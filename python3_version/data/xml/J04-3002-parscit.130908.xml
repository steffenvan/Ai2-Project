Subjectivity in natural language refers to aspects of language used to express opinions, evalua-
tions, and speculations. There are numerous natural language processing applications for which
subjectivity analysis is relevant, including information extraction and text categorization. The
goal of this work is learning subjective language from corpora. Clues of subjectivity are gener-
ated and tested, including low-frequency words, collocations, and adjectives and verbs identified
using distributional similarity. The features are also examined working together in concert. The
features, generated from different data sets using different procedures, exhibit consistency in
performance in that they all do better and worse on the same data sets. In addition, this article
shows that the density of subjectivity clues in the surrounding context strongly affects how likely
it is that a word is subjective, and it provides the results of an annotation study assessing the
subjectivity of sentences with high-density features. Finally, the clues are used to perform opinion
piece recognition (a type of text categorization and genre detection) to demonstrate the utility of
the knowledge acquired in this article.

Subjectivity in natural language refers to aspects of language used to express opin-
ions, evaluations, and speculations (Banfield 1982; Wiebe 1994). Many natural lan-
guage processing (NLP) applications could benefit from being able to distinguish
subjective language from language used to objectively present factual information.
Current extraction and retrieval technology focuses almost exclusively on the sub-
ject matter of documents. However, additional aspects of a document influence its
relevance, including evidential status and attitude (Kessler, Nunberg, Sch¨utze 1997).
Information extraction systems should be able to distinguish between factual infor-
mation (which should be extracted) and nonfactual information (which should be

discarded or labeled as uncertain). Question-answering systems should distinguish
between factual and speculative answers. Multi-perspective question answering aims
to present multiple answers to the user based upon speculation or opinions derived
from different sources (Carbonell 1979; Wiebe et al. 2003). Multidocument summa-
rization systems should summarize different opinions and perspectives. Automatic
subjectivity analysis would also be useful to perform flame recognition (Spertus 1997;
Kaufer 2000), e-mail classification (Aone, Ramos-Santacruze, and Niehaus 2000), intel-
lectual attribution in text (Teufel and Moens 2000), recognition of speaker role in radio
broadcasts (Barzialy et al. 2000), review mining (Terveen et al. 1997), review classifi-
cation (Turney 2002; Pang, Lee, and Vaithyanathan 2002), style in generation (Hovy
1987), and clustering documents by ideological point of view (Sack 1995). In general,
nearly any information-seeking system could benefit from knowledge of how opin-
ionated a text is and whether or not the writer purports to objectively present factual
material.
To perform automatic subjectivity analysis, good clues must be found. A huge
variety of words and phrases have subjective usages, and while some manually de-
veloped resources exist, such as dictionaries of affective language (General-Inquirer
2000; Heise 2000) and subjective features in general-purpose lexicons (e.g., the atti-
tude adverb features in Comlex [Macleod, Grishman, and Meyers 1998]), there is no
comprehensive dictionary of subjective language. In addition, many expressions with
subjective usages have objective usages as well, so a dictionary alone would not suffice.
An NLP system must disambiguate these expressions in context.
The goal of our work is learning subjective language from corpora. In this article,
we generate and test subjectivity clues and contextual features and use the knowledge
we gain to recognize subjective sentences and opinionated documents.
Two kinds of data are available to us: a relatively small amount of data manually
annotated at the expression level (i.e., labels on individual words and phrases) of Wall
Street Journal and newsgroup data and a large amount of data with existing document-
level annotations from the Wall Street Journal (opinion pieces, such as editorials and
reviews, versus nonopinion pieces). Both are used as training data to identify clues
of subjectivity. In addition, we cross-validate the results between the two types of
annotation: The clues learned from the expression-level data are evaluated against the
document-level annotations, and those learned using the document-level annotations
are evaluated against the expression-level annotations.
There were a number of motivations behind our decision to use document-level
annotations, in addition to our manual annotations, to identify and evaluate clues
of subjectivity. The document-level annotations were not produced according to our
annotation scheme and were not produced for the purpose of training and evaluating
an NLP system. Thus, they are an external influence from outside the laboratory. In
addition, there are a great number of these data, enabling us to evaluate the results
on a larger scale, using multiple large test sets. This and cross-training between the
two types of annotations allows us to assess consistency in performance of the various
identification procedures. Good performance in cross-validation experiments between
different types of annotations is evidence that the results are not brittle.
We focus on three types of subjectivity clues. The first are hapax legomena, the set
of words that appear just once in the corpus. We refer to them here as unique words.
The set of all unique words is a feature with high frequency and significantly higher
precision than baseline (Section 3.2).
The second are collocations (Section 3.3). We demonstrate a straightforward method
for automatically identifying collocational clues of subjectivity in texts. The method is
first used to identify fixed n-grams, such as of the century and get out of here. Interest-

ingly, many include noncontent words that are typically on stop lists of NLP systems
(e.g., of, the, get, out, here in the above examples). The method is then used to identify
an unusual form of collocation: One or more positions in the collocation may be filled
by any word (of an appropriate part of speech) that is unique in the test data.
The third type of subjectivity clue we examine here are adjective and verb fea-
tures identified using the results of a method for clustering words according to dis-
tributional similarity (Lin 1998) (Section 3.4). We hypothesized that two words may
be distributionally similar because they are both potentially subjective (e.g., tragic, sad,
and poignant are identified from bizarre). In addition, we use distributional similarity
to improve estimates of unseen events: A word is selected or discarded based on the
precision of it together with its n most similar neighbors.
We show that the various subjectivity clues perform better and worse on the same
data sets, exhibiting an important consistency in performance (Section 4.2).
In addition to learning and evaluating clues associated with subjectivity, we ad-
dress disambiguating them in context, that is, identifying instances of clues that are
subjective in context (Sections 4.3 and 4.4). We find that the density of clues in the
surrounding context is an important influence. Using two types of annotations serves
us well here, too. It enables us to use manual judgments to identify parameters for
disambiguating instances of automatically identified clues. High-density clues are high
precision in both the expression-level and document-level data. In addition, we give
the results of a new annotation study showing that most high-density clues are in sub-
jective text spans (Section 4.5). Finally, we use the clues together to perform document-
level classification, to further demonstrate the utility of the acquired knowledge (Sec-
tion 4.6).
At the end of the article, we discuss related work (Section 5) and conclusions
(Section 6).

Subjective language is language used to express private states in the context of a
text or conversation. Private state is a general covering term for opinions, evaluations,
emotions, and speculations (Quirk et al. 1985). The following are examples of subjective
sentences from a variety of document types.
The first two examples are from Usenet newsgroup messages:

A particular model of linguistic subjectivity underlies the current and past re-
search in this area by Wiebe and colleagues. It is most fully presented in Wiebe and
Rapaport (1986, 1988, 1991) and Wiebe (1990, 1994). It was developed to support NLP
research and combines ideas from several sources in fields outside NLP, especially
linguistics and literary theory. The most direct influences on the model were Dolezel
(1973) (types of subjectivity clues), Uspensky (1973) (types of point of view), Kuroda
(1973, 1976) (pragmatics of point of view), Chatman (1978) (story versus discourse),
Cohn (1978) (linguistic styles for presenting consciousness), Fodor (1979) (linguistic
description of opaque contexts), and especially Banfield (1982) (theory of subjectivity
versus communication).1
The remainder of this section sketches our conceptualization of subjectivity and
describes the annotation projects it underlies.
Subjective elements are linguistic expressions of private states in context. Subjec-
tive elements are often lexical (examples are stand in awe, unceasingly, fascinated in (3)
and eroding, sapping, and complains in (5)). They may be single words (e.g., complains)
or more complex expressions (e.g., stand in awe, what a NP). Purely syntactic or mor-
phological devices may also be subjective elements (e.g., fronting, parallelism, changes
in aspect).
A subjective element expresses the subjectivity of a source, who may be the writer
or someone mentioned in the text. For example, the source of fascinating in (4) is
the writer, while the source of the subjective elements in (5) is Maher (according to
the writer). In addition, a subjective element usually has a target, that is, what the
subjectivity is about or directed toward. In (4), the target is a tale; in (5), the target of
Maher’s subjectivity is the cost of health care.
Note our parenthetical above—“according to the writer”—concerning Maher’s
subjectivity. Maher is not directly speaking to us but is being quoted by the writer.
Thus, the source is a nested source, which we notate (writer, Maher); this represents
the fact that the subjectivity is being attributed to Maher by the writer. Since sources

are not directly addressed by the experiments presented in this article, we merely
illustrate the idea here with an example, to give the reader an idea:
The Foreign Ministry said Thursday that it was “surprised, to put it
mildly” by the U.S. State Department’s criticism of Russia’s human
rights record and objected in particular to the “odious” section on
Chechnya. (Moscow Times, March 8, 2002]
Let us consider some of the subjective elements in this sentence, along with their
sources:
surprised, to put it mildly: (writer, Foreign Ministry, Foreign Ministry)
to put it mildly: (writer, Foreign Ministry)
criticism: (writer, Foreign Ministry, Foreign Ministry, U.S. State Department)
objected: (writer, Foreign Ministry)
odious: (writer, Foreign Ministry)
Consider surprised, to put it mildly. This refers to a private state of the Foreign Ministry
(i.e., it is very surprised). This is in the context of The Foreign Ministry said, which is in
a sentence written by the writer. This gives us the three-level source (writer, Foreign
Ministry, Foreign Ministry). The phrase to put it mildly, which expresses sarcasm, is
attributed to the Foreign Ministry by the writer (i.e., according to the writer, the Foreign
Ministry said this). So its source is (writer, Foreign Ministry). The subjective element
criticism has a deeply nested source: According to the writer, the Foreign Ministry said
it is surprised by the U.S. State Department’s criticism.
The nested-source representation allows us to pinpoint the subjectivity in a sen-
tence. For example, there is no subjectivity attributed directly to the writer in the
above sentence: At the level of the writer, the sentence merely says that someone
said something and objected to something (without evaluating or questioning this).
If the sentence started The magnificent Foreign Ministry said... , then we would have an
additional subjective element, magnificent, with source (writer).
Note that subjective does not mean not true. Consider the sentence John criticized
Mary for smoking. The verb criticized is a subjective element, expressing negative eval-
uation, with nested source (writer, John). But this does not mean that John does not
believe that Mary smokes. (In addition, the fact that John criticized Mary is being
presented as true by the writer.)
Similarly, objective does not mean true. A sentence is objective if the language used
to convey the information suggests that facts are being presented; in the context of
the discourse, material is objectively presented as if it were true. Whether or not the
source truly believes the information, and whether or not the information is in fact
true, are considerations outside the purview of a theory of linguistic subjectivity.
An aspect of subjectivity highlighted when we are working with NLP applications
is ambiguity. Many words with subjective usages may be used objectively. Examples
are sapping and eroding. In (5), they are used subjectively, but one can easily imagine
objective usages, in a scientific domain, for example. Thus, an NLP system may not
merely consult a list of lexical items to accurately identify subjective language but
must disambiguate words, phrases, and sentences in context. In our terminology, a
potential subjective element (PSE) is a linguistic element that may be used to express

In our subjectivity annotation projects, we do not give the annotators lists of particular
words and phrases to look for. Rather, we ask them to label sentences according to
their interpretations in context. As a result, the annotators consider a large variety of
expressions when performing annotations.
We use data that have been manually annotated at the expression level, the sen-
tence level, and the document level. For diversity, we use data from the Wall Street
Journal Treebank as well as data from a corpus of Usenet newsgroup messages. Table
1 summarizes the data sets and annotations used in this article. None of the datasets
overlap. The annotation types listed in the table are those used in the experiments
presented in this article.
In our first subjectivity annotation project (Wiebe, Bruce, and O’Hara 1999; Bruce
and Wiebe 1999), a corpus of sentences from the Wall Street Journal Treebank Corpus
(Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz 1993) (corpus WSJ-SE in Table 1) was annotated
at the sentence level by multiple judges. The judges were instructed to classify a sen-
tence as subjective if it contained any significant expressions of subjectivity, attributed
to either the writer or someone mentioned in the text, and to classify the sentence as
objective, otherwise. After multiple rounds of training, the annotators independently
annotated a fresh test set of 500 sentences from WSJ-SE. They achieved an average
pairwise kappa score of 0.70 over the entire test set, an average pairwise kappa score
of 0.80 for the 85% of the test set for which the annotators were somewhat sure of
their judgments, and an average pairwise kappa score of 0.88 for the 70% of the test
set for which the annotators were very sure of their judgments.
We later asked the same annotators to identify the subjective elements in WSJ-
SE. Specifically, each annotator was given the subjective sentences he identified in

the previous study and asked to put brackets around the words he believed caused
the sentence to be classified as subjective.2 For example (subjective elements are in
parentheses):
They paid (yet) more for (really good stuff).
(Perhaps you’ll forgive me) for reposting his response.
No other instructions were given to the annotators and no training was performed for
the expression-level task. A single round of tagging was performed, with no commu-
nication between annotators. There are techniques for analyzing agreement when an-
notations involve segment boundaries (Litman and Passonneau 1995; Marcu, Romera,
and Amorortu 1999), but our focus in this article is on words. Thus, our analyses are
at the word level: Each word is classified as either appearing in a subjective element
or not. Punctuation and numbers are excluded from the analyses. The kappa value for
word agreement in this study is 0.42.
Another two-level annotation project was performed in Wiebe et al. (2001), this
time involving document-level and expression-level annotations of newsgroup data
(NG-FE in Table 1). In that project, we were interested in annotating flames, inflam-
matory messages in newsgroups or listservs. Note that inflammatory language is a
kind of subjective language. The annotators were instructed to mark a message as
a flame if the main intention of the message is a personal attack and the message
contains insulting or abusive language.
After multiple rounds of training, three annotators independently annotated a
fresh test set of 88 messages from NG-FE. The average pairwise percentage agreement
is 92% and the average pairwise kappa value is 0.78. These results are comparable to
those of Spertus (1997), who reports 98% agreement on noninflammatory messages
and 64% agreement on inflammatory messages.
Two of the annotators were then asked to identify the flame elements in the entire
corpus NG-FE. Flame elements are the subset of subjective elements that are perceived
to be inflammatory. The two annotators were asked to do this in the entire corpus, even
those messages not identified as flames, because messages that were not judged to be
flames at the document level may contain some individual inflammatory phrases. As
above, no training was performed for the expression-level task, and a single round of
tagging was performed, without communication between annotators. Agreement was
measured in the same way as in the subjective-element study above. The kappa value
for flame element annotations in corpus NG-FE is 0.46.
An additional annotation project involved a single annotator, who performed
subjective-element annotations on the newsgroup corpus NG-SE.
The agreement results above suggest that good levels of agreement can be achieved
at higher levels of classification (sentence and document), but agreement at the expres-
sion level is more challenging. The agreement values are lower for the expression-level
annotations but are still much higher than that expected by chance.
Note that our word-based analysis of agreement is a tough measure, because it
requires that exactly the same words be identified by both annotators. Consider the
following example from WSJ-SE:
D: (played the role well) (obligatory ragged jeans a thicket of long hair
and rejection of all things conventional)

M: played the role (well) (obligatory) (ragged) jeans a (thicket) of long
hair and (rejection) of (all things conventional)
Judge D in the example consistently identifies entire phrases as subjective, while judge
M prefers to select discrete lexical items.
Despite such differences between annotators, the expression-level annotations
proved very useful for exploring hypotheses and generating features, as described
below.
Since this article was written, a new annotation project has been completed. A
10,000-sentence corpus of English-language versions of world news articles has been
annotated with detailed subjectivity information as part of a project investigating
multiple-perspective question answering (Wiebe et al. 2003). These annotations are
much more detailed than the annotations used in this article (including, for example,
the source of each private state). The interannotator agreement scores for the new
corpus are high and are improvements over the results of the studies described above
(Wilson and Wiebe 2003).
The current article uses existing document-level subjective classes, namely edito-
rials, letters to the editor, Arts &amp; Leisure reviews, and Viewpoints in the Wall Street
Journal. These are subjective classes in the sense that they are text categories for which
subjectivity is a key aspect. We refer to them collectively as opinion pieces. All other
types of documents in the Wall Street Journal are collectively referred to as nonopinion
pieces.
Note that opinion pieces are not 100% subjective. For example, editorials contain
objective sentences presenting facts supporting the writer’s argument, and reviews
contain sentences objectively presenting facts about the product beign reviewed. Sim-
ilarly, nonopinion pieces are not 100% objective. News reports present opinions and
reactions to reported events (van Dijk 1988); they often contain segments starting with
expressions such as critics claim and supporters argue. In addition, quoted-speech sen-
tences in which individuals express their subjectivity are often included (Barzilay et
al. 2000). For concreteness, let us consider WSJ-SE, which, recall, has been manually
annotated at the sentence level. In WSJ-SE, 70% of the sentences in opinion pieces
are subjective and 30% are objective. In nonopinion pieces, 44% of the sentences are
subjective and only 56% are objective. Thus, while there is a higher concentration of
subjective sentences in opinion versus nonopinion pieces, there are many subjective
sentences in nonopinion pieces and objective sentences in opinion pieces.
An inspection of some data reveals that some editorial and review articles are not
marked as such by the Wall Street Journal. For example, there are articles whose purpose
is to present an argument rather than cover a news story, but they are not explicitly
labeled as editorials by the Wall Street Journal. Thus, the opinion piece annotations of
data sets OP1 and OP2 in Table 1 have been manually refined. The annotation instruc-
tions were simply to identify any additional opinion pieces that were not marked as
such. To test the reliability of this annotation, two judges independently annotated
two Wall Street Journal files, W9-22 and W9-33, each containing approximately 160,000
words. This is an “annotation lite” task: With no training, the annotators achieved
kappa values of 0.94 and 0.95, and each spent an average of three hours per Wall
Street Journal file.

ing the expression-level subjective-element annotations as training data, and some
are learned using the document-level opinion piece annotations as training data (i.e.,
opinion piece versus nonopinion piece). All of the clues are evaluated with respect to
the document-level opinion piece annotations. While these evaluations are our focus,
because many more opinion piece than subjective-element data exist, we do evaluate
the clues learned from the opinion piece data on the subjective-element data as well.
Thus, we cross-validate the results both ways between the two types of annotations.
Throughout this section, we evaluate sets of clues directly, by measuring the pro-
portion of clues that appear in subjective documents or expressions, seeking those that
appear more often than expected. In later sections, the clues are used together to find
subjective sentences and to perform text categorization.
The following paragraphs give details of the evaluation and experimental design
used in this section.

In the above, S is a set of types (not tokens). The counts are of tokens (i.e., instances
or occurrences) of members of S.
Why use a set rather than individual items? Many good clues of subjectivity occur
with low frequency (Wiebe, McKeever, and Bruce 1998). In fact, as we shall see below,
uniqueness in the corpus is an informative feature for subjectivity classification. Thus,
we do not want to discard low-frequency clues, because they are a valuable source of
information, and we do not want to evaluate individual low-frequency lexical items,
because the results would be unreliable. Our strategy is thus to identify and evaluate
sets of words and phrases, rather than individual items.
What kinds of results may we expect? We cannot expect absolutely high precision
with respect to the opinion piece classifications, even for strong clues, for three reasons.
First, for our purposes, the data are noisy. As mentioned above, while the proportion
of subjective sentences is higher in opinion than in nonopinion pieces, the proportions
are not 100 and 0: Opinion pieces contain objective sentences, and nonopinion pieces
contain subjective sentences.
Second, we are trying to learn lexical items associated with subjectivity, that is,
PSEs. As discussed above, many words and phrases with subjective usages have ob-
jective usages as well. Thus, even in perfect data with no noise, we would not expect
100% precision. (This is the motivation for the work on density presented in section
4.4.)
Third, the distribution of opinions and nonopinions is highly skewed in favor of
nonopinions: Only 9% of the articles in the combination of OP1 and OP2 are opinion
pieces.
In this work, increases in precision over a baseline precision are used as evidence
that promising sets of PSEs have been found. Our main baseline for comparison is
the number of word instances in opinion pieces, divided by the total number of word
instances:
Baseline Precision =
number of word instances in opinion pieces

Words and phrases with higher proportions than this appear more than expected in
opinion pieces.
To further evaluate the quality of a set of PSEs, we also perform the following
significance test. For a set of PSEs in a given data set, we test the significance of the
difference between (1) the proportion of words in opinion pieces that are PSEs and (2)
the proportion of words in nonopinion pieces that are PSEs, using the z-significance
test for two proportions.
Before we continue, there are a few more technical items to mention concerning
the data preparation and experimental design:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.909346">
• All of the data sets are stemmed using Karp’s morphological analyzer
(Karp et al. 1994) and part-of-speech tagged using Brill’s (1992) tagger.
• When the opinion piece classifications are used for training, the existing
classifications, assigned by the Wall Street Journal, are used. Thus, the
processes using them as training data may be applied to more data to
learn more clues, without requiring additional manual annotation.
• When the opinion piece data are used for testing, the manually refined
classifications (described at the end of Section 2.1) are used.
• OP1 and OP2 together comprise eight treebank files. Below, we often
give results separately for the component files, allowing us to assess the
consistency of results for the various types of clues.

3.2 Unique Words

In this section, we show that low-frequency words are associated with subjectivity in
both the subjective-element and opinion piece data. Apparently, people are creative
when they are being opinionated.
Table 2 gives results for unique words in subjective-element data. Recall that
unique words are those that appear just once in the corpus, that is, hapax legomena.
The first row of Table 2 gives the frequency of unique words in WSJ-SE, followed
by the percentage-point improvements in precision over baseline for unique words in
subjective elements marked by two annotators (denoted as D and M in the table). The
second row gives baseline frequency and precisions. Baseline frequency is the total

but the precision of unique words in these same annotations is 0.20, 0.12 points higher
than the baseline. This is a 150% improvement over the baseline.
The number of unique words in opinion pieces is also higher than expected. Table
3 compares the precision of the set of unique words to the baseline precision (i.e.,
the precision of the set of all words that appear in the corpus) in the four WSJ files
composing OP1. Before this analysis was performed, numbers were removed from the
data (we are not interested in the fact that, say, the number 163,213.01 appears just once
in the corpus). The number of words in each data set and baseline precisions are listed
at the bottom of the table. The freq columns give total frequencies. The +prec columns
show the percentage-point improvements in precision over baseline. For example, in
W9-10, unique words have precision 0.34: 0.18 baseline plus an improvement over
baseline of 0.16. The difference in the proportion of words that are unique in opinion
pieces and the proportion of words that are unique in nonopinion pieces is highly
significant, with p &lt; 0.001 (z ≥ 22) for all of the data sets. Note that not only does the
set of unique words have higher than baseline precision, the set is a frequent feature.
The question arises, how does corpus size affect the precision of the set of unique
words? Presumably, uniqueness in a larger corpus is more meaningful than uniqueness
in a smaller one. The results in Figure 1 provide evidence that it is. The y-axis in Figure
1 represents increase in precision over baseline and the x-axis represents corpus size.
Five graphs are plotted, one for the set of words that appear exactly once (uniques),
one for the set of words that appear exactly twice ( freq2), one for the set of words that
appear exactly three times ( freq3), etc.
In Figure 1, increases in precision are given for corpora of size n, where n =
20,40,..., 2420, 2440 documents. Each data point is an average over 25 sample corpora
of size n. The sample corpora were chosen from the concatenation of OP1 and OP2, in
which 9% of the documents are opinion pieces. The sample corpora were created by
randomly selecting documents from the large corpus, preserving the 9% distribution
of opinion pieces. At the smallest corpus size (containing 20 documents), the average
number of words is 9,617. At the largest corpus size (containing 2440 documents), the
average is 1,225,186 words.
As can be seen in the figure, the precision of unique and other low-frequency
words increases with corpus size, with increases tapering off at the largest corpus size
tested. Words with frequency 2 also realize a nice increase, although one that is not as
dramatic, in precision over baseline. Even words of frequency 3, 4, and 5 show modest
increases.
To help us understand the importance of low-frequency words in large as opposed
to small data sets, we can consider the following analogy. With collectible trading
cards, rare cards are the most valuable. However, if we have some cards and are
trying to determine thier value, looking in only a few packs of cards will not tell us if

3.3 Identifying Potentially Subjective Collocations from Subjective-Element and
Flame-Element Annotations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998916875">
In this section, we describe experiments in identifying potentially subjective colloca-
tions.
Collocations are selected from the subjective-element data (i.e., NG-SE, NG-FE, and
WSJ-SE), using the union of the annotators’ tags for the data sets tagged by multiple
taggers. The results are then evaluated on opinion piece data.
The selection procedure is as follows. First, all 1-grams, 2-grams, 3-grams, and
4-grams are extracted from the data. In this work, each constituent of an n-gram is
a word-stem, part-of-speech pair. For example, (in-prep the-det can-noun) is a 3-gram
that matches trigrams consisting of preposition in, followed by determiner the, and
ending with noun can.
A subset of the n-grams are then selected based on precision. The precision of an
n-gram is the number of subjective instances of that n-gram in the data divided by
the total number of instances of that n-gram in the data. An instance of an n-gram is
subjective if each word occurs in a subjective element in the data.
n-grams are selected based on two criteria. First, the precision of the n-gram must
be greater than the baseline precision (i.e., the proportion of all word instances that
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.934276">
288
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.90213675">
Wiebe, Wilson, Bruce, Bell, and Martin Learning Subjective Language
are in subjective elements). Second, the precision of the n-gram must be greater than
the maximum precision of its constituents. This criterion is used to avoid selecting
unnecessarily long collocations. For example, scumbag is a strongly subjective clue. If
be a scumbag does not have higher precision than scumbag alone, we do not want to
select it.
Specifically, let (W1, W2) be a bigram consisting of consecutive words W1 and W2.
(W1,W2) is identified as a potential subjective element if prec(W1,W2) ≥ 0.1 and:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.968114">
prec(W1,W2) &gt; max(prec(W1), prec(W2))
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9843015">
For trigrams, we extend the second condition as follows. Let (W1, W2, W3) be a trigram
consisting of consecutive words W1, W2, and W3. The condition is then
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.999119333333333">
prec(W1, W2, W3) &gt; max(prec(W1,W2),prec(W3))
or
prec(W1, W2, W3) &gt; max(prec(W1),prec(W2, W3))
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999987483870968">
The selection of 4-grams is similar to the selection of 3-grams, comparing the 4-gram
first with the maximum of the precisions of word W1 and trigram (W2, W3, W4) and
then with the maximum of the precisions of trigram (W1,W2,W3) and word W4. We
call the n-gram collocations identified as above fixed-n-grams.
We also define a type of collocation called a unique generalized n-gram (ugen-n-
gram). Such collocations have placeholders for unique words. As will be seen below,
these are our highest-precision features.
To find and select such generalized collocations, we first find every word that
appears just once in the corpus and replace it with a new word, UNIQUE (but re-
membering the part of speech of the original word). In essence, we treat the set of
single-instance words as a single, frequently occurring word (which occurs with var-
ious parts of speech). Precisely the same method used for extracting and selecting
n-grams above is used to obtain the potentially subjective collocations with one or
more positions filled by a UNIQUE, part-of-speech pair.
To test the ugen-n-grams extracted from the subjective-element training data using
the method outlined above, we assess their precision with respect to opinion piece
data. As with the training data, all unique words in the test data are replaced by
UNIQUE. When a ugen-n-gram is matched against the test data, the UNIQUE fillers
match words (of the appropriate parts of speech) that are unique in the test data.
Table 4 shows the results of testing the fixed-n-gram and the ugen-n-gram patterns
identified as described above on the four data sets composing OP1. The freq columns
give total frequencies, and the +prec columns show the improvements in precision
from the baseline. The number of words in each data set and baseline precisions are
given at the bottom of the table. For all n-gram features besides the fixed-4-grams and
ugen-4-grams, the proportion of features in opinion pieces is significantly greater than
the proportion of features in nonopinion pieces.3
The question arises, how much overlap is there between instances of fixed-n-grams
and instances of ugen-n-grams? In the test data of Table 4, there are a total of 8,577
fixed-n-grams instances. Only 59 of these, fewer than 1% are contained (wholly or in
part) in ugen-n-gram instances. This small intersection set shows that two different
types of potentially subjective collocations are being recognized.

Algorithm for selecting adjective and verb features using distributional similarity.
motivation for experimenting with it to identify PSEs was twofold. First, we hypoth-
esized that words might be distributionally similar because they share pragmatic us-
ages, such as expressing subjectivity, even if they are not close synonyms. Second,
as shown above, low-frequency words appear more often in subjective texts than ex-
pected. We did not want to discard all low-frequency words from consideration but
cannot effectively judge the suitability of individual words. Thus, to decide whether
to retain a word as a PSE, we consider the precision not of the individual word, but
of the word together with a cluster of words similar to it.
Many variants of distributional similarity have been used in NLP (Lee 1999; Lee
and Pereira 1999). Dekang Lin’s (1998) method is used here. In contrast to many
implementations, which focus exclusively on verb-noun relationships, Lin’s method
incorporates a variety of syntactic relations. This is important for subjectivity recogni-
tion, because PSEs are not limited to verb-noun relationships. In addition, Lin’s results
are freely available.
A set of seed words begins the process. For each seed si, the precision of the set
{si}UCi,n in the training data is calculated, where Ci,n is the set of n words most similar
to si, according to Lin’s (1998) method. If the precision of {si} U Ci,n is greater than a
threshold T, then the words in this set are retained as PSEs. If it is not, neither si nor
the words in Ci,n are retained. The union of the retained sets will be denoted RT,n, that
is, the union of all sets {si} U Ci,n with precision on the training set &gt; T.
In Wiebe (2000), the seeds (the sis) were extracted from the subjective-element
annotations in corpus WSJ-SE. Specifically, the seeds were the adjectives that appear
at least once in a subjective element in WSJ-SE. In this article, the opinion piece corpus
is used to move beyond the manual annotations and small corpus of the earlier work,
and a much looser criterion is used to choose the initial seeds: All of the adjectives
(verbs) in the training data are used.
The algorithm for the process is given in Figure 2. There is one small difference
for adjectives and verbs noted in the figure, that is, the precision threshold of 0.28 for

adjectives versus 0.23 for verbs. These thresholds were determined using validation
data.
Seeds and their clusters are assessed on a training set for many parameter settings
(cluster size n from 2 through 40, and precision threshold T from 0.01 through 0.70
by .03). As mentioned above, each (n, T) parameter pair yields a set of adjectives RT,n,
that is, the union of all sets {si} U Ci,n with precision on the training set &gt; T. A subset,
ADJpses, of those sets is chosen based on precision and frequency in a validation set.
Finally, the ADJpses are tested on the test set.
Table 7 shows the results for four opinion piece test sets. Multiple training-
validation data set pairs are used for each test set, as given in Table 7. The results
are for the union of the adjectives (verbs) chosen for each pair. The freq columns give
total frequencies, and the +prec columns show the improvements in precision from
the baseline. For each data set, the difference between the proportion of instances
of ADJpses in opinion pieces and the proportion in nonopinion pieces is significant

figures for each set of subjective-element annotations. The right side of the table gives
the average frequencies and increases in precision over baseline for the ADJpses and
VERBpses sets on the subjective-element data. The baseline figures in the table are the
frequencies and precisions of the sets of adjectives and verbs that appear at least once
in a subjective element. Since these sets include words that appear just once in the
corpus (and thus have 100% precision), the baseline precision is a challenging one.
Testing the VERBpses and ADJpses on the subjective-element data reveals some inter-
esting consistencies for these subjectivity clues. The precision increases of the VERBpses
on the subjective-element data are comparable to their increases on the opinion piece
data. Similarly, the precision increases of the ADJpses on the subjective-element data
are as good as or better than the performance of this set of PSEs on the opinion piece
data. Finally, the precisions increases for the ADJpses are higher than for the VERBpses
on all data sets. This is again consistent with the higher performance of the ADJpses
sets in the opinion piece data sets.

4.3 Choosing Density Parameters from Subjective-Element Data
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998753782608696">
In Wiebe (1994), whether a PSE is interpreted to be subjective depends, in part, on
how subjective the surrounding context is. We explore this idea in the current work,
assessing whether PSEs are more likely to be subjective if they are surrounded by sub-
jective elements. In particular, we experiment with a density feature to decide whether
or not a PSE instance is subjective: If a sufficient number of subjective elements are
nearby, then the PSE instance is considered to be subjective; otherwise, it is discarded.
The density parameters are a window size W and a frequency threshold T.
In this section, we explore the density of manually annotated PSEs in subjective-
element data and choose density parameters to use in Section 4.4, in which we apply
them to automatically identified PSEs in opinion piece data.
The process for calculating density in the subjective-element data is given in Fig-
ure 3. The PSEs are defined to be all adjectives, verbs, modals, nouns, and adverbs that
appear at least once in a subjective element, with the exception of some stop words
(line 0 of Figure 3). Note that these PSEs depend only on the subjective-element man-
ual annotations, not on the automatically identified features used elsewhere in the
article or on the document-level opinion piece classes. PSEinsts is the set of PSE
instances to be disambiguated (line 1). HiDensity (initialized on line 2) will be the
subset of PSEinsts that are retained. In the loop, the density of each PSE instance
P is calculated. This is the number of subjective elements that begin or end in the
W words preceding or following P (line 6). P is retained if its density is at least T
(line 7).
Lines 8–9 of the algorithm assess the precision of the original (PSEinsts) and new
(HiDensity) sets of PSE instances. If prec(HiDensity) is greater than prec(PSEinsts), then

there is evidence that the number of subjective elements near a PSE instance is related
to its subjectivity in context.
To create more data points for this analysis, WSJ-SE was split into two (WSJ-SE1
and WSJ-SE2) and annotations of the two judges are considered separately. WSJ-SE2-D,
for example, refers to D’s annotations of WSJ-SE2. The process in Figure 3 was repeated
for different parameter settings (T in [1, 2,4,..., 48] and W in [1, 10, 20, ... , 490]) on each
of the SE data sets. To find good parameter settings, the results for each data set were
sorted into five-point precision intervals and then sorted by frequency within each
interval. Information for the top three precision intervals for each data set are shown
in Table 10, specifically, the parameter values (i.e., T and W) and the frequency and
precision of the most frequent result in each interval. The intervals are in the rows
labeled Range. For example, the top three precision intervals for WSJ-SE1-M, 0.87-0.92,
0.82-0.87, and 0.77-0.82 (no parameter values yield higher precision than 0.92). The
top of Table 10 gives baseline frequencies and precisions, which are IPSEinstsl and
prec(PSEinsts), respectively, in line 8 of Figure 3.
The parameter values exhibit a range of frequencies and precisions, with the ex-
pected trade-off between precision and frequency. We choose the following parameters
to test in Section 4.4: For each data set, for each precision interval whose lower bound
is at least 10 percentage points higher than the baseline for that data set, the top
two (T, W) pairs yielding the highest frequencies in that interval are chosen. Among
the five data sets, a total of 45 parameter pairs were so selected. This exercise was
completed once, without experimenting with different parameter settings.

automatically identified PSEs described in Section 3, for which results are given in
Table 9.
Second, in Figure 4, we assess precision with respect to the document-level classes
(lines 7–8). The test data are OP1.
An interesting question arose when we were defining the PSE instances: What
should be done with words that are identified to be PSEs (or parts of PSEs) according
to multiple criteria? For example, sunny, radiant, and exhilarating are all unique in
corpus OP1, and are all members of the adjective PSE feature defined for testing
on OP1. Collocations add additional complexity. For example, consider the sequence
and splendidly, which appears in the test data. The sequence and splendidly matches
the ugen-2-gram (and-conj U-adj), and the word splendidly is unique. In addition, a
sequence may match more than one n-gram feature. For example, is it that matches
three fixed-n-gram features: is it, is it that, and it that.
In the current experiments, the more PSEs a word matches, the more weight it
is given. The hypothesis behind this treatment is that additional matches represent
additional evidence that a PSE instance is subjective. This hypothesis is realized as
follows: Each match of each member of each type of PSE is considered to be a PSE
instance. Thus, among them, there are 11 members in PSEinsts for the five phrases
sunny, radiant, exhilarating, and splendidly, and is it that, one for each of the matches
mentioned above.
The process in Figure 4 was conducted with the 45 parameter pair values (T and
W) chosen from the subjective-element data as described in Section 4.3. Table 11 shows
results for a subset of the 45 parameters, namely, the most frequent parameter pair
chosen from the top three precision intervals for each training set. The bottom of the
table gives a baseline frequency and a baseline precision in OP1, defined as |PSEinsts|
and prec(PSEinsts), respectively, in line 7 of Figure 4.
The density features result in substantial increases in precision. Of the 45 parameter
pairs, the minimum percentage increase over baseline is 22%. Fully 24% of the 45
parameter pairs yield increases of 200% or more; 38% yield increases between 100%

and 199%, and 38% yield increases between 22% and 99%. In addition, the increases
are significant. Using the set of high-density PSEs defined by the parameter pair with
the least increase over baseline, we tested the difference in the proportion of PSEs
in opinion pieces that are high-density and the proportion of PSEs in nonopinion
pieces that are high-density. The difference between these two proportions is highly
significant (z = 46.2, p &lt; 0.0001).
Notice that, except for one blip (T, W = 6,10 under WSJ-SE-M), the precisions
decrease and the frequencies increase as we go down each column in Table 11. The
same pattern can be observed with all 45 parameter pairs (results not included here
because of space considerations). But the parameter pairs are ordered in Table 11
based on performance in the manually annotated subjective-element data, not based
on performance in the test data. For example, the entry in the first row, first column
(T, W = 10, 20) is the parameter pair giving the highest frequency in the top precision
interval of WSJ-SE-M (frequency and precision in WSJ-SE-M, using the process of
Figure 3). Thus, the relative precisions and frequencies of the parameter pairs are
carried over from the training to the test data. This is quite a strong result, given that
the PSEs in the training data are from manual annotations, while the PSEs in the test
data are our automatically identified features.

4.5 High-Density Sentence Annotations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999954538461538">
To assess the subjectivity of sentences with high-density PSEs, we extracted the 133
sentences in corpus OP2 that contain at least one high-density PSE and manually
annotated them. We refer to these sentences as the system-identified sentences.
We chose the density-parameter pair (T, W = 12,30), based on its precision and
frequency in OP1. This parameter setting yields results that have relatively high pre-
cision and low frequency. We chose a low-frequency setting to make the annotation
study feasible.
The extracted sentences were independently annotated by two judges. One is a
coauthor of this article (judge 1), and the other has performed subjectivity annota-
tion before, but is not otherwise involved in this research (judge 2). Sentences were
annotated according to the coding instructions of Wiebe, Bruce, and O’Hara (1999)
which, recall, are to classify a sentence as subjective if there is a significant expression
of subjectivity of either the writer or someone mentioned in the text, in the sentence.

Judge 1 classified 103 of the system-identified sentences as subjective, 16 as ob-
jective, and 14 as unsure. Judge 2 classified 102 of the system-identified sentences as
subjective, 27 as objective; and 4 as unsure. The contingency table is given in Table 13.4
The kappa value using all three classes is 0.60, reflecting the highly skewed distri-
bution in favor of subjective sentences, and the disagreement on the lower-frequency
classes (unsure and objective). Consistent with the findings in Wiebe, Bruce, and
O’Hara (1999), the kappa value for agreement on the sentences for which neither
judge is unsure is very high: 0.86.
A different breakdown of the sentences is illuminating. For 98 of the sentences (call
them SS), judges 1 and 2 tag the sentence as subjective. Among the other sentences, 20
appear in a block of contiguous system-identified sentences that includes a member of
SS. For example, in Table 12, (2.a) and (2.c) are in SS and (2.b) is in the same block of
subjective sentences as they are. Similarly, (3.a) is in SS and (3.b) is in the same block.
Among the remaining 15 sentences, 6 are adjacent to subjective sentences that
were not identified by our system (so were not annotated by the judges). All of those
sentences contain significant expressions of subjectivity of the writer or someone men-
tioned in the text, the criterion used in this work for classifying a sentence as subjective.
Samples are shown in Table 14.
Thus, 93% of the sentences identified by the system are subjective or are near
subjective sentences. All the sentences, together with their tags and the sentences
adjacent to them, are available on the Web at www.cs.pitt.edu/˜wiebe.

our PSEs, we achieve positive results in opinion-piece classification using the basic k-
nearest-neighbor (KNN) algorithm with leave-one-out cross-validation (Mitchell 1997).
Given a document, the basic KNN algorithm classifies the document according to
the majority classification of the document’s k closest neighbors. For our purposes, each
document is characterized by one feature, the count of all PSE instances (regardless
of type) in the document, normalized by document length in words. The distance
between two documents is simply the absolute value of the difference between the
normalized PSE counts for the two documents.
With leave-one-out cross-validation, the set of n documents to be classified is
divided into a training set of size n−1 and a validation set of size 1. The one document
in the validation set is then classified according to the majority classification of its k
closest-neighbor documents in the training set. This process is repeated until every
document is classified.
Which value to use for k is chosen during a preprocessing phase. During the pre-
processing phase, we run the KNN algorithm with leave-one-out cross-validation on
a separate training set, for odd values of k from 1 to 15. The value of k that results in
the best classification during the preprocessing phase is the one used for later KNN
classification.
For the classification experiment, the data set OP1 was used in the preprocess-
ing phase to select the value of k, and then classification was performed on the 1,222
documents in OP2. During training on OP1, k equal to 15 resulted in the best classifi-
cation. On the test set, OP2, we achieved a classification accuracy of 0.939; the baseline
accuracy for choosing the most frequent class (nonopinion pieces) was 0.915. Our clas-
sification accuracy represents a 28% reduction in error and is significantly better than
baseline according to McNemar’s test (Everitt 1997).
The positive results from the opinion piece classification show the usefulness of
the various PSE features when used together.

5. Relation to Other Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998457809523809">
There has been much work in other fields, including linguistics, literary theory, psy-
chology, philosophy, and content analysis, involving subjective language. As men-
tioned in Section 2, the conceptualization underlying our manual annotations is based
on work in literary theory and linguistics, most directly Dole˘zel (1973), Uspensky
(1973), Kuroda (1973, 1976), Chatman (1978), Cohn (1978), Fodor (1979), and Banfield
(1982). We also mentioned existing knowledge resources such as affective lexicons
(General-Inquirer 2000; Heise 2000) and annotations in more general-purpose lexicons
(e.g., the attitude adverb features in Comlex [Macleod, Grishman, and Meyers 1998]).
Such knowledge may be used in future work to complement the work presented in
this article, for example, to seed the distributional-similarity process described in Sec-
tion 3.4.
There is also work in fields such as content analysis and psychology on statisti-
cally characterizing texts in terms of word lists manually developed for distinctions
related to subjectivity. For example, Hart (1984) performs counts on a manually de-
veloped list of words and rhetorical devices (e.g., “sacred” terms such as freedom)
in political speeches to explore potential reasons for public reactions. Anderson and
McMaster (1998) use fixed sets of high-frequency words to assign connotative scores
to documents and sections of documents along dimensions such as how pleasant,
acrimonious, pious, or confident, the text is.
What distinguishes our work from work on subjectivity in other fields is that
we focus on (1) automatically learning knowledge from corpora, (2) automatically

performing contextual disambiguation, and (3) using knowledge of subjectivity in
NLP applications. This article expands and integrates the work reported in Wiebe and
Wilson (2002), Wiebe, Wilson, and Bell (2001), Wiebe et al. (2001) and Wiebe (2000).
Previous work in NLP on the same or related tasks includes sentence-level and
document-level subjectivity classifications. At the sentence level, Wiebe, Bruce, and
O’Hara (1999) developed a machine learning system to classify sentences as subjec-
tive or objective. The accuracy of the system was more than 20 percentage points
higher than a baseline accuracy. Five part-of-speech features, two lexical features, and
a paragraph feature were used. These results suggested to us that there are clues to
subjectivity that might be learned automatically from text and motivated the work
reported in the current article. The system was tested in 10-fold cross validation ex-
periments using corpus WSJ-SE, a small corpus of only 1,001 sentences. As discussed
in Section 1, a main goal of our current work is to exploit existing document-level
annotations, because they enable us to use much larger data sets, they were created
outside our research group, and they allow us to assess consistency of performance
by cross-validating between our manual annotations and the existing document-level
annotations. Because the document-level data are not annotated at the sentence level,
sentence-level classification is not highlighted in this article. The new sentence annota-
tion study to evaluate sentences with high-density features (Section 4.5) uses different
data from WSJ-SE, because some of the features (n-grams and density parameters)
were identified using WSJ-SE as training data.
Other previous work in NLP has addressed related document-level classifications.
Spertus (1997) developed a system for recognizing inflammatory messages. As men-
tioned earlier in the article, inflammatory language is a type of subjective language,
so the task she addresses is closely related to ours. She uses machine learning to
select among manually developed features. In contrast, the focus in our work is on
automatically identifying features from the data.
A number of projects investigating genre detection include editorials as one of the
targeted genres. For example, in Karlgren and Cutting (1994), editorials are one of fif-
teen categories, and in Kessler, Nunberg, and Sch¨utze (1997), editorials are one of six.
Given the goal of these works to perform genre detection in general, they use low-level
features that are not specific to editorials. Neither shows significant improvements for
editorial recognition. Argamon, Koppel, and Avneri (1998) address a slightly different
task, though it does involve editorials. Their goal is to distinguish not only, for ex-
ample, news from editorials, but also these categories in different publications. Their
best results are distinguishing among the news categories of different publications;
their lowest results involve editorials. Because we focus specifically on distinguishing
opinion pieces from nonopinion pieces, our results are better than theirs for those
categories. In addition, in contrast to the above studies, the focus of our work is on
learning features of subjectivity. We perform opinion piece recognition in order to
assess the usefulness of the various features when used together.
Other previous NLP research has used features similar to ours for other NLP tasks.
Low-frequency words have been used as features in information extraction (Weeber,
Vos, and Baayen 2000) and text categorization (Copeck et al. 2000). A number of
researchers have worked on mining collocations from text to extend lexicographic
resources for machine translation and word sense disambiguation (e.g., Smajda 1993;
Lin 1999; Biber 1993).
In Samuel, Carberry, and Vijay-Shanker’s (1998) work on identifying collocations
for dialog-act recognition, a filter similar to ours was used to eliminate redundant
n-gram features: n-grams were eliminated if they contained substrings with the same
entropy score as or a better entropy score than the n-gram.

While it is common in studies of collocations to omit low-frequency words and
expressions from analysis, because they give rise to invalid or unrealistic statistical
measures (Church and Hanks, 1990), we are able to identify higher-precision colloca-
tions by including placeholders for unique words (i.e., the ugen-n-grams). We are not
aware of other work that uses such collocations as we do.
Features identified using distributional similarity have previously been used for
syntactic and semantic disambiguation (Hindle 1990; Dagan, Pereira, and Lee 1994)
and to develop lexical resources from corpora (Lin 1998; Riloff and Jones 1999).
We are not aware of other work identifying and using density parameters as
described in this article.
Since our experiments, other related work in NLP has been performed. Some of
this work addresses related but different classification tasks. Three studies classify
reviews as positive or negative (Turney 2002; Pang, Lee, and Vaithyanathan 2002;
Dave, Lawrence, Pennock 2003). The input is assumed to be a review, so this task
does not include finding subjective documents in the first place. The first study listed
above (Turney 2002) uses a variation of the semantic similarity procedure presented
in Wiebe (2000) (Section 3.4). The third (Dave, Lawrence, and Pennock 2003) uses n-
gram features identified with a variation of the procedure presented in Wiebe, Wilson,
and Bell (2001) (Section 3.3). Tong (2001) addresses finding sentiment timelines, that
is, tracking sentiments over time in multiple documents. For clues of subjectivity, he
uses manually developed lexical rules, rather than automatically learning them from
corpora. Similarly, Gordon et al. (2003) use manually developed grammars to detect
some types of subjective language. Agrawal et al. (2003) partition newsgroup authors
into camps based on quotation links. They do not attempt to recognize subjective
language.
The most closely related new work is Riloff, Wiebe, and Wilson (2003), Riloff
and Wiebe (2003) and Yu and Hatzivassiloglou (2003). The first two focus on finding
additional types of subjective clues (nouns and extraction patterns identified using
extraction pattern bootstrapping). Yu and Hatzivassiloglou (2003) perform opinion text
classification. They also use existing WSJ document classes for training and testing,
but they do not include the entire corpus in their experiments, as we do. Their opinion
piece class consists only of editorials and letters to the editor, and their nonopinion
class consists only of business and news. They report an average F-measure of 96.5%.
Our result of 94% accuracy on document level classification is almost comparable.
They also perform sentence-level classification.
We anticipate that knowledge of subjective language may be usefully exploited in
a number of NLP application areas and hope that the work presented in this article will
encourage others to experiment with subjective language in their applications. More
generally, there are many types of artificial intelligence systems for which state-of-
affairs types such as beliefs and desires are central, including systems that perform plan
recognition for understanding narratives (Dyer 1982; Lehnert et al. 1983), for argument
understanding (Alvarado, Dyer, and Flowers 1986), for understanding stories from
different perspectives (Carbonell 1979), and for generating language under different
pragmatic constraints (Hovy 1987). Knowledge of linguistic subjectivity could enhance
the abilities of such systems to recognize and generate expressions referring to such
states of affairs in natural text.

summarization. This article has presented the results of an empirical study in ac-
quiring knowledge of subjective language from corpora in which a number of fea-
ture types were learned and evaluated on different types of data with positive re-
sults.
We showed that unique words are subjective more often than expected and that
unique words are valuable clues to subjectivity. We also presented a procedure for au-
tomatically identifying potentially subjective collocations, including fixed collocations
and collocations with placeholders for unique words. In addition, we used the results
of a method for clustering words according to distributional similarity (Lin 1998) to
identify adjectival and verbal clues of subjectivity.
Table 9 summarizes the results of testing all of the above types of PSEs. All show
increased precision in the evaluations. Together, they show consistency in performance.
In almost all cases they perform better or worse on the same data sets, despite the
fact that different kinds of data and procedures are used to learn them. In addition,
PSEs learned using expression-level subjective-element data have precisions higher
than baseline on document-level opinion piece data, and vice versa.
Having a large stable of PSEs, it was important to disambiguate whether or not
PSE instances are subjective in the contexts in which they appear. We discovered that
the density of other potentially subjective expressions in the surrounding context is
important. If a clue is surrounded by a sufficient number of other clues, then it is
more likely to be subjective than if there were not. Parameter values were selected
using training data manually annotated at the expression level for subjective elements
and then tested on data annotated at the document level for opinion pieces. All of
the selected parameters led to increases in precision on the test data, and most lead to
increases over 100%. Once again we found consistency between expression-level and
document-level annotations. PSE sets defined by density have high precision in both
the subjective-element data and the opinion piece data. The large differences between
training and testing suggest that our results are not brittle.
Using a density feature selected from a training set, sentences containing high-
density PSEs were extracted from a separate test set, and manually annotated by two
judges. Fully 93% of the sentences extracted were found to be subjective or to be near
subjective sentences. Admittedly, the chosen density feature is a high-precision, low-
frequency one. But since the process is fully automatic, the feature could be applied to
more unannotated text to identify regions containing subjective sentences. In addition,
because the precision and frequency of the density features are stable across data sets,
lower-precision but higher-frequency options are available.
Finally, the value of the various types of PSEs was demonstrated with the task
of opinion piece classification. Using the k-nearest-neighbor classification algorithm
with leave-one-out cross-validation, a classification accuracy of 94% was achieved on
a large test set, with a reduction in error of 28% from the baseline.
Future work is required to determine how to exploit density features to improve
the performance of text categorization algorithms. Another area of future work is
searching for clues to objectivity, such as the politeness features used by Spertus (1997).
Still another is identifying the type of a subjective expression (e.g., positive or neg-
ative evaluative), extending work such as Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1997) on
classifying lexemes to the classification of instances in context (compare, e.g., “great!”
and “oh great.”)
In addition, it would be illuminating to apply our system to data annotated with
discourse trees (Carlson, Marcu, and Okurowski 2001). We hypothesize that most ob-
jective sentences identified by our system are dominated in the discourse by subjective
sentences and that we are moving toward identifying subjective discourse segments.

<abstract confidence="0.970808076923077">Subjectivity in natural language refers to aspects of language used to express opinions, evaluations, and speculations. There are numerous natural language processing applications for which subjectivity analysis is relevant, including information extraction and text categorization. The goal of this work is learning subjective language from corpora. Clues of subjectivity are generated and tested, including low-frequency words, collocations, and adjectives and verbs identified using distributional similarity. The features are also examined working together in concert. The features, generated from different data sets using different procedures, exhibit consistency in performance in that they all do better and worse on the same data sets. In addition, this article shows that the density of subjectivity clues in the surrounding context strongly affects how likely it is that a word is subjective, and it provides the results of an annotation study assessing the subjectivity of sentences with high-density features. Finally, the clues are used to perform opinion piece recognition (a type of text categorization and genre detection) to demonstrate the utility of the knowledge acquired in this article.</abstract>

Introduction Subjectivity in natural language refers to aspects of language used to express opinions, evaluations, and speculations (Banfield 1982; Wiebe 1994). Many natural language processing (NLP) applications could benefit from being able to distinguish subjective language from language used to objectively present factual information. Current extraction and retrieval technology focuses almost exclusively on the subject matter of documents. However, additional aspects of a document influence its relevance, including evidential status and attitude (Kessler, Nunberg, Sch¨utze 1997). Information extraction systems should be able to distinguish between factual information (which should be extracted) and nonfactual information (which shou</context>

It was developed to support NLP research and combines ideas from several sources in fields outside NLP, especially linguistics and literary theory. The most direct influences on the model were Dolezel (1973) (types of subjectivity clues), Uspensky (1973) (types of point of view), Kuroda (1973, 1976) (pragmatics of point of view), Chatman (1978) (story versus discourse), Cohn (1978) (linguistic styles for presenting consciousness), Fodor (1979) (linguistic description of opaque contexts), and especially Banfield (1982) (theory of subjectivity versus communication).1 The remainder of this section sketches our conceptualization of subjectivity and describes the annotation projects it underlies. Subjective elements are linguistic expressions of private states in context. Subjective elements are often lexical (examples are stand in awe, unceasingly, fascinated in (3) and eroding, sapping, and complains in (5)). They may be single words (e.g., complains) or more complex expressions (e.g., stand in awe, what a NP). Purely syntactic or morphological devices may also be subjective elements (e.g., fronting, parallel</context>

In (4), the target is a tale; in (5), the target of Maher’s subjectivity is the cost of health care. Note our parenthetical above—“according to the writer”—concerning Maher’s subjectivity. Maher is not directly speaking to us but is being quoted by the writer. Thus, the source is a nested source, which we notate (writer, Maher); this represents the fact that the subjectivity is being attributed to Maher by the writer.

The positive results from the opinion piece classification show the usefulness of the various PSE features when used together. 5. Relation to Other Work There has been much work in other fields, including linguistics, literary theory, psychology, philosophy, and content analysis, involving subjective language. As mentioned in Section 2, the conceptualization underlying our manual annotations is based on work in literary theory and linguistics, most directly Dole˘zel (1973), Uspensky (1973), Kuroda (1973, 1976), Chatman (1978), Cohn (1978), Fodor (1979), and Banfield (1982). We also mentioned existing knowledge resources such as affective lexicons (General-Inquirer 2000; Heise 2000) and annotations in more general-purpose lexicons (e.g., the attitude adverb features in Comlex [Macleod, Grishman, and Meyers 1998]). Such knowledge may be used in future work to complement the work presented in this article, for example, to seed the distributional-similarity process described in Section 3.4.

For example, editorials contain objective sentences presenting facts supporting the writer’s argument, and reviews contain sentences objectively presenting facts about the product beign reviewed. Similarly, nonopinion pieces are not 100% objective. News reports present opinions and reactions to reported events (van Dijk 1988); they often contain segments starting with expressions such as critics claim and supporters argue. In addition, quoted-speech sentences in which individuals express their subjectivity are often included (Barzilay et al. 2000). For concreteness, let us consider WSJ-SE, which, recall, has been manually annotated at the sentence level. In WSJ-SE, 70% of the sentences in opinion pieces are subjective and 30% are objective. In nonopinion pieces, 44% of the sentences are subjective and only 56% are objective. Thus, while there is a higher concentration of subjective sentences in opinion versus nonopinion pieces, there are many subjective sentences in nonopinion pieces and objective sentences in opinion pieces.

We perform opinion piece recognition in order to assess the usefulness of the various features when used together. Other previous NLP research has used features similar to ours for other NLP tasks. Low-frequency words have been used as features in information extraction (Weeber, Vos, and Baayen 2000) and text categorization (Copeck et al. 2000). A number of researchers have worked on mining collocations from text to extend lexicographic resources for machine translation and word sense disambiguation (e.g., Smajda 1993; Lin 1999; Biber 1993). In Samuel, Carberry, and Vijay-Shanker’s (1998) work on identifying collocations for dialog-act recognition, a filter similar to ours was used to eliminate redundant n-gram features: n-grams were eliminated if they contained substrings with the same entropy score as or a better entropy score than the n-gram. 302 Wiebe, Wilson, Bruce, Bell, and Martin Learning Subjective Language While it is common in studies of collocations to omit low-frequency words and expressions from analysis, because they give rise to invalid or unrealistic statistical measures (Church and Hanks, 1990), we are able to </context>

More generally, there are many types of artificial intelligence systems for which state-ofaffairs types such as beliefs and desires are central, including systems that perform plan recognition for understanding narratives (Dyer 1982; Lehnert et al. 1983), for argument understanding (Alvarado, Dyer, and Flowers 1986), for understanding stories from different perspectives (Carbonell 1979), and for generating language under different pragmatic constraints (Hovy 1987).

In general, nearly any information-seeking system could benefit from knowledge of how opinionated a text is and whether or not the writer purports to objectively present factual material. To perform automatic subjectivity analysis, good clues must be found. A huge variety of words and phrases have subjective usages, and while some manually developed resources exist, such as dictionaries of affective language (General-Inquirer 2000; Heise 2000) and subjective features in general-purpose lexicons (e.g., the attitude adverb features in Comlex [Macleod, Grishman, and Meyers 1998]), there is no comprehensive dictionary of subjective language.

Future work is required to determine how to exploit density features to improve the performance of text categorization algorithms. Another area of future work is searching for clues to objectivity, such as the politeness features used by Spertus (1997). Still another is identifying the type of a subjective expression (e.g., positive or negative evaluative), extending work such as Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1997) on classifying lexemes to the classification of instances in context (compare, e.g., “great!” and “oh great.”) In addition, it would be illuminating to apply our system to data annotated with discourse trees (Carlson, Marcu, and Okurowski 2001).

She uses machine learning to select among manually developed features. In contrast, the focus in our work is on automatically identifying features from the data. A number of projects investigating genre detection include editorials as one of the targeted genres. For example, in Karlgren and Cutting (1994), editorials are one of fifteen categories, and in Kessler, Nunberg, and Sch¨utze (1997), editorials are one of six. Given the goal of these works to perform genre detection in general, they use low-level features that are not specific to editorials. Neither shows significant improvements for editorial recognition.

To further evaluate the quality of a set of PSEs, we also perform the following significance test. For a set of PSEs in a given data set, we test the significance of the difference between (1) the proportion of words in opinion pieces that are PSEs and (2) the proportion of words in nonopinion pieces that are PSEs, using the z-significance test for two proportions. Before we continue, there are a few more technical items to mention concerning the data preparation and experimental design: • All of the data sets are stemmed using Karp’s morphological analyzer (Karp et al. 1994) and part-of-speech tagged using Brill’s (1992) tagger. • When the opinion piece classifications are used for training, the existing classifications, assigned by the Wall Street Journal, are used. Thus, the processes using them as training data may be applied to more data to learn more clues, without requiring additional manual annotation. • When the opinion piece data are used for testing, the manually refined classifications (described at the end of Section 2.1) are used. • OP1 and OP2 together comprise eight treebank files.

It is most fully presented in Wiebe and Rapaport (1986, 1988, 1991) and Wiebe (1990, 1994). It was developed to support NLP research and combines ideas from several sources in fields outside NLP, especially linguistics and literary theory. The most direct influences on the model were Dolezel (1973) (types of subjectivity clues), Uspensky (1973) (types of point of view), Kuroda (1973, 1976) (pragmatics of point of view), Chatman (1978) (story versus discourse), Cohn (1978) (linguistic styles for presenting consciousness), Fodor (1979) (linguistic description of opaque contexts), and especially Banfield (1982) (theory of subjectivity versus communication).1 The remainder of this section sketches our conceptualization of subjectivity and describes the annotation projects it underlies.

In addition, we use distributional similarity to improve estimates of unseen events: A word is selected or discarded based on the precision of it together with its n most similar neighbors.

The annotators were instructed to mark a message as a flame if the main intention of the message is a personal attack and the message contains insulting or abusive language. After multiple rounds of training, three annotators independently annotated a fresh test set of 88 messages from NG-FE. The average pairwise percentage agreement is 92% and the average pairwise kappa value is 0.78. These results are comparable to those of Spertus (1997), who reports 98% agreement on noninflammatory messages and 64% agreement on inflammatory messages. Two of the annotators were then asked to identify the flame elements in the entire corpus NG-FE. Flame elements are the subset of subjective elements that are perceived to be inflammatory.

Because the document-level data are not annotated at the sentence level, sentence-level classification is not highlighted in this article. The new sentence annotation study to evaluate sentences with high-density features (Section 4.5) uses different data from WSJ-SE, because some of the features (n-grams and density parameters) were identified using WSJ-SE as training data. Other previous work in NLP has addressed related document-level classifications. Spertus (1997) developed a system for recognizing inflammatory messages. As mentioned earlier in the article, inflammatory language is a type of subjective language, so the task she addresses is closely related to ours. She uses machine learning to select among manually developed features. In contrast, the focus in our work is on automatically identifying features from the data. A number of projects investigating genre detection include editorials as one of the targeted genres. For example, in Karlgren and Cutting (1994), editorials are one of fifteen categories, and in Kessler, Nunberg, and Sch¨utze (1997)</context>

Future work is required to determine how to exploit density features to improve the performance of text categorization algorithms. Another area of future work is searching for clues to objectivity, such as the politeness features used by Spertus (1997). Still another is identifying the type of a subjective expression (e.g., positive or negative evaluative), extending work such as Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1997) on classifying lexemes to the classification of instances in context (compare, e.g., “great!” and “oh great.”) In addition, it would be illuminating to apply our system to data annotated with discourse trees (Carlson, Marcu, and Okurowski 2001).

Finally, the clues are used to perform opinion piece recognition (a type of text categorization and genre detection) to demonstrate the utility of the knowledge acquired in this article. 1. Introduction Subjectivity in natural language refers to aspects of language used to express opinions, evaluations, and speculations (Banfield 1982; Wiebe 1994). Many natural language processing (NLP) applications could benefit from being able to distinguish subjective language from language used to objectively present factual information. Current extraction and retrieval technology focuses almost exclusively on the subject matter of documents. However, additional aspects of a document influence its relevance, including evidential status and attitude (Kessler, Nunberg, Sch¨utze 1997). Information extraction systems should be able to distinguish between factual information (which should be extracted) and nonfactual information (which should be * Depar</context>

A subjective element is an instance of a potential subjective element, in a particular context, that is indeed subjective in that context (Wiebe 1994). In this article, we focus on learning lexical items that are associated with subjectivity (i.e., PSEs) and then using them in concert to disambiguate instances of them (i.e., to determine whether the instances are subjective elements). 2.1 Manual Annotations In our subjectivity annotation projects, we do not give the annotators lists of particular words and phrases to look for. Rather, we ask them to label sentences according to their interpretations in context. As a result, the annotators consider a large variety of expressions when performing annotations.

This consistency in performance suggests that the results are not brittle. 4.3 Choosing Density Parameters from Subjective-Element Data In Wiebe (1994), whether a PSE is interpreted to be subjective depends, in part, on how subjective the surrounding context is. We explore this idea in the current work, assessing whether PSEs are more likely to be subjective if they are surrounded by subjective elements. In particular, we experiment with a density feature to decide whether or not a PSE instance is subjective: If a sufficient number of subjective elements are nearby, then the PSE instance is considered to be subjective; otherwise, it is discarded. The density parameters are a window size W and a frequency threshold T. In this section, we expl</context>

A set of seed words begins the process. For each seed si, the precision of the set {si}UCi,n in the training data is calculated, where Ci,n is the set of n words most similar to si, according to Lin’s (1998) method. If the precision of {si} U Ci,n is greater than a threshold T, then the words in this set are retained as PSEs. If it is not, neither si nor the words in Ci,n are retained. The union of the retained sets will be denoted RT,n, that is, the union of all sets {si} U Ci,n with precision on the training set &gt; T. In Wiebe (2000), the seeds (the sis) were extracted from the subjective-element annotations in corpus WSJ-SE. Specifically, the seeds were the adjectives that appear at least once in a subjective element in WSJ-SE. In this article, the opinion piece corpus is used to move beyond the manual annotations and small corpus of the earlier work, and a much looser criterion is used to choose the initial seeds: All of the adjectives (verbs) in the training data are used.

Question-answering systems should distinguish between factual and speculative answers. Multi-perspective question answering aims to present multiple answers to the user based upon speculation or opinions derived from different sources (Carbonell 1979; Wiebe et al. 2003). Multidocument summarization systems should summarize different opinions and perspectives. Automatic subjectivity analysis would also be useful to perform flame recognition (Spertus 1997; Kaufer 2000), e-mail classification (Aone, Ramos-Santacruze, and Niehaus 2000), intellectual attribution in text (Teufel and Moens 2000), recognition of speaker role in radio broadcasts (Barzialy et al. 2000), review mining (Terveen et al. 1997), review classification (Turney 2002; Pang, Lee, and Vaithyanathan 2002), style in generation (Hovy 1987), and clustering documents by ideological point of view (Sack</context>

Despite such differences between annotators, the expression-level annotations proved very useful for exploring hypotheses and generating features, as described below. Since this article was written, a new annotation project has been completed. A 10,000-sentence corpus of English-language versions of world news articles has been annotated with detailed subjectivity information as part of a project investigating multiple-perspective question answering (Wiebe et al. 2003). These annotations are much more detailed than the annotations used in this article (including, for example, the source of each private state). The interannotator agreement scores for the new corpus are high and are improvements over the results of the studies described above (Wilson and Wiebe 2003). The current article uses existing document-level subjective classes, namely editorials, letters to the editor, Arts &amp; Leisure reviews, and Viewpoints in the Wall Street Journal. These are subjective classes in the sense that they are text categories for which subjectivity is a key aspect. We refe</context>

A single round of tagging was performed, with no communication between annotators. There are techniques for analyzing agreement when annotations involve segment boundaries (Litman and Passonneau 1995; Marcu, Romera, and Amorortu 1999), but our focus in this article is on words. Thus, our analyses are at the word level: Each word is classified as either appearing in a subjective element or not. Punctuation and numbers are excluded from the analyses. The kappa value for word agreement in this study is 0.42. Another two-level annotation project was performed in Wiebe et al. (2001), this time involving document-level and expression-level annotations of newsgroup data (NG-FE in Table 1). In that project, we were interested in annotating flames, inflammatory messages in newsgroups or listservs. Note that inflammatory language is a kind of subjective language. The annotators were instructed to mark a message as a flame if the main intention of the message is a personal attack and the message contains insulting or abusive language. After multiple rounds of training, three annotators independently annotated a fresh test set of 88 messages from NG-FE. The average pairwise per</context>

What distinguishes our work from work on subjectivity in other fields is that we focus on (1) automatically learning knowledge from corpora, (2) automatically 301 Computational Linguistics Volume 30, Number 3 performing contextual disambiguation, and (3) using knowledge of subjectivity in NLP applications. This article expands and integrates the work reported in Wiebe and Wilson (2002), Wiebe, Wilson, and Bell (2001), Wiebe et al. (2001) and Wiebe (2000). Previous work in NLP on the same or related tasks includes sentence-level and document-level subjectivity classifications. At the sentence level, Wiebe, Bruce, and O’Hara (1999) developed a machine learning system to classify sentences as subjective or objective. The accuracy of the system was more than 20 percentage points higher than a baseline accuracy. Five part-of-speech features, two lexical features, and a paragraph feature were used. These results suggested to us that there are clues to subjectivity that might be learned automatically from text and motivated the work</context>

(“Northwest Airlines Settles Rest of Suits,” Wall Street Journal, November 1, 1989) A particular model of linguistic subjectivity underlies the current and past research in this area by Wiebe and colleagues. It is most fully presented in Wiebe and Rapaport (1986, 1988, 1991) and Wiebe (1990, 1994). It was developed to support NLP research and combines ideas from several sources in fields outside NLP, especially linguistics and literary theory. The most direct influences on the model were Dolezel (1973) (types of subjectivity clues), Uspensky (1973) (types of point of view), Kuroda (1973, 1976) (pragmatics of point of view), Chatman (1978) (story versus discourse), Cohn (1978) (linguistic styles for presenting consciousness), Fodor (1979) (linguistic description of opaque contexts), and especially Banfield (1982) (theory of subjectivity versus communi</context>

Tong (2001) addresses finding sentiment timelines, that is, tracking sentiments over time in multiple documents. For clues of subjectivity, he uses manually developed lexical rules, rather than automatically learning them from corpora. Similarly, Gordon et al. (2003) use manually developed grammars to detect some types of subjective language. Agrawal et al. (2003) partition newsgroup authors into camps based on quotation links. They do not attempt to recognize subjective language. The most closely related new work is Riloff, Wiebe, and Wilson (2003), Riloff and Wiebe (2003) and Yu and Hatzivassiloglou (2003). The first two focus on finding additional types of subjective clues (nouns and extraction patterns identified using extraction pattern bootstrapping). Yu and Hatzivassiloglou (2003) perform opinion text classification. They also use existing WSJ document classes for training and testing, but they do not include the entire corpus in their experiments, as we do. Their opinion piece class consists only of editorials and letters to the editor, and their nonopinion class consists only of business and news. They report an average F-measure of 96.5%.
