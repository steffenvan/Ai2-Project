<bodyText confidence="0.999978545454545">
Digital preservation is an integral part of
the management of information and the
institutions in the cultural heritage sector
are seeking for ways to incorporate it into
their everyday practice. While there are
generic approaches to long-term preser-
vation, further research and development
work is needed to address any specifics
of the digital objects in the cultural heri-
tage domain. In this paper, we will take
two case studies of recent projects and
analyse to what extent the metadata ac-
companying digital objects contribute to
guarantee longevity. We summarize this
analysis in two scenarios for sustainabil-
ity of resources produced by small pro-
jects because compared to big institutions
their digital assets are facing a higher risk
not to be preserved properly. We also
identify processes where natural lan-
guage technologies could be of help to
make the preservation more efficient.

An evaluation made in August 2008 in a recent

tised and born-digital material...&amp;quot; It also pro-
vides a good practice example from the UK, the
Digital Preservation Coalition. Although this
British experience is given as an example of a
successful approach, the implementation of pres-
ervation in the current digital repositories in the
UK is far from being satisfactory. The recent
final report of the DRAI project (see Daisy Ab-
bott 2008) on UK-based digital repositories iden-
tified that &amp;quot;Of the 3,707collections aggregated,
only 737 (20%) had evidence of a preservation
policy, and of these the vast majority were from
within the Arts and Humanities Data Service
(AHDS) Collections Repository which, since
March 2008, is no longer funded, leaving only
6% of resources with ongoing policies for long
term preservation.&amp;quot;
Why the digital preservation which is recog-
nised to be of high importance, is still not im-
plemented widely? The Blue Ribbon Task Force
Report (2008) summarized five major obstacles
in building sustainable digital preservation pro-
grams: inadequacy of funding models to address
long-term access and preservation needs; confu-
sion and/or lack of alignment between stake-
holders, roles, and responsibilities with respect to
digital access and preservation; inadequate insti-
tutional, enterprise, and/or community incentives
to support the collaboration needed to reinforce
sustainable economic models; complacency that
current practices are good enough; and fear that
digital access and preservation is too big to take
on. While these address mostly stakeholder-
related issues, a recent report (DPE: 2007) re-
viewed the progress of digital preservation re-
search world-wide. It concludes that &amp;quot;The analy-

have yet to be resolved.&amp;quot; Automation in digital
preservation is one of the ten areas named by this
study as being in a need of accelerated research.
These two reports identify two key areas
which need attention: the organisational aspects
and the research. Any institution which currently
faces the preservation challenge has to make a
difficult choice under the circumstances of the
rapidly changing technological environment and
the lack of a generally recommended and effec-
tive solution.
However, the deeper reason why after two
decades of efforts digital preservation still has
not reached maturity, is the lack of consistent
theoretical foundation. In 2001, James Cheney et
al. articulated the need to develop a mathematical
theory for the area of information preservation.
Having such a theory should help to understand
better the object models and the basic transfor-
mations which need to be supported in a preser-
vation system; it will also be of great benefit to
automation because it would be much more clear
what processes can be automated. In addition, a
coherent theory would help to identify any gaps
in procedures or data flows and thus would con-
tribute to the implementation of systems which
behaviour could be consistently traced. However,
since this first suggestion that a theory of preser-
vation is needed, there has not been much pro-
gress in developing one. Even the identification
of the basic elements of a theory of preservation
is not a trivial task.
In addition to this methodological difficulty,
the variety of domains where digital preservation
is to be applied brings even more difficulties. It
is still not clear whether a universal `one-size-
fits-all&apos; solution could be used in all different
domains. For example, in the cultural heritage
domain which is considered in this paper there
are various curatorial situations with regard to
digital objects. Resources prepared by small pro-
jects are in more danger with regard to their lon-
gevity compared to resources of large institutions
if we consider that they are created but the life-
cycle for digital objects curation is not applied in
full. In this paper it is not our aim to investigate
what is the level of awareness and readiness of
the whole range of cultural heritage institutions
but we try to highlight what is the current state in
the digital preservation field and what issues
need to be addressed by projects in the cultural
heritage domain.
In 2002, the reference model for an open ar-
chival information system (OAIS) was published
and one year later adopted in the international
standard ISO 14721:2003, see (OAIS: 2003). It
provides a functional approach which is helpful
to understand and describe the processes in a
preservation system. However, the specification
of the minimum information which should ac-
company a digital object in order to guarantee its
accessibility, interpretability and usability in the
future, is not addressed in OAIS.
There are different ongoing attempts to build a
theory of preservation. Giorgos Flouris and Carlo
Meghini in 2007 again suggested basing such a
theory on firm mathematical foundations and
such an effort will be made within the CASPAR2
project. Paul Watry in 2007 presented the direc-
tions of future research of the SHAMAN3 project
which aims to study the context which guaran-
tees that the essential properties of digital objects
such as authenticity and integrity will be main-
tained over time. Reagan Moore and MacKenzie
Smith suggested in 2007 a practical approach,
which demonstrates how various requirements of
the preservation systems can be implemented as
sets of rules.
Attempts to find an approach to building a co-
herent theory of preservation should also reflect
the specific features of various subject domains.
In Section 2 of this paper, we introduce the
basic concepts of the ISO standard in the digital
preservation domain OAIS4. Then in Section 3
we discuss issues related to the use of metadata
for preservation in the cultural heritage domain.
We take two examples of resources under prepa-
ration in the TEXTE project5 and the KT-
DigiCult-BG6 project and suggest two scenarios
for preservation of the products of small projects.
In Section 4 we summarise the issues which need
further development in the cultural heritage sec-
tor in order to address better the issue of longev-
ity of the digital resources.

2 The Basic Standard in the Digital
Preservation Domain: OAIS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999957892857143">
In response to the increased need for the intro-
duction of common practices in assuring long
term digital preservation (DP) of digital objects,
the International Standards Organisation (ISO) in
the last decade developed a number of concep-
tual DP standards and also some technical guide-
lines. The most popular standard in the area is
ISO 14721:2003 (Space data and information
transfer systems — Open archival information
system — Reference model), widely known as
OAIS7.
It is a conceptual framework which presents
the main functional components and identifies
the basic data flows within a digital preservation
system. The development of OAIS8 arose from
the need for a model which would specify the
basic components of a system for long-term
preservation of digital objects and their relation-
ships with the `external world&apos;.
In Fig. 1, an OAIS is represented as a box
which is connected to other entities from the en-
vironment. These are Producers, Consumers,
and Management (OAIS is not suggesting what
roles could be defined within the archive). A
special class of Consumers is the Designated
Community. The Designated Community is the
set of Consumers who should be able to under-
stand the preserved information.&amp;quot;9

attention also should be paid to the concept of

ground knowledge of the designated community
is not trivial in this domain, especially in the
cases of creating scholarly resources.
This in fact opens a new essential issue related
to the dynamics of resources: while the resources
created by memory institutions such as libraries,
archives and museums are `static&apos; because they
represent the resources of the institutions, the
resources created by projects tend to be dynamic,
because they could be enriched and extended.
These resources usually do not cover a fixed set
of holdings but are oriented towards a specific
theme and after a core set of resources is avail-
able, more materials could be added at later
stages. Being familiar with the model will help
cultural heritage professionals to organize better
the digital objects&apos; lifecycle and take informed
decisions on the preservation aspects of their re-
sources.
In addition to the definition of these functional
entities, an OAIS information model explains the
data flows between the environment and the ar-
chive, and also within the functional components
of the archive.
Every act of submission of information to an
OAIS by a Producer, as well as the dissemination
of information to a Consumer, occurs either as a
single discrete transmission, or as a series of
transmissions. To describe the exchange of data,
OAIS defines the concept of an Information
Package as a &amp;quot;container&amp;quot; of two types of infor-
mation: Content Information (CI) and Preser-
vation Description Information (PDI). The
Content Information and PDI are viewed as be-
ing encapsulated and identifiable by the Packag-
ing Information (PI).
OAIS defines three specialised types of infor-
mation packages (IP), namely:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.963741">
• Archival Information Package (AIP): An
Information Package, consisting of the
Content Information and the associated
PDI, which is preserved within an OAIS.
• Dissemination Information Package (DIP):

<bodyText confidence="0.76792">
The Information Package, derived from
one or more AIPs, received by the Con-
sumer in response to a request to the
OAIS.

• Submission Information Package (SIP):

by the Producer to the OAIS for use in the
construction of one or more AIPs.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.6535725">
PDI is divided into four types of preservation
information called Provenance, Context, Refer-

ence, and Fixity. Provenance describes the source
of the Content Information; Context describes
how the CI relates to other information outside
the Information Package. Reference provides
identifiers, by which the CI may be uniquely
identified. Fixity provides a wrapper, which pro-
tects the CI from undocumented alteration. A key
point to note is that OAIS does not suggest any
specific metadata as instantiations of PDI; so that
there is no guidance on what constitutes a mini-
mum technical requirement in respect of repre-
senting and encoding PDI information within
corresponding PDI data bitstreams. The defini-
tion of a minimum required set of data should be
based on a study of what is required to assure a
reliable, consistent, and measurable specification
and implementation of a preservation system.
The consequences for the cultural heritage
domain is that currently there is no single and
uniformly accepted set of elements which guar-
antee the longevity of resources; but every single
institution and project should consider how to
structure the different types of archival packages
if it establishes and digital archive and also de-
cide what metadata need to be stored for preser-
vation purposes.
In OAIS the closest analogue to the high-level
notion of metadata can be found in the idea of
representation information while on the imple-
mentation level PDI provides the closest notion
to a particular instantiation of a set of metadata
elements.
Having a reference framework for long-term
digital preservation systems had an essential im-
pact on the development of a common profes-
sional understanding and vocabulary. It has had a
significant impact on the subsequent develop-
ment of standards and as a guide to the setting up
of preservation systems. Yet, the complexity of
the area allows for multiple interpretations of
how the framework should be implemented in
real life applications. This arguably gives rise to
a need to develop implementation guidelines and
also to adjust any practical solution to policy
frameworks.

<bodyText confidence="0.988168303571429">
There are two key issues which need to be con-
sidered vis-a-vis metadata and preservation.
1.What metadata are needed for preservation
purposes in the cultural heritage domain (be-
sides assuring a reliable preservation process,
they should help the designated communities
to understand the resources), and
2. How to preserve the metadata accompanying
existing digital objects. Since it is often the
case that cultural heritage resources have ex-
tensive metadata and there are multiple
schemes used, this issue also touches upon
understanding and use of present metadata
schemes in the future; this issue is very similar
to interoperability of metadata schemes but
considered as interoperability between now
and the future.
In the area of preservation metadata, the basic
concern, as stated by Brian Lavoie and Richard
Gartner, still seems to be the development of
preservation elements&apos; schemes (2005). How-
ever, presentation and interoperability issues are
not the only concern: preservation metadata, as
all other types of metadata are affected by the
metadata bottleneck11, a metaphor which indi-
cates that the human efforts needed to create
metadata can not cope with the pace of creation
of new digital resources.
Another disquieting example comes from a re-
cent evaluation of a German national digitisation
programme which reveals &amp;quot;insufficient metadata
practice, endangering the usage of the digital
documents, not to speak of their preservation:
33% of the objects had no metadata at all, 33%
bibliographic metadata only, 10% had both bib-
liographic and subject metadata (rest: no infor-
mation). Less than a third of the metadata was
digital. ,12
To suggest an OAIS-compliant preservation
metadata solution, in 2002 OCLC (Online Com-
puter Library Center, Inc.) and RLG (Research
Libraries Group) created a working group to ex-
plore how a consensus between different projects
and initiatives in the field of preservation meta-
data could be achieved. A body of recommended
metadata for digital preservation was developed
in the next years under the name PREMIS:
PREservation Metadata Implementation Strate-
gies (see PREMIS (2008)). The effort of OCLC
and RLG to define preservation metadata is a
major development in the digital preservation
field. However, it analyses only preservation
metadata related to the digital object itself. A
number of issues likely to appear in real imple-

2002.

mentation scenarios are not considered, for ex-
ample the preservation and re-use of descriptive
and other metadata which might have been sup-
plied with the digital object which is of special
importance in the cultural heritage domain. Such
metadata could be of help in generating preserva-
tion metadata, or could be later used for search.
Having all these in mind, preservation meta-
data area provides many challenges. What pres-
ervation metadata to use? What minimum set
needs to be supplied in order to guarantee a reli-
able preservation process? How to automate the
creation of preservation metadata? How to guar-
antee that the digital resources developed within
a particular project are accompanied by sufficient
preservation quality metadata? And how to guar-
antee interoperability between multiple existing
schemes? It is not easy for any organisation or
project to make decisions regarding the metadata
in this situation.
In the last years there were several metadata
schemes developed dedicated to long-term pres-
ervation. In the domain of cultural heritage insti-
tutions these new kind of metadata have to be
combined with existing descriptive metadata
based on the traditionally used catalogue sys-
tems. Amongst those we are The Metadata En-
coding and Transmission Standard13 (METS), a
container format for metadata and content files
maintained by the Library of Congress (USA);
and LMER (Long-term preservation Metadata
for Electronic Resources)14 developed by the
German National Library.
Currently, researchers come to the conclusion
that the practical preservation activities require to
combine several various metadata schemes to
achieve a reliable preservation process. For ex-
ample Angela Dappert and Markus Enders
(2008) present an example of integrating METS,
PREMIS, and MODS15 metadata in an OAIS-
compatible system which aims to ingest, store,
and preserve eJournals in the British Library.
They demonstrated that no single existing meta-
data schema accommodates the representation of
descriptive, preservation and structural metadata
necessary for such a system.

3.2 Two Examples
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.987528723404255">
3.2.1. The TEXTE Project Digital Resources
TEXTE is an ongoing project coordinated by
The Moore Institute in the National University of
Ireland, Galway. It combines four tasks which
aim to illustrate how the current computer-
enhanced editing tools can be used to produce
various types of high-quality scholarly editions
(mediaeval manuscripts; correspondence; a set of
journal issues and ephemera). The materials are
digitised and then transcribed and encoded using
the Guidelines of the Text Encoding Initiative16.
The resulting resources are highly annotated
scholarly editions, a combination of the original
texts with the scholarly findings.
All these resources are built using the same
guidelines for text encoding. This common
framework facilitates the development of the
digital objects especially with regard to their on-
line publication and visualisation and to the an-
notation of resources from the same historical
and cultural background.
From digital preservation point of view, there
are several issues which need to be taken into
account:
The TEI P5: Guidelines for Electronic Text
Encoding and Interchange17 are not suggesting
metadata elements to be used especially for pres-
ervation purposes. It is essential to have well-
formed &lt;TEI.Header&gt; and to document the prin-
ciples applied in the encoding of the text; these
are prepared as a part of the project documenta-
tion. But the &lt;TEI.Header&gt; currently does not
support elements which can help to trace the
digital object&apos;s authenticity, integrity and chain
of custody — these could be included as addi-
tions. But a difficulty for such projects is the lack
of guidance on the significant properties of digi-
tal objects which need to be supported.
Projects such as TEXTE developing textual
resources would benefit from clear guidance on
this matter; currently the project faces the need to
find its own solution. The final product of TEXT
will be a set of web resources but their inclusion
into repository is still under question; if this hap-
pens additional effort will be needed to define
SIPs and to transform currently available XML
files into SIPs.

<bodyText confidence="0.998762369565218">
On the other metadata-related issue, the lon-
gevity of specific metadata schemes applied in
the cultural heritage domain, the decision to use
a widespread encoding framework might be seen
as a guarantee of the future usability of re-
sources. This is based on the expectation that the
TEI will be continuously supported in the future.
3.2.2. The KT-DigiCult-BG Project Digital
Resources
The KT-DigiCult-BG project funded by the
Marie Curie programme of FP6 was recently fin-
ished (in 2008) and one of its outcomes was the
creation of the Digitisation Centre in the Institute
of Mathematics and Mathematics at the Bulgar-
ian Academy of Sciences (IMI-BAS). This cen-
tre digitised a substantial number of various
types of objects belonging to the Bulgarian cul-
tural and scientific heritage (see Table 2). One of
the issues the project faced was the organisation
and the long-term preservation of these objects.
These resources were not deeply annotated and
are intended for the most general type of users —
the citizens. In this case the metadata used in the
mix of archival materials, old printed books,
photographs and periodicals followed various
encodings and were not encoded like the meta-
data of the TEXTE project using the same
Guidelines.
This heterogeneity of approaches leads to a
different situation in the produced resources.
Currently the digitisation centre team is planning
to place all scientific resources into a repository
using DSpace18 which will enable the use of its
resources within the DRIVER19 project reposi-
tory.
Preservation-wise, these resources will be
transformed according to this larger initiative
requirements and the relevant SIP will be built.
In this scenario the preservation task with regard
to the digitised documents prepared for access in
PDF format stays with the repository while the
digitisation centre will take care for the physical
copying of the master files which are stored in
TIFF format. This is a mixed approach where
various bodies take care for the preservation of
clusters of digital resources.

sources. Under this scenario, the set of digital
resources is prepared as a stand-alone collection
and does not necessarily become a part of a digi-

</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.995740541666666">
1. Such projects need to pay special attention to
proper documentation of the decisions taken
on the encoding applied within the project —
this is not only substantial for sustainability,
but also for re-use of resources in the future
as demonstrated by Claire Warwick et al.
(2009). Documentation which refers to a
general standard like TEI or XML is not suf-
ficient because it does not guarantee future
understanding and interoperability.
2. A set of preservation metadata needs to be
supplied for every single digital object. This
is currently not a trivial requirement because
there is no common view on the structure of
preservation metadata. Again, the internal
project decisions need to be well-
documented.
3. The overall responsibility to document sig-
nificant properties of the digital objects
which will allow checking authenticity and
chain of custody stays with the project; it is
unlikely to expect that anyone in the future
will be able to fill in such gaps if they are
present.

4 Conclusions

<bodyText confidence="0.95461135">
Our presentation of digital preservation issues
and the specifics of cultural heritage domain pin-
points several issues which are essential for fu-
ture implementations:
1. The understanding of digital preservation
standards and models is essential to organise a
proper lifecycle management for the cultural
heritage resources; there are examples of solu-
tions applied in the large memory institutions20
but smaller projects and initiatives need to ad-
dress these issues when they develop their sus-
tainability plans.
2. Widely used metadata standards in the cultural
heritage domain, such as TEI, could offer bet-
ter guidance on metadata elements subset de-
signed especially to support long-term preser-
vation. TEI provides mechanisms for follow-

the Netherlands are examples of institutions which apply
successfully digital preservation solutions.

ing any changes in the digital object; it also
could be used to encode information related to
other copies made such as master or preserva-
tion copies and access or use copies; and pos-
sibly to record any processes applied to a re-
source, but this is not sufficient because it re-
flects the process of creation of an object but
this is not sufficient to claim authenticity of
this object. Currently there is no mechanism to
check the integrity and the chain of custody of
digital objects. However, TEI guidelines
should suggest how correctly to represent
these changes. For example Linda Cantara in
2005 suggested to form an AIP for the re-
sources of the Tibet Oral History Archive Pro-
ject especially for digital preservation pur-
poses; more examples are needed in order to
establish a good practices which could be in-
corporated in other cases.
3. OAIS does not suggest any specific metadata
as instantiations of preservation description in-
formation and in particular in the cultural heri-
tage domain there is no single and uniformly
accepted set of elements which guarantee the
longevity of resources; therefore it is neces-
sary to define what metadata need to be stored
for preservation purposes. We can not offer a
general solution to this problem because it re-
quires consensus of the communities of pro-
fessionals.
We also have presented two scenarios on digi-
tal preservation derived from case studies on two
EC-funded projects. This work shows that there
is definitely a current need to suggest good prac-
tices for such endeavours, because while the pro-
jects tackle the preservation issue, it is very diffi-
cult to find individual good models to guarantee
the longevity of resources.

<abstract confidence="0.9998">Digital preservation is an integral part of the management of information and the institutions in the cultural heritage sector are seeking for ways to incorporate it into their everyday practice. While there are generic approaches to long-term preservation, further research and development work is needed to address any specifics of the digital objects in the cultural heritage domain. In this paper, we will take two case studies of recent projects and analyse to what extent the metadata accompanying digital objects contribute to guarantee longevity. We summarize this analysis in two scenarios for sustainability of resources produced by small projects because compared to big institutions their digital assets are facing a higher risk not to be preserved properly. We also identify processes where natural language technologies could be of help to make the preservation more efficient.</abstract>

Scenario 1. Preparation of stand-alone resources. Under this scenario, the set of digital resources is prepared as a stand-alone collection and does not necessarily become a part of a digital repository. 1. Such projects need to pay special attention to proper documentation of the decisions taken on the encoding applied within the project — this is not only substantial for sustainability, but also for re-use of resources in the future as demonstrated by Claire Warwick et al. (2009). Documentation which refers to a general standard like TEI or XML is not sufficient because it does not guarantee future understanding and interoperability. 2. A set of preservation metadata needs to be supplied for every single digital object. This is currently not a trivial requirement because there is no common view on the structure of preservation metadata. Again, the internal project decisions need to be welldocumented. 3. The overall responsibility to document significant properties of the digital objects which will allow checking authenticity and chain of custody stays with the project</context>
