In summary, this book is an exciting record of work
in progress. It assumes too much background material
to be used as an introductory textbook, but it could be
used in a seminar course on knowledge representation,
either with supplementary lectures on logic and philos-
ophy or with programming exercises that show stu-
dents how to implement such networks. By presenting
fourteen systems in one volume, it invites detailed
comparisons that can help knowledge engineers select
the best features for their future designs.

&amp;quot;This book describes a computer program that
produces English discourse. The program is capable of
describing in a sequence of English sentences any
game of noughts and crosses (tic-tac-toe), whether
given or actually played with the program.&amp;quot; (From
the Preface.)
The game descriptions have several properties that
make them non-trivial. The entities of the game are
referred to by fairly natural English noun phrases,
making use of anaphora and standard constructions for
qualification (such as relative clauses), and taking
advantage of symmetry of the board. In many cases,
moves are described for their strategic value, and some
mistakes of the program&apos;s opponent are mentioned.
The following sentence produced by the program illus-
trates these properties. If you had blocked my line,
you would have threatened me, but you took the corner
adjacent to the one which you took first and so I won by
completing my line. This also illustrates that the pro-
gram uses connectors like and, but, so, and although, to
string clauses together in coherent discourse.
The grammatical theory used by the author is sys-
temic grammar, essentially the version developed by R.
A. Hudson in English Complex Sentences, North-
Holland, 1971. In this theory, a grammatical item
(such as a clause) is classified by an associated bundle
of features. Feature-realization rules determine a set
of functions (like SUBJECT) for constituents.
Structure-building rules manipulate functions, gather-
ing them into bundles, one for each constituent.
Function-realization rules associate feature bundles
with these function bundles, and the cycle continues,
down to the word level. On each level there is some
freedom of choice for the features of an item, but
there is a network of constraints on co-occurring fea-
tures called the system-network.
In Davey&apos;s adaptation, semantic representations are
carried along with the above sort of syntactic repre-
sentations, and &amp;quot;specialist&amp;quot; procedures are used to
determine features of grammatical items where there is
freedom left in the system-networks. The overall con-
trol, however, is not strictly top-down as in Hudson&apos;s
system described above. Sometimes specialist proce-
dures actually construct the English text for an item
before determining all of its features.
It is unfortunate that the book did not reach pub-
lished form earlier. The work was done in the period
1970-1973 as the author&apos;s thesis at Edinburgh Univer-
sity. A chapter devoted to A Review of Previous Sys-
tems essentially covers only what was published by
1972. The program does not take account of advances
made in systemic grammar since around 1972. Some
of the constructions made by the program seem less
direct than they should be, and this would be im-
proved in the light of later developments.
