ABS TRACT.One of the essential aspects is described
of an expert system (called LEXICOGRAPHER),
designed to supply the user with diverse information
about Russian words, including bibliographic informa-
tion concerning individual lexical entries. The lexical
database of the system contains semantic information
that cannot be elicited from the existing dictionaries.
The priority is given to semantic features influencing
lexical or grammatical co-occurrence restrictions. Pos-
sibilities are discussed of predicting selectional restric-
tions on the basis of semantic features of a word in the
lexicon.

1.LEXICAL DATABASE OF THE
SYSTEM
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992863755555556">
LEXICOGRAPHER is an expert system
designed, in the first place, for the purposes of natural
language processing. The work on the project is being
conducted by a group of researchers including
E.Bclorusova, S.Krylov, E.Rakhilina, M.Filipenko
c.a.; cf. Paducheva,Rakhilina 1989.
The system consists of tWo basic components:
— lexical database (LBD);
— bibliographical database (BBD).
LBD is a vocabulary presented in a machine
readable form and consisting of several domaines , as
in a usual relational database. The user may get
information about morphology, syntactic features,
semantic features, prosody and referential features of
individual lexical items. Among the semantic features
that arc included or must be included in the database
there are such features as: [ + Speech act verb], [ +Per-
formative verb], [ + Verb of motion], [+ Kinship term],
[ + Part of the body], [ + Person (as opposed to a
physical body)), [ + Parameter], etc., all in all —
several dozen features.
Programs now existing give the following options:
— marking the vocabulary by a feature presented
as a list of words;
— compiling lists of words possessing a common
feature or a set of features named;
— compiling lists of documents containing infor-
mation about the lexeme named, as well as about a
given feature or a set of features;
— compiling alphabetical lists of words and fea-
tures mentioned in the BBD; such lists may play, for
the user, the role of a catalog representing the running
state of the BBD.
In the BBD for every lexeme or semantic feature
all the documents arc mentioned that contain some
lexicographically useful information about that
lexeme or feature. In contradistinction to all the ex-
isting bibliographic catalogs, our BBD contains bibli-
ographic information about individual lexemes,
cf.Krylov 1989.
The vocabulary consists of some 12.500 words.
Morphological information is taken from the diction-
ary Zalizniak 1977.
As for syntactic and semantic information, usual-
ly it cannot be found in existing dictionaries.

2. SEMANTIC FEATURE ACCORDING
TO U.WEINREICH
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9874075625">
Semantic features are the main subject of the
present paper. The notion of semantic feature is
associated, in the first place, with the name of
U.Weinreich (1967), who proposed a useful distinc-
tion between a paradigmatic semantic feature (ap-
proximately as in componential analysis , cf.Bendix
1965) and a transfer feature. This distinction made it
possible to use the notion of semantic feature in a
broader sense than in transformational grammar
(TG) where semantic features are strictly opposed to
syntactic ones, namely, to selection features and to
features of strict categorization: in TO semantic fea-
tures do not take part in formulation of grammatical
rules.
In Weinreich&apos;s conception semantic feature ser-
ves several different purposes:
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.881763">
1) it is regarded as a basis of semantic agreement
(as in well known examples pretty girl vs. *pretty man;
a year ago vs. *a house ago; before breakfast vs. *before
John etc.);
</footnote>
<listItem confidence="0.89391575">
- 194 -
2) it explains deviant and metaphorical readings
(as in a grief ago, before the wall etc.);
3) it adds provisional semantic contents to a
potentially ambiguous word in order to impose
semantic agreement where strictly speaking (i.e.
under literal interpretation) there is none; thus, in
example (1), from BeiiHpeCtx 1981, p.159, the word
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.93329868">
house, with the inherent semantic feature [-Time],
acquires in the given context feature [ +Time] as a
transfer feature imposed by the governing verb occur;
as a result, the word house is interpreted as an event,
e.g., as an event of somebody&apos;s perception of a house
while passing by: (1) A red house occurred twice.
In example (2), from BetiHpefix 1981, p.159, the
word craft acquires the feature [ +Aircraft], as a trans-
fer feature imposed by the verb to fly:
(2) They flew the craft.
Thus, following Weinrcich, we divide semantic
features into two groups. Categorial feature of a word
(usually, of a noun) is understood as its own charac-
teristics, possibly, as a common property of its
referents; cf. such features as [ + Person] or [ 4- Place]
of the words man and house correspondingly. Tran-
sitive feature of a word (usually, of a predicate) is a
semantic condition imposed on one of the arguments
- namely, on the semantic necessity of its presence in
the utterance with the given word and on its categorial
features. Thus, verbs of emotional state, such as to
hope, possess the following transitive feature: their
subject (necessarily existent) has a categorial feature
+ Person]. Verbs of motion must have at least one
argument with the categorial feature [ + Place], etc.

3. SEMANTIC FEATURES IN SYSTEMS
OF NATURAL LANGUAGE
PROCESSING (NLP)
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99805825">
Semantic features belong to obviously significant
NLP resources having no equivalents in existing dic-
tionaries. The following problems of NLP may be
listed where semantic features are constantly made
use of:
1. Revealing predicate-argument relations in
parsing algorithms: categorial features of the argu-
ment should agree with the transitive feature
predicted for this argument by the predicate. As is
pointed out in AnpecHH ed al. 1989, p.261, &amp;quot;in many
cases adequate identification of a syntactic construc-
tion relies upon semantic agreement of words&amp;quot; Thus,
semantic features can make a substantial contribution
in syntactic parsing:12.. Disambiguation of a lexically
homonymous predicate-word: categorial feature of an
argument may help in choosing the right lexical mean-
ing of the predicate; cf.7(3) a.Oxita TOCTIIHRIOI
BbIXOBRT Ha tor;
b. FICT51 BbIXOBIIT Ha .ny,xatixy.
In (a) the word Eocritittno &apos;hotel&apos; has a categorial
feature [-Movable]; hence the stative meaning of the
verb BbIDCOBP11:1) &apos;go out&apos;. In (b) manbillIK &apos;boy&apos; has the
feature [ + Movable) and the verb BbIXOBIHTb has its
usual meaning of a verb of motion.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.991309620689655">
3. Disambiguation of a lexically homonymous
noun by addressing transfer features of the predicate.
Thus, semantic features are usable for disambiguation
of words in context.
4. Combinability of verbs with adverbials desig-
nating time, place, reason, purpose, instrument etc.,
always rely upon some sort of semantic concord, cf.
Paducheva, Rakhilina 1950. E.g., the adverbial of
purpose is only possible in the context of a verb
denoting controlled action and, consequently, having
an agent endowed with free will. If this condition is
not fulfilled, the adverbial of purpose sounds deviant
(cf. *gam 011JIBTli npoenta y BOBIIT0.7151 HINICIOTC5I B
npmaxe a6ottemeuTume KHVDKC4K1.1: the adverbial
of purpose is out of place here because }memo&apos;
npoaaxce does not denote an action). The time adver-
bials denoting exact time (Ilaptyttesa 1988a) are ex-
cluded, on semantic grounds, in the context of such
non-action verbs as 01103AnbtOTCraTb, 3BTS1HyTbC51
&lt;0 Aox.narte&gt;, COXpaliHMCS1 etc.
5. In the course of analysis of coordinate construc-
tions it is often necessary to carry out a transformation
opposite to conjunction reduction, and semantic
agreement is what gives a hint as to how this transfor-
mation is to be fulfilled.
6. Semantic features may be useful in the proce-
dure of revealing anaphoric relations in the text, cf.
example from Dahlgren, McDowell 1986: (4) The cat
did not drink the milk. It spilled.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998941333333333">
As the verb to spill presupposes a subject which
is a liquid, the pronoun may be unambiguously as-
sociated with the milk and not with the cat.
7. Transfer semantic features may be used to
distinguish texts allowing for literal interpretations
from deviant or metaphoric (as in the sea smiled).

4. SEMANTIC FEATURES AND
SELECTION RESTRICTIONS IN
LEXICON AND GRAMMAR
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992449047619048">
In early 60-ies semantic features were almost
unique theoretical instrument of semantic analysis. A
progress in semantic theory achieved in the 70-ies and
in the 80-ies (in the first place in works ofJu.Apresjan
(1974) and A.Wierzbicka (1972), connected in the
first place with semantic decomposition of lexical
meanings, drew the notion of semantic feature aside,
to a secondary and a more modest position. Semantic
features were regarded at best as a subsidiary means
in systems of NLP, cf. AnpecHH iinp. 1989. Now I
argue that the notion of semantic feature deserves a
more prominent place, even in the context of modern
intricate &amp;quot;garden variety&amp;quot; semantics.
The fact is that in many cases semantic features
can be interpreted as a label for one or more semantic
components in the semantic decomposition of a
lexeme.
I am inclined to think that it is the semantic
feature and not the syntactic one that plays the leading
role in regulating selection restrictions in lexicon and
grammar.
- 195 -
Anna Wierzbicka in her book &amp;quot;Semantics of
grammar&amp;quot; takes an ambitious task - to present all
selection restrictions in grammar as motivated by
some semantic features of words and constructions:
&amp;quot;grammatical distinctions arc motivated &lt; ...&gt; by
semantic distinctions&amp;quot; (Wierzbicka 1988, p3). While
not wholly agreeing with this thesis, we can add some
arguments in its favor. Here are several examples of
selection restrictions that are usually considered to be
purely syntactic, i.e. demanding lexical lists, and which
can be proved to be semantically motivated, namely,
motivated by some semantic component of a word or
of a grammatical construction.
EXAMPLE 1. In 3a.ni13HsiK, FlaAricoa 1987 a
semantic characterization was proposed for the class
of predicates allowing Ncg-Raising. Such Neg-Rais-
ing predicates as to believe &lt;that&gt; possess two
semantic features: I + Incompatibility of contraries]
(you cannot believe that P and simultaneously believe
that not-P, though, e.g., you can assume that P and
simultaneously assume that not-P) and [ + Excluded
neutrality] (I do not think that P is out of place in the
context when I never gave it a thought - whether P or
not-P).
EXAMPLE 2. In Apyriotioria 1988 it was shown
that Russian conjunctions tiTO &apos;that&apos; and Kai&lt; &apos;as&apos; obey
the followingrule of semantic distribution: tiTo is used
after verbs with the semantic component
&apos;know/believe&apos; (cf, similar considerations about
English that in Wierzbicka 1988) and icax - after words
with the component &apos;perceive&apos;, cf. $I nommo, 14TO mig
Tam xyna.nmcb and 51 110MHIO,KaK MN Tam xyria.nricb.
EXAMPLE 3. In flaapiena 1988b the semantic
invariant is revealed for the class of predicates capable
of introducing indirect question or its equivalent -
parameter word; cf. _I know why he arrived; I know
the reason of his arrival, on the one hand, and *11,
believe why he came,*.lbelieve the reason of his arrival
- on the other (this problem was stated in Vendler
1981). It is the semantic component &apos;X knows&apos; that is
responsible for this semantic option.

5. ON SEMANTIC INVARIANT OF THE
CLASS OF WORDS WITH GENITIVE
SUBJECT
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998234">
Our main object of attention in this paper is
theiconstruction with genitive subject in Russian :
OTBeTa He npmnao, Mopo3a He myacToyeTcsi,
KaTacTpockm He npon30M.110. Note that in some cases
nominative is also possible: OTsei tie nimune.n,

M0p03 He 4yBCTBOBa.TICSI.
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99981075">
In Apresjan 1985 it is claimed that the choice of
the case of the subject in this construction is deter-
mined by a syntactic feature of a verb, and that this
syntactic feature must be ascribed to the correspond-
ing group of verbs (cf. rip0H3OATH); verb forms -
mainly, passive forms (cf. Ha6/110AaTbC51,
qyBCTnoBaThCsr) or predicatives (cf. SHAH°, C/HAWHO)
in the dictionary. The list is supposed toOntain more
than two hundred items. These words, as Apresjan
believes, possess some semantic affinity, but this af-
finity is not sufficient for reliable prediction of the case
of the subject: the list of words is supposed to be the
only thing that is necessary and sufficient.
This thesis is demonstrated by the following dif-
ferences in syntactic behavior of semantically cognate
pairs of verbs:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.954584571428572">

We claim that different choice of the case of the
subject in these examples has a semantic explanation.
Verbs that can be used with genitive subject will be
called genitive verbs. Now we claim that the set of
genitive verbs (more precisely, the set of meanings
these verbs have when used with a genitive subject)
has a semantic invariant.
There are two semantic components, different
but cognate, such that at least one of them is always
present in every negative sentence with the genitive
subject construction. Correspondingly, there are two
semantic groups of genitive verbs. In group I genitive
subject in a negative sentence is explained by the fact
that the corresponding sentence without negation
contains a semantic component &apos;X exists&apos;,where X
stands for the referent of the subject NP (or &apos;X takes
place&apos; - if the subject NP does not denote any object
but rather a process or an event). An important
condition is that this essential component should have
- in the semantic representation of a sentence - the
status of an assertion or an implication (according to
Karttunen 1973): it must not have the status of a
presupposition. Now, if the semantic representation
of the non-negative sentence contains a proposition
of the form &apos;X exists&apos; and if this proposition does not
have the status of a presupposition of this sen-
tence,then under negation (of the whole sentence)
proposition &apos;X exists&apos; will be negated. It is exactly this
semantic component - negation of existence of X, -
that is &amp;quot;responsible&amp;quot;, in the 1-st group of genitive
verbs, for the genitive subject.
If the meaning of the verb does not predict un-
ambiguously whether the presupposition of existence
must or must not be present in the semantic repre-
sentation of a sentence then both genitive and
nomina/tive subjects are possible: negative sentences
with the nominative and with the genitive subject will
have different meanings:
(8) aq(OTseT npHuie.n) = Omer He npHuien (the
existence of the answer is presupposed);
13-.)(11pmuen crraer) = Gram He npnumo ( the
existence of the answer is not presupposed).
In examples (9)-(11), where only genitive subject
is possible in a negative sentence, proposition &apos;X
exists&apos; cannot have the status of presupposition - it is
always an implication; thus, the case of the subject is
genitive:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.345686857142857">

Nominative is only possible as an &amp;quot;aggressive&amp;quot;
stylistic variant corresponding to a newly born norm,
as in
(12) AOTOB0pCHHOCTb He /70CTIITHyTa
It is much better to say ,Lkor000peHHocTH He
AOCTHTHyTO.
In group II genitive subject is predicted by a
component &apos;X is present in the field of vision of an
observer&apos;. When negated, this component has the
following form: &apos;X is not present in the field of vision
of the observer&apos;. It is this component that is respon-
sible for the genitive subject in the second group of
genitive predicates.
On the contrary, Nominative case of the subject
in the context of verb of group H expresses the presup-
position that the object is present at the place men-
tioned, but is not accessible to perception:
(13) a.1(.11epeami oripoia) = ./1,epeatis1 He omoia.
61(BHAHa Aepestio) = AepenHH He 1114/7H0.
Semantic components responsible for the geni-
tive subject in group I and in group H are cognate. In
fact, proposition &apos;X is not present in the field of vision
of the observer&apos; often has a conversational implicature
- &apos;And I doubt whether X exists at all&apos;. In other words,
the absence of the object in the field of vision casts
doubt on the very fact of its existence. This implicature
impends itself if the subject can only occupy the place
that the speaker has in mind. Then if the subject is not
perceived in this place it does not exist at all, as in
Mopo3a He myBcTayercm. For persons who can oc-
cupy different places, the problem does not arise.

the speaker does not call in question the existence
of Masha.
Thus, our semantic invariant of the class of sen-
tences with a genitive subject makes it possible to
characterize semantically the class of genitive verbs;
moreover, this invariant makes it possible to state
conditions (on sentence structure) under which geni-
tive subject is excluded, inspite of the fact that the verb
belongs to the class of genitive verbs. Thus, we get
explanation of the role of such factors (mentioned in
Babby 1980) as
— animate vs. inanimate subject;
— referentiality vs. non-referentiality of the sub-

— topic-focus articulation of the implied non-
negative sentence;
— presence vs. absence of the observer.
To recapitulate, our example shows that there is,
though indirect, connection between selectional
restrictions and semantic features of the word, i.e.
semantic components of its semantic decomposition.

The lexical database of the system contains semantic information that cannot be elicited from the existing dictionaries. The priority is given to semantic features influencing lexical or grammatical co-occurrence restrictions. Possibilities are discussed of predicting selectional restrictions on the basis of semantic features of a word in the lexicon. 1.LEXICAL DATABASE OF THE SYSTEM LEXICOGRAPHER is an expert system designed, in the first place, for the purposes of natural language processing. The work on the project is being conducted by a group of researchers including E.Bclorusova, S.Krylov, E.Rakhilina, M.Filipenko c.a.; cf. Paducheva,Rakhilina 1989. The system consists of tWo basic components: — lexical database (LBD); — bibliographical database (BBD). LBD is a vocabulary presented in a machine readable form and consisting of several domaines , as in a usual relational database. The user may get information about morphology, syntactic features, semantic features, prosody and referential features of individual lexical items. Among the semantic features that arc included or must be included in the database there are such features as: [ + Speech act verb], [ +Performative verb], [ + Verb of motion], [+ Kinship term], [ + Part of the body], [ + Person (as opposed to a physical body)), [ + Parameter], etc., all in all — several dozen features. Programs now existing give the following options: — marking the vocabulary by a feature presented as a list of words; — compiling lists of words possessing a common feature or a set of features named; — compiling lists of documents containing information about the lexeme named, as well as about a given feature or a set of features; — compiling alphabetical lists of words and features mentioned in the BBD; such lists may play, for the user, the role of a catalog representing the running state of the BBD. In the BBD for every lexeme or semantic feature all the documents arc mentioned that contain some lexicographically useful information about that lexeme or feature. In contradistinction to all the existing bibliographic catalogs, our BBD contains bibliographic information about individual lexemes, cf.Krylov 1989. The vocabulary consists of some 12.500 words. Morphological information is taken from the dictionary Zalizniak 1977. As for syntactic and semantic information, usually it cannot be found in existing dictionaries. 2. SEMANTIC FEATURE ACCORDING TO U.WEINREICH Semantic features are the main subject of the present paper. The notion of semantic feature is associated, in the first place, with the name of U.Weinreich (1967), who proposed a useful distinction between a paradigmatic semantic feature (approximately as in componential analysis , cf.Bendix 1965) and a transfer feature. This distinction made it possible to use the notion of semantic feature in a broader sense than in transformational grammar (TG) where semantic features are strictly opposed to syntactic ones, namely, to selection features and to features of strict categorization: in TO semantic features do not take part in formulation of grammatical rules. In Weinreich&apos;s conception semantic feature serves several different purposes: 1) it is regarded as a basis of semantic agreement in well known examples girl man; year ago house ago; before breakfast vs. *before John etc.); - 194 - 2) it explains deviant and metaphorical readings in a ago, before the wall 3) it adds provisional semantic contents to a potentially ambiguous word in order to impose semantic agreement where strictly speaking (i.e. under literal interpretation) there is none; thus, in example (1), from BeiiHpeCtx 1981, p.159, the word house, with the inherent semantic feature [-Time], acquires in the given context feature [ +Time] as a transfer feature imposed by the governing verb occur; as a result, the word house is interpreted as an event, e.g., as an event of somebody&apos;s perception of a house while passing by: (1) A red house occurred twice. In example (2), from BetiHpefix 1981, p.159, the word craft acquires the feature [ +Aircraft], as a transfer feature imposed by the verb to fly: (2) They flew the craft. Thus, following Weinrcich, we divide semantic features into two groups. Categorial feature of a word (usually, of a noun) is understood as its own characteristics, possibly, as a common property of its referents; cf. such features as [ + Person] or [ 4- Place] of the words man and house correspondingly. Transitive feature of a word (usually, of a predicate) is a semantic condition imposed on one of the arguments namely, on the semantic necessity of its presence in the utterance with the given word and on its categorial features. Thus, verbs of emotional state, such as to hope,possess the following transitive feature: their subject (necessarily existent) has a categorial feature + Person]. Verbs of motion must have at least one argument with the categorial feature [ + Place], etc. 3. SEMANTIC FEATURES IN SYSTEMS OF NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) Semantic features belong to obviously significant NLP resources having no equivalents in existing dictionaries. The following problems of NLP may be listed where semantic features are constantly made use of: 1. Revealing predicate-argument relations in parsing algorithms: categorial features of the argument should agree with the transitive feature predicted for this argument by the predicate. As is pointed out in AnpecHH ed al. 1989, p.261, &amp;quot;in many cases adequate identification of a syntactic construction relies upon semantic agreement of words&amp;quot; Thus, semantic features can make a substantial contribution in syntactic parsing:12.. Disambiguation of a lexically categorial feature of an argument may help in choosing the right lexical meanof the predicate; cf.7(3) a.Oxita tor; BbIXOBIIT .ny,xatixy. In (a) the word Eocritittno &apos;hotel&apos; has a categorial feature [-Movable]; hence the stative meaning of the verb BbIDCOBP11:1) &apos;go out&apos;. In (b) manbillIK &apos;boy&apos; has the [ + Movable) and the verb BbIXOBIHTbhas its usual meaning of a verb of motion. Disambiguation of a homonymous noun by addressing transfer features of the predicate. Thus, semantic features are usable for disambiguation of words in context. 4. Combinability of verbs with adverbials designating time, place, reason, purpose, instrument etc., always rely upon some sort of semantic concord, cf. Paducheva, Rakhilina 1950. E.g., the adverbial of purpose is only possible in the context of a verb denoting controlled action and, consequently, having an agent endowed with free will. If this condition is not fulfilled, the adverbial of purpose sounds deviant *gam y HINICIOTC5I B a6ottemeuTume adverbial of purpose is out of place here because }memo&apos; npoaaxce does not denote an action). The time adverbials denoting exact time (Ilaptyttesa 1988a) are excluded, on semantic grounds, in the context of such verbs as 3BTS1HyTbC51 etc. 5. In the course of analysis of coordinate constructions it is often necessary to carry out a transformation opposite to conjunction reduction, and semantic agreement is what gives a hint as to how this transformation is to be fulfilled. 6. Semantic features may be useful in the procedure of revealing anaphoric relations in the text, cf. example from Dahlgren, McDowell 1986: (4) The cat did not drink the milk. It spilled. the verb to a subject which is a liquid, the pronoun may be unambiguously aswith not with cat. 7. Transfer semantic features may be used to distinguish texts allowing for literal interpretations deviant or metaphoric (as in sea smiled). SEMANTIC FEATURES SELECTION RESTRICTIONS IN LEXICON AND GRAMMAR In early 60-ies semantic features were almost unique theoretical instrument of semantic analysis. A progress in semantic theory achieved in the 70-ies and in the 80-ies (in the first place in works ofJu.Apresjan (1974) and A.Wierzbicka (1972), connected in the first place with semantic decomposition of lexical meanings, drew the notion of semantic feature aside, to a secondary and a more modest position. Semantic features were regarded at best as a subsidiary means in systems of NLP, cf. AnpecHH iinp. 1989. Now I argue that the notion of semantic feature deserves a more prominent place, even in the context of modern intricate &amp;quot;garden variety&amp;quot; semantics. The fact is that in many cases semantic features can be interpreted as a label for one or more semantic components in the semantic decomposition of a lexeme. inclined to think that it is the semantic feature and not the syntactic one that plays the leading role in regulating selection restrictions in lexicon and grammar. - 195 - Anna Wierzbicka in her book &amp;quot;Semantics of grammar&amp;quot; takes an ambitious task to present all selection restrictions in grammar as motivated by some semantic features of words and constructions: &amp;quot;grammatical distinctions arc motivated &lt; ...&gt; by semantic distinctions&amp;quot; (Wierzbicka 1988, p3). While not wholly agreeing with this thesis, we can add some arguments in its favor. Here are several examples of selection restrictions that are usually considered to be purely syntactic, i.e. demanding lexical lists, and which can be proved to be semantically motivated, namely, motivated by some semantic component of a word or of a grammatical construction. EXAMPLE 1. In 3a.ni13HsiK, FlaAricoa 1987 a semantic characterization was proposed for the class of predicates allowing Ncg-Raising. Such Neg-Raispredicates as believe &lt;that&gt; two features: I+ Incompatibility of contraries] cannot believe P and simultaneously not-P, though, e.g., you can P and simultaneously assume that not-P) and [ + Excluded not think that P is of place in the context when I never gave it a thought whether P or not-P). EXAMPLE 2. In Apyriotioria 1988 it was shown Russian conjunctions and Kai&lt; &apos;as&apos; obey the followingrule of semantic distribution: tiTo is used after verbs with the semantic component &apos;know/believe&apos; (cf, similar considerations about English that in Wierzbicka 1988) and icax after words the component &apos;perceive&apos;, cf. $I nommo, xyna.nmcb and MN xyria.nricb. EXAMPLE 3. In flaapiena 1988b the semantic invariant is revealed for the class of predicates capable of introducing indirect question or its equivalent word; cf. _I he arrived; the reason of his arrival, on the one hand, and *11, reason of his arrival on the other (this problem was stated in Vendler 1981). It is the semantic component &apos;X knows&apos; that is responsible for this semantic option. 5. ON SEMANTIC INVARIANT OF THE CLASS OF WORDS WITH GENITIVE SUBJECT Our main object of attention in this paper is theiconstruction with genitive subject in Russian : npmnao, Mopo3a He He npon30M.110. that in cases nominative is also possible: OTsei tie nimune.n, M0p03 He 4yBCTBOBa.TICSI. In Apresjan 1985 it is claimed that the choice of the case of the subject in this construction is determined by a syntactic feature of a verb, and that this syntactic feature must be ascribed to the correspondgroup of verbs (cf. forms passive forms (cf. or SHAH°, C/HAWHO) in the dictionary. The list is supposed toOntain more than two hundred items. These words, as Apresjan believes, possess some semantic affinity, but this affinity is not sufficient for reliable prediction of the case of the subject: the list of words is supposed to be the only thing that is necessary and sufficient. This thesis is demonstrated by the following differences in syntactic behavior of semantically cognate pairs of verbs: a. Ciapocrba Ha He 6b1U10; Ha co6pamm He nimicyrcraosano. a. B Texinmecxort nponaraH.obi He Hacrynmno B nponaramai He Halianoch. a. 6011e3H0 60J1e3HH He HCile3.110. We claim that different choice of the case of the subject in these examples has a semantic explanation. Verbs that can be used with genitive subject will be verbs. Now we claim that the set of genitive verbs (more precisely, the set of meanings these verbs have when used with a genitive subject) has a semantic invariant. are two components, different but cognate, such that at least one of them is always present in every negative sentence with the genitive subject construction. Correspondingly, there are two groups of genitive verbs. In group subject in a negative sentence is explained by the fact that the corresponding sentence without negation contains a semantic component &apos;X exists&apos;,where X stands for the referent of the subject NP (or &apos;X takes place&apos; if the subject NP does not denote any object but rather a process or an event). An important condition is that this essential component should have in the semantic representation of a sentence the of assertion or an implication (according to 1973): it must have status of a presupposition. Now, if the semantic representation of the non-negative sentence contains a proposition of the form &apos;X exists&apos; and if this proposition does not have the status of a presupposition of this sentence,then under negation (of the whole sentence) proposition &apos;X exists&apos; will be negated. It is exactly this semantic component negation of existence of X, that is &amp;quot;responsible&amp;quot;, in the 1-st group of genitive verbs, for the genitive subject. If the meaning of the verb does not predict unambiguously whether the presupposition of existence must or must not be present in the semantic repreof sentence then both genitive subjects possible: negative sentences with the nominative and with the genitive subject will have different meanings: (8) aq(OTseT npHuie.n) = Omer He npHuien (the of the answer is crraer) = Gram He npnumo ( the of the answer is not presupposed). In examples (9)-(11), where only genitive subject is possible in a negative sentence, proposition &apos;X exists&apos; cannot have the status of presupposition it is an implication; thus, the case the subject is genitive: (9) a. Ocamca He abina.noi - 196 - *OcaAox a. 3aTpyilHemin He *3aTpyaHem1si 803H1K.T114a. yodaTpHaaeTcsi; b. *Pamiu,a He ycmaTpithaeTcst. Nominative is only possible as an &amp;quot;aggressive&amp;quot; stylistic variant corresponding to a newly born norm, as in AOTOB0pCHHOCTb much better to say ,Lkor000peHHocTH He AOCTHTHyTO. In group II genitive subject is predicted by a component &apos;X is present in the field of vision of an observer&apos;. When negated, this component has the following form: &apos;X is not present in the field of vision of the observer&apos;. It is this component that is responsible for the genitive subject in the second group of genitive predicates. On the contrary, Nominative case of the subject in the context of verb of group H expresses the presupposition that the object is present at the place mentioned, but is not accessible to perception: (13) a.1(.11epeami oripoia) = ./1,epeatis1 He omoia. Aepestio) = AepenHH He Semantic components responsible for the genitive subject in group I and in group H are cognate. In fact, proposition &apos;X is not present in the field of vision of the observer&apos; often has a conversational implicature - &apos;And I doubt whether X exists at all&apos;. In other words, the absence of the object in the field of vision casts doubt on the very fact of its existence. This implicature impends itself if the subject can only occupy the place that the speaker has in mind. Then if the subject is not perceived in this place it does not exist at all, as in Mopo3a He myBcTayercm. For persons who can occupy different places, the problem does not arise. Thus when stating (14) Ma11114 HC BLIJAHO &lt;3,17eCb&gt; the speaker does not call in question the existence of Masha. Thus, our semantic invariant of the class of sentences with a genitive subject makes it possible to characterize semantically the class of genitive verbs; moreover, this invariant makes it possible to state conditions (on sentence structure) under which genitive subject is excluded, inspite of the fact that the verb belongs to the class of genitive verbs. Thus, we get explanation of the role of such factors (mentioned in Babby 1980) as — animate vs. inanimate subject; referentiality vs. non-referentiality of the subject; — topic-focus articulation of the implied nonnegative sentence; — presence vs. absence of the observer. To recapitulate, our example shows that there is, though indirect, connection between selectional restrictions and semantic features of the word, i.e. semantic components of its semantic decomposition.</abstract>
