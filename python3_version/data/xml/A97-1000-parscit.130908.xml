PREFACE

<bodyText confidence="0.999273219512195">
Little by little, we are learning how to do a better job in building natural language
analyzers and generators. Our tool kit is slowly growing — adding, in particular, in the
last few years, better tools for learning language patterns from corpora. Of course, our
tools are still quite primitive; when we look back at this time in later years we will be
amazed at how much we didn&apos;t understand about natural language.
But we are also learning to make better use of the tools we do have. We are coming to
a better appreciation of how relatively simple tools — morphological analyzers, name
recognizers, phrase parsers, to name a few — can be remarkably effective in particular
applications. And from this appreciation has flowed a steadily increasing stream of natural
language applications.
It is this growing stream that we come here this week to nurture and reflect on. The
Conferences on Applied Natural Language Processing are intended to highlight the ways in
which natural language processing can be applied to real tasks. With the help of the
program committee and other colleagues, we have made a particular effort this year to
broaden the range of applications which are presented. Conferences above all are about
exchanging ideas, and by stretching the range of the conference we hope to expose people
to problems, to techniques, and to applications they might not have seen before. We have
also provided an extensive program of demonstrations, ranging from early research
prototypes to more mature commercial systems; there is nothing like a live demo to
crystallize the problems and accomplishments in our field.
In running an applied conference we are faced forever with the question of what is an
&amp;quot;applied&amp;quot; paper. We have chosen to answer that question in an inclusive fashion, including
several sessions which address basic technologies such as morphology, parsing, and sense
disambiguation, which underlie many of our applications. As we build new applications,
we are aware of how shortcomings in these basic technologies affect our design, so it is
important to bring together people working on the technologies with those working on the
applications.
A conference like this brings together the NLP community not only at the conference
itself but also in the months before, soliciting and reviewing papers and planning the
sessions. I want to thank the program committee and all the reviewers enlisted for this
conference, who prepared reviews of exceptional care and detail; the presenters of the
tutorials, technical papers, and demonstrations, who have together prepared the panoply of
presentations of natural language processing which we are to savor this week; and John
White, the local arrangements chair, and his secretary, Juanita Caldwell, who — together
with Priscilla Rasmussen at the ACL office and Kathy McKeown, our secretary-treasurer
— planned and organized the conference itself. I want to especially thank John for bearing
the added burden of our greatly expanded program of demos this year. I want to
acknowledge Victoria Mason and John Sterling at NYU, who dealt with the problems of
preparing and printing the papers, and assembling the final proceedings, keeping
everything in good order and on schedule. And most of all I want to thank all the authors
who submitted papers and entrusted us with the fruit of their research.

In order to perform any sophisticated natural language processing task, it is necessary
to first discover the underlying linguistic structure of the input. Depending on the task, this
might include information such as parts of speech, word senses, phrase structure, different
types of names, etc. Recently a number of approaches have been developed for
automatically training programs to provide such annotations. We will survey these
approaches and discuss their advantages and disadvantages. The most accurate
automatically trained systems typically require large manually-annotated corpora for
training, thereby making them expensive to port across domains or languages for which
such corpora are not readily available. We will describe methods that allow rapid porting,
including: learning without an annotated corpus, adapting an already-trained program to a
new domain with minimal resources, and methods for combining human intuitions with
automatic acquisition.

Natural language generation systems produce understandable texts in English or other
human languages from some underlying non-linguistic representation of information. NLG
systems combine knowledge about language and the application domain to automatically
produce documents, reports, explanations, help messages, and other kinds of texts.
The late 1990s is an exciting time for applied NLG. 10 years ago NLG was purely a
research activity, but in 1997 there are several fielded NLG systems in everyday use, and
many more systems under development. In this tutorial, we will describe some of the
techniques that are being used to build practical working applications today; we will also
provide pointers to leading-edge research developments in the field. The material is based
around a popular architectural model of NLG that encompasses the three stages of text
planning, sentence planning and linguistic realisation. We will include a case study
showing how to construct an NLG system which produces textual meteorological
summaries from underlying numeric data sets.
The tutorial should be useful for managers, implementors, and researchers. For
managers, it will provide a broad overview of the field and what is possible today; for
implementors, it will provide a realistic assessment of available techniques; and for
researchers, it will highlight the issues that are important in current applied NLG projects.

Talking is a fundamental and ubiquitous mode of communication between humans. The
idea of extending speech to verbal interaction with machines has produced powerful icons,
such as Arthur Clark&apos;s Hal; Kit, the futuristic car; and StarTrek computers.
Researchers and developers have been designing speech recognition systems for almost
50 years, and the fruit of their labor is a growing number of diverse speech-controlled
systems, including speech-to-text dictation products, voice-activated dialing systems, and
telephone messaging tools.
The presentation addresses three major questions about speech recognition:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999940666666667">
• What is speech recognition?
• How does it work?
• What is it used for?
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.986396666666667">
Answers to these questions include examination of speaker modeling; vocabulary
creation, grammar, and input channels. The presentation will be accompanied by
videotaped examples of existing systems and products.

This tutorial will cover the what and the how of Information Extraction (IE) systems.
First we characterize the range of tasks usually intended for IE techniques, and then
describe the various approaches to implementing these techniques, discussing the
advantages and disadvantages of each. Most IE systems process texts in sequential steps
(&amp;quot;phases&amp;quot;) ranging from lexical and morphological processing, recognition and typing of
proper names, parsing of larger syntactic constituents, and resolution of anaphora and
coreference. Finally, IE systems have a domain phase that recognizes events and
relationships relevant to the specific IE task. We shall discuss various approaches to each
of these phases in turn, and examine their suitability for different types of IE problems. We
will discuss the problems and advantages of incorporating various external resources into
extraction systems, including large lexicons, gazetteers, and part-of-speech taggers, and
conclude with a discussion of template design principles that can have a significant impact
on the difficulty of the IE task.

<abstract confidence="0.987538833333333">PREFACE Little by little, we are learning how to do a better job in building natural language analyzers and generators. Our tool kit is slowly growing — adding, in particular, in the last few years, better tools for learning language patterns from corpora. Of course, our tools are still quite primitive; when we look back at this time in later years we will be amazed at how much we didn&apos;t understand about natural language. But we are also learning to make better use of the tools we do have. We are coming to a better appreciation of how relatively simple tools — morphological analyzers, name recognizers, phrase parsers, to name a few — can be remarkably effective in particular applications. And from this appreciation has flowed a steadily increasing stream of natural language applications. It is this growing stream that we come here this week to nurture and reflect on. The Conferences on Applied Natural Language Processing are intended to highlight the ways in which natural language processing can be applied to real tasks. With the help of the program committee and other colleagues, we have made a particular effort this year to broaden the range of applications which are presented. Conferences above all are about exchanging ideas, and by stretching the range of the conference we hope to expose people to problems, to techniques, and to applications they might not have seen before. We have also provided an extensive program of demonstrations, ranging from early research prototypes to more mature commercial systems; there is nothing like a live demo to crystallize the problems and accomplishments in our field. In running an applied conference we are faced forever with the question of what is an &amp;quot;applied&amp;quot; paper. We have chosen to answer that question in an inclusive fashion, including several sessions which address basic technologies such as morphology, parsing, and sense disambiguation, which underlie many of our applications. As we build new applications, we are aware of how shortcomings in these basic technologies affect our design, so it is important to bring together people working on the technologies with those working on the applications. A conference like this brings together the NLP community not only at the conference itself but also in the months before, soliciting and reviewing papers and planning the sessions. I want to thank the program committee and all the reviewers enlisted for this conference, who prepared reviews of exceptional care and detail; the presenters of the tutorials, technical papers, and demonstrations, who have together prepared the panoply of presentations of natural language processing which we are to savor this week; and John White, the local arrangements chair, and his secretary, Juanita Caldwell, who — together with Priscilla Rasmussen at the ACL office and Kathy McKeown, our secretary-treasurer — planned and organized the conference itself. I want to especially thank John for bearing the added burden of our greatly expanded program of demos this year. I want to acknowledge Victoria Mason and John Sterling at NYU, who dealt with the problems of preparing and printing the papers, and assembling the final proceedings, keeping everything in good order and on schedule. And most of all I want to thank all the authors who submitted papers and entrusted us with the fruit of their research.</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.994256416666667">In order to perform any sophisticated natural language processing task, it is necessary to first discover the underlying linguistic structure of the input. Depending on the task, this might include information such as parts of speech, word senses, phrase structure, different types of names, etc. Recently a number of approaches have been developed for automatically training programs to provide such annotations. We will survey these approaches and discuss their advantages and disadvantages. The most accurate automatically trained systems typically require large manually-annotated corpora for training, thereby making them expensive to port across domains or languages for which such corpora are not readily available. We will describe methods that allow rapid porting, including: learning without an annotated corpus, adapting an already-trained program to a new domain with minimal resources, and methods for combining human intuitions with automatic acquisition.</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.995470235294118">Natural language generation systems produce understandable texts in English or other human languages from some underlying non-linguistic representation of information. NLG systems combine knowledge about language and the application domain to automatically produce documents, reports, explanations, help messages, and other kinds of texts. The late 1990s is an exciting time for applied NLG. 10 years ago NLG was purely a research activity, but in 1997 there are several fielded NLG systems in everyday use, and many more systems under development. In this tutorial, we will describe some of the techniques that are being used to build practical working applications today; we will also provide pointers to leading-edge research developments in the field. The material is based around a popular architectural model of NLG that encompasses the three stages of text planning, sentence planning and linguistic realisation. We will include a case study showing how to construct an NLG system which produces textual meteorological summaries from underlying numeric data sets. The tutorial should be useful for managers, implementors, and researchers. For managers, it will provide a broad overview of the field and what is possible today; for implementors, it will provide a realistic assessment of available techniques; and for it will highlight the that are important in current applied NLG projects.</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.976948428571428">Talking is a fundamental and ubiquitous mode of communication between humans. The idea of extending speech to verbal interaction with machines has produced powerful icons, such as Arthur Clark&apos;s Hal; Kit, the futuristic car; and StarTrek computers. Researchers and developers have been designing speech recognition systems for almost 50 years, and the fruit of their labor is a growing number of diverse speech-controlled systems, including speech-to-text dictation products, voice-activated dialing systems, and telephone messaging tools. The presentation addresses three major questions about speech recognition: • What is speech recognition? • How does it work? • What is it used for? Answers to these questions include examination of speaker modeling; vocabulary creation, grammar, and input channels. The presentation will be accompanied by videotaped examples of existing systems and products.</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.994529214285714">This tutorial will cover the what and the how of Information Extraction (IE) systems. First we characterize the range of tasks usually intended for IE techniques, and then describe the various approaches to implementing these techniques, discussing the advantages and disadvantages of each. Most IE systems process texts in sequential steps (&amp;quot;phases&amp;quot;) ranging from lexical and morphological processing, recognition and typing of proper names, parsing of larger syntactic constituents, and resolution of anaphora and coreference. Finally, IE systems have a domain phase that recognizes events and relationships relevant to the specific IE task. We shall discuss various approaches to each of these phases in turn, and examine their suitability for different types of IE problems. We will discuss the problems and advantages of incorporating various external resources into extraction systems, including large lexicons, gazetteers, and part-of-speech taggers, and conclude with a discussion of template design principles that can have a significant impact the difficulty of the vi</abstract>
