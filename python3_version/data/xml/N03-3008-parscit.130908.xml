Topic detection and tracking approaches mon-
itor broadcast news in order to spot new, pre-
viously unreported events and to track the de-
velopment of the previously spotted ones. The
dynamical nature of the events makes the use of
state-of-the-art methods difficult. We present a
new topic definition that has potential to model
evolving events. We also discuss incorporat-
ing ontologies into the similarity measures of
the topics, and illustrate a dynamic hierarchy
that decreases the exhaustive computation per-
formed in the TDT process. This is mainly

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99997221875">
A fairly novel area of retrieval called topic detection and
tracking (TDT) attempts to design methods to automati-
cally (1) spot new, previously unreported events, and (2)
follow the progress ofthe previously spotted events (Allan
et al., 1998c; Yang et al., 1998).
Our contribution deals with three problems in TDT.
Firstly, we present a new definition for a topic that would
model the event evolution, i.e., the changing nature of a
topic. The previous event definitions do not really lend
themselves to this change. Secondly, we investigate an
approach suggested by Makkonen, Ahonen-Myka and
Salmenkivi (2002). They partitioned the termspace into
four semantic classes and represented each class with a
designated vector. Unlike the term-weighting model of
Yang et al. (2002) this approach enables the use of intro-
duction of different similarity measures for each semantic
class. We formalize the comparison method and suggest
aNN approach based on this formalization. Thirdly,
we suggest the use of dynamic hierarchies in a TDT sys-
tem that would decrease the exhaustive computation of
the first story detection. In practice this means that we
import text categorization on top of TDT. The purpose of
this paper is to outline the main aspects of our ongoing
and future work. As this is mainly work-in-progress, we
do not have empirical motivation for our work.
This paper is organized as follows: We will discuss the
problems of TDT in Section 2 In Section 3 we examine
the definitions of an event and a topic. Section 4 presents
a novel event representation and an approach to measure
the similarity of such elements. In Section 5 we deal with
dynamic hierarchies. In Section 6 we discuss our conclu-
sions.

2 Problems in TDT
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995616031746032">
The events are taking place in the world, and some of
them are reported in the news. A TDT system does not
perceive the events themselves, rather makes an effort in
deducing them from the continuous news-stream – which
is in a sense like the shadows on the wall in Plato’s cave
analogy. Given this setting, what is it that we are trying
to model?
Typically, the text categorization is conducted us-
ing some machine learning system (Sebastiani, 2002;
Yang and Liu, 1999). Such system is taught to rec-
ognize the difference between two or more predefined
classes or categories by providing a good number of
pre-labeled samples to learn from. As to classes and
word frequencies, this training material is assumed to
lend itself to the same underlying distribution as the
material that is to be categorized. More formally,
the documents and their labels
yield to a unknown distribution.
This distribution is expressed as a function that assigns
to each document-label pair
a boolean value indicating their relevance, i.e.,
The task of classification is to come up
with a hypothesis that represents
, practically, with the ’highest’ accuracy. This accuracy
is evaluated with a pre-labeled testing material.
Now, with TDT the problem is different. Let us assume
that the documents and events yield to an unknown distri-
bution represented by the function
that assigns each document a boolean value in-
dicating whether it discussed event or not. The
problem is that domain of is time-
dependent. The hypothesis built
from the training data does not work with evaluation
data, because these two data sets do not discuss the same
events. Moreover, the events are very small in size com-
pared to categories and their identity, that is, the most im-
portant terms evolve over time. We can, however, model
similarity between two documents. By examining the
pair-wise comparisons in the training set, we can formu-
late a hypothesis that assigns
the pair a boolean value 1 if the doc-
uments discuss the same event, -1 otherwise. Any two
documents of same event are (ideally) similar in a similar
way. This somewhat trivial observation has some impli-
cations worth mentioning.
Firstly, by definition news documents report changes,
something new with respect to what is already known.
This would lead to think that the identity of an event
eludes all static representations and that the representa-
tion for a topic would have to adapt automatically to the
various changes in the reporting of the event.
Secondly, so far the parameters and thresholds of the
state-of-the-art methods in IR have tried to capture this
similarity of similarity, but there does not seem be a rep-
resentation expressive enough (Allan et al., 2000).
Thirdly, the detection and tracking is based on pair-
wise comparisons which requires exhaustive computa-
tion. Yang et al. (2002) suggested topic-categories that
could be used to limit the search space of the first-story
detection. However, building topic-categories automati-
cally is difficult. In the following we outline some sug-
gestions to these problems: event modeling, event repre-
sentation and decreasing the computational cost.

3 Events and Topics
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9963735">
Although the concept of event might seem intuitively
clear and self-explanatory, formulating a sound definition
appears to be difficult. Predating TDT research, numer-
ous historians and researchers of political science have
wrestled with the definitions (Falk, 1989; Gerner et al.,
1994). What seems to be somewhat agreed upon is that
an event is some sort of activity conducted by some agent
and taking place somewhere at some time.
</bodyText>
<construct confidence="0.611027">
Definition 1 An event is something that happens at some
specific time and place (Yang et al., 1999).
</construct>
<bodyText confidence="0.999876777777778">
This initial definition was adopted to TDT project
and it is intuitively quite sound. Practically all of the
events of the TDT test set yield to the temporal proxim-
ity (“burstiness”) and the compactness. However, there
is also a number of problematic cases which this def-
inition seems to neglect: events which either have a
long-lasting nature (Intifada, Kosovo–Macedonia, strug-
gle in Columbia), escalate to several large-scale threads
or campaigns (September 11), or are not tightly spatio-
temporally constrained (BSE-epidemics).
The events in the world are not as autonomous as this
definition assumes. They are often interrelated and do
not necessarily decay within weeks or a few months.
Some of these problematic events would classify as ac-
tivities (Papka, 1999), but when encountering a piece of
news, we do not know a priori whether it is a short term
event or long term activity, a start for a complex chain of
events or just a simple incident.
</bodyText>
<construct confidence="0.916153">
Definition 2 An event is a specific thing that happens at
a specific time and place along with all necessary pre-
conditions and unavoidable consequences (Cieri et al.,
2002).
</construct>
<bodyText confidence="0.991157333333333">
This is basically a variant of Definition 1 that in some
sense tries to address the autonomy assumption. Yet, it
opens a number of questions as to what are the necessary
preconditions for certain event, an oil crisis, for exam-
ple. What are the necessary preconditions and unavoid-
able consequences of Secretary Powell’s visit to Middle
East or of suicide-bombing in Ramallah?
Definition 3 A topic is an event or an activity, along with
all related events and activities (Cieri et al., 2002).
Here, Cieri et al. explicate the connection between a
topic and an event: they are more or less synonyms. Rules
of interpretation that have been issued to help to draw the
line and to attain consistency. In TDT, there are eleven
topic types that tell what kind of other topic types are
relevant. The topic type of the topic is determined by
the seminal event. Since TDT2 and TDT3 corpora are
produced along this guideline, this is in a sense the de
facto definition.
</bodyText>
<construct confidence="0.496122">
Definition 4 A topic is a series of events, a narrative that
evolves and may fork into several distinct topics.
</construct>
<bodyText confidence="0.999825565217391">
Definition 4 makes an attempt at addressing the chang-
ing or evolving nature of a topic. A seminal event can
lead to several things at the same time and the connec-
tion between the various outcomes and the initial cause
become less and less obvious as the events progress. As
a practical consequence, the event evolution (Yang et al.,
1999; Papka, 1999) causes changes in the vocabulary, es-
pecially in the crucial, identifying terms.
The news documents are temporally linearly ordered,
and the news stories can be said to form series of different
lengths. Identifying these chains as topics is motivated by
Falk’s investigations on historical events (Falk, 1989). A
narrative begins as soon as the first story is encountered.
Then the narrative is developed into one or more direc-
tions: simple events, like plane accidents might not have
as many sub-plots as a political scandal, a war or econom-
ical crises. Then, at some point one could say the latest
story is so different from the initial one that it is consid-
ered a first story for a new event. However, there could
remain some sort of link that these two topics (narratives)
are somehow relevant. Hence, this kind of a narrative has
a beginning, a middle and an end. An event evolution is
illustrated in Figure 1.

Initially, in phase we have only one document, a first
story , an it constitutes an event that is depicted by the
dashed line. Then in phase, document is found rel-
evant to this event. Since it is found similar to , there
is link in between them. In phase there are two more
relevant documents: and . The former is more found
similar to than to , and thus it continues the off-spring
started by . On the contrary, appears closer to and
thus it starts a new direction. Phase shows two sto-
ries, and outside the dashed ellipse. This
represents a situation, where the vocabulary of the two
expulsed documents is diverging from the rest of the doc-
uments, i.e., the inner cohesion of the topic is violated
too much. The dotted ellipse represents the domain of
possible topical shifts, i.e., stories that lead too far from
the original topic. They are still regarded as part of the
topic, but are on the brink of diverging from the topic and
hence candidates for new first stories or seminal events.
Finally, in phase the separation takes place: Three new
documents, , and , are found similar
to . As a result, document is separated into
its own topic. Note that there is no follow-ups for ,
and therefore it is not cut off.
The problem of text summarization is similar to detect-
ing topical shifts: traces of all the main topics occurring
in the given text need to be retained in the summariza-
tion. On the other hand, text segmentation shares some
qualities with the topic shift detection. Lexical cohe-
sion (Boguraev and Neff, 2000) has been employed in the
task as well as in text segmentation (Stokes et al., 2002).
A model of Definition 4 has many open issues. For
example, what is the topic representation and what kind
of impact will there be on the evaluation? We will try to
address the former question in the following.

4 Multi-vector Event Model
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999989733333333">
It has been difficult to detect two distinct train accidents
or bombings as different events (Allan et al., 1998a).
The terms occurring in the two documents are so sim-
ilar that the term-space or the weighting-scheme in use
fails to represent the required very delicate distinction.
Furthermore, Allan, Lavrenko and Papka suspect that
only a small number of terms is adequate to make the
distinction between different news events (Allan et al.,
1998b). Intuitively, when reporting two different train
accidents, it would seem that the location and the time,
possibly some names of people, are the terms that make
up the difference. Papka observes that when increasing
the weights of noun phrases and dates the classification
accuracy improves and when decreasing them, the accu-
racy declines (Papka, 1999).

4.1 Event Vector
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99993196">
A news document reporting an event states at the very
barest what happened, where it happened, when it hap-
pened, and who was involved. The automatic extraction
of these facts for natural language understanding is quite
troublesome and time-consuming, and could still perform
poorly. Previous detection and tracking approaches have
tried to encapsulate these facts in a single vector. In or-
der to attain the delicate distinctions mentioned above, to
avoid the problems with the term-space maintenance and
still maintain robustness, we assign each of the questions
a semantic class, i.e., i.e. groups of semantically related
words, similarly to approach suggest by Makkonen et al.
(2002). The semantic class of LOCATIONS contains all
the places mentioned in the document, and thus gives an
idea, where the event took place. Similarly, TEMPORALS,
i.e., the temporal expressions name an object, that is, a
point or an interval of time, and bind the document onto
the time-axis. NAMES are proper noun phrases that rep-
resent the people or organizations involved in the news
story. What happened is represented by ’normal’ words
which we call TERMS.
This approach has an impact on the document and the
event representations. Instead of having just one vector,
we issue four sub-vectors – one for each semantic class
as illustrated in Figure 2.

One could claim that the meaning of a word is in the
word’s relation to other words without getting too deep
into philosophical discussions as to what and how the
meaning is. This meaning, that is, relation, can be repre-
sented in an ontology, where similar terms relate to each
other in different manner than dissimilar ones.
The similarity of event vectors is determined class-
wise: Each semantic class has its own similarity measure,
and the over-all similarity could be the weighted sum of
these measures, for example. The interesting thing is that
now we can introduce semantics into the vector-based
similarity by mapping the terms of a semantic class onto a
formal space. Each pair of terms in this space has a sim-
ilarity, i.e., a distance. Two TEMPORAL terms relate to
each other on the time-axis, and the similarity of two LO-
CATION terms can be based on a geographical proximity
represented in an ontology. For example, the utterances
next week and the last week of March 2003 do not coin-
cide on the surface, but when evaluated with respect to the
utterance time, the expressions refer to the same tempo-
ral interval. Similarly, London and Thames can be found
relevant based on an spatial ontology. Similarity in these
ontologies could be a distance on the time-axis or a dis-
tance in a tree, as we have previously noted (Makkonen
et al., 2003).
Now, let us present the above discussion more for-
mally. Each term in the document is a member of exactly
one semantic class. Hence, the documents are composed
of the union of semantic classes, or equivalently, the doc-
ument is a structure of a language specified by the unary
relations that represent the semantic classes.

be a language consisting of unary relations

Now, consider as the set of natural language terms
and as the set of semantic classes. A document repre-
This type of similarity we call the similarity of hands 1.
Hence, the similarity of two documents, and ,
would be a vector . There are
many ways to go about turning the vector into a single
score (Makkonen et al., 2002). One way is to define the
similarity as a weighted sum of each value of , i.e.,
(2)
where is the relative weight of class . The sim-
ilarities have also been interpreted as van Ri-
jsbergen’s (van Rijsbergen, 1980) similarity coefficients.
Unlike detective stories, news documents give away
the plot in the first few sentences. Therefore, the simi-
larity measure could exploit the ranking, the ordinal of
the sentence in which the term appears, in weighting the
class-wise similarity.The rank-score of a term occurring
times is

class. In other words, we find the nearest events with
respect to TEMPORAL, nearest events with respect to
NAMES, etc. In a sense, each semantic class votes for
candidates based on the relevance score and the respec-
tive weight of the semantic class. Once we have the four
sets of candidates, we elect the one with highest number
of votes.
Hence, let be the set of
previous -structures (i.e., events). The function
returns vectors of -
structures of length consisting of structures closest to
with respect to relation . In other words,
new topics are detected. There is also a time-window
to limit the temporal scope. Once a topic expires, it is
removed from the dynamic hierarchy and archived to a
news repository of lower operational priority.
The use of static hierarchy has some of the benefits
the topic-categories of Yang et al. (2002) had. It de-
creases the search space and enables a category-specific
weighting-scheme for terms. For example, when a docu-
ment is categorized to the class ’science’, there is no need
to compare it against the events of any other class; ideally,
all the relevant events have also been categorized to the
same class.

Quite obviously, the intersection is too strong a func-

5 Dynamic Hierarchies
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998302">
One of the problems that plagues many TDT efforts is the
need to compare each incoming document with all the
preceding documents. Even if we issue a time-window
and have a straight-forward similarity measure, the num-
ber of required comparisons increases drastically as new
documents come in. There have been efforts to decrease
the amount of work by centroid vectors (Yang et al.,
2000), and by building an ad hoc classifier for each topic-
category (Yang et al., 2002), for example.
We suggest the we adopt text categorization on top
of topic detection and tracking, similar to Figure 3.
There has been good results in text categorization (see,
e.g., (Yang and Liu, 1999; Sebastiani, 2002)) The pre-
defined categories would form the static hierarchy – the
IPTC Subject Reference System 2, for example – on top
of all event-based information organization, and the mod-
els for the categories could be built on the basis of the test
set.
Below the static hierarchy there would be a dynamic
hierarchy that evolves as new documents come in and

We have discussed three problems relating to TDT and
mainly its event evolution. The novel topic definition al-
lows the topic to evolve into several directions and ul-
timately to distinguish new topics. A semantic class-
based event vector enables harnessing of domain spe-
cific ontologies, such as the time-axis and the geographic
distances. Finally, we presented a TDT system with
dynamic hierarchies that would cut down the excessive
computation required in the TDT process.
Our previous results were done with a Finnish online
news corpus smaller than the TDT corpora (Makkonen et
al., 2002). The use of semantic classes proved to be ben-
eficial. We have also built a temporal expression scheme
and a geographical ontology for TDT purposes (Makko-
nen et al., 2003). In this paper, all our discussions were
preliminary and should be regarded as such. In the future
we will work to motivate these mostly intuitive theories
with empirical results.

Firstly, by definition news documents report changes, something new with respect to what is already known. This would lead to think that the identity of an event eludes all static representations and that the representation for a topic would have to adapt automatically to the various changes in the reporting of the event. Secondly, so far the parameters and thresholds of the state-of-the-art methods in IR have tried to capture this similarity of similarity, but there does not seem be a representation expressive enough (Allan et al., 2000). Thirdly, the detection and tracking is based on pairwise comparisons which requires exhaustive computation. Yang et al. (2002) suggested topic-categories that could be used to limit the search space of the first-story detection. However, building topic-categories automatically is difficult. In the following we outline some suggestions to these problems: event modeling, event representation and decreasing the computational cost. 3 Events and Topics Although the concept of event might seem intuitively clear and self-explanatory, formulating a sound definition appears to be difficult.

They are often interrelated and do not necessarily decay within weeks or a few months. Some of these problematic events would classify as activities (Papka, 1999), but when encountering a piece of news, we do not know a priori whether it is a short term event or long term activity, a start for a complex chain of events or just a simple incident. Definition 2 An event is a specific thing that happens at a specific time and place along with all necessary preconditions and unavoidable consequences (Cieri et al., 2002). This is basically a variant of Definition 1 that in some sense tries to address the autonomy assumption. Yet, it opens a number of questions as to what are the necessary preconditions for certain event, an oil crisis, for example. What are the necessary preconditions and unavoidable consequences of Secretary Powell’s visit to Middle East or of suicide-bombing in Ramallah?

A seminal event can lead to several things at the same time and the connection between the various outcomes and the initial cause become less and less obvious as the events progress. As a practical consequence, the event evolution (Yang et al., 1999; Papka, 1999) causes changes in the vocabulary, especially in the crucial, identifying terms. The news documents are temporally linearly ordered, and the news stories can be said to form series of different lengths. Identifying these chains as topics is motivated by Falk’s investigations on historical events (Falk, 1989). A narrative begins as soon as the first story is encountered. Then the narrative is developed into one or more directions: simple events, like plane accidents might not have as many sub-plots as a political scandal, a war or economical crises. Then, at some point one could say the latest story is so different from the initial one that it is considered a first story for a new event. However, there could remain some sort of link that these two topics (narratives) are somehow relevant. Hence, this kind of a narrative has a beginning, a middle and an end.

The automatic extraction of these facts for natural language understanding is quite troublesome and time-consuming, and could still perform poorly. Previous detection and tracking approaches have tried to encapsulate these facts in a single vector. In order to attain the delicate distinctions mentioned above, to avoid the problems with the term-space maintenance and still maintain robustness, we assign each of the questions a semantic class, i.e., i.e. groups of semantically related words, similarly to approach suggest by Makkonen et al. (2002). The semantic class of LOCATIONS contains all the places mentioned in the document, and thus gives an idea, where the event took place. Similarly, TEMPORALS, i.e., the temporal expressions name an object, that is, a point or an interval of time, and bind the document onto the time-axis. NAMES are proper noun phrases that represent the people or organizations involved in the news story. What happened is represented by ’normal’ words which we call TERMS.

One way is to define the similarity as a weighted sum of each value of , i.e., (2) where is the relative weight of class . The similarities have also been interpreted as van Rijsbergen’s (van Rijsbergen, 1980) similarity coefficients. Unlike detective stories, news documents give away the plot in the first few sentences. Therefore, the similarity measure could exploit the ranking, the ordinal of the sentence in which the term appears, in weighting the class-wise similarity.The rank-score of a term occurring times is (3) where is the ranking of theth instance of term.

Two TEMPORAL terms relate to each other on the time-axis, and the similarity of two LOCATION terms can be based on a geographical proximity represented in an ontology. For example, the utterances next week and the last week of March 2003 do not coincide on the surface, but when evaluated with respect to the utterance time, the expressions refer to the same temporal interval. Similarly, London and Thames can be found relevant based on an spatial ontology. Similarity in these ontologies could be a distance on the time-axis or a distance in a tree, as we have previously noted (Makkonen et al., 2003). Now, let us present the above discussion more formally. Each term in the document is a member of exactly one semantic class.

Papka observes that when increasing the weights of noun phrases and dates the classification accuracy improves and when decreasing them, the accuracy declines (Papka, 1999). 4.1 Event Vector A news document reporting an event states at the very barest what happened, where it happened, when it happened, and who was involved. The automatic extraction of these facts for natural language understanding is quite troublesome and time-consuming, and could still perform poorly. Previous detection and tracking approaches have tried to encapsulate these facts in a single vector. In order to attain the delicate distinctions mentioned above, to avoid the problems with the term-space maintenance and still maintain robustness, we assign each of the questions a semantic class, </context>

Note that there is no follow-ups for , and therefore it is not cut off. The problem of text summarization is similar to detecting topical shifts: traces of all the main topics occurring in the given text need to be retained in the summarization. On the other hand, text segmentation shares some qualities with the topic shift detection. Lexical cohesion (Boguraev and Neff, 2000) has been employed in the task as well as in text segmentation (Stokes et al., 2002). A model of Definition 4 has many open issues. For example, what is the topic representation and what kind of impact will there be on the evaluation? We will try to address the former question in the following. 4 Multi-vector Event Model It has been difficult to detect two distinct train accidents or bombings as different events (Allan et al., 1998a).

We present a new topic definition that has potential to model evolving events. We also discuss incorporating ontologies into the similarity measures of the topics, and illustrate a dynamic hierarchy that decreases the exhaustive computation performed in the TDT process. This is mainly work-in-progress. 1 Introduction A fairly novel area of retrieval called topic detection and tracking (TDT) attempts to design methods to automatically (1) spot new, previously unreported events, and (2) follow the progress ofthe previously spotted events (Allan et al., 1998c; Yang et al., 1998). Our contribution deals with three problems in TDT. Firstly, we present a new definition for a topic that would model the event evolution, i.e., the changing nature of a topic. The previous event definitions do not really lend themselves to this change. Secondly, we investigate an approach suggested by Makkonen, Ahonen-Myka and Salmenkivi (2002). They partitioned the termspace into four semantic classes and represented each class with a designated vector. Unlike the term-weighting model of Yang et al.

Predating TDT research, numerous historians and researchers of political science have wrestled with the definitions (Falk, 1989; Gerner et al., 1994). What seems to be somewhat agreed upon is that an event is some sort of activity conducted by some agent and taking place somewhere at some time. Definition 1 An event is something that happens at some specific time and place (Yang et al., 1999). This initial definition was adopted to TDT project and it is intuitively quite sound. Practically all of the events of the TDT test set yield to the temporal proximity (“burstiness”) and the compactness. However, there is also a number of problematic cases which this definition seems to neglect: events which either have a long-lasting nature (Intifada, Kosovo–Macedonia, struggle in Columbia), escalate to several large-scale threads or campaigns (September 11), or are not tightly spatiotemporally constrained (BSE-epidemics). The events in the world are not as autonomous as this definition ass</context>

Since TDT2 and TDT3 corpora are produced along this guideline, this is in a sense the de facto definition. Definition 4 A topic is a series of events, a narrative that evolves and may fork into several distinct topics. Definition 4 makes an attempt at addressing the changing or evolving nature of a topic. A seminal event can lead to several things at the same time and the connection between the various outcomes and the initial cause become less and less obvious as the events progress. As a practical consequence, the event evolution (Yang et al., 1999; Papka, 1999) causes changes in the vocabulary, especially in the crucial, identifying terms. The news documents are temporally linearly ordered, and the news stories can be said to form series of different lengths. Identifying these chains as topics is motivated by Falk’s investigations on historical events (Falk, 1989). A narrative begins as soon as the first story is encountered. Then the narrative is developed into one or more directions: simple events, like plane accidents might not have as many sub-plots as a political scandal, a war or economical crises.

This would lead to think that the identity of an event eludes all static representations and that the representation for a topic would have to adapt automatically to the various changes in the reporting of the event. Secondly, so far the parameters and thresholds of the state-of-the-art methods in IR have tried to capture this similarity of similarity, but there does not seem be a representation expressive enough (Allan et al., 2000). Thirdly, the detection and tracking is based on pairwise comparisons which requires exhaustive computation. Yang et al. (2002) suggested topic-categories that could be used to limit the search space of the first-story detection. However, building topic-categories automatically is difficult.

There is also a time-window to limit the temporal scope. Once a topic expires, it is removed from the dynamic hierarchy and archived to a news repository of lower operational priority. The use of static hierarchy has some of the benefits the topic-categories of Yang et al. (2002) had. It decreases the search space and enables a category-specific weighting-scheme for terms. For example, when a document is categorized to the class ’science’, there is no need to compare it against the events of any other class; ideally, all the relevant events have also been categorized to the same class. 6 Conclusion where is a length- vector of -structures closest to with respect to relation .
