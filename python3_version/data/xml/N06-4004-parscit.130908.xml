<bodyText confidence="0.999360857142857">
The MTTK alignment toolkit for statisti-
cal machine translation can be used for
word, phrase, and sentence alignment of
parallel documents. It is designed mainly
for building statistical machine translation
systems, but can be exploited in other
multi-lingual applications. It provides
computationally efficient alignment and
estimation procedures that can be used
for the unsupervised alignment of parallel
text collections in a language independent
fashion. MTTK Version 1.0 is available
under the Open Source Educational Com-
munity License.

<bodyText confidence="0.992475632653062">
Parallel text alignment procedures attempt to iden-
tify translation equivalences within collections of
translated documents. This can be be done at various
levels. At the finest level, this involves the alignment
of words and phrases within two sentences that are
known to be translations (Brown et al., 1993; Och
and Ney, 2003; Vogel et al., 1996; Deng and Byrne,
2005). Another task is the identification and align-
ment of sentence-level segments within document
pairs that are known to be translations (Gale and
Church, 1991); this is referred to as sentence-level
alignment, although it may also involve the align-
ment of sub-sentential segments (Deng et al., ) as
well as the identification of long segments in either
document which are not translations. There is also
document level translation which involves the iden-
tification of translated document pairs in a collection
of documents in multiple languages. As an example,
Figure 1 shows parallel Chinese/English text that is
aligned at the sentence, word, and phrase levels.
Parallel text plays a crucial role in multi-lingual
natural language processing research. In particu-
lar, statistical machine translation systems require
collections of sentence pairs (or sentence fragment
pairs) as the basic ingredients for building statistical
word and phrase alignment models. However, with
the increasing availability of parallel text, human-
created alignments are expensive and often unaf-
fordable for practical systems, even at a small scale.
High quality automatic alignment of parallel text has
therefore become indispensable. In addition to good
alignment quality, several other properties are also
desirable in automatic alignment systems. Ideally,
these should be general-purpose and language in-
dependent, capable of aligning very different lan-
guages, such as English, French, Chinese, German
and Arabic, to give a few examples of current in-
terest. If the alignment system is based on statis-
tical models, the model parameters should be esti-
mated from scratch, in an unsupervised manner from
whatever parallel text is available. To process mil-
lions of sentence pairs, these models need to be ca-
pable of generalization and the alignment and esti-
mation algorithms should be computationally effi-
cient. Finally, since noisy mismatched text is often
found in real data, such as parallel text mined from
web pages, automatic alignment needs to be robust.
There are systems available for these purposes, no-
tably the GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003) toolkit and

This demo introduces MTTK, the Machine Trans-
lation Toolkit. The toolkit can be used to train statis-
tical models and perform parallel text alignment at
different levels. Target applications include not only
machine translation, but also bilingual lexicon in-
duction, cross lingual information retrieval and other
multi-lingual applications.

2 MTTK Components
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999666">
MTTK is a collection of C++ programs and Perl
and shell scripts that can be used to build statisti-
cal alignment models from parallel text. Respective
of the text to be aligned, MTTK’s functions are cat-
egorized into the following two main parts.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.991714">
2.1 Chunk Alignment
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99993192">
Chunk alignment aims to extract sentence or sub-
sentence pairs from parallel corpora. A chunk
can be multiple sentences, a sentence or a sub-
sentence, as required by the application. Two align-
ment procedures are implemented: one is the widely
used dynamic programming procedure that derives
monotone alignment of sentence segments (Gale
and Church, 1991); the other is divisive clustering
procedure that begins by finding coarse alignments
that are then iteratively refined by successive binary
splitting (Deng et al., ). These two types of align-
ment procedures complement each other. They can
be used together to improve the overall sentence
alignment quality.
When translation lexicons are not available,
chunk alignment can be performed using length-
based statistics. This usually can serve as a start-
ing point of sentence alignment. Alignment qual-
ity can be further improved when the chunking pro-
cedure is based on translation lexicons from IBM
Model-1 alignment model (Brown et al., 1993). The
MTTK toolkit also generates alignment score for
each chunk pair, that can be utilized in post process-
ing, for example in filtering out aligned segments of
dubious quality.

2.2 Word and Phrase Alignment

<bodyText confidence="0.999964166666667">
After a collection of sentence or sub-sentence pairs
are extracted via chunk alignment procedures, sta-
tistical word and phrase alignment models can be
estimated with EM algorithms. MTTK provides im-
plementations of various alignment, models includ-
ing IBM Model-1, Model-2 (Brown et al., 1993),
HMM-based word-to-word alignment model (Vogel
et al., 1996; Och and Ney, 2003) and HMM-based
word-to-phrase alignment model (Deng and Byrne,
2005). After model parameters are estimated, the
Viterbi word alignments can be derived. A novel

3 MTTK Features
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999953791666667">
MTTK is designed to process huge amounts of par-
allel text. Model parameter estimation can be car-
ried out parallel during EM training using multiple
CPUs. The entire parallel text is split into parts.
During each E-step , statistics are collected paral-
lel over each part, while in the M-steps, these statis-
tics are merged together to update model parame-
ters for next iteration. This parallel implementation
not only reduces model training time significantly,
it also avoids memory usage issues that arise in pro-
cessing millions of sentence pairs, since each E-Step
need only save and process co-occurrence that ap-
pears in its part of the parallel text. This enables
building a single model from many millions of sen-
tence pairs.
Another feature of MTTK is language indepen-
dence. Linguistic knowledge is not required during
model training, although when it is available, per-
formance can be improved. Statistical parameters
are estimated and learned automatically from data
in an unsupervised way. To accommodate language
diversity, there are several parameters in MTTK that
can be tuned for individual applications to optimize
performance.

4 A Typical Application of MTTK in
Parallel Text Alignment
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999972358490566">
A typical example of using MTTK is give in Fig-
ure 2. It starts with a collection of document pairs.
During pre-processing, documents are normalized
and tokenized into token sequences. This prepro-
cessing is carried out before using the MTTK, and
is usually language dependent, requiring, for exam-
ple, segmenting Chinese characters into words or ap-
plying morphological analyzing to Arabic word se-
quences.
Statistical models are then built from scratch.
Chunk alignment begins with length statistics that
can be simply obtained by counting the number of
tokens on in each language. The chunk aligning
procedure then applies dynamic programming to de-
rive a sentence alignment. After sorting the gener-
ated sentence pairs by their probabilities, high qual-
ity sentence pairs are then selected and used to train
a translation lexicon. As an input for next round
chunk alignment, more and better sentence pairs can
be extracted and serve as training material for a bet-
ter translation lexicon. This bootstrapping procedure
identifies high quality sentence pairs in an iterative
fashion.
To maximize the number of training words for
building word and phrase alignment models, long
sentence pairs are then processed further using a di-
visive clustering chunk procedure that derives chunk
pairs at the sub-sentence level. This provides addi-
tional translation training pairs that would otherwise
be discarded as being overly long.
Once all usable chunk pairs are identified in the
chunk alignment procedure, word alignment model
training starts with IBM Model-1. Model com-
plexity increases gradually to Model-2, and then
HMM-based word-to-word alignment model, and
finally to HMM-based word-to-phrase alignment
model (Deng and Byrne, 2005). With these models,
word alignments can be obtained using the Viterbi
algorithm, and phrase pair posterior distributions
can be computed in building a phrase translation ta-
ble.
In published experiments we have found that
MTTK generates alignments of quality comparable
to those generated by GIZA++, where alignment
quality is measured both directly in terms of Align-
ment Error Rate relative to human word alignments
and indirectly through the translation performance
of systems constructed from the alignments (Deng
and Byrne, 2005). We have used MTTK as the basis
of translation systems entered into the recent NIST
Arabic-English and Chinese-English MT Evalua-
tions as well as the TC-STAR Chinese-English MT
evaluation (NIST, 2005; TC-STAR, 2005).
