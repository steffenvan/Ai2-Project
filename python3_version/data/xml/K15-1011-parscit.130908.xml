<bodyText confidence="0.999450833333333">
Most computational sociolinguistics stud-
ies have focused on phonological and
lexical variation. We present the first
large-scale study of syntactic variation
among demographic groups (age and gen-
der) across several languages. We har-
vest data from online user-review sites and
parse it with universal dependencies. We
show that several age and gender-specific
variations hold across languages, for ex-
ample that women are more likely to use
VP conjunctions.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999903265625">
Language varies between demographic groups.
To detect this variation, sociolinguistic studies
require both a representative corpus of text and
meta-information about the speakers. Tradition-
ally, this data was collected from a combination of
interview transcriptions and questionnaires. Both
methods are time-consuming, so population sizes
have been small, sometimes including less than
five subjects (Rickford and Price, 2013). While
these resources enable detailed qualitative analy-
ses, small sample sizes may lead to false research
findings (Button et al., 2013). Sociolinguistic
studies, in other words, often lack statistical
power to establish relationships between language
use and socio-economic variables.
Obtaining large enough data sets becomes even
more challenging the more complex the target
variables are. So while syntactic variation has
been identified as an important factor of variation
(Cheshire, 2005), it was not approached, due to its
high complexity. This paper addresses the issue
systematically on a large scale. In contrast to pre-
vious work in both sociolinguistics and NLP, we
consider syntactic variation across groups at the
level of treelets, as defined by dependency struc-
tures, and make use of a large corpus that includes
demographic information on both age and gender.
The impact of such findings goes beyond soci-
olinguistic insights: knowledge about systematic
differences among demographic groups can help
us build better and fairer NLP tools. Volkova et al.
(2013), Hovy and Søgaard (2015), Jørgensen et al.
(2015), and Hovy (2015) have shown the impact
of demographic factors on NLP performance.
Recently, the company Textio introduced a tool to
help phrase job advertisements in a gender-neutral
way.1 While their tool addresses lexical variation,
our results indicate that linguistic differences
extend to the syntactic level.
Previous work on demographic variation in both
sociolinguistics and NLP has begun to rely on cor-
pora from social media, most prominently Twitter.
Twitter offers a sufficiently large data source with
broad coverage (albeit limited to users with access
to social media). Indeed, results show that this
resource reflects the phonological and morpho-
lexical variation of spoken language (Eisenstein,
2013b; Eisenstein, 2013a; Doyle, 2014).
However, Twitter is not well-suited for the
study of syntactic variation for two reasons.
First, the limited length of the posts compels
the users to adopt a terse style that leaves out
many grammatical markers. As a consequence,
performance of syntactic parsers is prohibitive for
linguistic analysis in this domain. Second, Twitter
provides little meta-information about the users,
except for regional origin and time of posting.
Existing work has thus been restricted to these
demographic variables. One line of research has
focused on predictive models for age and gender
(Alowibdi et al., 2013; Ciot et al., 2013) to add
meta-data on Twitter, but again, error rates are too
high for use in sociolinguistic hypothesis testing.
We use a new source of data, namely the user

review site Trustpilot. The meta-information
on Trustpilot is both more prevalent and more
reliable, and textual data is not restricted in length
(see Table 2). We use state-of-the-art dependency
parsers trained on universal treebanks (McDonald
et al., 2013) to obtain comparable syntactic
analyses across several different languages and
demographics.
Contributions We present the first study of
morpho-syntactic variation with respect to demo-
graphic variables across several languages at a
large scale. We collect syntactic features within
demographic groups and analyze them to retrieve
the most significant differences. For the analysis
we use a method that preserves statistical power,
even when the number of possible syntactic
features is very large. Our results show that demo-
graphic differences extend beyond lexical choice.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999969285714286">
The TRUSTPILOT CORPUS consists of user re-
views from the Trustpilot website. On Trustpilot,
users can review company websites and leave a
one to five star rating, as well as a written review.
The data is available for 24 countries, using 13 dif-
ferent languages (Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish,
French, German, Italian, Norwegian, Polish, Por-
tuguese, Russian, Spanish, Swedish). In our study,
we are limited by the availability of comparable
syntactically annotated corpora (McDonald et
al., 2013) for five languages used in eleven
countries, i.e., English (Australia, Canada, UK,
and US), French (Belgium and France), German
(Switzerland and Germany), Italian, Spanish, and
Swedish. We treat the different variants of these
languages separately in the experiments below.2
Many users opt to provide a public profile.
There are no mandatory fields, other than name,
but many also supply their birth year, gender,
and location. We crawl the publicly available
information on the web site for users and reviews,
with different fields. Table 1 contains a list of the
fields that are available for each type of entity.
For more information on the data as a source for
demographic information, see Hovy et al. (2015).
We enhance the data set for our analysis by
adding gender information based on first names.
In order to add missing gender information, we

measure the distribution over genders for each
name. If a name occurs with sufficient frequency
and is found predominantly in one gender, we
propagate this gender to all occurrences of the
name that lack gender information. In our ex-
periments, we used a gender-purity factor of 0.95
(name occurs with one gender 95% of the time)
and a minimum frequency of 3 (name appears
at least 3 times in the data). Since names are
language-specific (Angel is male in Spanish, but
female in English), we run this step separately on
each language. On average, this measure doubled
the amount of gender information for a language.
Note that the domain (reviews) potentially
introduces a bias, but since our analysis is largely
at the syntactic level, we expect the effect to be
limited. While there is certainly a domain effect
at the lexical level, we assume that the syntactic
findings generalize better to other domains.

dependency parser (Martins et al., 2013) on a

treebank annotated with the Stanford dependency
labels (McDonald et al., 2013) and universal POS
tag set (Petrov et al., 2011). This gives us syntac-
tic analyses across all languages that describe the
same syntactic phenomena the same way. Figure
1 shows two corpus sentences annotated with this
harmonized representation.
The style of the reviews is much more canonical
than social web data, say Twitter. Expected parse
performance can be estimated from the SANCL
2012 shared task on dependency parsing of web
data (Petrov and McDonald, 2012). The best
result on the review domain there was 83.86 LAS
and 88.31 UAS, close to the average over all web
domains (83.45 LAS and 87.62 UAS).
From the parses, we extract all subtrees
of up to three tokens (treelets). We do not
distinguish between right- and left-branching
relations: the representation is basically a “bag
of relations”. The purpose of this is to increase
comparability across languages with different
word orderings (Naseem et al., 2012). A one-
token treelet is simply the POS tag of the token,
e.g. NOUN or VERB. A two-token treelet is a
typed relation between head and dependent, e.g.
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.3679065">

have two possible structures. Either the head
directly dominates two tokens, or the tokens are
linked together in a chain, as shown below:

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999326">
3.1 Treelet reduction
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999993">
We extract between 500,000 to a million distinct
treelets for each language. In principle, we
could directly check for significant differences
in the demographic groups and use Bonferroni
correction to control the family-wise error (i.e.,
the probability of obtaining a false positive).
However, given the large number of treelets,
the correction for multiple comparisons would
underpower our analyses and potentially cause us
to miss many significant differences. We therefore
reduce the number of treelets by two methods.
First, we set the minimum number of occur-
rences of a feature in each language to 50. We
apply this heuristic both to ensure statistical power
and to focus our analyses on prevalent rather than
rare syntactic phenomena.
Second, we perform feature selection using L1
randomized logistic regression models, with age
or gender as target variable, and the treelets as
input features. However, direct feature selection
with L1 regularized models (Ng, 2004) is prob-
lematic when variables are highly correlated (as
in our treelets, where e.g. three-token structures
can subsume smaller ones). As a result, small and
inessential variations in the dataset can determine
which of the variables are selected to represent the
group, so we end up with random within-group
feature selection.
We therefore use stability selection (Mein-
shausen and B¨uhlmann, 2010). Stability selection
mitigates the correlation problem by fitting the
logistic regression model hundreds of times
with perturbed data (75% subsampling and
feature-wise regularization scaling). Features
that receive non-zero weights across many runs
can be assumed to be highly indicative. Stability
selection thus gives all features a chance to be
selected. It controls the false positive rate, which
is less conservative than family-wise error. We
use the default parameters of a publicly available
stability selection implementation3, run it on the
whole data set, and discard features selected less
than 50% of the time.
With the reduced feature set, we check for
usage differences in demographic groups (age and
gender) using a x2 test. We distinguish two age
groups: speakers that are younger than 35, and
speakers older than 45. These thresholds were
chosen to balance the size of both groups. At
this stage we set the desired p-value at 0.02 and
apply Bonferroni correction, effectively dividing
the p-value threshold by the number of remaining
treelets.4
Note, finally, that the average number of words
written by a reviewer differs between the demo-
graphic groups (younger users tend to write more
than older ones, women more than men). To coun-
teract this effect, the expected counts in our null
hypothesis use the proportion of words written by
people in a group, rather than the proportion of
people in the group (which would skew the results
towards the groups with longer reviews).
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.97372575">

4Choosing a P-value is somewhat arbitrary. Effectively,
our P-value cutoff is several orders of magnitude lower than
0.02, due to the Bonferroni correction.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999848">
We are interested in robust syntactic variation
across languages; that is, patterns that hold across
most or all of the languages considered here.
We therefore score each of the identified treelets
by the number of languages with a significant
difference in occurrence between the groups of
the given demographic variable. Again, we use
a rather conservative non-parametric hypothesis
test, with Bonferroni correction.
Tables 3 and 4 show the results for age and
gender, respectively. The first column shows
the number of languages in which the treelet
(third column) is significant. The fourth and fifth
column indicate for which age or gender subgroup
the feature is indicative, and how much larger the
rate of occurrence is there in percent. The indices
in the last column represent containment relation-
ships, i.e., when a treelet is strictly contained in
another treelet (indexed by the rank given in the
second column).
In the case of gender, three atomic treelets
(parts of speech) correlate significantly across
all 11 languages. Two treelets correlate signifi-
cantly across 10 languages. For age, five treelets
correlate significantly across 10 languages.
In sum, men seem to use numerals and nouns
more than women across languages, whereas
women use pronouns and verbs more often. Men
use nominal compounds more often than women
in nine out of eleven languages. Women, on the
other hand, use VP coordinations more in eight
out of eleven languages.
For age, some of the more striking patterns
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.993093">

<bodyText confidence="0.994797333333334">
involve prepositional phrases, which see higher
use in the older age group. In atomic treelets, noun
use is slightly higher in the older group, while pro-
nouns are more often used by younger reviewers.
Our results address a central question in varia-
tional linguistics, namely whether syntax plays a
role in language variation among groups. While
this has been long suspected, it was never empir-
ically researched due to the perceived complexity.
Our findings are the first to corroborate the
hypotheses that language variation goes beyond
the lexical level.

We also present the pairwise overlap in signif-

Percentages in the pairwise comparisons are nor-

Italian and Spanish also share many features with

5.1 Gender differences
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999792444444444">
The top features for gender differences are mostly
atomic (pre-terminals), indicating that we observe
the same effect as mentioned previously in the
literature (Schler et al., 2006), namely that certain
parts-of-speech are prevalent in one gender.
1 , 2 , 3 For all languages, the use of numerals
and nouns is significantly correlated with men,
while pronouns and verbs are more indicative of
women. When looking at the types of pronouns
used by men and women, we see very similar
distributions, but men tend to use impersonal
pronouns (it, what) more than women do. Nouns
and numbers are associated with the alleged
“information emphasis” of male language use
(Schler et al., 2006). Numbers typically indicate
prices or model numbers, while nouns are usually
company names.
The robustness of POS features could to some
extent be explained by the different company cat-
egories reviewed by each gender: in COMPUTER
&amp; ACCESSORIES and CAR LIGHTS the reviews
are predominately by men, while the reviews in
the PETS and CLOTHES &amp; FASHION categories
are mainly posted by women. Using numerals
and nouns is more likely when talking about
computers and car lights than when talking about
pets and clothing, for example.

6 Semantic variation within syntactic
categories
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999936170731707">
Given that a number of the indicative features are
single treelets (POS tags), we wondered whether
there are certain semantic categories that fill these
slots. Since we work across several languages, we
are looking for semantically equivalent classes.
We collect the most significant adjectives and
adverbs for each gender for each language and
map the words to all of their possible lexical
groups in BabelNet (Navigli and Ponzetto, 2010).
This creates lexical equivalence classes. Table 6
shows the results. We purposefully exclude nouns
and verbs here, as there is too much variation to
detect any patterns.
The number of languages that share lexical
items from the same BabelNet class is typically
smaller than the number of languages that share a
treelet. Nevertheless, we observe certain patterns.
The results for gender are presented in Table
6. For adverbs, the division seems to be about
intensity: men use more downtoners (approx-
imately; almost; still), while women use more
intensifiers (actually; really; truly; quite; lots).
This finding is new, in that it directly contradicts
the perceived wisdom of female language as being
more restrained and hedging.
In their use of adjectives, on the other hand,
men highlight “factual” properties of the subject,
such as price (inexpensive) and quality (cheap;
best; professional), whereas women use more
qualitative adjectives that express the speaker’s
opinion about the subject (fantastic; amazing;
pretty) or their own state (happy), although we
also find the “factual” assessment simple.
Table 7 shows the results for age. There are
not many adjectives that group together, and they
do not show a clear pattern. Most of the adverbs
are indicative of the younger group, although
there is overlap with the older group (this is due
to different sets of words mapping to the same
class). We did not find any evidence for pervasive
age effects across languages.

Sociolinguistic studies investigate the relation
between a speaker’s linguistic choices and
socio-economic variables. This includes regional
origin (Schmidt and Herrgen, 2001; Nerbonne,
2003; Wieling et al., 2011), age (Barke, 2000;
Barbieri, 2008; Rickford and Price, 2013), gender
(Holmes, 1997; Rickford and Price, 2013), social
class (Labov, 1964; Milroy and Milroy, 1992;
Macaulay, 2001; Macaulay, 2002), and ethnicity
(Carter, 2013; Rickford and Price, 2013). We
focus on age and gender in this work.
Corpus-based studies of variation have largely
been conducted either by testing for the presence
or absence of a set of pre-defined words (Pen-
nebaker et al., 2001; Pennebaker et al., 2003), or
by analysis of the unigram distribution (Barbieri,
2008). This approach restricts the findings to
the phenomena defined in the hypothesis, in this
case the word list used. In contrast, our approach
works beyond the lexical level, is data-driven and
thus unconstrained by prior hypotheses.

regression to predict demographic attributes
from term frequencies, and vice versa. Using
sparsity-inducing priors, they identify key lexical
variations between linguistic communities. While
they mention syntactic variation as possible future
work, their method has not yet been applied
to syntactically parsed data. Our method is
simpler than theirs, yet goes beyond words. We
learn demographic attributes from raw counts of
syntactic treelets rather than term frequencies,
and test for group differences between the most
predictive treelets and the demographic variables.
We also use a sparsity-inducing regularizer.
Kendall et al. (2011) study dative alternations
on a 250k-words corpus of transcribed spoken
Afro-American Vernacular English. They use
logistic regression to correlate syntactic features
and dialect, similar to Eisenstein et al. (2011), but
their study differs from ours in using manually
annotated data, studying only one dialect and
demographic variable, and using much less data.
Stewart (2014) uses POS tags to study morpho-
syntactic features of Afro-American Vernacular
English on Twitter, such as copula deletion, ha-
bitual be, null genitive marking, etc. Our study is
different from his in using full syntactic analyses,
studying variation across age and gender rather
than ethnicity, and in studying syntactic variation
across several languages.

8 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998519047619">
Syntax has been identified as an important factor
in language variation among groups, but not
addressed. Previous work has been limited by
data size or availability of demographic meta-data.
Existing studies on variation have thus mostly
focused on lexical and phonological variation.
In contrast, we study the effect of age and
gender on syntactic variation across several
languages. We use a large-scale data source
(international user-review websites) and parse
the data, using the same formalisms to maximize
comparability. We find several highly significant
age- and gender-specific syntactic patterns.
As NLP applications for social media become
more widespread, we need to address their
performance issues. Our findings suggest that
including extra-linguistic factors (which become
more and more available) could help improve
performance of these systems. This requires a
discussion of approaches to corpora construction
and the development of new models.

However, Twitter is not well-suited for the study of syntactic variation for two reasons. First, the limited length of the posts compels the users to adopt a terse style that leaves out many grammatical markers. As a consequence, performance of syntactic parsers is prohibitive for linguistic analysis in this domain. Second, Twitter provides little meta-information about the users, except for regional origin and time of posting. Existing work has thus been restricted to these demographic variables. One line of research has focused on predictive models for age and gender (Alowibdi et al., 2013; Ciot et al., 2013) to add meta-data on Twitter, but again, error rates are too high for use in sociolinguistic hypothesis testing.

While these resources enable detailed qualitative analyses, small sample sizes may lead to false research findings (Button et al., 2013). Sociolinguistic studies, in other words, often lack statistical power to establish relationships between language use and socio-economic variables. Obtaining large enough data sets becomes even more challenging the more complex the target variables are. So while syntactic variation has been identified as an important factor of variation (Cheshire, 2005), it was not approached, due to its high complexity. This paper addresses the issue systematically on a large scale. In contrast to previous work in both sociolinguistics and NLP, we consider syntactic variation across groups at the level of treelets, as defined by dependency structures, and make use of a large corpus that includes demographic information on both age and gender. The impact of such findings goes beyond sociolinguistic insights: knowledge about systematic differences among demographic groups can help us build better and fairer NLP tools. Volkova et al.

Second, Twitter provides little meta-information about the users, except for regional origin and time of posting. Existing work has thus been restricted to these demographic variables. One line of research has focused on predictive models for age and gender (Alowibdi et al., 2013; Ciot et al., 2013) to add meta-data on Twitter, but again, error rates are too high for use in sociolinguistic hypothesis testing.

We focus on age and gender in this work. Corpus-based studies of variation have largely been conducted either by testing for the presence or absence of a set of pre-defined words (Pennebaker et al., 2001; Pennebaker et al., 2003), or by analysis of the unigram distribution (Barbieri, 2008). This approach restricts the findings to the phenomena defined in the hypothesis, in this case the word list used.

Our method is simpler than theirs, yet goes beyond words. We learn demographic attributes from raw counts of syntactic treelets rather than term frequencies, and test for group differences between the most predictive treelets and the demographic variables. We also use a sparsity-inducing regularizer. Kendall et al. (2011) study dative alternations on a 250k-words corpus of transcribed spoken Afro-American Vernacular English. They use logistic regression to correlate syntactic features and dialect, similar to Eisenstein et al. (2011), but their study differs from ours in using manually annotated data, studying only one dialect and demographic variable, and using much less data. Stewart (2014) uses POS tags to study morphosyntactic features of Afro-American Vernacular English on Twitter, such as copula deletion, habitual be, null genitive marking, etc. Our study is different from his in using full syntactic analyses, studying variation across age and gender rather than ethnicity, and in studying syntactic variation across several languages. 8 Conclusion Syntax has been identified as an important factor in language variatio</context>

A two-token treelet is a typed relation between head and dependent, e.g. VERB −−−−→NOUN. Treelets of three tokens NSUBJ have two possible structures. Either the head directly dominates two tokens, or the tokens are linked together in a chain, as shown below: 3.1 Treelet reduction We extract between 500,000 to a million distinct treelets for each language.

Since we work across several languages, we are looking for semantically equivalent classes. We collect the most significant adjectives and adverbs for each gender for each language and map the words to all of their possible lexical groups in BabelNet (Navigli and Ponzetto, 2010). This creates lexical equivalence classes. Table 6 shows the results. We purposefully exclude nouns and verbs here, as there is too much variation to detect any patterns. The number of languages that share lexical items from the same BabelNet class is typically smaller than the number of languages that share a treelet. Nevertheless, we observe certain patterns. The results for gender are presented in Table 6. For adverbs, the division seems to be about intensity: men use more downtoners (approximately; almost; still), while women use more intensifiers (actually; really; truly; quite; lots). T</context>

We therefore reduce the number of treelets by two methods. First, we set the minimum number of occurrences of a feature in each language to 50. We apply this heuristic both to ensure statistical power and to focus our analyses on prevalent rather than rare syntactic phenomena. Second, we perform feature selection using L1 randomized logistic regression models, with age or gender as target variable, and the treelets as input features. However, direct feature selection with L1 regularized models (Ng, 2004) is problematic when variables are highly correlated (as in our treelets, where e.g. three-token structures can subsume smaller ones). As a result, small and inessential variations in the dataset can determine which of the variables are selected to represent the group, so we end up with random within-group feature selection. We therefore use stability selection (Meinshausen and B¨uhlmann, 2010). Stability selection mitigates the correlation problem by fitting the logistic regression model hundreds of times with perturbed data (75% subsampling and feature-wise regularization scaling).

We show that several age and gender-specific variations hold across languages, for example that women are more likely to use VP conjunctions. 1 Introduction Language varies between demographic groups. To detect this variation, sociolinguistic studies require both a representative corpus of text and meta-information about the speakers. Traditionally, this data was collected from a combination of interview transcriptions and questionnaires. Both methods are time-consuming, so population sizes have been small, sometimes including less than five subjects (Rickford and Price, 2013). While these resources enable detailed qualitative analyses, small sample sizes may lead to false research findings (Button et al., 2013). Sociolinguistic studies, in other words, often lack statistical power to establish relationships between language use and socio-economic variables. Obtaining large enough data sets becomes even more challenging the more complex the target variables are. So while syntactic variation has been identified as an important factor of variation (Cheshire, 2005), it was not approached, due to its high complexity.

In Section 5, we analyze our results in more depth. 5 Analysis of syntactic variation Due to space constraints, we restrict our analysis to a few select treelets with good coverage and interpretable results. 5.1 Gender differences The top features for gender differences are mostly atomic (pre-terminals), indicating that we observe the same effect as mentioned previously in the literature (Schler et al., 2006), namely that certain parts-of-speech are prevalent in one gender. 1 , 2 , 3 For all languages, the use of numerals and nouns is significantly correlated with men, while pronouns and verbs are more indicative of women. When looking at the types of pronouns used by men and women, we see very similar distributions, but men tend to use impersonal pronouns (it, what) more than women do. Nouns and numbers are associated with the alleged “information emphasis” of male language use (Schler et al., 2006). Numbers typically indicate prices or model numbers, while nouns are usually company names. The ro</context>

This includes regional origin (Schmidt and Herrgen, 2001; Nerbonne, 2003; Wieling et al., 2011), age (Barke, 2000; Barbieri, 2008; Rickford and Price, 2013), gender (Holmes, 1997; Rickford and Price, 2013), social class (Labov, 1964; Milroy and Milroy, 1992; Macaulay, 2001; Macaulay, 2002), and ethnicity (Carter, 2013; Rickford and Price, 2013). We focus on age and gender in this work. Corpus-based studies of variation have largely been conducted either by testing for the presence or absence of a set of pre-defined words (Pennebaker et al., 2001; Pennebaker et al., 2003), or by analysis of the unigram distribution (Barbieri, 2008).

We also use a sparsity-inducing regularizer. Kendall et al. (2011) study dative alternations on a 250k-words corpus of transcribed spoken Afro-American Vernacular English. They use logistic regression to correlate syntactic features and dialect, similar to Eisenstein et al. (2011), but their study differs from ours in using manually annotated data, studying only one dialect and demographic variable, and using much less data. Stewart (2014) uses POS tags to study morphosyntactic features of Afro-American Vernacular English on Twitter, such as copula deletion, habitual be, null genitive marking, etc. Our study is different from his in using full syntactic analyses, studying variation across age and gender rather than ethnicity, and in studying syntactic variation across several languages. 8 Conclusion Syntax has been identified as an important factor in language variation among groups, but not addressed. Previous work has been limited by data size or availability of demographic meta-data. Existing studies on variation have thus m</context>

This paper addresses the issue systematically on a large scale. In contrast to previous work in both sociolinguistics and NLP, we consider syntactic variation across groups at the level of treelets, as defined by dependency structures, and make use of a large corpus that includes demographic information on both age and gender. The impact of such findings goes beyond sociolinguistic insights: knowledge about systematic differences among demographic groups can help us build better and fairer NLP tools. Volkova et al. (2013), Hovy and Søgaard (2015), Jørgensen et al. (2015), and Hovy (2015) have shown the impact of demographic factors on NLP performance. Recently, the company Textio introduced a tool to help phrase job advertisements in a gender-neutral way.1 While their tool addresses lexical variation, our results indicate that linguistic differences extend to the syntactic level. Previous work on demographic variation in both sociolinguistics and NLP has begun to rely on corpora from social media, most prominently Twitter. Twitter offers a sufficiently large data source with broad coverage (albeit limited to u</context>
