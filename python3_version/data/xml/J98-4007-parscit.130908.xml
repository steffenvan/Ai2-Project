This paperback, consisting of eleven essays, all but three in French, on temporal
anaphora and coherence, initiates the series Cahiers Chronos, with a Franco-Belgian-
Dutch editorial board directed by Carl Vetters. Lacking an editorial policy statement
outlining the strategic directions for future volumes in the series, the book must be
taken at face value, as an apparently unrefereed collection of papers of rather dis-
parate quality, probably read at a meeting by the authors. The editors provide a short
summary as introduction and outline two conclusions as uniting themes (p. iv, my
translation):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.994978166666667">
• Deixis and anaphora should not be employed to characterize time, but to
characterize certain types of discourse and as strategies that allow the
assignment of coherence to discourses.
• Coherence is not only established at a global level, it is also constructed
at a local level where the types of NPs, selected by the predicates and
their aspectual-temporal values, must be compatible.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99456995">
The editors emphasize the following analogy between NPs and tenses. The simple
past is analogous to the indefinite NP, as it may shift the reference time. But it is also
anaphoric, as this time may be temporally dependent upon a prior one. Anadeictic
is the proposed neologism for this combination of dependent indefinite behavior of
the simple past. The perfect tense describes the resulting state, and is considered to
be like a demonstrative NP in being dependent directly on the speech time. Lastly,
the French imparfait is considered analogous to the definite NP, as it does not shift the
reference time, but depends on a given one. Although this analogy has proven its use
in the current dynamic theories of meaning and interpretation, not all the authors ad-
here to this logical toolkit. Disparate terminologies and eclectic use of representational
systems, ranging from Langacker&apos;s pictorial cognitive models to Structured Discourse
Representation Theory, make the book hard reading for even the patient reader of Com-
putational Linguistics who is open to a healthy diversification of explanatory accounts
in linguistics.
I will briefly summarize the eleven chapters and conclude with an overall assess-
ment of what contribution the book makes to the state of the art in linguistic theories
of tense and aspect.
Chapter 1, by Michel Charolles, studies the constraints induced by the notori-
ously difficult intensional verb to change for discourse NP anaphora. Explicitly stated
is the core issue of how coreference should be expressed in a given context, using

either a simple pronoun, a demonstrative or indexical, or a descriptive referring NP. A
present-perfect clause does not provide enough information by itself to determine the
referent of the pronoun, but the VP of the second clause must be used in its resolution.
Consider:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.990880666666667">
(1) The waiter has changed the tablecloth. It {was I *is} dirty.
(2) The waiter has changed the tablecloth. It {is I *was} clean.
(3) The waiter has changed the tablecloth. It is in the laundry.
(4) The waiter has changed the tablecloth. ?It was less nice.
(5) The waiter has changed the tablecloth. *The next one was in the closet.
(6) The waiter is changing the tablecloth. It {*is I was} clean.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999841176470588">
The pronoun it refers to either the old tablecloth or the new tablecloth, depending on
tense and lexical relations (examples 1-3). Comparative elliptical VPs are questionable
in such contexts (example 4) and indexical coreferring expressions are unacceptable
(example 5). A present-progressive first clause does not provide an antecedent for
the clean table cloth, but does provide one for the old one (example 6). The account
attempts to use indexing as an explanatory mechanism for coreference or disjoint
reference. It remains unresolved as to how the pronoun resolution strategy must be
modeled in syntax. Rather than delving more deeply into these interesting issues, the
paper reviews a number of intensional contexts created by change as an intransitive
or transitive verb, concluding that tense may also determine the nature of modality.
Langacker &apos;s iconic representations are then presented as dynamic sequences of states
with a trajectory, without any clarification of what the author&apos;s boldface typography
means or how two Venn-like diagrams in such a sequence are related.
Chapter 2 is by llse Depraetere, who is proud to use corpus data but adjusting
them to suit her own case. She discusses the sequence of tense in present-perfect main
clauses that have either present or past-perfect subordinate clauses. The present-perfect
is bad with definite adverbials referring to the past.

(7) She has made good progress ... , since she took the medicine I
{had I *have} prescribed at her last visit.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999880571428571">
The facts could well be accounted for satisfactorily in Discourse Representation Theory
(Kamp and Reyle 1993), but no use is made of such semantic tools. An intriguing
remark about the role of stress in providing a link to the speech time (pp. 36-7) is
buried deeply in the rather unstructured discussion in the remainder of the paper.
Chapter 3, by Daniele Godard and Jacques Jayez, distinguishes between weak
and strong event-denoting NPs, where only the latter can be said to take place, even
though the weak events form a subset of the strong ones.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9986875">
(8) Weak event: *the symphony took place
(9) Strong event: the concert took place
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99952725">
The second distinction is a dichotomy between material and informational objects,
where the latter are located somewhere or contain something, and the former have
weight or exist. The paper discusses how these four types may affect anaphora, arguing
that a certain looseness is often acceptable.

The resulting observations are formulated in a constraint:
When the type of pronoun is incompatible with that of the antecedent,
the structure is marginally acceptable if the semantic representation of
the antecedent or the VP applied to the antecedent provides a com-
patible type that serves as antecedent of the pronoun. (p. 57, my trans-
lation)
No further suggestions are offered of how a semantic representation would accomplish
this.
Chapter 4, by Jacqueline Gueron, is the most tightly argued paper in the collection,
with a solid generative rooting in binding theory. Compositionality is espoused: every
morpheme and syntactic relation between morphemes contributes to the interpreta-
tion. The paper addresses the question of why French differs from English (12) and
Arabic in not admitting a simple past perception verb in (13):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.995423">
(12) I saw Mary this morning.
(13) *Je vis Marie ce matin.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999118607142857">
What parameter explains the difference between the English and the French? And how
can a complex temporal structure convey the same sense as a simple temporal struc-
ture, given the compositionality principle needed for the coherence of the grammar?
Binding theory with temporal chains is presented, with parameters for the reference
time and the speech time in Comp, an event argument in the verbal argument struc-
ture, and T, the head of a Tense Phrase, &amp;quot;satisfying&amp;quot; this event argument. Movement
of indexed T with a Perf (perfect) feature accounts for the observed difference between
English and French. English and Arabic are said to lack any visible imperfective mor-
phology, whereas French alternates between visible and invisible imperfective forms
but lacks perfective verbal morphology, as its perfective morphology is considered
to be nominal. Compositionality is argued to be preserved as the simple past in En-
glish, and the situation in Arabic is analyzed as complex, constructed as a conjunction
of the present and perfective aspect, whereas French accomplishes this conjunction
overtly with an auxiliary verb (p. 76). This is good generative syntax, but it still re-
quires spelling out a clear compositional semantics in terms of satisfaction conditions
in temporal models, interval- or event-based.
Chapter 5, by Theo A. J. M. Janssen, shows an unfortunate misunderstanding of
the analogy in Partee (1973) between pronouns and tenses, first considering tenses on
a par with demonstratives and then equating these with definite descriptions. Their
&amp;quot;definiteness&amp;quot; is subsequently explicated by appealing to the Deictic Construal (p. 85),
consisting of seven conditions in which such notions as mental field of vision, vantage
point, region, salience of entities in regions, uniqueness of such entities in regions, and
focal or disfocal referential concern all play a role. The elaboration of the analogy be-
tween pronouns and tenses with adverbials in Partee (1984) is equally misrepresented
as advocating a time-based approach to tenses, where past tense is optional with overt
indexical temporal adverbials. The misunderstandings must, however, be superficial,
as Janssen&apos;s account of Partee&apos;s classic example (14) strikes me as a perfectly com-
patible informal rendition—in terms of extralinguistic context or situation of context,

assumed to be common conversational ground—of Partee&apos;s logical analysis of past
tense as introducing a contextually determined event.
(14) I did not turn off the stove. (Partee 1973, p. 602)
The sentence hence cannot be interpreted as negating the existence of some past event
of stove-turning-off by the speaker. In a more useful section of the paper, the short-
comings of Reichenbach&apos;s (1947) well-known temporal reference system in application
to Dutch are discussed, proposing to improve over it with the Deictic Construal sys-
tem. This positive proposal needs much more elaboration and proper definition of the
explanatory concepts before it can be properly assessed.
Chapter 6, by Arie Molendijk, takes a rather more careful look at the issue of when,
if at all, verbal lexical presuppositions induce antecedents for nominal or temporal
anaphora, supported by mostly French data. The view that textual relations must
license such dependencies is defended. Five such relations are given: (1) explication,
relating simple past to imparfait; (2) manner or elaboration, relating two imparfaits;
(3) backgrounding, relating simple past and imparfait; (4) consequent or result, relating
simple past and imparfait; and (5) incidence, relating imparfait to simple past. The
conclusion is reached that the temporal antecedent of a clause must be a fact to which
the clause is related by means of a textual relation. The temporal relation characterized
by this textual relation must correspond to the one provided by the grammatical tense
of the clause (p. 115). This leaves wide open the &amp;quot;hot potato&amp;quot; of whether the temporal
relations determine the textual ones or vice versa, which is currently the target of
much discussion and disagreement in the literature.
Chapter 7, by two of the editors, Liliane Tasmowski–De Ryck and Carl Vetters,
assumes as its central point of departure the parallel mentioned above between indef-
inite NPs and simple past (here called anadeictic), demonstratives and perfect tense,
and definite NPs and the French imparfait. Certain observations with such tenses in dis-
course are accounted for, assuming, however puzzling, that the order of presentation
of clauses is most often indicative of the order in which the described events occurred.
The definite character of the imparfait is not explained as lacking dynamic force, but
rather by appealing to the fact that events may be described in many possible ways.
Chapter 8, by Co Vet, makes good use of Structured Discourse Representation
Theory and the two narrative strategies of Levelt (1982) for guiding someone through
a maze, arguing that discourse types may be defined by notions of temporal deixis,
pseudodeixis, and anaphora, which determine the choice of tense. This paper presents
detailed and useful examples of SDRT representations of texts along with careful dis-
cussion.
The three remaining papers are of lesser quality, with Tuija Virtanen analyzing then
as helping to segment textual boundaries, creating coherence or &amp;quot;to create a peak-
salience profile of a narrative&amp;quot; (p. 177); Svetlana Vogeleer arguing that perceptual
points of view are constructed as anchoring points for the interpretation of the impar-
fait; and Marc Wilmet distinguishing the logical imparfait from stylistic usage, claiming
that reduction of the latter to the former would create incoherence.
Editorial work is rather thankless, as anyone who undertakes it must soon realize.
A job well done is invisible by necessity, but a bad editorial job is often painfully
obvious. This book would have profited considerably from much tighter editorial
control of the often disparate and diverse terminology, with much more substantial
cross-referencing of the themes, tools, and topics addressed. Some of the most valuable
papers (Chapters 3, 4, and 8, especially) are excellent contributions to the current
linguistic debates on tense and aspect. But collecting these with some papers that

barely exceed the level of a first-year graduate student in linguistics does them a
disservice. A collection need not be united in tools or explanatory theoretical terms,
but standards of clarity and rigor should apply across the board. Yet this book may
prove useful to the ever-growing community of linguists working on tense and aspect
in discourse. It contains authentic French texts, fresh data, also from Dutch and Arabic,
and a plethora of interesting informal discussions of issues that lend themselves easily
to logical formalization and computational analysis. A clear and concise statement of
the issues for further research could have helped the reader, along with a positive
assessment of the points of agreement and consensus. Lay-out is at times careless, with
placement of trees at times forcing large white sections on some pages (for example,
page 73), and an index would have been helpful.
