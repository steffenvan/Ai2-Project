We present CARPANTA, an e-mail summariza-
tion system that applies a knowledge intensive
approach to obtain highly coherent summaries.
Robustness and portability are guaranteed by
the use of general-purpose NLP tools, but it
also exploits language- and domain-dependent
knowledge. The system is evaluated against

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999525222222222">
We present CARPANTA, the e-mail summariza-
tion system within project PETRA. PETRA is
related to the European project MAJORDOME -
Unified Messaging System (E!-2340), whose aim
is to introduce a unified messaging system that
allows users to access e-mail, voice mail, and
faxes from a common &amp;quot;in-box&amp;quot;.
One of the lines of work developed within PE-
TRA is the use of Natural Language Procesing
(NLP) techniques for information management,
namely, for text classification and summariza-
tion, as well as for information retrieval. This
task includes the subgoal of text summarization,
specially relevant for oral interfaces to electronic
mail systems.
The summarization module within PETRA is
CARPANTA. It is currently working for Spanish,
but portability to other languages is guaranteed
by a language-independent core.
The rest of the paper is structured as fol-
lows: first, NLP problems specific to e-mail
summarization and our approach to them are
described, comparing it with previous work.
Section 3 presents the architecture of the sys-
tem. The system is evaluated by comparison
with a human-made gold standard, results can
be seen in Section 4.

2 Problems of e-mail summarization
Besides the problems specific to automatic text
summarization, e-mail summarization presents:
• noisy input (headers, tags,...)
• no guarantee of linguistic well-formedness
• mixed properties of oral and written lan-
guage
• multi-topic messages
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998367911764706">
High-quality, general-purpose NLP tools can-
not deal properly with such a bulk of asys-
tematic differences from standard texts. This
implies a barrier for approaches to text sum-
marization that have proven successful in more
standard genres, because they are crucially re-
lying on the output of such tools.
As a consequence, very little work has been
done on quality e-mail summarization. (Tzouk-
ermann et al., 2001) aim to capture the
gist of e-mail messages by extracting salient
noun phrases, using a combination of ma-
chine learning and shallow linguistic analysis.
(Nenkova and Bagga, 2003) apply standard
multi-document summarization techniques to
produce written extracts of e-mail threads.
Considering e-mail summarization problems
and the environment within PETRA project,
summaries produced by CARPANTA have the
following properties:
oral output by telephone,
indicative summaries just give a hint of the
content, to meet the severe restrictions of
length imposed by the oral format,
coherent because the summary cannot be re-
vised as easily as written ones, (thus ex-
cluding list-of-words approach),
extractive due to limitations for general-
purpose NLP tools,
knowledge-intensive combining analysis at
different linguistic levels, IR techniques and
IE strategies specific for e-mail, in order to
build a robust system that is also capable
of producing deep analyses.

<bodyText confidence="0.996897909090909">
As can be seen in Figure 1, CARPANTA is
highly modular, which guarantees portabil-
ity to other languages. The core process-
ing stream is formed by language-independent
strategies, while e-mail specific knowledge is in
autonomous modules that can be updated and
switched to address concrete necessities (differ-
ent languages, restricted domains).
In addition to general-purpose NLP tools, the
following e-mail specific resources were devel-
oped:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.997453">
• a classification where each kind of e-mail is
associated to its most adequate summary
and summarization strategy (language-
independent) (seen in Table 1)
• bags of words and expressions that signal
different kinds of e-mail specific contents
(language-dependent)
• strategies to deal with these anchors
and their associated content (language-
independent)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999019806451613">
The process for e-mails to be summarized is
described in what follows.
Parse e-mail format. Messages undergo
a pre-processing to identify headers, greetings,
visit cards, quoted text, and the body of text,
which is further analyzed.
Linguistic analysis. First, the body of text
is analyzed morphosyntactically (Atserias et al.,
1998a) and chunks are identified (Atserias et al.,
1998b). Then, discourse chunks, signalled by
punctuation and discourse markers, are found
(what we call segments). Finally, the salience of
non-empty words is calculated according to the
frequency of occurrence of their lemma
Textual analysis. Three different kinds of
textual relevance have been distinguished: lexic,
structural and subjective. For each of these
three aspects of e-mails, a global reliability score
is obtained, taking into account how well each
kind of information distinguishes relevant and
non-relevant pieces of the e-mail. Then, rele-
vance is also calculated with respect to mean-
ing units, basically, discourse segments. Lexic
relevance of a segment is directly proportional
to the amount of frequent words in the segment
and inversely proportional to the length of the
segment. Structural relevance is assigned as a
result of the interpretation of discursive rela-
tions between segments and between a segment
and the whole text, by means of the informa-
tion associated to discourse markers. Finally,

subjective relevance is found when the segment
contains any of a list of lexical expressions sig-
nalling subjectivity.
Documental analysis. Key words and ex-
pressions signalling information specific of e-
mail (e.g., appointment, list, etc.) are detected
by simple IE techniques, basically, pattern-
matching.
As a result of linguistic, textual and doc-
umental analysis, a set of meaning units is
produced at different linguistic levels: words,
chunks, segments and sentences, but also lines
and paragraphs. Each unit is assigned a com-
plex relevance score, one for each kind of infor-
mation that is taken into account. Values for
lexical, structural and subjective relevance are
continious, ranging from 0 to 1. Each unit is
also assinged a binary relevance score for each
kind of e-mail specific information, 1 if there is
any clue signalling that kind of information in
the unit, 0 if there is none.
Classification The most adequate summa-
rization strategy is determined by taking into
account the characterizing features of each e-
mail, as provided by the analysis module. The
general schema followed by classification rules
can be seen in Figure 2, Table 1 shows the rela-
tion between e-mail features and summarization
strategies.
Summarization Then, the chosen summary
is produced. Different kinds of summaries are
described in Table 1.

were compared with summaries produced for
200 e-mails by 20 potential users of the sys-
tem, with a minimum of 2 different human sum-
maries for each e-mail. Agreement between
judges ranged from lc = —.37 to lc = 1, with
a mean of lc = .47, which indicates that agree-
ment is far beyond chance, but also that the
task of e-mail summarization is somewhat fuzzy
for users.
The goodness of automatic summaries was
calculated by comparison with the correspond-
ing human summaries, results can be seen in
Figure 3. For each e-mail, automatic sum-
maries were obtained using all of the summa-
rization strategies applicable, based on linguis-
tic information (lexical, structural, etc.), on e-
mail specific information (appointment, attach-
ment, etc.) in both (textual and documental) or
applying baseline strategies, like having the first
line or paragraph as the summary.
Human and automatic summaries were com-
pared by lc agreement and by precision at dis-
course unit level. Agreement between human
and automatic summaries was very low in terms
of lc (average ic = .02), but evaluation met-
rics more usual for summarization, like preci-
sion with respect to human summaries, reached
60% average, which is the state of the art for
automatic text summarization.
Results show that simple methods, like taking
the first line of the e-mail (lead) offer very good
results, but, in general, summaries exploiting e-
mail specific knowledge (list, appointment) can
improve on this baseline. However, these kinds
of e-mail present very low coverage. The strat-
egy combining general linguistic and e-mail spe-
cific knowledge (textual and documental) yields
a good balance between coverage and precision.
Finally, results concerning the chosen sum-
mary show that there is still room for im-
provement within the classification module,
since most of the alternative summaries present
higher precision rates than the chosen one.

<bodyText confidence="0.999995">
We have presented CARPANTA, an e-mail sum-
marization system that applies a knowledge-
intensive approach to obtain highly coherent
summaries, targeted to guarantee understand-
ability in delivery by phone. Results indicate
that the classification module has to be im-
proved. Given the highly modular architecture
of CARPANTA, adaptation to other languages
has a very low cost of development, provided
the required NLP tools are available.
