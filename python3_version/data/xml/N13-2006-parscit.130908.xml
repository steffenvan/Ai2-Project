Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999605357142857">
Our research investigates the translation of on-
tology labels, which has applications in mul-
tilingual knowledge access. Ontologies are
often defined only in one language, mostly
English. To enable knowledge access across
languages, such monolingual ontologies need
to be translated into other languages. The
primary challenge in ontology label trans-
lation is the lack of context, which makes
this task rather different than document trans-
lation. The core objective therefore, is to
provide statistical machine translation (SMT)
systems with additional context information.
In our approach, we first extend standard SMT
by enhancing a translation model with context
information that keeps track of surrounding
words for each translation. We compute a se-
mantic similarity between the phrase pair con-
text vector from the parallel corpus and a vec-
tor of noun phrases that occur in surrounding
ontology labels. We applied our approach to
the translation of a financial ontology, translat-
ing from English to German, using Europarl as
parallel corpus. This experiment showed that
our approach can provide a slight improve-
ment over standard SMT for this task, with-
out exploiting any additional domain-specific
resources.

The biggest barrier for EU-wide cross-lingual busi-

guages used by banks or investment firms for their
financial reports. In contrast to that, most of the

in English, e.g. the financial ontology FINREP1
(FINancial REPorting) or COREP2 (COmmon sol-
vency ratio REPorting). To make the targeted trans-
parency of financial information possible, these on-
tologies have to be translated first into another lan-
guage; see also (Declerck et al., 2010). The chal-
lenge here lies in translating domain-specific on-
tology vocabulary, e.g. Equity-equivalent partner
loans, Subordinated capital or Write-downs of long-
term financial assets and securities.
Since domain-specific parallel corpora for SMT
are hardly available, we used a large general parallel
corpus, whereby a translation model built by such
a resource will tend to translate a segment into the
most common word sense. This can be seen for in-
stance when we translate the financial ontology label
Equity-equivalent partner loans from the German
GAAP ontology (cf. Section 3.1). Using a baseline
SMT system we get the translation Gerechtigkeit-
gleichwertige Partner Darlehen. Although this la-
bel provides contextual information, equity is trans-
lated into its general meaning, i.e. Gerechtigkeit in
the meaning of justice, righteousness or fairness, al-
though Eigenkapital would be the preferred transla-
tion in the financial domain.
To achieve accurate disambiguation we developed
a method using context vectors. We extract semantic
information from the ontology, i.e. the vocabulary
and relations between labels and compare it with the
contextual information extracted from a parallel cor-
pus.

Word sense disambiguation (WSD) systems gener-
ally perform on the word level, for an input word
they generate the most probable meaning. On the
other hand, state of the art translation systems op-
erate on sequences of words. This discrepancy be-
tween unigrams versus n-grams was first described
in (Carpuat and Wu, 2005). Likewise, (Apidianaki
et al., 2012) use a WSD classifier to generate a prob-
ability distribution of phrase pairs and to build a lo-
cal language model. They show that the classifier
does not only improve the translation of ambiguous
words, but also the translation of neighbour words.
We investigate this discrepancy as part of our re-
search in enriching the ontology label translation
with ontological information. Similar to their work
we incorporate the idea of enriching the translation
model with neighbour words information, whereby
we extend the window to 5-grams.
(Mauser et al., 2009) generate a lexicon that pre-
dicts the bag of output words from the bag of input
words. In their research, no alignment between input
and output words is used, words are chosen based
on the input context. The word predictions of the in-
put sentences are considered as an additional feature
that is used in the decoding process. This feature de-
fines a new probability score that favours the trans-
lation hypothesis containing words, which were pre-
dicted by the lexicon model. Similarly, (Patry and
Langlais, 2011) train a model by translating a bag-
of-words. In contrast to their work, our approach
uses bag-of-word information to enrich the missing
contextual information that arises from translating
ontology labels in isolation.
(McCrae et al., 2011) exploit in their research
the ontology structure for translation of ontologies
and taxonomies. They compare the structure of
the monolingual ontology to the structure of already
translated multilingual ontologies, where the source
and target labels are used for the disambiguation
process of phrase pairs. We incorporated the idea of
using the ontology structure, but avoided the draw-
back of exploiting existing domain-specific multilin-
gual ontologies.

As a baseline approach we used the Europarl par-

the English-German parallel corpus with around 1.9
million aligned sentences and 40 million English
and 43 million German tokens (Koehn, 2005).
Although previous research showed that a trans-
lation model built by using a general parallel cor-
pus cannot be used for domain-specific vocabulary
translation (Wu et al., 2008), we decided to train a
baseline translation model on this general corpus to
illustrate any improvement steps gained by enrich-

it still contains 2,394,513 phrase pairs. Due to the

scalability issue, we reduced the number of phrase
pairs by filtering the sub-phrase table based on the
following criteria:
a) the direct phrase translation probability φ(e|f)
has to be larger than 0.0001
b) a phrase pair should not start or end with a
functional word, i.e. prepositions, conjunctions,
modal verbs, pronouns
c) a phrase pair should not start with punctuation
After applying these criteria to the sub-phrase ta-
ble, the new filtered phrase table holds 53,283 enti-
In the next step, the phrase pairs stored in the fil-
tered phrase table were used to find sentences in Eu-
roparl, where these phrase pairs appear. The goal
was to extract the surrounding words as the con-
textual information of these phrase pairs. If a seg-
ment from the filtered phrase table appeared in the
sentence we extracted the lemmatised contextual in-
formation of the phrase pair, whereby we consid-
ered 10 tokens to the left and 10 to the right of
the analysed phrase pair. To address the problem
of different inflected forms (financial asset vs. fi-
nancial assets) of the same lexical entity (financial
asset) we lemmatised the English part of the Eu-
roparl corpus with TreeTagger(Schmid, 1995). Sim-
ilar to the phrase table filtering approach, an n-gram
should not start with a functional word or punctua-
tion. The extracted surrounding words were stored
together with its phrase pairs, i.e. for the phrase
pairs Equity-Gerechtigkeit and Equity-Eigenkapital
different contextual vectors were generated.
Example 1.a) illustrates a sentence, which holds
the source segment Equity from the filtered phrase
table. Example 1.b) represents its translation into
German. This example illustrates the context in
which Equity is translated into the German expres-
sion Gerechtigkeit. The segment Equity is also
present in the second sentence, (example 2.a)), in
contrast to the first one, equity is translated into
Eigenkapital, (2.b)), since the sentence reports fi-
nancial information.

To compare the contextual information extracted
from Europarl a similar approach was applied to the
vocabulary in the German GAAP ontology.
First, to avoid unnecessary segments, e.g. provi-
sions for or losses from executory, we parsed the fi-
nancial ontology with the Stanford parser (Klein and
Manning, 2003) and extracted meaningful segments
from the ontology labels. This step was done pri-
marily to avoid comparing all possible n-gram seg-
ments with the filtered segments extracted from the
Europarl corpus (cf. Subsection 4.2). With the syn-
tactical information given by the Stanford parser we
extracted a set of noun segments for the ontology la-
bels, which we defined by the rules shown in Table

the Cosine measure using frequencies (rv) performs
best for the METEOR metric. On the other hand the

Table 7 illustrates the different approaches that were
performed in our research. As the automatic metrics
give just a slight intuition about the improvements of
the different approaches, we compared the transla-
tions of the general translation model manually with
the translations on which Jaccard similarity coeffi-
cient was performed.
As discussed, Equity can be translated into Ger-
man as Gerechtigkeit when translating it in a gen-
eral domain or into Eigenkapital when translat-
ing it in the financial domain. In the financial
ontology, the segment Equity appears 126 times.
The general translation model translates it wrongly
as Gerechtigkeit, whereby the Jaccard coefficient,
with the help of contextual information, favours
the preferred translation Eigenkapital. Further-
more Equit can be also part of a larger financial
label, e.g. Equity-equivalent partner loans, but
the general translation model still translates it into
Gerechtigkeit. This can be explained by the seg-
mentation during the decoding process, i.e. the SMT
system tokenises this label into separate tokens and
translates each token separately from each other. On
the contrary, the Jaccard similarity coefficient cor-
rects the unigram segment to Eigenkapital.
As part of the label Uncalled unpaid contributions
to subscribed capital (deducted from equity on the
face of the balance sheet), equity is again translated
by the general translation model as Gerechtigkeit. In
this case the Jaccard coefficient cannot correct the
translation, which is caused by the general model
itself, since in all n-best (n=50) translations equity is
translated as Gerechtigkeit. In this case the Jaccard
coefficient reordering does not have any affect.
The manual analysis further showed that the am-
biguous ontology label Securities, e.g. in Write-
downs of long-term financial assets and securities
was also often translated as Sicherheiten7 in the
meaning of certainties or safeties, but was corrected
by the Jaccard coefficient into Wertpapiere, which is
the correct translation in the financial domain.
Finally, the analysis showed that the segment Bal-
ance in Central bank balances was often trans-
lated by the baseline model into Gleichgewichte,8
i.e. Zentralbank Gleichgewichte, whereas the Jac-
card coefficient favoured the preferred translation
Guthaben, i.e. Zentralbank Bankguthaben.

Conclusion and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999981217391305">
Our approach to re-using existing resources showed
slight improvements in the translation quality of the
financial vocabulary. Although the contextual infor-
mation favoured correct translations in the financial
domain, we see a need for more research on the con-
textual information stored in the parallel corpus and
also in the ontology. Also more work has to be done
on analysis of the overlap of the contextual informa-
tion and the ontology vocabulary, e.g. which con-
textual words should have more weight for the simi-
larity measure. Furthermore, dealing with the ontol-
ogy structure, the relations between the labels, i.e.
part-of and parent-child relations, have to be consid-
ered. Once these questions are answered, the next
step will be to compare the classical cosine mea-
sure against more sophisticated similarity measures,
i.e. Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA) (Gabrilovich
and Markovitch, 2007). Instead of measuring simi-
larity between the vectors directly using cosine, we
will investigate the application of ESA to calculate
the similarities between short texts by taking their
linguistic variations into account (Aggarwal et al.,
2012).

<abstract confidence="0.997503241379311">Our research investigates the translation of ontology labels, which has applications in multilingual knowledge access. Ontologies are often defined only in one language, mostly English. To enable knowledge access across languages, such monolingual ontologies need to be translated into other languages. The primary challenge in ontology label translation is the lack of context, which makes this task rather different than document translation. The core objective therefore, is to provide statistical machine translation (SMT) systems with additional context information. In our approach, we first extend standard SMT by enhancing a translation model with context information that keeps track of surrounding words for each translation. We compute a semantic similarity between the phrase pair context vector from the parallel corpus and a vector of noun phrases that occur in surrounding ontology labels. We applied our approach to the translation of a financial ontology, translating from English to German, using Europarl as parallel corpus. This experiment showed that our approach can provide a slight improvement over standard SMT for this task, without exploiting any additional domain-specific resources.</abstract>

Also more work has to be done on analysis of the overlap of the contextual information and the ontology vocabulary, e.g. which contextual words should have more weight for the similarity measure. Furthermore, dealing with the ontology structure, the relations between the labels, i.e. part-of and parent-child relations, have to be considered. Once these questions are answered, the next step will be to compare the classical cosine measure against more sophisticated similarity measures, i.e. Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA) (Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007). Instead of measuring similarity between the vectors directly using cosine, we will investigate the application of ESA to calculate the similarities between short texts by taking their linguistic variations into account (Aggarwal et al., 2012).

First, to avoid unnecessary segments, e.g. provisions for or losses from executory, we parsed the financial ontology with the Stanford parser (Klein and Manning, 2003) and extracted meaningful segments from the ontology labels. This step was done primarily to avoid comparing all possible n-gram segments with the filtered segments extracted from the Europarl corpus (cf. Subsection 4.2). With the syntactical information given by the Stanford parser we extracted a set of noun segments for the ontology labels, which we defined by the rules shown in Table 2. # Syntactic Patterns 1 (NN(S) w+) 2 (NP (NN(S) w+)+)) 3 (NP (JJ w+)+ (NN(S) w+)+)) 4 (NP (NN(S) w+)+ (CC w+) (NN(S) w+)+) 5 (NP (NN(S) w+)+ (PP (IN/.. w+) (NP (NN(S) w+)+)) Table 2: Syntactic patterns for ex</context>

A similar approach was done with the ontology structure and vocabulary (Section 4.3). 4.1 Moses toolkit To translate the English financial labels into German, we used the statistical translation toolkit Moses (Koehn et al., 2007), where the word alignments were built with the GIZA++ toolkit (Och and Ney, 2003). The SRILM toolkit (Stolcke, 2002) was used to build the 5-gram language model. 4.2 Building the contextual-semantic resource from the parallel corpus Europarl To enhance the baseline approach with additional semantic information, we built a new resource of contextual information from Europarl.

The word predictions of the input sentences are considered as an additional feature that is used in the decoding process. This feature defines a new probability score that favours the translation hypothesis containing words, which were predicted by the lexicon model. Similarly, (Patry and Langlais, 2011) train a model by translating a bagof-words. In contrast to their work, our approach uses bag-of-word information to enrich the missing contextual information that arises from translating ontology labels in isolation. (McCrae et al., 2011) exploit in their research the ontology structure for translation of ontologies and taxonomies. They compare the structure of the monolingual ontology to the structure of already translated multilingual ontologies, where the source and target labels are used for the disambiguation process of phrase pairs. We incorporated the idea of using the ontology structure, but avoided the drawback of exploiting existing domain-specific multilingual ontologies. 3 Data sets For our experiment we used a general parallel corpus to generate the mandatory SMT phrase table and language model.

The goal was to extract the surrounding words as the contextual information of these phrase pairs. If a segment from the filtered phrase table appeared in the sentence we extracted the lemmatised contextual information of the phrase pair, whereby we considered 10 tokens to the left and 10 to the right of the analysed phrase pair. To address the problem of different inflected forms (financial asset vs. financial assets) of the same lexical entity (financial asset) we lemmatised the English part of the Europarl corpus with TreeTagger(Schmid, 1995). Similar to the phrase table filtering approach, an n-gram should not start with a functional word or punctuation. The extracted surrounding words were stored together with its phrase pairs, i.e. for the phrase pairs Equity-Gerechtigkeit and Equity-Eigenkapital different contextual vectors were generated. Example 1.a) illustrates a sentence, which holds the source segment Equity from the filtered phrase table. Example 1.b) represents its translation into German. This example illustrates the context in which Equity is translated into the German expression Gerechtigkeit. The segment Equity is a</context>

We used the English-German parallel corpus with around 1.9 million aligned sentences and 40 million English and 43 million German tokens (Koehn, 2005). Although previous research showed that a translation model built by using a general parallel corpus cannot be used for domain-specific vocabulary translation (Wu et al., 2008), we decided to train a baseline translation model on this general corpus to illustrate any improvement steps gained by enriching the standard approach with the semantic information of the ontology vocabulary and structure. 4 Experiment Since ontology labels (or label segments) translated by the Moses toolkit (Section 4.1) do not have much contextual information, we addressed this lack of information and generated fromthe Europarl corpus a new resource with contextual information of surrounding words as feature vectors (Section 4.2).
