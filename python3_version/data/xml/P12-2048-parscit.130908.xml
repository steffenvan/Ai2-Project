This paper presents the problem within Hit-
tite and Ancient Near Eastern studies of frag-
mented and damaged cuneiform texts, and
proposes to use well-known text classification
metrics, in combination with some facts about
the structure of Hittite-language cuneiform
texts, to help classify a number of fragments of
clay cuneiform-script tablets into more com-
plete texts. In particular, I propose using
Sumerian and Akkadian ideogrammatic signs
within Hittite texts to improve the perfor-
mance of Naive Bayes and Maximum Entropy
classifiers. The performance in some cases
is improved, and in some cases very much
not, suggesting that the variable frequency of
occurrence of these ideograms in individual
fragments makes considerable difference in
the ideal choice for a classification method.
Further, complexities of the writing system
and the digital availability of Hittite texts com-
plicate the problem.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999923625">
The Hittite empire, in existence for about 600 years
between 1800 and 1200 BCE, left numerous histori-
cal, political, and literary documents behind, written
in cuneiform in clay tablets. There are a number of
common problems that confront Hittite scholars in-
terested in any subdiscipline of Hittitology, be it his-
tory, philology, or linguistics. Horst Klengel sum-
marizes the issue most crucial to this paper:
Some general problems, affecting both
philologists and historians, are caused by
the Hittite textual tradition itself. First,
the bulk of the cuneiform material is frag-
mentary. The tablets, discovered in var-
ious depots in the Hittite capital and in
some provincial centers, normally were of
a larger size. When the archives were de-
stroyed, the tablets for the most part broke
into many pieces. Therefore, the joining
of fragments became an important prereq-
uisite for interpretation(Klengel, 2002).
Most Hittite texts are broken, but a number exist
in more than one fragmentary copy.
Figure 1 shows a photograph, taken from the
University of Meinz Konkordanz der hethitischen
Texte1, of a typical Hittite cuneiform fragment.
Complete or partially-complete texts are assem-
bled from collections of fragments based on shape,
writing size and style, and sentence similarity. Joins
between fragments are not made systematically, but
are usually discovered by scholars assembling large
numbers of fragments that reference a specific sub-
ject, like some joins recently made in Hittite treaty
documents in (Beckman, 1997).
Joins are thus fairly rare compared to the fre-
quency of new publishing of fragments. Such joins
and the larger texts created therewith are catalogued
according to a CTH (Catalogue des Textes Hittites2)
number. Each individual text is composed of one or
more cuneiform fragments belonging to one or more
copies of a single original work.

Figure 2 shows a published join in hand-copied
cuneiform fragments. In this case, the fragments are
not contiguous, and only the text on the two frag-
ments was used to make the join.
The task then, for the purposes of this paper, is
to connect unknown fragments of Hittite cuneiform
tablets with larger texts. I’m viewing this as a text
classification task, where larger, CTH-numbered
texts are the categories, and small fragments are the
bits of text to be assigned to these categories.

2 The Corpus of Hittite
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999932705882353">
Hittite cuneiform consists of a mix of syllabic writ-
ing for Hittite words and logographic writing, typ-
ically Sumerian ideograms, standing in for Hittite
words. Most words are written out phonologically
using syllabic signs, in structure mostly CV and VC,
and a few CVC. Some common words are written
with logograms from other Ancient Near Eastern
languages, e.g. Hittite antuhˇsa- ‘man’ is commonly
written with the Sumerian-language logogram tran-
scribed L ´U. Such writings are called Sumerograms
or Akkadograms, depending on the language from
which the ideogram is taken.
The extant corpus of Hittite consists of more than
30,000 clay tablets and fragments excavated at sites
in Turkey, Syria, and Egypt (Hoffner and Melchert,
2008, 2-3). Many of these fragments are assigned to
one of the 835 texts catalogued in the CTH.

3 Prior Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9955978125">
A large number of prior studies on text classifica-
tion have informed the progress of this study. Cat-
egorization of texts into genres is very well studied
(Dewdney et al., 2001). Other related text classi-
fication studies have looked at classifying text by
source, in contexts of speech, as in an attempt to
classify some segments of speech into native and
non-native speaker categories (Tomokiyo and Jones,
2001), and writing and authorship, as in the fa-
mous Federalist Papers study(Mosteller and Wal-
lace, 1984), and context, as in a categorization of
a set of articles according to which newspaper they
appeared in (Argamon-Engelson et al., 1998).
Measures of similarity among sections of a single
document bear a closer relation to this project than
the works above. Previous studies have examined in-

ternal document similarity, using some vector-based
metrics to judge whether documents maintain the
same subject throughout (Nicholson, 2009).
Very little computational work on cuneiform lan-
guages or texts exists. The most notable example
is a study that examined grapheme distribution as
a way to understand Hurrian substratal interference
in the orthography of Akkadian-language cuneiform
texts written in the Hurrian-speaking town of Nuzi
(Smith, 2007). Smith’s work, though using different
classifying methods and and an enormously differ-
ent corpus on a language with different characteris-
tics, is the most similar to this study, since both are
attempts to classify cuneiform fragments into cat-
egories - in Smith’s case, into Hurrian-influenced
Nuzi Akkadian and non-Nuzi standard Akkadian.

4 The Project Corpus
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999980333333333">
For this project, I use a corpus of neo-Hittite
fragment transcriptions available from H. Craig
Melchert (Melchert, ). The corpus is one large text
file, divided into CTH numbered sections, which
themselves are divided into fragments labeled by
their publication numbers - mostly KUB, which
stands for Keilschrifturkunden aus Boghazk¨oi or
KBo, Keilschrifttexte aus Boghazk¨oi, the two major
publications for Hittite text fragments.
I restricted the fragments used in this project to
fragments belonging to texts known to exist in at
least two copies, a choice that produces a larger
number of fragments per text without requiring a
judgment about what number of fragments in a text
constitutes “fragmented enough” for a legitimate test
of this task. This leaves 36 total CTH-numbered
texts, consisting of 389 total fragments.
The fragments themselves are included as plain
text, with restorations by the transcribers left intact
and set off by brackets, in the manner typical of
cuneiform transcription. In transcription, signs with
phonemic value are written in lower case characters,
while ideograms are represented in all caps. Sign
boundaries are represented by a hyphen, indicating
the next sign is part of the current word, by an equals
sign, indicating the next sign is a clitic, or a space,
indicating that the next sign is part of a new word.

This fragment, KUB XXI25, is very small and
broken on both sides. The areas between brackets
are sections of the text broken off or effaced by ero-
sion of tablet surface material. Any text present be-
tween brackets has been inferred from context and
transcriber experience with usual phrasing in Hittite.
In the last line, the sign EGIR, a Sumerian ideogram,
which is split by a bracket, was partially effaced but
still recognizable to the transcriber, and so is split by
a bracket.

5 Methods
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999971235294118">
For this project, I used both Naive Bayes and Max-
imum Entropy classifiers as implemented by the
MAchine Learning for LanguagE Toolkit, MAL-
LET(McCallum, 2002).
Two copies of the corpus were prepared. In
one, anything in brackets or partially remaining after
brackets was removed, leaving only characters actu-
ally preserved on the fragment. This copy is called
Plain Cuneiform in the results section. The other
has all bracket characters removed, leaving all actual
characters and all characters suggested by the tran-
scribers. This corpus is called Brackets Removed in
the results section. By removing the brackets but
leaving the suggested characters, I hoped to use the
transcribers’ intuitions about Hittite texts to further
improve the performance of both classifiers.
The corpora were tokenized in two ways:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.908844">
1. The tokens were defined only by spaces, cap-
turing all words in the corpus.
2. The tokens were defined as a series of capital
letters and punctuation marks, capturing only
the Sumerian and Akkadian ideograms in the
text, i.e. the very common Sumerian ideogram
DINGER.MEˇS, ‘the gods’.

6 Results and Discussion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99994306122449">
Accuracy values from the classifiers using the Plain
corpus, and from the corpus with the Brackets Re-
moved, are presented in Tables 1 and 2, respec-
tively. The measures are raw accuracy, the fraction
of the test fragments that the methods categorized
correctly.
The results for the Plain Corpus show that the
Naive Bayes classifier was 55% accurate with all to-
kens, and 44% accurate with ideograms alone. The
Maximum Entropy classifier was 61% accurate with
all tokens, and 51% accurate with ideograms only.
Both classifiers performed better with the Brack-
ets Removed corpus. The Naive Bayes classifier was
accurate 64% of the time with all tokens and 49% of
the time with ideograms only. The Maximum En-
tropy classifier was 67% accurate with all tokens,
and 54% accurate with ideograms only.
The predicted increase in accuracy using
ideograms was not upheld by the above tests. It may
be the case that Sumerograms and Akkadograms
are insufficiently frequent, particularly in smaller
fragments, to allow for correct categorization.
Some early tests suggested occasional excellent
results for this tokenization scheme, including a
single random 90-10 training/test run that showed
a test accuracy of .86, much higher than any larger
cross-validated test included above. This suggests,
perhaps unsurprisingly, that the accuracy of classi-
fication using Sumerograms and Akkadograms is
heavily dependent on the structure of the fragments
in question.
Maximum Entropy classification proved to be
slightly better, in every instance, than Naive Bayes
classification, a fact that will prove useful in future
tests and applications.
The fact that removing the brackets and includ-
ing the transcribers’ additions improved the perfor-
mance of all classifiers will likewise prove useful,
since transcriptions of fragments are typically pub-
lished with such bracketed additions. It also seems
to demonstrate the quality of these additions made
by transcribers.
Overall, these tests suggest that in general, the
‘use-everything’ approach is better for accurate clas-
sification of Hittite tablet fragments with larger CTH
texts. However, in some cases, when the fragments
in question have a large number of Sumerograms
and Akkadograms, using them exclusively may be
the right choice.

7 Implications and Further Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998147826087">
In the future, I hope to continue with a number of
other approaches to this problem, including lemma-
tizing the various Hittite noun and verb paradigms.
Additionally, viewing the problem in other ways,
e.g. regarding tablet fragments as elements for con-
nection by clustering algorithms, might work well.
Given the large number of small fragments now
coming to light, this method could speed the pro-
cess of text assembly considerably. A new set of
archives, recently discovered in the Hittite city of
ˇSapinuwa, are only now beginning to see publica-
tion. This site contains more than 3000 new Hit-
tite tablet fragments, with excavations ongoing(S¨uel,
2002). The jumbled nature of the dig site means that
the process of assembling new texts from this site
will be one of the major tasks in for Hittite schol-
ars in the near future. This attempt at speeding the
task is only the beginning of what I hope will be a
considerable body of work to help build more com-
plete texts, and therefore more complete literatures
and histories, of not only Hittite, but other cuneiform
languages like Akkadian and Sumerian, some of the
world’s earliest written languages.

Horst Klengel summarizes the issue most crucial to this paper: Some general problems, affecting both philologists and historians, are caused by the Hittite textual tradition itself. First, the bulk of the cuneiform material is fragmentary. The tablets, discovered in various depots in the Hittite capital and in some provincial centers, normally were of a larger size. When the archives were destroyed, the tablets for the most part broke into many pieces. Therefore, the joining of fragments became an important prerequisite for interpretation(Klengel, 2002). Most Hittite texts are broken, but a number exist in more than one fragmentary copy. Figure 1 shows a photograph, taken from the University of Meinz Konkordanz der hethitischen Texte1, of a typical Hittite cuneiform fragment. Complete or partially-complete texts are assembled from collections of fragments based on shape, writing size and style, and sentence similarity. Joins between fragments are not made systematically, but are usually discovered by scholars assembling large numbers of fragments that reference a specific subject, like some joins recently made in Hittite treaty documents in </context>

The areas between brackets are sections of the text broken off or effaced by erosion of tablet surface material. Any text present between brackets has been inferred from context and transcriber experience with usual phrasing in Hittite. In the last line, the sign EGIR, a Sumerian ideogram, which is split by a bracket, was partially effaced but still recognizable to the transcriber, and so is split by a bracket. 5 Methods For this project, I used both Naive Bayes and Maximum Entropy classifiers as implemented by the MAchine Learning for LanguagE Toolkit, MALLET(McCallum, 2002). Two copies of the corpus were prepared. In one, anything in brackets or partially remaining after brackets was removed, leaving only characters actually preserved on the fragment. This copy is called Plain Cuneiform in the results section. The other has all bracket characters removed, leaving all actual characters and all characters suggested by the transcribers. This corpus is called Brackets Removed in the results section. By removing the brackets but leaving the suggested characters, I hoped to use the transcribers’ intuitions about Hittite texts to further improve the performance of both</context>

Many of these fragments are assigned to one of the 835 texts catalogued in the CTH. 3 Prior Work A large number of prior studies on text classification have informed the progress of this study. Categorization of texts into genres is very well studied (Dewdney et al., 2001). Other related text classification studies have looked at classifying text by source, in contexts of speech, as in an attempt to classify some segments of speech into native and non-native speaker categories (Tomokiyo and Jones, 2001), and writing and authorship, as in the famous Federalist Papers study(Mosteller and Wallace, 1984), and context, as in a categorization of a set of articles according to which newspaper they appeared in (Argamon-Engelson et al., 1998). Measures of similarity among sections of a single document bear a closer relation to this project than the works above. Previous studies have examined inFigure 1: Photograph of a Hittite Tablet Fragment Figure 2: Published Fragment Join 244 ternal document similarity, using some vector-based metrics to judge whether documents maintain the same subject throughout (Nicholson, 2009).
