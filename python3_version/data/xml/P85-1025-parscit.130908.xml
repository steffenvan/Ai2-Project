In this paper we examine the pragmatic knowledge an
utterance-planning system must have in order to produce
certain kinds of definite and indefinite noun phrases. An
utterance-planning system, like other planning systems,
plans actions to satisfy an agent&apos;s goals, but allows some
of the actions to consist of the utterance of sentences. This
approach to language generation emphasizes the view of
language as action, and hence assigns a critical role to prag-
matics.
The noun phrases under consideration in this paper are
those that presuppose the existence of an individual that
could be described by the description D. In other words,
when a speaker uses a noun phrase with description 0, it
makes sense to ask the question &amp;quot;Which x is D?&amp;quot; This cri-
terion includes more than strictly referential uses of noun
phrases, because it is not necessary for the speaker or hearer
to know what individual is described by D — it is merely
necessary that the existence of such an individual is pre-
supposed. Consider the attributive description in sentence
(1):
The runner who wins tomorrow&apos;s race will qualify
for the semifinals.
The description &amp;quot;runner who wins tomorrow&apos;s race&amp;quot; cannot
be referential, because, under ordinary circumstances, the
speaker could not possibly know who it is that would fit the
description. Nevertheless, it is still reasonable to ask which
runner will win tomorrow&apos;s race, because the description is
objectively true of some individual.
This qualification excludes noun phrases whose referents
are bound within the scope of a universal quantifier, such
as &amp;quot;the woman ...&amp;quot; in
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.703408">
(2) Every man wants to meet the woman of his dreams.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.985514">
For a similar reason, indefinites within the scope of a sen-
tential negation are excluded because they introduce an
existential quantifier, which, under the scope of negation,
is really a universal quantifier. Therefore, &amp;quot;a screwdriver&amp;quot;
in
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.803501666666667">
(3) John does not have a screwdriver.
is excluded because, under most circumstances of its use,
there is no screwdriver that the description in sentence (3)
denotes. Predicate nominals are excluded, as in the sen-
tence
(4) John wants to be a doctor.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.987139470588235">
because one would not ask the question &amp;quot;Which doctor does
John want to be?&amp;quot;
The choice of this particular class of noun phrases is mo-
tivated by considerations relevant to planning. When a
speaker communicates with a hearer, he often intends the
hearer to hold some attitudes toward individuals in the do-
main. This is particularly true in task-oriented dialogues
where the hearer may have to locate and manipulate things
in his environment.
The theory of utterance planning assumed for the pur-
pose of this analysis is the one embodied in KAMP (Ap-
pelt, 1985). Individuals are represented by terms in an
intensional logic of knowledge and action. A metalanguage
is used to axiomatize the relationship that holds between
the terms and the individuals they denote. The terms can
consist of predicates co:nbined with an iota operator, as in
ix D(x), where
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.2994">
D(x) Di(x) A . . . A D„(x).
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.998344909090909">
The predicates Di are called descriptors. and their conjunc-
tion. 0, is called a description. Because most noun phrases
employ terms that are constructed from a description, often
the words &amp;quot;term&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;description&amp;quot; are used interchange-
ably.
The propositional content of the speaker&apos;s utterance is
represented by a sentence in the intensional logic involving
the terms discussed above. littering a sentence entails per-
forming a number of actions, called concept activation ac-
tions, which result in the terms constituting the proposition
receiving a special status called &amp;quot;active.&apos; The proposition

that the speaker intends to convey is a predication involv-
ing the active terms. Referring is a particular type of con-
cept activation action with relatively strict conditions on
what must be mutually believed by the speaker and hearer
for the action to succeed. Searle (1969) presents an anal-
ysis of referring as a speech act and dismisses many uses
of noun phrases as nonreferring. Such nonreferring noun
phrases occur very frequently, and the considerations that
underly their planning share much in common with those
that underly actual referring. Therefore, the concept acti-
vation action provides a suitable generalization that allows
a plan-based treatment of many more uses of noun phrases.

2 Research Objectives
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99960462">
The analysis presented in this paper represents one of the
first steps toward a plan-based account of definite and in-
definite noun phrases. Ideally, such an account would (1)
provide a semantics for noun phrases, (2) define an actions
like &amp;quot;uttering a definite noun phrase,&amp;quot; and (3) provide an
analysis that shows how the speaker&apos;s intentions follow di-
rectly from the semantics of the noun phrase he utters,
plus conditions on mutual knowledge and general princi-
ples of rationality. This program is very much in the spirit
of the analysis of illocutionary acts provided by Cohen and
Levesque (1980), who demonstrate how illocutionary acts
can be defined in terms of the kinds of inferences made,
given a semantic analysis of an utterance, facts about mu-
tual knowledge, and general principles of rational behavior.
Cohen (1984) provided such an analysis for referring ac-
tions by postulating a semantics for the definite determiner
that would give the semantics of a definite noun phrase as
a request to identify the referent of a description. This
analysis would be impossible to extend to the more gen-
eral concept activation actions, because, in some cases, the
speaker intends that the hearer not identify the denota-
tion of the description, even when a definite noun phrase is
used. A complete analysis along these lines that subsumes
both referring and nonreferring noun phrases has yet to be
worked out.
As an intermediate step toward this ultimate goal, we
shall propose a taxonomy of concept activation actions that
convey the various intentions a speaker may have with re-
spect to a hearer and a description. This taxonomy is of
theoretical interest, because it characterizes differences and
similarities among uses of noun phrases that current theo-
ries do not characterize. It is also of practical interest for
utterance planning, because the set of actions to be pro-
posed provides a useful level of abstraction for the reason-
ing processes of an utterance-planning system. For exam-
ple, certain planning strategies such as action subsumption
(Appelt. 1985) are applicable only to certain kinds of con-
cept activation actions and not to others. Therefore, even if
the complete plan-based analysis of noun phrases is worked
out, the taxonomy of actions presented here will still be of
practical importance.
Until an analysis like Cohen and Levesque&apos;s is worked
out, the concept activation actions here will be treated like
illocutionary acts in a speech-act theory. When a hearer
understands an utterance, he reasons about whether it con-
stitutes an assertion, a request, a warning, etc. Therefore,
understanding one of the definite or indefinite noun phrases
under consideration in this paper is assumed to entail recog-
nition of what concept activation action the speaker intends
to perform.

3 Summary of Actions Underlying
Noun Phrases
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99997485">
There are many distinctions that one could draw between
noun phrases, only some of which are relevant to planning.
For example, one could distinguish noun phrases that refer
to amorphous substances from those that refer to discrete
entities. Such a distinction may have some valid motiva-
tion, but it is not necessarily so from the standpoint of
planning. It would be well motivated only if there were
a clear difference in the preconditions and effects of the
concept activation actions-underlying mass terms, or in the
strategy for the selection of descriptors. This does not seem
to be the case for mass versus discrete entities.
However, there are two criteria that clearly affect the rel-
evant preconditions, intended effects, and planning strate-
gies of concept activation actions: (1) whether the speaker
intends that the bearer identify the denotation of the de-
scription, and (2) how much mutual knowledge the speaker
and hearer share about the description&apos;s denotation. The
first criterion is what (roughly) distinguishes referring noun
phrases from nonreferring noun phrases. The necessity of
the hearer performing the identification constrains the de-
scription to be one that facilitates the hearer&apos;s formulation
of a plan to do so.
The second criterion is the knowledge that is shared
by the speaker and the hearer at the time of the utter-
ance. Planning strategies are influenced by whether or not
the speaker and hearer mutually believe appropriate facts
about the intended referent. In particular, if the speaker
and hearer share enough knowledge about the descriptions
denotation and the contextual situation. it may be possible
for the hearer to recognize the speaker&apos;s intentions using
only a subset of the descriptors in the noun phrase&apos;s de-
scription. In such a situation, the speaker can augment
the description with additional descriptors for the purpose
of informing the hearer that they are trite of the denota-
tion of the other part of the description. Such a strategy is
called action eubsumption, (Appeit, 1985). The action sub-
gumption strategy cannot be used with concept activation
actions that are not based on shared knowledge.
Since there are two dimensions relevant to characteriz-
ing concept activation actions, it is possible to define four

actions, as illustrated in Figure 1. These actions are SI
(shared concept activation with identification intention),
NSI (nonshared concept activation with identification in-
tention), SNI (shared concept activation with no identifi-
cation intention), and NSNI (nonshared concept activation
with no identification intention.) Each action has distinct
preconditions, effects, and an assocated planning strategy.

4 Mutual Knowledge and
Identification
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997258525641026">
The two most important considerations in planning con-
cept activation actions are (1) whether or not the speaker
intends the hearer to identify the referent of the description
and (2) what knowledge about the description&apos;s possible de-
notations the speaker and hearer share.
What it means for an agent to &amp;quot;identify&amp;quot; the referent of
a description is a topic of considerable conplexity. Searle
(1969) states that &amp;quot;So identification ... rests squarely on
the speaker&apos;s ability to supply an expression ... which is
satisfied uniquely by the object to which he intends to re-
fer.&amp;quot; What counts as an identifying description depends on
the purpose for which the agent is identifying the descrip-
tion&apos;s denotation. For example, the description that one
must know to carry out a plan requiring the identification
of &apos;John&apos;s residence&amp;quot; may be quite different depending on
whether one is going to visit him, or mail him a letter. If I
want to speak to a guest at a Halloween party, I need only
a description capable of distinguishing him from the other
guests at the party, not to know who it really is wearing
the disguise.
Identification of the denotation of a term D is therefore
defined as finding another term D&apos; (called a prima facie
(PF) identifiable term) that has the same denotation as D
according to the hearer&apos;s knowledge, but that meets certain
syntactic criteria for being the &apos;right kind&amp;quot; of term. It is
stipulated that any two distinct PF identifiable terms must
denote different individuals in the same situation. The sim-
plest criterion for PF identifiability that meets this require-
ment is that the term be a standard name. Because each
standard name denotes the same individual in any context,
knowing that a particular standard name is equivalent to
a term implies that the agent knows the denotation of the
term. Furthermore, any two distinct standard names de-
note different individuals.
The standard name approach was taken by the KAMP
system. The standard name assumption has two difficul-
ties. First, it is extremely implausible to believe that an
agent has a unique name for anything that can be referred
to. Also, knowing a standard name implies having made
an absolute identification. Therefore, to refer to a guest at
a costume party, it is a consequence of successful identifi-
cation that the speaker and the hearer mutually know the
identity of the person in the disguise, which is obviously
too strong a condition for successful reference. Developing
adequate criteria for PF identifiable terms is an important
research problem; however, none of the points in this paper
depend on what the criteria for PF identifiability are.
The importance of mutual belief to the successful use of
referring expressions was demonstrated by Clark and Mar-
shall (1981). It was shown by a series of rather complex
examples that, if one did not observe an infinite number
of preconditions of the form &amp;quot;A believes that B believes
that A believes that B believes ... description 0 applies
to R,&amp;quot; then it is impossible to guarantee that description
D can be used to refer felicitously to R, because it would
always be possible to construct some set of circumstances
in which the hearer would believe the speaker intended to
refer to something else. Perrault and Cohen (1081) show
that a slightly weaker condition is adequate: the mutual
belief preconditions have to hold in all hut a finite number
of cases. Nadathur and Joshi (1983) adopt a strategy that
amounts to assuming that if V is believed to apply to R.
then it is also mutually believed to apply to R unless there
is reason to believe that it is not.
The case for some form of mutual belief as a prerequisite
to a successful referring action is strong; however, speakers
often use noun phrases that should be analyzed as referen-
tial in which it is clear from the context that. not only is the
description not mutually believed to hold &gt;1the intended
referent, but the speaker knows this is the ease when lie
plans the utterance. For example, consider a situation in
which the speaker is giving instructions to the hearer and
says
(5) Turn left at the third block past the stoplight.
This utterance might be reasonable even if the hearer had
never been to the intersection in question and the speaker
and hearer have no mutual belief at the time of the utter-
ance about the location to which the speaker intends to

refer. The hearer knows that the speaker can formulate a
plan at the time of the utterance that will guarantee that
he will have identified the referent of the description at the
time that it is needed.
This observation is one motivation for the distinction
drawn along the horizontal axis of Figure 1. There are
really two kinds of definite referring actions: one is that in
which the precondition is mutual knowledge of a descrip-
tion, and the other in which there is mutual knowledge of
a plan incorporating the description to acquire additional
knowledge.

5 Definitions of Concept
Activation Actions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999810333333333">
This section discusses each of the four major types of con-
cept activation actions outlined in Section 3. The defi-
nitions of the actions are not stated rigorously, but are
intended to give the reader an intuitive understanding of
their preconditions and effects, and how they differ from
each other.

5.1 Shared Concept Activation with
Identification Intention (SI)
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.903326487804878">
These actions are the only type of concept activation ac-
tions that were considered in the earlier KAMP research.
SI actions are used most frequently in referring to past
events and objects that are not perceptually accessible to
the hearer. In such situations, the hearer can perform few,
if any, actions to acquire more knowledge that would enable
him to identify the referent of a description whose referent
was not already mutually known at the time of the utter-
ance.
SI Action: The speaker S performs action SI with hearer
H and term
Preconditions: There is some term D&apos; which is PF identi-
fiable; S and H mutually believe that Denotation(D) =
Denutation(D&apos;).
Effect: H knows that S intends that the term 0&apos; be active.
The preconditions of this action depend strictly on the
mutual belief of the speaker and the hearer at the time of
the utterance. The noun phrase in a sentence such as
(6) Use the same wrench you used to unfasten the pump.
roust arise from this type of action in normal situations of
its use, because the description, based on a past event, does
not facilitate any kind of plan for acquiring more informa-
tion.
When planning an utterance, the speaker knows the PF
identifiable term, and his problem is to get the hearer to
recognize the same term. Consistency with the Gricean
maxim of quantity requires that the planned description be
as simple or efficient as possible. There are several ways
to measure the complexity of a description, including the
number of descriptors involved and the ease with which
these descriptors can be incorporated into the utterance.
When planning an SI action, the planner&apos;s most important
task is reasoning about the efficiency of the description.
Concept activation actions that involve shared belief
about the denotation of the description at the time of the
utterance have the property that they are candidates for
action subsumption. Because the information required to
perform the identification can be communicated through a
subset of the descriptors in the noun phrase. or extralin-
guistically through pointing actions or strong contextual
cues, and because the precondition

is known to hold, the speaker can use the additional de-
scriptors to inform the hearer that the descriptors are true
of the intended referent.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.7398505">
5.2 Nonshared Concept Activation with
Identification Intention (NSI)
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9859614">
This action is what a speaker does when he wants to refer to
an object that is not known to the hearer, or for which the
speaker and hearer do not mutually believe enough proper-
ties at the time of the utterance so that identification can
take place based on mutual knowledge.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.582559">
NSI Action: The speaker S performs action NSI with
hearer H and term D.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.793820666666667">
Preconditions: S and H mutually believe that there is
some plan P such that, if!! executes P. then in the re-
sulting state, there exists a PF identifiable term D&apos; such
that H knows that Denotation(D) = Denotation(D1).
and S intends that H execute P.
Effects: H knows that S intends that D be active.
The NSI action is used in situations in which the speaker
and hearer do not mutuaily know the denotation of the de-
scription, yet, to realize the perlocutionary elti.cts of the
utterance, the hearer must be able to identify the speaker&apos;s
intencied referent. This lack of mutual knowledge may oc-
cur if the speaker can identify the referent from the de-
scription, but the hearer cannot, as is most likely the case
in example (5). Also, as is the case in example (7), the
speaker may not be able to identify the referent, but nev-
ertheless knows of a plan the hearer can execute that will
lead to. the identification of the referent at the appropriate
time.

<page confidence="0.995942">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.993343049180328">
The speaker of sentence (7) is uttering an attributive de-
scription, because he is probably not referring to a partic-
ular tomato, but to whatever tomato fits his description.
However, it is conceivable that he had a particular tomato
in mind, and chose that description because he believed it
would lead to the best plan for the hearer to identify it,
and would, in that case, be referential. One can see from
this example that the referential-attributive distinction is
orthogonal to the distinctions motivated by utterance plan-
ning. In both referential and attributive cases, the speaker
knows that the right conditions on mutual knowledge are
not satisfied for an SI action, and plans a description that
he knows the hearer can use successfully. It does not mat-
ter to the planner whether the description is referential or
attributive — the same reasoning takes place in both cases
with the same results.
The NSI action depends on the hearer&apos;s ability to find the
plan P. Therefore, the speaker must plan to furnish infor-
mation as part of D that will make it as easy as possible for
the hearer to formulate his plan. If the hearer has enough
infomation to formulate P, then P is a useful description.
It is possible for a speaker to formulate a description that,
although it denotes the individual the speaker has in mind,
is not useful because there is no plan the hearer can formu-
late to take advantage of the description. An example of
such a nonuseful description would be if S and H are riding
a bus, H asks at what stop he should get off, to which S
replies &amp;quot;one stop before I do.&amp;quot; The description &amp;quot;one stop
before I do,&apos; while being true of a unique location, is not
a useful description, assuming that the hearer has recourse
only to observing the speaker&apos;s actions.
The reader may wonder if an SI action can be regarded as
a degenerate case of the NSI action. In the case of the NSI
action, the speaker and hearer mutually know of a plan that
will result in identification of the intended referent, and in
the case of the SI action, the plan is simply to do nothing,
because the referent of the term is already mutually known.
This is not the case, because the precondition of the SI
action is that the speaker and hearer mutually believe both
the description in the noun phrase and the PF identifiable
description. In the case of the NSI action, the speaker and
he-.1rer mutually believe that executing plan P will result
in the hearer acquiring the required information, but, since
only the hearer is actually executing the plan, the speaker
and hearer may never meet the mutual belief condition of
the SI action. Therefore it is possible to have an NSI action
with a null plan, which is not equivalent to an SI action
with the same description. For example, suppose a speaker
wants a son to deliver an envelope to his father, and makes
the request
(8) Give this to your father.
although the speaker does not know who the son&apos;s father
is. In sentence (8) the speaker is using the description at-
tributively because he has no particular individual in mind,
just whoever fits the description. Furthermore, the speaker
assumes that the son is capable of identifying his own fa-
ther on the basis of knowledge he already has; therefore the
plan for the hearer to identify the description is to do noth-
ing. This is different from the SI action, in which there is
some individual who is mutually believed to be the hearer&apos;s
father.

5.3 Shared Concept Activation with No
Identification Intention (SNI)
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.991909212121212">
When a speaker performs an SNI action, he provides a de-
scription, but he does not intend that the hearer try to
identify its denotation. Therefore, the SNI action is not a
referring action, because identification is an essential part
of referring. The SNI action is used when a speaker has a
belief involving some individual for whom he has a descrip-
tion, but not a PF identifiable description, and intends that
the hearer hold the same belief.
SNI Action: The speaker S performs action SNI with
hearer H and term P.
Preconditions: S and H mutually believe that there ex-
ists an individual R such that Denotation(D) = R.
Effects: H knows that S intends that D be active.
The primary effect of the SNI action is the same as the
NSI action: it activates the term corresponding to the de-
scription D. However, because the preconditions are dif-
ferent, no intention to identify the description is communi-
cated, and the ultimate effect of the action on the hearer&apos;s
beliefs and intentions is therefore quite different. This type
of action underlies the use of an attributive description
when no identification is intended. This type of action has
been discussed in the literature (Donellan, 1066: Kripke.
1977) with the situation of two people discovering Smith&apos;s
badly mutilated body, and one saying The man who mur-
dered Smith is insane.&amp;quot; In this situation, the speaker is
informing the hearer of something about the referent of the
description &amp;quot;man who murdered Smith.&amp;quot; but does not know
who this individual is, nor does he intend that the hearer
identify him. However, there are conditions on the mutual
belief of the speaker and hearer for the utterance to make
sense. The speaker and hearer must mutually beiieve that
the dead man is Smith, that he was in fact murdered, and
that it was a man who killed him.

Unlike the SNI action, the NSNI action does not require
that the speaker and hearer share any knowledge about the
denotation of the description prior to the utterance. This
action is used by a speaker to introduce a new individual to
the discourse, without intending that the hearer associate
that individual with any that he already knows about. For
example, a speaker says, &amp;quot;I met an old friend from high
school yesterday.&amp;quot; The speaker does not assume that the
hearer shares any knowledge of his old high school friends,
nor does he intend the hearer to identify the person he is
talking about. The most important consideration for the
planner in this case is to include enough information in the
description 0 to serve the speaker&apos;s purpose in the rest of
the discourse.
NSNI actions are most frequently realized by referential
indefinite noun phrases (Fodor and Sag, 1982). Such a noun
phrase is indefinite, but it is clear from the context that
there is some particular individual that is denoted by the
description.

6 Summary

<bodyText confidence="0.999939566666667">
This paper has examined a class of actions called concept
activation actions, in which a speaker communicates the in-
tent that the hearer recognize a particular description. The
performance of one of these actions consists of uttering a
noun phrase, either in isolation, or as part of a sentence.
Therefore, the noun phrases resulting from the performance
of a concept activation action are, in some sense, referen-
tial, even though neither the speaker nor the hearer may
know the noun phrase&apos;s denotation, either at the time of
the utterance or subsequently.
While the four actions discussed in this paper account
for a very important class of noun phrases, the class by
no means exhausts all possibilities, and further research
is needed to understand the pragmatic considerations rel-
evant to other noun phrases. Some other noun-phrase ex-
amples of were discussed earlier, including quantificational
noun phrases and predicate nominals. Generics, and bare
plurals will require additional analysis. There is also an ex-
tremely important class of concept activation actions that
has not been discussed here, namely coreferring actions,
which ■‘nt ail the activation of terms that have already been
ritr,,riliced to the discourse.
This analysis of the actions underlying the production
of noun phrases is of particular importance to utterance
planning. Planning requires a characterization of actions
that describes what their effects are, when they are appli-
cable. and what strategies are available for their expansion.
The four actions described in this paper fill an important
gap that has been left open in previous utterance-planning
research.

When a speaker communicates with a hearer, he often intends the hearer to hold some attitudes toward individuals in the domain. This is particularly true in task-oriented dialogues where the hearer may have to locate and manipulate things in his environment. The theory of utterance planning assumed for the purpose of this analysis is the one embodied in KAMP (Appelt, 1985). Individuals are represented by terms in an intensional logic of knowledge and action. A metalanguage is used to axiomatize the relationship that holds between the terms and the individuals they denote. The terms can consist of predicates co:nbined with an iota operator, as in ix D(x), where D(x) Di(x) A . . . A D„(x). The predicates Di are called descriptors. and their conjunction. 0, is called a description. Because most noun phrases employ terms that are constructed from a description, often the words &amp;quot;term&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;description&amp;quot; are used interchangeably.

This program is very much in the spirit of the analysis of illocutionary acts provided by Cohen and Levesque (1980), who demonstrate how illocutionary acts can be defined in terms of the kinds of inferences made, given a semantic analysis of an utterance, facts about mutual knowledge, and general principles of rational behavior. Cohen (1984) provided such an analysis for referring actions by postulating a semantics for the definite determiner that would give the semantics of a definite noun phrase as a request to identify the referent of a description. This analysis would be impossible to extend to the more general concept activation actions, because, in some cases, the speaker intends that the hearer not identify the denotation of the description, even when a definite noun phrase is used.
