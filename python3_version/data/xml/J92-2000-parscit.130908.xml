Inheritance mechanisms and their implications for description, theory, and processing
have become an increasingly important research topic in computational linguistics. In
two special issues of Computational Linguistics, a sample of current research in this area
will be presented.
Volume 18, Number 2
In &amp;quot;Inheritance in Natural Language Processing,&amp;quot; Daelemans, De Smedt, and Gazdar
outline some of the motivations that have led to the widespread use of inheritance
mechanisms in computational linguistics and provide a survey of the recent literature.
Bouma, in &amp;quot;Feature Structures and Nonmonotonicity,&amp;quot; introduces default unifica-
tion as a means of reconciling inheritance with unification grammars. A formalism
based on monotonic multiple inheritance in networks of typed feature structures is
proposed in Zajac&apos;s paper &amp;quot;Inheritance and Constraint-Based Grammar Formalisms.&amp;quot;
Some linguistic frameworks have explicitly incorporated inheritance into their the-
ories. One of these is described &amp;quot;Inheritance in Word Grammar&amp;quot; by Fraser and Hudson.
While most work has used inheritance networks as a means to store static infor-
mation, a number of researchers have also begun to explore their utility in language
processing. An example of this is provided by van der Linden in &amp;quot;Incremental Pro-
cessing and the Hierarchical Lexicon.&amp;quot;

Volume 18, Number 3
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.592232230769231">
The main area of application of inheritance networks has been the structure and or-
ganization of computational lexicons. In the second of the two special issues, three
alternative approaches to inheritance in lexical representation are presented.
Andry, Fraser, McGlashan, Thornton, and Youd employ a DATR lexicon in the
context of a Unification Categorical Grammar in &amp;quot;Making DATR Work for Speech:
Lexicon Compilation in SUNDIAL.&amp;quot;
In &amp;quot;Inheritance and Complementation: A Case Study of Easy Adjectives and Re-
lated Nouns,&amp;quot; Flickinger and Nerbonne apply a default inheritance framework to the
lexical representation of complementation phenomena.
Finally, Russell, Ballim, Carroll, and Warwick-Armstrong introduce a language
for defining multiple default inheritance networks for the lexicon, inspired by object-
oriented programming, in &amp;quot;A Practical Approach to Multiple Default Inheritance for
Unification-Based Lexicons.&amp;quot;
