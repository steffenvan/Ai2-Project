1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999714454545455">
We are presenting the most recent version of MEAD (v.
3.08), a large-scale public-domain summarizer that has
been used in a number of applications, including the 2001
JHU summer workshop and the NewsInEssence project
(www.newsinessence.com). A version of MEAD
finished in first place on task 4 at DUC 2003 and finished
in the top three on two other tasks.
In this demo, we will be showing several interfaces
to MEAD, including a WAP-based cell phone interface,
a Web-based interface, a command-line interface, and a
Nutch-based interface.

1.1 Text summarization
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999991157894737">
Text summarization is the process of identifying salient
concepts in text, conceptualizing the relationships that
exist among them and generating concise representations
of the input text that preserve the gist of its content.
One distinguishes between single-document sum-
marization (SDS) and multi-document summarization
(MDS). MDS, which our approach will be focusing on,
is much more complicated than SDS in nature. Besides
the obvious difference in input size, several other factors
account for the complication, e.g.:
Multiple articles might come from different sources,
written by different authors, and therefore have dif-
ferent styles, although they are topically related.
This means that a summarizer cannot make the same
coherence assumption that it can for a single article.
Multiple articles might come out of different time
frames. Therefore an intelligent summarizer has to
take care of the temporal information and try to max-
imize the overall temporal cohesiveness of the sum-
mary.
Descriptions of the same event may differ in per-
spective, or even conflict with one another. The
summarizer should provide a mechanism to deal
with issues of this kind.
We also make the distinction between information-
extraction- vs. sentence-extraction-based summarizers.
The former, such as (Radev and McKeown, 1998), rely on
an information extraction system to extract very specific
aspects of some events and generate abstracts thereof.
This approach can produce good summaries but is usu-
ally knowledge intensive and domain dependent. Sen-
tence extraction techniques (Luhn, 1958; Radev et al.,
2000), on the other hand, compute a score for each sen-
tence based on certain features and output the most highly
ranked sentences. This approach is conceptually straight-
forward and usually domain independent, but the sum-
maries produced by it often need further revision to be
more smooth and coherent.

1.2 Centroid-based summarization and MEAD
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99672295">
Centroid-based summarization is a method of multi-
document summarization. It operates on a cluster of doc-
uments with a common subject (the cluster may be pro-
duced by a Topic Detection and Tracking, or TDT, sys-
tem). A cluster centroid, a collection of the most impor-
tant words from the whole cluster, is built. The centroid is
then used to determine which sentences from individual
documents are most representative of the entire cluster.
MEAD is a publicly available toolkit for multi-
document summarization (Radev et al., 2000; MEAD,
2003). The toolkit implements multiple summariza-
tion algorithms (at arbitrary compression rates) such as
position-based, TF*IDF, largest common subsequence,
and keywords. The methods for evaluating the quality of
the summaries are both intrinsic (such as percent agree-
ment, precision/recall, and relative utility) and extrinsic
(document rank).
MEAD has an expansive architecture which allows
end users to interface with its summarization capabilities
through a Perl and Java API.

2 Demonstration of MEAD
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997172">
The Mead Demo is a web-based demonstration of
MEAD. Users are able to add multiple documents for the
MEAD toolkit to summarize and display (see Figures 1–
4).
The Demo allows users to add documents by: selecting
files from their computer, adding text in the text box or
by supplying a URL to a specified web document. Doc-
uments can be plain text, HTML files or Microsoft Word
files.
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.963991">
Figure 3: The summary page displays the summary as
well as provides links to each document the user has sub-
mitted.
Figure 1: The user inputs a combination of files from
their hard drive, text into the text box and document
URLs.
Figure 2: After user has added all of the documents to be
summarized, they select the compression rate and then
submit for summarization.

WapMead (Figure 5) is a WAP (Wireless Access Pro-
tocol) interface to MEAD to access IMAP-based email

mailboxes from a cell phone or other WAP-enabled de-
vice. WapMead has two modes: a mailbox view, in which
a user can search for an email message and a summary
view, in which a summary of a message is displayed.
Summaries are displayed hierarchically, first showing the
most salient sentences in the entire message and then (on
a need basis) showing in greater detail particular areas of
the message.
