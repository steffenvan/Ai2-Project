<bodyText confidence="0.999702692307692">
Most work in statistical parsing has focused on a
single corpus: the Wall Street Journal portion of the
Penn Treebank. While this has allowed for quanti-
tative comparison of parsing techniques, it has left
open the question of how other types of text might
affect parser performance, and how portable pars-
ing models are across corpora. We examine these
questions by comparing results for the Brown and
WSJ corpora, and also consider which parts of the
parser&apos;s probability model are particularly tuned to
the corpus on which it was trained. This leads us
to a technique for pruning parameters to reduce the
size of the parsing model.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997353055555556">
The past several years have seen great progress in
the field of natural language parsing, through the use
of statistical methods trained using large corpora of
hand-parsed training data. The techniques of Char-
niak (1997), Collins (1997), and Ratnaparkhi (1997)
achieved roughly comparable results using the same
sets of training and test data. In each case, the cor-
pus used was the Penn Treebank&apos;s hand-annotated
parses of Wall Street Journal articles. Relatively
few quantitative parsing results have been reported
on other corpora (though see Stolcke et al. (1996)
for results on Switchboard, as well as Collins et
al. (1999) for results on Czech and Hwa (1999) for
bootstrapping from WSJ to ATIS). The inclusion of
parses for the Brown corpus in the Penn Treebank
allows us to compare parser performance across cor-
pora. In this paper we examine the following ques-
tions:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.981839222222222">
• To what extent is the performance of statistical
parsers on the WSJ task due to its relatively
uniform style, and how might such parsers fare
on the more varied Brown corpus?
• Can training data from one corpus be applied
to parsing another?
• What aspects of the parser&apos;s probability model
are particularly tuned to one corpus, and which
are more general?
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999865142857143">
Our investigation of these questions leads us to
a surprising result about parsing the WSJ corpus:
over a third of the model&apos;s parameters can be elim-
inated with little impact on performance. Aside
from cross-corpus considerations, this is an impor-
tant finding if a lightweight parser is desired or mem-
ory usage is a consideration.

2 Previous Comparisons of Corpora
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999930666666667">
A great deal of work has been done outside of the
parsing community analyzing the variations between
corpora and different genres of text. Biber (1993)
investigated variation in a number syntactic fea-
tures over genres, or registers, of language. Of
particular importance to statistical parsers is the
investigation of frequencies for verb subcategoriza-
tions such as Roland and Jurafsky (1998). Roland
et al. (2000) find that subcategorization frequen-
cies for certain verbs vary significantly between the
Wall Street Journal corpus and the mixed-genre
Brown corpus, but that they vary less so between
genre-balanced British and American corpora. Ar-
gument structure is essentially the task that auto-
matic parsers attempt to solve, and the frequencies
of various structures in training data are reflected in
a statistical parser&apos;s probability model. The varia-
tion in verb argument structure found by previous
research caused us to wonder to what extent a model
trained on one corpus would be useful in parsing an-
other. The probability models of modern parsers
include not only the number and syntactic type of
a word&apos;s arguments, but lexical information about
their fillers. Although we are not aware of previous
comparisons of the frequencies of argument fillers,
we can only assume that they vary at least as much
as the syntactic subcategorization frames.

3 The Parsing Model
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999971461538461">
We take as our baseline parser the statistical model
of Model 1 of Collins (1997). The model is a history-
based, generative model, in which the probability for
a parse tree is found by expanding each node in the
tree in turn into its child nodes, and multiplying the
probabilities for each action in the derivation. It can
be thought of as a variety of lexicalized probabilis-
tic context-free grammar, with the rule probabilities
factored into three distributions. The first distribu-
tion gives probability of the syntactic category H
of the head child of a parent node with category
P, head word Hhw with the head tag (the part of
speech tag of the head word) Hht:
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.772466">
Ph(HIP, Hht, Hhw)
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999886">
The head word and head tag of the new node H are
defined to be the same as those of its parent. The
remaining two distributions generate the non-head
children one after the other. A special #STOP#
symbol is generated to terminate the sequence of
children for a given parent. Each child is gener-
ated in two steps: first its syntactic category C and
head tag Cht are chosen given the parent&apos;s and head
child&apos;s features and a function A representing the
distance from the head child:
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.388412">
Pc(C, ChtjP, H, Hht, Hhw, A)
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.904255">
Then the new child&apos;s head word Chw is chosen:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.688469">
Pcw(ChwjP, H, Hht, Hhw, A, C, Cht)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999733214285714">
For each of the three distributions, the empirical dis-
tribution of the training data is interpolated with
less specific backoff distributions, as we will see in
Section 5. Further details of the model, including
the distance features used and special handling of
punctuation, conjunctions, and base noun phrases,
are described in Collins (1999).
The fundamental features of used in the proba-
bility distributions are the lexical heads and head
tags of each constituent, the co-occurrences of par-
ent nodes and their head children, and the co-
occurrences of child nodes with their head siblings
and parents. The probability models of Charniak
(1997), Magerman (1995) and Ratnaparkhi (1997)
differ in their details but are based on similar fea-
tures. Models 2 and 3 of Collins (1997) add some
slightly more elaborate features to the probability
model, as do the additions of Charniak (2000) to
the model of Charniak (1997).
Our implementation of Collins&apos; Model 1 performs
at 86% precision and recall of labeled parse con-
stituents on the standard Wall Street Journal train-
ing and test sets. While this does not reflect
the state-of-the-art performance on the WSJ task
achieved by the more the complex models of Char-
niak (2000) and Collins (2000), we regard it as a
reasonable baseline for the investigation of corpus
effects on statistical parsing.

4 Parsing Results on the Brown
Corpus
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9297603125">
We conducted separate experiments using WSJ
data, Brown data, and a combination of the two
as training material. For the WSJ data, we ob-
served the standard division into training (sections
2 through 21 of the treebank) and test (section 23)
sets. For the Brown data, we reserved every tenth
sentence in the corpus as test data, using the other
nine for training. This may underestimate the dif-
ficulty of the Brown corpus by including sentences
from the same documents in training and test sets.
However, because of the variation within the Brown
corpus, we felt that a single contiguous test section
might not be representative. Only the subset of the
Brown corpus available in the Treebank II bracket-
ing format was used. This subset consists primarily
of various fiction genres. Corpus sizes are shown in

Results for the Brown corpus, along with WSJ
results for comparison, are shown in Table 2. The
basic mismatch between the two corpora is shown
in the significantly lower performance of the WSJ-
trained model on Brown data than on WSJ data
(rows 1 and 2). A model trained on Brown data only
does significantly better, despite the smaller size of
the training set. Combining the WSJ and Brown
training data in one model improves performance
further, but by less than 0.5% absolute. Similarly,
adding the Brown data to the WSJ model increased
performance on WSJ by less than 0.5%. Thus, even
a large amount of additional data seems to have rel-
atively little impact if it is not matched to the test
material.
The more varied nature of the Brown corpus also
seems to impact results, as all the results on Brown
are lower than the WSJ result.

5 The Effect of Lexical
Dependencies
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999945444444444">
The parsers cited above all use some variety of lexical
dependency feature to capture statistics on the co-
occurrence of pairs of words being found in parent-
child relations within the parse tree. These word
pair relations, also called lexical bigrams (Collins,
1996), are reminiscent of dependency grammars such
as Melcuk (1988) and the link grammar of Sleator
and Temperley (1993). In Collins&apos; Model 1, the word
pair statistics occur in the distribution
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.3762">
Pcw(ChwlP, H, Hht, Hhw, 0, C, Cht)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999821076923077">
where Hhw represent the head word of a parent node
in the tree and Chw the head word of its (non-head)
child. (The head word of a parent is the same as the
head word of its head child.) Because this is the only
part of the model that involves pairs of words, it is
also where the bulk of the parameters are found. The
large number of possible pairs of words in the vocab-
ulary make the training data necessarily sparse. In
order to avoid assigning zero probability to unseen
events, it is necessary to smooth the training data.
The Collins model uses linear interpolation to es-
timate probabilities from empirical distributions of
varying specificities:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.99617075">
Pcw(ChwlP, H, Hht, Hhw, 0, C, Cht) =
A1 P�(ChwlP, H, Hht, Hhw, 0, C, Cht) +
(1 — A1)(A2 P�(ChwlP, H, Hht, 0, C, Cht)+
(1 — A2) P�(ChwlCht)) (1)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999979444444444">
where P� represents the empirical distribution de-
rived directly from the counts in the training data.
The interpolation weights A1, A2 are chosen as a
function of the number of examples seen for the con-
ditioning events and the number of unique values
seen for the predicted variable. Only the first distri-
bution in this interpolation scheme involves pairs of
words, and the third component is simply the prob-
ability of a word given its part of speech.
Because the word pair feature is the most spe-
cific in the model, it is likely to be the most corpus-
specific. The vocabularies used in corpora vary, as
do the word frequencies. It is reasonable to ex-
pect word co-occurrences to vary as well. In or-
der to test this hypothesis, we removed the distribu-
tion �P(ChwlP, H, Hht, Hhw, C, Cht) from the pars-
ing model entirely, relying on the interpolation of the
two less specific distributions in the parser:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.997965333333333">
Pcw2(ChwlP, H, Hht, 0, C, Cht) =
A2 P�(ChwlP, H, Hht, 0, C, Cht) +
(1 — A2) P�(ChwlCht) (2)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999985384615384">
We performed cross-corpus experiments as before
to determine whether the simpler parsing model
might be more robust to corpus effects. Results are
shown in Table 3.
Perhaps the most striking result is just how little
the elimination of lexical bigrams affects the baseline
system: performance on the WSJ corpus decreases
by less than 0.5% absolute. Moreover, the perfor-
mance of a WSJ-trained system without lexical bi-
grams on Brown test data is identical to the WSJ-
trained system with lexical bigrams. Lexical co-
occurrence statistics seem to be of no benefit when
attempting to generalize to a new corpus.

6 Pruning Parser Parameters
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998365">
The relatively high performance of a parsing model
with no lexical bigram statistics on the WSJ task
led us to explore whether it might be possible to
significantly reduce the size of the parsing model
by selectively removing parameters without sacri-
ficing performance. Such a technique reduces the
parser&apos;s memory requirements as well as the over-
head of loading and storing the model, which could
be desirable for an application where limited com-
puting resources are available.
Significant effort has gone into developing tech-
niques for pruning statistical language models for
speech recognition, and we borrow from this work,
using the weighted difference technique of Seymore
and Rosenfeld (1996). This technique applies to any
statistical model which estimates probabilities by
backing off, that is, using probabilities from a less
specific distribution when no data are available are
available for the full distribution, as the following
equations show for the general case:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.8129235">
P(elh) = P1(elh) if e E6 BO(h)
= a(h)P2(elh&apos;) if e E BO(h)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999557047619048">
Here e is the event to be predicted, h is the set of
conditioning events or history, a is a backoff weight,
and h&apos; is the subset of conditioning events used for
the less specific backoff distribution. BO is the back-
off set of events for which no data are present in the
specific distribution P1. In the case of n-gram lan-
guage modeling, e is the next word to be predicted,
and the conditioning events are the n — 1 preceding
words. In our case the specific distribution P1 of the
backoff model is Pcw of equation 1, itself a linear in-
terpolation of three empirical distributions from the
training data. The less specific distribution P2 of the
backoff model is Pcw2 of equation 2, an interpolation
of two empirical distributions. The backoff weight a
is simply 1 — A1 in our linear interpolation model.
The Seymore/Rosenfeld pruning technique can be
used to prune backoff probability models regardless
of whether the backoff weights are derived from lin-
ear interpolation weights or discounting techniques
such as Good-Turing. In order to ensure that the
model&apos;s probabilities still sum to one, the backoff

weight a must be adjusted whenever a parameter is
removed from the model. In the Seymore/Rosenfeld
approach, parameters are pruned according to the
following criterion:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.539084">
N(e, h)(log p(eIh) - log p&apos;(eIh&apos;)) (3)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999322738095238">
where p&apos;(elh&apos;) represents the new backed off proba-
bility estimate after removing p(eIh) from the model
and adjusting the backoff weight, and N(e, h) is the
count in the training data. This criterion aims to
prune probabilities that are similar to their back-
off estimates, and that are not frequently used. As
shown by Stolcke (1998), this criterion is an approx-
imation of the relative entropy between the original
and pruned distributions, but does not take into ac-
count the effect of changing the backoff weight on
other events&apos; probabilities.
Adjusting the threshold 0 below which parameters
are pruned allows us to successively remove more
and more parameters. Results for different values of
0 are shown in Table 4.
The complete parsing model derived from the
WSJ training set has 735,850 parameters in a to-
tal of nine distributions: three levels of backoff for
each of the three distributions Ph, P, and P,,,,. The
lexical bigrams are contained in the most specific
distribution for P,,,,. Removing all these parameters
reduces the total model size by 43%. The results
show a gradual degradation as more parameters are
pruned.
The ten lexical bigrams with the highest scores for
the pruning metric are shown in Table 5 for WSJ
and Table 6. The pruning metric of equation 3 has
been normalized by corpus size to allow compari-
son between WSJ and Brown. The only overlap
between the two sets is for pairs of unknown word
tokens. The WSJ bigrams are almost all specific
to finance, are all word pairs that are likely to ap-
pear immediately adjacent to one another, and are
all children of the base NP syntactic category. The
Brown bigrams, which have lower correlation val-
ues by our metric, include verb/subject and prepo-
sition/object relations and seem more broadly ap-
plicable as a model of English. However, the pairs
are not strongly related semantically, no doubt be-
cause the first term of the pruning criterion favors
the most frequent words, such as forms of the verbs
&amp;quot;be&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;have&amp;quot;.

Our results show strong corpus effects for statistical
parsing models: a small amount of matched train-

amount of unmatched data. The standard WSJ
task seems to be simplified by its homogenous style.
Adding training data from from an unmatched cor-
pus doesn&apos;t hurt, but doesn&apos;t help a great deal either.
In particular, lexical bigram statistics appear to

are of no use when attempting to generalize to new
training data. In fact, they are of surprisingly little
benefit even for matched training and test data -
removing them from the model entirely reduces per-
formance by less than 0.5% on the standard WSJ
parsing task. Our selective pruning technique al-
lows for a more fine grained tuning of parser model
size, and would be particularly applicable to cases
where large amounts of training data are available
but memory usage is a consideration. In our im-
plementation, pruning allowed models to run within
256MB that, unpruned, required larger machines.
The parsing models of Charniak (2000) and
Collins (2000) add more complex features to the
parsing model that we use as our baseline. An
area for future work is investigation of the degree
to which such features apply across corpora, or, on
the other hand, further tune the parser to the pe-
culiarities of the Wall Street Journal. Of particu-
lar interest are the automatic clusterings of lexical
co-occurrences used in Charniak (1997) and Mager-
man (1995). Cross-corpus experiments could reveal
whether these clusters uncover generally applicable
semantic categories for the parser&apos;s use.

<abstract confidence="0.9996">Most work in statistical parsing has focused on a single corpus: the Wall Street Journal portion of the Penn Treebank. While this has allowed for quantitative comparison of parsing techniques, it has left open the question of how other types of text might affect parser performance, and how portable parsing models are across corpora. We examine these questions by comparing results for the Brown and WSJ corpora, and also consider which parts of the parser&apos;s probability model are particularly tuned to the corpus on which it was trained. This leads us to a technique for pruning parameters to reduce the size of the parsing model.</abstract>

Our investigation of these questions leads us to a surprising result about parsing the WSJ corpus: over a third of the model&apos;s parameters can be eliminated with little impact on performance. Aside from cross-corpus considerations, this is an important finding if a lightweight parser is desired or memory usage is a consideration. 2 Previous Comparisons of Corpora A great deal of work has been done outside of the parsing community analyzing the variations between corpora and different genres of text. Biber (1993) investigated variation in a number syntactic features over genres, or registers, of language. Of particular importance to statistical parsers is the investigation of frequencies for verb subcategorizations such as Roland and Jurafsky (1998). Roland et al. (2000) find that subcategorization frequencies for certain verbs vary significantly between the Wall Street Journal corpus and the mixed-genre Brown corpus, but that they vary less so between genre-balanced British and American corpora. Argument structure is essentially the task that automatic parsers attempt to solve, and the frequencies of</context>

Our selective pruning technique allows for a more fine grained tuning of parser model size, and would be particularly applicable to cases where large amounts of training data are available but memory usage is a consideration. In our implementation, pruning allowed models to run within 256MB that, unpruned, required larger machines.

The more varied nature of the Brown corpus also seems to impact results, as all the results on Brown are lower than the WSJ result. 5 The Effect of Lexical Dependencies The parsers cited above all use some variety of lexical dependency feature to capture statistics on the cooccurrence of pairs of words being found in parentchild relations within the parse tree. These word pair relations, also called lexical bigrams (Collins, 1996), are reminiscent of dependency grammars such as Melcuk (1988) and the link grammar of Sleator and Temperley (1993). In Collins&apos; Model 1, the word pair statistics occur in the distribution Pcw(ChwlP, H, Hht, Hhw, 0, C, Cht) where Hhw represent the head word of a parent node in the tree and Chw the head word of its (non-head) child. (The head word of a parent is the same as the head word of its head child.)

The variation in verb argument structure found by previous research caused us to wonder to what extent a model trained on one corpus would be useful in parsing another. The probability models of modern parsers include not only the number and syntactic type of a word&apos;s arguments, but lexical information about their fillers. Although we are not aware of previous comparisons of the frequencies of argument fillers, we can only assume that they vary at least as much as the syntactic subcategorization frames. 3 The Parsing Model We take as our baseline parser the statistical model of Model 1 of Collins (1997). The model is a historybased, generative model, in which the probability for a parse tree is found by expanding each node in the tree in turn into its child nodes, and multiplying the probabilities for each action in the derivation. It can be thought of as a variety of lexicalized probabilistic context-free grammar, with the rule probabilities factored into three distributions. The first distribution gives probability of the syntactic category H of the head child of a parent node with category P, head word Hhw with the head tag (the part of speech tag of the head word) Hht: Ph(HIP, Hht, Hhw) </context>

Such a technique reduces the parser&apos;s memory requirements as well as the overhead of loading and storing the model, which could be desirable for an application where limited computing resources are available. Significant effort has gone into developing techniques for pruning statistical language models for speech recognition, and we borrow from this work, using the weighted difference technique of Seymore and Rosenfeld (1996). This technique applies to any statistical model which estimates probabilities by backing off, that is, using probabilities from a less specific distribution when no data are available are available for the full distribution, as the following equations show for the general case: P(elh) = P1(elh) if e E6 BO(h) = a(h)P2(elh&apos;) if e E BO(h) Here e is the event to be predicted, h is the set of conditioning events or history, a is a backoff weight, and h&apos; is the subset of conditioning events used for the less specific backoff distribution. BO is the backoff set of events for which no data are prese</context>

The more varied nature of the Brown corpus also seems to impact results, as all the results on Brown are lower than the WSJ result. 5 The Effect of Lexical Dependencies The parsers cited above all use some variety of lexical dependency feature to capture statistics on the cooccurrence of pairs of words being found in parentchild relations within the parse tree. These word pair relations, also called lexical bigrams (Collins, 1996), are reminiscent of dependency grammars such as Melcuk (1988) and the link grammar of Sleator and Temperley (1993). In Collins&apos; Model 1, the word pair statistics occur in the distribution Pcw(ChwlP, H, Hht, Hhw, 0, C, Cht) where Hhw represent the head word of a parent node in the tree and Chw the head word of its (non-head) child. (The head word of a parent is the same as the head word of its head child.) Because this is the only part of the model that involves pairs of words, it is also where the bulk of the parameters are found. The large number of possible pairs of words in the vocabulary make the training data necessarily sparse. In order to avoid assigning zero probability to unseen events, it is nec</context>

The techniques of Charniak (1997), Collins (1997), and Ratnaparkhi (1997) achieved roughly comparable results using the same sets of training and test data. In each case, the corpus used was the Penn Treebank&apos;s hand-annotated parses of Wall Street Journal articles. Relatively few quantitative parsing results have been reported on other corpora (though see Stolcke et al. (1996) for results on Switchboard, as well as Collins et al. (1999) for results on Czech and Hwa (1999) for bootstrapping from WSJ to ATIS). The inclusion of parses for the Brown corpus in the Penn Treebank allows us to compare parser performance across corpora. In this paper we examine the following questions: • To what extent is the performance of statistical parsers on the WSJ task due to its relatively uniform style, and how might such parsers fare on the more varied Brown corpus? • Can training data from one corpus be applied to parsing another? • What aspects of the parser&apos;s probability model </context>

In the Seymore/Rosenfeld approach, parameters are pruned according to the following criterion: N(e, h)(log p(eIh) - log p&apos;(eIh&apos;)) (3) where p&apos;(elh&apos;) represents the new backed off probability estimate after removing p(eIh) from the model and adjusting the backoff weight, and N(e, h) is the count in the training data. This criterion aims to prune probabilities that are similar to their backoff estimates, and that are not frequently used. As shown by Stolcke (1998), this criterion is an approximation of the relative entropy between the original and pruned distributions, but does not take into account the effect of changing the backoff weight on other events&apos; probabilities. Adjusting the threshold 0 below which parameters are pruned allows us to successively remove more and more parameters. Results for different values of 0 are shown in Table 4. The complete parsing model derived from the WSJ training set has 735,850 parameters in a total of nine distributions: three levels of backoff for each of the three distributions Ph, P, and P,,,,.
