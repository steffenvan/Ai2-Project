Prosodic phrase structure provides important information for the understanding and naturalness
of synthetic speech, and a good model of prosodic phrases has applications in both speech synthesis
and speech understanding. This work describes a statistical model of an embedded hierarchy of
prosodic phrase structure, motivated by results in linguistic theory. Each level of the hierarchy is
modeled as a sequence of subunits at the next level, with the lowest level of the hierarchy repre-
senting factors such as syntactic branching and prosodic constituent length using a binary tree
classification. A maximum likelihood solution for parameter estimation is presented, allowing
automatic training of different speaking styles. For predicting prosodic phrase breaks from text,
a dynamic programming algorithm is given for finding the maximum probability prosodic parse.
Experimental results on a corpus of radio news demonstrate a high rate of success for predict-
ing major and minor phrase boundaries from text without syntactic information (81% correct
prediction with 4% false prediction).

Prosodic phrase structure plays a role in both naturalness and intelligibility of speech.
For example, prosodic phrase boundaries break the flow of a sentence, dividing it into
smaller units for easier processing. In addition, researchers have shown that prosodic
phrase break placement is important in syntactic disambiguation (Lehiste 1973; Price,
Ostendorf, Shattuck-Hufnagel, and Fong 1991). For these reasons, computational mod-
eling of prosodic phrases is important both for text-to-speech synthesis and speech
understanding applications. In this work, we present a computational model that rep-
resents a hierarchy of prosodic constituents using a stochastic formalism to capture the
natural variability allowable in prosodic phrasing. The model is useful for both anal-
ysis and synthesis applications; we focus on synthesis here, and present experimental
results for predicting prosodic phrase structure from text.
Prosodic phrase structure, or groupings of words in a sentence, can be equiva-
lently represented by different phrase break markers. The location and relative size
of these breaks define the prosodic phrase structure, which we will refer to here as
a prosodic parse. Prosodic phrase breaks are discrete events that are associated with
acoustic cues such as duration lengthening, pause insertion, and intonation markers.
In this work, we are concerned only with the relationship between the abstract events

(different levels of phrase breaks) and text. To be useful in synthesis or understanding
applications, the results presented here need to be integrated with a component that
models the acoustics associated with these abstract events (see, for example, Hirose
and Fujisaki 1982).
Several observations about prosodic phrase breaks raise issues to be considered
in designing an algorithm to predict such breaks from text. First, there is a signifi-
cant body of literature in linguistics concerning various hierarchies that specify the
relationship among prosodic constituents, and the model should reflect this structure.
Second, several different prosodic parses may all be acceptable for one sentence. This
variability is particularly important to represent if the model is to be useful for anal-
ysis as well as synthesis. Third, prosodic phrase breaks do not always coincide with
syntactic phrase boundaries, and the relationship between prosody and syntax is not
well understood. This means that prosodic phrases cannot simply be predicted from
syntactic structure. Finally, since most text-to-speech synthesis applications require a
low cost implementation, there is the concern of computational complexity. We shall
expand on these points separately below, to motivate the work described here.
The various linguistic theories of prosodic phrase structure (e.g., Liberman and
Prince 1977; Selkirk 1980, 1984; Beckman and Pierrehumbert 1986; Nespor and Vogel
1983; Ladd 1986) differ in the specific levels that they represent, but all have a similar
hierarchical structure. Two levels of prosodic phrases are common to most propos-
als: the intonational phrase and the intermediate phrase, using the terminology of
Beckman and Pierrehumbert. A sentence is composed of a sequence of intonational
phrases, which in turn are composed of sequences of intermediate phrases. An in-
tonational phrase break is therefore perceived as stronger or more salient than an
intermediate phrase break. Intonational phrases are delimited by boundary tones, and
intermediate phrases are theoretically marked with a phrase accent, where the pitch
markers can be either high or low (Beckman and Pierrehumbert 1986). (In other the-
ories of intonation, for example, t&apos;Hart, Collier, and Cohen [1990], pitch markers also
occur at phrase boundaries, but are identified with movement and referred to as either
rising or falling.) Both types of constituents are also cued by segmental lengthening in
the phrase final syllable (Wightman, Shattuck-Hufnagel, Ostendorf, and Price 1992).
Since intonational and intermediate phrases are generally accepted, the experiments
here will only address these two levels, referring to them as major and minor phrases,
respectively. However, other types of prosodic constituents may be useful and, in fact,
there is durational evidence for at least four levels (Wightman, Shattuck-Hufnagel, Os-
tendorf, and Price 1991; Ladd and Campbell 1991). We therefore propose a more gen-
eral hierarchical model that can be extended to an arbitrary, but fixed, number of levels.
In the examples given here, we will represent intonational phrases (I) using &amp;quot;II&amp;quot; to
mark a major break and intermediate phrases (i) using &amp;quot;I&amp;quot; to mark a minor break. The
example below illustrates how phrase breaks are used to represent prosodic phrase
structure:
Those on early release I must check in with correction officials II
fifty times a week 11 according to Ash, hi
who says about half I the contacts for a select group
will now be made I by the computerized phone calls. I

<bodyText confidence="0.998872777777778">
Another important consideration in modeling prosody (and evaluating the model)
is that prosodic phrase structure is not deterministic. Speakers can produce a sentence
in several ways without altering the naturalness or the meaning. Prosodic breaks can
differ in size and/or placement because of differences in style, competence, or simply
natural speaking variations. For example, the following sentence was said three ways
by five speakers:
They&apos;re in jail for such things II as bad checks or stealing.
They&apos;re in jail for such things as bad checks or stealing.
They&apos;re in jail I for such things as bad checks or stealing.
Although deterministic rules can be used to predict phrase breaks for speech syn-
thesis applications, such a model will be limited in its usefulness in speech analysis.
In addition, speech synthesis might be more natural if variability is included in the
model. Here, a stochastic model is used to represent the natural variability in prosodic
structure by deriving probabilities of phrase breaks, rather than predicting locations
of phrase breaks by rule.
The relationship between prosody and syntax is not fully understood, though it
is generally accepted that there is such a relationship. For example, relatively higher
syntactic attachment usually corresponds to relatively larger prosodic breaks, but there
are many exceptions, as in:
(iMaryinp [was amazed [Ann Dewey was angrylnipis
which was produced by four speakers as
Mary was amazed H Ann Dewey was angry.
In an analysis of the London—Lund corpus, Altenberg (1987) finds relative frequencies
that describe the correspondence between prosodic constituents (tone units) and dif-
ferent syntactic units. This data supports the use of a probabilistic model, which also
has an advantage in that it can be trained automatically, facilitating representation of
a wide variety of speaking styles and allowing a means of discovering syntax-prosody
relationships from a large corpus. One reason that the mapping between syntax and
prosody is not simple is because, in speech, the constraints of syntactic structure and
phrase length are balanced to produce a regular, roughly equal, sequence of prosodic
phrases (Gee and Grosjean 1983). Consequently, we include constituent length as a
factor in the model.
The cost of obtaining a full and accurate syntactic parse can be high, which presents
difficulties for text-to-speech synthesis systems. In addition, a full syntactic parse may
not be necessary for predicting prosodic phrases, since prosody is not directly related to
syntax. Consequently, we investigate computation/performance trade-offs associated
with using a skeletal syntactic parse vs. simple part-of-speech (POS) assignments.
To summarize, the model proposed here addresses several issues in modeling
prosodic phrase structure. The model is a general formalism for an embedded hier-
archy, which we specifically apply to represent sentences, major phrases, and minor
phrases. In order to account for the allowable variability in prosodic parsing, the model
is probabilistic. The structure of the model allows use of grammatical information such
as part-of-speech labels, syntactic structure and constituent length, but the specific pa-
rameters are trained automatically. Finally, computational complexity trade-offs are
investigated by evaluating the algorithm with and without syntactic cues.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. We begin, in Section 2, by
discussing past work in predicting prosodic phrase breaks from text for speech syn-
thesis. In Section 3, we introduce the probabilistic formalism of the hierarchical model
and outline the implementation: text pre-processing, parameter estimation, and phrase
break prediction using a dynamic programming algorithm to obtain the most likely
prosodic parse. In Section 4, we present experimental results for prediction of major
and minor prosodic phrase breaks based on a corpus of FM radio news stories. Finally,
we conclude in Section 5 by discussing possible implications and extensions of these
results.

Initial attempts to incorporate prosody in speech synthesis involved determining into-
nation and duration patterns as a function of syntactic phrase structure (Allen, Hunni-
cutt, Carlson, and Granstrom 1979; Allen, Hunnicutt, and Klatt 1987), which requires
syntactic parsing. More recently, researchers have attempted to address the fact that
prosody and syntax are not directly related by explicitly predicting prosodic phrase
boundaries rather than using syntactic clause boundaries. An important difference be-
tween these subsequent approaches is in the amount of syntactic information used to
predict prosodic boundaries. The algorithms reflect different assumptions about the
relationship between prosody and syntax, as well as different levels of computational
complexity. Clearly, a greater use of syntactic information will require more computa-
tion for finding a more detailed syntactic parse.
One approach is based on the idea that a prosodic parse may not require a full
syntactic parse and that detailed part-of-speech information (e.g., noun, verb, deter-
miner) may not be necessary for generating a prosodic parse. Sorin, Larreur, and Llorca
(1987) proposed a simple prosodic parser for French based on content/function word
classification to determine prosodic constituents referred to as prosodic groups. The
length and relative location of these prosodic groups is then used to determine phrase
break locations that are marked with a pause. Our earlier work drew on this scheme
for predicting phrase boundaries in English: a Markov model was developed to pre-
dict phrase breaks by representing the sequence of prosodic groups and breaks as a
Markov chain (Veilleux, Ostendorf, Price, and Shattuck-Hufnagel 1990). An advantage
of these approaches is that they only require a small dictionary of function words to as-
sign part-of-speech labels. Motivated by similar principles and using only a 300-word
dictionary, O&apos;Shaughnessy (1989) proposes a somewhat more sophisticated parser for
English based on function word identification, number agreement, and suffix identi-
fication. O&apos;Shaughnessy&apos;s work differs from the other approaches in that his goal is a
syntactic parse, though not complete, and he does not address the issue of differences
between prosody and syntax.
At the other end of the spectrum are approaches based on the hypothesis that
prosodic phrase boundaries can be predicted by rule from a full syntactic parse. Gee
and Grosjean (1983) developed a rule-based system, called the Phi Algorithm, to pre-
dict psycholinguistic &amp;quot;performance structures&amp;quot; that are represented by assigning an
integer number corresponding to boundary salience between each pair of words. Con-
stituent length information is incorporated primarily through the application of their
verb balancing rule, which splits the verb phrase and groups the verb with either the
previous or subsequent material, subject to syntactic constraints. Gee and Grosjean
developed their Phi Algorithm only to predict performance structures. However, their
work has been extended to prosodic phrase prediction for speech synthesis applica-
tions by Bachenko and Fitzpatrick (1990), who explicitly find prosodic phrase breaks

from derived boundary salience indices. They relax many of the constraints on the
use of the verb rule and propose a Verb Adjacency Rule, so their algorithm requires
a fairly detailed parse, although not a complete one. One of the relaxed constraints
obviates the need for clause information. Altenberg (1987) has also proposed an algo-
rithm for prediction of phrase boundary locations (specifically, tone unit boundaries
for British English) by rule from syntactic structure and semantic information. How-
ever, the detailed information required for the algorithm cannot currently be acquired
automatically from text.
Departing from these approaches, Wang and Hirschberg (1992) have recently used
binary decision trees to predict the presence or absence of a prosodic break at each
word boundary in a sentence. They consider a range of input variables, including text-
derived information such as detailed POS labels and syntactic constituent structure,
and in some experiments, acoustic information. POS labels were given by Church&apos;s
tagger (Church 1988) and syntactic constituents by Hindle&apos;s parser (Hindle 1987). The
acoustic information (previous boundary location, pitch accent location, and phrase
duration), which was based on hand-labeled prosodic markers, did not improve per-
formance but resulted in a much smaller tree for prediction.
All of these approaches have influenced the model proposed here. For example, we
investigate simple content/function word POS assignment, as in Sorin, Larreur, and
Llorca (1987). Like Wang and Hirschberg (1992), we use decision trees to automatically
determine the important factors influencing phrase break location. In addition, all of
the above works have influenced the choice of factors and questions incorporated
in the decision tree. Two important differences in our approach include a stochastic
model to capture variability and an explicit representation of a linguistically motivated
hierarchy. Of course, whether it is effective and/or efficient for a computational model
to reflect a linguistic hierarchy is an empirical question.

A prosodic parse of a sentence can be represented by a sequence of break indices, one

values from no break&amp;quot; (orthographic word boundary, but not a prosodic constituent
boundary) to &amp;quot;sentence boundary,&amp;quot; where the values form an ordered set that corre-
spond to the different levels of the hierarchy. Below we consider a stochastic model
for first a general hierarchical prosodic parse (any specified number of levels), and
then specifically for the three-level case that models a sentence as a sequence of major
phrases, which are in turn modeled as a sequence of minor phrases. Although most
phonological theories do not recognize the &amp;quot;sentence&amp;quot; as a unit, it is useful for both
synthesis and recognition applications to model sentences separately, as sentence-final
boundaries tend to be acoustically different from sentence-internal boundaries (e.g., a
low boundary tone is much more likely).1

We assume the relationship between units and subunits will hold at any level of the
hierarchy. Therefore, in describing the general case, we need only consider one level of
embedding and will use U, and u,i when referring to units and subunits, respectively,
at some unspecified level of the hierarchy. Using this notation, the probability of a unit
111 is parameterized in terms of the probability of the sequence of subunits u,i (on the
next lower level) and the length ni in subunits of that sequence given the orthographic
transcription of the sentence W:

The specific hierarchy considered here involves representing the prosodic parse of
a sentence S as an N-length sequence of major phrases /A:

A major phrase Mi is composed of a n,-length sequence of minor phrases
Mi = , , • , min, )•
Finally, a minor phrase rn,1 is composed of a vg-length sequence of breaks bt starting

where t(i,j) is the time index of the first word of mu and t(i,j+ 1) —1 is the time index
of the final word of in, v = f(i,j + 1) — t(i,j) is simply the number of words in the
minor phrase, and the breaks b! take on values from the set {no break, minor break,
major break, sentence break}.
It might be useful to consider phonological words rather than orthographic words
as possible sites for break indices. This could be accomplished, without using de-
terministic rules, by specifying the bottom of the hierarchy (e.g., break level 0) to
represent locations internal to a phonological word and the next level of the hierar-
chy (e.g., break level I) to represent phonological word boundaries. However, it is
controversial as to whether phonological words can be larger or smaller than ortho-
graphic (lexical) words (Booij 1983; Nespor and Vogel 1983), so it is not clear how the
lowest level should be defined relative to the orthographic words. In this work, we
have chosen not to distinguish between these two levels, to reduce the complexity
of implementation and performance evaluation. For similar reasons, we have limited
comprises syntactically well-formed sentences. The phrase prediction model may also be useful in
speech recognition applications, in which case the term &amp;quot;utterance&amp;quot; would clearly be more appropriate.

this study to the more universally agreed-upon levels of major and minor prosodic
phrases, although there is durational evidence that a more detailed hierarchy would
be useful (Ladd and Campbell 1991; Wightman, Shattuck-Flufnagel, Ostendorf, and
Price 1992).
In the current work, we make several simplifying assumptions due to training
limitations. First, the probability of the number of subunits in a unit p(n,ILI,) is assumed
to depend only on the number of words in the unit i(U). As is not surprising, our data
indicate that units that span a larger number of words tend to comprise more subunits.
Altenberg has noticed similar tendencies in the London—Lund corpus (Altenberg 1987,
p. 81). (Alternatively, it has been suggested that either phonological word count or
stressed syllable count rather than orthographic word count may be a useful measure
of phrase length on the lowest level [Bachenko and Fitzpatrick 19901.) In addition,
the probability distribution is approximated by conditioning on quantized lengths
Qu(k(U,)). The quantizer varies as a function of the specific unit and is designed
using a regression tree (Breiman, Friedman, Olshen, and Stone 1984). A regression
tree partitions the data along intervals of a continuous variable, in this case length of
the unit, to decrease variance of the response variable, the number of subunits in the
unit. The resulting quantizer regions and the corresponding distribution of subunits
in a unit are given in Table 1 for major phrase and sentence units.
Using these simplifying assumptions, the constituent length probability distribu-
tions are then:

where L = Q5 (?(S)), I; = Qm(i(Mi)) and = (2/1/ )) •

The conditional probability of a sequence of words within a minor phrase is assumed
to depend on a state determined by the (variable-length) sequence of past words and
the time of the last break, where the state is given by a decision tree as in Bahl, Brown,

sequence of feature vectors, one per word extracted from the word sequence. Examples
of possible features include part-of-speech labels and syntactic information such as
bracketing labels or labels of an associated node in a syntactic tree. The decision tree
f (wi,mpre„) used in determining the probabilities p(bklf inpreu)) includes questions
based on these features, attributes of the previous minor phrase and the current major
phrase, and length in words of the sentence. Details on our specific choice of features
and questions is given in Section 4.
Our use of decision trees is different from the phrase break detection algorithm
of Wang and Hirschberg (1992), although the tree design algorithm and choice of
features is similar. The tree is not used to classify phrase breaks directly; instead it is
used to determine the probability of the occurrence of a minor break at some location,
conditioned on the decision tree structure. This probability is used to represent the
lowest level in the hierarchical model.
Previously, we mentioned two important factors affecting the placement of phrase
breaks: (1) grammatical structure and (2) length constraints on the prosodic con-
stituents such as overall length and length relative to neighboring phrases. Gram-
matical information is incorporated in the tree f(WhInp,) through questions about
the feature sequence Wi. Prosodic constituent length is modeled in two ways, through
the constituent length probability distributions and through questions about the length
of the previous phrase used in the tree f (1Vi, Mprev).

and, but, if, because), auxiliary verbs and modals (v), determiners (d), prepositions (p),
pronouns (n), and a general category (g), which includes the quantifiers and function-
like adverbs such as not, no, ever, now. The POS labels given by the simple table look-up
are referred to here as &amp;quot;word classes.&amp;quot; A more detailed part-of-speech classification is
given by Penn Treebank POS tags (Marcus and Santorini 1993), which were obtained
automatically using the BBN tagger (Meteer, Schwartz, and Weischedel 1991). What
we refer to here as POS labels is actually a grouping of these classes that includes
the above function word categories, the proper name category (now determined by
the tagger rather than from capitalization), plus categories for particles (pa), nouns
(noun), verbs (verb), adjectives (adj), adverbs (adv), and all other content words (def).
Contractions are not decomposed into separate words, since it is not possible that
a phrase break will occur within the word contraction. The contraction is treated as a
single word in constituent length measures and feature extraction, and it is assigned
the POS label of its base word (left component).
Punctuation following a word is incorporated as a feature for that word. In our
data, the only punctuation that appears are commas and periods. Periods and other
sentence-final punctuation deterministically assign a sentence break. This implies some
text preprocessing that distinguishes periods used for abbreviation from sentence-final
periods. While commas often correspond to major breaks, there is a systematic excep-
tion: a series of the same syntactic units such as a series of nouns (an apple, an orange,
and a pear) or a series of adjectives (safe, cost-effective alternative ...) may or may not be
associated with a major prosodic break. Therefore, we have chosen to use commas as a
feature to determine the likelihood of a phrase break rather than as a deterministic cue
to a prosodic break. Although using commas deterministically to assign a major phrase
boundary yields better performance on our test set than using commas as a feature,
we felt that using commas as a feature was a more extensible approach, and have used
this strategy in the results reported here. Including commas as a feature does improve
performance relative to not using commas, as will be discussed in Section 4. Commas
(and other punctuation) can be very useful for prosodic boundary prediction when
they are available, and they are used in other algorithms (e.g., Allen, Hunnicutt, and
Klatt 1987; O&apos;Shaughnessy 1989; I3achenko and Fitzpatrick 1990). However, commas
are not reliably transcribed from spoken language and not consistently used in written
text, so it is important that the algorithm not depend too heavily on commas.

Syntactic features were extracted from skeletal parses provided through a prelim-
inary version of the Penn Treebank Corpus. Since these are hand-corrected parses, the
results are indicative of the performance possible using syntactic information, but do
not reflect performance achievable with an existing parser. Several researchers have
investigated the relationship between prosody and syntax (e.g., Selkirk 1984; Gee and
Grosjean 1983; Cooper and Paccia-Cooper 1980; Altenberg 1987). Our features have
been motivated by some of these results, which suggest that some syntactic con-
stituents are more likely to be separated by a phrase break than others. However,
we have chosen to let the important constituents be determined automatically, similar
to Wang and Hirschberg (1992), rather than by rule. One feature is the highest syn-
tactic constituent dominating the left word but not dominating the right word, which
describes potential locations for phrase breaks after a specific syntactic constituent. We
also consider the similar case, the highest syntactic constituent dominating the right
word but not the left, to allow for prosodic phrase breaks that may be associated with
the beginning of a syntactic constituent. The lowest syntactic constituent that domi-
nates both words is a feature that will provide information about which constituents
are not likely to be divided by a phrase break. In addition, the number of terminat-
ing constituents and the number of initiating constituents between the two words
were included as features to investigate the influence of relative strength of syntac-
tic attachment. Eight categories of syntactic constituent were used: sentence (5), noun
phrase (NP), verb phrase (VP), prepositional phrase (PP), wh-noun phrase (VVIINP),
adjective or adverbial phrase (AP), any other constituent (0), and both words in the
same lowest level constituent (same).

An advantage of a stochastic model is that the parameters can be estimated automat-

likelihood approach to parameter estimation, where model parameters are chosen to
maximize the likelihood of the training data.
We will assume that sentences are independent and identically distributed to sim-
plify parameter estimation and prediction, although the independence assumption
precludes capturing any speaker-dependent or discourse effects. In this case, the like-

Since there are no cross dependencies between parameters, the four terms in Equa-
tion (7) can be maximized separately. The resulting parameter estimates for qs, qm, and
are then simply relative frequency estimates. The last term is maximized jointly with
the design of the state function f(.) using standard classification tree design techniques,
as described below.
The tree is grown using a greedy algorithm, which iteratively extends branches
by choosing the parameters of a question, the question at a node and the node in
a tree that together maximize some criterion for reducing the impurity of the class
distributions at the leaves of the tree. The tree is used to find the probability of a
minor phrase boundary, so there are only two classes: &amp;quot;break&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;no break.&amp;quot; In
this work, we have used the Gini criterion, i.e., the node distribution impurity is
given by i(t) = t)p(ilt) (Breirnan, Friedman, Olshen, and Stone 1984). Since
the relative frequency of the &amp;quot;break&amp;quot; class is so low (8% of all breaks), we include
different error costs in the design criterion. Generally, the cost of classifying a &amp;quot;break&amp;quot;
as &amp;quot;no break&amp;quot; is chosen to be three to four times higher than the opposite error,
and the specific costs for each tree are chosen to control the false prediction rate
on the training set. Initially a tree is grown using two-thirds of the training data,
and the remaining one-third of the data is used to determine a good complexity-
performance trade-off point. The complexity criterion determined at this point is then
used in pruning a second tree grown with the entire training set, in order to make
better use of the available data. Each leaf t of the tree is associated with a conditional
probability distribution of &amp;quot;break&amp;quot; vs. &amp;quot;no break&amp;quot; (actually, the relative frequency es-
timate). This probability distribution p(b t) is used in the hierarchical model for com-
puting the probability of a minor phrase, Equation (6), by running test data through

The stochastic model can be used to predict a prosodic parse for a sentence simply
by finding the most probable prosodic parse for that sequence of words, where the
probability of any given parse is determined by Equations (4)—(6). In other words,
we hypothesize all possible prosodic parses, compute the probability of each, and
choose the most probable. The most likely prosodic parse can be found efficiently
using a dynamic programming (DP) algorithm that is similar to algorithms used in
speech recognition, in particular that for the Stochastic Segment Model (Ostendorf
and Roukos 1989), except that the dynamic programming routine is called recursively
for successive levels in the hierarchy. Defining pr(un ...uthIVPI,U1) as the probability

the above equation is determined. Using the n* associated with any level unit, we can
trace back to find the optimal segmentation of subunits that comprise that unit. The
complete parse is found by tracing back at the highest level units and successively
tracing back in each lower level.

For our investigation of prosodic phrase structure, an FM radio news story corpus
was used. The training data included ten stories from one announcer and another ten
stories from a second announcer, both female, for a total of 312 sentences (6,157 words,
or potential boundary locations). The stories were studio recordings of actual radio
broadcasts, which were transcribed by a listener who did not have access to the original
scripts. It is likely that transcription of punctuation did not exactly match the original
written text and may have been biased by the prosody of the utterance. However,
the radio announcers tended to annotate the transcribed text before reading the test
stories, so we conjecture that commas were more often omitted than inserted in our
transcriptions. All of the training stories were used to estimate the probabilities of the

number of subconstituents (Equations 1-3). In the first pass of tree design, two-thirds
of the training data was used to grow the tree and one-third was used to determine
the performance complexity trade-off, but the final tree used was redesigned on the
entire training set.
For testing, we used five versions of a different story spoken by two female and
two male announcers (one radio broadcast version and four radio-news-style lab
recordings). One of the female announcers (two spoken versions) was the same as
the speaker who provided roughly three-quarters of the training data. Multiple test
versions are used in order to allow for some acceptable differences in phrasing in
the context of the FM radio news style, and to investigate the possibility of speaker-
dependent effects. On average, there were 3.3 different prosodic parses among the five
versions. The test story contained 23 sentences (385 words) ranging in length from 3
to 36 words. For reference, the test sentences are included in an appendix with the
phrase predictions of our best system.
Prosodic phrase breaks were hand-labeled in the entire corpus; the training set
labels were used for estimating the parameters of the model and test set labels were
used for evaluating the performance of the model. The prosodic phrase labeling system
used break indices marked between each pair of words, based on auditory perceptual
judgments (that is, the labelers did not have access to spectrogram or pitch displays).
The break indices ranged on a scale of 0 to 6, chosen to map to a superset of the
prosodic hierarchies proposed in the literature. The labeling scheme is described in
more detail in Price, Ostendorf, Shattuck-Hufnagel, and Fong (1991). Six of the stories
were labeled by polling two listeners who discussed any discrepancies. The remaining
stories were labeled by a third listener working independently. Comparing the labels
of one story using both schemes showed that there was a high degree of consistency
across labelers. For the full seven-level labeling system, the correlation between the
two sets of labels was 0.93, where correlation is computed as the maximum likelihood
estimate of the correlation coefficient based on the two sets of labels. Only 1% of the
labels differed by 2, and these were at locations where the disagreement was actually
over the location of the boundary rather than the relative strength of the boundary.
In this work we considered only a three-level hierarchy and therefore mapped breaks
0-2 to &amp;quot;no break,&amp;quot; 3 to a &amp;quot;minor break&amp;quot; (I), 4 and 5 to a &amp;quot;major break&amp;quot; (II) and 6 to a

4.2 Evaluation Methods
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999928666666667">
The goal of this algorithm is to predict placement of phrase breaks that sound natural
to listeners and that communicate the intended meaning of the sentence. As men-
tioned above, many renditions of a sentence can fulfill this criterion. Therefore, we
have attempted to estimate system performance by comparing the predicted breaks to
parses observed in five spoken versions of the sentence. Although the ultimate test of
the algorithm is in a speech synthesis system, a quantitative measure of system per-
formance is useful in algorithm development and comparison. We have considered
four performance measures in this work.
Since one incorrectly assigned break could make a whole sentence or clause un-
acceptable, one measure of system performance is the number of sentences with a
predicted parse that matches entirely a parse observed in any of the five spoken ver-
sions. When such a match occurs, we call the predicted parse &amp;quot;correct.&amp;quot; The five spoken
versions do not represent an exhaustive set of acceptable parses, however. Therefore
in a separate evaluation, the sentence is also judged subjectively to determine whether
it is an &amp;quot;acceptable&amp;quot; parse. The number of sentences that fall into these two categories

are reported separately, and for the best case system are marked separately in the
results in the appendix.
In order to better understand the system performance, we have chosen to com-
pute additional error measures based on the prediction accuracy at individual break
locations. A predicted sentence is compared to each of the five spoken versions, and
the closest spoken version is used as the reference for that sentence. (The closeness
of parses is measured using a Euclidean distance with 0 for no break, 1 for minor
break and 2 for major break.) Then the correspondence between predicted and ob-
served breaks is tabulated in a confusion matrix. Sentence breaks are deterministically
assigned at periods, but these are included in the performance results reported here
(as major breaks) to be consistent with results reported elsewhere. Also, note that con-
fusion tables for different systems sometimes reflect different numbers of observed
minor and major breaks because the predicted sentences may best match different
versions of the test sentence.
It is also useful to have a simple measure for comparing systems. One possible
performance figure is the overall percent correct, but we have found this measure to
be difficult to interpret because the overall figure is dominated by the performance
on the much more frequent &amp;quot;no break&amp;quot; locations. Instead, we compute the correct
prediction and false prediction rate for breaks as a combined class (merging minor
and major breaks). Using terminology from detection theory, these are also referred to
as correct detection (CD) and false detection (FD) in the following sections. CD/FD
results must be interpreted with some caution, because there is a trade-off between the
two error rates: higher break detection rates are associated with a higher rate of false
break insertion. If the insertion rate is too high, there will be few good parses at the
sentence level. We have therefore tried to control the insertion rate as much as possible
for the different systems evaluated. Two types of CD/FD results are reported. One
figure is computed based on comparison to the nearest sentence of the five versions.
In addition, since other research results have been reported based on comparison to
only one spoken version, we include correct prediction and false prediction rates that
correspond to the average rates over the five separate test versions. In general, the
correct prediction rates using the single version comparison are roughly 10% lower
than using the comparison to five versions, so comparison to one version significantly
underestimates performance of the algorithms. The variation in error rate over the
five versions is relatively small, as shown later in the discussion of speaker-dependent
effects.

Several experiments using different sets of questions to train the embedded decision
trees were performed in order to compare the relative merits of different information in
the hierarchical model, as well as trade-offs associated with computational complexity.
The entire set of questions is listed below. All experiments included questions 1-8,
which were based on features that were relatively straightforward to extract from text,
using a table look-up to assign part-of-speech labels. Experiments that made use of
syntactic features also allowed questions 9-13. The syntax experiments were based
on trees that were trained using only 14 of the 20 stories, since skeletal parses were
only available for these stories. Another set of experiments included question 14, which
tested the ratio of the current minor phrase length to the previous minor phrase length.
Finally, experiments that made use of the more detailed POS classifications included
question 15, and used the additional particle category in question 3. All questions
were based on features derived from text information only.

Below we enumerate the questions used in the different tree design experiments,
together with the motivation for each question.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.973831951219512">
1. Is this a sentence or major phrase boundary? Assuming major breaks occur at
qualitatively different locations than minor breaks, we effectively remove
the major breaks and sentences from our training corpus with this
question.
2. Is the left word a content word and the right word a function word? In the
training data, 65% of the minor and major breaks combined occur at
content word/function word (CW/FW) boundaries, and about half of the
CW/FW boundaries are marked with breaks. The CW/FW boundaries
also correspond to the prosodic group boundaries used deterministically
in Sorin, Larreur, and Llorca (1987) and in Veilleux et al. (1990).
3. What is the function word type of the word to the right? Previous work in
prosodic parsing with a small dictionary (Sorin, Larreur, and Llorca
1987) suggested that different types of function words may be more or
less likely to signal a prosodic phrase break.
4. Is either adjacent word a proper name (capitalized)? Preliminary examination
of our data suggested there was some relationship between proper
nouns and phrase boundaries, probably related to the phrasing of
complex nominals.
5. How many content words have occurred since the previous function word?
Speakers seemed to insert phrase breaks when a string of content words
became long, e.g., exceeded four or five words.
6. Is there a comma at this location? Usually, but not always, a major phrase
break occurs at locations orthographically transcribed with commas.
7. What is the relative location in the sentence (in eighths)? Previous work (Gee
and Grosjeari 1983) has suggested that prosodic phrase boundaries tend
to bisect a longer unit. Therefore, one of the questions used to partition
the training data is the ratio of the word number over the sentence
length, quantized to the nearest eighth.
8. What is the relative location in the proposed major phrase (in eighths)? This
question is included following the same reasoning as the previous
question.
9. VVhat is the largest syntactic unit that dominates the word preceding the potential
boundary location and not dominating the succeeding word? Phrase breaks are
known to co-occur with certain syntactic configurations. For example,
phrase breaks often occur before subordinate clauses.
10. What is the largest syntactic unit that dominates the word succeeding the
potential boundary location and not dominating the preceding word? The
rationale behind this question is similar to that of the previous question.
H. What is the smallest syntactic unit that dominates both? Some syntactic units
may be less likely to be broken up by a phrase break.
12. How many syntactic units end between the two words? This question provides

13. How many syntactic units begin between the two words? This question is
similar to the previous one, except that it captures effects associated with
the start of new constituents.
14. How large is the ratio of the current minor phrase length over the previous minor
phrase length? This question incorporates the concept of balancing minor
phrase lengths noted by other researchers (Gee and Grosjean 1983;
Bachenko and Fitzpatrick 1990), and was found to be useful in phrase
prediction trees investigated by Wang and Hirschberg (1992). In the
beginning of a sentence where there is no previous minor phrase, the
ratio is treated as missing data and handled using a surrogate variable
(Breiman, Friedman, Olshen, and Stone 1984).
15. What is the label of the content word to the right? to the left? Wang and
Hirschberg found that part-of-speech information is useful in phrase
break prediction (Wang and Hirschberg 1992).

Questions 5, 12, 13, and 14 are based on numerical features, so the binary ques-
tion asks whether the feature is greater than some threshold, where the threshold is
determined automatically in tree design. All other questions are based on categorical
variables, and the best binary groupings of the possible values are determined auto-
matically (Breimart, Friedman, Olshen, and Stone 1984). Two of the questions (8, 14)
require knowledge of major or minor phrase boundaries. This information is available
in the training data or from a spoken utterance, but hypothesized locations of minor
and major phrase breaks must be used in phrase prediction from text. Therefore, these
features are calculated dynamically in the prediction algorithm for each hypothesized
prosodic parse.
The first tree designed used only the very simple information represented by
questions 1-8. The resulting tree is shown in Figure 2, with the relative frequency of a
break in the training data included at each node. The first split trivially locates the sen-
tence and major break boundaries. The second split utilized the content word/function
word boundary question that we had used deterministically in previous work (Veilleux
et al. 1990). The content/function word boundaries seem to be important in other al-
gorithms as well: they correspond closely to the phi-phrase boundaries that would be
predicted by the Bachenko—Fitzpatrick algorithm, and they seem to be captured in the
Wang—Hirschberg text-only tree by a succession of questions about the part-of-speech
labels of the words adjacent to the break. Of the boundaries that were preceded by
a content word and followed by a function word, 30% were hand-labeled as minor
breaks, whereas only 4% of other locations were labeled as minor breaks and these
were identified by the next question as coinciding with a comma. The complete tree
was relatively small (9 nodes), and used almost all questions provided. On the training
data, the resulting tree classified 89% of the nonbreaks correctly and 59% of the minor
breaks correctly. All sentence and major breaks were given in the tree design.
The next stage was to incorporate syntactic information (questions 9-13) into the
tree design algorithm to determine minor phrase probabilities. Syntactic parses were
available for only 14 of the 20 training stories (2.17 sentences, 4,230 words), and the tree
was designed using this subset. A very simple five-node tree was designed, as shown
in Figure 3. Again the first nontrivial question was concerning the content/function
word boundaries, and the presence of a comma was again used to predict minor
breaks at other locations. The two other questions in the tree were based on which
syntactic unit dominated one or the other words at the boundary site. The tree design
algorithm chose syntactic units that were less likely to contain a boundary as: words

in the same constituent, words separated by a wh-noun phrase boundary, and words
separated by a verb phrase initial boundary. (In their work on spontaneous speech,
Wang and Hirschberg found that noun phrases in general tended to be less likely
to contain boundaries.) The tree with syntactic information seemed to classify minor
breaks with slightly higher accuracy than the previous tree: 90% correct classification
of nonbreaks and 62% correct classification of minor breaks in the training data.
A third tree, illustrated in Figure 4, was grown using the first 8 baseline questions
and question 14, which examines the ratio of current minor phrase length to previous
minor phrase length. The motivation behind this question is constituent balancing, as
mentioned earlier. The main difference between this tree and the first one is that the
minor phrase length ratio test is chosen instead of the question about the position in a
major phrase. These two questions served similar roles, as evidenced by the fact that
the surrogate variable for the ratio test was the location of the current word within

data for this tree were 87% for nonbreaks and 66% for minor breaks. A fourth tree
was designed using the first fourteen questions, and performance was similar to that
for the third tree.
The decision tree design algorithm&apos;s performance was not significantly changed
by the introduction of additional features. New features can supplant previously used
ones, as also found by Wang and Hirschberg (1992), because of the redundancy in
information between features. For example, in the syntax trees, many of the baseline
questions were no longer chosen, but the overall classification performance was similar.

that syntactic information did not improve the performance of the algorithm, and in

The difference in performance cannot be attributed to the smaller amount of training

of a role in location of major breaks as opposed to the minor breaks predicted in the
tree. As we shall see later, syntactic cues were useful in our implementations of the
Bachenko-Fitzpatrick and Wang-Hirschberg algorithms. We also found that the minor
phrase length ratio test hurt performance, which is likely due to the fact that the ra-
tios are based on hypothesized boundary locations in phrase prediction, as opposed
to the known locations used in training. In examining the confusion matrices, we see
the main effect of the additional syntactic and minor phrase length ratio questions is
more errors at minor phrase boundary locations.
Examining the sentence level performance of the algorithms, we find that a phrase
break was inserted between the verb and the particle in three of the six unacceptable

parses (e.g., tried I out, plugs I in, and check I in). This is not surprising since the simple
POS labeling scheme labels the particle as a preposition. The trees using syntactic
information were not able to overcome this effect because of the relative sparsity
of particles in the training data (only 5% of the words labeled as prepositions are
particles). Other mistakes included a misplaced minor phrase and a deleted major
phrase where a comma occurs in the original text. Most of the sentences that were
correct (had an exact match with one of the spoken versions) were shorter in length.
However, there were several long sentences judged to have acceptable parses. Since
many more variations in prosodic phrasing are allowable for longer sentences, it is

predicted breaks for the best system, the hierarchical model based on questions 1-8,
are shown in the Appendix together with the closest spoken prosodic parse.
In tree design, we chose to represent major breaks as a separate category that the
tree was not explicitly designed to detect. A consequence of this choice is that there
are fewer &amp;quot;break&amp;quot; data points for training the tree, since there are less than half as
many minor breaks as major breaks in the training data. This choice is reasonable if
the two breaks occur at qualitatively different locations, which we suspect. In fact,
results using trees that were trained by merging major and minor breaks into a single
category and then embedded in the hierarchical model had either lower prediction
accuracy or a higher false prediction rate. Another consequence of using only minor
breaks to train the tree is that features that are associated with major breaks are not
represented in the model, which may explain the poor performance of the model with
syntax. However, this problem could be addressed with an extension of the current
model.
In order to see if explicit modeling of a prosodic hierarchy was a useful aspect
of the model, we conducted similar experiments using trees designed specifically for
classification. A binary decision tree was trained using the baseline questions (1-8),
and another tree was trained using syntax as well (1-13). In both cases, the trees were
trained to predict three classes: major break, minor break, and no break. Including the
minor phrase length ratio test using known break locations (from hand labels) did not
improve prediction performance, so we did not implement a dynamic version based
on hypothesized minor breaks. Results for these two trees are included in Table 2, with
confusion matrices given in Table 5. The costs of different errors were chosen to obtain
a false detection rate similar to that for the hierarchical model. Choosing good costs
proved difficult, so the correct detection rate is lower than that for the other models
primarily because the false detection rate was so low. The difference in false detection
rates makes comparison to the hierarchical model difficult. However, experience with
performance of the models at different false detection rates suggests that the baseline
hierarchical model outperforms the classification tree that does not use syntax, but that
the classification tree that uses syntax is at least as good as the hierarchical model.
Since the complexity associated with obtaining a syntactic parse is significantly greater
than that associated with the simple three-level hierarchy that we have proposed, we
conclude that explicit modeling of a hierarchy is a useful feature of the model. In
addition, the fact that syntactic information was useful for the classification tree but
not for the hierarchical model suggests that syntactic features are more important for
predicting major breaks than minor breaks, since major breaks are not represented as
a class in tree design for the hierarchical model.
For both the hierarchical model and the simple classification trees, we also inves-
tigated the use of more detailed part-of-speech information both with and without

the syntactic features. The more detailed part-of-speech did not improve performance
under any of these conditions. For the classification trees, correct detection improved
slightly, but there was a corresponding increase in false detection. For the hierarchi-
cal model, performance actually degraded. These results suggest that the complexity
associated with more detailed part-of-speech tagging may not be necessary; however,
further research is needed to answer this question. It may be that other POS questions,
such as testing a larger window of words around the break as in Wang and Hirschberg
(1992), would yield better results.
Finally, we thought it would be interesting to compare the results of our predic-
tion algorithm to that of Bachenko and Fitzpatrick&apos;s algorithm on our corpus. Since
the test set was relatively small, we were able to implement the algorithm by predict-
ing the phrase boundaries from the rules by hand. To assign node indices to prosodic
breaks (Bachenko and Fitzpatrick 1990), a critical value for separating major and mi-
nor phrase breaks is calculated based on an average of the indices associated with the
prosodic phrase nodes, where the prosodic phrase nodes are all those created by the
Bachenko—Fitzpatrick primary salience rules. Boundaries with an index greater than
the critical value are assigned a major break, indices below 5 have no prosodic break,
and intermediate indices map to a minor prosodic break. (Bachenko and Fitzpatrick
include index 4 in the minor break category, but 5 was used here to obtain a lower in-
sertion rate.) For multiple verb phrases in sequence, the verb balancing rule is applied
left-to-right until all verb phrases are grouped before applying the verb adjacency rule
or other processing. The confusion matrix for these results is shown in Table 6, and the
performance summary is also included in Table 2. Although the correct break detection
rate is significantly higher than that for the other algorithms, the false detection rate is
also higher, and so the sentence accuracy is similar to that for the baseline hierarchical
model. Unlike the other algorithms, the Bachenko—Fitzpatrick algorithm did not make
the mistake of assigning a minor phrase break before a particle, but this relies on
having a parser that can make that distinction. An advantage of both the classification
tree and the hierarchical model over the Bachenko—Fitzpatrick model is that they can
be automatically trained, and thus can be tuned to handle particular tasks.
Table 7 gives the correct detection and false detection rates calculated by compar-
ing the predicted prosodic parses to each of the different spoken versions. The perfor-
mance of speaker f2b, whose speech made up roughly three-quarters of the training
data, had performance similar to the average for the five versions with slightly lower
correct detection rates but also slightly lower false detection rates. These results sug-
gest that the automatic algorithms are not particularly speaker-dependent, though we
expect that it is important to have similar styles for both training and test data. There
was no consistent difference in performance between male and female speakers, and
the difference in error rates for different speakers was relatively small.

In all of the previous experiments, the presence of a comma was an important fea-
ture for predicting phrase boundaries for all algorithms implemented. While this is a
valid feature in text-to-speech synthesis applications, it is not available in applications
involving spoken speech. (Although presence of a pause might be a useful alternative
feature.) In addition, as we have mentioned earlier, commas are not reliably used even
in written text. Therefore, it is interesting to determine the performance of the algo-
rithm without the comma feature. As expected, performance degrades significantly,
both for the hierarchical model and for the classification trees. In addition, foy the
hierarchical model, syntactic information and the minor phrase length ratio test now
provide information that improves performance over the baseline system. To illustrate
performance differences, some correct prediction/false prediction rates are given in
Table 8.
It is difficult to compare our performance figures with other reported results
because of differences in corpora and speaking styles. However, the average single
speaker correct detection and false detection rates reported here for our implementa-
tions of the Bachenko-Fitzpatrick and Wang-Hirschberg algorithms indicate the ro-
bustness of these algorithms to different types of data. Our results for the Bachenko-
Fitzpatrick algorithm are somewhat higher than those that they report, .84/.09 vs.

fication trees to predict prosodic boundaries in spontaneous speech, achieving phrase

<bodyText confidence="0.999993142857143">
In summary, the model proposed here addresses several issues in modeling prosodic
phrase structure. The model is a general formalism for an embedded hierarchy, which
represents a unit in terms of the probability of the sequence of subunits comprising
it. The model is specifically applied to represent a hierarchy containing sentences,
major phrases, and minor phrases. The model captures grammatical and constituent
length factors through the use of a decision tree, as in Wang and Hirschberg (1992),
but embedding the tree within a hierarchical structure yields better performance than
that achieved by a decision tree alone. The model is stochastic, which accounts for
the natural variability in prosodic parsing, and can be automatically trained to reflect
different speaking styles. The automatic training algorithm described here, based on
maximum likelihood estimation, involves simple relative frequency estimates and de-
cision tree design. Automatic training on a large corpus to design the best predictors of
phrase breaks can also provide new insight into the relationship between prosody and
syntax. Using the stochastic model, prosodic phrase break prediction involves choos-
ing the most likely prosodic parse, which can be achieved using a recursive dynamic
programming algorithm. We have found that good phrase break prediction results can
be achieved without the use of syntactic information or detailed part-of-speech labels,
resulting in a very low complexity prediction algorithm. Without syntax, our algo-
rithm predicted a good prosodic parse for 18 out of 23 sentences, which corresponds
to a correct break prediction of 81% and a false prediction rate of 4%.
There are many ways in which this work could be extended. As we have pointed
out, it would be useful to use features directly in determining the probability of a unit,
rather than simply representing a unit in terms of the probabilities of the subunits. For
example, we conjecture that commas and certain syntactic structures might be good
predictors of major phrase breaks, but not minor phrase breaks. In addition, other
features could be used in the model, including different syntactic features and differ-
ent questions about the more detailed part-of-speech labels. Automatically predicted
prominence (or pitch accent) locations might also be useful in phrase boundary pre-
diction, although it is arguable whether prominence prediction should come before or
after boundary placement. Of course, it would also be interesting to consider a higher
order hierarchy, though we anticipate that a successful implementation would require
representation of features at the different levels. The results reported here were limited
to some extent by the amount of available data. A larger training set would enable
the study of more factors, including possibly paragraph-level phenomena. A larger
test set would better establish the significance of the results. Finally, the best test of a
phrase break prediction algorithm is in perceptual judgments of synthesized speech,
and we would like to evaluate our algorithm in this context.
In this work we have focused on the synthesis application of prosodic phrase break
prediction. However, one of the advantages of a stochastic model is that it may be use-
ful for analysis of spoken speech. Because there is some relationship between prosody
and syntax, prosodic phrase structure can be used to improve the performance and/or
speed of speech understanding systems. For example, a score of the consistency be-

tween a syntactic parse and a prosodic parse has been used to resolve ambiguities
in sentence interpretation, where the score is computed by comparing automatically
detected prosodic phrase breaks to phrase breaks predicted from the text of the dif-
ferent interpretations (Ostendorf, Wightman, and Veilleux 1993). Another approach to
syntactic disambiguation using prosodic information is described in Bear and Price
(1990) and Ostendorf, Price, Bear, and Wightman (1990), where prosodic breaks are
used to constrain grammar rules in a parser. A stochastic phrase model could also be
used to improve performance of this system simply by serving as a &amp;quot;language model&amp;quot;
(as in speech recognition) to improve the performance of a detection algorithm using
acoustic information.

<abstract confidence="0.969510916666667">Prosodic phrase structure provides important information for the understanding and naturalness of synthetic speech, and a good model of prosodic phrases has applications in both speech synthesis and speech understanding. This work describes a statistical model of an embedded hierarchy of prosodic phrase structure, motivated by results in linguistic theory. Each level of the hierarchy is modeled as a sequence of subunits at the next level, with the lowest level of the hierarchy representing factors such as syntactic branching and prosodic constituent length using a binary tree classification. A maximum likelihood solution for parameter estimation is presented, allowing automatic training of different speaking styles. For predicting prosodic phrase breaks from text, a dynamic programming algorithm is given for finding the maximum probability prosodic parse. Experimental results on a corpus of radio news demonstrate a high rate of success for predicting major and minor phrase boundaries from text without syntactic information (81% correct prediction with 4% false prediction).</abstract>

The relationship between prosody and syntax is not fully understood, though it is generally accepted that there is such a relationship. For example, relatively higher syntactic attachment usually corresponds to relatively larger prosodic breaks, but there are many exceptions, as in: (iMaryinp [was amazed [Ann Dewey was angrylnipis which was produced by four speakers as Mary was amazed H Ann Dewey was angry. In an analysis of the London—Lund corpus, Altenberg (1987) finds relative frequencies that describe the correspondence between prosodic constituents (tone units) and different syntactic units. This data supports the use of a probabilistic model, which also has an advantage in that it can be trained automatically, facilitating representation of a wide variety of speaking styles and allowing a means of discovering syntax-prosody relationships from a large corpus. One reason that the mapping between syntax and prosody is not simple is because, in speech, the constraints of syntactic structure and phrase length are balanced to produce a regular, roughly </context>

Altenberg (1987) has also proposed an algorithm for prediction of phrase boundary locations (specifically, tone unit boundaries for British English) by rule from syntactic structure and semantic information. However, the detailed information required for the algorithm cannot currently be acquired automatically from text.

In the current work, we make several simplifying assumptions due to training limitations. First, the probability of the number of subunits in a unit p(n,ILI,) is assumed to depend only on the number of words in the unit i(U). As is not surprising, our data indicate that units that span a larger number of words tend to comprise more subunits. Altenberg has noticed similar tendencies in the London—Lund corpus (Altenberg 1987, p. 81). (Alternatively, it has been suggested that either phonological word count or stressed syllable count rather than orthographic word count may be a useful measure of phrase length on the lowest level [Bachenko and Fitzpatrick 19901.) In addition, the probability distribution is approximated by conditioning on quantized lengths Qu(k(U,)). The quantizer varies as a function of the specific unit and is designed using a regression tree (Breiman, Friedman, Olshen, and Stone 1984).

Since these are hand-corrected parses, the results are indicative of the performance possible using syntactic information, but do not reflect performance achievable with an existing parser. Several researchers have investigated the relationship between prosody and syntax (e.g., Selkirk 1984; Gee and Grosjean 1983; Cooper and Paccia-Cooper 1980; Altenberg 1987). Our features have been motivated by some of these results, which suggest that some syntactic constituents are more likely to be separated by a phrase break than others. However, we have chosen to let the important constituents be determined automatically, similar to Wang and Hirschberg (1992), rather than by rule. One feature is the highest syntactic constituent dominating the left word but not dominating the right word, which describes potential locations for phrase breaks after a specific syntactic constituent.

It may be that other POS questions, such as testing a larger window of words around the break as in Wang and Hirschberg (1992), would yield better results. Finally, we thought it would be interesting to compare the results of our prediction algorithm to that of Bachenko and Fitzpatrick&apos;s algorithm on our corpus. Since the test set was relatively small, we were able to implement the algorithm by predicting the phrase boundaries from the rules by hand. To assign node indices to prosodic breaks (Bachenko and Fitzpatrick 1990), a critical value for separating major and minor phrase breaks is calculated based on an average of the indices associated with the prosodic phrase nodes, where the prosodic phrase nodes are all those created by the Bachenko—Fitzpatrick primary salience rules. Boundaries with an index greater than the critical value are assigned a major break, indices below 5 have no prosodic break, and intermediate indices map to a minor prosodic break.

Third, prosodic phrase breaks do not always coincide with syntactic phrase boundaries, and the relationship between prosody and syntax is not well understood. This means that prosodic phrases cannot simply be predicted from syntactic structure. Finally, since most text-to-speech synthesis applications require a low cost implementation, there is the concern of computational complexity. We shall expand on these points separately below, to motivate the work described here. The various linguistic theories of prosodic phrase structure (e.g., Liberman and Prince 1977; Selkirk 1980, 1984; Beckman and Pierrehumbert 1986; Nespor and Vogel 1983; Ladd 1986) differ in the specific levels that they represent, but all have a similar hierarchical structure. Two levels of prosodic phrases are common to most proposals: the intonational phrase and the intermediate phrase, using the terminology of Beckman and Pierrehumbert. A sentence is composed of a sequence of intonational phrases, which in turn are composed of sequences of intermediate phrases. An intonational phrase break is therefore perceived as stronger or more salient than an intermediate phrase break. Intonational phrases are delimited by boundary tones, and </context>

It might be useful to consider phonological words rather than orthographic words as possible sites for break indices. This could be accomplished, without using deterministic rules, by specifying the bottom of the hierarchy (e.g., break level 0) to represent locations internal to a phonological word and the next level of the hierarchy (e.g., break level I) to represent phonological word boundaries. However, it is controversial as to whether phonological words can be larger or smaller than orthographic (lexical) words (Booij 1983; Nespor and Vogel 1983), so it is not clear how the lowest level should be defined relative to the orthographic words. In this work, we have chosen not to distinguish between these two levels, to reduce the complexity of implementation and performance evaluation. For similar reasons, we have limited comprises syntactically well-formed sentences.

This data supports the use of a probabilistic model, which also has an advantage in that it can be trained automatically, facilitating representation of a wide variety of speaking styles and allowing a means of discovering syntax-prosody relationships from a large corpus. One reason that the mapping between syntax and prosody is not simple is because, in speech, the constraints of syntactic structure and phrase length are balanced to produce a regular, roughly equal, sequence of prosodic phrases (Gee and Grosjean 1983). Consequently, we include constituent length as a factor in the model. The cost of obtaining a full and accurate syntactic parse can be high, which presents difficulties for text-to-speech synthesis systems. In addition, a full syntactic parse may not be necessary for predicting prosodic phrases, since prosody is not directly related to syntax. Consequently, we investigate computation/performance trade-offs associated with using a skeletal syntactic parse vs. simple part-of-speech (POS) assignments. To summarize, the model proposed here addresses several issues in modeling prosodic phrase str</context>

Motivated by similar principles and using only a 300-word dictionary, O&apos;Shaughnessy (1989) proposes a somewhat more sophisticated parser for English based on function word identification, number agreement, and suffix identification. O&apos;Shaughnessy&apos;s work differs from the other approaches in that his goal is a syntactic parse, though not complete, and he does not address the issue of differences between prosody and syntax. At the other end of the spectrum are approaches based on the hypothesis that prosodic phrase boundaries can be predicted by rule from a full syntactic parse. Gee and Grosjean (1983) developed a rule-based system, called the Phi Algorithm, to predict psycholinguistic &amp;quot;performance structures&amp;quot; that are represented by assigning an integer number corresponding to boundary salience between each pair of words. Constituent length information is incorporated primarily through the application of their verb balancing rule, which splits the verb phrase and groups the verb with either the previous or subsequent material, subject to syntactic constraints. Gee and Grosjean developed their Phi Algorithm only to predict performance structures. However, their work has been extended to pro</context>

Both types of constituents are also cued by segmental lengthening in the phrase final syllable (Wightman, Shattuck-Hufnagel, Ostendorf, and Price 1992). Since intonational and intermediate phrases are generally accepted, the experiments here will only address these two levels, referring to them as major and minor phrases, respectively. However, other types of prosodic constituents may be useful and, in fact, there is durational evidence for at least four levels (Wightman, Shattuck-Hufnagel, Ostendorf, and Price 1991; Ladd and Campbell 1991). We therefore propose a more general hierarchical model that can be extended to an arbitrary, but fixed, number of levels.

In the current work, we make several simplifying assumptions due to training limitations. First, the probability of the number of subunits in a unit p(n,ILI,) is assumed to depend only on the number of words in the unit i(U). As is not surprising, our data indicate that units that span a larger number of words tend to comprise more subunits.

Experimental results on a corpus of radio news demonstrate a high rate of success for predicting major and minor phrase boundaries from text without syntactic information (81% correct prediction with 4% false prediction). 1. Introduction Prosodic phrase structure plays a role in both naturalness and intelligibility of speech. For example, prosodic phrase boundaries break the flow of a sentence, dividing it into smaller units for easier processing. In addition, researchers have shown that prosodic phrase break placement is important in syntactic disambiguation (Lehiste 1973; Price, Ostendorf, Shattuck-Hufnagel, and Fong 1991). For these reasons, computational modeling of prosodic phrases is important both for text-to-speech synthesis and speech understanding applications. In this work, we present a computational model that represents a hierarchy of prosodic constituents using a stochastic formalism to capture the natural variability allowable in prosodic phrasing. The model is useful for both analysis and synthesis applications; we focus on synthesis here, and present experimental results for predicting prosodic phrase structure from text.

However, it is controversial as to whether phonological words can be larger or smaller than orthographic (lexical) words (Booij 1983; Nespor and Vogel 1983), so it is not clear how the lowest level should be defined relative to the orthographic words.

Our earlier work drew on this scheme for predicting phrase boundaries in English: a Markov model was developed to predict phrase breaks by representing the sequence of prosodic groups and breaks as a Markov chain (Veilleux, Ostendorf, Price, and Shattuck-Hufnagel 1990). An advantage of these approaches is that they only require a small dictionary of function words to assign part-of-speech labels. Motivated by similar principles and using only a 300-word dictionary, O&apos;Shaughnessy (1989) proposes a somewhat more sophisticated parser for English based on function word identification, number agreement, and suffix identification. O&apos;Shaughnessy&apos;s work differs from the other approaches in that his goal is a syntactic parse, though not complete, and he does not address the issue of differences between prosody and syntax. At the other end of the spectrum are approaches based on the hypothesis that prosodic phrase boundaries can be predicted by rule from a full syntactic parse. Gee and Grosjean (1983) developed a rule-based system, called the Phi Algorithm, to predict psycholinguisti</context>

Although using commas deterministically to assign a major phrase boundary yields better performance on our test set than using commas as a feature, we felt that using commas as a feature was a more extensible approach, and have used this strategy in the results reported here. Including commas as a feature does improve performance relative to not using commas, as will be discussed in Section 4. Commas (and other punctuation) can be very useful for prosodic boundary prediction when they are available, and they are used in other algorithms (e.g., Allen, Hunnicutt, and Klatt 1987; O&apos;Shaughnessy 1989; I3achenko and Fitzpatrick 1990). However, commas are not reliably transcribed from spoken language and not consistently used in written text, so it is important that the algorithm not depend too heavily on commas. 35 Computational Linguistics Volume 20, Number I Syntactic features were extracted from skeletal parses provided through a preliminary version of the Penn Treebank Corpus.

Third, prosodic phrase breaks do not always coincide with syntactic phrase boundaries, and the relationship between prosody and syntax is not well understood. This means that prosodic phrases cannot simply be predicted from syntactic structure. Finally, since most text-to-speech synthesis applications require a low cost implementation, there is the concern of computational complexity. We shall expand on these points separately below, to motivate the work described here. The various linguistic theories of prosodic phrase structure (e.g., Liberman and Prince 1977; Selkirk 1980, 1984; Beckman and Pierrehumbert 1986; Nespor and Vogel 1983; Ladd 1986) differ in the specific levels that they represent, but all have a similar hierarchical structure. Two levels of prosodic phrases are common to most proposals: the intonational phrase and the intermediate phrase, using the terminology of Beckman and Pierrehumbert. A sentence is composed of a sequence of intonational phrases, which in turn are composed of sequences of intermediate phrases. An intonational phrase break is therefore perceived as stronger or more salient than an intermediate phrase break. Intonational phrases</context>

Is the left word a content word and the right word a function word? In the training data, 65% of the minor and major breaks combined occur at content word/function word (CW/FW) boundaries, and about half of the CW/FW boundaries are marked with breaks. The CW/FW boundaries also correspond to the prosodic group boundaries used deterministically in Sorin, Larreur, and Llorca (1987) and in Veilleux et al. (1990). 3. What is the function word type of the word to the right? Previous work in prosodic parsing with a small dictionary (Sorin, Larreur, and Llorca 1987) suggested that different types of function words may be more or less likely to signal a prosodic phrase break. 4.

The second split utilized the content word/function word boundary question that we had used deterministically in previous work (Veilleux et al. 1990). The content/function word boundaries seem to be important in other algorithms as well: they correspond closely to the phi-phrase boundaries that would be predicted by the Bachenko—Fitzpatrick algorithm, and they seem to be captured in the Wang—Hirschberg text-only tree by a succession of questions about the part-of-speech labels of the words adjacent to the break. Of the boundaries that were preceded by a content word and followed by a function word, 30% were hand-labeled as minor breaks, whereas only 4% of other locations were labeled as minor breaks and these were identified by the next qu</context>

One of the relaxed constraints obviates the need for clause information. Altenberg (1987) has also proposed an algorithm for prediction of phrase boundary locations (specifically, tone unit boundaries for British English) by rule from syntactic structure and semantic information. However, the detailed information required for the algorithm cannot currently be acquired automatically from text. Departing from these approaches, Wang and Hirschberg (1992) have recently used binary decision trees to predict the presence or absence of a prosodic break at each word boundary in a sentence. They consider a range of input variables, including textderived information such as detailed POS labels and syntactic constituent structure, and in some experiments, acoustic information. POS labels were given by Church&apos;s tagger (Church 1988) and syntactic constituents by Hindle&apos;s parser (Hindle 1987). The acoustic information (previous boundary location, pitch accent location, and phrase duration), which was based on hand-labeled prosodic markers, did not impro</context>

Details on our specific choice of features and questions is given in Section 4. Our use of decision trees is different from the phrase break detection algorithm of Wang and Hirschberg (1992), although the tree design algorithm and choice of features is similar. The tree is not used to classify phrase breaks directly; instead it is used to determine the probability of the occurrence of a minor break at some location, conditioned on the decision tree structure. This probability is used to represent the lowest level in the hierarchical model. Previously, we mentioned two important factors affecting the placement of phrase breaks: (1) grammatical structure and (2) length constraints on the prosodic constituents such as overall length and length relative to neighboring phrases.

We also consider the similar case, the highest syntactic constituent dominating the right word but not the left, to allow for prosodic phrase breaks that may be associated with the beginning of a syntactic constituent.

This question incorporates the concept of balancing minor phrase lengths noted by other researchers (Gee and Grosjean 1983; Bachenko and Fitzpatrick 1990), and was found to be useful in phrase prediction trees investigated by Wang and Hirschberg (1992). In the beginning of a sentence where there is no previous minor phrase, the ratio is treated as missing data and handled using a surrogate variable (Breiman, Friedman, Olshen, and Stone 1984). 15.

Classification rates on the training data for this tree were 87% for nonbreaks and 66% for minor breaks. A fourth tree was designed using the first fourteen questions, and performance was similar to that for the third tree. The decision tree design algorithm&apos;s performance was not significantly changed by the introduction of additional features. New features can supplant previously used ones, as also found by Wang and Hirschberg (1992), because of the redundancy in information between features. For example, in the syntax trees, many of the baseline questions were no longer chosen, but the overall classification performance was similar. 4.4 Phrase Prediction Results The trees were used in the hierarchical model, and the phrase break prediction algorithm was evaluated on the independent test set described in Section 4.1.

The more detailed part-of-speech did not improve performance under any of these conditions. For the classification trees, correct detection improved slightly, but there was a corresponding increase in false detection. For the hierarchical model, performance actually degraded. These results suggest that the complexity associated with more detailed part-of-speech tagging may not be necessary; however, further research is needed to answer this question. It may be that other POS questions, such as testing a larger window of words around the break as in Wang and Hirschberg (1992), would yield better results. Finally, we thought it would be interesting to compare the results of our prediction algorithm to that of Bachenko and Fitzpatrick&apos;s algorithm on our corpus. Since the test set was relatively small, we were able to implement the algorithm by predicting the phrase boundaries from the rules by hand.
