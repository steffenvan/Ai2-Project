The last two chapters of the book form Part IV, subtitled
&amp;quot;Explorations.&amp;quot; The first of these comes as something of an
agreeable surprise, and is certainly the best chapter in the
book. The authors, Hauenschild and Busemann, investi-
gate the possibility of adapting GPSG to MT. In particular,
they address the problem of developing a &amp;quot;constructive&amp;quot; (or
constructional) version of the &amp;quot;purely axiomatic&amp;quot; version
found in Gazdar et al. (1985). Here at last is something of
an answer to the very apposite question posed by Kimmo
Kettunen (1986) in this journal.
The second chapter might have been a similar explora-
tion of LFG by Schmidt. Instead, it &amp;quot;tries to give an idea of
how to overcome some weaknesses of [EUROTRA&apos;s] CAT-
formalism . . . by relating it to LFG&amp;quot; (p. 239). The last two
sentences of the book seem to confirm the impression that
perhaps they might have done better just to start with LFG
in the first place:
This chapter was a glimpse at a theory from which a
great deal has been imported into CAT, namely LFG.
However, some of the virtues of the original have been
ignored, above all the most clever LFG mechanism, the
functional uncertainty device. (p. 250)

This volume is a collection of papers in honor of the sixtieth
birthday of Sture Allen, Chairman of the Department of
Computational Linguistics at the University of Gothen-
burg and Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy,
written by his students and colleagues. These papers appear
in excellent English but they describe work on Swedish
(although many of the authors represented here have also
worked on problems in English lexicology). The organiza-
tion of the book, in alphabetical order by last name of
author, has the effect of emphasizing the amazing breadth
of Allen&apos;s work, as we move from a paper on applications of
lexical databases in linguistics to a paper on the creation of
such a database, or from a paper on the structure of the
lexicon to a paper on how a computer program can access a
lexical database.
The problem of creating a lexical database from dictio-
nary data is discussed in three papers. Rudolf Rydstedt
gives a preliminary report on the construction of the lexical
database for the Dictionary of the Swedish Academy, a
project headed by Allen himself (comparable to the con-
struction of the new Oxford English Dictionary by the
University of Waterloo and IBM in cooperation with the
Oxford University Press). The paper includes a description
of the languages used for defining the data, the problems of
structuring fixed- and free-format text, and the question of
creating a database that can be distributed in CD-ROM
form. Sture Berg and Kaisa Samuelson exhibit the cooper-
ation between linguist and computer scientist that is such a
happy feature of this book in a description of the production
of a glossary for use in spelling correction; the major
problems are the generation of all inflected forms and the
analysis of the novel compounds that are a common feature
of modern Swedish. Rolf Gavare talks about the problem of
sorting in alphabetical order any collection of &amp;quot;words&amp;quot;
including uppercase letters, numerals, Greek and other
non-Roman characters, and logograms like percent signs
and ampersands.
A number of the papers discuss the structure of the
lexical database and desirable features of the lexical entry.
Staffan Hellberg proposes a novel classification of adjec-
tives. Martin Gellerstam and Maria Toporowska-Gronostaj
both discuss methods of representing the way verbs and
their arguments combine. Bo Ralph looks at semantic
rather than syntactic structures for verbs, concentrating
mainly on taxonomy.
Some lexical databases are created primarily for use by
other computer software; others are intended to be used by
human beings. Anna Sasvall Hein describes the lexical
database used by her parser for Swedish, a unification-
based chart parser designed for such diverse sublanguages
as news agency telegrams, medical texts, and dictionary
definitions. Christian Sjogreen describes a project, also
designed by Allen, to create a commercial dictionary from
a lexical database, complete to the writing of the printer&apos;s
tape. Gudrun Magralsclottir discusses problems of access-
ing the lexicon in the machine translation process. The
advantages of a lexical database as a source for linguistic
research are illustrated by studies of synaesthesia (Asa
Abelin), semantic change (Birgitta Ernby), and loan words
(Kerstin Noren).
Two papers of extraordinary interest span all these cate-
gories. Jerker Jarborg presents a formal structure for the
description of both syntactic and semantic features. Sven-

Goran Malmgren describes regularities in polysemy: types
of metaphoric transfer of meaning in nouns, regular exten-
sions in verb meanings, and changes in adjective meanings
as the argument changes. While these papers are written
about Swedish, they make one itch to try out these ideas on
an English corpus.

Grishman&apos;s book provides an introductory overview of the
computational linguistics field. Instructors looking for a
good introductory text to use in a course devoted to compu-
tational linguistics should consider this book as a strong
candidate if they wish to emphasize a linguistics approach.
The book consists of five sections: introduction (5%), syntax
analysis (45%), semantic analysis (29%), discourse analy-
sis and information structuring (11%), and language gener-
ation (7%), as well as a short section of 34 exercises
covering all chapters of the book. The book&apos;s emphasis
reflects the predominant trends in the field. Grishman
avoids extreme positions and gives a remarkably neutral
account. By the same token, however, students will hardly
know anything of the controversies that have shaken the
field.
Many different approaches could be taken when attempt-
ing a broad survey of computational linguistics. Artificial
intelligence could be emphasized (including accounts of
past programs), a cognitive science approach might be
attempted, or a linguistic orientation might be the main
emphasis. Grishman elects the linguistic approach, al-
though some artificial intelligence programs are discussed.
The book Natural Language Processing by Harry Tennant
(1981), which covers many Al programs, is referenced
(together with Winograd&apos;s Language as a Cognitive Pro-
cess [1983]) as a supplement in the introductory chapter.
Using both of these books together could make for a very
good course: Grishman&apos;s book provides a strong linguistic
orientation, and Tennant&apos;s book presents practice and appli-
cations. The main difficulty with using both texts together
would be the need to integrate the disparate approaches. By
taking a linguistic viewpoint, Grishman&apos;s text fails fully to
cover many different computational approaches to lan-
guage. For use in a class, the book must be supplemented.
As an example of topics not (sufficiently) covered, con-
sider case frame analysis. The text barely mentions case
frames, and the only analysis of canonical verbs with
agents, instruments, affected entity, etc., occurs in a brief
discussion of Schank&apos;s conceptual dependency theory. Any
instructor wishing to cover the large amount of computa-
tional linguistics research in this area will have to draw
more material from elsewhere.
Grishman does concentrate on the central themes of
linguistics: transformational grammar, translating surface
forms into semantic meaning structures (first-order logic
statements in this case) and, to a lesser extent, discourse
analysis.
In the syntax chapter, Grishman first asks whether syn-
tactic analysis is really necessary, since some researchers
today question the need. He observes that syntactic analy-
sis is the norm and highly useful. He also briefly addresses
the difficulty of parsing non—well-formed inputs. He then
presents the Chomsky hierarchy of grammars, regular,
context-free, and context-sensitive, followed by a rather
nice example of a context-free grammar and a parser for it.
Sections on transformational grammar and an associated
parser are covered in thorough detail. Augmented phrase-
structure grammars (including NYU&apos;s Linguistic String
Project and ATNs) are also covered. The syntax chapter
concludes with brief discussions of some specific problems:
ambiguities in attaching prepositional phrases to what they
should modify and analyzing coordinate conjunctions. The
latest advances in syntactic theory (government-binding,
X-bar syntax, etc.) have not been included. Nevertheless,
this is a very full chapter that provides quite good coverage
of syntactic parsing techniques.
The semantic analysis chapter introduces predicate logic
as the formal language into which surface forms can be
translated. Grishman also discusses shortcomings of predi-
cate logic as a representation language, after which he
mentions Montague semantics but provides no treatment.
Semantic constraints, semantic grammars, and sublan-
guages are explained briefly but well. Grishman then dis-
cusses some classic semar tic problems, including anaphora
and reference (a very nice treatment), discourse entities,
and noun phrases. The chapter concludes with an interest-
ing discussion of uses of logic as a representation language,
including deducing consequences from sentences using the-
orem provers. As with the syntax chapter, the latest hot
buttons in semantics are not treated (situation semantics,
for example, is not mentioned anywhere) but the coverage
of topics presented contains insightful discussions.
Examples are well chosen and informative. Occasionally,
the reader might wish for more extensive examples.
The syntax and semantics chapters occupy much of the
book. The chapter on discourse and structured representa-
tions is therefore rather short. Grishman reviews what we
