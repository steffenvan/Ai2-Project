<bodyText confidence="0.999448">
This demo showcases a translation service that
allows travelers to have an easy and convenient
access to Chinese-Spanish translations via a mo-
bile app. The system integrates a phrase-based
translation system with other open source compo-
nents such as Optical Character Recognition and
Automatic Speech Recognition to provide a very
friendly user experience.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999830772727273">
During the last twenty years, Machine Transla-
tion technologies have matured enough to get out
from the academic world and jump into the com-
mercial area. Current commercially available ma-
chine translation services, although still not good
enough to replace human translations, are able to
provide useful and reliable support in certain ap-
plications such as cross-language information re-
trieval, cross-language web browsing and docu-
ment exploration.
On the other hand, the increasing use of smart-
phones, their portability and the availability of in-
ternet almost everywhere, have allowed for lots of
traditional on-line applications and services to be
deployed on these mobile platforms.
In this demo paper we describe “CHISPA on the
GO” a Chinese-Spanish translation service that in-
tends to provide a portable and easy to use lan-
guage assistance tool for travelers between Chi-
nese and Spanish speaking countries.
The main three characteristics of the presented
demo system are as follows:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.992064058823529">
• First, the system uses a direct translation be-
tween Chinese and Spanish, rather than using
a pivot language as intermediate step as most
of the current commercial systems do when
dealing with distant languages.
• Second, in addition to support on-line trans-
lations, as other commercial systems, our
system also supports access from mobile
platforms, Android and iOS, by means of na-
tive mobile apps.
• Third, the mobile apps combine the base
translation technology with other supporting
technologies such as Automatic Speech
Recognition (ASR), Optical Character
Recognition (OCR), Image retrieval and
Language detection in order to provide a
friendly user experience.

The translation technology used in our system
is based on the well-known phrase-based trans-
lation statistical approach (Koehn et al., 2003).
This approach performs the translation splitting
the source sentence in segments and assigning to
each segment a bilingual phrase from a phrase-
table. Bilingual phrases are translation units that
contain source words and target words, and have
different scores associated to them. These bilin-
gual phrases are then selected in order to max-
imize a linear combination of feature functions.
Such strategy is known as the log-linear model
(Och and Ney, 2002). The two main feature func-
tions are the translation model and the target lan-
guage model. Additional models include lexical
weights, phrase and word penalty and reordering.

<bodyText confidence="0.999721875">
Generally, Chinese-Spanish translation follows
pivot approaches to be translated (Costa-juss`a et
al., 2012) because of the lack of parallel data to
train the direct approach. The main advantage
of our system is that we are using the direct ap-
proach and at the same time we rely on a pretty
large corpus. For Chinese-Spanish, we use (1) the
Holy Bible corpus (Banchs and Li, 2008), (2) the

United Nations corpus, which was released for re-
search purposes (Rafalovitch and Dale, 2009), (3)
a small subset of the European Parliament Plenary
Speeches where the Chinese part was syntheti-
cally produced by translating from English, (4) a
large TAUS corpus (TausData, 2013) which comes
from technical translation memories, and (5) an in-
house developed small corpus in the transportation
and hospitality domains. In total we have 70 mil-
lion words.
A careful preprocessing was developed for all
languages. Chinese was segmented with Stanford
segmenter (Tseng et al., 2005) and Spanish was
preprocessed with Freeling (Padr´o et al., 2010).
When Spanish is used as a source language, it is
preprocessed by lower-casing and unaccented the
input. Finally, we use the MOSES decoder (Koehn
et al., 2007) with standard configuration: align-
grow-final-and alignment symmetrization, 5-gram
language model with interpolation and kneser-ney
discount and phrase-smoothing and lexicalized re-
ordering. We use our in-house developed corpus
to optimize because our application is targeted to
the travelers-in-need domain.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.981395">
3.1.1 Back-end
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999216384615385">
As previously mentioned, our translation system
uses MOSES. More specifically, we use the open
source MOSES server application developed by
Saint-Amand (2013). Because translation tables
need to be kept permanently in memory, we use bi-
nary tables to reduce the memory space consump-
tion. The MOSES server communicates with a PHP
script that is responsible for receiving the query to
be translated and sending the translation back.
For the Chinese-Spanish language pair, we
count with four types of PHP scripts. Two of them
communicate with the web-site and the other two
with the mobile applications. In both cases, one

<bodyText confidence="0.995364727272727">
of the two PHP scripts supports Chinese to Span-
ish translations and the other one the Spanish to
Chinese translations.
The functions of the PHP scripts responsible
for supporting translations are: (1) receive the
Chinese/Spanish queries from the front-end; (2)
preprocess the Chinese/Spanish queries; (3) send
these preprocessed queries to the Chinese/Spanish
to Spanish/Chinese MOSES servers; (4) receive the
translated queries; and (5) send them back to the
front-end.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.921083">
3.1.2 Front-end
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999944444444444">
HTML and Javascript constitute the main code
components of the translation website.Another
web development technique used was Ajax, which
allows for asynchronous communication between
the MOSES server and the website. This means that
the website does not need to be refreshed after ev-
ery translation.
The HTTP protocol is used for the communica-
tions between the web and the server. Specifically,
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.995508">
34
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.99993184">
we use the POST method, in which the server re-
ceives data through the request message’s body.
The Javascript is used mainly to implement the
input methods of the website, which are a Spanish
keyboard and a Pinyin input method, both open
source and embedded into our code. Also, using
Javascript, a small delay was programmed in order
to automatically send the query to the translator
each time the user stops typing.
Another feature that is worth mentioning is the
support of user feedback to suggest better transla-
tions. Using MYSQL, we created a database in
the server where all user suggestions are stored.
Later, these suggestions can be processed off-line
and used in order to improve the system.
Additionally, all translations processed by the
system are stored in a file. This information is to
be exploited in the near future, when a large num-
ber of translations has been collected, to mine for
the most commonly requested translations. The
most common translation set will be used to im-
plement an index and search engine so that any
query entered by a user, will be first checked
against the index to avoid overloading the trans-
lation engine.

3.2 Android and iphone applications
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999957894736842">
The android app was programmed with the An-
droid development tools (ADT). It is a plug-in for
the Eclipse IDE that provides the necessary envi-
ronment for building an app.
The Android-based “CHISPA on the GO” app
is depicted in Figure 2.
For the communication between the Android
app and the server we use the HTTPClient inter-
face. Among other things, it allows a client to
send data to the server via, for instance, the POST
method, as used on the website case.
For the Iphone app we use the xcode software
provided by apple and the programming language
used is Objective C.
In addition to the base translation system, the
app also incorporates Automatic Speech Recogni-
tion (ASR), Optical Character Recognition tech-
nologies as input methods (OCR), Image retrieval
and Language detection.

images into machine-encoded text. We adapted
the open-source OCR Tesseract (released under the
Apache license) (Tesseract, 2013).

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.961823">
3.2.2 Image retrieval
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999987888888889">
For image retrieving, we use the popular website
flickr (Ludicorp, 2004). The image retrieving is
activated with an specific button ”search Image”
button in the app (see Figure 2). Then, an URL
(using the HTTPClient method) is sent to a flickr
server. In the URL we specify the tag (i.e. the
topic of the images we want), the number of im-
ages, the secret key (needed to interact with flickr)
and also the type of object we expect (in our case,
a JSON object). When the server response is re-
ceived, we parse the JSON object. Afterwards,
with the HTTPConnection method and the infor-
mation parsed, we send the URL back to the server
and we retrieve the images requested. Also, the
JAVA class that implements all these methods ex-
tends an AsyncTask in order to not block the
user interface meanwhile is exchanging informa-
tion with the flickr servers.

3.2.3 Language detection

We have also implemented a very simple but ef-
fective language detection system, which is very
suitable for distinguishing between Chinese and
Spanish. Given the type of encoding we are using

(UTF-8), codes for most characters used in Span-
ish are in the range from 40 to 255, and codes for
most characters used in Chinese are in the range
from 11,000 and 30,000. Accordingly, we have
designed a simple procedure which computes the
average code for the sequence of characters to be
translated. This average value is compared with a
threshold to determine whether the given sequence
of characters represents a Chinese or a Spanish in-
put.

4 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999951705882353">
In this demo paper, we described “CHISPA on
the GO” a translation service that allows travelers-
in-need to have an easy and convenient access to
Chinese-Spanish translations via a mobile app.
The main characteristics of the presented sys-
tem are: the use direct translation between Chi-
nese and Spanish, the support of both website as
well as mobile platforms, and the integration of
supporting input technologies such as Automatic
Speech Recognition, Optical Character Recogni-
tion, Image retrieval and Language detection.
As future work we intend to exploit collected
data to implement an index and search engine for
providing fast access to most commonly requested
translations. The objective of this enhancement is
twofold: supporting off-line mode and alleviating
the translation server load.

When the server response is received, we parse the JSON object. Afterwards, with the HTTPConnection method and the information parsed, we send the URL back to the server and we retrieve the images requested. Also</context>

This approach performs the translation splitting the source sentence in segments and assigning to each segment a bilingual phrase from a phrasetable. Bilingual phrases are translation units that contain source words and target words, and have different scores associated to them. These bilingual phrases are then selected in order to maximize a linear combination of feature functions. Such strategy is known as the log-linear model (Och and Ney, 2002). The two main feature functions are the translation model and the target language model. Additional models include lexical weights, phrase and word penalty and reordering. 2.1 Experimental details Generally, Chinese-Spanish translation follows pivot approaches to be translated (Costa-juss`a et al., 2012) because of the lack of parallel data to train the direct approach. The main advantage of our system is that we are using the direct approach and at the same time we rely on a pretty large corpus. For Chinese-Spanish, we use (1) the Holy Bible corpus (Banchs and Li, 2008), (2) the 33 Proceedin</context>

Below, we explain the main components of the architecture, starting with the backend and ending with the front-end. 3.1.1 Back-end As previously mentioned, our translation system uses MOSES. More specifically, we use the open source MOSES server application developed by Saint-Amand (2013). Because translation tables need to be kept permanently in memory, we use binary tables to reduce the memory space consumption. The MOSES server communicates with a PHP script that is responsible for receiving the query to be translated and sending the translation back. For the Chinese-Spanish language pair, we count with four types of PHP scripts. Two of them communicate with the web-site and the other two with the mobile applications. In both cases, one Figure 1: Block diagram of the system architecture of the two PHP scripts supports Chinese to Spanish translations and the other one the Sp</context>
