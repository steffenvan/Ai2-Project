<bodyText confidence="0.952778470588235">
A set of rules, named CSDC (Conjunct Scope
Determination Constraints), is suggested for
attacking the conjunct scope problem, the major
issue in the automatic processing of conjunctions
which has been raising great difficulty for natu-
ral language Processing systems. Grammars embody-
ing the CSDC are incorporated into an existing ATN
parser, and are tested successfully against a wide
group of &amp;quot;and&amp;quot; conjunctive sentences, which are of
three types, namely clausal coordination, phrasal
coordination, and gapping. With phrasal coordina-
tion the structure with two NPs coordinated by
&amp;quot;and&amp;quot; has been given most attention.
It is hoped that an ATN parser capable of
dealing with a large variety of conjunctions in an
efficient way will finally emerge from the present
work.

<bodyText confidence="0.920792">
One of the most complicated phenomena in
English is conjunction constructions. Even quite
simple noun phrases like
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.415945">
(1) Cats with whiskers and tails
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.955180866666667">
are structurally ambiguous and would cause problem
when translated from English to, say, Chinese.
Since in Chinese all the modifiers of the noun
should go before it, two different translations in
Chinese might be got from the above phrase:
(la) (With whiskers and tails) de (cats) (&amp;quot;de&amp;quot; is
a particle which connects the modifiers and
the modifieds);
(lb) ((With whiskers) de (cats)) and (tails).
Needless to say, a machine translation system
should be able to analyse correctly among other
things the conjunction constructions before high
quality translation can be achieved.
As is well known, ATN (Augmented Transition
Network) grammars are powerful in natural language

parsing and have been widely applied in various
NL processing systems. However, the standard ATN
grammars are rather weak in dealing with con-
junctions.
In (Woods 73), a special facility SYSCONJ for
processing conjunctions was designed and imple-
mented in the LUNAR speech question-answering sys-
tem. It is capable of analysing reduced conjunc-
tions impressively (eg, &amp;quot;John drove his car
through and completely demolished a plate glass
window&amp;quot;), but it has two drawbacks: first, for the
processing of general types of conjunction con-
structions, it is too costly and too inefficient;
secondly, the method itself is highly non-deter-
ministic and easily results in combinatorial ex-
plosions.
In (Blackwell 81), a WRD AND arc was propos-
ed. The arc would take the interpreter from the
final to the initial state of a&apos;comPutation, then
analyse the second argument of a coordinated con-
struction on a second pass through the ATN net-
work. With this method she can deal with some
rather complicated conjunction constructions, but
in fact a WRD AND arc could have been added to
nearly every state of the network, thus making the
grammar extremely bulky. Furthermore, her system
lacks the power for resolving the ambiguities con-
tained in structures like (1).
In the machine translation system designed by
(Nagao et al 82), when dealing with conjunctions,
only the nearest two items of the same parts of
speech were processed, while the following types
of coordinated conjunctions were not analysed
correctly:

(Roguraev in press) suggested that a demon

should be created which would be woken up when
&amp;quot;and&amp;quot; is encountered. The demon will suspend the
normal processing, inspect the current context
(the local registers which hold constituents re-
cognised at this level) and recent history, and
use the information thus gained to construct a new
ATN arc dynamically which seeks to recognise a
constituent categorially similar to the one just
completed or being currently processed. Obviously
the demon is based on expectations, but what fol-
lows the &amp;quot;and&amp;quot; is extremely uncertain so that it
would be very difficult for the demon to reach a
high efficiency. A kind of &amp;quot;data-driven&amp;quot; alter-

native which may reduce the non-determinism is to
try to decide the scope of the left conjunct re-
trospectively by recognising first the type of
the right conjunct, rather than to predict the
latter by knowing the category of the constituent
to the left of the coordinator which is &amp;quot;just com-
pleted or being currently processed&amp;quot; -- an obscure
or even misleading specification.

I CASSEX PACKAGE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9976535">
CASSEX (Chinese Academy of Social Sciences;U-
niversity of Essex) is an ATN parser based on part
of the programs developed by Boguraev (1979) which
was designed for the automatic resolution of ling-
uistic ambiguities. Conjunctions, one major sour-
ce of linguistic ambiguities, however, were not
taken into consideration there because, as the au-
thor put it himself, &amp;quot;they were felt to be too
large a problem to be tackled along with all the
others&amp;quot; (Boguraev 79, 1.6).
A new set of grammars has been written, and a
lot of modifications has been made to the grammar
interpreter, so that conjunctions could be dealt
with within the ATN framework.

The following are the example sentences cor-
rectly parsed by the package:
Exl. The man with the telescope and the um-
brella kicked the ball.
Ex2. The man with the telescope and the um-
brella with a handle kicked the ball.
Ex3. The man with the telescope and the wo-
man kicked the ball.
Ex4. The man with the telescope and the wo-
man with the umbrella kicked the ball.
Ex5. The man with the child and the woman
kicked the ball.
Ex6. The man with the child and the woman
with the umbrella kicked the ball.
Ex7. The man with the child and the woman
is kicking the ball.
Ex8. The man with the child and the woman
are kicking the ball.
Ex9. The man with the child and the umbrella
fell.

III ELEMENTARY NP AND EXPANDED NP
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999934375">
The term &apos;elementary NP&apos; is used to indicate
a noun phrase which can be embedded in but has no
other noun phrases embedded in it. A noun phrase
which contains other, embedded, NPs is called &apos;ex-
panded Npl. Thus, when analysing the sentence
fragment &amp;quot;the man with the telescope and the woman
with the umbrella&amp;quot;, we will have four elementary
NPs (&amp;quot;the man&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;the telescope&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;the woman&amp;quot; and
&amp;quot;the umbrella&amp;quot;) and two expanded NPs (&amp;quot;the man
with the telescope&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;the woman with the umbre-
lla&amp;quot;). We may well have a third kind of NP, the
coordinated NP with conjunction in it, but it is
the result of, rather than the material for, con-
junction processing, and therefore will not recei-
ve particular attention. In the text followed we
will use &apos;EL-NP&apos; and &apos;EXP-NP&apos; to represent the two
types of noun phrases, respectively.
LEFT-PART will stand for the whole fragment
to the left of the coordinator; and RIGHT-PART for
the fragment to the right of it. LEFT-WORD and
RIGHT-WORD will indicate the word immediately pre-
cedes and follows, respectively, the coordinator.
The conjunct to the right of the coordinator will
be called RIGHT-PHRASE.

VI CSDC RULES
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999850105263158">
Constraints for determining the grammatical-
ness of constructions involving coordinating con-
junctions have been suggested by linguists, among
which are (Ross 67)&apos;s CSC (Coordinate Structure
Constraint), (Schachter 77)&apos;s CCC (Coordinate Con-
stituent Constraint), (Williams 78)&apos;s Across-the-
Board (ATB) Convention, and (Gazdar 81)&apos;snontrans-
formational treatment of coordinate structures u-
sing the conception of &apos;derived categories&apos;. These
constraints are useful in the investigation of co-
ordination phenomena,but in order to process coor-
dinating structures automatically, some constraint
defined from the procedural point of view is still
required.
The following ordered rules, named CSDC (Con-
juncts Scope Determination Constraints), are sug-
gested and embodied in the CASSEX package so as to
meet the need for automatically deciding the scope
of the conjuncts:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.899463">
1. Syntactical constraint.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.988485">
The syntactical constraint has two Darts:
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.991863">
82
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.952199684210526">
1.1 The conjuncts should be of the same syn-
tactical category;
1.2 The coordinated constituent should be in
conformity syntactically with the other constitu-
ents of the sentence, eg if the coordinated con-
stituent is the subject, it should agree with the
finite verb in terms of person and number.
Acoording to this constraint, Ex8 should be
analysed as follows (the representation is a tree
diagram with &apos;CLAUSE&apos; as the root and centred a-
round the verb, with various case nodes indicating
the dependency relationships between the verb and
the other constituents):
According to rule 2, Exl should be roughly
represented as &apos;The man with (AND (telescope) (um-
brella))&apos;; Ex2, &apos;The man with (AND (telescope)
(umbrella with a handle))&apos;; Ex3, &apos;(AND (man with
telescope) (woman))&apos; and Ex4, &apos;(AND (man with te-
lescope) (woman with umbrella))&apos;.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.854357">
3. Symmetry constraint.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9848236">
When rules 1 and 2 are not enough for deci-
ding the scope of the conjuncts, as for Ex5 and
Ex6, this rule of prel&apos;erring conjuncts with symme-
trical pre-modifiers and/or post-modifiers will be
in effect:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.57739">
Ex5. ...with (AND (child) (woman)) ...
• • •
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.8001155">
while ExT (and the more general case of Ex5) should
be analysed roughly as:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9801857">
(AGENT
((MAN ...)
(NUMBER SINGLE)
(QUANTIFIER SG)
(DETERMINER ((DET1 ONE)))
(ATTRIBUTE ((PREP (PREP W/TH))
AND
((CHILD...)
(NUMBER ...) ...)
((WOMAN ...)
</equation>
<listItem confidence="0.8790765">
• • •
2. Semantic constraint.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.954546111111111">
NPs whose head noun semantic Primitives are
the same should be preferred when deciding the sco-
pe of the two conjuncts coordinated by &amp;quot;and&amp;quot;. How-
ever, if no such NPs can be found, NPs with dif-
ferent head noun semantic primitives are coordina-
ted anyhow.
* Cf (Wilks 75).
Ex6. (AND (the man with ...) (the woman with
...))...
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.742962">
4. Closeness constraint.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.985425166666667">
If all the three rules above cannot help, the
NP to the left of &amp;quot;and&amp;quot; -which is closest to the co-
ordinator should be coordinated with the NP imme-
diately following the coordinator:
Ex9. The man with (AND (child) (umbrella))
fell.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.706317" genericHeader="method">
V THE IMPLEMENTATION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999924125">
The seemingly straightforward way for deal-
ing with conjunctions using the ATN grammars would
be to add extra WRD AND arcs to the existing sta-
tes, as (Blackwell 81) proposed. The problem with
this method is that, as (Boguraev in press) point-
ed out, &amp;quot;generally speaking, one will need WRD AND
arcs to take the ATN interpreter from just about
every state in the network back to.almosteach pre-
ceding state on the same level, thus introducing
large overheads in terms of additional arcs and
complicated tests.&amp;quot;
Instead of adding extra WRD AND arcs to the
existing states in a standard ATN grammar, I set
up a whole set of states to describe coordination
phenomena. The first few states in the set are as
follows:

The CONJ/ states can be seen as a subgrammr
which is separated from the main (conventional) ATN
grammar, and is connected with the main grammar via
the interpreter.
The parser works in the following way.
Before a conjunction is encountered, the par-
ser works normally except that two extra stacks are
set: **NP-STACK and **PREP-STACK. Each NP, either
EL-NP or EXP-NP, is pushed into **NP-STACK,together
with a label indicating whether the NP in question
is a subject (SUBJ) or an object (OBJ) or a prepo-
sition object (NP-IN-NMODS).
The interpreter takes responsibility of look-
ing ahead one word to see whether the word to come
is a conjunction. This happens when the interpret-
er is processing &amp;quot;word-consuming&amp;quot; arcs, ie CAT,
WRD, MEM and TST arcs. Hence no need for expli-
citly writing into the grammar WRD AND arcs at all.
By the time a conjunction is met, while the
interpreter is ready to enter the CONJ/ state, ei-
ther a clause (Ex10-13) or a noun phrase in subject
position (Ex1-9) would have been POPed, or a verb
(Ex14-15) would have been found. For the first ca-
se, a flag LEFT-PART-IS-CLAUSE will be set to true,
and the interpreter will try to parse RIGHT-PART as
a clause. If it succeeds, the representation of a
sentence consisted of two coordinated clauses will
be outputted. If it fails, a flag RIGHT-PART-IS-
NOT-CLAUSE is set up, and the sentence will be re-
parsed. This time the left-part will not be treat
-ed as a clause, and a coordinated NP object will
be looked for instead. Ex10 and Exll are examples
of coordinated clauses and coordinated NP object,
respectively. One case is treated specially: when
LEFT-PART-IS-CLAUSE is true and RIGHT-WORD is a
verb (Ex13), the subject will be copied from the
left clause so that a right clause could be built.
For the second case, a coordinated NP subject
will be looked for. Eg, for Ex4, by the time &amp;quot;and&amp;quot;
is met, an NP &amp;quot;the man with the telescope&amp;quot; would
have been POPed, and the state of affairs or the
**NP-STACK would be like this:
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.658119" genericHeader="method">
(((MAN ...) (NUMBER ...) (QUANTIFIER ..
TERMINER ...) (ATTRIBUTE ((PREP (PREP WITH)) ((TE-
LESCOPE ...))) SUBJ) ((TELESCOPE ...)NP-IN-NMODS))
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999898309523809">
After the excution of the arc ((PUSH NP) (NP-
START)), RIGHT-PHRASE has been found. If it has
an PP modifier, a register NMODS-CONJ will be set
to the value of the modifier. Now the NPs in the
**NP-STACK will be POPed one by one to be compared
with the right phrase semantically. The NP whose
formula head (the head of the NOUN in it) is the
same as that of the right conjunct will be taken
as the proper left conjunct. If the NP matched is
a subject or object, then a coordinative NP sub-
ject or object will be outputted; if it is an EL-
NP in a PP modifier, then a function REBUILD-SUBJ
or REBUILD-OBJ, depending on whether the modified
EXP-NP is the subject or the object, will be call-
ed to re-build the EXP-NP whose PP modifier should
consist of a preposition and two coordinated NPs.
Here one problem arises: for Ex5, the first
NP to be compared with the right Phrase (&amp;quot;the wo-
man&amp;quot;) would be &amp;quot;the man with the child&amp;quot; whose head
noun &amp;quot;man&amp;quot; would be matched to &amp;quot;woman&amp;quot; but, accor-
ding to our Symmetry Constraint, it is &amp;quot;child&amp;quot;
that should be matched. In order to implement this
rule, whenever NMODS-CONJ is empty (meaning that
the right NP has no post-modifier), the **NP-STACK
should be reversed so that the first NP to be tri-
ed would be the one nearest to the coordinator (in
this case &amp;quot;the child&amp;quot;).
For the third case (LEFT-WORD is a transitive
verb and the object slot is empty, Exs 14 and 15),
right clause will be built first, with or without
copying the subject from LEFT-PART depending on
whether a subject can be found in RIGHT-PART.Then,
the left clause will be completed by copying the
object from the right clause, and finally a clau-
sal coordination representation will be returned.
In the course of parsing, whenever a finite
verb is met, the NPs at the same level as the verb
and having been PUSHed into the **NP-STACK should
be deleted from it so that when constructing p(s-
sible coordinative NP object, the NPs in the sub-
ject position would not confuse the matching. Exll
is thus correctly analysed.

VI DISCUSSION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999978066666667">
The package is written in RUTGERS-UC/ LISP and
is implemented on the PDP-10 computer at the Uni-
versity of Essex. It performs satisfactorily. How-
ever, there is still much work to be done. For ins-
tance, the most efficient way for treating .reduced
conjunctions is to be found. Another problem is
the scope of the pre-modifiers and post-modifiers
in coordinate constructions, for the resolution of
which the Symmetry constraint may prove inadiquate
(eg, it cannot discriminate &amp;quot;American history and
literature&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;American history and physics&amp;quot;).
It is hoped that an ATN parser capable of de-
aling with a large variety of coordinated construc-
tions in an efficient way will finally emerge from
the present work.

A kind of &amp;quot;data-driven&amp;quot; alter81 native which may reduce the non-determinism is to try to decide the scope of the left conjunct retrospectively by recognising first the type of the right conjunct, rather than to predict the latter by knowing the category of the constituent to the left of the coordinator which is &amp;quot;just completed or being currently processed&amp;quot; -- an obscure or even misleading specification. I CASSEX PACKAGE CASSEX (Chinese Academy of Social Sciences;University of Essex) is an ATN parser based on part of the programs developed by Boguraev (1979) which was designed for the automatic resolution of linguistic ambiguities. Conjunctions, one major source of linguistic ambiguities, however, were not taken into consideration there because, as the author put it himself, &amp;quot;they were felt to be too large a problem to be tackled along with all the others&amp;quot; (Boguraev 79, 1.6). A new set of grammars has been written, and a lot of modifications has been made to the grammar interpreter, so that conjunctions could be dealt with within the ATN framework.
