nominals seem to be quite rare. This is probably because
of a principle that says noun modifiers should further
restrict the possible reference of the noun phrase, and
parts are common to too many wholes to perform that
function.

(3) A knowledge base contains two kinds of know-
ledge, &amp;quot;type&amp;quot; knowledge about what kinds of situations
are possible, and &amp;quot;token&amp;quot; knowledge about what the
actual situation is. We are trying to determine which of
these kinds of knowledge are required for each of the
pragmatics problems. For example, reference requires
both type and token knowledge, whereas most if not all
instances of metonymy seem to require only type know-
ledge.
(4) At the most abstract level, interpretation requires
the constructive proof of a single logical expression
consisting of many conjuncts. The deduction component

<bodyText confidence="0.928394">
can attempt to prove these conjuncts in a variety of
orders. We have been investigating some of these possi-
ble orders. For example, one plausible candidate is that
one should work from the inside out, trying first to solve
the reference problems of arguments of predications
before attempting to solve the compound nominal and
metonymy problems presented by those predications. In
our framework, this is an issue of where subgoals for the
deduction component should be placed on an agenda.

IMPLEMENTATION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999972466666667">
In our implementation of the TACITUS system, we are
beginning with the minimal approach and building up
slowly. As we implement the local pragmatics oper-
ations, we are using a knowledge base containing only
the axioms that are needed for the test examples. Thus,
it grows slowly as we try out more and more texts. As
we gain greater confidence in the pragmatics operations,
we will move more and more of the axioms from our
commonsense and domain knowledge bases into the
system&apos;s knowledge base. Our initial versions of the
pragmatics operations are, for the most part, fairly stand-
ard techniques recast into our abstract framework. When
the knowledge base has reached a significant size, we will
begin experimenting with more general solutions and
with various constraints on those general solutions.

FUTURE PLANS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999491">
In addition to pursuing our research in each of the areas
described above, we will institute two new efforts next
year. First of all, we will begin to extend our work in
pragmatics to the recognition of discourse structure. This
problem is illustrated by the following text:
Air regulating valve failed.
Gas turbine engine wouldn&apos;t turn over.
Valve parts corroded.
The temporal structure of this text is 3-1-2; first the
valve parts corroded, and this caused the valve to fail,
which caused the engine to not turn over. To recognize
this structure, one must reason about causal relationships
in the model of the device, and in addition one must
recognize patterns of explanation and consequence in the
text.
The second new effort will be to build tools for
domain knowledge acquisition. These will be based on
the abstract machines in terms of which we are presently
encoding our domain knowledge. Thus, the system
should be able to allow the user to choose one of a set of
abstract machines and then to augment it with various
parts, properties and relations.

22-24 October 1986, Georgia Institute of Technology,
Atlanta, Georgia
The purpose of the meeting is to explore subjects and
methods of scientific inquiry of common interest to infor-
mation and software science, and to identify directions of
research that will benefit from the mutual interaction of
the two fields. The main theme of this symposium is
empirical methods of evaluation of man-machine interfaces.
Specific examples of relevant focal topics are: friendli-
ness, portability, sensitivity, fidelity, integrity, fault-toler-
ance, compatibility, modularity, and evolution of
man-machine interfaces; efficiency of interfaces as
communication channels; evaluation of effects of error
propagation through interfaces; modeling man-machine
interfaces.
Contributed papers will be considered also on other
aspects of empiric foundations of information and soft-
ware sciences such as methods of experimental design;
measurement theory and techniques; empirical laws and
theories of information and software sciences; their vali-
dation and verification; experimental data bases; and
software properties and their evaluation and measure-
ment.
All submitted papers will be refereed. Those selected
will be scheduled for presentation and published in the
proceedings of the symposium.
Abstracts of papers (at least 150 words long) are due
by 15 March 1986. Authors will be notified of their

IJCAI-87
TENTH INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE
ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993007954545454">
23-28 August, 1987, Milan, Italy
The IJCAI conferences are the main forums for the pres-
entation of artificial intelligence research to an interna-
tional audience. The goal of IJCAI-87 is to promote
scientific interchange, within and between all subfields of
Al, among researchers from all over the world. The
conference is sponsored by the International Joint
Conferences on Artificial Intelligence, Inc. (IJCAII).
In response to the growing interest in engineering
issues within the Al community, IJCAI-87&apos;s Technical
Program will have two distinct tracks: science and engi-
neering. The science papers, presented Sunday through
Wednesday (23-26 August), will stress the computational
principles underlying cognition and perception in man
and machine. The engineering papers, presented Tuesday
through Friday (25-28 August), will highlight pragmatic
issues that arise in applying these computational princi-
ples. Tutorials will be presented on Sunday and Monday
in parallel with the first two days of the science paper
presentations. Meetings or workshops focussed on
specific research issues might most appropriately be held
on Thursday or Friday.

This book, to be published in February 1987, will be
the official book for the first major international exhibi-
tion on Artificial Intelligence, The Age of Intelligent
Machines (AIM). The AIM exhibition is sponsored by
nine leading science museums in the United States and
anticipates over four million visitors during its three-year
national tour. A wide range of Fortune 500 companies,
emerging AI companies, and leading academic insti-
tutions are providing exhibits and support.
The Age of Intelligent Machines will be published
simultaneously in three languages — English (The MIT
Press), French (Editions Hologramme), and Japanese. It
will be an attractive volume of approximately 300 pages
with over 300 illustrations, including color photographs,
computer graphics, and original artwork by leading
artists. There will be a companion videotape with
contributions from a number of talented film makers.
The author, Raymond Kurzweil, is a leading authority
on Artificial Intelligence and Chairman of the AIM exhi-
bition. Proceeds from the sale of the book will go the
The MIT Press and the Kurzweil Foundation, both
nonprofit organizations. The Kurzweil Foundation

CALL FOR NOMINATIONS FOR IJCAI AWARDS
THE IJCAI AWARD FOR RESEARCH EXCELLENCE
</note>
<bodyText confidence="0.99949305">
The IJCAI Award for Research Excellence is given, at
each International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelli-
gence, to a scientist who has carried out a program of
research of consistently high quality yielding several
substantial results. If the research program has been
carried out collaboratively the award may be made jointly
to the research team. The first recipient of this award
was John McCarthy in 1985.
The Award carries with it a certificate and the sum of
$1,000 plus travel and living expenses for the IJCAI. The
researcher(s) will be invited to deliver an address on the
nature and significance of the results achieved and write
a paper for the conference proceedings. Primarily,
however, the award carries the honour of having one&apos;s
work selected by one&apos;s peers as an exemplar of sustained
research in the maturing science of Artificial Intelligence.
We hereby call for nominations for The IJCAI Award
for Research Excellence to be made at IJCAI-87 in Milan.
The note on Selection Procedures for IJCAI Awards
provides the relevant details.

ANNOUNCEMENTS
THE CATALOGUE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TOOLS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999733714285714">
The Catalogue of Artificial Intelligence Tools is a kind of
mail order catalogue of Al techniques and portable soft-
*are. Its purpose is to promote interaction between
members of the Al community. It does this by announc-
ing the existence of Al tools, and acting as a pointer into
the literature. Thus the Al community will have access to
a common, extensional definition of the field, which will:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.997176">
• promote a common terminology,
• discourage the reinvention of wheels, and
• act as a clearing house for ideas and software.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999680318181818">
The catalogue is a reference work providing a quick
guide to the Al tools available for different jobs. It is not
intended to be a textbook like the Artificial Intelligence
Handbook. It, intentionally, only provides a brief
description of each tool, with no extended discussion of
the historical origin of the tool or how it has been used in
particular AI programs. The focus is on techniques
abstracted from their historical origins.
The original version of the catalogue was hastily built
in 1983 as part of the UK SERC-DoI, IKBS, Architec-
ture Study. It has now been adopted by the UK Alvey
Programme and is both kept as an on-line document
undergoing constant revision and refinement and
published as a paperback by Springer Verlag. Springer
Verlag have agreed to reprint the Catalogue at frequent
intervals in order to keep it up to date.
The on-line and paperback versions of the catalogue
meet different needs and differ in the entries they
contain. In particular, the on-line version was designed
to promote UK interaction and contains all the entries we
received that meet the criteria defined below. Details of
how to access the on-line version are available from

<abstract confidence="0.999143815384615">nominals seem to be quite rare. This is probably because of a principle that says noun modifiers should further restrict the possible reference of the noun phrase, and parts are common to too many wholes to perform that function. (3) A knowledge base contains two kinds of knowledge, &amp;quot;type&amp;quot; knowledge about what kinds of situations are possible, and &amp;quot;token&amp;quot; knowledge about what the actual situation is. We are trying to determine which of these kinds of knowledge are required for each of the pragmatics problems. For example, reference requires both type and token knowledge, whereas most if not all instances of metonymy seem to require only type knowledge. (4) At the most abstract level, interpretation requires the constructive proof of a single logical expression consisting of many conjuncts. The deduction component can attempt to prove these conjuncts in a variety of orders. We have been investigating some of these possible orders. For example, one plausible candidate is that one should work from the inside out, trying first to solve the reference problems of arguments of predications before attempting to solve the compound nominal and metonymy problems presented by those predications. In our framework, this is an issue of where subgoals for the deduction component should be placed on an agenda. IMPLEMENTATION In our implementation of the TACITUS system, we are beginning with the minimal approach and building up slowly. As we implement the local pragmatics operations, we are using a knowledge base containing only the axioms that are needed for the test examples. Thus, it grows slowly as we try out more and more texts. As we gain greater confidence in the pragmatics operations, we will move more and more of the axioms from our commonsense and domain knowledge bases into the system&apos;s knowledge base. Our initial versions of the pragmatics operations are, for the most part, fairly standard techniques recast into our abstract framework. When the knowledge base has reached a significant size, we will begin experimenting with more general solutions and with various constraints on those general solutions. FUTURE PLANS In addition to pursuing our research in each of the areas described above, we will institute two new efforts next year. First of all, we will begin to extend our work in pragmatics to the recognition of discourse structure. This problem is illustrated by the following text: Air regulating valve failed. Gas turbine engine wouldn&apos;t turn over. Valve parts corroded. The temporal structure of this text is 3-1-2; first the valve parts corroded, and this caused the valve to fail, which caused the engine to not turn over. To recognize this structure, one must reason about causal relationships in the model of the device, and in addition one must recognize patterns of explanation and consequence in the text. The second new effort will be to build tools for domain knowledge acquisition. These will be based on the abstract machines in terms of which we are presently encoding our domain knowledge. Thus, the system should be able to allow the user to choose one of a set of abstract machines and then to augment it with various parts, properties and relations.</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.899427684210526">The IJCAI conferences are the main forums for the presentation of artificial intelligence research to an international audience. The goal of IJCAI-87 is to promote scientific interchange, within and between all subfields of Al, among researchers from all over the world. The conference is sponsored by the International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence, Inc. (IJCAII). In response to the growing interest in engineering issues within the Al community, IJCAI-87&apos;s Technical Program will have two distinct tracks: science and engineering. The science papers, presented Sunday through Wednesday (23-26 August), will stress the computational principles underlying cognition and perception in man and machine. The engineering papers, presented Tuesday through Friday (25-28 August), will highlight pragmatic issues that arise in applying these computational principles. Tutorials will be presented on Sunday and Monday in parallel with the first two days of the science paper presentations. Meetings or workshops focussed on specific research issues might most appropriately be held on Thursday or Friday. TOPICS OF INTEREST Authors are invited to submit papers to either the science or engineering tracks within one of the following topic areas: Linguistics, Volume 12, Number 3, July-September 1986 The FINITE STRING Newsletter Calls for Papers, Proposals, Pictures, Nominations — Architectures and Languages (including logic programming, user interface technology) — Reasoning (including theorem proving, planning, explaining) / — Knowledge Acquisition and Learning (including knowledge-base maintenance) — Knowledge Representation (including task domain analysis) — Cognitive Modeling — Natural Language Understanding — Perception and Signal Understanding (including speech, vision, data interpretation) — Robotics REQUIREMENTS FOR SUBMISSION Authors are requested to prepare full papers, no more than 7 proceedings&apos; pages (approximately 5600 words), or short papers, no more than 3 proceedings&apos; pages (approximately 2400 words). The full-paper classification is intended for well-developed ideas, with significant demonstration of validity, while the short-paper classification is intended for descriptions of research in progress. Authors must ensure that their papers describe original contributions to or novel applications of Al, regardless of length classification, and that the research is properly compared and contrasted with relevant literature. DETAILS OF SUBMISSION Authors should submit six (6) copies of their papers (hard copy only — we cannot accept on-line files) to the Chair later than Monday, 5 January 1987. following information must be included on the title page: — Author&apos;s name, address, telephone number, and computer mail address (if applicable) — Paper type (full-paper or short-paper), topic area, track (science or engineering), and a few keywords for further classification within the topic area — An abstract of 100-200 words The timetable is as follows: — Submission deadline: 5 January 1987 (papers received after 5 January will be returned unopened) Notification acceptance or rejection: March 1987 — Camera ready copy due: 10 April 1987 The language of the conference is English; all papers submitted should be written in English. REVIEW CRITERIA Each paper will be reviewed by at least two experts. Acceptance will be based on the overall merit and significance of the reported research, as well as on the quality of the presentation. A paper may be reviewed by experts responsible for an area or track other than the one to which it was submitted if, in the opinion of a program committee member, it can thereby be more fairly reviewed. Computational Linguistics, Volume 12, Number 3, July-September 1986 Papers submitted to the science track should make an original and significant contribution to knowledge in the field of artificial intelligence. Papers submitted to the engineering track should focus on pragmatic issues that arise in reducing Al principles and techniques to practice. Such papers could identify the critical features of some successful application system&apos;s approach to reasoning or knowledge acquisition or natural language understanding. Of particular interest are papers that demonstrate insightful analysis of a task domain motivating the selection of a computational and representational approach.</abstract>

<title confidence="0.78725625">CALL FOR ARTICLES AND PICTURES The MIT Press calls for articles and pictures for a major new book on artificial intelligence: The Age of Intelligent Machines</title>
<author confidence="0.918957">by Raymond Kurzweil</author>
<abstract confidence="0.982232431034483">This book, to be published in February 1987, will be the official book for the first major international exhibition on Artificial Intelligence, The Age of Intelligent Machines (AIM). The AIM exhibition is sponsored by nine leading science museums in the United States and anticipates over four million visitors during its three-year national tour. A wide range of Fortune 500 companies, emerging AI companies, and leading academic institutions are providing exhibits and support. Age of Intelligent Machines be published simultaneously in three languages — English (The MIT Press), French (Editions Hologramme), and Japanese. It will be an attractive volume of approximately 300 pages with over 300 illustrations, including color photographs, computer graphics, and original artwork by leading artists. There will be a companion videotape with contributions from a number of talented film makers. The author, Raymond Kurzweil, is a leading authority on Artificial Intelligence and Chairman of the AIM exhibition. Proceeds from the sale of the book will go the The MIT Press and the Kurzweil Foundation, both nonprofit organizations. The Kurzweil supports application of technology for the benefit of the handicapped. CALL FOR ARTICLES Seventy-five percent of the text will be written by Raymond Kurzweil. The rest will consist of approximately twenty contributed articles, most of which will be selected in the competition described here. Articles submitted may be on any aspect of AI past, present, or future, including techniques, approaches, social and economic impact, philosophical implications, future scenarios and predictions, and related topics. Articles must be alive and entertaining and should be focused on a single aspect of the subject. Human interest, anecdotes, and individual perspectives are encouraged. Keep in mind the target audience: the lay public with an interest in science as well as computer professionals. Length of the article should be in the range of 500 to 2,000 words with no more than three illustrations. Submissions must include permission to publish in the AIM book. Pictures may be included with the article and must include captions, credits, and permission to publish. Authors should send with their articles current title and affiliations and a brief biography. There will be a payment of $500 for each article selected. Deadline for submission is August 15, 1986. CALL FOR PICTURES Age of Intelligent Machines include over 300 color pictures. We invite submission of photographs on any aspect of Artificial Intelligence (color preferred, although black and white is acceptable), both current and historical, artwork, and computer graphics. Pictures will be selected on the basis of their relevance and interest level. A copy of the book will be given to those people whose pictures are accepted. Illustrations submitted must include complete captions, credits, and permission for use. Deadline for submission</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.937201333333333">The IJCAI Award for Research Excellence is given, at each International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, to a scientist who has carried out a program of research of consistently high quality yielding several substantial results. If the research program has been carried out collaboratively the award may be made jointly to the research team. The first recipient of this award was John McCarthy in 1985. The Award carries with it a certificate and the sum of $1,000 plus travel and living expenses for the IJCAI. The researcher(s) will be invited to deliver an address on the nature and significance of the results achieved and write a paper for the conference proceedings. Primarily, however, the award carries the honour of having one&apos;s work selected by one&apos;s peers as an exemplar of sustained research in the maturing science of Artificial Intelligence. We hereby call for nominations for The IJCAI Award for Research Excellence to be made at IJCAI-87 in Milan. The note on Selection Procedures for IJCAI Awards provides the relevant details. THE COMPUTERS AND THOUGHT AWARD The Computers and Thought Lecture is given at each International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence by an outstanding young scientist in the field of artificial intelligence. The Award carries with it a certificate and the sum of $1,000 plus travel and subsistence expenses for the IJCAI. The Lecture is one evening during the Conference, and the public is invited to attend. The Lecturer is invited to publish the Lecture in the conference proceedings. The Lectureship was established with received from the book and Thought, edited by Feigenbaum and Feldman; it is currently supported by income from IJCAI funds.</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.966256055555555">ArpaNet: bundy@rutgers.arpa JANet: bundy@uk.ac.edinburgh ANNOUNCEMENTS THE CATALOGUE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TOOLS Catalogue of Artificial Intelligence Tools a kind of mail order catalogue of Al techniques and portable soft- *are. Its purpose is to promote interaction between members of the Al community. It does this by announcing the existence of Al tools, and acting as a pointer into the literature. Thus the Al community will have access to a common, extensional definition of the field, which will: • promote a common terminology, • discourage the reinvention of wheels, and • act as a clearing house for ideas and software. The catalogue is a reference work providing a quick guide to the Al tools available for different jobs. It is not to be a textbook like the Intelligence intentionally, only provides a description of each tool, with no extended discussion of the historical origin of the tool or how it has been used in particular AI programs. The focus is on techniques abstracted from their historical origins. The original version of the catalogue was hastily built in 1983 as part of the UK SERC-DoI, IKBS, Architecture Study. It has now been adopted by the UK Alvey Programme and is both kept as an on-line document undergoing constant revision and refinement and published as a paperback by Springer Verlag. Springer Verlag have agreed to reprint the Catalogue at frequent intervals in order to keep it up to date. The on-line and paperback versions of the catalogue meet different needs and differ in the entries they contain. In particular, the on-line version was designed to promote UK interaction and contains all the entries we received that meet the criteria defined below. Details of how to access the on-line version are available from</abstract>
