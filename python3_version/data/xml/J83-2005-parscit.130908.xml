[Editor&apos;s note: Although it was originally intended that
this Directory should appear as part of an issue of the
Journal, it was ultimately decided that, because of its
size and potential broad circulation, it would fare bet-
ter as a special supplement, an issue in its own right.

Excerpts from the Directory&apos;s &apos;Preamble&apos; follow.]
This directory is designed to help people interested in
careers in computational linguistics locate schools with
appropriate programs. The field of computational
linguistics can be thought of as including almost every
way that natural language can combine with computers
and computational concepts. For a long time, compu-
tational linguists have worked in academic institutions
and research laboratories. More recently, they have
begun to appear in business and industrial settings.
Career possibilities are expanding as the number of
people that need to communicate with computers in-
creases. There has been a tremendous growth in the
area of human-computer interfaces, particularly in the
design of natural language front ends for data bases
and other software systems, which require research in
grammars, parsing, and semantics. Many people, par-
ticularly those who cannot type, would prefer to talk
to computers if they could. In addition, spoken input
can be essential when one&apos;s hands are occupied with
other activities. As a result careers are opening in
speech analysis and synthesis, acoustic phonetics, the
engineering of voice response systems, and the devel-
opment of aids for the handicapped. The new interest
in office automation has led a number of computer
manufacturers to hire computational linguists to work
on spelling checkers and other aids to writers, as well
as on the automatic generation, recognition, and filing
of business letters. (We recently received a request
for help in identifying someone to work on a spelling
checker for Hebrew.) The field of machine translation
is showing signs of reviving, with special emphasis on
machine-aided translation systems. There are a num-
ber of academic positions in Computer Science De-
partments for people with Ph.D. degrees and there is
reason to hope that a few may open up in Linguistics
Departments.
If you look through this directory, you will find it
includes courses in many fields: cognitive science,
computer science, linguistics, mathematics, philosophy,
and psychology, to name only a few. Computational
linguistics is an interdisciplinary field. As a result
students may be able (indeed may be required) to
design their programs around their own special inter-
ests.
The main section of the directory is organized in
alphabetical order by country. Entries within the
United States are arranged in alphabetical order by the
state in which they are located. Institutions in Canada
are in alphabetical order by the province instead.
Each entry begins with the name and address of the
university. Next come the departments with programs
in computational linguistics, the degrees offered, and
the faculty members who work in computational lin-
guistics, along with their special fields of interest.
Then comes a list of the relevant courses and also a
brief list of computer facilities, where this information
was available. Following the main directory is an al-
phabetized index of universities and places. If you are
having trouble finding a university in the directory
because you are not sure where it is, then look in this
index.
Because our field is changing so rapidly, this direc-
tory will certainly be out of date as soon as it is print-
ed. New programs are springing up; facilities are im-
proving; faculty members keep moving from place to
place. The Association for Computational Linguistics
is fortunate enough to have members all over the
world and we want to make this directory truly inter-
national. We welcome additions or corrections from
everywhere. Please send any information of this kind
to
