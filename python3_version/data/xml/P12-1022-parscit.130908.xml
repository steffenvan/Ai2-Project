Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.9989362">
The integration of multiword expressions in a
parsing procedure has been shown to improve
accuracy in an artificial context where such
expressions have been perfectly pre-identified.
This paper evaluates two empirical strategies
to integrate multiword units in a real con-
stituency parsing context and shows that the
results are not as promising as has sometimes
been suggested. Firstly, we show that pre-
grouping multiword expressions before pars-
ing with a state-of-the-art recognizer improves
multiword recognition accuracy and unlabeled
attachment score. However, it has no statis-
tically significant impact in terms of F-score
as incorrect multiword expression recognition
has important side effects on parsing. Sec-
ondly, integrating multiword expressions in
the parser grammar followed by a reranker
specific to such expressions slightly improves
all evaluation metrics.

<bodyText confidence="0.999941962962963">
The integration of Multiword Expressions (MWE)
in real-life applications is crucial because such ex-
pressions have the particularity of having a certain
level of idiomaticity. They form complex lexical
units which, if they are considered, should signifi-
cantly help parsing.
From a theoretical point of view, the integra-
tion of multiword expressions in the parsing pro-
cedure has been studied for different formalisms:
Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (Copestake
et al., 2002), Tree Adjoining Grammars (Schuler
and Joshi, 2011), etc. From an empirical point of
view, their incorporation has also been considered
such as in (Nivre and Nilsson, 2004) for depen-
dency parsing and in (Arun and Keller, 2005) in con-
stituency parsing. Although experiments always re-
lied on a corpus where the MWEs were perfectly
pre-identified, they showed that pre-grouping such
expressions could significantly improve parsing ac-
curacy. Recently, Green et al. (2011) proposed in-
tegrating the multiword expressions directly in the
grammar without pre-recognizing them. The gram-
mar was trained with a reference treebank where
MWEs were annotated with a specific non-terminal
node.
Our proposal is to evaluate two discriminative
strategies in a real constituency parsing context:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.72165352631579">
(a) pre-grouping MWE before parsing; this would
be done with a state-of-the-art recognizer based
on Conditional Random Fields; (b) parsing with
a grammar including MWE identification and then
reranking the output parses thanks to a Maxi-
mum Entropy model integrating MWE-dedicated
features. (a) is the direct realistic implementation of
the standard approach that was shown to reach the
best results (Arun and Keller, 2005). We will evalu-
ate if real MWE recognition (MWER) still positively
impacts parsing, i.e., whether incorrect MWER does
not negatively impact the overall parsing system.
(b) is a more innovative approach to MWER (de-
spite not being new in parsing): we select the final
MWE segmentation after parsing in order to explore
as many parses as possible (as opposed to method
(a)). The experiments were carried out on the French
Treebank (Abeill´e et al., 2003) where MWEs are an-
notated.

2.1 Overview
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999693352941177">
Multiword expressions are lexical items made up
of multiple lexemes that undergo idiosyncratic con-
straints and therefore offer a certain degree of id-
iomaticity. They cover a wide range of linguistic
phenomena: fixed and semi-fixed expressions, light
verb constructions, phrasal verbs, named entities,
etc. They may be contiguous (e.g. traffic light) or
discontinuous (e.g. John took your argument into
account). They are often divided into two main
classes: multiword expressions defined through lin-
guistic idiomaticity criteria (lexicalized phrases in
the terminology of Sag et al. (2002)) and those de-
fined by statistical ones (i.e. simple collocations).
Most linguistic criteria used to determine whether a
combination of words is a MWE are based on syn-
tactic and semantic tests such as the ones described
in (Gross, 1986). For instance, the utterance at night
is a MWE because it does display a strict lexical
restriction (*at day, *at afternoon) and it does not
accept any inserting material (*at cold night, *at
present night). Such linguistically defined expres-
sions may overlap with collocations which are the
combinations of two or more words that cooccur
more often than by chance. Collocations are usu-
ally identified through statistical association mea-
sures. A detailed description of MWEs can be found
in (Baldwin and Nam, 2010).
In this paper, we focus on contiguous MWEs that
form a lexical unit which can be marked by a part-of-
speech tag (e.g. at night is an adverb, because of is a
preposition). They can undergo limited morphologi-
cal and lexical variations – e.g. traffic (light+lights),
(apple+orange+...) juice – and usually do not al-
low syntactic variations1 such as inserts (e.g. *at

cold night). Such expressions can be analyzed at the
lexical level. In what follows, we use the term com-
pounds to denote such expressions.

2.2 Identification

<bodyText confidence="0.988813761904762">
The idiomaticity property of MWEs makes them
both crucial for Natural Language Processing appli-
cations and difficult to predict. Their actual iden-
tification in texts is therefore fundamental. There
are different ways for achieving this objective. The
simpler approach is lexicon-driven and consists in
looking the MWEs up in an existing lexicon, such
as in (Silberztein, 2000). The main drawback is
that this procedure entirely relies on a lexicon and
is unable to discover unknown MWEs. The use
of collocation statistics is therefore useful. For in-
stance, for each candidate in the text, Watrin and
Franc¸ois (2011) compute on the fly its association
score from an external ngram base learnt from a
large raw corpus, and tag it as MWE if the associa-
tion score is greater than a threshold. They reach ex-
cellent scores in the framework of a keyword extrac-
tion task. Within a validation framework (i.e. with
the use of a reference corpus annotated in MWEs),
Ramisch et al. (2010) developped a Support Vector
Machine classifier integrating features correspond-
ing to different collocation association measures.
The results were rather low on the Genia corpus
and Green et al. (2011) confirmed these bad results
on the French Treebank. This can be explained by
the fact that such a method does not make any dis-
tinctions between the different types of MWEs and
the reference corpora are usually limited to certain
types of MWEs. Furthermore, the lexicon-driven
and collocation-driven approaches do not take the
context into account, and therefore cannot discard
some of the incorrect candidates. A recent trend is
to couple MWE recognition with a linguistic ana-
lyzer: a POS tagger (Constant and Sigogne, 2011)
or a parser (Green et al., 2011). Constant and Si-
gogne (2011) trained a unified Conditional Random
Fields model integrating different standard tagging
features and features based on external lexical re-
sources. They show a general tagging accuracy of
94% on the French Treebank. In terms of Multi-
word expression recognition, the accuracy was not
term.

clearly evaluated, but seemed to reach around 70-
80% F-score. Green et al. (2011) proposed to in-
clude the MWER in the grammar of the parser. To
do so, the MWEs in the training treebank were anno-
tated with specific non-terminal nodes. They used a
Tree Substitution Grammar instead of a Probabilis-
tic Context-free Grammar (PCFG) with latent anno-
tations in order to capture lexicalized rules as well
as general rules. They showed that this formalism
was more relevant to MWER than PCFG (71% F-
score vs. 69.5%). Both methods have the advantage
of being able to discover new MWEs on the basis
of lexical and syntactic contexts. In this paper, we
will take advantage of the methods described in this
section by integrating them as features of a MWER
model.

3 Two strategies, two discriminative
models
</sectionHeader>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99996">
3.1 Pre-grouping Multiword Expressions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9972789375">
MWER can be seen as a sequence labelling task
(like chunking) by using an IOB-like annotation
scheme (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995). This implies
a theoretical limitation: recognized MWEs must be
contiguous. The proposed annotation scheme is
therefore theoretically weaker than the one proposed
by Green et al. (2011) that integrates the MWER in
the grammar and allows for discontinuous MWEs.
Nevertheless, in practice, the compounds we are
dealing with are very rarely discontinuous and if so,
they solely contain a single word insert that can be
easily integrated in the MWE sequence. Constant
and Sigogne (2011) proposed to combine MWE seg-
mentation and part-of-speech tagging into a single
sequence labelling task by assigning to each token a
tag of the form TAG+X where TAG is the part-of-
speech (POS) of the lexical unit the token belongs to
and X is either B (i.e. the token is at the beginning
of the lexical unit) or I (i.e. for the remaining posi-
tions): John/N+B hates/V+B traffic/N+B jams/N+I.
In this paper, as our task consists in jointly locating
and tagging MWEs, we limited the POS tagging to
MWEs only (TAG+B/TAG+I), simple words being
tagged by O (outside): John/O hates/O traffic/N+B
jams/N+I.
For such a task, we used Linear chain Conditional
Ramdom Fields (CRF) that are discriminative prob-
abilistic models introduced by Lafferty et al. (2001)
for sequential labelling. Given an input sequence of
tokens x = (x1, x2, ..., xN) and an output sequence
of labels y = (y1, y2,..., yN), the model is defined
as follows:
where Z(x) is a normalization factor depending
on x. It is based on K features each of them be-
ing defined by a binary function fk depending on
the current position t in x, the current label yt, the
preceding one yt−1 and the whole input sequence
x. The tokens xi of x integrate the lexical value
of this token but can also integrate basic properties
which are computable from this value (for example:
whether it begins with an upper case, it contains a
number, its tags in an external lexicon, etc.). The
feature is activated if a given configuration between
t, yt, yt−1 and x is satisfied (i.e. fk(t, yt, yt−1, x) =
1). Each feature fk is associated with a weight λk.
The weights are the parameters of the model, to be
estimated. The features used for MWER will be de-
scribed in section 5.

3.2 Reranking
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9982218">
Discriminative reranking consists in reranking the n-
best parses of a baseline parser with a discriminative
model, hence integrating features associated with
each node of the candidate parses. Charniak and
Johnson (2005) introduced different features that
showed significant improvement in general parsing
accuracy (e.g. around +1 point in English). For-
mally, given a sentence s, the reranker selects the
best candidate parse p among a set of candidates
P(s) with respect to a scoring function Vθ:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.984096">
p* = argmaxpEP(s)Vθ(p)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.99994725">
The set of candidates P(s) corresponds to the n-best
parses generated by the baseline parser. The scor-
ing function Vθ is the scalar product of a parameter
vector θ and a feature vector f:

Vθ(p) = θ.f(p) = E θj.fj(p)

where fj(p) corresponds to the number of occur-
rences of the feature fj in the parse p. According to

Charniak and Johnson (2005), the first feature fl is
the probability of p provided by the baseline parser.
The vector 0 is estimated during the training stage
from a reference treebank and the baseline parser
ouputs.
In this paper, we slightly deviate from the original
reranker usage, by focusing on improving MWER
in the context of parsing. Given the n-best parses,
we want to select the one with the best MWE seg-
mentation by keeping the overall parsing accuracy as
high as possible. We therefore used MWE-dedicated
features that we describe in section 5. The training
stage was performed by using a Maximum entropy
algorithm as in (Charniak and Johnson, 2005).

The French Treebank2 [FTB] (Abeill´e et al., 2003)
is a syntactically annotated corpus made up of jour-
nalistic articles from Le Monde newspaper. We
used the latest edition of the corpus (June 2010)
that we preprocessed with the Stanford Parser pre-
processing tools (Green et al., 2011). It contains
473,904 tokens and 15,917 sentences. One benefit of
this corpus is that its compounds are marked. Their
annotation was driven by linguistic criteria such as
the ones in (Gross, 1986). Compounds are identified
with a specific non-terminal symbol ”MWX” where
X is the part-of-speech of the expression. They have
a flat structure made of the part-of-speech of their
components as shown in figure 1.

The French Treebank is composed of 435,860 lex-

compounds (20.8% for types). In addition, 12.9%

of the tokens belong to a MWE, which, on average,
has 2.7 tokens. The non-terminal tagset is composed
of 14 part-of-speech labels and 24 phrasal ones (in-
cluding 11 MWE labels). The train/dev/test split is
the same as in (Green et al., 2011): 1,235 sentences
for test, 1,235 for development and 13,347 for train-
ing. The development and test sections are the same
as those generally used for experiments in French,
e.g. (Candito and Crabb´e, 2009).

4.2 Lexical resources
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999990382352941">
French is a resource-rich language as attested by
the existing morphological dictionaries which in-
clude compounds. In this paper, we use two large-
coverage general-purpose dictionaries: Dela (Cour-
tois, 1990; Courtois et al., 1997) and Lefff (Sagot,
2010). The Dela was manually developed in the
90’s by a team of linguists. We used the distribution
freely available in the platform Unitex3 (Paumier,
2011). It is composed of 840,813 lexical entries in-
cluding 104,350 multiword ones (91,030 multiword
nouns). The compounds present in the resources re-
spect the linguistic criteria defined in (Gross, 1986).
The lefff is a freely available dictionary4 that has
been automatically compiled by drawing from dif-
ferent sources and that has been manually validated.
We used a version with 553,138 lexical entries in-
cluding 26,311 multiword ones (22,673 multiword
nouns). Their different modes of acquisition makes
those two resources complementary. In both, lexical
entries are composed of a inflected form, a lemma,
a part-of-speech and morphological features. The
Dela has an additional feature for most of the mul-
tiword entries: their syntactic surface form. For in-
stance, eau de vie (brandy) has the feature NDN be-
cause it has the internal flat structure noun – prepo-
sition de – noun.
In order to compare compounds in these lexical
resources with the ones in the French Treebank, we
applied on the development corpus the dictionar-
ies and the lexicon extracted from the training cor-
pus. By a simple look-up, we obtained a prelimi-
nary lexicon-based MWE segmentation. The results
are provided in table 1. They show that the use of
external resources may improve recall, but they lead

5 MWE-dedicated Features
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999731166666667">
The two discriminative models described in sec-
tion 3 require MWE-dedicated features. In order to
make these models comparable, we use two compa-
rable sets of feature templates: one adapted to se-
quence labelling (CRF-based MWER) and the other
one adapted to reranking (MaxEnt-based reranker).
The MWER templates are instantiated at each posi-
tion of the input sequence. The reranker templates
are instantiated only for the nodes of the candidate
parse tree, which are leaves dominated by a MWE
node (i.e. the node has a MWE ancestor). We define
a template T as follows:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.997949666666667">
• MWER: for each position n in the input se-
quence x,
T = f(x, n)/yn
• RERANKER: for each leaf (in position n)

</listItem>
<equation confidence="0.960238">
T = f(p, n)/label(m)/pos(p, n)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9996936">
where f is a function to be defined; yn is the out-
put label at position n; label(m) is the label of node
m and pos(p, n) indicates the position of the word
corresponding to n in the MWE sequence: B (start-
ing position), I (remaining positions).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.968791">
5.1 Endogenous Features
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999905551724138">
Endogenous features are features directly extracted
from properties of the words themselves or from a
tool learnt from the training corpus (e.g. a tagger).
Word n-grams. We use word unigrams and bigrams
in order to capture multiwords present in the training
section and to extract lexical cues to discover new
MWEs. For instance, the bigram coup de is often
the prefix of compounds such as coup de pied (kick),
coup de foudre (love at first sight), coup de main
(help).
POS n-grams. We use part-of-speech unigrams
and bigrams in order to capture MWEs with irreg-
ular syntactic structures that might indicate the id-
iomacity of a word sequence. For instance, the POS
sequence preposition – adverb associated with the
compound depuis peu (recently) is very unusual in
French. We also integrated mixed bigrams made up
of a word and a part-of-speech.
Specific features. Due to their different use, each
model integrates some specific features. In order to
deal with unknown words and special tokens, we in-
corporate standard tagging features in the CRF: low-
ercase forms of the words, word prefixes of length 1
to 4, word suffice of length 1 to 4, whether the word
is capitalized, whether the token has a digit, whether
it is an hyphen. We also add label bigrams. The
reranker models integrate features associated with
each MWE node, the value of which is the com-
pound itself.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.995878">
5.2 Exogenous Features
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999568">
Exogenous features are features that are not entirely
derived from the (reference) corpus itself. They are
computed from external data (in our case, our lexical
resources). The lexical resources might be useful to
discover new expressions: usually, expressions that
have standard syntax like nominal compounds and
are difficult to predict from the endogenous features.
The resources are applied to the corpus through a
lexical analysis that generates, for each sentence, a
finite-state automaton TFSA which represents all the
possible analyses. The features are computed from
the automaton TFSA.
Lexicon-based features. We associate each word
with its part-of-speech tags found in our external
morphological lexicon. All tags of a word constitute
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.996326">
208
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999826133333334">
an ambiguity class ac. If the word belongs to a com-
pound, the compound tag is also incorporated in the
ambiguity class. For instance, the word night (either
a simple noun or a simple adjective) in the context at
night, is associated with the class adj noun adv+I as
it is located inside a compound adverb. This feature
is directly computed from TFSA. The lexical anal-
ysis can lead to a preliminary MWE segmentation
by using a shortest path algorithm that gives priority
to compound analyses. This segmentation is also a
source of features: a word belonging to a compound
segment is assigned different properties such as the
segment part-of-speech mwt and its syntactic struc-
ture mws encoded in the lexical resource, its relative
position mwpos in the segment (’B’ or ’I’).
Collocation-based features. In our collocation re-
source, each candidate collocation of the French
treebank is associated with its internal syntactic
structure and its association score (log-likelihood).
We divided these candidates into two classes: those
whose score is greater than a threshold and the other
ones. Therefore, a given word in the corpus can be
associated with different properties whether it be-
longs to a potential collocation: the class c and the
internal structure cs of the collocation it belongs to,
its position cpos in the collocation (B: beginning; I:
remaining positions; O: outside). We manually set
the threshold to 150 after some tuning on the devel-
opment corpus.
All feature templates are given in table 2.

6.1 Experiment Setup
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9691694375">
We carried out 3 different experiments. We first
tested a standalone MWE recognizer based on CRF.
We then combined MWE pregrouping based on
this recognizer and the Berkeley parser5 (Petrov
et al., 2006) trained on the FTB where the com-
pounds were concatenated (BKYc). Finally, we
combined the Berkeley parser trained on the FTB
where the compounds are annotated with specific
non-terminals (BKY), and the reranker. In all exper-
iments, we varied the set of features: endo are all en-
dogenous features; coll and lex include all endoge-
nous features plus collocation-based features and
lexicon-based ones, respectively; all is composed of
both endogenous and exogenous features. The CRF
recognizer relies on the software Wapiti6 (Lavergne
et al., 2010) to train and apply the model, and on
the software Unitex (Paumier, 2011) to apply lexical
resources. The part-of-speech tagger used to extract
POS features was lgtagger7 (Constant and Sigogne,
2011). To train the reranker, we used a MaxEnt al-
gorithm8 as in (Charniak and Johnson, 2005).
Results are reported using several standard mea-
sures, the F1score, unlabeled attachment and Leaf
Ancestor scores. The labeled F1score [F1]9, de-
fined by the standard protocol called PARSEVAL
(Black et al., 1991), takes into account the brack-
eting and labeling of nodes. The unlabeled attache-
ment score [UAS] evaluates the quality of unlabeled

dependencies between words of the sentence10. And
finally, the Leaf-Ancestor score [LA]11 (Sampson,
2003) computes the similarity between all paths (se-
quence of nodes) from each terminal node to the root
node of the tree. The global score of a generated
parse is equal to the average score of all terminal
nodes. Punctuation tokens are ignored in all met-
rics. The quality of MWE identification was evalu-
ated by computing the Fl score on MWE nodes. We
also evaluated the MWE segmentation by using the
unlabeled Fl score (U). In order to compare both ap-
proaches, parse trees generated by BKYc were auto-
matically transformed in trees with the same MWE
annotation scheme as the trees generated by BKY.
In order to establish the statistical significance of
results between two parsing experiments in terms of
Fl and UAS, we used a unidirectional t-test for two
independent samples12. The statistical significance
between two MWE identification experiments was
established by using the McNemar-s test (Gillick
and Cox, 1989). The results of the two experiments
are considered statistically significant with the com-
puted value p &lt; 0.01.

The results of the standalone MWE recognizer are
given in table 3. They show that the lexicon-based
system (lex) reaches the best score. Accuracy is im-
proved by an absolute gain of +6.7 points as com-
pared with BKY parser. The strictly endogenous
system has a +4.9 point absolute gain, +5.4 points
when collocations are added. That shows that most
of the work is done by fully automatically acquired
features (as opposed to features coming from a man-
ually constructed lexicon). As expected, lexicon-
based features lead to a 5.3 point recall improve-

the non lexicon-based systems, i.e. it is the best one

detect irregular syntactic structures that are likely to

candidates; the precision is therefore very low (the
worst).

Firstly, we note that the accuracy of the best re-
alistic parsers is much lower than that of a parser
with a golden MWE segmentation13 (-2.65 and -5.92
respectively in terms of F-score and UAS), which
shows the importance of not neglecting MWE recog-
nition in the framework of parsing. Furthermore,
pre-grouping has no statistically significant impact
on the F-score14, whereas reranking leads to a sta-
tistically significant improvement (except for col-
locations). Both strategies also lead to a statisti-
cally significant UAS increase. Whereas both strate-
gies improve the MWE recognition, pre-grouping
is much more accurate (+2-4%); this might be due
to the fact that an unlexicalized parser is limited in
terms of compound identification, even within n-
best analyses (cf. Oracle in table 6). The benefits of
lexicon-based features are confirmed in this experi-
ment, whereas the use of collocations in the rerank-
ing strategy seems to be rejected.

word verb recognition. In terms of standard parsing
accuracy, the pre-grouping approach has a very het-
erogeneous impact: Adverbial and Adjective Modi-
fier phrases tend to be more accurate; verbal kernels
and higher level constituents such as relative and
subordinate clauses see their accuracy level drop,
which shows that pre-recognition of MWE can have
a negative impact on general parsing accuracy as
MWE errors propagate to higher level constituents.

7 Conclusions and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999952133333333">
In this paper, we evaluated two discriminative strate-
gies to integrate Multiword Expression Recognition
in probabilistic parsing: (a) pre-grouping MWEs
with a state-of-the-art recognizer and (b) MWE
identification with a reranker after parsing. We
showed that MWE pre-grouping significantly im-
proves compound recognition and unlabeled depen-
dency annotation, which implies that this strategy
could be useful for dependency parsing. The rerank-
ing procedure evenly improves all evaluation scores.
Future work could consist in combining both strate-
gies: pre-grouping could suggest a set of potential
MWE segmentations in order to make it more flexi-
ble for a parser; final decisions would then be made
by the reranker.

This paper evaluates two empirical strategies to integrate multiword units in a real constituency parsing context and shows that the results are not as promising as has sometimes been suggested. Firstly, we show that pregrouping multiword expressions before parsing with a state-of-the-art recognizer improves multiword recognition accuracy and unlabeled attachment score. However, it has no statistically significant impact in terms of F-score as incorrect multiword expression recognition has important side effects on parsing. Secondly, integrating multiword expressions in the parser grammar followed by a reranker specific to such expressions slightly improves all evaluation metrics.</abstract>

They form complex lexical units which, if they are considered, should significantly help parsing. From a theoretical point of view, the integration of multiword expressions in the parsing procedure has been studied for different formalisms: Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (Copestake et al., 2002), Tree Adjoining Grammars (Schuler and Joshi, 2011), etc. From an empirical point of view, their incorporation has also been considered such as in (Nivre and Nilsson, 2004) for dependency parsing and in (Arun and Keller, 2005) in constituency parsing. Although experiments always relied on a corpus where the MWEs were perfectly pre-identified, they showed that pre-grouping such expressions could significantly improve parsing accuracy. Recently, Green et al. (2011) proposed integrating the multiword expressions directly in the grammar without pre-recognizing them. The grammar was trained with a reference treebank where MWEs were annotated with a specific non-terminal node. Our proposal is to evaluate two discriminative strategies in a real constituency parsing context: (a) pre-grouping MWE before parsing; this would </context>

The CRF recognizer relies on the software Wapiti6 (Lavergne et al., 2010) to train and apply the model, and on the software Unitex (Paumier, 2011) to apply lexical resources.

The features used for MWER will be described in section 5. 3.2 Reranking Discriminative reranking consists in reranking the nbest parses of a baseline parser with a discriminative model, hence integrating features associated with each node of the candidate parses. Charniak and Johnson (2005) introduced different features that showed significant improvement in general parsing accuracy (e.g. around +1 point in English). Formally, given a sentence s, the reranker selects the best candidate parse p among a set of candidates P(s) with respect to a scoring function Vθ: p* = argmaxpEP(s)Vθ(p) The set of candidates P(s) corresponds to the n-best parses generated by the baseline parser.

Given the n-best parses, we want to select the one with the best MWE segmentation by keeping the overall parsing accuracy as high as possible.

The results were rather low on the Genia corpus and Green et al. (2011) confirmed these bad results on the French Treebank. This can be explained by the fact that such a method does not make any distinctions between the different types of MWEs and the reference corpora are usually limited to certain types of MWEs. Furthermore, the lexicon-driven and collocation-driven approaches do not take the context into account, and therefore cannot discard some of the incorrect candidates. A recent trend is to couple MWE recognition with a linguistic analyzer: a POS tagger (Constant and Sigogne, 2011) or a parser (Green et al., 2011). Constant and Sigogne (2011) trained a unified Conditional Random Fields model integrating different standard tagging features and features based on external lexical resources. They show a general tagging accuracy of 94% on the French Treebank. In terms of Multiword expression recognition, the accuracy was not term. 205 clearly evaluated, but seemed to reach around 70- 80% F-score. Green et al.

This implies a theoretical limitation: recognized MWEs must be contiguous. The proposed annotation scheme is therefore theoretically weaker than the one proposed by Green et al. (2011) that integrates the MWER in the grammar and allows for discontinuous MWEs. Nevertheless, in practice, the compounds we are dealing with are very rarely discontinuous and if so, they solely contain a single word insert that can be easily integrated in the MWE sequence. Constant and Sigogne (2011) proposed to combine MWE segmentation and part-of-speech tagging into a single sequence labelling task by assigning to each token a tag of the form TAG+X where TAG is the part-ofspeech (POS) of the lexical unit the token belongs to and X is either B (i.e. the token is at the beginning of the lexical unit) or I (i.e. for the remaining positions): John/N+B hates/V+B traffic/N+B jams/N+I.

They form complex lexical units which, if they are considered, should significantly help parsing. From a theoretical point of view, the integration of multiword expressions in the parsing procedure has been studied for different formalisms: Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (Copestake et al., 2002), Tree Adjoining Grammars (Schuler and Joshi, 2011), etc. From an empirical point of view, their incorporation has also been considered such as in (Nivre and Nilsson, 2004) for dependency parsing and in (Arun and Keller, 2005) in constituency parsing. Although experiments always relied on a corpus where the MWEs were perfectly pre-identified, they showed that pre-grouping such expressions could significantly improve parsing accuracy. Recently, Green et al. (2011) proposed integrating the multiword expressions directly in the grammar without pre-recognizing them. The grammar was trained with a </context>

We also evaluated the MWE segmentation by using the unlabeled Fl score (U). In order to compare both approaches, parse trees generated by BKYc were automatically transformed in trees with the same MWE annotation scheme as the trees generated by BKY. In order to establish the statistical significance of results between two parsing experiments in terms of Fl and UAS, we used a unidirectional t-test for two independent samples12. The statistical significance between two MWE identification experiments was established by using the McNemar-s test (Gillick and Cox, 1989).

They are often divided into two main classes: multiword expressions defined through linguistic idiomaticity criteria (lexicalized phrases in the terminology of Sag et al.

Most linguistic criteria used to determine whether a combination of words is a MWE are based on syntactic and semantic tests such as the ones described in (Gross, 1986). For instance, the utterance at night is a MWE because it does display a strict lexical restriction (*at day, *at afternoon) and it does not accept any inserting material (*at cold night, *at present night).

In this paper, we use two largecoverage general-purpose dictionaries: Dela (Courtois, 1990; Courtois et al., 1997) and Lefff (Sagot, 2010). The Dela was manually developed in the 90’s by a team of linguists. We used the distribution freely available in the platform Unitex3 (Paumier, 2011). It is composed of 840,813 lexical entries including 104,350 multiword ones (91,030 multiword nouns). The compounds present in the resources respect the linguistic criteria defined in (Gross, 1986). The lefff is a freely available dictionary4 that has been automatically compiled by drawing from different sources and that has been manually validated. We used a version with 553,138 lexical entries including 26,311 multiword ones (22,673 multiword nouns). Their different modes of acquisition makes those two resources complementary. In both, lexical entries are composed of a inflected form, a lem</context>

Finally, we combined the Berkeley parser trained on the FTB where the compounds are annotated with specific non-terminals (BKY), and the reranker. In all experiments, we varied the set of features: endo are all endogenous features; coll and lex include all endogenous features plus collocation-based features and lexicon-based ones, respectively; all is composed of both endogenous and exogenous features. The CRF recognizer relies on the software Wapiti6 (Lavergne et al., 2010) to train and apply the model, and on the software Unitex (Paumier, 2011) to apply lexical resources. The part-of-speech tagger used to extract POS features was lgtagger7 (Constant and Sigogne, 2011). To train the reranker, we used a MaxEnt algorithm8 as in (Charniak and Johnson, 2005). Results are reported using several standard measures, the F1score, unlabeled attachment and Leaf Ancestor scores. The labeled F1score [F1]9, defined by the standard protocol called PARSEVAL (Black et al., 1991), takes into account the bracketing and labeling of nodes.

The main drawback is that this procedure entirely relies on a lexicon and is unable to discover unknown MWEs. The use of collocation statistics is therefore useful. For instance, for each candidate in the text, Watrin and Franc¸ois (2011) compute on the fly its association score from an external ngram base learnt from a large raw corpus, and tag it as MWE if the association score is greater than a threshold. They reach excellent scores in the framework of a keyword extraction task. Within a validation framework (i.e. with the use of a reference corpus annotated in MWEs), Ramisch et al. (2010) developped a Support Vector Machine classifier integrating features corresponding to different collocation association measures. The results were rather low on the Genia corpus and Green et al. (2011) confirmed these bad results on the French Treebank. This can be explained by the fact that such a method does not make any distinctions between the different types of MWEs and the reference corpora are usually limited to certain types of MWEs. Furthermore, the lexicon-driven and collocation-driven approaches do not take the context into account, and therefore cannot discard some of the incorrect</context>

Both methods have the advantage of being able to discover new MWEs on the basis of lexical and syntactic contexts. In this paper, we will take advantage of the methods described in this section by integrating them as features of a MWER model. 3 Two strategies, two discriminative models 3.1 Pre-grouping Multiword Expressions MWER can be seen as a sequence labelling task (like chunking) by using an IOB-like annotation scheme (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995). This implies a theoretical limitation: recognized MWEs must be contiguous. The proposed annotation scheme is therefore theoretically weaker than the one proposed by Green et al. (2011) that integrates the MWER in the grammar and allows for discontinuous MWEs. Nevertheless, in practice, the compounds we are dealing with are very rarely discontinuous and if so, they solely contain a single word insert that can be easily integrated in the MWE sequence.

They cover a wide range of linguistic phenomena: fixed and semi-fixed expressions, light verb constructions, phrasal verbs, named entities, etc. They may be contiguous (e.g. traffic light) or discontinuous (e.g. John took your argument into account). They are often divided into two main classes: multiword expressions defined through linguistic idiomaticity criteria (lexicalized phrases in the terminology of Sag et al. (2002)) and those defined by statistical ones (i.e. simple collocations). Most linguistic criteria used to determine whether a combination of words is a MWE are based on syntactic and semantic tests such as the ones described in (Gross, 1986). For instance, the utterance at night is a MWE because it does display a strict lexical restriction (*at day, *at afternoon) and it does not accept any inserting material (*at cold night, *at present night). Such linguistically defined expressions may overlap with collocations which are the combinations of two or more words that cooccur more often than by chanc</context>

Such expressions can be analyzed at the lexical level. In what follows, we use the term compounds to denote such expressions. 2.2 Identification The idiomaticity property of MWEs makes them both crucial for Natural Language Processing applications and difficult to predict. Their actual identification in texts is therefore fundamental. There are different ways for achieving this objective. The simpler approach is lexicon-driven and consists in looking the MWEs up in an existing lexicon, such as in (Silberztein, 2000). The main drawback is that this procedure entirely relies on a lexicon and is unable to discover unknown MWEs. The use of collocation statistics is therefore useful. For instance, for each candidate in the text, Watrin and Franc¸ois (2011) compute on the fly its association score from an external ngram base learnt from a large raw corpus, and tag it as MWE if the association score is greater than a threshold.
