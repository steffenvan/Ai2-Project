<bodyText confidence="0.999899625">
This paper reports an exploratory study of
the grounding styles of older dyads, namely,
the characteristic ways in which they
mutually agree to have shared a piece of
information in dialogue. On the basis of
Traum’s classification of grounding acts,
we conducted an exploratory comparison of
dialogue data on older and younger dyads,
and found that a fairly clear contrast holds
mainly in the types of acknowledgement
utterances used by the two groups. We will
discuss the implications of this contrast,
concerning how some of the negative
stereotypes about conversations with older
people may arise from this difference in
grounding styles.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999838528">
Clark (1996) developed the notion of grounding to
capture intricate processes with which conversants
establish a set of information as a shared common
ground for on-going (and possibly subsequent)
dialogue. In a grounding process, a conversant
presents a piece of information verbally or
non-verbally, and the partner issues a particular
public signal of the receipt, understanding, or
acceptance of that information. Once a piece of
information is thus incorporated into a common
ground, it is available as something than can be
presupposed in subsequent communication, in
which still another change to the common ground
is worked out.
On the basis of Clark’s work, Traum (1994)
shows a way of substantiating the process of
grounding in a finite-state transition model, which
specifies what contributions to a grounding
process can be made by individual utterances in
dialogue and how individual contributions
combine themselves to make a sequence that
completes the grounding. In Traum’s terms, such
contributions are grounding acts, and the units of
utterance that can perform grounding acts are
utterance units, and the sequences of utterance
units that complete are discourse units.
Now, both Clark’s and Traum’s models of
grounding are generic, in the sense that they both
admit a significant range of forms or styles in
which actual processes of grounding may take
place. That is, their models tell us what forms of
grounding sequences are possible or well-formed,
but do not tell what particular forms are most
frequent in actual dialogues or, more specifically,
what forms are most frequent in what sorts of
dialogue situations. Thus, on the basis of Clark’s
and Traum’s work, natural questions arise as to
grounding styles, namely, the possibility of
characteristic forms of grounding sequences
adopted by particular types of conversants in
particular types of occasions.
This paper investigates this question in its
special application to casual, non-task-oriented
dialogues conducted by aged people. Do people
develop a characteristic style of grounding as they
age? If so, what exactly distinguish their grounding
styles in casual, non-task-oriented settings?
To address these questions, we collected a
spoken dialogue data comprising both older dyads
and younger dyads, and analyzed the grounding
processes in our data on the basis of Traum’s
finite-state model.
Why are we particularly interested in possible
grounding styles of aged people? It is rather
common that younger people find difficult or get
frustrated in conversing with aged people. Thus, a
common stereotype says that conversations with
aged people are slow-paced, repetitive, and
therefore boring. It is perhaps because of these
oft-felt problems that younger people often adopt
“patronizing speech styles” or “secondary baby
talk” toward aged people, characterized by
restricted topics, childlike expressions, directive
speech, and exaggerated nonverbal signals (Ryan
&amp; Hummert, 1995) or by slower speech, varied
paraphrases, decreased grammatical complexity,
lower propositional density, and other
modifications (Kemper &amp; Vandeputte, 1995).
Now, it seems customary that these
communicative problems between older people
and younger people are attributed to the side of
aged people only, to their difficulties in auditory
reception, alleged slowness of understanding, and
alleged stubbornness in accepting new ideas.
However, they may not be problems with one side
only, nor problems with cognitive capacities or
personal characters of aged people, but may largely
come from different grounding styles adopted by
the two groups of people. That is, the ways they
agree to have a piece of information shared may
have different recurrent patterns, and this
difference may be a real cause of the difficulty and
the negative stereotype. If so, digging out this
difference and identifying the characteristic
grounding styles of aged people are a necessity for
scientific treatments of communicative problems
commonly attributed to aged people, as well as
informed design of dialogue systems that interact
with aged people.
Nevertheless, most studies related to
communications of aged people have focused on
the influence of aging on basic linguistic
competence such as word retrievals (Tatsumi 1997,
Ministry of Health and Welfare 1999), and studies
of their behaviors in actual dialogues have been
quite scarce. The studies by Ryan &amp; Hummert
(1995) and Kemper &amp; Vandeputte (1995) did touch
on the conversational styles adopted by aged
people, but their focus was more on the
conversational styles adopted by younger people
toward aged people. The study by Bortfeld et al.
(2001) was exceptional in that it measured the
number of fillers, restarts, and repairs to evaluate
disfluency of aged people’s speech in
conversational settings. Yet, the focus of this study
was on the characteristics of speech by individual
conversants, rather than the ways in which they
interact. Thus, conversational styles of aged people,
let alone their grounding styles, have been seldom
studied systematically.
Under this situation, we have no specific
hypothesis as to whether aged people have any
characteristic grounding styles and if so, what they
are. Our purpose in this study is therefore
exploratory, dedicated to a search for plausible
hypotheses about grounding styles of aged dyads,
rather than a verification of their existence and
specifics. Although our study is thus hypothetical
in nature, we did identify two clearly
distinguishable grounding styles in our data,
correlated with the age ranges of conversants. In
the following, we will report what they are, how
they are found, and what implications their
difference has as to some negative stereotypes
about conversations with aged people.

The details of the corpus, its collection, and the

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.994551">
2.1 Dialogue Data
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999962516129032">
Our data consist of 5 dialogues by older dyads (age
range: 80-88, sd: 2.1) and 5 dialogues by younger
dyads (age range: 23-39, sd: 5.2). Most of the older
participants were therefore so-called “older-olds,”
meaning that they were between 75 and 85 years of
age. Familiarities of the older dyads were strong:
they had known each other since they were
children or after they moved into the current areas
of residence, although they started talking each
other frequently after they joined an common local
association several years ago. The younger dyads
were also familiar with each other: they had
worked in the same department of an institute for at
least 3 months and up to 5 years and had talked
with each other almost every working day.
Dialogues of older dyads were videotaped in a
community center that the subjects regularly visit
for activities of their association. Videotaping of
younger adults took place in a lounge space of their
work place. The dialogues were casual
conversations in Japanese, involving no specific
objectives or tasks. The dialogue topics between
older dyads included community events, common
friends, their girlhood, and garden work, while the
topics between younger adults included their job,
their children, their cars, and common friends. The
length of a dialogue in either group was from 30 to
50 minutes. Older adults participated in our data
collection on the voluntary basis, while we paid a
small amount of money for participation of
younger adults.

2.2 Transcription and coding
Transcription
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999925230769231">
We transcribed a 5-minute portion after 3 minutes
from the beginning of each dialogue. All words
and word fragments audible to the ear were
transcribed, including overlapping speech,
nonlexical fillers (such as “uh”), and other
vocalizations (such as laughter and whistle). After
each dialogue was transcribed, we checked the
videotape to add data of all noddings and salient
gestures (facial expressions and hand movements)
to the transcription. The transcriber solicited the
help of some local residents to understand some of
the dialectical expressions contained used in
dialogues by older dyads.

<bodyText confidence="0.999950416666667">
On the basis of Traum’s finite-state transition
model of grounding, we divided all speech in our
dialogue data into utterance units (UUs), namely,
“continuous speech by the same speaker,
punctuated by prosodic boundaries (including
pauses of significant length and boundary tones)”
(Traum, 1994). One of the present authors then
classified each utterance unit into one of seven
categories of grounding acts, according to its
contribution to a grounding process. Table 1 shows
the seven categories of grounding acts and their
definitions.

Reliability
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999995962962963">
To check the reliability of our coding scheme, we
asked two independent subjects to code a portion
of our data and compared their results with our
own. As an instruction to these independent coders,
we produced a coding manual that lists Traum’s
definitions of the seven categories of grounding
acts (see Table 1), sample utterances of each
category, and some general notes on treatments of
marginal cases such as fillers, simultaneous
utterances, and utterances with both Init and Ack
functions. The subjects did some exercise coding
before actual coding, and they were encouraged to
ask questions about the coding standard during the
exercise period. Both transcribed text and audio
recording were available to the subjects during the
actual coding. The subjects coded two partial
dialogues one from older dyads and the other from
younger dyads. Each dialogue was about 2.5
minute in length.
The interrater reliability among the original
coder and these two subjects was excellent; there
was an 83% agreement, with a Cohen’s Kappa
of .78, for dialogues by older dyads (UUs = 138,
coders = 3, categories = 9) and a 78% agreement,
with a Cohen’s Kappa .77, for dialogues by
younger dyads (UUs = 128, coders = 3, categories
= 9).

Thus, our data comprise both dialogues by older
dyads and ones by younger dyads, but these two
groups of dialogues were not tightly controlled in
their settings and therefore are not appropriate for
exact comparison. For the limited purpose of
exploratory data analysis, however, it is
convenient to tentatively divide our data into these
two groups and compare them from various points
of view. This section reports four main results of
such exploratory comparisons, in terms of (1) the

3.1 Utterance units and discourse units
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999755416666667">
The two groups of dialogues had no significant
differences in the total numbers of discourse units
(older adults, 446; younger adults, 482) and the
total numbers of utterance units (older adults,
1406; younger adults, 1309). This roughly means
that older dyads grounded information as
frequently as younger dyads, and the numbers of
utterances needed for each grounding are about the
same in older dyads and in younger dyads.
Also, the frequencies of occurrences of the
seven categories of grounding acts were about the
same in older dyads and younger dyads (Figure 1).

3.2 Types of Acknowledgements
Initiation-acknowledgements
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996612272727273">
Generally, an “acknowledgement act” appears at
the end of a grounding unit, indicating that
conversants have mutually understood what the
presenter said. In contrast, an “initiate act” appears
at the beginning of a grounding unit, initiating the
presentation of a new information unit. Sometimes,
a speaker performs both initiation and
acknowledgement at the same time, by producing
an initiation utterance whose content presupposes
the understanding of the preceding presentation.
An example is found in dialogue excerpt (1)

Beside these dual-functional acknowledgments,

as “acknowledgements” but not as anything else.
Inside these dedicated acknowledgements,
however, we can distinguish two types. One type

special-purpose acknowledgements, such as
repeating or paraphrasing responses, whose
contents must vary depending on the contents of

general-purpose acknowledgement is speaker A’s
short utterance “n (m)” in excerpt (2). In contrast,
speaker B’s utterance “n-n-mite (m, you saw it)” in

special purpose acknowledgements are subtler
than suggested here. For example, an utterance that
sounds “n (m)” could be classified as
special-purpose if it has a marked prosodic feature

Interestingly, older dyads produced more
general-purpose acknowledgements (43%) than

Dialogues conducted by older dyads contained
several instances of requests for acknowledgement

younger dyads contained no such instances (older
dyads, 9; younger dyads, 0). For example, the
second request for acknowledgement “ne (see?)”
towards the end of excerpt (4) was issued after the
acknowledgment “n (m)” by speaker A, requesting
further acknowledgement of the presentation
“watashi-no-shita-wo (and my younger sister)”
that had been already grounded. This phenomenon
is particularly interesting since a request for
acknowledgement after acknowledgement is not in
the scope of Traum’s finite-state transition model
of grounding sequences.

Thus, our exploratory comparison suggests several
points of difference between dialogues by older
dyads and dialogues by younger dyads. What
would these individual differences reveal about
common stereotypes about conversations with
aged people? Do these individual differences
combine themselves to define two different
grounding styles attributable to older and younger
dyads?

utterances were less frequent in older
dyads.
Initiation-acknowledgements are dual-functional
utterances, performing two grounding acts by
single utterance units. Dedicated
acknowledgments are mono-functional,
performing single grounding functions per single
utterance units. Thus, if we define the grounding
tempo of a given part of dialogue as the ratio of the
number of utterance units to the number of
different grounding acts performed by them, then
an occurrence of initiation-acknowledgement
certainly increases the grounding tempo of the
local context.
In contrast, a dedicated acknowledgement has
no such accelerative effect on grounding tempo,
and a frequent use of dedicated acknowledgements
may even cause impressions of relative slowness
of the grounding tempo in the local context. Now
our exploratory comparison indicated that older
dyads used dedicated acknowledgements more
frequently than younger dyads, who used
initiation-acknowledgements more frequently. It is
then plausible that this contrast in the kinds of
frequently used acknowledgements underlies the
common impression that conversations with older
people are slow-paced and, since the grounding
tempo is related to how efficiently information is
shared, this contrast might partially account for the
common impression that older people understand
things slowly.

<bodyText confidence="0.9997175">
In this regard, an occurrence of post-grounding
acknowledgment must have a deceleration effect
on the grounding tempo in the local context. For
the grounding function it performs, namely, the
acknowledgement of the presented information, is
one that has been done by the preceding
acknowledgement, and thus the ratio of the number
of utterance units to the number of grounding
functions performed by them is even worse than
the case of dedicated acknowledgments. Now
again, our exploratory comparison indicated that
older dyads used post-grounding
acknowledgements more frequently than younger
dyads. This contrast therefore might be an added
cause to the stereotypes mentioned above,
slow-pacedness and slow-understanding.

Precisely because the form of a general-purpose
acknowledgement, such as “uh-huh” and “m,”
does not depend on the content of the utterance
being acknowledged, a general-purpose
acknowledgement gives only weak evidence of
reception or understanding of the content. In
contrast, a special-purpose acknowledgement,
such as repeating or paraphrasing responses, has
stronger evidentiality, since its form is the result of
an appropriate choice relative to the content of the
acknowledged utterance. Now, our preliminary
comparison indicated that older dyads used
general-purpose acknowledgements more
frequently than younger dyads, and this contrast
may well be still another cause to the negative
stereotype on older people’s capacities for
understanding during conversation.

4.4 Two Grounding Styles
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996632194444445">
Overall, our exploratory comparison suggests a
particular style of grounding as characteristic to
older dyads. That is, older dyads use more
dedicated acknowledgments than dual-functional
acknowledgements involving initiations, and
among dedicated acknowledgements, older dyads
use more general-purpose acknowledgements than
special-purpose acknowledgements; they also use
post-grounding acknowledgements relatively often,
either spontaneously or solicited by requests for
acknowledgements. Let us call this grounding style
style A, and call the grounding style characterized
by the opposite tendencies style B.
Now we have obtained this hypothetical
contrast in grounding styles through an overall
comparison of the entire group of older dyads and
the entire group of younger dyads. So the question
remains how much this contrast applies to
individual dyads of older and younger people.
Aren’t there any exceptional older dyads with
grounding style B? Any younger dyads with
grounding style A?
To address these questions, we re-evaluated our
data and ranked all ten dialogues in our data
according to the ratios of dedicated
acknowledgements, the ratios of general-purpose
acknowledgements, and the counts of
post-grounding acknowledgements (solicited
acknowledgements and spontaneous
acknowledgements). Table 2 shows the result of
ranking, where the hatched cells indicate dialogues
by older dyads. Here we see that the contrast of
style A and style B divides older dyads and
younger dyads fairly clearly. In fact, the separation
of older and younger dyads is statistically
significant in the ratio of dedicated
acknowledgements (W0&gt;=w5,5(0.01)=39,
two-tailed), the ratio of general-purpose
acknowledgements (W0&gt;=w5,5(0.025)=38,
two-tailed) and the counts of solicited
post-grounding acknowledgements (E(R)=27.5,
V(R)=36, Z0=3.75, Z(a)=3.09, p&lt;0.002,
two-tailed). Thus, our hypothesis associating style
A to older dyads and style B to younger dyads
receives some initial supports from this analysis.
On the other hand, Table 2 also shows certain
exceptions to this association, namely, some older
dyads with style B and some younger dyads with
style A. This is only natural as we can easily
imagine older people who talk like younger people
as well as younger people who talk like older
people. Styles are styles, and they are not natural
traits exclusively possessed by particular species
of creatures.

5 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999956347826087">
As a pilot study of the grounding styles of older
dyads, we analyzed dialogue data featuring both
older and younger dyads, and identified a certain
contrast in grounding style that separates the two
groups fairly clearly. In the style associated with
older dyads, people use more dedicated
acknowledgements than dual-functional ones, use
more general-purpose acknowledgements than
special-purpose ones, and use relatively many
post-grounding acknowledgements. In the style
associated with younger dyads, the opposite
tendencies on the use of acknowledgements hold.
On the basis of this contrast, we also discussed the
implications of the adoption of the first grounding
style, and conjectured that some of the negative
stereotypes about conversations with older people
may be based on this grounding style they adopt.
Certainly, as the result of an exploratory study, all
these observations are purely hypothetical. We
only hope that this study has provided enough
materials to set a stage for a further, more
controlled comparison of grounding styles of older
and younger dyads.

In a grounding process, a conversant presents a piece of information verbally or non-verbally, and the partner issues a particular public signal of the receipt, understanding, or acceptance of that information. Once a piece of information is thus incorporated into a common ground, it is available as something than can be presupposed in subsequent communication, in which still another change to the comm</context>

The transcriber solicited the help of some local residents to understand some of the dialectical expressions contained used in dialogues by older dyads. Coding On the basis of Traum’s finite-state transition model of grounding, we divided all speech in our dialogue data into utterance units (UUs), namely, “continuous speech by the same speaker, punctuated by prosodic boundaries (including pauses of significant length and boundary tones)” (Traum, 1994). One of the present authors then classified each utterance unit into one of seven categories of grounding acts, according to its contribution to a grounding process.
