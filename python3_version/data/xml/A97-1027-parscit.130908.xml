Abstract
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99975725">
In this paper, we want to show how the
morphological component of an existing
NLP-system for Dutch (Dutch Medical
Language Processor - DMLP) has been ex-
tended in order to produce output that is
compatible with the language independent
modules of the LSP-MLP system (Linguis-
tic String Project - Medical Language Pro-
cessor) of the New York University. The
former can take advantage of the language
independent developments of the latter,
while focusing on idiosyncrasies for Dutch.
This general strategy will be illustrated by
a practical application, namely the high-
lighting of relevant information in a pa-
tient discharge summary (PDS) by means
of modern HyperText Mark-Up Language
(HTML) technology. Such an application
can be of use for medical administrative
purposes in a hospital environment.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.99695002">
Medical patient reports consist mainly of free text.
While numerical data can be stored and processed
(relatively) easily, free text is rather difficult to pro-
cess by a computer, although in many cases it con-
tains the most relevant information.
The use of natural language does not facilitate the
automation of. these tasks and hinders access to the
wealth of medical information. However, natural lan-
guage still is the most frequently used and easiest
way to transmit complex messages (Scherrer et al.,
1989). Hence, some authors consider the study and
application of Natural Language Processing (NLP)
in Medicine (Scherrer et: al., 1989), (McCray- et al..
1995), (Chute, 1997) as one of the most challenging
issues in the field of medical information retrieval
(Baud et al., 1992a), (Friedman and Johnson, 1992).
Up till now, not many NLP-driven systems have ac-
tually been implemented (Spyns, 1996b). A concise
overview of NLP-based information retrieval tech-
niques for clinical narrative can be found in (Hersh,
1996, chapter 11, pp. 211-323).
A possible environment for (medical) information
retrieval is the Medical Registration Department of
a hospital, and more in particular the medical en-
coding service. Clinical data in free text format are
replaced by a set of numerical codes that summarise
the content of the entire document. In general, the
patient discharge summary (PDS), being a synthe-
sis of the patient stay, is used for the encoding and
abstracting task instead of the entire medical record
(Duisterhout, 1996). An important aspect of med-
ical encoding consists of a thorough review of the
PDS in order to discover the relevant words (diag-
noses, surgical deeds, interventional equipment etc.)
(Bowman, 1996, p.216). The aim of the NLP-based
HTML application presented below is to speed up
the reviewing process by displaying a PDS and high-
lighting the keywords.
The following sections provide details about some
aspects of NLP systems for medical English (section
2.1: LSP-MLP) and Dutch (section 2.2: DMLP), and
how results can be exchanged between them (sec-
tion 2.3). Only some parts of the DMLP and LSP-
MLP systems will be presented, namely those that
are of importance for the experiment described be-
low. Next to the NLP back-end, the user interface
is described as well (section 2.4). The limitations
of the current test are described in section 3 and
some future directions for research are provided in
the fourth and final section.

is the first (and up till now the longest lasting) large
scale project about NLP in Medicine (Sager et al.,
1987), (Sager et al., 1995a). The LSP-MLP has
also been ported to French and German, which il-
lustrates the general applicability of its methodology
and approach (Nhan et al., 1989), (Oliver, 1992).
The reason of its generality lies in the use of a well
defined underlying linguistic theory (distributional-
ism) (Harris, 1962), (Sager et al., 1981) and a scien-
tifically based sublanguage approach (Grishman and
Kittredge, 1986).
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.673669966666667">
Important for the present discussion is the seman-
tic selection level of the LSP-MLP. All the words
in the LSP dictionary are characterised by labels
that indicate to which sublanguage word class(es)
the words belong (e.g., H-TTCHIR: &amp;quot;contains general
and specific surgical treatment or procedure words
which imply or denote surgical intervention by the
physician&amp;quot; (Sager et al., 1987, p.268); H-TXPROC:
&amp;quot;contains medical test words designating procedures
performed on the patient and not on a patient spec-
iment. The patient must be present to undergo the
test&amp;quot; (Sager et al., 1987, p.264) ). An overview
of the actual set of labels and word classes can be
found in (Sager et al., 1995a). The semantic se-
lection module uses distributionally established co-
occurrence patterns of medical word classes to im-
prove the parse tree by resolving cases of structural
ambiguity (Hirschman, 1986). Consider the sentence
63 &amp;quot;operatieve procedure: vijfvoudige coronaire by-
pass.&amp;quot; 1 displayed in figure 4. The word &amp;quot;proce-
dure&amp;quot; is semantically ambiguous because it has two
semantic labels: H-TTCHIR &amp; H-TXPROC. Thanks
to the co-occurrence patterns for the medical sub-
language, only the label that is valid in this context
(H-TTCHIR) is ultimately selected. In another con-
text (e.g.: test procedure: ...), another co-occurrence
pattern will apply and select the H-TXPROC reading.
Other examples of resolution of word sense ambigui-
ties by means of co-occurrence patterns can be found
in (Sager et al., 1987, pp.83, 95).

The very latest work includes the use of Stan-
dard Generalized Mark-up Language (SGML) and
World Wide Web (WWW) Graphical User Interface
(GUI) technology to access and visualise better the
requested information in the text (Sager et al., 1996).
It focused on the use of static SGML or HTML-code

screening of clinical documents.

2.2 The Dutch Medical Language Processor
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999909173913044">
For the Dutch medical language, an NLP system of
a medium sized coverage has been designed and im-
plemented: the Dutch Medical Language Processor
(DMLP) (Spyns, 1996c). With respect to the mor-
phological level, there is a full form dictionary stored
in the relational database format (currently some
100.000 full forms that are mostly non-compound
wordforms) (Dehaspe, 1993). If necessary, a recog-
niser characterises the unknown word forms morpho-
logically (Spyns, 1994). Subsequently, a contextual
disambiguation component tries to reduce the num-
ber of morphological readings (Spyns, 1995).
As the syntactic level uses a &amp;quot;logic variant&amp;quot; of the
LSP grammar formalism (Hirschman and Dowding,
1990), the Dutch morpho-syntactic module (Spyns
and Adriaens, 1992) can replace the LSP parser.
Many of the LSP-MLP medical co-occurrence pat-
terns are practically identical for English, French
and German, so that the application of these pat-
terns to Dutch parse trees can lead to interesting
results, namely the feasibility of reusing the non lan-
guage specific parts of the LSP-MLP for Dutch med-
ical NLP (Spyns, 1996a).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.994677">
2.3 The DMLP/LSP-MLP connection
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998905">
The linguistic data are passed on from the DMLP to
the LSP-MLP system via syntactic parse trees. This
is due to the fact that the selection module takes syn-
tactic relationships into account during the semantic
disambiguating phase.
The linguistic information of the DMLP and the
LSP-MLP systems correspond in a high degree. Se-
mantic word class labels, which were originally not
foreseen in the Dutch lexicon, had to be added. A
parse tree transducer delivers nearly genuine Dutch
LSP-MLP trees (Spyns, 1996a). Although on the
side of the LSP-MLP some new sublanguage seman-
tic co-occurrence patterns had to be defined, the
co-occurrence patterns are highly language indepen-
dent. This was in line with results earlier achieved.
An example (see figure 1) shows the output of the
parse tree transducer that reshapes the DMLP tree
into the required LSP-MLP format. The current
state of the transducer allows to transform nearly
all the parse trees.

The highlighting of medical concepts of
interest makes it possible to scan a docu-
ment quickly, focusing on a particular type
of information, such as Symptoms and Di-
agnoses, or Treatments resolved (?, p.26).
Also for the medico-administrative activities, such
a tool can also be helpful. Medical secretaries have to
summarise patient discharge summaries by &amp;quot;trans-
lating&amp;quot; them into a fixed set of numerical codes of
a classification (ICD-9-CM (Commission of Profes-
sional and Hospital Activities, 1978)). These codes
(indirectly) serve for statistical and financial pur-
poses. If the most important relevant terms for
the encoding task (essentially the H-DIAG (diagno-
sis) and the H-TTCHIR (surgical deed) words) are
already highlighted, the human encoder is able to
detect them more rapidly so that the encoding speed
can be improved.
The documents are morphologically and syntacti-
cally analysed by the DMLP first, the resulting parse
trees being made conform to the LSP-format, and
subsequently passed 3 on to the LSP-MLP.
The LSP subselection module generates a pseudo-
HTML file consisting of semantic labels and the ter-
minal elements of the parse trees. The file with
the pseudo-HTML codes (see figure 3) could eas-
ily have been generated by the morphological com-
ponent of the DMLP as well. In some occasions,
it would be better to do so as the DMLP-LSP tree
converter sometimes changes the word order. On the
other hand, no advantage can then be taken from
the sublanguage co-occurrence patterns for seman-
tic disambiguation. Semantically ambiguous words
will thus be highlighted more than once, which is
bad for the precision score (more non relevant words
are flagged). Without full fledged linguistic analysis,
some ambiguities will not be resolved (?, p.27). As
can be seen in figure 2 (and thus also in figure 3),
the ambiguity for the word &amp;quot;procedure&amp;quot; in sentence
63 is resolved. The node number 2 only has the label
H-TTCHIR.
3Currently, the files are transmitted by e-mail.

The GUI consists of two WWW-pages. The first
page is conceived as a menu window. Two selection
boxes allow the medical encoder to choose a text
and the semantic labels. Currently, the set of PDSs
is limited to nine texts. In the future, HTML-files
for an unrestricted and varying number of PDSs will
have to be produced. Before the encoder can start
to view the NLP-processed PDSs, the HTML-code
of the menu-page needs to be updated to include all
the (path)names of the files concerned. This can
easily be achieved by activating before each encoding
session a C-shell script that scans a subdirectory and
creates an actualised HTML-file for the menu page.
Only the &amp;quot; &lt; OPTION &gt;&lt; /OPTION &gt;&amp;quot; lines of
the first choice box need to be adapted.
Through the HTML SUBMIT command, the op-
tions selected by the medical encoder are passed (via
a FORM and CGI-SCRIPT) to an external C-program.
The C-program takes the filename and the requested
sublanguage label(s) as parameters and generates

a new HTML-file by replacing the occurrences of
the concerned label(s) by a genuine HTML-code

evant words). This temporary file is directly fed into
the browser and displayed as a second WWW-page
(&amp;quot;PDS-page&amp;quot;). The words marked (= belonging to
the selected semantic sublanguage word class) are
displayed in boldface. As the pseudo-HTML codes
are ignored by the browser, the rest of the PDS is
displayed in a &amp;quot;neutral&amp;quot; way.

Before a large scale validation involving &amp;quot;a gold

a modest formative evaluation (Hirschman and

the actual user. A limited validation test has been
set up. A sample of 100 Dutch sentences of varying
length and syntactic complexity was selected. All the
words in the dictionary covering the 100 sentences

For all the 100 sentences, pseudo-HTML code was
generated. The recall was 100 % (all the labels con-
cerned were flagged). The precision ranged from
66% to 100 % depending on the label combination.
Nevertheless, these figures are temporary as exami-
nation of the sentences showed that very few words
had more than one semantic label so that the medi-
cal subselection stage did not have a big impact. A
larger test set needs to be processed in order to pro-
vide more conclusive results. Probably, recall will
drop while precision could raise. Nevertheless, the
experience did prove to be valuable as the collabo-
rating doctor, who had never heard of NLP before,
said he was &amp;quot;positively surprised and impressed&amp;quot; by
the capabilities of the system. He also judged the
tool to be an interesting utility and consented in set-
ting up a larger experiment to measure exactly the
impact of the tool on the daily routine of the medical
encoders. The evaluation procedure of this large test
will be organised to comply as much as possible with
the evaluation criteria recently proposed by Fried-
man and Hripcsak (Friedman and Hripcsak, 1997).

4 Future Research
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999922678571429">
In order to demonstrate the full power of the LSP-
MLP, the same sentences could be processed by
the joint DMLP/LSP-MLP systems and stored in
a RDB table - as is done in other experiments in-
volving the LSP system (Hirschman et al., 1981).
Specific SQL-queries can then return the ID-number
of the sentence with the relevant information instead
of the information itself. If the ID-number is added
to the original document as a pseudo-HTML code,
the same mechanism as mentioned above can be used
to highlight the sentences containing the relevant in-
formation. Several variants on this base scheme can
be thought of.
Following the line of research of Sager (Sager et
al., 1995a) and Wingert (Wingert et al., 1989), clas-
sification codes could already be generated automat-
ically (see also (Lovis et al., 1995)) and presented on
the screen next to the original text. But the human
encoder would remain responsible for the ultimate
selection of the exact codes.
Another possibility is the creation of &amp;quot;views&amp;quot; or
&amp;quot;masks&amp;quot;. HTML files can be generated with &amp;quot;hard
coded&amp;quot; instructions to emphasise fixed combinations
of semantic labels. Buttons in the menu-page allow
to display very rapidly the selected view on the PDS.
Several experiments for English have already been
successfully carried out (?) on the use of &amp;quot;static
WWW-technology&amp;quot;. Interesting as well is the cre-

ation of Document Type Definitions (DTD) that as-
sociate a particular layout with a specific semantic
label (see also (Zweigenbaum et al.. 1997)). The
DTDs can act as a locally defined view (GUI aspect)
on common SGML data (NLP aspect).
Other potential applications in the medical domain
for the DMLP/LSP-MLP combination are e.g., the
determination of patient profiles (Borst et al., 1991),
quality assurance (Lyman et al., 1991) and extrac-
tion of sign/syptom information for medication (Ly-
man et al., 1985). Overviews of the possible utili-
sation in the healthcare area of NLP based systems,
irrespective of their theoretical background, can be
found in (Baud et al., 1992b) &amp; (Sager et al., 1987,
chapter2).
But before any application of such an extent can
be envisaged for Dutch, the words of the dictio-
nary database all have to receive the appropriate
semantic label(s). Luckily, this process can be au-
tomated. The LSP-team has implemented such rou-
tines (Hirschman et al., 1975) but other techniques
could be applied as well (see (Habert et al., 1996)).
From a technical point of view, it would be better
to group all the involved software modules (NLP,
RDBMS, WWW) on the same platform to opti-
mally exploit the potentialities offered by the combi-
nation of the components mentioned. Ultimately, a
client/server architecture (separating language spe-
cific from domain specific issues and the linguistic
aspects from user interface aspects) will be the best
architecture for a real life application.
We can conclude that the application presented
above shows the feasibility to integrate Electronic
Medical Record (EMR) systems with NLP appli-
cations. This is the kernel message of the DOME
project (Bouaud et al., 1996) that advocates the use
of SGML - and HTML-technology for EMR systems.
The above presented WWW-application could thus
be integrated in such a hypertextual EMR system.

<abstract confidence="0.995552428571428">In this paper, we want to show how the morphological component of an existing NLP-system for Dutch (Dutch Medical Language Processor - DMLP) has been extended in order to produce output that is compatible with the language independent modules of the LSP-MLP system (Linguistic String Project - Medical Language Processor) of the New York University. The former can take advantage of the language independent developments of the latter, while focusing on idiosyncrasies for Dutch. This general strategy will be illustrated by a practical application, namely the highlighting of relevant information in a patient discharge summary (PDS) by means of modern HyperText Mark-Up Language (HTML) technology. Such an application can be of use for medical administrative purposes in a hospital environment.</abstract>

With respect to the morphological level, there is a full form dictionary stored in the relational database format (currently some 100.000 full forms that are mostly non-compound wordforms) (Dehaspe, 1993). If necessary, a recogniser characterises the unknown word forms morphologically (Spyns, 1994). Subsequently, a contextual disambiguation component tries to reduce the number of morphological readings (Spyns, 1995). As the syntactic level uses a &amp;quot;logic variant&amp;quot; of the LSP grammar formalism (Hirschman and Dowding, 1990), the Dutch morpho-syntactic module (Spyns and Adriaens, 1992) can replace the LSP parser. Many of the LSP-MLP medical co-occurrence patterns are practically identical for English, French and German, so that the application of these patterns to Dutch parse trees can lead to inte</context>

The use of natural language does not facilitate the automation of. these tasks and hinders access to the wealth of medical information. However, natural language still is the most frequently used and easiest way to transmit complex messages (Scherrer et al., 1989). Hence, some authors consider the study and application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in Medicine (Scherrer et: al., 1989), (McCray- et al.. 1995), (Chute, 1997) as one of the most challenging issues in the field of medical information retrieval (Baud et al., 1992a), (Friedman and Johnson, 1992). Up till now, not many NLP-driven systems have actually been implemented (Spyns, 1996b). A concise overview of NLP-based information retrieval techniques for clinical narrative can be found in (Hersh, 1996, chapter 11, pp. 211-323).

The LSP-MLP has also been ported to French and German, which illustrates the general applicability of its methodology and approach (Nhan et al., 1989), (Oliver, 1992). The reason of its generality lies in the use of a well defined underlying linguistic theory (distributionalism) (Harris, 1962), (Sager et al., 1981) and a scientifically based sublanguage approach (Grishman and Kittredge, 1986). Important for the present discussion is the semantic selection level of the LSP-MLP. All the words in the LSP dictionary are characterised by labels that indicate to which sublanguage word class(es) the words belong (e.g., H-TTCHIR: &amp;quot;contains general and specific surgical treatment or procedure words which imply or denote surgical intervention by the physician&amp;quot; (Sager et al., 1987, p.268); H-TXPROC: &amp;quot;contains medical test words designating procedures performed on the patient and not on a pati</context>

With respect to the morphological level, there is a full form dictionary stored in the relational database format (currently some 100.000 full forms that are mostly non-compound wordforms) (Dehaspe, 1993). If necessary, a recogniser characterises the unknown word forms morphologically (Spyns, 1994). Subsequently, a contextual disambiguation component tries to reduce the number of morphological readings (Spyns, 1995). As the syntactic level uses a &amp;quot;logic variant&amp;quot; of the LSP grammar formalism (Hirschman and Dowding, 1990), the Dutch morpho-syntactic module (Spyns and Adriaens, 1992) can replace the LSP parser. Many of the LSP-MLP medical co-occurrence patterns are practically identical for English, French and German, so that the application of these patterns to Dutch parse trees can lead to interesting results, namely the feasibility of reusing the non language specific parts of the LSP-MLP for Dutch medical NLP (Spyns, 1996a). 2.3 The DMLP/LSP-MLP connection The linguistic data are passed on from the DMLP to the LSP-MLP system via syntactic parse trees.

Consider the sentence 63 &amp;quot;operatieve procedure: vijfvoudige coronaire bypass.&amp;quot; 1 displayed in figure 4. The word &amp;quot;procedure&amp;quot; is semantically ambiguous because it has two semantic labels: H-TTCHIR &amp; H-TXPROC. Thanks to the co-occurrence patterns for the medical sublanguage, only the label that is valid in this context (H-TTCHIR) is ultimately selected. In another context (e.g.: test procedure: ...), another co-occurrence pattern will apply and select the H-TXPROC reading.

Consider the sentence 63 &amp;quot;operatieve procedure: vijfvoudige coronaire bypass.&amp;quot; 1 displayed in figure 4. The word &amp;quot;procedure&amp;quot; is semantically ambiguous because it has two semantic labels: H-TTCHIR &amp; H-TXPROC. Thanks to the co-occurrence patterns for the medical sublanguage, only the label that is valid in this context (H-TTCHIR) is ultimately selected. In another context (e.g.: test procedure: ...), another co-occurrence pattern will apply and select the H-TXPROC reading. Other examples of resolution of word sense ambiguities by means of co-occurrence patterns can be found in (Sager et al., 1987, pp.83, 95). The very latest work includes the use of Standard Generalized Mark-up Language (SGML) and World Wide Web (WWW) Graphical User Interface (GUI) technology to access and visualise better the requested information in the text (Sager et al., 1996).

The DTDs can act as a locally defined view (GUI aspect) on common SGML data (NLP aspect). Other potential applications in the medical domain for the DMLP/LSP-MLP combination are e.g., the determination of patient profiles (Borst et al., 1991), quality assurance (Lyman et al., 1991) and extraction of sign/syptom information for medication (Lyman et al., 1985). Overviews of the possible utilisation in the healthcare area of NLP based systems, irrespective of their theoretical background, can be found in (Baud et al., 1992b) &amp; (Sager et al., 1987, chapter2). But before any application of such an extent can be envisaged for Dutch, the words of the dictionary database all have to receive the appropriate semantic label(s). Luckily, this process can be automated. The LSP-team has implemented such routines (Hirschman et al., 1975) but other techniques could be applied as well (see (Habert et al., 1996)). From a technical point of view, it would be better to group all the involved software modules (NLP, RDBMS, WWW) on the same platform to optimally exploit the potentialities offered by the combination of the components mentioned.

While numerical data can be stored and processed (relatively) easily, free text is rather difficult to process by a computer, although in many cases it contains the most relevant information. The use of natural language does not facilitate the automation of. these tasks and hinders access to the wealth of medical information. However, natural language still is the most frequently used and easiest way to transmit complex messages (Scherrer et al., 1989). Hence, some authors consider the study and application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in Medicine (Scherrer et: al., 1989), (McCray- et al.. 1995), (Chute, 1997) as one of the most challenging issues in the field of medical information retrieval (Baud et al., 1992a), (Friedman and Johnson, 1992). Up till now, not many NLP-driven systems have actually been implemented (Spyns, 1996b). A concise overview of NLP-based information retrieval techniques for clinical narrative can be found in (Hersh, 1996, chapter 11, pp. 211-323).

This is due to the fact that the selection module takes syntactic relationships into account during the semantic disambiguating phase. The linguistic information of the DMLP and the LSP-MLP systems correspond in a high degree. Semantic word class labels, which were originally not foreseen in the Dutch lexicon, had to be added. A parse tree transducer delivers nearly genuine Dutch LSP-MLP trees (Spyns, 1996a). Although on the side of the LSP-MLP some new sublanguage semantic co-occurrence patterns had to be defined, the co-occurrence patterns are highly language independent. This was in line with results earlier achieved. An example (see figure 1) shows the output of the parse tree transducer that reshapes the DMLP tree into the required LSP-MLP format. The current state of the transducer allows to transform nearly all the parse trees. 2.4 The WWW interface The basic idea was that when treating a patient, it is considered to be helpful to reread the admission history, the discharge summary, or o</context>

However, natural language still is the most frequently used and easiest way to transmit complex messages (Scherrer et al., 1989). Hence, some authors consider the study and application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in Medicine (Scherrer et: al., 1989), (McCray- et al.. 1995), (Chute, 1997) as one of the most challenging issues in the field of medical information retrieval (Baud et al., 1992a), (Friedman and Johnson, 1992). Up till now, not many NLP-driven systems have actually been implemented (Spyns, 1996b). A concise overview of NLP-based information retrieval techniques for clinical narrative can be found in (Hersh, 1996, chapter 11, pp. 211-323). A possible environment for (medical) information retrieval is the Medical Registration Department of a hospital, and more in particular the medical encoding service. Clinical data in free text format are replaced by a set of numerical codes that summarise the content of the entire document. In general, the patient discharge summary (PDS), being a synthesis of the patient stay, is used for the encoding and abstracting task instead of the entire medi</context>

With respect to the morphological level, there is a full form dictionary stored in the relational database format (currently some 100.000 full forms that are mostly non-compound wordforms) (Dehaspe, 1993). If necessary, a recogniser characterises the unknown word forms morphologically (Spyns, 1994). Subsequently, a contextual disambiguation component tries to reduce the number of morphological readings (Spyns, 1995). As the syntactic level uses a &amp;quot;logic variant&amp;quot; of the LSP grammar formalism (Hirschman and Dowding, 1990), the Dutch morpho-syntactic module (Spyns and Adriaens, 1992) can repl</context>

This is due to the fact that the selection module takes syntactic relationships into account during the semantic disambiguating phase. The linguistic information of the DMLP and the LSP-MLP systems correspond in a high degree. Semantic word class labels, which were originally not foreseen in the Dutch lexicon, had to be added. A parse tree transducer delivers nearly genuine Dutch LSP-MLP trees (Spyns, 1996a). Although on the side of the LSP-MLP some new sublanguage semantic co-occurrence patterns had to be defined, the co-occurrence patterns are highly language independent. This was in line with results earlier achieved. An example (see figure 1) shows the output of the parse tree transducer that reshapes the DMLP tree into the required LSP-MLP format. The current state of the transducer allows to transform nearly all the parse trees. 2.4 The WWW interface The basic idea was that when treating a patient, it is considered to be helpful to reread the admission history, the discharge summary, or o</context>

Specific SQL-queries can then return the ID-number of the sentence with the relevant information instead of the information itself. If the ID-number is added to the original document as a pseudo-HTML code, the same mechanism as mentioned above can be used to highlight the sentences containing the relevant information. Several variants on this base scheme can be thought of. Following the line of research of Sager (Sager et al., 1995a) and Wingert (Wingert et al., 1989), classification codes could already be generated automatically (see also (Lovis et al., 1995)) and presented on the screen next to the original text. But the human encoder would remain responsible for the ultimate selection of the exact codes. Another possibility is the creation of &amp;quot;views&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;masks&amp;quot;. HTML files can be generated with &amp;quot;hard coded&amp;quot; instructions to emphasise fixed combinations of semantic labels. Buttons in the menu-page allow to display very rapidly the selected view on the PDS. Several experiments for English have already been successfully carried out (?) on the use of &amp;quot;static</context>
