Automatic news categorization systems have pro-
duced high accuracy, consistency, and flexibility using
some natural language processing techniques. These
knowledge-based categorization methods are more pow-
erful and accurate than statistical techniques. However,
the phrasal pre-processing and pattern matching methods
that seem to work for categorization have the disadvan-
tage of requiring a fair amount of knowledge-encoding
by human beings. In addition, they work much better at
certain tasks, such as identifying major events in texts,
than at others, such as determining what sort of business
or product is involved in a news event.
Statistical methods for categorization, on the other
hand, are easy to implement and require little or no hu-
man customization. But they don&apos;t offer any of the ben-
efits of natural language processing, such as the ability to
identify relationships and enforce linguistic constraints.
Our approach has been to use statistics in the knowl-
edge acquisition component of a linguistic pattern-based
categorization system, using statistical methods, for ex-
ample, to associate words with industries and identify
phrases that information about businesses or products.
Instead of replacing knowledge-based methods with statis-
tics, statistical training replaces knowledge engineering.
This has resulted in high accuracy, shorter customiza-
tion time, and good prospects for the application of the
statistical methods to problems in lexical acquisition.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999874825396825">
Text categorization is an excellent application domain
for natural language processing systems. First, it is a
task in which NLP techniques have born fruit, producing
high accuracy along with other benefits [Hayes and We-
instein, 1990; Kuhns, 1990; Tong et al., 19861. Second, it
provides an easy way of measuring success, by comparing
system responses with &amp;quot;expert&amp;quot; category assignments.
Third, it is a ripe domain for exploring statistical meth-
ods for automated knowledge acquisition. Published
work on text categorization has focused on the first item
above, arguing convincingly for knowledge-based tech-
niques and their accuracy, but has not yet opened the
way for the investigation of category assignment as a
way of testing NLP methods or on the prospects for ac-
quisition. This work focuses on combining statistics and
NLP in a knowledge-based categorization system, using
statistics as way of augmenting hand-coded knowledge.
The context of this research is a commercially-
developed system [Rau and Jacobs, 19911 that automat-
ically assigns categories to news stories for &amp;quot;custom clip-
ping&amp;quot; and other markets. Like Construe/TIS [Hayes and
Weinstein, 19901, the work derives from, and coordinates
with, NLP efforts, but the system primarily uses a lexico-
semantic pattern matcher for categorization [Jacobs et
al., 19911. Categorization tasks vary greatly in difficulty,
but the recall and precision results produced in our tests
are similar to those reported by other systems, with cov-
erage of over 90% on topic assignment and performance
better than human indexers on most aspects of the task.
Figure 1 shows a typical example of a news story, with
associated human-assigned categories. Retrieval is per-
formed by matching a desired set of categories (termed
a query or profile) against those assigned in the text
database. Our system, known as NLDB, mimics these
category assignments, extracting company names [Rau,
1991], topics or subject indicators, industries, and others
(including, for example, stock exchanges and geographic
regions). The program also incorporates portions of the
SCISOR system [Jacobs and Rau, 19901, which can fill
certain other fields, such as the target and suitor of a
takeover.
This sort of system has a simple appeal: the &amp;quot;answers&amp;quot;
(the set of category assignments) are usually clear-cut,
yet they clearly require some detailed content analysis.
On the other hand, the technologies that could con-
tribute to this analysis are bafflingly complex, from dis-
course methods that distinguish topics from background
events to word sense techniques that help to distinguish,
for example, COMMUNICATIONS from BROADCASTING and
HEALTH CARE from PHARMACEUTICALS.
Figure 2 shows the complete list of industry and topic
assignments currently in use to categorize texts in the
NL DB system.
The development of this system has advanced the
state of the art in practical NLP by proving the util-
ity of statistical training methods on a knowledge-based
NLP task. Feeding in large volumes of texts with hu-
man answers has found new ways around old problem:
in knowledge acquisition. This paper explains the re-
lationship between problems in NLP and performanc(
in categorization and describes a statistical method foi
automatically creating lexico-semantic patterns for cat-
egorization.

2 Overall Results
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999951794871795">
Figure 3 summarizes the overall results of this experi-
ment, including the results of assigning topic categories
(the task generally reported in this sort of work) and in-
dustry categories with statistics only, natural language,
and the combination; and the overall effect of the com-
bined approach.
Recall here has essentially the same meaning as in
information retrieval; i.e. the percentage of human-
assigned categories that the system also produced. Pre-
cision is the percentage of system-assigned categories
that also appeared in the human indices. These statis-
tics make the dubious (and often incorrect) assumption
that the human-assigned categories are always correct.
In Figure 1, for example, NLDB included AEROSPACE on
the industry listâ€”This hurts precision because it is not
included on the human list.
The major achievement here is that the combination
of statistical analysis and natural language based cate-
gorization is considerably better than either alone. The
system uses statistical methods where they do better (i.e.
industries) and NLP where it does better (i.e. topics),
and shows that combined NLP and statistics can be bet-
ter than either technique alone within a particular task.
The results tend to understate the real impact of this
combination, in part because of the large differences in
difficulty among sets of categories, and in part because
of the portion of the human-assigned categories that are
incorrect. In analyzing sample texts where the human
categories differ from the automatically-assigned cate-
gories, we have found that the system tends to be cor-
rect about as often as the human indexer, with many
cases so difficult to judge that multiple independent as-
sessments differ. Since this means that the system recall
against the human is higher than human recall against
the system, the results indicate that the system&apos;s overall
performance is better than human performance. How-
ever, for the purpose of this experiment, we use these
results to compare different system configurations, and
not to illustrate an absolute measure of accuracy.

3 Categorization &amp; Natural Language
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999233428571428">
While it is easy to attain a certain level of accuracy in
text categorization using a single layer of techniques and
to combine all texts and all categories in evaluating the
results, this aggregation of results obscures many of the
real problems where NLP and categorization come to-
gether. Each type of category can highlight a different
set of NLP issues, and different texts reveal different pro-
cessing problems. For example, the problem of mistaking
a totally irrelevant text for a text of a particular category
is very different from the subtle task of distinguishing
texts about one category from another. Similarly, NLP
results in processing texts within a category are quite
different from results in assigning texts to categories, for
reasons that will be explained below.
The best way to evaluate NLP techniques, therefore,
is within the context of a more precise task than cate-
gorization in general, and as a complement to statistical
methods. Even in component tasks where pure statis-
tical methods tend to outperform pure NLP methods,
NLP can play an important role in improving results,
and statistics can play a role in improving NLP.

3.1 Word Weights for Industry Assignment
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.984757444444444">
For example, in the news categorization task described
earlier, natural language delivered the weakest perfor-
mance relative to statistics on the assignment of indus-
try categories. Performance on topic assignment was
generally much higher using natural language, and com-
pany name extraction and variation was handled using
a separate mechanism [Rau, 19911. The two most ob-
vious differences between topic assignment and industry
assignment are:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.869893428571428">
1. It is generally easy to determine where the topic of
a story is expressed, either in the first sentence or
by spotting certain words and phrases that are good
indicators, while the industries involved can appear
almost anywhere in a story,
2. The breadth of language that expresses topic is
much narrower than the breadth required to handle

<bodyText confidence="0.999096166666667">
the different industries; for example, it is quite easy
to identify texts dealing with bankruptcies, lawsuits,
and mergers using a few key words and phrases (vo-
cabularies of no more than 20 or 30 words per topic).
but a single industry can be indicated by any num-
ber of words or expressions, including names of spe-
cific customers, products, or devices.
For these reasons, statistics have the upper hand in
the identification of industries, and the first pass at thE
NL DB system used linguistic methods for topic assign-
ment and statistical methods for industries. This was
unsatisfying, because we quickly came across errors in
the results that might have been prevented using simplf
NLP methods, as well as places where the results could
have helped to augment or correct linguistic knowledge
The statistical methods, which will be described later
involve weighting individual words and phrases accord-
ing to their value in distinguishing industries. The mosi

obvious errors resulting from these methods were finding
a good indicator in the wrong place (either in irrelevant
text or in background text), and finding a good indica-
tor used in a different way. These errors pervade the re-
sults of statistical categorization, with the most obvious
problems coming when the results clearly derived from
the misinterpretation of individual words and phrases.
For example, the word brewing occurred 14 times in a
sample of about 11,000 news stories. In 9 out of those 14
cases, or 64%, the story was correctly categorized under
the industry BEVERAGES, which includes less than 1% of
the stories. By most any statistical metric, brewing is
a strong indicator for BEVERAGES (better, in fact, than
beer and beverages, although not quite as good as Pepsi).
However, the statistical categorization method failed, for
example, on the following text, incorrectly assigning the
text to BEVERAGES:
The issue first surfaced Monday when
Dawes complained there is a &amp;quot;black hole&amp;quot; of in-
formation about how Richards deposited state
money while the S&amp;L crisis was brewing 1.
The word gas is not quite as good an indicator as
brewingâ€”in 55% of occurrences it indicates PETROLEUM
PRODUCTS, and 11% of the time UTILITIES, with scat-
tered other interpretations. But gas is much more fre-
quent than brewing, occurring 835 times in the same
training sample where brewing occurred 14 times. So,
in terms of overall performance, knowing when gas is a
good indicator of an industry can make more of a differ-
ence. The problem is with texts such as the following:
Of 55 check-ups of the 17 patients, mild di-
arrhea was reported during 2 percent of check-
ups, nausea or vomiting in about 3 percent and
a moderate increase in intestinal gas in about
10 percent.
While the problem with brewing above can easily be
solved by using any simple method of filtering out ir-
relevant text (the sentence appears in the middle of a
story about a political campaign), this is not the case
with gas. The gas example, like many similar errors, ap-
pears in relevant text describing the health effects of bran
cereal, which could be correctly categorized as HEALTH
CARE and FOOD.
Note also that it is difficult to compensate for errors
in individual word weights by using combined statistical
weights for categorization. This point will be discussed
more in Section 5, but the main problem is that content
words like patients, nausea and check-ups simply don&apos;t
have enough information content to act as good discrim-
inators compared to gas.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999407">
3.2 Recall and Precision
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996864574074074">
While it is easy to spot places where statistics tend to
introduce erroneous categories, thus lowering precision
in examples such as brewing and gas above, it is harder
to understand why statistical methods also fail to pro-
duce enough information to assign a category, thus pro-
ducing low recall. Since the task of assigning industries
&apos;italics added
depends more on what businesses companies are in than
what an individual story is about, the information about
the industry is often localized, perhaps even in a single
mention of a company or product. For example, the
following is a typical, though difficult, story about an
executive change:
....James W. Nelson has been named vice
president-manufacturing and distribution for
the household products group at Lehn &amp; Fink
Products, maker of such well-known brands as
Lysol, Love My Carpet, Resolve, Chubs, Mop
&amp; Glo, Ogilvie, Minwax and Thompson&apos;s.
Lehn &amp; Fink Products, headquartered in
Montvale, is a leading international marketer
of household and do-it-yourself products.
The human categorizer assigned the story to the
categories of CONSUMER PRODUCTS and PERSONAL CARE
PRODUCTS, although the latter is probably an error.
While CONSUMER PRODUCTS is the strongest category in-
dicated statistically, from words such as household and
brands, it is still weakly indicated; in fact, it would be
difficult to get a statistical measure to admit CONSUMER
PRODUCTS without also including RETAIL, BEVERAGES,
BUILDING MATERIAL, and even TEXTILES, which are
loosely coupled with terms such as brands, do-it-yourself
and carpet. It is also quite difficult, because of the high
independent frequencies of the words, to identify house-
hold products as a collocation or combination that should
be considered.
The key to getting good recall and precision on texts
such as these is to consider the weights of the individual
words and phrases to determine what industries could
be involved, but to use the structure of the texts to
help determine where the industry information might
be. Phrases like X is a leading marketer of Y or X
is the maker of Y appear throughout news stories, and
are sure indicators of industry information, even though
they do not point to any particular industry. Linguistic
approaches probably won&apos;t help to guess that Love My
Carpet is a consumer product, but they can help to de-
termine that the industry discriminators lie in the text
following patterns such as X is the maker of Y. Statistics
can then guess the industries associated with Y.
The NLP method used in NLDB associates categories
with linguistic patterns. We will next describe the pat-
tern language, then explain how statistical methods can
automatically add simple patterns.

4 Lexico-Semantic Patterns
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998718">
In SCISOR [Jacobs and Rau, 1990], MUC [Jacobs et
aL, 1991; Krupka et al., 1991], and other applications,
we have found that lexically-driven pre-processing serves
as a complement to parsing and semantic interpretation,
both in identifying portions of relevant text and in mark-
ing the input text to make it easier to process. Our
lexico-semantic pattern rules are quite similar to those
in CONSTRUE/TIS [Hayes and Weinstein, 1990], asso-
ciating each pattern with an action rule that can ma-
nipulate text or activate or de-activate a category. This
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.99369">
181
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999428857142857">
type of knowledge structure has proven effective for topic
identification as well as other forms of pre-processing.
Because the pattern matcher is designed as an efficient
&amp;quot;trigger&amp;quot; mechanism and an aid in parsing, the patterns
are mostly simple combinations of lexical categories. The
patterns largely adopt the language of regular expres-
sions, including the following terms and operators:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9999634">
â€¢ Lexical features that can be tested in a pattern
â€¢ Logical combination of lexical feature testsâ€”OR,
AND , and NOT
â€¢ Wild cards
â€¢ Variable assignment (?X = )
â€¢ Grouping operatorsâ€” &lt;&gt; for grouping, fl for dis-
junctive grouping
â€¢ Repetitionâ€” * for 0 or more, + for 1 or more
â€¢ Rangeâ€” *N for 0 to N, +N for 1 to N
â€¢ Optional Constituentsâ€” {} for optional
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.986812142857143">
While this pattern language provides a tool for rec-
ognizing linguistic constructs, most patterns for cate-
gorization are simple lexical items, semantic categories,
or combinations. For example, the word root dividend
and the phrase holders of record are good indicators of a
DIVIDEND story.
Most topics have rules that include such sure-fire sin-
gle words and phrases, along with some more complex
patterns. For example, the following two rules help to
recognize stories about mergers and acquisitions:
(or tender merger) offer =&gt; C-TAKEOVER ;
;; Cl ... announced ... acquisition of ... C2
?C1={cname} * $announce-verb * $merger-verb
*5 [of with] $ ?C2={cname}
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.570151" genericHeader="method">
=&gt; (C-TAKEOVER (r-agent ?Cl) (r-target ?C2)) ;
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999836476190476">
In addition to helping to catch a broader range of con-
structs that indicate takeovers, the more complex pat-
terns like the second one above can make preliminary as-
signments of roles, which can greatly speed and aid pars-
ing in systems that perform both parsing and categoriza-
tion. The ability to construct and add these more sophis-
ticated patterns by hand is a major advantage, which ac-
counts for much of the benefit of knowledge-based meth-
ods over statistical means. However, the more simple
patterns are required, the more labor-intensive this pro-
cess can be, and the more manual tuning must be done
in order to get accurate results.
Statistical methods have the advantage of building
rules automatically from a training set. But, in order
to get the benefit of statistics, the methods used must
add knowledge in the same form as the knowledge-based
rules, and must produce a clear result that is accessible
for knowledge engineering. In other words, the statis-
tical methods themselves must be an aid rather than a
replacement for knowledge acquisition. The next section
describes how this is accomplished.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.915905" genericHeader="method">
5 Statistics and Acquisition
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99476703030303">
The strategies for statistical training described here all
use a &amp;quot;training&amp;quot; set of 11,500 news stories, including
about 3,000,000 words, with human-assigned categories
assigned to each story. The &amp;quot;test&amp;quot; set used was a
new sample of one day&apos;s news, or 700 stories including
200,000 words.
Many statistical methods in information retrieval use
probabilistic weights of individual terms [Salton and
McGill, 19831, where a term can be a single word, root,
or combination of words. The techniques we explored
include various weighting schemes, with the end goal be-
ing to use heavily-weighted terms as the building blocks
for patterns. A term can be weighted with respect to its
overall relevance, or with respect to its ability to deter-
mine a particular category. The &amp;quot;pure&amp;quot; statistical results
reported earlier summed the weights of all terms in a text
with respect to each industry category.
Automating the process of acquiring lexico-semantic
patterns poses a number of distinct problems. First,
there has to be some means of distinguishing where in-
dustry information might appear in a text. Second, sin-
gle words should be distinguished from phrases in certain
cases where the individual words might be misleading.
Third, the statistical methods must produce individual
actions, not weights that must be combined to derive the
final answer or answers. Fourth, there has to be some
good way of determining when the statistical results were
bound to introduce errors.
All of these requirements come together to assure that
the statistical methods can be used to improve existing
sets of pattern-action rules, that manual methods will
not counteract the results of acquisition, and that the
statistical and NLP methods can interact gracefully.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.980061">
5.1 Identifying Relevant Text
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998968764705882">
Many of the errors with statistical methods, especially
when single words and phrases are used for categoriza-
tion, come from unusual occurrences in background or
irrelevant texts, such as the brewing example earlier. A
similar case is the word Yankee which is an excellent in-
dicator of NUCLEAR ENERGY (because of the New Hamp-
shire Yankee Power Plant), except in an isolated cluster
of articles about George Steinbrenner, the owner of the
New York Yankees.
We tried two methods of correcting for such problems.
First, we noted that most industry information is con-
tained in the headline, first, and last paragraphs of texts,
and tested using only these paragraphs for categoriza-
tion. Second, we tried a simple filter to score how much
each paragraph was like a first or last paragraph, using
the following calculation for the relevance weight of a
term:
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.476717857142857">
1000d log2 b
Where b is number of occurrences of each term in the
first and last paragraphs of text, and d is the ratio ol
occurrences in these texts to all occurrences, minus a
constant.
The following are some of the noteworthy results ol
these tests:
</footnote>
<page confidence="0.993699">

â€¢ A separate relevance filter produced some improve-

precision, and a larger improvement, about 5 points,
when only &amp;quot;in-or-out&amp;quot; patterns were used. This was
above and beyond a comparable gain from consid-
ering only headline, first, and last paragraphs.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.998041083333333">
â€¢ Almost all combinations of looking at first, last, and
additional relevant paragraphs ended up with about
the same results. In other words, looking at only
paragraphs with high relevance scores that were also
at the beginning or end of a story produced about
the same results, combining recall and precision, as
looking at highly relevant paragraphs in addition to
the first and last paragraphs. We settled on using
only first and last paragraphs with relevant scores
because this simply minimizes the amount of text
that must be processed.
â€¢ Using only first and last paragraphs for training, as

<bodyText confidence="0.875249642857143">
well as categorizing, produced no improvement in
results. We think that this is because the improve-
ment from having a more accurate training sample
is neutralized by having less text to train on. This
suggests using a still larger training sample.
These tests showed that a simple relevance filter pro-
duced a consistent, small, advantage in accuracy over
using the whole text of each story. However, surpris-
ingly, it was hard to see any gain from considering the
middle parts of stories where those parts had high rel-
evance scores. This suggests that further work could
produce better indicators of relevance that get industry
information out of the middle parts without introducing
more extraneous categories.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999947">
5.2 Collocations and Names
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9992396875">
Statistical methods looking for sure-fire indicators must,
by their nature, consider overwhelming statistical evi-
dence even when these indicators are relatively infre-
quent. Unfortunately, even when a word or phrase cor-
relates with an industry 100% of the time in a sample,
this does not mean that it will be a sure indicator in a
new sample. This is especially a problem with proper
names and names of locations, but is also an issue with
words that occur frequently in collocations.
Treating words as individual indicators when they re-
ally are part of a name or collocation can hurt precision
by increasing the chance that the single word will appear
independently. It can also hurt recall, because the com-
bined evidence derived from a name or collocation can be
strong even when the individual words contribute little.
As evidence of the problem with proper names, the
words Flint (a city in Michigan where General Motors
produces cars and trucks), Donahue (the name of a pop-
ular daytime TV show), and Warner (a communications
conglomerate) are all good statistical indicators. In fact,
in the training sample of about a month&apos;s worth of news,
Donahue was an indicator of BROADCASTING 18 out of 18
times, making it a better indicator even than Pepsi. But
in the one-day test sample, Donahue occurred only once,
in a story about the president of Nike (the athletic shoe
company). Flint occurred in a story about an art display
in the Michigan town, and Warner as a name unrelated
to the communications company.
While accurate recognition of proper names is neces-
sary for good precision, it is also a requirement for recall.
A company may be involved in industries that are diffi-
cult to get from either the parts of the name or the sur-
rounding context. For example, household is a weak indi-
cator for CONSUMER PRODUCTS, but the company House-
hold International is in the INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS cat-
egory. Similarly, Digital Equipment is in a different in-
dustry from Digital Communications. Since these names
are so important for industry assignment, we found that
the best results came from handling all proper names
separately and being much more lenient about when to
admit an industry name based on the name of a company
than for individual words and phrases.
With other compounds, there were again problems
with both recall and precision. Recall problems came
from common words that have a special meaning when
conjoined, such as real estateâ€”both real and estate fre-
quently occur, and have no significance with respect to
industry, but real estate is a good indicator of the REAL
ESTATE category. Television is a weak indicator of several
industry categories, but television viewers and television
networks are strong indicators.
We took a simple approach to handling such col-
locations, by computing mutual information statistics
[Church et a/., 1989] for bigrams (two-word sequences)
in the training corpus, and treating combinations with
a high degree of mutual information as if they were sin-
gle terms. So real estate would be treated as an atom,
the individual words not being considered for catego-
rization. This yielded fair results, but probably is not as
good a method as looking for discriminators specifically
when the individual words are indicators of multiple cat-
egories.
The following are some of the key results from separate
processing of names and collocations:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.897297058823529">
â€¢ Company name extraction was the best contribu-
tor to accuracy, with a 10% improvement in re-
call and no significant loss of precision over treat-
ing company names as any other word. This is an
especially compelling result because the individual
components of company names are often themselves
good indicators, and because the size of the train-
ing set is not nearly large enough to cover many
of the companies that occur in a given test (hence
the training data inherently miss a fair number of
companies).
â€¢ The use of bigrams yielded about a 6% gain in pre-
cision with no real effect on recall. We expect that
the number of bigrams was not adequate to have a
major positive impact on recall, while the method of
ignoring the individual component words can neu-
tralize some of the positive effect.

Knowledge-based methods aim at high-accuracy individ-
ual patterns. It is hard to balance these against weighted
terms, so it is best to tune the statistics to identify sim-
ple indicators rather than weights to be combined with
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999993131578948">
other weights. This way, a rule can combine hand-coded
knowledge with automatically-acquired data by looking
for industry information in a particular place and get-
ting the industry from a single indicator in that place,
as in the company manufactures satellites.
Because work in information retrieval [Salton and
McGill, 19831 has suggested that combinations of
weighted terms could be more accurate than single in-
or-out assignments, we compared a number of different
weighting methods with a number of different methods
for discriminating key indicators. We found that, in gen-
eral, the combination of weighted terms produced better
results than simply taking the union of the industries
activated by the &amp;quot;best&amp;quot; terms. However, the results for
the best discrete assignment of industries to individual
terms were very close to those of the weighted terms, and
the benefits of this approachâ€”including the ability to
integrate statistics with knowledge-based methods, the
identification of important ambiguities in word mean-
ing, and speed and simplicityâ€”suggest that statistical
thresholds for individual terms, without any combining
of weights, is a good approach.
We had to devise a statistical means of distinguish-
ing only those terms that were very good indicators by
themselves of a particular category, without having to
compute a score for each paragraph. This would not
have worked without the pre-processing of relevant text,
name and collocation extraction. In fact, the perfor-
mance of categorization using single in-or-out terms was
more than 10% lower in precision than the combina-
tion of weights without the pre-processing, but about
the same with the combined method. The apparent ex-
planation for this is that most of the error introduced
in using single terms as discriminators comes from the
confusion of terms either in special combinations or in
irrelevant text.
The following is the formula for weighting terms that
are individual indicators of a particular category:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.904597">
(200d)(log2 b)(log2 r)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999987272727273">
where b is number of times a term appears is a story
about a particular category, d is the difference between
that number and the overall percentage of words in texts
of that category, and r is the ratio of combined proba-
bilities to the product of independent probabilities, the
mutual information statistic.
With a threshold of 100, this weight identifies terms
that are good independent indicators of each topic.
These terms can then be used automatically, either by
themselves or in combination with other terms, to create
patterns in the knowledge base.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.985864">
5.4 Combining Information
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.985433838709678">
The statistical pre-processing methods and calculations
of relevance weights and weights for category indicators
lay the groundwork for automatically constructing lin-
guistic patterns for categorization. Because these indi-
vidual discriminators can be combined with hand-coded
knowledge, the statistical recognition of these terms is
sufficient to augment a knowledge base automatically,
and the combination of the hand-coded rules with the
statistical patterns is better than either alone (although
it could always be argued that, with a little more work,
the same rules could have been hand-coded).
These results are not completely satisfying. The sta-
tistical acquisition method uses only a fraction of the
power of the pattern language, and the error rate of the
system could still be reduced. We tried three different
types of methods-finding exceptions, co-indicators, and
meta-indicators-to try to improve results using combina-
tions rather than single term rules. These three methods
are described as follows:
Exceptions: Exceptions spot secondary terms that
would override a category indicated by a &amp;quot;good&amp;quot;
term, for example, if oil appears in a text about
the automobile industry rather than petroleum, it
might appear near motor or engine.
Co-indicators: Co-indicators spot combinations of
words, where at least one was a &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; term, where
the combination was a much better indicator that
the single term.
Meta-indicators: Meta-indicators spot terms such as
produces and manufactures, which are not them-
selves indicators of a particular industry, but often
appear near terms that indicate an industry.
For this process, we compiled a set of tables cover-
ing, for each good discriminator, the words that ap-
peared as neighbors of that term along with the num-
ber of times those words appeared in texts about the
&amp;quot;right&amp;quot; category vs. texts not about the category. This
was a computation-intensive process for 3 million words,
so much so that we had to reduce the size of the table
by considering only terms with moderate frequencyâ€”the
highest frequency terms are &amp;quot;stop&amp;quot; words, and the lowest
frequency terms are not good discriminators.
The following are the major results of this analysis:
â€¢ Using exception lists to try to correct for precision
problems turned out to be of surprisingly little value
(about 2% precision). While it is possible that dif-
ferent methods would yield better results, it seems
that the data on exceptions are just too sparseâ€”it
is much easier to get good data on positive examples
from the training set than negative examples.
â€¢ Using co-indicators, or second order relations, ap-
peared to be much more promising than exceptions.
Like the use of bigrams, this produced only a small
effect (about 2% in both recall and precision), but
any technique that improves recall without a loss of
precision is worth exploring.
â€¢ The use of meta-indicators, while also not produc-
ing a major effect on results, looks like the most
promising method. Like co-indicators, these meta-
indicators rely mainly on positive examples from the
text, but they have the additional advantage of be-
ing able to use much larger volumes of data.

6 Fertile Areas for Future Research

<bodyText confidence="0.999984916666667">
of this evaluation is the prospect for new areas where
statistics can help natural language and vice versa. We
have identified three critical research areas that are likely
to improve both system performance and general NLP
performance.
The first major area of research is in discourse, or text
structure analysis. This experiment showed that the first
and last paragraphs of a news story give much more accu-
rate information than others, and that a general assess-
ment of relevance of a paragraph serves as a good filter
for the extraction of information from that paragraph.
However, this simple filter falls far short of really identi-
fying where the information in a story lies. For example,
in many stories the &amp;quot;last&amp;quot; paragraph really comes in the
middle of a text, with some additional material coming
at the end because of incidental information or strange
editing. Similarly, in more complicated texts, there can
be more than one introductory paragraph, multiple con-
cluding paragraphs, and other critical information in the
middle. Statistical techniques are a very weak means of
guessing this type of structural information. We expect
that we can improve the results slightly with some more
sophisticated discourse analysis; and, perhaps more im-
portantly, this type of evaluation can measure how well
a structural theory of text can perform.
The second area to explore is developing generalized
patterns from detailed statistical analysis. The first-
order logarithmic measures used for acquisition here are
overly simplistic, and assume that relationships between
words and categories are basically independent. This as-
sumption is false, because the words are a manifestation
of concepts and linguistic relations in the text that the
statistics are ignoring. We are investigating a variety
of more complex means, including multivariate discrimi-
nant analysis, that help to determine when, for example,
the effect of combining satellite with weapon is really an
effect of combining satellite with any military concept.
The third, more linguistic, area is in identifying the-
matic roles. In meta-indicators described earlier, we are
really identifying potential function words in the text,
such as produces or manufactures. Since the use of these
terms in category assignment really assumes that any
company or industry appearing around them is involved
in the function or operation, it should be possible to use
more detailed parsing to check whether this assumption
fits linguistically, and to use the statistical analysis to
acquire functional or thematic relations that can help in
more detailed analysis.

7 Summary and Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9992575">
This paper has addressed the area where statistical and
linguistic analysis come together with an application
focus â€” the assignment of categories to news stories,
particularly the identification of topics and industries.
The experiments reported here show that using statis-
tical methods to acquire simple lexical patterns helps
knowledge-based processing and leads to a substantial
improvement in overall system performance. In addition,
this method promises to ease the burden of hand-coding
knowledge for each application, by automatically identi-
fying the significant terms and combinations of terms to
use knowledge-intensive NLP applications.

<abstract confidence="0.998640740740741">Automatic news categorization systems have produced high accuracy, consistency, and flexibility using some natural language processing techniques. These knowledge-based categorization methods are more powerful and accurate than statistical techniques. However, the phrasal pre-processing and pattern matching methods that seem to work for categorization have the disadvantage of requiring a fair amount of knowledge-encoding by human beings. In addition, they work much better at certain tasks, such as identifying major events in texts, than at others, such as determining what sort of business or product is involved in a news event. Statistical methods for categorization, on the other hand, are easy to implement and require little or no human customization. But they don&apos;t offer any of the benefits of natural language processing, such as the ability to identify relationships and enforce linguistic constraints. Our approach has been to use statistics in the knowledge acquisition component of a linguistic pattern-based categorization system, using statistical methods, for example, to associate words with industries and identify phrases that information about businesses or products. Instead of replacing knowledge-based methods with statistics, statistical training replaces knowledge engineering. This has resulted in high accuracy, shorter customization time, and good prospects for the application of the statistical methods to problems in lexical acquisition.</abstract>
