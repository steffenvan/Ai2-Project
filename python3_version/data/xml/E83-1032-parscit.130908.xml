Presented paper contains a descrip-
tion of an experimental version of the
natural language information retrieval
system DIALOG. The system is destined
for the use in the field of medicine.
Its main purpose is to ensure access to
information to phisicians in a conver-
sational manner. The use of the system
does not require ability of programming
from its user.
1.. Introduction
The paper presents the state of
elaboration of the natural language in-
formation retrieval system DIALOG. Its
aim is an automatic, conversational ex-
traction of facts froM a given text.
Actually it is real medical text on
gastroenterology, which was prepared by
a team of specialists. The system has
a modular structure.
The first, and in fact very import-
ant module is the language analysis mod-
ule. Its task is to ensure the transi-
tion of a medical text from its natural
form, i.e. sentences formed by phys-
icians, into a formal logical notation.
This logical notation, i.e. logical for-
mulae, is rather universal and can be
easy adapted to various deductive and
knowledge representation methods. The
program of the analyser was written with
the use of the CATN /Cascaded ATN/ tech-
nique, where the syntactic and semantic
components constitute separate cascades.
In the deduction and knowledge rep-
resentation module the weak second order
language was used. The works by E.Konrad
/Konrad 76/ and N.Klein /Klein 78/ from
the Technical University in Berlin were

the starting point in the elaboration of
this module.
Presented version of the system was
implemented on the IBM 370 computer /VM
370 operating system/.
2. Transformation of natural language
sentences into logical formulae
The user of the DIALOG system intro-
ducing his utterance into the system
comes into direct contact with the natu-
ral language analysis module. This mod-
ule plays the key role in the machine
natural language communication process.
Similarly as in many other information
systems of this type, e.g. LUNAR /Woods
72/, PLANES /Waltz 76/, SOPHIE /Burton
76/, RENDEZ-VOUS /Codd 78/, PLIDIS
/Berry-Rogghe 78/, DIALOGIC /Grosz et al.
82/, the purpose of the module is to
transform a text in the natural language
into a chosen formal representation. Suet
Such a representationmust meet a number
of requirements. Firstly, it must be
&amp;quot;intelligible&amp;quot; to the internal parts of
the system, i.e. the deductive component
and/or managing the data base. Secondly,
it must carry in a formal and clear man-
er the sense and meaning of utterances
in natural language. Finally, the repre-
sentation should allow for a reproduc-
tion of the original input sentence with
the aim of generating intermediate para-
phrases and/or answers for the user.
In the parser of the DIALOG system,
we attempted on the gratest, in our
opinion, achievements in the field of
natural language processing. The follow-
ing works had the greatest influence on
the final form of the module: /Berry-
-Rogghe 78/, /Bates 78/, /Carbonell 81/,
/Cercone 80/, /Chomsky 65/, /Ferrari
80/, /Fillmore 68/, /Gershman 79/,
/Grosz 82/, /Lruldsbergen 81/, /Marcus
80/, /Martin 81/, /Moore 81/, /Robinson
82/, /Rosenschein 82/ /Schenk 78/,
/Steinacker 82/, /Waltz 78/, /Wilensky
80/, /Woods 72/ and /Woods 80/. We have
transferred, with greater or less suc-
cess, the most valuable achievements
presented in these works, pertaining
</bodyText>

mainly to the English language process-
ing, into our system, using them in the
treatment of the Polish language. We
attempted thus, to preserve a certain
distance with regard to the language it-
self, as well as the subject of conver-
sation with the computer, so that the
adapted solutions were of a broader
character and through that became com-
parable with the state of research in
that field in other countries.
2.1. &apos;The role, place and structure of
the language analysis module
The purpose of the language analy-
sis module in the DIALOG system is tran-
sformation of the user Th utterance /in
Polish/ into the I order logic formulae.
Other formal notations such as II order
logic formulae, FUZZY formulae, Minsky
frames and even the introduction of
intensional logic elements are also con-
sidered. At present, we will conoentrate
on the process of transforming a natural
sentence into a I order logic formula.
The system is equipped with two
independent modules: deduction and data
base management. The data for these mod-
ules are the formulae generated by the
parser. We will present only one module
working on the basis of the weak second
order logic.
The parsing system consists of the
two closely cooperating parts: a syntac-
tic analyser and a semantic interpreter.
The whole was programmed with the aid of
a mechanism called CATN /Cascaded ATN/
/Woods 80/, /Bole, Strzalkowski 82a,82b/
/Kochut 83/, where the syntactic compo-
nent plays the role of the &amp;quot;upper&amp;quot;, i.e.
the dominating &amp;quot;cascade&amp;quot;. For the syn-
tactic analyser produces a structure of
the sentence grammatical analysis, which
in turn undergoes a semantical verifica-
tion. In case, where the semantic inter-
preter is not able to give the meaning
of the sentence, the syntactic component
is activated again with the aim of pre-
senting another grammatical analysis. If
such an analysis cannot be found, the
input sentence is treated as incorrect.
2.2. The syntactic analyser
The syntactic component of the par-
ser produces a grammatical analysis of
the input sentence in Polish. This was
possible due to a skillful, programming
of rules governing the morphology and
syntax of the language. Although, the
whole system was oriented towards a de-
fined type of texts /medical/, the ac-
cepted solutions make it a much more
universal tool. We do not claim that the
syntactic analyser in its present form
is able to solve all or the majority of
problems of the Polish language syntax.
It includes, however, rather wide subset
of the colloquial language, enriched by
constructions characteristic for medical
texts.
A natural language sentence intro-
duced into the parser undergoes firstly
a pretreatment in a so called spelling
corrector. If all the words used in the
sentence are listed in the system vocabu-
lary then the sentence is passed for syn-
tactic analysis. Otherwise the system
attempts to state whether the speaker
made a spelling error, giving him a
chance to correct the error and even
suggesting the proper word, or whether he
used a word unknown to the system. In the
last case, the user has a possibility of
introducing the questioned word into the
vocabulary but in practice it may turn
out to be too troublesome for him. Usual-
ly then, the user is given a chance of
withdrawing the unfortunate utterance or
formulating it in a different way.
The proper syntactic analysis begins
at the moment of activating the first
&amp;quot;cascade&amp;quot; of the parser. It consists of
five ATN nets, with the aid of which the
grammar of the subset of the Polish lan-
guage has been written. The two largest
nets SENTENCE /sentences/ and NOUN-PMR
/nominal groups/ play a superiorrole in
relation to others: ADH-PHRA /adjective
groups/, ADV-PHRA /adverb groups/ and
Q-EXPR /question phrases/. The process of
syntactic analysis is usually quite com-
plex and uses essentially the non-deter-
ministic character of processing in ATM.
It is justified by the specific nature
of the Polish language, which is charac-
terised by a developed inflection and a
Sentence free word order.
The result of the syntactic analysis
is a grammatical analysis of the input
sentence in the form of a so called
0-form. It is a nonflexional form of
a sentence, ordered according to a fixed
key. The construction of the o-form can
be expressed ba the structure:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.787443166666667">
&lt;o-form&gt;
(S &lt;questions&gt; I &lt;negation &lt;modalitie&gt;
l&lt;predicate/verb)I (vague&gt;I&lt;subject) I
(direct object&gt; 1 &lt;Indirect object)! 4
Ore. phrase)InCAUSE/RESITLTO-form,&gt;1
END)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.997963166666667">
The stick. mark &amp;quot;I&amp;quot; is usually used as a
symbol of the meta-language. Here it is
used as a symbol of the defined language.
Symbols S and END comprise a single
clause. A clause expresses every elemen-
tary activity or event expressed in the
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.990464">
197
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.994291049180328">
input sentence. Often, the o-form has
a richer structure than a classical
analysis tree. The elements of the
o-form called &lt;subject&gt; , &lt;direct ob-
ject&gt;, &lt;indirect object&gt;, and &lt;adject-
ive phrase&gt; can also be expressed or
modified with the use of clauses. The
stick marks &amp;quot;I&amp;quot; separate the parts of
the o-form and are its constatnt ele-
ments. Then transformed question is
subjected to semantic interpretation.
The syntactic analyser manages the
vocabulary, where inflexional forms of
words are kept. The vocabulary defini-
tion specifies the syntactic categories,
to which given words belong. It also
describes forms of words with the aid of
lexicalparameters: case, number, person
and gender. These parameters are of gret
value in examining the grammatical con-
struction of sentences.
2.3. The semantic internreter
When the syntactic analysis is suc-
cessfully completed the o-form of the
input dentence is forwarded for the sem-
antic interpretation. The syntactic
&amp;quot;cascade&amp;quot; is suspended, i.e. removed
from the operational field, leaving
place for the semantic &amp;quot;cascade&amp;quot;. The
configuration of the removed &amp;quot;cascade&amp;quot;
is remembered thus in case of necessity
of generating an alternntive grammatical
analysis.
The semantic interpreter consists
of the two main parts: a constant con-
trolling part, working on the basis of
a very general pattern adjustment, and
compatible experts algorithms, where
the knowledge of the system in the field
of conversation has been coded. The pro-
cess of interpretation is assisted by
a special vocabulary of semantic rules
and on additional vocabulary complement-
ing the expert knowledge.
The sentence in the o-form is for-
warded directly to the controlling part
of the interpreter, where such its par-
ameters as time, negation, aspect ....
are evaluated first. Then the central
predicative element of the sentence
&amp;quot;calls for&amp;quot; a proper semantic rule,
which from then will guide the interpre-
tation process. The rule has a form of
a pattern-concept pair /Wilensky 80/ ,
/Gershman 79/, /Carbonell 81/, where the
pattern reflects the scheme of an ele-
mentary event, wheras the concept indi-
cates how its meaning should be express-
ed through formulae. The semantic rule
is activated for the time of interpre-
tation of a single clause. If the pat
tern is adjusted to the clause, an
atomic formula is generated, expressing
the meaning of the clause. The meaning
of the whole sentence is expressed as
a logical combination of meanings of all
the o-form clauses. The semantic rules
bring different /on the surface/ descrip-
tions of the same phenomenon into a com-
mon interpretation.
The &apos;general structure of formulae
generated by the interpreter is ex-
pressed by an implication:
al A C4 2 A
&apos;wheref has been introduced from a sem-
antic rule and44i come from the system
knowledge - special compatible parts
of the interpreter called the experts.
Individual o-form phrases, in the con-
text of the dialogue subject, are inter-
preted in experts.
In our system, designed for conver-
sation with a phisiaian, we have experts
for names of sicknesses /SICKNESS/,
names of organs /ORGAN/, internal sub-
stances /SUBSTANCE/, therapies /TREAT-
MENT&apos;, medicaments /MEDICAMENT/ and
names of animate objects /ANIMATE/ and
the remaining objects foreign to the
body /PHYSOBJ/. Experts are activated
on the request of a proper semantic rule.
The controlling part of the interpeter
&amp;quot;instructs&amp;quot; the expert/s/ chosen by the
pattern to interpret a notion or expres-
sion. The indicated expert can solve the
problem on its own or seek for the help
of other experts. Often, one complex ex-
pression has to be qualified by two or
three exprrts.
All the experts, as well as the
controlling part of the interpreter
/FORMULA, CASES and QWORDS nets/ have
been recoreded in ATN formalism and form
a lower &amp;quot;cascade&amp;quot; of the parser.
The interpreter is also equipped
with a mechanism of context pronominal
reference solution.
2.4. Examples of transformation of a
medical text into logical formulae
We will present two eyamples of
transformation of medical sentences into
I order logic formulae. Before that,
a few words on the adopted convention of
formula notation. The symbols IMPLSYM
and KONJSYM are logical operators
/implication/ and ca,/ /conjunction/ re-
spectively. Integer p&apos;_aced directly
after the symbol KONJSYM indicates the
number of conjunction factors. Names of
predicates are preceded by symbols 4t&amp;quot;
/hash mark/, and an integer placed right
to the name defines the number of predi-

cate arguments. The arguments specify
their type /sort/, name of the variable
and constant /if there is one/.

3. The deduction and knowledge repre-
sentation module
The deduction module is a separate
part of the whole DIALOG system. Its mair
purpose is to collect and represent the
knowledge gained by the system and also
the ability to use the possessed infor-
mation in accordance with the wishes of
the user of the system.
Our work on the achievement of the
objectives indicated above was based on
the experiences prerented by E.Konrad
and N.Klein /Konrad 76/, /Klein 78/ from
Technical University in West Berlin.
In the previous chapter we present-
ed how the text, written in Polish, is
transformed into I order logic formulae.
This, of course, implies the way of rep-
resentation of the knowledge presented
in the natural language.
</bodyText>

3.1. Knowledge representation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994635235294118">
The information included in the
logical formulae coming from the lan-
guage module has to be stored for later
use. The logical formulae are then in-
troduced into the data base. The data
base, adequately filled with the men-
tioned formulae, constitutes the knowl-
edge representation carried through the
natural language sentences. It is as
equivalent to the text as the I order
logic allows to convey the meaning of the
natural language sentences.
Data Base
The date base consists of three sep-
arate parts: a nucleus, an amplifier and
a filter !Konrad 76/. Each of the parts
includes a different , from the concep-

<bodyText confidence="0.965627857142857">
tional point of view, elements:
A. The nucleus includes groud literals,
which represent facts occuring in the
field of knowledge represented in the
base. E.g.the information that the pan-
creas is a secretory organ is presented
as a literal
OWYDZ-NARZAD (TRZUSTYA))
From the system point of view there is
no conceptional difference between the
teo facts: the above one,and
(ORGAN (TRZUSTKA))
Thus the type /sort/ ORGAN may be re-
garded as a predicate and the above
atomic formula as true one. .
B. The amplifier is a part representing
the &amp;quot;fundamental&amp;quot; knowledge of the
system. The formulae included in the
amplifier can be devided into three cat-
egories:
1/ dependent formulae
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.717981">
/i/ yx1[52.:VxnCs] A rx x 1-4(xfrf.0 )

<bodyText confidence="0.7962658">
A is here any formula and n a predi-
cate. As we can see each variable,

<bodyText confidence="0.998036428571429">
The majority of the formulae generated
by the language analysis module is of
the /i/ form.
C. The filter contains the formulae
representing the knowledge necessary
to preserve the integrity of the data
base.

<bodyText confidence="0.99948497826087">
Recapitulating, the nucleus repre-
sents the extensional part of the know-
ledge represented in the data base. It
.is the fundamental knowledge which can-
not be obtained from the analysis of the
presented text, and which is essential
to proper deduction. The amplifier
represents the intensional part of the
data base. The knowledge represented
there is a collection of statements used
for deduction.
Each of the logical formulae is
kept in a certain internal form, corre-
sponding to the way of deduction, de-
scribed later on. As we have already
mentioned, the majority of formulae is
of the /i/ form. Every such formula is
converted, at the moment of inserting
into the data base, to a pair of the
following form:
(conclusion) premises testing procedurA
3.2. The knowledge extraction
Because of the menner of storing
the knowledge described in the point 3.1,
the answer to the question presented to
the system does not have to be represent-
ed explicite in the data base. The de-
duction module should be able to obtain
all the information included in the data
base.
The questions presented to the sys-
tem are also converted to the logical
formulae. Thus, the extraction of knowl-
edge is reduced to the verification of
a given formula towards the present con-
tent of the data base.
The logical formula representing
the question is converted to an appro-
priate LISP form. Evaluation of such
a form is equivalent to examination
whether the represented by it formula is
true. This form correspond to the normal
form of the logical formula /LISP func-
tion AND, OR and NOT are used/. The
literals are tested by a TESTE function
according to the following algorithm:

<listItem confidence="0.8039976">
1. Check the amplifier, trying to find
the rule with the conclusion unifi-
able with the literal under proof. If
such a formula does not exist that there
is no proof of a given literal;

a. if it is indicated as an indepen-
dent. formula then STOP with a proof
b. if it is indicated as a restrictive
formula then STOP without a proof;

<bodyText confidence="0.960947333333333">
c. otherwise evaluate the form asso-
ciated with the conclusion; if we

Otherwise Stop without a proof.
It is therefore a so called backward
deduction system. The proof goes back
from the formula - aim to the facts,
applying the formulae from the amplifier
in the &amp;quot;Backward&amp;quot; direction.
The answer can be YES or NO or it
can be a list of constants depending on
the kind of question.
The I order logic has been enriched
here with some elements of the II order
language. Predicate variables, quantifi-
cation of these variavles and retrieval
of predicates as well as constants have
been introduced.
3.3. Access to the data base
The system corn municates with the
data base through commands of the spe-
cially designed language. These commands
enable introduction and erasing from the
data base.
The basic commands serving the pur-
pose of knowledge extraction are TEST
and FIND:

4. Conclusion
The results obtained during the
work on the system confirmed our direc-
tion of research. Our further work will
concentrate on constant improvement of
the existing modules. At the same time
we will undertake attempts of enriching
the system with better deductive modules.
such as resolution in modal logic,
default reasoning /Reiter/, FUZZY and
Minsky frames.
