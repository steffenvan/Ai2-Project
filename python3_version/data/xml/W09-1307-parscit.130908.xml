Text mining for biomedicine requires a sig-
nificant amount of domain knowledge. Much
of this information is contained in biomedical
ontologies. Developers of text mining appli-
cations often look for appropriate ontologies
that can be integrated into their systems, rather
than develop new ontologies from scratch.
However, there is often a lack of documen-
tation of the qualities of the ontologies. A
number of methodologies for evaluating on-
tologies have been developed, but it is diffi-
cult for users by using these methods to se-
lect an ontology. In this paper, we propose
a framework for selecting the most appropri-
ate ontology for a particular text mining appli-
cation. The framework comprises three com-
ponents, each of which considers different as-
pects of requirements of text mining applica-
tions on ontologies. We also present an ex-
periment based on the framework choosing an
ontology for a gene normalization system.

With the explosive growth of the volume of pub-
lished biomedical research, it is challenging to keep
up to date with the underlying knowledge avail-
able in the form of free text. The necessity of un-
derstanding actions of individual biological compo-
nents in system context rather than in isolation, ex-
tends the coverage of literature far beyond the ca-
pabilities of individual scientists. Text mining is an
emerging field that attempts to deal with these chal-
lenges (Ananiadou and McHought, 2006; Cohen
and Hersh, 2005; Spasic et al., 2005). Text mining
requires a significant amount of domain knowledge.

A large number of biomedical ontologies already ex-
ist, and hold much of the information. Some of the
ontologies have been designed for modeling domain
knowledge, e.g. FMA (Rosse and Mejino, 2003) and
GO (Ashburner et al., 2000), others are developed
for potential applications, e.g. MeSH (Lowe and
Barnett, 1994) for indexing the medical literature.
Whatever purposes the ontologies were built for,
they are used to support text mining for tasks such as
access to text, natural language processing, and in-
formation integration. Developers of text mining ap-
plications often look for appropriate ontologies that
can be integrated into their systems, rather than de-
velop new ontologies from scratch. The choice of
ontology may, however, have a major impact on the
performance of the text mining system, including
the quality of the results.
Selecting an appropriate ontology relies on eval-
uation and comparison of the available ontologies.
Unfortunately, there is often a lack of documenta-
tion of the qualities of the ontologies. A number of
methodologies for evaluating ontologies have been
proposed, mainly for evaluating one ontology at a
time. However, it is difficult for users by using these
methods to make a decision on ontology selection.
The various evaluation methods can be classified
into three main categories: 1) Those that evaluate
ontologies against a set of criteria defined by hu-
man (e.g. (Lozano and G´omez, 2004) suggests 160
criteria). Most of the evaluation criteria are from
the point of view of ontology building. They are
not applicable for the selection of ontologies for a
particular application. 2) Those that include meth-
ods to gather statistics about the nature of ontolo-
gies (e.g. (Gangemi et al., 2006) proposes 32 mea-
sures for depth, width, fan-out, etc). The problem

for this kind of methods is that it is not clear how to
use these statistics for ontology selection among al-
ternatives. 3) Those that are application-dependent
evaluations. For example, ontologies are evaluated
against a corpus in (Brewster et al., 2004) regarding
the domain of an IE system, and (Porzel and Malaka,
2004) evaluates the quality of an ontology regard-
ing a relation tagging task by using gold standard
data tagged by human. While evaluating ontologies
for the particular application is a relatively straight-
forward method, evaluations may be sensitive to the
test dataset, and it may also be expensive to perform
evaluations for many ontologies.
In this paper we propose a framework for select-
ing the most appropriate ontology for a particular
text mining application. The framework comprises
three components for selection, and uses and ex-
tends some of existing ontology evaluation and val-
idation methods regarding the requirements of text
mining in the area. After a brief overview of the re-
lated work, we introduce our framework in section
3. In section 4 we show how to use the framework
in the setting of selecting an ontology for the gene
normalization system described in (Tan, 2008).

Not much work has been done yet for ontology se-
lection in the biomedical area. Bioportal (Biopor-
tal, 2.0) is an ontology library, currently mainly
for browsing and navigating biomedical ontologies.
The system also allows users of ontologies to submit
information about their applications and comments
on the content of ontologies, and stores mappings
between concepts of ontologies in the library. This
information may help users to select ontologies from
the repository.
Some work has been done for ontology selection
for the Semantic Web. In (Sabou et al., 2006), au-
thors indicate the challenges for ontology evalua-
tion posed by ontology selection for the Semantic
Web, such as the need for automation and good per-
formance. Two examples of ontology selection for
the Semantic Web are OntoSelect (Buitelaar et al.,
2004) and AKTiveRank (Alani and Brewster, 2005).
Both are mainly based on the second category of on-
tology evaluation methods. OntoSelect is an ontol-
ogy library that gives a functionality for selecting
ontologies for a given knowledge markup task. The
selection relies on measuring the number of con-
cepts and properties, and popularity of ontologies.
The ontology selection algorithm in AKTiveRank
combines the measures of coverage of an ontology
given search terms, and locations of the terms and
semantic similarity between the terms in the struc-
ture of the ontology.
OntoMetric is a hierarchical framework proposed
in (Lozano and G´omez, 2004) for general ontology
selection. The tool offers a default hierarchy of cri-
teria to evaluate ontologies from the point of view of
building ontologies, and also allows users to adapt it
for their needs. The selection is based on a weighted
addition of value of each criteria.

3 The Framework
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.980208862068965">
In principle biomedical ontologies provide formal
representations of domain knowledge for text min-
ing in the area, but they are used for different pur-
poses such as providing a model for storing, search-
ing and querying a repository of text; providing do-
main knowledge for natural language processing;
providing a framework for information integration;
or several of the above purposes.
Based on a literature study and experience in
building systems, in this section we suggest crite-
ria for selecting an ontology for a given biomedical
text mining application. The criteria are organized
in three components of a framework.
Component 1
In the first component the criteria for ontology selec-
tion are given in two dimensions: content and sup-
porting technologies. The combined requirements
from the two dimensions lead to a list of candidate
ontologies.
Content What are the requirements on the content
of ontology given an application? We propose three
characteristics to be considered,
- Type What is the kind of the ontology required
in the scenario? Ontologies can be distin-
guished into three basic types (Stenzhorn et al.,
2005): top ontologies, e.g. BFO (Smith, 2004),
contain only a restricted set of highly general
classes, such as Function and Object, which are
not tied to any particular domain of interest;
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.994373">
56
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.993836545454545">
top-domain ontologies, e.g. BioTop (Stenzhorn
et al., 2005), contain all classes that are essen-
tially needed to describe a certain domain, such
as Organism, Cell and Tissue in the case of bi-
ology; and domain ontologies, e.g. GO (Ash-
burner et al., 2000), contain classes that com-
prehensively describe a certain domain of in-
terest. For example, for natural language pro-
cessing tasks such as entity recognition, a top-
domain ontology may be sufficient.
- Scope What are the main subjects that need to
be covered in a top-domain or domain ontology
required by the application? For example, gene
and disease are the domains that concern (Hris-
tovski et al., 2005).
- Representation What kind of information needs
to be present in the ontology? From a knowl-
edge representation point of view, ontologies
can have the following components: concepts,
which represent sets or classes of entities in a
domain; relations between concepts, instances,
which represent the actual entities; and axioms,
which represent facts that are always true in
the topic area of the ontology (Lambrix et al.,
2007). Which components should be present
in the ontology, depends to some extent on the
purpose of the ontology in the application. For
example, if an ontology is used as resource for
NLP in the application, components concepts
and instances both may be necessary, but not
relations and axioms.
Supporting technologies Three questions are con-
sidered in this dimension:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.896447933333333">
1. What technologies are needed to support the
use of the ontology in the scenario? Support-
ing technologies may include ontology repre-
sentation languages, ontology browsers, tools
for ontology alignment, reasoning services, and
ontology-driven NLP tools.
2. Are tools available to provide the supporting
technologies for the ontology? For example,
ontology alignment systems, e.g. (Lambrix and
Tan, 2008) are available for biomedical ontolo-
gies in OWL and OBO format.
3. What is the cost to develop new tools to support
the use of an ontology if there is no existing
tools? Does the cost meet the expectations of
the application?
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.987127368421053">
Component 2
In this level the criteria for selection focus on de-
tailed content of candidate ontologies which are con-
sidered in two aspects: verification and evaluation.
Verification Considering the maturity level of cur-
rent biomedical ontologies, verification of taxo-
nomic knowledge in candidate ontologies is valu-
able for selection. Reasoners, such as Racer, Pellet,
and FaCT++, can check consistency, incompleteness
and redundancy in ontologies.
Evaluation First, we list a set of characteristics of
ontologies that are of interest for text mining appli-
cations,
- Coverage Does an ontology cover the concepts
or/and relations concerned in the application?
Do their definitions meet the expected scope?
- Taxonomic Knowledge The two relations is-a
and part-of have a central role in almost all on-
tologies (Smith et al., 2005). Do the locations
of essential concepts in the is-a and part-of hi-
erarchies meet the expectation?
- Instance The instantiation of concepts and the
number of instances for each concept could ef-
fect greatly the performance of many text min-
ing tasks such as entity recognition. Do they
satisfy the requirements?
These characteristics may be evaluated,
- against domain experts or references if they ex-
ist. For example, if an ontology involves inte-
gration of literature with data from biological
databases, schemas of databases can be the ref-
erences.
- among candidate ontologies. There is no gold
standard in this situation and therefore the can-
didate ontologies are compared directly to each
other. For instance, aligning the ontologies can
provide information about their similarities and
differences regarding their coverage.

Component 3
The results from component 1 and 2 may not lead to
a direct and confident decision. Also, in many cases
there exist gold standards or benchmarks which we
can use to evaluate our application. Therefore, the
purpose of component 3 is to evaluate the use of on-
tologies in a real system. This component could pro-
vide a relatively straightforward method for evaluat-
ing the quality of ontologies for use in the applica-
tion.
The field of biomedical text mining has ex-
pended considerable effort in building evaluation re-
sources. A number of challenges, such as TREC Ge-
nomics track, BioCreative, BioNLP/JNLPBA 2004
and LLL05, have been organized in the community.
They contribute to the creation of shared gold stan-
dard datasets, prepared by domain experts and also
suggest evaluation measures. Comparison of the
system individually bundled with candidate ontolo-
gies can be performed by using these gold standard
datasets and measures.

4.1 Scenario
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999951">
The purpose of gene normalization (GN) is to link
genes and proteins mentioned in the literature to
their entries in structured databases of biological
data. It has a substantial impact on tasks such as re-
trieval of relevant documents, identification of inter-
esting genes and proteins, and relationships between
them. The task is challenging even for scientists,
since there is no community wide agreement on how
a particular gene and gene product should be named.
Heavy use of short forms (acronyms or abbrevia-
tions) in biomedical literature makes the problem
worse. In (Tan, 2008) we developed an ontology-
centred system for gene normalization. It relies on
information about gene candidates, contexts of the
symbol and external knowledge sources. Informa-
tion about gene candidates is extracted from gene
databases. Ontologies are used for semantic inter-
pretation of contexts of gene symbols and identifi-
cation of their relevance to gene candidate informa-

tion. Normalization is based on matching contexts
of the symbol to relevant information about gene
candidates.
Figure 1 illustrates the components and data flows
of the system. The system receives a raw text as the
input, and yields database entries of genes appear-
ing in the text: 1) Mapper receives the ontology and
schemas of gene databases, and outputs a list of con-
cepts from the ontology and their mappings to cat-
egories of information stored in gene databases. 2)
Named Entity Recognizer (NER) recognizes relevant
biomedical entities in text by linking them to the
concepts of the ontology which have been mapped
to categories of gene information in mapper. 3)
Gene candidate retrieval retrieves gene candidates
for each gene symbol. The categories of information
about each gene candidate are collected. 4) Match-
ing includes various algorithms that match contexts
of a gene symbol to information about its gene can-
didates according to the mappings obtained in map-
per, and returns similarity values between them. 5)
Normalization ranking ranks gene candidates based
on results of Matching for each gene symbol appear-
ing in a text.

ontology to database schemas. The ontology pro-
vides the model to link information extracted from
literature and data in biological databases.
Component 1
Following the criteria of the component 1, we define
the requirements on the ontology.
Type Based on studies of categories of information
stored in gene databases such as EntrezGene (Ma-
gloot et al., 2005), we decide that top-domain on-
tologies are suitable for our application.
Scope The ontology should represent domain knowl-
edge about genes and gene products. The ontol-
ogy must contain concepts covering the categories
of gene information, e.g. location, functions, and
biological process.
Representation In order to support the task of NER,
the ontology must at least have concepts and in-
stances.
Supporting Technologies In the system the support-
ing technologies include an ontology-driven NLP
tool that support the task of NER, and ontology
alignment algorithms, that can be used to map the
ontology to categories of information in databases.
We look for suitable ontologies by searching
OBO (OBO, 2009) and Bioportal, and reviewing lit-
erature on biomedical ontologies. There are a few
ontologies covering genes and gene products such as
GO, MeSH, the Unified Medical Language System
(UMLS) knowledge sources (Lingberg et al., 1993)
and ontologies from the GENIA project (Kim et al.,
2003). Only two of these meet all the above require-
ments, the UMLS knowledge sources and the GE-
NIA ontologies. The UMLS Semantic Network and
GENIA entity and event ontologies can be seen as
top-domain ontologies, of which the concepts are on
the level of the requirement. The UMLS Metathe-
saurus is primarily concerned with names used in
the domain. It contains a huge number of biomedical
entities and events (called concepts in the Metathe-
saurus) and their various names from more than 100
biomedical vocabularies. All of the concepts are as-
signed to at least one semantic type in the Semantic
Network. The MetaMap program (Aronson, 2001)
is available to map text to the concepts and seman-
tic type. The GENIA project collects a set of MED-
LINE articles concerning transcription factors in hu-
man blood cells. Every biomedical entity and event
appearing in the articles are identified with a con-
cept in the GENIA ontology. Several NLP tools,
e.g. LingPipe (LingPipe, 3.7.0), support statistical
name entity recognition by using the GENIA corpus
as training data.
Component 2
Verification We checked the consistency and redun-
dancy in the UMLS Semantic Network and GE-
NIA ontologies, respectively, by translating them
into OWL format and then sending to the reasoner,
Racer. Both of them are consistent and have mini-
mal representations.
Evaluation We perform two evaluations. The first
evaluation is to investigate the coverage of concepts
of the two ontologies against categories of Entrez-
Gene. The coverage determines the extent of infor-
mation that can be used for gene normalization. In
the second one we compare biomedical entities and
events belonging to concepts of the two ontologies,
since they influence the performance of NER.
- Evaluation 1 Manually, we identify a list of cate-
gories of EntrezGene that are used for gene normal-
ization. Evaluation is performed by aligning con-
cepts of the two ontologies to the categories. A first
observation is that UMLS covers more topics than
GENIA and therefore may give better results for
NER. The topics of the GENIA corpus can be repre-
sented by a query using human, blood cell, transcrip-
tion factor. To be able to compare the coverage of
UMLS and GENIA on an overlapping piece of a do-
main we align the two ontologies based on the GE-
NIA topics. The evaluation is based on an instance-
based strategy proposed in (Tan et al., 2006). The al-
gorithm consists of the following steps: 1) Instance
collection: We retrieve a list of human genes from
the database using human, blood cell, and transcrip-
tion factor. All entities appearing in the categories of
information are collected as instances. 2) Classifica-
tion: For each ontology, each instance is classified
to concepts by a NLP tool. The MetaMap program
is used for the UMLS Semantic Network, and the
LingPipe entity recognition program is used for the
GENIA ontology. An instance can be classified to
more than one concept. 3) Calculation: The simi-
larity between a concept from an ontology (A) and
a category from the EntrezGene (Bj) is determined
by the extent to which the instances of the category

Table 1 shows the alignment results. The left col-
umn gives the categories of gene information we use
for normalization. If the similarity value between a
category and the UMLS semantic type or GENIA
concept is higher than 0.6, they are considered as
corresponding to the category. If no similarity value
is higher than 0.6, we list the two semantic types
or concepts with the highest values. Three of eight
alignments fall into this situation for UMLS seman-
tic types, and two for GENIA concepts. We also
note that the GENIA concept other name appears 4
times, but the meaning of this concept is not well-
defined. Most other categories are aligned to pro-
tein molecule, although the categories are very dif-
ferent. In this evaluation, it is more likely that the
UMLS semantic network is more appropriate than
the GENIA ontology for our system.
- Evaluation 2 35,515 entities of interest in the bi-
ological domain are identified in the GENIA entity
corpus, 7,089 entities of which have been found in
the UMLS Metathesaurus. Since we could not ob-
tain all the UMLS Metathesaurus concepts for each
semantic type, we decided to compare the UMLS
semantic types and GENIA concepts that appear
in the first evaluation, based on these 7,089 shared
instances. The comparison is based on the same
instance-based alignment strategy used in the first
evaluation. Tables 2 and 3 show the alignment re-
sults. In table 2 the value illustrates the extent
to which instances of GENIA concepts support the
UMLS semantic types. We list the three concepts
with the highest values in the table, if they ex-
ist. The concepts in italics are event concepts, the
others are entities. All the UMLS semantic types
cover instances from more than one GENIA con-
cept belonging to a subtree. For example, Gene or
Genome could be aligned to the three GENIA con-
cepts DNA family or group, DNA domain or region
and RNA molecule, which are leaves of the subtree
Nucleotide acid compound. The granularity of the
part of the GENIA ontology concerning the appli-
cation is finer than the corresponding part of the
UMLS semantic network. Table 3 shows the dis-
tribution of the instances of GENIA concepts when
they support UMLS semantic types. Instances of
DNA domain or region and cell component mainly
support Gene or Genome and Cell Component, re-
spectively, which is consistent with our observation
in table 1. Another observation from this table is
that protein molecule covers both Gene or Genome
and Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein. The result also
shows that other name is not well defined. However,
this evaluation does not give a conclusive answer to
which ontology supports the task of NER better.
Component 3
Since component 1 and 2 could not lead to a di-
rect and confident decision, we evaluate the use of
the two ontologies in our system We use a train-
ing dataset from the BioCreative II gene normal-
ization task (Morgan et al., 2008) in the evaluation.
The BioCreative datasets contain Medline abstracts
along with the EntrezGene identifiers corresponding
to the human genes and direct gene products ap-
pearing in the abstracts. The training dataset con-
tain 281 Medline abstracts and 640 human genes.
The MetaMap program is the NLP tool that uses the
UMLS Semantic Network, and the LingPipe entity
recognition program employs GENIA ontology.
Table 4 illustrates the quality of normalization in
the two systems. The quality is measured in terms of
precision, recall and f-measure. Recall (Re.) is de-
fined as the number of correctly disambiguated gene
symbols divided by the number of the gene sym-
bols to be disambiguated. Precision is measured in

symbols correctly and uniquely identified to the real
gene, divided by the total number of genes proposed
in the result regarding the whole data set. Pre.-2 is
computed as the average of the precision of disam-
biguation for each gene symbol. F-measure is the
evenly weighted harmonic mean of precision and re-
call. Pre.-1 and Pre.-2 are used in the computation
of Fm.-1 and Fm.-2, respectively. For both datasets
the quality of normalization from the system bun-
dled with the UMLS is better than the one with the

Overall, the UMLS knowledge source can be con-
sidered as the ontology that is most appropriate for
our gene normalization system. The ontology cov-
ers the subject, genes and gene products, well. The
meaning of the concepts is defined well enough for
the use in the application. The granularity of the
part of the ontology meets the need of the task. The
system bundled with the UMLS and its supporting
technologies produced better results in a gold stan-
dard dataset than the other one.

<bodyText confidence="0.999726136363636">
In this paper we proposed a framework for select-
ing an appropriate ontology for a particular biomed-
ical text mining application. The framework deals
with ontology selection in three components, each
of which considers different aspects of requirements
of text mining applications on ontologies. Then we
present an experiment in which we select a biomedi-
cal ontology for a gene normalization system, using
the framework. Within the framework, evaluation
results lead us to a relatively concrete choice of an
ontology for our system.
In the future we want to evaluate our framework
with more applications and ontologies. Further, cur-
rently there is no service to support ontology selec-
tion for biomedical text mining. Therefore, an im-
portant track for future work is to build or extend an
existing portal with information about the ontologies
and their use in text mining applications that is struc-
tured according to our framework. The information
in such a portal will constitute valuable data and ex-
periences regarding ontology selection that will be
useful for future applications.

Developers of text mining applications often look for appropriate ontologies that can be integrated into their systems, rather than develop new ontologies from scratch. However, there is often a lack of documentation of the qualities of the ontologies. A number of methodologies for evaluating ontologies have been developed, but it is difficult for users by using these methods to select an ontology. In this paper, we propose a framework for selecting the most appropriate ontology for a particular text mining application.

Text mining is an emerging field that attempts to deal with these challenges (Ananiadou and McHought, 2006; Cohen and Hersh, 2005; Spasic et al., 2005). Text mining requires a significant amount of domain knowledge. 55 A large number of biomedical ontologies already exist, and hold much of the information. Some of the ontologies have been designed for modeling domain knowledge, e.g. FMA (Rosse and Mejino, 2003) and GO (Ashburner et al., 2000), others are developed for potential applications, e.g. MeSH (Lowe and Barnett, 1994) for indexing the medical literature. Whatever purposes the ontologies were built for, they are used to support text mining for tasks such as access to text, natural language processing, and information integration. Developers of text mining applications often look for appropriate ontologies that can be integrated into their systems, rather than develop new ontologies from scratch.

Ontologies can be distinguished into three basic types (Stenzhorn et al., 2005): top ontologies, e.g. BFO (Smith, 2004), contain only a restricted set of highly general classes, such as Function and Object, which are not tied to any particular domain of interest; 56 top-domain ontologies, e.g. BioTop (Stenzhorn et al., 2005), contain all classes that are essentially needed to describe a certain domain, such as Organism, Cell and Tissue in the case of biology; and domain ontologies, e.g. GO (Ashburner et al., 2000), contain classes that comprehensively describe a certain domain of interest. For example, for natural language processing tasks such as entity recognition, a topdomain ontology may be sufficient. - Scope What are the main subjects that need to be covered in a top-domain or domain ontology required by the application? For example, gene and disease are the domains that concern (Hristovski et al., 2005). - Representation What kind of information needs to be present in the ontology?

Supporting Technologies In the system the supporting technologies include an ontology-driven NLP tool that support the task of NER, and ontology alignment algorithms, that can be used to map the ontology to categories of information in databases. We look for suitable ontologies by searching OBO (OBO, 2009) and Bioportal, and reviewing literature on biomedical ontologies. There are a few ontologies covering genes and gene products such as GO, MeSH, the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) knowledge sources (Lingberg et al., 1993) and ontologies from the GENIA project (Kim et al., 2003). Only two of these meet all the above requirements, the UMLS knowledge sources and the GENIA ontologies. The UMLS Semantic Network and GENIA entity and event ontologies can be seen as top-domain ontologies, of which the concepts are on the level of the requirement. The UMLS Metathesaurus is primarily concerned with names used in the domain. It contains a huge number of biomedical entities and events (called concepts in the Metathesaurus) and their various names from more than 100 biomedical vocabularies. All of the concepts are assigned to at least one semantic type in the Semantic Network. T</context>

We propose three characteristics to be considered, - Type What is the kind of the ontology required in the scenario? Ontologies can be distinguished into three basic types (Stenzhorn et al., 2005): top ontologies, e.g. BFO (Smith, 2004), contain only a restricted set of highly general classes, such as Function and Object, which are not tied to any particular domain of interest; 56 top-domain ontologies, e.g. BioTop (Stenzhorn et al., 2005), contain all classes that are essentially needed to describe a certain domain, such as Organism, Cell and Tissue in the case of biology; and domain ontologies, e.g. GO (Ashburner et al., 2000), contain classes that comprehensively describe a certain domain of interest. For example, for natural language processing tasks such as entity recognition, a topdomain ontology may be sufficient. - S</context>

The necessity of understanding actions of individual biological components in system context rather than in isolation, extends the coverage of literature far beyond the capabilities of individual scientists. Text mining is an emerging field that attempts to deal with these challenges (Ananiadou and McHought, 2006; Cohen and Hersh, 2005; Spasic et al., 2005). Text mining requires a significant amount of domain knowledge. 55 A large number of biomedical ontologies already exist, and hold much of the information. Some of the ontologies have been designed for modeling domain knowledge, e.g. FMA (Rosse and Mejino, 2003) and GO (Ashburner et al., 2000), others are developed for potential applications, e.g. MeSH (Lowe and Barnett, 1994) for indexing the medical literature. Whatever purposes the ontologies were built for, they are used to support text mining for tasks such as access to text, natural language processing, and information integration. Deve</context>

It has a substantial impact on tasks such as retrieval of relevant documents, identification of interesting genes and proteins, and relationships between them. The task is challenging even for scientists, since there is no community wide agreement on how a particular gene and gene product should be named. Heavy use of short forms (acronyms or abbreviations) in biomedical literature makes the problem worse. In (Tan, 2008) we developed an ontologycentred system for gene normalization. It relies on information about gene candidates, contexts of the symbol and external knowledge sources. Information about gene candidates is extracted from gene databases. Ontologies are used for semantic interpretation of contexts of gene symbols and identification of their relevance to gene candidate informadisambiguated gene symbols tion. Normalization is based on matching contexts of the symbol to relevant information about gene candidates. Figure 1 illustrates the components and data flows of the system.

Evaluation is performed by aligning concepts of the two ontologies to the categories. A first observation is that UMLS covers more topics than GENIA and therefore may give better results for NER. The topics of the GENIA corpus can be represented by a query using human, blood cell, transcription factor. To be able to compare the coverage of UMLS and GENIA on an overlapping piece of a domain we align the two ontologies based on the GENIA topics. The evaluation is based on an instancebased strategy proposed in (Tan et al., 2006). The algorithm consists of the following steps: 1) Instance collection: We retrieve a list of human genes from the database using human, blood cell, and transcription factor. All entities appearing in the categories of information are collected as instances. 2) Classification: For each ontology, each instance is classified to concepts by a NLP tool. The MetaMap program is used for the UMLS Semantic Network, and the LingPipe entity recognition program is used for the GENIA ontology.
