This paper proposes a hierarchical text catego-
rization (TC) approach to encoding free-text
clinical notes with ICD-9-CM codes. Prelim-
inary experimental result on the 2007 Com-
putational Medicine Challenge data shows a
hierarchical TC system has achieved a micro-
averaged Fl value of 86.6, which is compara-
ble to the performance of state-of-the-art flat

The task of assigning meaningful categories to free
text has attracted researchers in the Natural Lan-
guage Processing (NLP) and Information Retrieval
(IR) field for more than 10 years. However, it has
only recently emerged as a hot topic in the clinical
domain where categories to be assigned are orga-
nized in taxonomies which cover common medical
concepts and link them together in hierarchies. This
paper evaluates the effectiveness of adopting a hi-
erarchical text categorization approach to the 2007
Computational Medicine Challenge which aims to
assign appropriate ICD-9-CM codes to free text ra-
diology reports. (Pestian et al., 2007)
The ICD-9-CM 1, which stands for International
Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical
Modification, is an international standard which is
used for classifying common medical concepts, such
as diseases, symptoms and signs, by hospitals, insur-
ance companies, and other health organizations. The
2007 Computational Medicine Challenge was set in

a billing scenario in which hospitals claim reim-
bursement from health insurance companies based
on the ICD-9-CM codes assigned to each patient
case. The competition has successfully attracted 44
submissions with a mean micro-averaged Fl perfor-
mance of 76.70. (Pestian et al., 2007)
To the best of our knowledge, the systems re-
ported were all adopting a flat classification ap-
proach in which a dedicated classifier has been built
for every targeted ICD-9-CM code. Each classifier
makes a binary decision of True or False according
to whether or not a clinical note should be assigned
with the targeted ICD-9-CM code. An incoming
clinical note has to be tested against all the classi-
fiers before a final coding decision can be made. The
response time of a flat approach therefore grows lin-
early with the number of categories in the taxonomy.
Moreover, low-frequency ICD-9-CM codes suffer
the data imbalance problem in which positive train-
ing instances are overwhelmed by negative ones.
A hierarchical system takes into account relation-
ships among categories. Classifiers are assigned
to both leaf and internal nodes of a taxonomy and
training instances are distributed among these nodes.
When a test instance comes in, a coding decision is
made by generating all possible paths (start from the
root node of the taxonomy) where classifiers along
path return favorable decisions. In other words, a
node is visited only if the classifier assigned to its
parent returns a True decision. This strategy signif-
icantly reduces the average number of classifiers to
be used in the test stage when the taxonomy is very
large. (Liu et al., 2005; Yang et al., 2003)

Most top systems in the 2007 Computational
Medicine Challenge have benefited from incorpo-
rating domain knowledge of free-text clinical notes,
such as negation, synonymy, and hypernymy, ei-
ther as hand-crafted rules in a symbolic approach,
or as carefully engineered features in a machine-
learning component. (Goldstein et al., 2007; Farkas
and Szarvas, 2007; Crammer et al., 2007; Aronson
et al., 2007; Patrick et al., 2007)
Aronson et al. (2007) used a variant of National
Library of Medicine Medical Text Indexer (MTI)
which was originally developed for discovering
Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) 2 terms for in-
dexing biomedical citations and articles. The output
of MTI was converted into ICD-9-CM codes by ap-
plying different approaches of mapping discovered
Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) 3 con-
cepts into ICD-9-CM codes, such as using synonym
and built-in mapping relations in UMLS Metathe-
saurus. This approach can easily adapt to any sub-
domain of the UMLS Metathesaurus since it only
requires very little examples for tuning purposes.
However, MTI performed slightly behind an SVM
system with only bag-of-words features, which sug-
gests the difficulty of optimizing a general purpose
system without any statistical learning on the tar-
geted corpus. By stacking MTI, SVM, KNN and a
simple pattern matching system together, a final Fl
score of 85 was reported on the official test set.
Farkas and Szarvas (2007) automatically translate
definitions of the ICD-9-CM into rules of a sym-
bolic system. Decision tree was then used to model
the disagreement between the prediction of the sys-
tem and the gold-standard annotation of the training
data set. This has improved the performance of the
system to a Fl value of 89. Goldstein et al. (2007)
also reported that a rule-based system enhanced by
negation, synonymy, and uncertainty information,
has outperformed machine learning models which
only use n-gram features. The rules were manually
tuned for every ICD-9-CM code found in the chal-
lenge training data set and therefore suffer the scal-
ing up problem.
On the other hand, researchers tried to encode do-

developing more sophisticated feature types. Patrick

to model human coder’s expertise, such as negation
and code overlaps. Different combination of fea-
ture types were tested for each individual ICD-9-CM
code and the best combination was used in the final
system. Crammer et al. (2007) also used a rich fea-
ture set in their MIRA system which is an online

The corpus used in this study is the official data
set of the 2007 Computational Medicine Challenge.
The challenge corpus consists of 1,954 radiology re-
ports from the Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Med-
ical Center and was divided into a training set with
978 records, and a test set with 976 records. The
statistics of the corpus is shown in Table 1.
Each radiology record in the corpus has two sec-
tions: ‘Clinical History’ which is provided by an
ordering physician before a radiological procedure,
and ‘Impression’ which is reported by a radiologist
after the procedure. A typical radiology report is
shown below:

Three different institutions were invited to assign
ICD-9-CM codes to the corpus. The majority code
with at least two votes from the three annotators was
considered as the gold-standard code for the record.
Moreover, a clinical record can be assigned with
multiple ICD-9-CM codes at a time.
The general guideline of assigning ICD-9-CM
codes includes two important rules:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.922328714285714">
• If there is a definite diagnosis in text, the
diagnosis should be coded and all symptom
and sign codes should be ignored.
• If the diagnosis is undecided, or there is no
diagnosis found, the symptoms and signs
should be coded rather than the uncertain
diagnosis.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.997235866666667">
According to the guideline, the above radiology
record should be assigned with only a ‘Cough’ code
because ‘Atelectasis’ and ‘Pneumonia’ are not cer-
tain, and ‘Fever’ has been negated.
There are 45 ICD-9-CM codes found in the cor-
pus and their distribution is imbalanced. Figure 1
shows a pie chart of three types of the ICD-9-CM
codes found in the corpus and their accumulated cat-
egory frequencies. The 20 low-frequency (less than
10 occurrences) codes account for only 3% of the to-
tal code occurrence in the challenge data set. There
are 19 codes with a frequency between 10 and 100
and altogether they account for 34% total code oc-
currence. Finally, the most frequent six codes ac-
count for over 60% of total code instances.

4 Hierarchical Text Categorization
Framework
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999368909090909">
In a hierarchical text categorization system, cate-
gories are linked together and classifiers are as-
signed to each node in the taxonomy. In the training
stage, instances are distributed to their correspond-
ing nodes. For instance, Figure 2 shows a populated
subtree of ICD-9-CM code ‘786’ which covers con-
cepts involving respiratory system and other chest
symptoms. Nodes in grey box such as 786.2 and
786.5 are among 45 gold-standard codes found in
the challenge data set. Nodes in white box such as
786 and 786.0 are internal nodes which have non-
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.996832">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.99995959375">
empty subtrees. For instance, the numbers (0, 698)
of ‘786’ suggest that the node is assigned with zero
instances for training while there are 698 positive
instances assigned to nodes in its subtree. The node
‘786.1’ is in dotted box because there is no instance
assigned to it, nor any of its subtrees. In the ex-
periment, all nodes (such as ‘786.1’) with empty in-
stance in its subtree were removed from the training
and testing stage.
When training a classifier for a node A in the tree,
all the instances in the subtree rooted in the parent of
A become the only source of training instances. For
instance, code ‘786.0’ in Figure 2 uses all the 698 in-
stances rooted in node ‘786’ as the full training data
set. The 98 instances rooted in node ‘786.0’ itself
are the positive instances while the remaining 600
instances in the tree as the negative ones. This hier-
archical approach of distributing training instances
can reduce the size of training data set for most clas-
sifiers and minimize the data imbalance problem for
low-frequency codes in the taxonomy.
In the test stage, the system starts from the root of
the ICD-9-CM taxonomy and evaluates an incoming
clinical note against classifiers assigned to its chil-
dren nodes. The system will then visit every child
node which returns a positive classification result.
The process repeats recursively until a possible path
ends by reaching a node that returns a negative clas-
sification result. This strategy enables the sytem to
assign multiple codes to a clinical note by visiting
different paths in the ICD-9-CM taxonomy simulta-
neously.

<bodyText confidence="0.999767863636364">
A tree of ICD-9-CM taxonomy was constructed
by enquiring the UMLS Metathesaurus. During
each iteration of 10-fold cross-validation experi-
ment, the training instances were assigned to the
ICD-9-CM tree and all nodes assigned with zero
training instance in its subtree were removed from
the tree. This ended with an ICD-9-CM tree with
around 100 nodes for each training and test iteration.
Nodes in the tree were uniquely identified by
their concept id (CUI) found in the UMLS Metathe-
saurus. However, two ICD-9-CM codes (‘599.0’
and ‘V13.02’) were found to share the same CUI in
the UMLS Metathesaurus. As a result, 44 unique
UMLS CUIs were used as the gold-standard codes
in the experiment for the original 45 ICD-9-CM
codes.
In the test stage, the hierarchical system returns
the terminal nodes of the predicted path. Moreover,
if the terminal ends in an internal code which is not
one of the 44 gold-standard UMLS CUI found in the
training corpus, the system should ignore the whole
path.

A small set of 35 negation keywords, such as

to trigger the finding of the negated phrases
in text based on the shallow syntactic analy-
sis returned by GENIA tagger. After removing
negated phrases in text, MetaMap was used to
find medical concepts in text as new features in
a bag-of-concepts manner (F3 and F4).
Different combination of feature types (F5, F6,

6 Result and Discussion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999915705882353">
The 10-fold cross-validation technique was used in
the experiments. The 1,954 radiology reports were
randomly divided into ten folds. In each iteration of
the experiment, one fold of data was used as the test
set and the other nine folds as the training set.
The experimental results are shown in Table 2.
The flat TC system has achieved higher F1 scores
than a hierarchical TC system in all experimental
settings. However, paired t-test suggests the differ-
ences are not statistically significant at a (p &lt; 0.05)
level in most cases. This suggests the potential of
adopting a hierarchical TC approach in the task. The
effectiveness of the system is not sacrificed while the
system now has the potential to scale up to much
larger problems.
Similarly, the hierarchical TC system has better
F hierarchical scores than the flat TC system while

<bodyText confidence="0.999875842105263">
this difference is still not statistically significant at
a (p &lt; 0.05) level in most cases. This is partly
due to the current strategy of not allowing unknown
ICD-9-CM codes to be assigned in the system. As a
result, many originally predicted internal nodes were
removed in a hierarchical TC system.
Both the flat and hierarchical systems using bag-
of-words feature set F1 have achieved a F1 score
above 0.85. Adding bigram features into F2 has
shown minimum impact on the performance of both
systems. Using a bag-of-concepts strategy in F3
and F4 has lowered the performance of the system.
However, adding F3 and F4 into bag-of-words fea-
ture set has improved the performance of both sys-
tems. Finally, the best performance were reported
on using feature set F5 which combines unigram and
ICD-9-CM concepts returned by MetaMap software
on the preprocessed text where negated terms were
removed.

The system will then visit every child node which returns a positive classification result. The process repeats recursively until a possible path ends by reaching a node that returns a negative classification result. This strategy enables the sytem to assign multiple codes to a clinical note by visiting different paths in the ICD-9-CM taxonomy simultaneously. 5 Methods and Experiments 5.1 Experiment Settings In this study, Support Vector Machines (SVM) was used for both flat and hierarchical text categorization. The LibSVM (Chang and Lin, 2001) package was used with a linear kernel. 5.1.1 Hierarchical TC A tree of ICD-9-CM taxonomy was constructed by enquiring the UMLS Metathesaurus. During each iteration of 10-fold cross-validation experiment, the training instances were assigned to the ICD-9-CM tree and all nodes assigned with zero training instance in its subtree were removed from the tree. This ended with an ICD-9-CM tree with around 100 nodes for each training and test iteration. Nodes in the tree were uniquely identified by their concept id (CUI) found in the UMLS Metathesaurus. However, two ICD-9-CM codes (‘599.0’ and ‘V13.02</context>

Moreover, a hierarchical micro-averaged F (hierarchical) is also introduced by adding all an1 cestors of the current gold-standard code into calculation. The F(hierarchical) value helps to evaluate 1 how accurate a system predicts in terms of the goldstandard path in the ICD-9-CM tree. 5.4 Features The feature set is descibed in Table 2. • Bag-of-words Both unigram (F1) and bigram (F2) were used. • Negation and Bag-of-concepts An algorithm similar to NegEx (Chapman et al., 2001) was used to find negations in text. A small set of 35 negation keywords, such as ‘no’, ‘without’, and ‘no further’, was compiled to trigger the finding of the negated phrases in text based on the shallow syntactic analysis returned by GENIA tagger. After removing negated phrases in text, MetaMap was used to find medical concepts in text as new features in a bag-of-concepts manner (F3 and F4). Different combination of feature types (F5, F6, and F7) were also used in the experiment.

However, it has only recently emerged as a hot topic in the clinical domain where categories to be assigned are organized in taxonomies which cover common medical concepts and link them together in hierarchies. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of adopting a hierarchical text categorization approach to the 2007 Computational Medicine Challenge which aims to assign appropriate ICD-9-CM codes to free text radiology reports. (Pestian et al., 2007) The ICD-9-CM 1, which stands for International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification, is an international standard which is used for classifying common medical concepts, such as diseases, symptoms and signs, by hospitals, insurance companies, and other health organizations. The 2007 Computational Medicine Challenge was set in 1see http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/icd9.htm a billing scenario in which hospitals claim reimbursement from health insurance companies based on the ICD-9-CM codes assigned to each patient case.
