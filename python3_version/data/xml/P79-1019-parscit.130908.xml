People talk about what they do, often at the same
time as they are doing. This reporting has an
important function in coordinating action between
people working together on real everyday problems. It
is also an important source of data for social
scientists studying people&apos;s behavior. In this paper,
we report on some studies we are doing on report
dialogues. We describe two kinds of phenomena we have
identified, outline a preliminary process model that
integrates the report generation with the processes
that are generating the actions being reported upon,
and specify a systematic methodology for extracting
relevant evidence bearing on these phenomena from text
transcripts of talk about doing to use in evaluating
the model.

Reports of problem solving actions are often used as
evidence about the underlying cognitive processes
involved in generating a problem solution, as &amp;quot;problem
solving protocols&amp;quot; (Newell &amp; Simon, 1972). However,
these reports are obviously a kind of language
interaotion in their own right, in which the subject is
reporting on his/her own actions to the experimenter.
We have analyzed problem solving protocols of people
solving a puzzle called &amp;quot;Missionaries and Cannibals&amp;quot;
and have found that in their reports, people adopt a
&amp;quot;point of view&amp;quot; with respect to the problem, through a
consistent use of spatial deixis. For example, when a
subject says:
&amp;quot;... I can&apos;t send another cannibal across with
another missionary or he will be outnumbered when he
gets to the other side &amp;quot;
the deixis in her report places her as speaker on the
&amp;quot;from&amp;quot; side of the considered action. This is
indicated both by the choice of the verb &amp;quot;send&amp;quot; and by
the description of &amp;quot;the other side&amp;quot;. The same subject
indicated the &amp;quot;to&amp;quot; side as her point of view in another
part of her protocol:
&amp;quot;...&apos;oause you&apos;ve gotta have one person to bring
back the boat...&amp;quot;4
Here, both the verb &amp;quot;bring&amp;quot; and the adverb &amp;quot;back&amp;quot;
indicate &amp;quot;point of view&amp;quot;.
Although people almost always unambiguously
specify a &amp;quot;point of view&amp;quot; within the problem they are
solving in their reports, they also deny awareness of
taking such a point of view. However, this point of
view is important to the underlying problem solving
processes. The strongest evidence for this oomes from
the high correlation between point of view and errors
in problem solving actions. Subjects in the
Missionaries and Cannibals task can maks errors by
taking lotions that violate the constraints of the
task. Most of these errors occur on the side away from
their current &amp;quot;point of view&amp;quot;, even though their point
of view changes from one physical side to the other
during the course of solving the puzzle. More
interesting is that most of the &amp;quot;undetected&amp;quot; errors
occur on the side away from their point of view. Some
errors are spontaneously detected by the subject
immediately after taking the action that leads to a
violation; others are &amp;quot;undetected&amp;quot;. After the
experimenter interrupts to point out these undetected
errors, the subjects often switch point of view 30 that
the violation condition is now on the same side as the
subjects&apos; point of view.
We see the point of view indicated by spatial
deixis in the report of problem solving as reflecting
an underlying allocation of effort (or attention). Few
errors occur with problem elements that are given
processing effort, while constraints that are given
little attention are more often violated.
In this way, these reports are reflecting changes in
the organization of the problem elements that occur
over the course of reaching a solution. We have also
identified other ways in which reports embody the use
of different conceptual organizations of the problem,
including organizations that vary from abstract to
concrete and from perception oriented to action
oriented.

There are multi-utterance struotures that occur
regularly in problem solving talk that we call
&amp;quot;justification argument structures.&amp;quot; These structures
have the form of:
(did ) (do ) (since )
(oould)+(not do),(aotion)+(because)0(ju5tifi01ti0n
(will ) argument)
(Alternatively, these two segments can be reversed in
order, by using connectives like &amp;quot;therefore&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;so&amp;quot;.)
For example, these kinds of dialogue units occur in
many of the protocols studied by Newell &amp; Simon (1972):
&amp;quot;Each letter has one and only one numarioal value
404.
(E: One numerical value.) There are ten different
letters and each of them has one numerical value.
Therefore, I can, looking at the two D&apos;s each D is
5; therefore, T is zero.&amp;quot; (Newell tt Simon,
1972:250431)
In studying our problem solving protocols from the
Missionaries and Cannibals puzzle, we have identified
several kinds of argument structures, depending on what
kinds of problem solving approach each subject took to
the problem at each point in time. For example, one
common justification argument structure is the
&amp;quot;elimination of alternatives&amp;quot; structure: All available
actions An from this state except Ai can be ruled out.
Therefore do action A4. Here is an example of this
kind of argument struSture:
&amp;quot;... If I put a cannibal on, then he goes back and
the guys on the other side of the river, the
missionary, is outnumbered and he will be eaten.
If I put on.... this is all my combinations and
permutations.... If / put two missionaries on, I
mean two cannibals on the boat and send them back,
then it is just ridiculous at the other end. ...
so what I&apos;ll have to do is one of each.&amp;quot;
Another argument form is one we call &amp;quot;pragmatic
argument&amp;quot;. (We have borrowed many of our names for

argument structures from a rhetoric book (Perelman 4
Olbrechta*Tytecal 1969)0 Although this book is a
&amp;quot;normative&amp;quot; aocount of argumentation, we find it
valuable as a guide to our attempt to give a
descriptive account of naturally occurring informal
&amp;quot;argumentation&amp;quot; occurring in our subjects&apos; reports of
their problem solving.) The pragmatic arguments ist
Doing action A would lead to result R (among other
things). Result R is undesirable. Therefore don&apos;t do
action A.
An example from our protocols ist
&amp;quot;... Both missionaries are going to have to come
back because. &apos;cause if they don&apos;t come back,
well, one would get left and eaten. So both
missionaries come back. &amp;quot;
One interesting point about this particular example is
that it is embedded within an &amp;quot;elimination of
alternatives&amp;quot; argument structure. That is, this
&amp;quot;pragmatic argument&amp;quot; is used to eliminate one of the
alternatives, leaving only one to take.
A third kind of argument struoture we have
identified is called &amp;quot;ends-means&amp;quot;; If state $ occurs,
then there is an action A to get to goal 0. Therefore
establish state 3 as a subgoal.
For example;
&amp;quot;... So it ever I could get these over there, I
would be O.K. ...&amp;quot;
Obviously, this argument form is similar to the classic
&amp;quot;means-ends analysis&amp;quot; proposed as part of many current
theories of problem solving. The argument forms we
have identified occur when certain kinds of underlying
cognitive processing is going on, and this kind of
protocol text has been used as evidence for this
underlying processing. Some people have assumed that
this kind of language interaction corresponds to a
subset of the underlying processes (Newell 4 Simon,
1972). Other people have questioned whether there is
any correspondence between what people do and what they
say (Nisbett 4 Wilson, 1977). Our position is that
there is a fairly rich interaction between action and
report of action, whioh we will describe in our report
of our preliminary process model of doing and
reporting. (This position is similar to one outlined
recently by Iriosson 4 Simon (1979).)
=MA =AL. fiL 1122ELAS1111=110.
We have been constructing a process model of
problem solving within an activation process framework
(Levin, 1976; 1978). Within this framework, multiple
processes are simultaneously active, and the the
interactions between the active processes is specified
by their representations in a network structured long
term memory. Each process is active a certain amount,
with a certain amount of &amp;quot;salience&amp;quot;, and the more
salient a process is, the larger its impact on other
processes (and therefore on the overall processing).
There are processes that are closely related to
the performance of the problem task, and others that
are closely related to the report of the task actions.
In the particular problem domain of the Missionaries
and Cannibals pussle, the task related actions and
objects are defined as concepts in the long term memory
that become active during the problem solving. The .
constraints of the problem are represented in the same
way, and get activated to varying degrees during the
problem solving. Errors occur when the constraints are
insufficiently salient to prevent an action which leads
to a violation of that constraint.
Report related processes impact the task behavior
by modifying the distribution of salience to the task
related processes. &amp;quot;Point of view&amp;quot; of the problem
solver has its impact on the processing by adding
salience to those active concepts associated with
location where the problem solver has conceptually
located him/herself. Justification argument structures
similarly impact the distribution of salience by
increasing the salience of of those inference processes
defined to be associated with the argument structures.
In this way, language can aid the problem solving, by
adding to the resources of the talked about processes.
It can also hinder if it looks the problem solver into
a particular organisation of the problem that isn&apos;t
fruitful. For example, to the extent that language use
Focusses salienoe away from constraints that are being
violated causing errors, and especially if this occurs
to such an extent that these errors are undetected,
then the focussing effect of language can be a barrier
to solving the problem.
SVALUITION
So far, we have described some phenomena we have
observed in our collection of problem solving reports,
and also a preliminary process model of problem solving
action and report. Now can we use our data to evaluate
our model?
There are many levels of evaluative testing that
we could use. At one extreme, theories can be strongly
evaluated by deriving predictions from them of specific
data, which is then collected. Kapeoially when the
predicted data are unexpected, this provides a rigorous
test of a theory.
At another extreme is a &amp;quot;sufficiency test&amp;quot; (Nowell
Simon. 1972). A model of an organism performing some
task passes the sufficiency test if it also can perform
the same task. This is the evaluation test commonly
used today for artificial intelligence models.
A more rigorous test is to try to fit a model to a mess
of data. This is the evaluation technique most often
used today in evaluating cognitive psychology theories.
A fourth technique is to identify a set of &amp;quot;critical&amp;quot;
phenomena in the data against which to evaluate a model
of that data. As illustrated in the list below, this
is a more powerful evaluation technique that simple
sufficiency, but less powerful than the other two
techniques. We feel that at this point in the state of
the art, this is the appropriate evaluation technique
to use to evaluate our process model in light of our
data.

We have reported here a three pronged approach to
the study of problem solving action and report: 1) the
collected of data on problem solving and talk about
problem solving, 2) development of a process model of
these behaviors, and 3) use of coding techniques to
extract traces of &amp;quot;critical phenomena&amp;quot; from the
transcripts for evaluating the model. So far, we have
focussed our efforts on two types of problem solving
phenomena: the changes in the problem solver&apos;s
organization of the problem (&amp;quot;point of view&amp;quot;), and
systematic multi-utterance structures used to express
the forma of inference used to solve the problem

Other people have questioned whether there is any correspondence between what people do and what they say (Nisbett 4 Wilson, 1977). Our position is that there is a fairly rich interaction between action and report of action, whioh we will describe in our report of our preliminary process model of doing and reporting. (This position is similar to one outlined recently by Iriosson 4 Simon (1979).) =MA =AL. fiL 1122ELAS1111=110. We have been constructing a process model of problem solving within an activation process framework (Levin, 1976; 1978). Within this framework, multiple processes are simultaneously active, and the the interactions between the active processes is specified by their representations in a network structured long term memory. Each process is active a certain amount, with a certain amount of &amp;quot;salience&amp;quot;, and the more salient a process is, the larger its impact on other processes (and therefore on the overall processing). There are processes that are closely related to the performance of the problem task, and others that are closely related to the report of the task actions.

We describe two kinds of phenomena we have identified, outline a preliminary process model that integrates the report generation with the processes that are generating the actions being reported upon, and specify a systematic methodology for extracting relevant evidence bearing on these phenomena from text transcripts of talk about doing to use in evaluating the model. EMT CIE 1.111 Reports of problem solving actions are often used as evidence about the underlying cognitive processes involved in generating a problem solution, as &amp;quot;problem solving protocols&amp;quot; (Newell &amp; Simon, 1972). However, these reports are obviously a kind of language interaotion in their own right, in which the subject is reporting on his/her own actions to the experimenter. We have analyzed problem solving protocols of people solving a puzzle called &amp;quot;Missionaries and Cannibals&amp;quot; and have found that in their reports, people adopt a &amp;quot;point of view&amp;quot; with respect to the problem, through a consistent use of spatial deixis. For example, when a subject says: &amp;quot;... I can&apos;t send another cannibal across with another missionary or he will be outnumbered when he gets to the other side &amp;quot; the deixis in her report </context>

JIUST/F/CAT/ON ANUMENT STRUCTURES There are multi-utterance struotures that occur regularly in problem solving talk that we call &amp;quot;justification argument structures.&amp;quot; These structures have the form of: (did ) (do ) (since ) (oould)+(not do),(aotion)+(because)0(ju5tifi01ti0n (will ) argument) (Alternatively, these two segments can be reversed in order, by using connectives like &amp;quot;therefore&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;so&amp;quot;.) For example, these kinds of dialogue units occur in many of the protocols studied by Newell &amp; Simon (1972): &amp;quot;Each letter has one and only one numarioal value 404. (E: One numerical value.) There are ten different letters and each of them has one numerical value. Therefore, I can, looking at the two D&apos;s each D is 5; therefore, T is zero.&amp;quot; (Newell tt Simon, 1972:250431) In studying our problem solving protocols from the Missionaries and Cannibals puzzle, we have identified several kinds of argument structures, depending on what kinds of problem solving approach each subject took to the problem at each point in time. For example, one common justification argument structure is the &amp;quot;elimination of alte</context>
