This book grew out of the 1990 AAAI Symposium of the same name, which explored
&amp;quot;new ways to take advantage of the power of on-line text&amp;quot; (p. vii). Nine papers were
selected from the symposium, and most of them have been significantly expanded
with more discussion or examples or updated with more recent research. Two of the
participants, Zernik and Sparck Jones, contributed new papers to this collection. In
addition, three papers by Jacobs, Hobbs et al., and Croft and Turtle have been added
that provide a context for the other papers. According to Jacobs, &amp;quot;This volume is
aimed at an audience of computer professionals who have at least some knowledge
of natural language and IR, but it has also been prepared with advanced students
in mind&amp;quot; (p. viii). The book is arranged in three sections: &amp;quot;Broad-scale NLP,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Tra-
ditional&apos; information retrieval,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Emerging applications.&amp;quot; The first two sections
describe current issues and methods in use in NLP and IR. The third section presents
research applications that represent the opportunities made available by combining
NLP and IR techniques. Each chapter is followed by its own bibliography, and there
is a brief index of names and topics for the book as a whole. The use of the word
intelligent in the title is a little misleading, and Jacobs admits that some contributors
had doubts about it. Rather than referring to Al knowledge—based systems, it is meant
to describe systems that are &amp;quot;fast, effective, and helpful&amp;quot; (p. vii).
In the preface, Jacobs comments on the importance of the cross-fertilization of NLP
and IR for text retrieval, an area that has received increasing attention in recent years.
IR has expanded from its traditional task of producing a set of relevant document
citations from a bibliographic database, and now includes diverse activities such as fact
retrieval, text categorization, and the construction and use of hypertext links. (See, for
example, the chapters by Maarek, Hayes, and Salton and Buckley, respectively.) Most
of the papers in this collection describe specific projects or systems; and the details of
their components and processes, the liberal use of examples, and the descriptions of
their results give the reader a good idea of the sense of excitement felt by researchers
and practitioners in this field.
In the first chapter, Jacobs introduces the major themes that recur, implicitly and
explicitly, throughout the book. Overall, these could be described as a need for more
&amp;quot;realism&amp;quot; in the size and nature of the tasks that research in NLP and IR addresses.
Applications must deal with very large corpora (millions of words), must be able to
obtain their results in very short periods of time, and must do so with an acceptable
level of performance. For example, a story classifier must be able to keep up with a
real-time news feed, and a retrieval system must be able to extract relevant documents

from an enormous collection before the user gets impatient. These requirements place
constraints on the kinds of processing that are practical, and lead to interesting discus-
sions on weak versus strong methods, and the depth of processing and representation
that is really necessary for various types of retrieval. The chapters in the first section
of the book, especially those by Wilks et al., Hirst and Ryan, and McDonald, focus on
these issues. In addition, what happens when these approaches fail is important, since
a real-world text processing system cannot usually wait for human intervention and
guidance. Given the range of vocabulary, topic, and text style that systems must han-
dle, one must assume that there will be unfamiliar words and structures. Robustness
and using incomplete information are discussed in the chapters by Hobbs et al. and
McDonald, among others.
As Jacobs notes in his brief introduction to the second section, IR has always had
a more immediate concern about evaluation than most NLP research. &amp;quot;If a technique
does not significantly increase the percentage of relevant text that a user sees, or sig-
nificantly decrease the amount of irrelevant text, it is considered altogether unproven&amp;quot;
(p. 125). There is a great deal of discussion in IR as to the best way to measure retrieval
performance, but DARPA&apos;s MUC-3 and TIPSTER evaluation workshops demonstrate
the advantages of more rigorous evaluations that allow comparisons between different
approaches to be made. These workshops are mentioned briefly in the book; details
of MUC-3 are given by Sundheim (1991).
The chapters in the second section clarify the fact that there are really two parts
to the question of how to combine NLP and IR: Which NLP techniques are useful
in IR? To which stages of the IR process should they be applied? IR could be (very)
loosely described as finding relationships between a query and some text, and a va-
riety of approaches are presented, from representing structural relationships between
words, phrases, and larger sections of text (Lewis; Salton and Buckley) to inferring re-
lationships from Bayesian networks of concept nodes (Croft and Turtle). Sparck Jones
provides a warning that full text approaches should not be applied blindly, and Lewis
echoes her in saying that it is important to look at previous IR research, including
that using nonautomatic methods, for clues as to which areas are likely to be the
most fruitful. Sparck Jones especially recommends a look at indexing as a profitable
area. While this selection of papers might not provide a representative introduction to
current IR research, it does demonstrate the diversity apparent in the field.
Papers in the third section describe some of the work that falls at the junction of
NLP and IR. These range from a system already in commercial use (the categorization
system described by Hayes), through a system that has had some limited use and eval-
uation (Maarek&apos;s GURU, which constructs a help system from online documentation),
to a highly experimental system for identifying if an agent is &amp;quot;in favor of, neutral, or
opposed to the event&amp;quot; described in the text (Hearst). The first chapter, by Stanfill and
Waltz, seems a little out of place. It gives a brief description of how statistics and AI
might fit into the text retrieval picture. This is a very rich topic, and probably deserves
more space to fully develop these issues than it has here.
The overall quality of the papers is good. By and large, they give a clear conceptual
background for the research, justifying the importance of the themes presented above.
Sufficient details and examples are provided to give a general understanding of the
research, and the reader can refer to work listed in the bibliographies for more. The
organization of the book works fairly well, although I might quibble with the order
of a couple of the chapters (Croft and Turtle and Sparck Jones, for instance). It is
unfortunate that some of the few proofreading errors are in the bibliographies, such
as the omission of the Robertson and Hancock-Beaulieu reference cited on page 171,
and the title missing from the Kirkpatrick et al. reference on page 56. (See the references

below.) However, Jacobs does mention that the book was rushed to press in order to
keep the contents as current as possible.
The reader who is only slightly acquainted with NLP and IR, or only familiar with
one of these areas, will find this an introduction to the issues and (dare I say?) signs
of progress that make this such an exciting area of research today. Those with more
experience will find a good discussion of both the theoretical bases of the field and the
practical concerns of implementing text-based systems. Finally, those who have read
the original symposium working notes will find interesting additions to the earlier
papers—a chance to find out &amp;quot;what happened next.&amp;quot;
