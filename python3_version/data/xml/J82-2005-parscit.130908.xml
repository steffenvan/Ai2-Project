A Manhattan project could produce an atomic
bomb, and the heroic efforts of the sixties could put a
man on the moon, but even an all-out effort on the
scale of these would probably not solve the translation
problem. In one sense, this almost goes without say-
ing. The first ninety percent of the work that was
invested in reaching the moon did not get the astro-
nauts nine-tenths of the way there and the heat gener-
ated by the bomb did not increase steadily as the date
of the first explosion approached. The translation
problem is one whose solution must be reached incre-
mentally. There will be no dramatic event to signal
the end of the search and there is no single break-
through that would assure success.
The translation problem is real and will in fact rap-
idly reach crisis proportions unless some action is tak-
en. The problem cannot be alleviated by better lan-
guage teaching, greater incentives for translators, or
improved administrative procedures, worthy though
these goals undoubtedly are. The only hope for a
thoroughgoing solution seems to lie with technology.
But this is not to say that there is only one solution,
namely machine translation, in the classical sense of a
fully automatic procedure that carries a text from one
language to another with human intervention only in
the final revision. There is, in fact, a continuum of
ways in which technology could be brought to bear,
with fully automatic translation at one extreme, and
word-processing equipment and dictating machines at
the other.
The productivity of the professional translator
could almost certainly be greatly increased by techno-
logical aids which, though straightforward, are not all
obvious. Powerful machine aids to translators could
quickly be available and may be the best way to allevi-
ate the translation problem in the short run. They will
not arise as a natural by-product of work on fully au-
tomatic translation because, for the most part, they
address such issues as communication among transla-
tors, identification of relevant secondary material, and
special editing devices, rather than issues of syntactic
analysis, pronominal reference and quantifier scope.
The most valuable resources that a translator has for
solving difficult problems are the text he is working
on, other texts like it in the target as well as the
source language, and his colleagues. At present, ac-
cess to these resources is haphazard at best. But,
improving it immeasurably is well within the scope of
existing technology.
Another easily identifiable point on the continuum
is occupied by human-aided machine translation. This
could be a very different kind of enterprise both from
fully automatic and machine-aided translation. By
human-aided machine translation, we mean to refer to
systems in which the machine, while retaining the initi-
ative, works with a human consultant, who need not
be a translator. Once again, the subtleties in the de-
sign of the system would not reside so much in basic
linguistic questions as in how to recognize reliably
when a difficulty of a certain type had arisen and how
to communicate the nature of the difficulty to the
consultant in such a way as to elicit a quick and unam-
biguous response. Especially in the early stages, a
human-aided machine-translation system intended to
produce output of high quality might well require at
least as much work on the part of the consultant as a
trained translator would take to do the job in the tra-
ditional way. However, two facts can be set against
this. First, the consultant would not have to be a
translator and could quite possibly be drawn from a
much larger segment of the labor pool. Secondly,
while the labor involved in translating a text grows in
direct proportion to the number of languages into
which it must be rendered, the work required of the
consultant in such a man-machine team would grow
much more slowly. Indeed, if those languages were
closely related, it could be expected to fall off sharply
as soon as that number exceeded one.
A substantial proportion of what follows will be
devoted to upholding the panel&apos;s view that it is impor-
tant for work to proceed in parallel on a number of
different fronts. While fully automatic translation is
the most adventurous, it is from this that we stand to
learn most about language in general, and translation
in particular. If fully automatic systems can be built
whose performance exceeds that of present systems by
even a modest amount, we should profit greatly as well

from their practical utility as from the theoretical les-
sons enshrined in them. Machine-aided translation
can enhance the translator&apos;s productivity, though we
have yet to discover how much enhancement is possi-
ble in this way. It could also be a source of invaluable
information on how translators work. Human-aided
machine translation can be expected to give better
results than could be achieved with the fully automatic
method, since the human consultant can be called
upon to resolve otherwise unresolvable problems, but
at an unknown cost. However, there are important
applications, notably where one text must be translat-
ed into several languages, where the gains may be
substantial.
We have been at pains to make it clear that the
three methods of involving machines in language trans-
lation are not essentially different in kind but lie on a
continuum. Except in a few special applications, some
of which we will mention shortly, we do not foresee a
time when translations of any quality will be produced
without any human intervention whatsoever. In the
so-called fully automatic method, the human plays the
role of an editor, or revisor. His involvement begins
only after an initial draft in the target language exists
and it is for this reason that we remain content with
the term &amp;quot;fully automatic&amp;quot;. The other two methods
involve him earlier so that he influences even that first
draft.
The methods therefore differ as to how the person
is involved. They also differ in the extent of his in-
volvement. If the human partner can influence all the
decisions that are made, he may be in a position to
forestall sequences of errors, each resulting from the
one before, thus reducing the total amount of his con-
tribution. On the other hand, if a conservative system
insists on having him confirm even those choices for
which its own decision methods are substantially ade-
quate, then the overall extent of his involvement may
be increased. In any case, the utility of a given system
in a particular situation cannot be assessed by a simple
equation. The appropriate utility function involves at
least the human cost, the machine cost, the quality of
the result, and the nature of the consumer9s require-
ments.
The consumer&apos;s requirements are, of course, cru-
cial. The various types and degrees of automation in
translation are, as we have seen, positioned along one
dimension in a space of possible approaches to the
overall problem. The different types of text and their
consumers are another dimension and, not surprisingly,
the two dimensions are far from independent. The
type of technology appropriate to a problem, and the
benefits to be expected from it, differ greatly with the
type of the text to be translated and the use to which
the result will be put. In the intelligence services, a
great deal of translation is done for purposes of cur-
rent awareness. The first priority is to know the sub-
ject matter of the document. It is also helpful to be
able to discern the gist of the argument so as to dis-
cover whether it touches on certain key questions. A
rough and ready translation, especially if it can be
done quickly and cheaply, may give an excellent basis
on which to decide which parts of a document, if any,
need to be translated more carefully. Fully automatic
translation, even of quite inferior quality, has already
proven very valuable in this role.
Fully automatic translation, or some close relative
of it, has also proved useful in recent years in situa-
tions where a sublanguage has come to be used, or
where one can be readily imposed. Canadian weather
reports are routinely translated by such a system. The
system itself determines whether each translation unit
— approximately a sentence — is within its capabilities.
If it is, then it produces a translation, which is the one
that will be used without human revision. If not, it
presents the translation unit to a human collaborator,
who makes the translation. We prefer to classify this
with fully automatic translation because, though the
machine does not translate everything that is translat-
ed, the translation it does is done entirely without
human involvement even at a post-editing stage. The
machine in fact translates eighty per cent of all trans-
lation units and readers of the reports prove unable to
discern which parts were translated by machine and
which by a human.
The success of this METE° system comes from the
fact that meteorologists naturally write in a highly
constrained subset of English. Fully automatic trans-
lation has also been successfully applied to the task of
translating maintenance manuals for machines. The
success of this does not rest on the existence of a nat-
urally occurring sublanguage. In this case, the techni-
cal writers who prepare the manuals learn to follow a
set of rules intended to ensure that their products will
automatically translatable by simple means. The rules
are straightforward and can be learnt in a two-week
course. The machine translates the whole text without
outside assistance and preliminary results encourage
the belief that little or no editing will be required.
The features of a sublanguage that make it suitable
for fully automatic machine translation are (1) restrict-
ed vocabulary, with consequent reduction in the num-
ber of words with more than one grammatical catego-
ry, (2) small number of senses for each word in a giv-
en category due to the restricted semantic domain, and
(3) restricted syntax resulting from the purpose of the
text, e.g., instruction manuals may contain only imper-
ative sentences and weather reports only declaratives.
It should not be thought, however, that a sublanguage
is simply a subset of the sentences of the standard
language. The syntax of a sublanguage may differ
radically from that of the standard language so that a

grammar of the latter would not cover the construc-
tions of the former. Thus &amp;quot;Fair tommorrow&amp;quot; and
&amp;quot;Winds from the northeast&amp;quot; are &amp;quot;sentences&amp;quot; in a
weather bulletin. There are also closely related do-
mains in which texts have a common syntax, and differ
only in vocabulary. An extensive study of sublanguag-
es, their restrictions and interrelations, will be impor-
tant for determining the range of applications of fully
automatic translation. The question of is a complex
subject to which the report of another panel is devot-

Fully Automatic Machine Translation (FAMT) refers
to translation wherein the programs run in &amp;quot;batch&amp;quot;
mode (off-line) and produce translations without
human intervention; afterwards, human revision
(post-editing) may be performed with a text editing
program or via other means, if desired.
Machine-Assisted Human Translation (MAHT) refers
to translation wherein the program is a fancy edit-
ing and dictionary concordance tool which the hu-
man translator uses to increase his efficiency by
automating his access to word definitions and ter-
minology correspondences. All initiative resides
with the human, unlike FAMT and HAMT.
Information Acquistion refers to a situation in which
translation is being performed for &amp;quot;current
awareness&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;screening&amp;quot; purposes where a quick-
and-dirty approach may be sufficient, at least to
determine if a more careful translation is justified.
No human revision (post-editing) is assumed.
Denotative Translation refers to an information disse-
mination situation in which the everyday and tech-
nical definitions of the words are meant, and where
subtle nuances of a word choice are unjustified or
even undesirable. This is typical of technical texts.
Connotative Translation refers to an information dis-
semination situation in which subtle nuances of
word choice are very important, if not critical, in
conveying the intended meaning of the text. This
is typical of, for example, religious, and literary
texts.
At the opposite end of the spectrum from current-
awareness services are such delicate enterprises as the
translation of legal statutes and political speeches. A
lawyer in Finland can base his arguments either on the
Finnish or the Swedish version of the applicable law,
according to which he considers will most favor his
client&apos;s case. All statutes must be translated and the
translators must be at great pains to ensure that there
is no construction, however perverse, that can be put
on one version but not on the other. We do not fore-
see a time when any part of this job could be usefully
consigned to a fully automatic or even a human-aided,
system. On the other hand, it would be a prime candi-
date for machine-aided methods. There is constant
need to compare one part of the text with others, and
with other legal texts, to ensure consistency, and this
is where these methods come into their own.
If our optimism about the future of mechanical
methods in translation has increased during the twenty
years during which it has been seriously pursued, it
must be largely because of important advances that we
perceive in theoretical and computational linguistics as
well as computer science. Advances in computer sci-
ence are the least contentious of these. The construc-
tion of most large internal memories was not available
and external memory could be accessed only in a serial
manner. The consequent inefficiency in the programs
that were written is less important than the undue
amount of effort that was required to make them work
at all. A machine-translation program was large, even
by today&apos;s standards, and each one produced in the
sixties was a programming tour de force. The achieve-
ments are even more impressive for the fact that they
were made without the aid of the compilers, editors
and other paraphernalia that programmers now take
for granted, and before the great value of certain pro-
gramming practices and disciplines had been recogniz-
ed.
Many of the important advances made in computa-
tional linguistics during the same period also tend to-
wards the easier construction of more robust systems
that can be more readily maintained. The most obvi-
ous examples come from the domain of syntactic anal-
ysis which is now universally thought of as a job to be
done by a fairly general parsing program, coupled with
a grammar. The parser embodies the necessary strate-
gies and techniques while all knowledge of the particu-
lar language resides in a static data structure, namely
the grammar. Associated with the grammar is a formal
language in which a linguist writes rules from which
the data structure is obtained automatically. This
formal language is specially designed to facilitate the
statement of linguistic facts and is largely decoupled
from the grammar itself and from the methods that
will be used to process it. This greatly increases the
power that the linguist can bring to the job and his
ability to modify the system in the light of experience.
In the same period we have come to understand,
not just how a general-purpose parser can be con-
structed, but how to make these parsers more effective
by the application of some very general principles. In
particular, we have come to appreciate the value of the
notions of complete parsing and of nondeterminism.
By complete parsing, we mean simply the requirement
that nothing shall count as part of the final result ex-
cept inasmuch as it is part of an analysis of an entire
sentence. The practical value of this apparently obvi-
ous restriction would be difficult to overestimate. A
parser that incorporates it largely releases the grammar
writer from concern for when it would be incorrect to
allow an analysis that would be correct in another
environment, a concern which consumed much time on
the part of the designers of early translation systems.
General methods for implementing nondeterminism
go together with this and have an equally liberating
effect. These methods are useful in situations where,
at any given stage of the process, a number of con-
flicting possibilities are open, any number of which
could lead to useful results. In particular, a complete
parser, in the present sense, must pursue lines of at-
tack that seem reasonable on the basis of local eviden-

cc, but which may or may not lead to a complete anal-
ysis. A general method for handling nondeterminacy
releases the programmer from all concern for how the
machine will contrive to follow up on all possibilities;
how and when it will return to the choice point and
restore the exact state as of that moment, how it will
follow all possibilities once, but none more than once,
and so forth. To the extent that early translation sys-
tems faced these problems at all, they did so on a case
by case basis, and at great cost in human labor.
The panel was also impressed by the advances that
have been made in general linguistics and our overall
understanding of the workings of human language in
recent years. Various classical problems--noun-noun
compounds in English, ambiguities of prepositional
attachment, conjunction, pronominal reference, and
many others--have been made the object of intensive
research with results that are direct relevance in the
construction of translation systems.
The panel thought it had every reason to assume
that progress on the relevant fronts would go forward
at least as quickly as in the past. Most of the mem-
bers confidently expect to see some major new fully
automatic systems in use during that period. In partic-
ular, it is hoped that EUROTRA, a very large-scale
collaborative European effort, will result in a working
prototype. In addition, there is work in progress in a
number of places on computer-based work stations for
use by translators. It is not clear what these will in-
corporate, but it is likely that they will explore some
new parts of the large space of possibilities that exist
in machine-aided translation.
The panel made no prediction about just which
areas of research were likely to fall before the inexora-
ble advance of theoretical linguistics but felt that the
future of more technological areas was easier to fore-
see. There will, in all probability be more flexible
methods of syntactic analysis, capable of relaxing re-
quirements in the face of constructions that would not
meet with a pundit&apos;s approval. Either they will fall
back on more permissive rules or they will modify the
sentence to &amp;quot;correct&amp;quot; the apparent &amp;quot;error&amp;quot;. It is also
expected that wider use will be made of parsing de-
vices which, while allowing for nondeterminism in a
general way, will be able to make fairly accurate
judgements about the paths that are most likely to lead
to a successful solution, and so concentrate on these
first.
The panel was in agreement on the achievements of
the past and on the desirability of following a number
of parallel paths in the future. The disagreements
concerned the extent of the optimism in future suc-
cesses that those past achievements warrant. Some
members took the view that advances in computer
science and computational linguistics, important
though they are, do not go to the heart of the prob-
lem; they make easier what once was hard but they
make nothing possible that once was impossible. Lin-
guistics has made advances of which it can feel justly
proud but which, while they may indeed go to the
heart of the matter, barely scratch the surface of what
needs to be done.
All agree that it would be unjustifiable to devote an
excessive proportion of the available resources to fully
automatic systems while neglecting cheaper and more
modest approaches with more certain short-term pay-
off. Unless caution is exercised, both in promises
made and policies followed, there is a high risk that
taxpayers and administrators will call all too soon for a
second ALPAC report whose effect on the entire field
of computational linguistics will be altogether more
devastating than the first.
Some members believe that sponsors have grown
more realistic in their expectations, that so long as
they are involved in a continual dialog about the prog-
ress of the work they can be made to understand the
problems, and that they have the fortitude to with-
stand unreasonable pressure from their superiors and
their electors. They no longer, for example, expect
full translations of arbitrary texts, but are content with
texts from suitably restricted domains.
It is claimed earlier in this report, and agreed upon
by all the panel members, that fully automatic transla-
tion is the line of attack whose benefits, if realized,
would be greatest. Futhermore, its success would
contribute greatly to the successes of all other ap-
proaches. The subscribers to this view are impressed
by the extent to which the designers of early systems
were overcome by the sheer complexity of the design
and programming task that they had undertaken so
that the systems they built cannot be taken as a meas-
ure of the technology that linguistics, even the linguis-
tics of that day, could support.

Fully automatic translation, or some close relative of it, has also proved useful in recent years in situations where a sublanguage has come to be used, or where one can be readily imposed. Canadian weather reports are routinely translated by such a system. The system itself determines whether each translation unit — approximately a sentence — is within its capabilities. If it is, then it produces a translation, which is the one that will be used without human revision. If not, it presents the translation unit to a human collaborator, who makes the translation. We prefer to classify this with fully automatic translation because, though the machine does not translate everything that is translated, the translation it does is done entirely without human involvement even at a post-editing stage. The machine in fact translates eighty per cent of all translation units and readers of the reports prove unable to discern which parts were translated by machine and which by a human. The success of this METE° system comes from the fact that meteorologists naturally write in a highly constrained subset of English. Fully automatic translation has also been successfully applied to the task of translating maintenance manuals for machines. The success of this does not rest on the existence of a naturally occurring sublanguage. In this case, the technical writers who prepare the manuals learn to follow a set of rules intended to ensure that their products will automatically translatable by simple means. The rules are straightforward and can be learnt in a two-week course. The machine translates the whole text without outside assistance and preliminary results encourage the belief that little or no editing will be required. The features of a sublanguage that make it suitable for fully automatic machine translation are (1) restricted vocabulary, with consequent reduction in the number of words with more than one grammatical category, (2) small number of senses for each word in a given category due to the restricted semantic domain, and (3) restricted syntax resulting from the purpose of the text, e.g., instruction manuals may contain only imperative sentences and weather reports only declaratives. It should not be thought, however, that a sublanguage is simply a subset of the sentences of the standard language. The syntax of a sublanguage may differ radically from that of the standard language so that a Journal of Computational Linguistics, Volume 8, Number 2, April-June 1982 Martin Kay Machine Translation grammar of the latter would not cover the constructions of the former. Thus &amp;quot;Fair tommorrow&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Winds from the northeast&amp;quot; are &amp;quot;sentences&amp;quot; in a weather bulletin. There are also closely related domains in which texts have a common syntax, and differ only in vocabulary. An extensive study of sublanguagtheir restrictions and interrelations, will be important for determining the range of applications of fully automatic translation. The question of is a complex subject to which the report of another panel is devoted. The following table summarizes our view of the three most interesting points on the continuum.</abstract>

Machine-Assisted Human Translation (MAHT) refers to translation wherein the program is a fancy editing and dictionary concordance tool which the human translator uses to increase his efficiency by automating his access to word definitions and terminology correspondences. All initiative resides the human, unlike Information Acquistion refers to a situation in which translation is being performed for &amp;quot;current awareness&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;screening&amp;quot; purposes where a quickand-dirty approach may be sufficient, at least to determine if a more careful translation is justified. No human revision (post-editing) is assumed. Denotative Translation refers to an information dissemination situation in which the everyday and technical definitions of the words are meant, and where subtle nuances of a word choice are unjustified or even undesirable. This is typical of technical texts. Connotative Translation refers to an information dissemination situation in which subtle nuances of word choice are very important, if not critical, in conveying the intended meaning of the text. This is typical of, for example, religious, and literary texts. opposite end of the spectrum from currentawareness services are such delicate enterprises as the translation of legal statutes and political speeches. A lawyer in Finland can base his arguments either on the Finnish or the Swedish version of the applicable law, according to which he considers will most favor his client&apos;s case. All statutes must be translated and the translators must be at great pains to ensure that there is no construction, however perverse, that can be put on one version but not on the other. We do not foresee a time when any part of this job could be usefully consigned to a fully automatic or even a human-aided, system. On the other hand, it would be a prime candidate for machine-aided methods. There is constant need to compare one part of the text with others, and with other legal texts, to ensure consistency, and this is where these methods come into their own. If our optimism about the future of mechanical methods in translation has increased during the twenty years during which it has been seriously pursued, it must be largely because of important advances that we perceive in theoretical and computational linguistics as well as computer science. Advances in computer science are the least contentious of these. The construction of most large internal memories was not available and external memory could be accessed only in a serial manner. The consequent inefficiency in the programs that were written is less important than the undue amount of effort that was required to make them work at all. A machine-translation program was large, even by today&apos;s standards, and each one produced in the sixties was a programming tour de force. The achievements are even more impressive for the fact that they were made without the aid of the compilers, editors and other paraphernalia that programmers now take for granted, and before the great value of certain programming practices and disciplines had been recognized. Many of the important advances made in computational linguistics during the same period also tend towards the easier construction of more robust systems that can be more readily maintained. The most obvious examples come from the domain of syntactic analysis which is now universally thought of as a job to be done by a fairly general parsing program, coupled with a grammar. The parser embodies the necessary strategies and techniques while all knowledge of the particular language resides in a static data structure, namely the grammar. Associated with the grammar is a formal language in which a linguist writes rules from which the data structure is obtained automatically. This formal language is specially designed to facilitate the statement of linguistic facts and is largely decoupled from the grammar itself and from the methods that will be used to process it. This greatly increases the power that the linguist can bring to the job and his ability to modify the system in the light of experience. In the same period we have come to understand, not just how a general-purpose parser can be constructed, but how to make these parsers more effective by the application of some very general principles. In particular, we have come to appreciate the value of the notions of complete parsing and of nondeterminism. By complete parsing, we mean simply the requirement that nothing shall count as part of the final result except inasmuch as it is part of an analysis of an entire sentence. The practical value of this apparently obvious restriction would be difficult to overestimate. A parser that incorporates it largely releases the grammar writer from concern for when it would be incorrect to allow an analysis that would be correct in another environment, a concern which consumed much time on the part of the designers of early translation systems. General methods for implementing nondeterminism go together with this and have an equally liberating effect. These methods are useful in situations where, at any given stage of the process, a number of conflicting possibilities are open, any number of which could lead to useful results. In particular, a complete parser, in the present sense, must pursue lines of atthat seem reasonable on the basis of local eviden- American Journal of Computational Linguistics, Volume 8, Number 2, April-June 1982 77 Martin Kay Machine Translation cc, but which may or may not lead to a complete analysis. A general method for handling nondeterminacy releases the programmer from all concern for how the machine will contrive to follow up on all possibilities; how and when it will return to the choice point and restore the exact state as of that moment, how it will follow all possibilities once, but none more than once, and so forth. To the extent that early translation systems faced these problems at all, they did so on a case by case basis, and at great cost in human labor. The panel was also impressed by the advances that have been made in general linguistics and our overall understanding of the workings of human language in recent years. Various classical problems--noun-noun compounds in English, ambiguities of prepositional attachment, conjunction, pronominal reference, and many others--have been made the object of intensive research with results that are direct relevance in the construction of translation systems. The panel thought it had every reason to assume that progress on the relevant fronts would go forward at least as quickly as in the past. Most of the members confidently expect to see some major new fully automatic systems in use during that period. In particit is hoped that very large-scale collaborative European effort, will result in a working prototype. In addition, there is work in progress in a number of places on computer-based work stations for use by translators. It is not clear what these will incorporate, but it is likely that they will explore some new parts of the large space of possibilities that exist in machine-aided translation. The panel made no prediction about just which areas of research were likely to fall before the inexorable advance of theoretical linguistics but felt that the future of more technological areas was easier to foresee. There will, in all probability be more flexible methods of syntactic analysis, capable of relaxing requirements in the face of constructions that would not meet with a pundit&apos;s approval. Either they will fall back on more permissive rules or they will modify the sentence to &amp;quot;correct&amp;quot; the apparent &amp;quot;error&amp;quot;. It is also expected that wider use will be made of parsing devices which, while allowing for nondeterminism in a general way, will be able to make fairly accurate judgements about the paths that are most likely to lead to a successful solution, and so concentrate on these first. The panel was in agreement on the achievements of the past and on the desirability of following a number of parallel paths in the future. The disagreements concerned the extent of the optimism in future successes that those past achievements warrant. Some members took the view that advances in computer science and computational linguistics, important though they are, do not go to the heart of the problem; they make easier what once was hard but they make nothing possible that once was impossible. Linguistics has made advances of which it can feel justly proud but which, while they may indeed go to the heart of the matter, barely scratch the surface of what needs to be done. All agree that it would be unjustifiable to devote an excessive proportion of the available resources to fully automatic systems while neglecting cheaper and more modest approaches with more certain short-term payoff. Unless caution is exercised, both in promises made and policies followed, there is a high risk that taxpayers and administrators will call all too soon for a whose effect on the entire field of computational linguistics will be altogether more devastating than the first. Some members believe that sponsors have grown more realistic in their expectations, that so long as they are involved in a continual dialog about the progress of the work they can be made to understand the problems, and that they have the fortitude to withstand unreasonable pressure from their superiors and their electors. They no longer, for example, expect full translations of arbitrary texts, but are content with texts from suitably restricted domains. It is claimed earlier in this report, and agreed upon by all the panel members, that fully automatic translation is the line of attack whose benefits, if realized, would be greatest. Futhermore, its success would contribute greatly to the successes of all other approaches. The subscribers to this view are impressed by the extent to which the designers of early systems were overcome by the sheer complexity of the design and programming task that they had undertaken so that the systems they built cannot be taken as a measure of the technology that linguistics, even the linguistics of that day, could support.</abstract>
