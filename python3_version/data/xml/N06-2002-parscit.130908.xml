Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999965695652174">
This paper describes a small, struc-
tured English corpus that is
designed for translation into Less
Commonly Taught Languages
(LCTLs), and a set of re-usable
tools for creation of similar cor-
pora. 1 The corpus systematically
explores meanings that are known to
affect morphology or syntax in the
world’s languages. Each sentence
is associated with a feature structure
showing the elements of meaning
that are represented in the sentence.
The corpus is highly structured so
that it can support machine learning
with only a small amount of data.
As part of the REFLEX program,
the corpus will be translated into
multiple LCTLs, resulting in paral-
lel corpora can be used for training
of MT and other language technolo-
gies. Only the untranslated English
corpus is described in this paper.

are efforts to build language packs for Less
Commonly Taught Languages (LCTLs).
Each language pack includes parallel cor-
pora consisting of naturally occurring text
translated from English into the LCTL or
vice versa.
This paper describes a small corpus
that supplements naturally occurring text
with highly systematic enumeration of
meanings that are known to affect morphol-
ogy and syntax in the world’s languages.
The supplemental corpus will enable the
exploration of constructions that are sparse
or obscured in natural data. The corpus
consists of 12,875 English sentences, total-
ing 76,202 word tokens.
This paper describes the construc-
tion of the corpus, including tools and
resources that can be used for the construc-
tion of similar corpora.

The MILE (Minor Language Elicitation)
corpus is a highly structured set of English
sentences. Each sentence represents a
meaning or combination of meanings that
we want to elicit from a speaker of an
LCTL. For example, the corpus excerpts
in Figure 1 explore quoted and non quoted
sentential complements, embedded ques-
tions, negation, definiteness, biological
gender, and possessive noun phrases.
Underlying each sentence is a feature
structure that serves to codify its meaning.
Additionally, sentences are accompanied by
a context field that provides information that
may be present in the feature structure, but
not inherent in the English sentence. For
example, in Figure 2, the feature structure
specifies solidarity with the hearer and
power relationship of the speaker and hearer,
as evidenced by the features-value pairs (c-
solidarity solidarity-neutral) and (c-power-
relationship power-peer). Because this is
not an inherent part of English grammar, this
aspect of meaning is conveyed in the context
field.

3 Building the Corpus
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99935855">
Figure 3 shows the steps in creating the
corpus. Corpus creation is driven by a Fea-
ture Specification. The Feature
Specification defines features such as tense,
person, and number, and values for each
feature such past, present, future, remote
past, recent past, for tense. Additionally,
the feature specification defines illegal com-
binations of features, such as the use of a
singular number with an inclusive or exclu-
sive pronoun (We = you and me vs we = me
and other people). The inventory of fea-
tures and values is informed by typological
studies of which elements of meaning are
known to affect syntax and morphology in
some of the world’s languages. The feature
specification currently contains 42 features
and 340 values and covers. In order to select
the most relevant features we drew guidance
from Comrie and Smith (1977) and Bouqui-
aux and Thomas (1992). We also used the
World Atlas of Language Structures
(Haspelmath et al. 2005) as a catalog of ex-
isting language features and their prevalence.
In the process of corpus creation, feature
structures are created before their corre-
sponding English sentences. There are
three reasons for this. First, as mentioned
above, the feature structure may contain
elements of meaning that are not explicitly
represented in the English sentence. Sec-
ond, multiple elicitation languages can be
generated from the same set of feature struc-
tures. For example, when we elicit South
American languages we use Spanish instead
of English sentences. Third, what we want
to know about each LCTL is not how it
translates the structural elements of English
such as determiners and auxiliary verbs, but
how it renders certain meanings such as

definiteness, tense, and modality, which are
not in one-to-one correspondence with Eng-
lish words.
Creation of feature structures takes place
in two steps. First, we define which com-
binations of features and values are of
interest. Then the feature structures are
automatically created from the feature speci-
fication.
Combinations of features are specified
in Feature Maps (Figure 3). These maps
identify features that are known to interact
syntactically or morphologically in some
languages. For example, tense in English
is partially expressed using the auxiliary
verb system. An unrelated aspect of mean-
ing, whether a sentence is declarative or
interrogative, interacts with the tense system
in that it affects the word order of auxiliary
verbs (He was running, Was he running),
Thus there is an interaction of tense with
interrogativity. We use studies of lan-
guage typology to identify combinations of
features that are known to interact.
Feature Maps are written in a concise
formalism that is automatically expanded
into a set of feature structures. For exam-
ple, we can formally specify that we want
three values of tense combined with three
values of person, and nine feature structures
will be produced. These are shown as Fea-
ture Structure Sets in Figure 3.

4 Sentence Writing
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999942578947368">
As stated previously, our corpus
consists of feature structures that have been
human annotated with a sentence and con-
text field. Our feature structures contain
functional-typological information, but do
not contain specific lexical items. This
means that our set of feature structures can
be interpreted into any language using ap-
propriate word choices and used for
elicitation. Additionally, this leaves the
human annotator with some freedom when
selecting vocabulary items. Due to feed-
back from previous elicitation subjects we
chose basic vocabulary words while steering
clear of overly primitive subject matter that
may be seen as insulting. Moreover, we
did our best to avoid lexical gaps; for exam-
ple, many languages do not have a single
word that means winner.

<bodyText confidence="0.999927571428571">
Translator accuracy was also an im-
portant objective and we took pains to
construct natural sounding, unambiguous
sentences. The context field is used to
clarify the sentence meaning and spell out
features that may not manifest themselves in
English.

5 Tools
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.947623909090909">
In conjunction with this project we
created several tools that can be reused to
make new corpora with other purposes.
■ An XML schema and XSLT can be used
to make different feature specifications
■ A feature structure generator that can be
used as a guide to specify and design
feature maps
■ A feature structure browser can be used
to make complicated feature structures
easier to read and annotate

6 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9937235">
The basic steps for creating a func-
tional-typological corpus are:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.855668">
1. Combinations of features are selected
2. Sets of feature structures representing all
feature combinations are generated
3. Humans write sentences with basic vo-
cabulary that represent the meaning in
the feature structure
4. If the corpus is too large, some or all of
the corpus can be sampled
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999988242424242">
We used sampling and assessments of
the most crucial features in order to compile
our corpus and restrict it to a size small
enough to be translatable by humans. As a
result it is possible that this corpus will miss
important feature combinations in some lan-
guages. However, a corpus containing all
possible combinations of features would
produce hundreds of billions of feature
structures.
Our future research includes building a
Corpus Navigation System to dynamically
explore the full feature space. Using ma-
chine learning we will use information de-
tected from translated sentences in order to
decide what parts of the feature space are
redundant and what parts must be explored
and translated next. A further description of
this process can be read in Levin et al.
(2006).
Additionally, we will change from using
humans to write sentences and context fields
to having them generated by using a natural
language generation system (Alvarez et al.
2005).
We also ran small scale experiments to
measure translator accuracy and consistency
and encountered positive results. Hebrew
and Japanese translators provided consistent,
accurate translations. Large scale experi-
ments will be conducted in the near future to
see if the success of the smaller experiments
will carry over to a larger scale.
