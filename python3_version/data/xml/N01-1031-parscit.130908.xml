<bodyText confidence="0.999856684210527">
Native and non-native use of language differs, de-
pending on the proficiency of the speaker, in clear
and quantifiable ways. It has been shown that cus-
tomizing the acoustic and language models of a natu-
ral language understanding system can significantly
improve handling of non-native input; in order to
make such a switch, however, the nativeness status
of the user must be known. In this paper, we show
that naive Bayes classification can be used to iden-
tify non-native utterances of English. The advan-
tage of our method is that it relies on text, not on
acoustic features, and can be used when the acoustic
source is not available. We demonstrate that both
read and spontaneous utterances can be classified
with high accuracy, and that classification of errorful
speech recognizer hypotheses is more accurate than
classification of perfect transcriptions. We also char-
acterize part-of-speech sequences that play a role in
detecting non-native speech.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999851000000001">
Native speakers, while deeply individual in their use
of language, share intuitions about the meaning and
cadence of speech that come from many years of us-
ing it as the primary means of communication. Se-
lection of the words that best express an idea in
speech is often nearly instantaneous, yet is influ-
enced by a complex collection of factors, including
collocational conventions, rhythm, register, and se-
mantic and pragmatic context. Variability notwith-
standing, one might expect to find patterns in native
speech that mark it as native.
For non-native speakers who are still learning a
language, the production of meaningful speech is an
entirely different task. In addition to the mechani-
cal difficulties of pronouncing unfamiliar words, such
obstacles as limited access to lexical terms and lack
of intuition about the syntactic and semantic in-
tegrity of an utterance hinder non-native speakers
in their efforts to speak.
The question that we seek to answer in this paper
is whether native and non-native utterances of En-
glish are sufficiently distinct in character that they
can be classified using statistical methods, namely
naive Bayes classification.
Naive Bayes classifiers are often used to classify
documents according to topic (Lewis, 1998). The
classification of test documents is based on the prob-
ability of finding individual features (words) in the
class based on the training set. Naive Bayes clas-
sifiers work well in combining the contributions of
individual words across a large vocabulary, and also
take into account the overall class probability. They
compare favorably to other classification techniques
when the class distributions are not radically skewed
(Yang and Liu, 1999).
Machine learning techniques have also been used
to categorize documents according to publication of
origin, e.g., whether an article is likely to have ap-
peared in Time or Newsweek. Source classification
can be a more difficult problem than topic classifi-
cation because the decision must be based on sub-
tle differences in how words are used, not which
words are most common. Content is determined
by current affairs, which are common across the
media in a given time-frame, whereas stylistic con-
cerns are shaped by habits and preferences of the
individual writers and editors. One might expect
these kinds of effects to hold true for non-native
speech detection, where the topics of speech are
similar across speakers, but realization is different.
These expectations have been formalized in such
theories as transitional competence (Corder, 1967)
and interlanguage (Tarone, 1978). It was shown
in (Argamon-Engelson et al., 1998) that a docu-
ment can be identified as coming from Time, The
Doily News, Newsweek, Times editorials, or Times
news using a decision-tree-based approach. Impor-
tantly, the features used here consisted of function
words, which are commonly filtered out during fea-
ture selection for content-based classification. They
also used part-of-speech tags as features in their
classifier, suggesting that patterns of word use are
more important in this task than the words them-
selves. Mosteller and Wallace (1984) showed that
using Bayesian inference on function words can be
effective for author identification.
Nativeness classification based on acoustic fea-
tures has been used to detect foreign accents.
Fung and Liu (1999) trained a hidden Markov
model (HMM) to discriminate between native and
Cantonese-accented English using energy and for-
mant characteristics. Teixeira, Trancoso, and Ser-
ralheiro (1996) also used HMMs in a 6-way accent
identification task, training a full set of accented
acoustic models for each language pair, recogniz-
ing using each set of models in parallel, and choos-
ing the model set with the highest acoustic score.
Acoustically-derived classification, however, requires
access to the acoustic features, which may not be
readily available.
In this paper, we investigate classification of text
as native or non-native. A text-derived classifica-
tion result may be used as part of a feedback sys-
tem in a speech recognizer: if the recognizer output
fits a non-native profile, the utterance can be re-
recognized with customized acoustic models or a cus-
tomized lexicon. Text-based classification is appro-
priate if the recognition component is to be treated
like a black box in a natural language understanding
system; customized parsing and dialogue modeling
can be invoked if the recognizer hypothesis indicates
that the speaker is non-native. It may also be useful
to consider nativeness in language modeling. Lan-
guage model training text can be tagged as native
or non-native when the model is built, and the role
of the language model or models in the search can
be modified if the initial hypothesis flags the speaker
as non-native. Finally, text-based classification can
be used to determine whether the author of a piece
of text, such as an electronic mail message or a web
page, is a native speaker; this information may con-
tribute to improved parsing or information extrac-
tion.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we
describe our target users and the speech data that
was collected from them. The transcription proto-
col is also discussed here. In Section 3 we provide an
overview of naive Bayes classification, the software
that was used in our research, our text preparation
and features used in the classifier. In Section 4 we
describe our experimental methodology. Experimen-
tal results are presented in Section 5, with a discus-
sion in Section 6.

In this section we detail the speech data used for our
experiments. We describe the native and non-native
speakers who were recorded, the recording condi-

used in our experiments.

2.1 Speakers
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999979666666667">
It was our aim to choose speakers who must use En-
glish on a daily basis to communicate with colleagues
and classmates but who experience significant diffi-
culty in speaking it. These are potential users of
natural language understanding systems who may
be frustrated by the system&apos;s inability to adapt to
non-native speech of their level.
45 speakers were recorded for this study. Of these,
31 were native speakers of Japanese, 8 were na-
tive speakers of English, and 6 were native speak-
ers of Chinese. Non-native speakers were selected
for length of time studying English in their home
country (6 to 8 years), length of time in an English
immersion environment (6 to 12 months), and self-
reported comfort speaking English (3 on a scale of
5). Additionally, speakers were given a proficiency
test (SPE, 1987) and a subset of 10 speakers with
similar scores was chosen for controlled experiments.

2.2 Task and recording
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998935">
All recording was done in a quiet room using a
close-talking microphone. Speakers were alone in
the room while recording. Both read and sponta-
neous speech were collected.

2.2.1 Read speech
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999953416666667">
For the read speech task, speakers read three arti-
cles of children&apos;s news; these selections were similar
in content to common speech databases such as Wall
Street Journal (LDC, 2000) but had a reduced vo-
cabulary and lower difficulty that was better suited
to our speakers. Of the three articles that each
speaker read, one was read by all speakers, and the
other two were read only by that speaker. The arti-
cles averaged 50 sentences, comprising around 1400
words, in length. The read speech task was per-
formed by the native speakers and the proficiency-
controlled subset of the Japanese speakers.

<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.714714">
2.2.2 Spontaneous speech
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999974666666667">
All speakers performed a spontaneous task in the
tourist domain. Speakers were prompted in their na-
tive language with sights and activities they might
find interesting, and were instructed to ask questions
of an agent about how to see or accomplish them.
This is similar to the elicitation approach described
in (Mayfield Tomokiyo and Burger, 1999). Conver-
sations averaged 54 turns, with just over 1000 words
per speaker.

All recorded data was transcribed and verified by
separate annotators. Transcription conventions fol-
lowed those used by the Linguistic Data Consortium

Recognizer hypotheses for the read and spontaneous
speech recordings were produced by an HMM-based
large vocabulary continuous speech recognition sys-

rate of this system on Broadcast News FO data with
trained newsreaders is 9.4%.

3 Naive Bayes Classification
</sectionHeader>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997662">
3.1 Overview
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999468142857143">
A Naive Bayes classifier incorporates information
about statistical priors on the target classes as well
as the features present in each example. A test ex-
ample is classified by assigning it to the class cal-
culated as most likely to have produced it. For an
utterance u which may assigned to a class c, its score
is calculated as follows:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.996847">
P (OP NC)
(CIU) ()
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.99960875">
When choosing between classes, we need not calcu-
late the probability directly, since we want only to
find the maximum score, and P() is constant across
classes.
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.863755">
argmax„ P (cilu) = argmax,P (ci)P
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999487928571429">
Now, we have insufficient data to reliably estimate
the probability of every possible utterance for arbi-
trary native and non-native speakers, since this set
is infinite. Even simplifying to sequences of POS-
tags will not permit completely reliable estimation
of probabilities of utterances. Instead, we treat ut-
terances as consisting of an unordered set of inde-
pendently occurring features. Though this indepen-
dence assumption may not be statistically true, it
has been shown that for classification this kind of
assumption does not substantially harm accuracy
(Lewis, 1998; Domingos and Pazzani, 1997).
Thus for an utterance with features fj...fn we can

Our features consisted of all word pairs, in some
cases word triples, and all of their constituent words.
These word sequences will be referred to as uni-
grams, bigrams, and trigrams in this paper.

3.2 Text classification toolkit

<bodyText confidence="0.9999822">
The Rainbow statistical text classification package
(McCallum, 1996) was used for all classification ex-
periments. Rainbow implements a Naive Bayes clas-
sifier for text, with a number of features specialized
for text applications.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.98911">
3.3 Text Preparation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999848">
Since all documents were based on speech, no capi-
talization or punctuation was available. We treated
spaces and the contraction-marking apostrophe as
word separators, and included all unigrams and all
bigrams as independent features. Trigrams were also
used in some experiments. Calculation of proba-
bilities was based on a multinomial event model,
where feature probability is based on frequencies
within documents, rather than just binary occur-
rence statistics.

3.4 Part-of-speech tagging
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999981333333333">
In some of the experiments we will describe, part-
of-speech tags are used as input to the classifier in-
stead of words. Part-of-speech tags were produced
by the MXPOST toolkit (Ratnaparkhi, 1996). Bi-
grams and trigrams over the POS-tags were also
used, as described above.

4 Experimental Design
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999981095238095">
The task of learning distinctive features of native-
ness in text was framed as a document classification
problem. That is, each article read by a speaker,
or all of a speaker&apos;s side of each conversation, was
treated as a unique document. Training data con-
sisted of a set of documents labeled as native and
set of documents labeled as non-native (for non-
binary classification tasks documents were labeled
with the speaker&apos;s native language). The classifier&apos;s
task, then, was to build from the training docu-
ments a model of patterns distinguishing native and
non-native language and use that model to make
judgements about the nativeness of new documents.
Training and test sets never contained the same
speaker, and there was never more than one docu-
ment from an individual speaker in a training or test
set. Where training and test documents were from
identical conditions (shared or unique, described be-
low), we used 70% of documents for training, 30% for
testing, with 20 random train-test splits, and with
results averaged over the 20 runs.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.996531">
4.1 Read speech
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99985158974359">
Although one might not expect read speech to vary
from speaker to speaker, particularly when the text
is the same, our preliminary investigations suggested
that there are actually significant differences in the
types of reading errors native and non-native speak-
ers make that can be described with statistical mea-
sures such as perplexity and Kullback-Leibler diver-
gence. Because our target speakers have had exten-
sive exposure to written language but little experi-
ence with conversation, a read speech task represents
a far lighter cognitive load than a spontaneous task.
Errors in reading, then, might be considered more
representative of fundamental differences in the lin-
guistic models of native and non-native speakers,
and as such strong bases for classifier training.
The proficiency-controlled subset of Japanese
speakers was used in read speech classification. Ar-
ticles from these speakers were contrasted with arti-
cles from eight native speakers.
As was described in Section 2.2, each speaker read
three articles, one of which was common to all speak-
ers, and two of which were read only by that speaker.
Because the shared articles are all realized slightly
differently, they provide a unique source of training
and test data. There will be no distributional bias of
lexical items, since the source text was all the same,
so a classification decision will be based only on the
character of reading errors.
While the shared articles are a valuable source of
data, accurate classification of one article may not
mean that the model will generalize to other articles.
The unique articles read by each speaker are more
representative of conventional document classifica-
tion training and testing data, in which documents
may share a topic or author or genre but are not
transformations of a single base text.
With these considerations in mind, we defined four
types of evaluation to determine in which situations
detection of non-nativeness may be appropriate:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.86682475">
(A) train on shared article, test on shared article
(B) train on unique articles, test on unique articles
(C) train on shared article, test on unique article
(D) train on unique articles, test on shared articles
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998760533333333">
In (A), classification is based only on individual
differences and is minimally affected by the base
text. In (B), the model will be general, but it may
be difficult to construct a useful model because dif-
ferences in the base texts may overpower the subtle
differences in native and non-native language, and
we have less data available for building the model.
In (C), a very specific model of reading errors in cer-
tain contexts will be built, but testing on different
articles may show that the model does not gener-
alize. Finally, in (D), a general model will be built,
and successful classification of the shared article will
show that the classifier is modeling nativeness, and
not topic or lexicon, but may be open to concerns
about external validity.

4.1.1 Working from transcripts
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999508384615385">
In the experiments described in this paper, we evalu-
ated classification of both human-transcribed speech
(transcripts) and the output of automatic speech
recognition (recognizer hypotheses). This is a com-
mon practice in evaluations of systems that include a
recognition component, as the recognizer is typically
seen as an introducer of noise and researchers would
like to establish both the performance of the work-
ing end-to-end system and the performance individ-
ual components would reach given perfect recogni-
tion. Performance on transcripts, then, is seen as a
gold standard: the &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; accuracy of the module in
question.

<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.770464">
4.1.2 Working from recognizer output
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999996925925926">
As our goal is to incorporate nativeness classifica-
tions in a spoken language understanding system, we
produced recognizer hypotheses for each read sen-
tence and created recognizer output &amp;quot;documents&amp;quot;
for each article. The word error rate (WER) for this
task was 21% for the native speakers and 58% for
the non-native speakers. WER is a measure which
combines the results of word insertion, deletion and
substitution (Lee, 1990) when the recognizer hy-
potheses are compared to the transcripts. An ideal
speech recognizer would have a word-error rate of
0%. These system WER figures represent recog-
nizer performance with speaker adaptation but with-
out any specialized non-native acoustic or language
modeling, as the system would not know whether
the speaker was native or non-native at the time of
classification.
Although any differences between the native and
non-native hypotheses should be fair game for clas-
sification, it is valuable to establish whether there
is something special about the way the recognizer is
recognizing non-native speech, or whether the clas-
sifier is only picking up on the higher word error.
Therefore, we produced a second set of hypotheses
for the shared article in which WER was artificially
increased by adding white noise to the speech signal.
The error rate of these hypotheses was 56%.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.988472">
4.2 Spontaneous speech
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999930894736842">
For spontaneous speech experiments, we used the
full set of 31 Japanese, 6 Chinese, and 8 native En-
glish speakers. All speakers were executing the task
described in Section 2.2, namely, asking an agent
questions about sightseeing in a specified city. In
this respect, the data is all compatible. However,
there was some overlap in the proper nouns (names
of sights, cities, restaurants, and the like) that ap-
peared in the data. In order to ensure that the clas-
sifier was not modeling distribution of place names,
we repeated all classification experiments using part-
of-speech tags instead of word tokens.
With data from three native speaker groups avail-
able, we were able to evaluate 3-way classification
accuracy, as well as binary classification with more
than one native speaker group represented in the
non-native data. Additionally, we tested binary clas-
sification accuracy of Chinese and Japanese speak-
ers.

itself. It may be the case that non-native utterance
detection will also perform well with vocabulary re-
stricted to stopwords, or some other kind of feature
selection. So while most of our experiments used
no feature selection and included all stopwords, we
also experimented with two forms of feature selec-
tion: pre-filtering of vocabulary by restricting it to
words on one of several standard stopword lists; and
feature selection by information gain score (Quin-
lan, 1986). We compared restricting the vocabulary
to that from three stopword lists: the short SMART
stopword list (48 words) the long SMART stopword
list (524 words), and Mosteller and Wallace&apos;s (1984)
first 70 function words. When performing feature se-
lection by information gain, the top-ranking features
were selected according to their information gain on
the training set, for each train-test split.

Baselines are 83% for 2-way native/Japanese and Chi-
nese/Japanese decisions, 72% for a 2-way native/non-
native decision with Chinese speakers included in the
non-native set, and 72% for a 3-way decision. Trigrams
were only used where marked with (n &lt; 3)
recognizer hypotheses part-of-speech tokens outper-
form word tokens. The most surprising observation
is that classification accuracy of recognizer hypothe-
ses, both word and part-of-speech, is extremely high.
Because the classification accuracy decreases when
the native signal is corrupted to yield similar word
error rates, we can infer that the classifier is learn-
ing something about the character of poorly recog-
nized utterances that helps to identify non-native
utterances. The fact that classification accuracy is
still significantly higher than chance for the WER-
matched condition, however, suggests that there is
something special about the way non-native utter-
ances are recognized, irrespective of overall recog-
nizer performance.
Table 2 shows classification results for read speech.
The baseline accuracy of this task (calculated by
always picking the speaker set best represented in
the training data) is 83% for 2-way native/Japanese
and Chinese/Japanese decisions, 72% for a 2-way
native/non-native decision with Chinese speakers in-
cluded in the non-native set, and 72% for a 3-way
decision.
Classification accuracy with words is very high in
all cases. However, this is to a large extent due to
proper nouns that occur in only one speaker set.
Classification performance on part-of-speech tags is
a stronger indicator of how well linguistic, and not
topic, differences are being modeled; however, re-
placing all words with part-of-speech tags would
hide differences in which verbs or verb-preposition
sequences, for example, the speakers choose. We
therefore ran a third experiment replacing only
nouns (proper and not) with their parts of speech.
Results from this experiment are given in the last
column of Table 2, and show that this formulation
of the classification task results in accuracies as high
or higher than word-based classification while avoid-
ing the risk of overtraining to the topic or task.

For most of the experiments described in this pa-
per, only unigrams and bigrams were used in classifi-
cation. This was because of the small size of the data
set. Although the part-of-speech data contained far
fewer unique word types and could support trigram
modeling, we did not find that including trigrams
resulted in significantly improved classification in
most cases. For the spontaneous case, however, we
did observe a difference in performance when the
non-native document set was extended to include
native speakers of Chinese. Results with trigrams
are marked with (n &lt; 3).

<bodyText confidence="0.99994425">
For the feature selection experiments we used the
mixed condition speech hypotheses, and found that
feature selection can greatly improve classification
accuracy for this most difficult condition, as shown
in Table 3. Note that reducing vocabulary size by
performing feature selection by information gain im-
proves classification accuracy. However, restrict-
ing the vocabulary to stopwords from one of the
SMART lists or Mosteller and Wallace&apos;s list has a
much greater effect for the same vocabulary size.
Different stopword lists performed equivalently, and
performing further feature selection on the restricted
vocabulary using information gain did not improve
performance. The results shown here are for uni-
grams, which consistently performed better than bi-
grams when the vocabulary was restricted.

We have found that transcriptions of spontaneous
speech can be classified with high accuracy for both
binary (native/non-native) and 3-way decisions. We
have also found that read speech samples, which are
all simple transformations of native-produced text,
can be classified as native or non-native, and that
recognizer output is classified more accurately than
transcripts. To understand these results, it is helpful

Tables 4 and 5 show the words and parts of speech,
respectively, that were important in discriminating
between native and non-native transcripts of the
shared article, sorted by log-odds score. The top
word indicating native speech was NMFS, which was
an acronym for the National Marine Fisheries Ser-
vice. The native speakers always read this smoothly,
while the non-native speakers often repeated and
misread letters. The top n-gram for the non-native
speakers, on the other hand, was a repetition of the
determiner the. Non-native speakers frequently re-
peated words in their reading, possibly because they
were unfamiliar with the next word. The term nine-
teen hundreds also played an important role in iden-
tifying native speech. This token was written in nu-
merals in the text (1900s), and non-native speakers
often did not know how to read it aloud. Whether
a speaker read habitats or habitat (the correct word
was habitats) was another clue to nativeness class.
Reading errors involving singular-plural confusion
were extremely common in the non-native speech,
and relatively rare in the native speech.
The singular-plural distinction was also important
in discriminating based on part of speech. A large
number of plural nouns was found to be the primary
indicator of nativeness. It is important to keep in
mind at this point that speakers were all reading the
same article, so the higher frequency of plural nouns
does not necessarily indicate a preference on the part
of native speakers for plural nouns, but rather a ten-

6.2 Recognizer hypotheses of read speech
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999766">
Tables 6 and 7 show the important word and part-of-
speech n-grams in discriminating between recognizer
hypotheses of the shared read article. The most
striking difference, and the one most encouraging for
further work in classification of recognizer output, is
the word salmon. This was an article about salmon
populations, so this token appeared many times. In
the native speech, it was generally recognized cor-
rectly. In the non-native speech, however, it was
usually not, but was rather misrecognized as some,
someone, and simon, among other words. Misrecog-
nized native productions of the word salmon, on the
other hand, did not tend to be misrecognized this
way, but rather as the plural salmons, which, inci-
dentally, is not the correct plural form and did not
appear in the article but was allowed in the search
because it was produced on occasion by non-native
speakers.
Turning to the part-of-speech-based classification
(Table 7), we can see that plural nouns continue
to play a role in nativeness decisions. This is true
for the noisy native data set as well as the baseline
native data set. The top token on the non-native
list is the past tense verb. It is not obvious why
this form is so indicative of non-native speech. Past
tense verbs also help to identify non-native speech in
transcripts, indicating that non-native speakers are
indeed on occasion reading past tense forms inappro-
priately, but the association is much stronger in the
recognizer output. Our hypothesis is that the non-

6.3 Spontaneous speech
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999982592592593">
Discriminative tokens for spontaneous speech are
given in Tables 8 and 9. The word tokens include to-
kens representing singular, plural, and proper nouns,
avoiding overtraining on specific place names as dis-
cussed in Section 5. Because this is spontaneous
speech, we are no longer looking at reading errors,
but rather genuine preferences in word usage for the
different speaker groups. The non-native data set
consists of speakers of both Chinese and Japanese.
Nouns, specifically singular, non-proper nouns,
are a strong indicator of non-nativeness. We have
observed a tendency on the part of the non-native
speakers to form sentences around noun phrases,
saying, for example, what is the price of the ticket of
the show where a native speaker might say how much
does the show cost. Native speakers use more per-
sonal pronouns in their queries to the agent, as evi-
denced both by the importance of the personal pro-
noun in the part-of-speech-based classification and
related verb forms like am. Sentences like I&apos;m inter-
ested in seeing the Empire State Building, can you
give me more information are common in the na-
tive data, where non-native speakers showed a strong
preference for simple constructions like how do I go
to the Empire State Building. This tendency also
partly explains the importance of wh-adverbs (how,
when, where, why) in identifying non-native speech.

6.4 Generalization to new data
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999986913043478">
It is clear from the results in Table 1 that the penalty
for training and test condition mismatch in classifi-
cation of read speech is very high. While it is pos-
sible to learn, from different renditions of a single
article, a model that can classify new renditions of
that same article as native or non-native, that model
cannot be used, at least in this limited framework,
to classify new articles — in the case of transcrip-
tions. It appears, however, that one can build a
model that will generalize to new data when process-
ing recognizer output. Even when training and test-
ing on all unique articles, a condition in which a use-
ful model is not learned from transcriptions, when
working with recognizer output a model is learned
that performs significantly better than chance.
This was an unexpected and encouraging result.
Because the recognizer is often viewed as a noisy
channel, it was thought that some of the features
that mark nativeness would be lost during speech
recognition. It would appear, however, that classi-
fication of recognizer hypotheses is actually an eas-
ier task than classification of manually verified tran-
scriptions.

7 Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999989772727273">
Based on the promising results on classification of
text, we are looking at ways of incorporating this
with existing techniques for identifying non-native
speakers based on acoustic features, with the goal
of obtaining even greater reliability from combin-
ing the two. A speech recognition system that can
automatically determine whether a speaker is na-
tive or non-native, and appropriately adjust mod-
els, would ideally perform this adjustment on the
fly. Thus we would also like to explore minimizing
the number of words needed to be spoken before the
system can identify nativeness. We are also inter-
ested in exploring a comparison between naive Bayes
and language model based classification; initial ex-
periments suggested that perplexity on a standard
backoff language model may be a good discriminator
for transcripts (although not as good for hypotheses,
which implicitly contain some language model infor-
mation). Finally, it may be helpful to apply some of
the features discovered in this work to the problem
of identifying native and non-native writing, which
may be of relevance to writer identification.

<abstract confidence="0.99897775">Native and non-native use of language differs, depending on the proficiency of the speaker, in clear and quantifiable ways. It has been shown that customizing the acoustic and language models of a natural language understanding system can significantly improve handling of non-native input; in order to make such a switch, however, the nativeness status of the user must be known. In this paper, we show that naive Bayes classification can be used to identify non-native utterances of English. The advantage of our method is that it relies on text, not on acoustic features, and can be used when the acoustic source is not available. We demonstrate that both read and spontaneous utterances can be classified with high accuracy, and that classification of errorful recognizer hypotheses is than classification of perfect transcriptions. We also characterize part-of-speech sequences that play a role in detecting non-native speech.</abstract>

Of the three articles that each speaker read, one was read by all speakers, and the other two were read only by that speaker.

The word error rate (WER) for this task was 21% for the native speakers and 58% for the non-native speakers. WER is a measure which combines the results of word insertion, deletion and substitution (Lee, 1990) when the recognizer hypotheses are compared to the transcripts. An ideal speech recognizer would have a word-error rate of 0%. These system WER figures represent recognizer performance with speaker adaptation but without any specialized non-native acoustic or language modeling, as the system would not know whether the speaker was native or non-native at the time of classification. Although any differences between the native and non-native hypotheses should be fair game for classification, it is valuable to establish whether there is something special about the way the recognizer is recognizin</context>

In addition to the mechanical difficulties of pronouncing unfamiliar words, such obstacles as limited access to lexical terms and lack of intuition about the syntactic and semantic integrity of an utterance hinder non-native speakers in their efforts to speak. The question that we seek to answer in this paper is whether native and non-native utterances of English are sufficiently distinct in character that they can be classified using statistical methods, namely naive Bayes classification. Naive Bayes classifiers are often used to classify documents according to topic (Lewis, 1998). The classification of test documents is based on the probability of finding individual features (words) in the class based on the training set. Naive Bayes classifiers work well in combining the contributions of individual words across a large vocabulary, and also take into account the overall class probability. They compare favorably to other classification techniques when the class distributions are not radically skewed (Yang and Liu, 1999). Machine learning techniques have also been used to categorize documents according to publication of origin, e.g., whether an article is likely to have</context>

Even simplifying to sequences of POStags will not permit completely reliable estimation of probabilities of utterances. Instead, we treat utterances as consisting of an unordered set of independently occurring features. Though this independence assumption may not be statistically true, it has been shown that for classification this kind of assumption does not substantially harm accuracy (Lewis, 1998; Domingos and Pazzani, 1997).

The articles averaged 50 sentences, comprising around 1400 words, in length. The read speech task was performed by the native speakers and the proficiencycontrolled subset of the Japanese speakers. 2.2.2 Spontaneous speech All speakers performed a spontaneous task in the tourist domain. Speakers were prompted in their native language with sights and activities they might find interesting, and were instructed to ask questions of an agent about how to see or accomplish them. This is similar to the elicitation approach described in (Mayfield Tomokiyo and Burger, 1999). Conversations averaged 54 turns, with just over 1000 words per speaker. 2.3 Transcription All recorded data was transcribed and verified by separate annotators. Transcription conventions followed those used by the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) in transcription of CALLHOME (LDC, 2000) with some extensions to support annotation of deviation from read text and non-native disfluencies. 2.4 Recognition Recognizer hypotheses for the read and spontaneous speech recordings were produced by an HMM-based large vocabulary continuous speech recognition system (Finke et al., 1997).

Importantly, the features used here consisted of function words, which are commonly filtered out during feature selection for content-based classification. They also used part-of-speech tags as features in their classifier, suggesting that patterns of word use are more important in this task than the words themselves. Mosteller and Wallace (1984) showed that using Bayesian inference on function words can be effective for author identification. Nativeness classification based on acoustic features has been used to detect foreign accents. Fung and Liu (1999) trained a hidden Markov model (HMM) to discriminate between native and Cantonese-accented English using energy and formant characteristics. Teixeira, Trancoso, and Serralheiro (1996) also used HMMs in a 6-way accent identification task, training a full set of accented acoustic models for each language pair, recognizing using each set of models in parallel, and choosing the model set </context>

Baseline is 56%. itself. It may be the case that non-native utterance detection will also perform well with vocabulary restricted to stopwords, or some other kind of feature selection. So while most of our experiments used no feature selection and included all stopwords, we also experimented with two forms of feature selection: pre-filtering of vocabulary by restricting it to words on one of several standard stopword lists; and feature selection by information gain score (Quinlan, 1986). We compared restricting the vocabulary to that from three stopword lists: the short SMART stopword list (48 words) the long SMART stopword list (524 words), and Mosteller and Wallace&apos;s (1984) first 70 function words. When performing feature selection by information gain, the top-ranking features were selected according to their information gain on the training set, for each train-test split. 5 Classification Results We structured our experiments around the five contrasts discussed in Section 4: • read versus spontaneous speech, • transcriptions versus recognizer hypotheses, • unique articles</context>

Calculation of probabilities was based on a multinomial event model, where feature probability is based on frequencies within documents, rather than just binary occurrence statistics. 3.4 Part-of-speech tagging In some of the experiments we will describe, partof-speech tags are used as input to the classifier instead of words. Part-of-speech tags were produced by the MXPOST toolkit (Ratnaparkhi, 1996). Bigrams and trigrams over the POS-tags were also used, as described above. 4 Experimental Design The task of learning distinctive features of nativeness in text was framed as a document classification problem. That is, each article read by a speaker, or all of a speaker&apos;s side of each conversation, was treated as a unique document. Training data consisted of a set of documents labeled as native and set of documents labeled as non-native (for nonbinary classification tasks documents were labeled with the speaker&apos;s native language).
