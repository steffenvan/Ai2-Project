A recent dramatic increase in activities in computa-
tional linguistics in the German Federal Republic
prompts this note. In particular, considerable attention
has been focused on the major event in this field during
the last few years, the three-week SiC Summer School
(&amp;quot;Sprache im Computerzeitalter&amp;quot; — &amp;quot;Language in the
Computer Age&amp;quot;) organized in Munich in September
1986 by the German Linguistics Society (Deutsche
Gesellschaft fuer Sprachwissenschaft, DGfS), and at-
tended by 260 linguists, including students, faculty
members, and representatives of industrial research and
development departments.
A mark of the importance attributed to the field, and
of the impact of this Summer School, is the inauguration
of a &amp;quot;Sektion Computerlinguistik&amp;quot; in the DGfS during
its Annual Meeting in March 1987, with the aim of
providing an official German partner in computational
linguistics for internationally oriented research, under
the auspices of the official representative body for
linguistics in Germany. This initiative was supported by
37 eminent theoretical and computational linguists on
the staffs of German universities and industrial R&amp;D
departments. The Society considered the time to be ripe
for such a step, which would provide official represen-
tation in a linguistic context for researchers in compu-
tational linguistic questions but working in other fields,
such as applied linguistics (by the &amp;quot;Gesellschaft fuer
Angewandte Linguistik&amp;quot;), phonetic speech signal proc-
essing, or language data processing (in the &amp;quot;Gesells-
chaft fuer linguistische Datenverarbeitung&amp;quot;).
A small amount of background information may help
to put these recent developments into perspective. A
distinction will be made for this purpose between four
related fields, three of which were in focus at the SiC
Summer School:

netics, with recently developed connections to
problems in phonological and prosodic parsing and
generation.
The early predominance of linguistic data processing
(&amp;quot;linguistische Datenverarbeitung&amp;quot;) has been relati-
vized in Germany, as elsewhere, by the increase in
importance of the other three fields during the past
decade, which was inevitably reflected in the SiC
courses.
An interesting feature of the German scene, perhaps
explicable in terms of the Whorfian hypothesis, and at
any rate reflected in the title of the school, is the loan
translation &amp;quot;Computerlinguistik&amp;quot; for &amp;quot;computational
linguistics.&amp;quot; The more abstract, theoretical sense of
&amp;quot;computational&amp;quot; tends to play second fiddle; &amp;quot;comput-
ability,&amp;quot; as a central notion, is &amp;quot;Berechenbarkeit,&amp;quot;
though no-one would (I hope) dream of referring to
&amp;quot;Berechnungslinguistik.&amp;quot; However, the term tends to

cloud the boundaries between the areas mentioned
above even more than usual.
Historically, the current upsurge of interest in com-
putational linguistics is, then, partly associated with the
factor of rising general interest in concrete applications
of computers, particularly microcomputers, with the
idea that experience in language-oriented computer
applications may be a useful kind of qualification for
language and linguistics graduates in an age when
traditional occupations such as state school language
teaching are on the decline.
Another pragmatic factor is the current demand for
research and development in natural language oriented
branches of Al, in particular for German natural lan-
guage access systems for databases and expert systems
and in the context of machine translation, activities
which have been increasing in importance over the past
ten years in German universities, industry and in fund-
ing policy.
A factor which has perhaps contributed less to cur-
rent interest than it has elsewhere is theoretical linguis-
tics, with an interest in computational properties of
natural languages, and in developments and controver-
sies which have motivated the development of compu-
tational tools for the development and testing of linguis-
tic descriptions. During the past decade, linguistics in
Germany has been strongly descriptive, with emphasis
on empirical and interpretative research in fields such as
sociolinguistics, discourse analysis, and language acqui-
sition, with less emphasis on the formal properties of
language structures and processes. The inauguration of
the &amp;quot;Sektion Computerlinguistik&amp;quot; in the DGfS has
re-affirmed the importance of such issues, however.
A more detailed understanding of current interests
may be gleaned from the SiC Summer School pro-
gramme. Five types of events were offered: thematic
courses, intensive practical programming courses in
LISP and PROLOG (elementary and advanced), a lec-
ture cycle by course teachers, invited and guest lec-
tures, and panel discussions. Munich in September also
offered a limitless range of additional activities, of
course.
The courses were held by Hans Altmann and Joa-
chim Jacobs (Munich), Rainer Baeuerle (Tuebingen),
Robin Cooper (Madison &amp; Edinburgh), Konrad Ehlich
(Dortmund) and Jochen Rehbein (Hamburg), Hans-
Juergen Eikmeyer (Bielefeld), Elisabet Engdahl (Mad-
ison &amp; Lund), Guenter Goerz (Erlangen), Helmar Gust
(Osnabrueck), Christopher Habel (Hamburg), Hans
Haugeneder and Manfred Gehrke (Siemens, Munich),
Roland Hauser (Munich), Wolfgang Hoeppner (Ham-
burg, Koblenz), Werner Kasllmeyer (Mannheim), Mar-
tin Kay (Xerox Palo Alto), James Kilbury (Trier),
Juergen Krause (Regensburg), Wolfgang Kreitmair
(Tuebingen), Michael Keoenig (Berlin), Sebastian
Loebner (Dusseldorf), Katharina Monk (Berlin), Peter
Sells (CSLI Stanford), Hans Guenther Tillman &amp; Lies-
lotte Schiefer (Munich), Hans Uszkoreit (IBM Stuttgart
and Stanford), Dietmar Zaefferer (Munich), and Annie
Zaenen (CSLI Stanford).
There was a wide range of topics, from more specif-
ically descriptive and theoretical linguistics topics like
&amp;quot;Syntax and Intonation,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Quantification,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Ana-
phora,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Discourse Analysis&amp;quot; to contemporary
linguistic theories (in particular GPSG, LFG, GB) and
computational linguistic questions of parsing, unifica-
tion, simulation, linguistic formalisms, with linguisti-
cally relevant Al topics such as knowledge representa-
tion or question-answer systems, and finally signal
processing in experimental phonetics.
In addition to lectures by SiC course teachers, in-
vited lectures were given on computational linguistic
and Al NL topics by Lauri Karttunen (Stanford), Henk
Zeevat (Edinburgh), Jun-Ichi Tsujii (Kyoto), Petr Sgall
(Prague), Egbert Lehmann (Siemens Munich), Claus
Rainer Rollinger (IBM Stuttgart), Jaap Hoepelman
(Fraunhofer Gesellschaft Stuttgart), and Thomas
Christaller (Gesellschaft fuer Mathematik und Datenve-
rarbeitung St. Augustin).
The range of courses was rather wide; nevertheless,
there remained sufficient coherence for students to be
able to construct individual programmes, consisting as a
rule of four of the courses (two hours, every other day)
with complementary and interconnected topics. The
present writer&apos;s selection was Kay on &amp;quot;Unification
Grammar,&amp;quot; Kilbury on &amp;quot;Parsing in PROLOG,&amp;quot; Usz-
koreit on GPSG and, further afield, Tillmann and
Schiefer on &amp;quot;Signal Processing in Experimental Phonet-
ics.&amp;quot; Reactions to the courses were varied, of course,
and tended to be polar and &amp;quot;Relevanz&amp;quot; oriented; not a
few participants were dismayed at finding so much
theoretical linguistics and so few recipes for instant NL
systems.
But the impact of the SiC Summer School on German
linguistics has already been considerable and positive,
not least in re-encouraging work among German lin-
guists in fundamental theoretical questions about lan-
guage and computability, and fostering an awareness of
the importance of &amp;quot;useful formalisms.&amp;quot; The effect of
the Summer School will undoubtedly continue to be felt
in the coming years.
