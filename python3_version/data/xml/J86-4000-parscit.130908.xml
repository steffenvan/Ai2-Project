A Note from the Editor
It has certainly been a pleasure on my part, and I&apos;m sure yours, to see the complete Volume 12
appear regularly throughout the year! Furthermore, submissions this year have shown a marked
increase over previous years, so we will publish a minimum of three full papers per issue, starting in
Volume 13. There are several interesting special issues coming up in the near future: Don Walker,
Antonio Zampolli, and Nicoletta Calzolari are currently working on a special issue on the lexicon,;
Wolfgang Wahlster and Alfred Kobsa are preparing one on the topic of user modelling; and Bonnie
Webber is currently soliciting papers for a special issue on tense and aspect (see announcement, this
issue). I personally feel that special issues are exceptionally useful for the field, and encourage
anyone with an idea for such an issue to contact me.
I should mention that a significant part of each issue is not produced from my office, and the
current strength and quality of the FINITE STRING and the Book Review sections are the result of
exceptional dedication on the part of Ralph Weischedel and Graeme Hirst, respectively. The entire
management of the printing and distribution of the journal occurs from Don Walker&apos;s office. This
runs so smoothly that from my perspective it appears that he uses magic! In addition, the editorial
board continues to show its dedication to producing extensive reviews of papers with a minimum of
delay. I wish to take this opportunity to thank everyone for their efforts.
The final key person in this enterprise, I&apos;m sorry to say, will not be working with us for much
longer. Cay Dietrich has done the mammoth job typically done by an entire production staff. She
does all the typesetting, copy editing, and formatting single-handedly, and she alone is responsible
for the high quality appearance of the journal. Unfortunately, issue 13-1 will be her last issue
before she moves to the west coast to begin a new career that will not allow her the time to continue
with us. We are currently despairing at the thought of trying to find a capable replacement.
Much of the reviewing of papers is done by individuals not on the editorial board. In the last
year, we have received assistance from many, including Ed Barton, Lyn Bates, Alan Biermann, Dan
Chester, Martin Chodorow, Phil Cohen, Gary Cottrell, Michal Ephratt, Andy Haas, Don Hindle,
Julia Hirshberg, Graeme Hirst, Ron Kaplan, Terry Langendoen, Diane Litman, John Nerbonne,
Bente Maegard, Geoff Pullum, William Rapaport, Sharon Salveter, Goeff Sampson, Candy Sidner,
Jon Slocum, Susan Stucky, Hans Uszkoreit, Robert Wall, and Ralph Weischedel. I thank them all.
The journal could not run without their valuable contributions.
My only disappointment with the journal has been that lack of feedback in the form of letters to
the editor. I think this is an excellent medium where current controversies could be examined,
providing all of us with a better sense of the field, and what issues people feel most strongly about. I
hope in the future that I will hear more frequently from the readers.
These are exciting times for computational linguistics. The membership of the ACL is growing
dramatically, and the number of high quality submissions to the journal is increasing and shows no
signs of slowing down. I look forward to the next few years and feel there is a tremendous potential
for moving from what still remains an interdisciplinary area to one that has the cohesiveness of a
discipline in its own right.
