Collocation is a common language phenomenon which has attracted the interest of re-
searchers in many subfields of both theoretical and computational linguistics. Although
there is no commonly accepted and precise definition of this phenomenon, collocations
are generally understood as complex lexical items, often characterized as unpredictable,
idiosyncratic, holistic, mutually selective, and so forth. Together with other types of
multiword expressions (or phraseological units, such as compound nouns, phrasal verbs,
idioms, etc.), collocations form a borderline phenomenon positioned between lexis and
grammar: On one hand, they are unpredictable and must be learned in the same way
as single words are (as whole units); on the other hand, they often also have inter-
nal syntactic structure and their components must then adhere to grammatical rules.
Collocations play an important role in applications involving text production (e.g.,
machine translation and language generation), text analysis (e.g., parsing and word
sense disambiguation), and also in other related tasks (such as information extraction,
text classification, etc.).
The book Syntax-Based Collocation Extraction by Violeta Seretan is based on her
doctoral dissertation defended in 2008 at the Department of Linguistics, University of
Geneva, under the supervision of Eric Wehrli, and refers to a number of their previous
publications. The main text is divided into six chapters (amounting to 128 pages) and
six appendices (70 pages).
The first chapter can be regarded as a motivation for the whole work. It introduces
the notion of collocation, explains its relevance (and importance) for natural language
processing, specifies the aims of the work, and most importantly, it presents arguments
for syntax-based collocation extraction as a more appropriate alternative to the tradi-
tional syntax-free n-gram and window-based techniques.
The second chapter focuses on various aspects of collocation, mainly from the
theoretical point of view. It provides a very comprehensive (and readable) survey of
numerous and heterogeneous definitions, descriptions, and discussions of this topic
appearing in the literature in the past 90 years. The author (correctly) points out that
although this phenomenon has an implicit linguistic aspect, the majority of definitions
of collocation rather adopt a statistical view. But other perspectives—lexicographic,
pedagogical, contextualist, and lexical-semantic—are very well addressed, too. Special
attention is paid to the role of collocations in text cohesion, colligation, semantics,
metaphoricity, and a lexis-grammar interface. The author also reviews various semantic
and morpho-syntactic properties of collocations considered in the literature and at-
tempts to define the “core” of the concept of collocation.

The third chapter focuses on practical issues of collocations, namely, methods for
their automatic extraction from text corpora. The author first reviews a general ex-
traction procedure, which consists of two steps: collocation candidate identification
using specific criteria and candidate ranking with a given association measure. Both the
extraction steps are discussed in detail, including linguistic pre-processing, construction
of contingency tables, and application of association measures. A significant part of
the chapter is devoted to the survey of the state of the art in this task. An exhaustive
compendium of relevant works is practically organized by the languages that the ex-
periments were carried out on.
The fourth chapter forms the core of the book. It presents the author’s own
contribution—a method of collocation extraction based on syntactic parsing. The author
again advocates the need for syntax-based extraction methods (supported by several
examples and citations from the literature) and reviews other relevant papers tackling
this issue. The remainder of the chapter is devoted to the description of the proposed
method (which identifies collocation candidates using the Fips parser and ranks them
according to their log-likelihood ratio) and its evaluation in two scenarios. In the
monolingual experiments, the extraction procedure is applied to a part of the Hansard
corpus containing 1.2 million words in French. In the crosslingual case, the extraction
procedure is simultaneously applied to French, English, Spanish, and Italian parts of the
Europarl corpus—each containing about 3.8 million words. The proposed syntax-based
method is compared against a standard window-based extraction technique (with a
sliding window of five consecutive words). The evaluation is performed using manually
judged candidates in terms of precision measured for the 500 top-ranked candidates (in
Experiment 1) and 5 test sets each containing 50 contiguous items situated at different
levels in the ranked list spanning the top 10% for each language (in Experiment 2). In
all cases, the evaluation experiments showed that by applying a syntax-based candi-
date identification “a considerable improvement is obtained over the standard sliding
window method” (p. 97). The results are presented in a very thorough way, including
qualitative analysis and error analysis with lots of concrete examples.
The fifth chapter of the book contains three interesting extensions of the work pre-
sented in the previous chapter. First, the author applies a method based on the simple
concept of “collocation of collocations” for inferring longer collocations from the binary
combinations extracted. The second extension is a technique for data-driven induction
of syntactic patterns which are adequate for identifying collocations. The candidate
patterns (part-of-speech combinations) are ranked using the log-likelihood ratio and
subsequently undergo a process of manual analysis. The third extension addressed is
the automatic acquisition of collocation equivalents from parallel corpora. However, no
thorough evaluation (or comparison with alternative approaches) of these methods is
presented (e.g., a comparison of the translation equivalents extraction method with a
simple look-up of equivalents in a translation phrase table of a phrase-based statistical
machine translation system).
The sixth chapter reviews the main contribution of the research described in the
book and sketches directions for the future work. The appendices contain an overview
of published collocation dictionaries (Appendix A), a list of various definitions of a
collocation (Appendix B), some mathematical notes on association measures, and de-
tailed results of the experiments presented in Chapter 4: the monolingual evaluation
experiment (Appendix D) and the crosslingual evaluation experiment (Appendix E).
The book is generally well written and comprehensively addresses both theoretical
and applied work on collocations and their extraction from text corpora. It does not
require any special previous experience in the field. Most of the technical passages

(e.g., in Chapter 3) are presented in an intuitive and self-contained way, suitable even
for non-expert users. However, certain parts (mostly in the experimental chapters)
lack sufficient detail and/or are somewhat arguable. For example, the author does not
provide (or refer to) any evaluation of the parser’s accuracy and (more importantly) it is
not clear how the accuracy can affect the quality of the collocation extraction procedure.
From the figures in the book, one can guess that the parser provides a complete parse
for about 50% of the sentences but the accuracy on syntactic pairs is unknown. Further,
it seems that the parser features an internal collocation dictionary and collocations
detected by this dictionary automatically receive (by convention) maximum association
score by default. It is not very clear whether those cases are also used in the evaluation
and comparison with the baseline (window-based) method or not. If they are, the
comparison might be unfair; if they are not, we would lose information on how these
cases would be ranked. In any case, the evaluation is probably biased by this dictionary,
although the author does not report on its size and coverage of the corpora and how the
dictionaries differ for the different languages used.
The decision on the window size in the baseline window-based method seems
arbitrary. This hyper-parameter was set to five, but this choice was not supported by any
discussion or evidence (e.g,. distribution of the surface distance of collocation compo-
nents) although it has a substantial effect on performance of the method. The window-
based technique is known to pollute the list of candidates with noise (words without any
syntactic relation), which decreases precision. The author reports that the syntax-based
method outperforms the baseline quite substantially. The difference, however, can be
probably increased by extending the window to six or even more words. On the other
hand, the window can also be shortened and the difference in precision might diminish
or even be reversed. The composition of the evaluation data raises a concern too: The
items which were not agreed upon by the judges were excluded from the evaluation.
There were not that many such cases, but this approach (ignoring borderline cases) is
not very rigorous.
Some other details of the experiments are either missing or not very clear, either.
For example, it is not mentioned which test of statistical significance was used in the
experiments, whether sampling of the evaluation data was really stratified, or what is
meant by “partitioning the candidate data into syntactically homogeneous classes” and
how it affected evaluation.
Overall, Syntax-Based Collocation Extraction is an interesting book and will certainly
be appreciated by researchers interested in collocations and related phenomena. There
is no doubt that collocation extraction should be based on syntactic preprocessing of
the source corpora (simply because collocations often have syntactic structure), but the
evaluation presented in the book is not very convincing. However, the parts surveying
the theoretical aspects of collocations and describing the current state of the art and
related work can easily serve well as a handbook for students entering the field of
collocation extraction.
