Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999787611111111">
In this paper, we want to describe the ar-
chitecture and some of the implementation
issues of a large scale category guesser for
Dutch medical vocabulary. We also provide
numerical data on the precision and cover-
age of this category guesser, which has to
cover for the moment only the vocabulary
of the cardiology domain. The category
guesser uses non-morphologic information
(endstring matching) as well as truly mor-
phologic knowledge (inflection, derivation
and compounding). Since we deal with
a sublanguage some linguistic features are
easier to handle (Grishman and Kittredge,
1986), (Sager et al., 1987). Subsequently
we will describe in detail the differents
parts which interact to successfully identify
unknown medical words.

<bodyText confidence="0.999516961538462">
Medical patient reports consists mainly of free text,
combined with results of various laboratories. While
numerical data can easily be stored and processed for
archiving and research purposes, free text is rather
difficult to be treated by computer, although it con-
tains the most relevant information. Several authors
put forward the hypothesis that Natural Language
Processing (NLP) and Knowledge Representation
(KR) of medical discharge summaries have become
the key-issues in the domain of intelligent medical in-
formation processing (Baud et al., 1992), (Gabrieli
and Speth, 1987), (McCray, 1991). However, only a
few NLP-driven systems have actually been imple-
mented (Friedman and Johnson, 1992) . For Dutch,
a limited prototype has been developed (Spyns,
1991), (Spyns and Adriaens, 1992). A broader sys-
tem covering a larger part of the Dutch grammar and
medical vocabulary is currently under development.
This activity forms part of the MENELAS-project 1
. This project comprises a morphological, syntactic,
semantic and pragmatic analysis of the medical sub-
language for Dutch, English and French (Spyns et
al., 1992). The project also focuses on Knowledge
Representation (by means of Conceptual Graphs)
(Sowa, 1984), (Volot et al., 1993) and Production
Systems (Bouaud and Zweigenbaum, 1992).

1.2 The Category Guesser for Dutch
Medical Language
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99983225">
This paper focuses on the morphological and lex-
ical component of the system, which is a combi-
nation of a database application and a Prolog rule
interpreter. This component is already functioning
and is used continuously during the current exten-
sion of the coverage of the Dutch grammar (Spyns
et al., 1993). The importance of morphologic analy-
sis of medical vocabulary has been widely recognised
(Wingert, 1985), (Wolff, 1984), (Dujols et al., 1991),
(Pacak and Pratt, 1969) (Pacak and Pratt, 1978),
(Norton, 1983).
In the following sections, we will describe the dif-
ferent parts which interact to identify the word forms
of a given sentence. The various stages of the anal-
ysis of the word forms are described. A major dis-
tinction can be made between forms &amp;quot;known by the
system&amp;quot; (= stored in the dictionary cf. section 2) and
unknown forms whose linguistic characteristics need
to be computed and are hypothetical. The latter
can be based on morphologic knowledge (section 3)
or other heuristics (sections 4, 5 &amp; 6). Each section
is illustrated by an example or some implementation
details. A schematic overview of the architecture of
the category guesser is presented in section 7. The
subsequent section (8) is devoted to the evaluation,
which will guide the further elaboration of the here
described category guesser. The paper ends with a
conclusion and discussion (section 9).

2 Pull Form Dictionary
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999824307692308">
The lexical database for Dutch was built using sev-
eral resources: an existing electronic valency dic-
tionary and a list of words extracted from a medi-
cal corpus (cardiology patient discharge summaries).
The already existing electronic dictionary (resulting
from the K.U. Leuven PROTON-project (Dehaspe
and Van Langendonck, ) and the newly coded entries
were converted and merged into a common represen-
tation in a relational database (Dehaspe, 1993).
It is intended to use the category guesser (cf. infra)
as little as possible. To that extent, the dictionary is
conceived as a full-form dictionary. Currently, there
are some 100.000 full forms in the lexical database
(which is some 8000 non inflected forms). How-
ever, since an exhaustive dictionary is an unrealistic
assumption, a category guesser handles all the un-
known word forms.
The unknown words trigger a set of rules to iden-
tify the surface form, to attribute syntactic cate-
gories to it, and to calculate the possible canoni-
cal form(s). The category guesser can also enhance
the robustness of the larger NLP-system since mis-
spelled words can receive, to a certain extent, cor-
rect syntactic features. To reach this aim, the cat-
egory guesser combines morphologic (3) as well as
non morphologic knowledge (sections 4 &amp; 6).

3 Morphological Analysis
</sectionHeader>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998828">
3.1 Preliminary Remarks
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998405416666666">
The morphological analyser consists mainly of three
sections, which correspond more or less to the three
linguistic operations on words: inflection, derivation
and compounding. However, from an implementa-
tional point of view, the boundaries between deriva-
tion and compounding are defined in a different way.
The compounds, created by agglutination or com-
bined by means of a hyphen are computationally
treated as non-compounds. This implies that the
same segmentation routine can be used for the com-
putation of derivations and monolithical compounds
(Spyns and De Wachter, 1995).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.996409">
3.2 Inflection
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9996146">
The inflection analyser produces one or more bun-
dles of morphosyntactic feature value pairs for each
submitted surface form (= cohort). The generated
feature bundles comprise, among other features, the
surface form (lex), the supposed canonical form
(nliu) as well as its category (cat) 2 . A reduced
example of the cohort produced for &amp;quot;geprobeerd&amp;quot;
(Eng.: &amp;quot;tried&amp;quot;) follows (see figure 1).
The initial cohort will later on be reduced as much
as possible (the ideal result in most cases being a sin-
gle feature bundle). Therefore, a cascading priority
system has been defined. The attribute &amp;quot;morf&amp;quot; ex-
presses the quality of the analysis, possible values
being segm, suffix, string or guess with segm &gt; suf-
fix &gt; string &gt; guess. More details on this will be
given below.
Only the feature bundles of supposed nouns,
verbs, adjectives and adverbs (i.e. the open cate-
gories) are admitted in the initial set of hazardous
analyses or cohort.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998413">
3.3 Segmentation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.886946260869565">
Derivation and monolithical compounding are used
to try and identify as many as possible of the canon-
ical forms computed by the inflectional analyser.
The starting principle here is that the right part
of the computed canonical form usually constitutes
the grammatical head of the whole word. The
whole word thus inherits the feature-bundle associ-
ated with its right part (Selkirk, 1982, p.150) 3 .
In opposition to William (Williams, 1983) &amp;
Selkirk (Selkirk, 1982), we do not allow inflectional
suffixes to be heads. The right part can be found in
the dictionary (monolithical compounding) or in a
list of suffixes (derivation). In the current segmen-
tation program, the major part of this list contains
medical suffixes, which constitute a clearly definable
2v for verbs, adj for adjectives and n for noun; others
are nb [sing or plur] for number, pers [1, 2, 3 or nil] for
person.
3We are fully aware that linguistic reality is more
complex: e.g. some derivations (f.i. Dutch diminutifs
cf. (Ritchie et al., 1992)) are regarded as left headed.
Maybe they should be treated computationally by the
inflectional analyser.

The computed canonical form is scanned and seg-
mentated from right to left. All possible solutions
are generated by a failure driven loop (no exclusive
longest match principle). The segmentation rou-
tine which tries to identify a right part (head:dict or
head:suffix) and then tries to recognize the remain-
ing left part. If this succeeds, the segmentation is
complete (morf:segm). Otherwise, it is only partial
(mod: suffix).
At the moment, only noun noun compounds are
treated. Many medical noun noun compounds com-
bine a medical non head part with a non medical
head part (f.i. hartziekte - Eng.: heartdisease).
Only those feature bundles of the cohort are kept
that are compatible (by means of graph-unification)
with the feature bundle associated with the head
part (suffix or dictionary entry). At this stage of
filtering, the feature cat (syntactic category) plays a
most prominent role.

4 Endstring Matching
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99987796">
When nothing can be predicted by means of mor-
phology, another heuristic will be applied to reduce
the set of remaining possible morphological analyses.
This stage will focus more on the general language
words. It is based on a series of endstrings (not lim-
ited by morphological boundaries) which determine
the category of a word. Only the open syntactic
classes are taken into account (noun, verb, adjective
and adverb). Some endstrings uniquely identify the
category of a word while others are more equivocal.
The latter are correlated with two or even three cat-
egories. The necessary linguistic knowledge to build
a list of non-inflected endstrings and their associ-
ated category (or categories) was found in Lemmens
(Lemmens, 1989). Some combinations of an end-
string and its category are shown below (see figure
3).
When a computed lexical form is presented to
the endstring matcher, the above mentioned list is
checked to see if an endstring constitutes the endpart
of the submitted word. In fact, the surface form as
well as the hypothetical canonical form of the fea-
ture bundle are submitted to the endstring matcher.
Only the categories resulting of both matching pro-
cesses (= the intersection) are finally retained. Sub-

sequently, the feature bundle(s) of the cohort con-
taining the proposed syntactic category are extended
with an extra featurevaluepair (morEstring). Below
(see figure 4) the result of endstring matching ap-
plied to the verb &amp;quot;geprobeerd&amp;quot; (Eng.: &amp;quot;tried&amp;quot;) is
shown (rule with ending -eerd applies) 4 .
The inflection rules were able to produce a canon-
ical form together with its category which the end-
string matcher considers correct. This implies that
the inflection rule was correctly triggered and ap-
plied. As a corollary, the other syntactic information
in such a validated feature bundle (with morf:string)
is supposed to be correct as well. However, many
syntactic features are underspecified 5 .

5 Default or Catch All Rule

<bodyText confidence="0.9987806">
If none of the aforementioned cases apply, the com-
puted canonical forms and its corresponding gram-
matical features are pure guesses. The complete co-
hort is retained and each of its feature bundles is
extended with one extra feature morf: guess.

solutions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999902636363636">
After the stages mentioned above, only a subset of
feature bundles of the cohort will contain the fea-
ture morf. All of these feature bundles contain mor-
phosyntactic information that is validated by the
mentioned heuristics (cf. supra) 6 . This subset is
retained and passed to the syntactic parser. When
segmentations of both types (complete versus par-
tial) are produced, the latter (morf:suffix) are dis-
carded in favour of the former (morf:segm). In that
case, endstring matching nor the catch all rule is
applied.

linguistic features — even when underspecified — in the
feature bundle.

identical to the complete cohort. Validation is a too
strong word in this case.

8 Some Results and Statistics
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999897925925926">
To examine the effectiveness of the category guesser,
all the words from the corpus not appearing in the
dictionary were submitted to the analyser. The to-
tal number of unknown words was 2832. Manual
categorisation revealed the presence of 679 adjec-
tives, 2056 nouns, 82 verbs. The 2832 unique un-
known forms lead to the generation of 6342 supposed
analyses, which means that for every unknown form
2.4 possible canonical forms are retained. We con-
sider the case when an unknown surface form re-
ceives more than two different categories as a guess.
Guesses are always interpreted as bad. If the cate-
gory guesser is not able to attribute a correct cate-
gory, the result is regarded as bad. Once a correct
category, even concurrently with an incorrect one,
is assigned to the submitted word, the outcome is
perceived as good. 7 As the main concern lies with
the syntactic characteristics, we did not consider an
erroneously calculated canonical form as a reason to
reject the complete feature bundle. Manual exami-
nation of the results permits us to state that 83.4 %
of the unknown forms are correctly identified. We
consider the result as fairly good and are convinced
that refinements can lead to an even better result.
The linguistic coverage can be still be improved by
adding rules in order to treat comparatives and su-
perlatives.

<bodyText confidence="0.998758909090909">
A choice was to be made between keeping more po-
tential analyses likely to be correct versus restrict-
ing the cohort to one (or a limited set of) analy-
sis which may be incorrect. As a general strategy,
we prefer to restrict as early as possible the search
space on all the levels of the language understanding
system. Otherwise useless hypotheses will be prop-
agated through the whole system causing a combi-
natorial explosion. However, this attitude can lead
to the rejection of valid solutions and, in the worst
case, can be responsible for a complete failure of the
language understanding system.
A possible optimisation resides in the storage of
the medical suffixes and endstrings in their inflected
forms. They could be integrated in the already ex-
isting full form dictionary. In order to accelerate
the decomposition phases, the morphemes or strings
could be stored in reversed order.
These reorganisations of the data structures also
influence the high level algorithm (cf. section 7).
Since all the words, suffixes and endstrings would be
stored in the database as full forms, the inflectional
analyser (cf. section 3.2) would be merely needed for

noun formally equals the first person singular present of
a regular verb).
the computation of a hypothetical canonical form
and its syntactic characteristics when applying the
catch all rule. This leads without any doubt to a
faster execution of the category guesser as a whole.
As a corollary, the overall architecture of the entire
component becomes simpler and more homogeneous.

<abstract confidence="0.998952157894737">In this paper, we want to describe the architecture and some of the implementation issues of a large scale category guesser for Dutch medical vocabulary. We also provide numerical data on the precision and coverage of this category guesser, which has to cover for the moment only the vocabulary of the cardiology domain. The category guesser uses non-morphologic information (endstring matching) as well as truly morphologic knowledge (inflection, derivation and compounding). Since we deal with a sublanguage some linguistic features are easier to handle (Grishman and Kittredge, 1986), (Sager et al., 1987). Subsequently we will describe in detail the differents parts which interact to successfully identify unknown medical words.</abstract>

While numerical data can easily be stored and processed for archiving and research purposes, free text is rather difficult to be treated by computer, although it contains the most relevant information. Several authors put forward the hypothesis that Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Knowledge Representation (KR) of medical discharge summaries have become the key-issues in the domain of intelligent medical information processing (Baud et al., 1992), (Gabrieli and Speth, 1987), (McCray, 1991). However, only a few NLP-driven systems have actually been implemented (Friedman and Johnson, 1992) . For Dutch, a limited prototype has been developed (Spyns, 1991), (Spyns and Adriaens, 1992). A broader system covering a larger part of the Dutch grammar and medical vocabulary is currently under development. This activity forms part of the MENELAS-project 1 .

It is based on a series of endstrings (not limited by morphological boundaries) which determine the category of a word. Only the open syntactic classes are taken into account (noun, verb, adjective and adverb). Some endstrings uniquely identify the category of a word while others are more equivocal. The latter are correlated with two or even three categories. The necessary linguistic knowledge to build a list of non-inflected endstrings and their associated category (or categories) was found in Lemmens (Lemmens, 1989). Some combinations of an endstring and its category are shown below (see figure 3). When a computed lexical form is presented to the endstring matcher, the above mentioned list is checked to see if an endstring constitutes the endpart of the submitted word. In fact, the surface form as well as the hypothetical canonical form of the feature bundle are submitted to the endstring matcher. Only the categories resulting of both matching processes (= the intersection) are finally retained.

Only the feature bundles of supposed nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs (i.e. the open categories) are admitted in the initial set of hazardous analyses or cohort. 3.3 Segmentation Derivation and monolithical compounding are used to try and identify as many as possible of the canonical forms computed by the inflectional analyser. The starting principle here is that the right part of the computed canonical form usually constitutes the grammatical head of the whole word. The whole word thus inherits the feature-bundle associated with its right part (Selkirk, 1982, p.150) 3 .

The project also focuses on Knowledge Representation (by means of Conceptual Graphs) (Sowa, 1984), (Volot et al., 1993) and Production Systems (Bouaud and Zweigenbaum, 1992). 1.2 The Category Guesser for Dutch Medical Language This paper focuses on the morphological and lexical component of the system, which is a combination of a database application and a Prolog rule interpreter. This component is already functioning and is used continuously during the current extension of the coverage of the Dutch grammar (Spyns et al., 1993). The importance of morphologic analysis of medical vocabulary has been widely recognised (Wingert, 1985), (Wolff, 1984), (Dujols et al., 1991), (Pacak and Pratt, 1</context>

The starting principle here is that the right part of the computed canonical form usually constitutes the grammatical head of the whole word. The whole word thus inherits the feature-bundle associated with its right part (Selkirk, 1982, p.150) 3 . In opposition to William (Williams, 1983) &amp; Selkirk (Selkirk, 1982), we do not allow inflectional suffixes to be heads. The right part can be found in the dictionary (monolithical compounding) or in a list of suffixes (derivation). In the current segmentation program, the major part of this list contains medical suffixes, which constitute a clearly definable 2v for verbs, adj for adjectives and n for noun; others are nb [sing or plur] for number, pers [1, 2, 3 or nil] for person. 3We are fully aware that linguistic reality is more complex: e.g. some derivations (f.i. Dutch diminutifs cf. (Ritchie et al., 1992)) are regarded as left h</context>
