It is popular for users in Web 2.0 era to
freely annotate online resources with tags.
To ease the annotation process, it has been
great interest in automatic tag suggestion. We
propose a method to suggest tags according to
the text description of a resource. By consid-
ering both the description and tags of a given
resource as summaries to the resource written
in two languages, we adopt word alignment
models in statistical machine translation to
bridge their vocabulary gap. Based on the
translation probabilities between the words in
descriptions and the tags estimated on a large
set of description-tags pairs, we build a word
trigger method (WTM) to suggest tags accord-
ing to the words in a resource description.
Experiments on real world datasets show that
WTM is effective and robust compared with
other methods. Moreover, WTM is relatively
simple and efficient, which is practical for
Web applications.

In Web 2.0, Web users often use tags to collect and
share online resources such as Web pages, photos,
videos, movies and books. Table 1 shows a book
entry annotated with multiple tags by users1. On
the top of Table 1 we list the title and a short

a resource are annotated collaboratively by multiple
users, we also name these tags as social tags. For
a resource, we refer to the additional information,
such as the title and introduction of a book, as
description, and the user-annotated social tags as

Social tags concisely indicate the main content
of the given resource, and potentially reflect user
interests. Social tagging has thus been widely
studied and successfully applied in recommender
systems (Eck et al., 2007; Yanbe et al., 2007; Zhou
et al., 2010), trend detection and tracking (Hotho
et al., 2006), personalization (Wetzker et al., 2010),
advertising (Mirizzi et al., 2010), etc.
The task of automatic social tag suggestion is
to automatically recommend tags for a user when
he/she wants to annotate a resource. Social tag
suggestion, as a crucial component for social tag-
ging systems, can help users annotate resources.
Moreover, social tag suggestion is usually consid-
ered as an equivalent problem to modeling social

tagging behaviors, which is playing a more and more
important role in social computing and information
retrieval (Wang et al., 2007).
Most online resources contain descriptions, which
usually contain much resource information. For
example, on a book review website, each book entry
contains a title, the author(s) and an introduction
of the book. Some researchers thus propose
to automatically suggest tags based on resource
descriptions, which are collectively known as the
content-based approach.
One may think to suggest tags by selecting
important words from descriptions. This is far from
enough because descriptions and annotations are
using diverse vocabularies, usually referred to as a
vocabulary gap problem. Take the book entry in
Table 1 for instance, the word “popular” used in the
description contrasts the tags “classic” and “famous
book” in the annotation; the word “novel” is used in
the description, while most users annotate with the
tag “fiction”. The vocabulary gap usually reflects in
two main issues:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.985232">
• Some tags in the annotation do appear in the
corresponding description, but they may not be
statistically significant.
• Some tags may even not appear in the descrip-
tion.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99019985">
It is not trivial to reduce the vocabulary gap and
find the semantic correspondence between descrip-
tions and annotations. By regarding both the de-
scription and the annotation as parallel summaries
of a resource, we use word alignment models in
statistical machine translation (SMT) (Brown et
al., 1993) to estimate the translation probabilities
between the words in descriptions and annotations.
SMT has been successfully applied in many ap-
plications to bridge vocabulary gap. For detailed
descriptions of related work, readers can refer to
Section 2.2. In this paper, besides employing word
alignment models to social tagging, we also propose
a method to efficiently build description-annotation
pairs for sufficient learning translation probabilities
by word alignment models.
Based on the learned translation probabilities
between words in descriptions and annotations,
we regard the tagging behavior as a word trigger
process:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.975769">
1. A user reads the resource description to realize
its substance by seeing some important words
in the description.
2. Triggered by these important words, the user
translates them into the corresponding tags, and
annotates the resource with these tags.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.996722571428571">
Based on this perspective, we build a simple word
trigger method (WTM) for social tag suggestion. In
Fig. 1, we use a simple example to show the basic
idea of using word trigger for social tag suggestion.
In this figure, some words in the first sentence of the
book description in Table 1 are triggered to the tags
in annotation.

2.1 Social Tag Suggestion
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999947611111111">
Previous work has been proposed to automatic
social tag suggestion.
Many researchers built tag suggestion systems
based on collaborative filtering (CF) (Herlocker et
al., 1999; Herlocker et al., 2004), a widely used
technique in recommender systems (Resnick and
Varian, 1997). These collaboration-based methods
typically base their suggestions on the tagging
history of the given resource and user, without con-
sidering resource descriptions. FolkRank (Jaschke
et al., 2008) and Matrix Factorization (Rendle et al.,
2009) are representative CF methods for social tag
suggestion. Most of these methods suffer from the
cold-start problem, i.e., they are not able to perform
effective suggestions for resources that no one has
annotated yet.
The content-based approach for social tag sug-
gestion remedies the cold-start problem of the
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.996676857142857">
collaboration-based approach by suggesting tags
according to resource descriptions. Therefore, the
content-based approach plays an important role in
social tag suggestion.
Some researchers regarded social tag suggestion
as a classification problem by considering each tag
as a category label (Ohkura et al., 2006; Mishne,
2006; Lee and Chun, 2007; Katakis et al., 2008;
Fujimura et al., 2008; Heymann et al., 2008).
Various classifiers such as Naive Bayes, kNN, SVM
and neural networks have been explored to solve the
social tag suggestion problem.
There are two issues emerging from the
classification-based methods:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.994635">
• The annotations provided by users are noisy,
and the classification-based methods can not
handle the issue well.
• The training cost and classification cost of
many classification-based methods are usually
in proportion to the number of classification
labels. These methods may thus be inefficient
for a real-world social tagging system, where
hundreds of thousands of unique tags should be
considered as classification labels.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999784055555556">
Inspired by the popularity of latent topic models
such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et
al., 2003), various methods have been proposed to
model tags using generative latent topic models.
One intuitive approach is assuming that both tags
and words are generated from the same set of latent
topics. By representing both tags and descriptions
as the distributions of latent topics, this approach
suggests tags according to their likelihood given
the description (Krestel et al., 2009; Si and Sun,
2009). Bundschus et al. (2009) proposed a joint
latent topic model of users, words and tags. Iwata
et al. (2009) proposed an LDA-based topic model,
Content Relevance Model (CRM), which aimed at
finding the content-related tags for suggestion. Em-
pirical experiments showed that CRM outperformed
both classification methods and Corr-LDA (Blei and
Jordan, 2003), a generative topic model for contents
and annotations.
Most latent topic models have to pre-specify the
number of topics before training. We can either use
cross validation to determine the optimal number
of topics or employ the infinite topic models, such
as Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP) (Teh et al.,
2006) and nested Chinese Restaurant Process (Blei
et al., 2010), to automatically adjust the number
of topics during training. Both solutions are
usually computationally complicated. What is more
important, topic-based methods suggest tags by
measuring the topical relevance of tags and resource
descriptions. The latent topics are of concept-level
which are usually too general to precisely suggest
those specific tags such as named entities, e.g.,
the tags “Dumas” and “Count of Monte Cristo” in
Table 1. To remedy the problem, Si et al. (2010)
proposed a generative model, Tag Allocation Model
(TAM), which considers the words in descriptions
as the possible topics to generate tags. However,
TAM assumes each tag can only have at most one
word as its reason. This is against the fact that a tag
may be annotated triggered by multiple words in the
description.
It should also be noted that social tag suggestion is
different from automatic keyphrase extraction (Tur-
ney, 2000; Frank et al., 1999; Liu et al., 2009a; Liu
et al., 2010b; Liu et al., 2011). Keyphrase extraction
aims at selecting terms from the given document
to represent the main topics of the document. On
the contrary, in social tag suggestion, the suggested
tags do not necessarily appear in the given resource
description. We can thus regard social tag sugges-
tion as a task of selecting appropriate tags from
a controlled tag vocabulary for the given resource
description.

3.1 Method Framework
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997585">
We describe the word trigger method (WTM) for
social tag suggestion as a 3-stage process:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.941805818181818">
1. Preparing description-annotation pairs.
Given a collection of annotated resources, we first
prepare description-annotation pairs for learning
translation probabilities using word alignment mod-
els.
2. Learning a translation model. Given a
collection of description-annotation pairs, we adopt
IBM Model-1, a widely used word alignment model,
to learn the translation probabilities between words
in descriptions and tags in annotations.
3. Suggesting tags given a resource description.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.978166222222222">
After building translation probabilities between
words and tags, given a resource description, we
first compute the trigger power of each word in the
description and then suggest tags according to their
translation probabilities from the triggered words.
Before introducing the method in details, we
introduce the notations. In a social tagging system,
a resource is denoted as r E R, where R is the set of
all resources. Each resource contains a description
and an annotation containing a set of tags. The
description dr of resource r can be regarded as a bag
of words wr = {(wz, ez)}Nr
z=1, where ez is the count
of word wz and Nr is the number of unique words
in r. The annotation ar of resource r is represented
as tr = {(tz, ez)}Mr
z=1, where ez is the count of tag tz
and Mr is the number of unique tags for r.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999907">
3.2 Preparing Description-Annotation Pairs
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999923380952381">
Learning translation probabilities requires a parallel
training dataset consisting of a number of aligned
sentence pairs. We assume the description and the
annotation of a resource as being written in two
distinct languages. We thus prepare our parallel
training dataset by pairing descriptions with anno-
tations.
The annotation of a resource is a bag of tags with
no position information. We thus select IBM Model-
1 (Brown et al., 1993) for training, which does not
take word position information into account on both
sides for each aligned pair.
In a social tagging system, the length of a
resource description is usually limited to hundreds
of words. Meanwhile, it is common that some
popular resources are annotated by multiple users
with thousands of tags. For example, the tag
Dumas is annotated by 2,748 users for the book
in Table 1. We have to deal with the length-
unbalance between a resource description and its
corresponding annotation for two reasons.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.859557">
• It is impossible to list all annotated tags on
the annotation side of a description-annotation
pair. The performance of word alignment
models will also suffer from the unbalanced
length of sentence pairs in the parallel training
data set (Och and Ney, 2003).
• Moreover, the annotated tags may have differ-
ent importance for the resource. It would be
unfair to treat these tags without distinction.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999701636363637">
Here we propose a sampling method to pre-
pare length-balanced description-annotation pairs
for word alignment. The basic idea is to sample
a bag of tags from the annotation according to tag
weights and make the generated bag of tags with
comparable length with the description.
We consider two parameters when sampling tags.
First, we have to select a tag weighting type for
sampling. In this paper, we investigate two straight-
forward sampling types, including tag frequen-
cy (TFt) within the annotation and tag-frequency
inverse-resource-frequency (TF-IRFt). Given re-
source r, TFt and TF-IRFt of tag t are defined
as TFt = et/ Et et and TF-IRFt = et/ Et et X
log (|R|/ |Er∈R Iet&gt;0|�, where  |Er∈R Iet&gt;0 |in-
dicates the number of resources that have been
annotated with tag t.
Another parameter is the length ratio between the
description and the sampled annotation. We denote
the ratio as S = |wr|/|tr|, where |wr |is the number
of words in the description and |tr |is the number of
tags in the annotation.

3.3 Learning Translation Probabilities Using
Word Alignment Models
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998538">
Suppose the source language is resource description
and the target language is resource annotation.
In IBM Model-1, the relationship of the source
language w = wJ1 and the target language t = tI1
is connected via a hidden variable describing an
alignment mapping from source position j to target
position aj:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.997906333333333">
EPr(wJ1 |tI1) = Pr(wJ1 , aJ1 |tI1). (1)
aJ
1
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999887">
The alignment aJ1 also contains empty-word align-
ments aj = 0 which align source words to the
an empty word. IBM Model-1 can be trained
using Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm in
an unsupervised fashion, and obtains the translation
probabilities of two vocabularies, i.e., Pr(w|t),
where t is a tag and w is a word.
IBM Model-1 only produces one-to-many align-
ments from source language to target language.
The learned model is thus asymmetric. We will
learn translation models on two directions: one is
regarding descriptions as the source language and
annotations as the target language, and the other is
in reverse direction of the pairs. We denote the first
model as Prd2a and the latter as Pra2d. We further
define Pr(t|w) as the harmonic mean of the two
models:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.942004">
�Pr(t|w) ∝ λ/Prd2a(t|w)+(1−λ)/Pra2d(t|w) )−1
</equation>

where λ is the harmonic factor to combine the two
models. When λ = 1 or λ = 0, it simply uses model
Prd2a or Pra2d correspondingly.

3.4 Tag Suggestion Using Triggered Words and
Translation Probabilities
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996187">
When given the description of a resource, we can
rank tags by computing the scores:
Here we explore three methods to compute the
trigger power of a word in a resource description:
TF-IRFw, TextRank and their product. TF-IRFw and
TextRank are two most widely adopted methods for
keyword extraction.
Similar to TF-IRFt mentioned in Section 3.2, TF-
IRFw considers both the local importance (TFw) and
global specification (IRFw).
TextRank (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004) is a graph-
based method to compute term importance. Given
a resource description, TextRank first builds a term
graph by connecting the terms in the description
according to their semantic relations, and then run
PageRank algorithm (Page et al., 1998) to measure
the importance of each term in the graph. Readers
can refer to (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004) for detailed
information.
We also use the product of TF-IRFw and Tex-
tRank to weight terms, which potentially takes both
global information and term relations into account.
Emphasize Tags Appearing In Description for
WTM (EWTM) In some social tagging systems,
the tags that appear in the resource description are
more likely to be selected by users for annotation.
Therefore, we propose to emphasize the tags in the
description by ranking tags as follows
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.992744">
Pr(t|d) = E (γIt(w)+(1−γ) Pr(t|w)) Pr(w|d),
w∈wd
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9702484">
(4)
, where It(w) is an indicator function which gets
value 1 when t = w and 0 when t =6 w; and γ is
the smooth factor with range γ ∈ [0.0, 1.0]. When
γ = 1.0, it suggests tags simply according to their
trigger powers within the description, while when
γ = 0.0, it does not emphasize the tags appearing in
the description and just suggests according to their
translation probabilities. In Section 4.4, we will
show the performance of EWTM.

preparing parallel training dataset with O(R ¯Nt) and learning
translation probabilities using word alignment models with
O(IR ¯Nw ¯Nt), where I is the number of iterations for learning
translation probabilities, and ¯Nt is the average number of tags

is O(IN,,,T) and WTM is O(N,,,T). From the
analysis, we can see that WTM is a relatively simple
method for both training and suggestion. This is
especially valuable because WTM also shows good
effectiveness for tag suggestion compared with other
methods as we will shown later.
Parameter Settings We use GIZA++ (Och and
Ney, 2003)5 as IBM Model-1 to learn transla-
tion probabilities using description-annotation pairs
for WTM. The experimental results of WTM are
obtained by setting parameters as follows: tag
weighting type as TF-IRFt, length ratio S = 1,
harmonic factor A = 0.5 and the type of word trigger
strength as TF-IRF,,,. The influence of parameters to
WTM can be found in Section 4.3.
Experiment Results and Analysis In Fig. 2 we
show the precision-recall curves of NB, kNN, CRM
and WTM on two datasets. Each point of a
precision-recall curve represents different numbers
of suggested tags from M = 1 (bottom right, with
higher precision and lower recall) to M = 10
(upper left, with higher recall but lower precision)
respectively. The closer the curve to the upper right,
the better the overall performance of the method.
From Fig. 2, we observe that:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.927861">
• WTM consistently performs the best on both
datasets. This indicates that WTM is robust and
effective for tag suggestion.
• The advantage of WTM is more significant on

the BOOK dataset. The reason is that WTM
can take a good advantage of annotation count
information of tags compared to other methods.
• The average length of resource descriptions is
short in the BIBTEX dataset, which makes
it difficult to determine the trigger powers of
words. But even on the BIBTEX dataset
with no count information of tags, WTM still
outperforms other methods especially when
recommending first several tags.
To further demonstrate the performance of WTM
and other baseline methods, in Table 3 we show the

From Table 4, we observe that NB, CRM and

On the contrary, WTM succeeds in suggesting both

we eliminated the tags with the probability less than
0.1. We can see that the translation probabilities can
map the words in descriptions to their semantically
corresponding tags in annotations.

4.3 Parameter Influences
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.950761971428572">
We explore the parameter influences to WTM for
social tag suggestion. The parameters include
harmonic factor, length ratio, tag weighting types,
and types of word trigger strength. When inves-
tigating one parameter, we set other parameters
to be the values inducing the best performance
as mentioned in Section 4.2. Finally, we also
investigate the influence of training data size for
suggestion performance. In experiments we find
that WTM reveals similar trends on both the BOOK
dataset and the BIBTEX dataset. We thus only show
the experimental results on the BOOK dataset for
analysis.
Harmonic Factor In Fig. 3 we investigate the
influence of harmonic factor via the curves of F-
measure of WTM versus the number of suggested
tags on the BOOK dataset when harmonic factor A
ranges from 0.0 to 1.0. As shown in Section 3.3,
harmonic factor A controls the proportion between
model Prd2a and Pra2d.
From Fig. 3, we observe that neither single model
Prd2a (A = 1.0) nor Pra2d (A = 0.0) achieves
the best performance. When the two models are
combined by harmonic mean, the performance is
consistently better, especially when A ranges from
0.2 to 0.6. This is reasonable because IBM Model-
1 constrains that only the term in source language
can be aligned to multiple terms in target language,
which makes the translation probability learned by a
single model be asymmetric.
Length Ratio Fig. 4 shows the influence of length
ratios on the BOOK dataset. From the figure, we
observe that the performance for tag suggestion is
robust as the length ratio varies, except when the
ratio breaks the default restriction of GIZA++ (i.e.,

Tag Weighting Types The influence of two
weighting types, TFt and TF-IRFt, on social tag
suggestion when M = 3 on the BOOK dataset
is shown in Table 6. TF-IRFt tends to select the
tags more specific to the resource while TFt tends
to select the most popular tags, because the latter
does not consider global information (the IRFt part).
7GIZA++ restricts the values of length ratio within [ 19 , 9] by
setting parameter maxfertility=10. From Fig. 4, we can
see when δ = 10, the performance becomes much worse since
GIZA++ will cut off the sentences out of range.
Table 6 verifies the analysis, where TF-IRFt is
slightly better than TFt.

the worst. This indicates that TextRank is less

At the end of this section, we investigate the
performance of EWTM for social tag suggestion.
Here we simply set the smooth factory = 0.5.
As shown in Table 8, EWTM improves the
performance of WTM (in Table 7) on the BOOK
dataset when using TF-IRF,,, and the product as the
methods for computing the word trigger powers,
but decays when using TextRank. This verifies
that TF-IRF,,, is the best method to measure word
trigger powers for WTM. Table 8 indicates that
emphasizing the tags appearing in the descriptions
may enhance the suggestion power of the word
trigger method.

ferent methods for computing word trigger powers
when M = 3 on the BOOK dataset.
However, the performance of EWTM on the
BIBTEX dataset decays much compared to WTM.
The F-measure of EWTM is only F = 0.229
compared with WTM F = 0.267. The main reason
of the decay is that: the resource descriptions in
the BIBTEX dataset are usually too short to provide
sufficient information to precisely emphasize tags.
In this case, EWTM may emphasize wrong tags and
drop correct tags.
The experimental results on EWTM suggest that,
the performance of EWTM is heavily influenced by
the length of resource descriptions. Therefore, we
have to analyze the characteristics of social tagging
systems to decide whether to emphasize the tags that
appear in the corresponding resource descriptions.
As future work, we will investigate the influence
of the smooth factor y to EWTM. It is also worth
to investigate the problem when combining with
collaboration-based methods for social tag sugges-
tion.

5 Conclusion and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.807726666666667">
In this paper, we present a new perspective to social
tagging and propose the word trigger method for
social tag suggestion based on word alignment in
statistical machine translation. Experiments show
that our method is effective and efficient for social
tag suggestion compared to other baselines.
There are still several open problems that should
be further investigated:
1. We can exploit other word alignment methods
like log-linear models (Liu et al., 2010a) for
social tag suggestion.
2. We will ensemble WTM with other content-
based and collaboration-based methods to build
a practical social tag suggestion system.
3. WTM and EWTM can only suggest the tags
that have appeared in translation models. In
future, we plan to incorporate keyphrase ex-
traction in social tag suggestion to make it
suggest more appropriate tags not only from
translation models but also from the resource
descriptions.

<abstract confidence="0.987072181818182">It is popular for users in Web 2.0 era to freely annotate online resources with tags. To ease the annotation process, it has been great interest in automatic tag suggestion. We propose a method to suggest tags according to the text description of a resource. By considering both the description and tags of a given resource as summaries to the resource written in two languages, we adopt word alignment models in statistical machine translation to their Based on the translation probabilities between the words in descriptions and the tags estimated on a large set of description-tags pairs, we build a word trigger method (WTM) to suggest tags according to the words in a resource description. Experiments on real world datasets show that WTM is effective and robust compared with other methods. Moreover, WTM is relatively simple and efficient, which is practical for Web applications.</abstract>

There are two issues emerging from the classification-based methods: • The annotations provided by users are noisy, and the classification-based methods can not handle the issue well. • The training cost and classification cost of many classification-based methods are usually in proportion to the number of classification labels. These methods may thus be inefficient for a real-world social tagging system, where hundreds of thousands of unique tags should be considered as classification labels. Inspired by the popularity of latent topic models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003), various methods have been proposed to model tags using generative latent topic models. One intuitive approach is assuming that both tags and words are generated from the same set of latent topics.

The vocabulary gap usually reflects in two main issues: • Some tags in the annotation do appear in the corresponding description, but they may not be statistically significant. • Some tags may even not appear in the description. It is not trivial to reduce the vocabulary gap and find the semantic correspondence between descriptions and annotations. By regarding both the description and the annotation as parallel summaries of a resource, we use word alignment models in statistical machine translation (SMT) (Brown et al., 1993) to estimate the translation probabilities between the words in descriptions and annotations. SMT has been successfully applied in many applications to bridge vocabulary gap. For detailed descriptions of related work, readers can refer to Section 2.2. In this paper, besides employing word alignment models to social tagging, we also propose a method to efficiently build description-annotation pairs for sufficient learning translation probabilities by word alignment models. Based on the learned translation probabilities between words in descriptions and annotations, we regard the tagging behavio</context>

We assume the description and the annotation of a resource as being written in two distinct languages. We thus prepare our parallel training dataset by pairing descriptions with annotations. The annotation of a resource is a bag of tags with no position information. We thus select IBM Model1 (Brown et al., 1993) for training, which does not take word position information into account on both sides for each aligned pair. In a social tagging system, the length of a resource description is usually limited to hundreds of words. Meanwhile, it is common that some popular resources are annotated by multiple users with thousands of tags. For example, the tag Dumas is annotated by 2,748 users for the book in Table 1. We have to deal with the lengthunbalance between a resource description and its corresponding annotation for two reasons. • It is impossible to list all annotated tags on the annotation side of a</context>

To remedy the problem, Si et al. (2010) proposed a generative model, Tag Allocation Model (TAM), which considers the words in descriptions as the possible topics to generate tags. However, TAM assumes each tag can only have at most one word as its reason. This is against the fact that a tag may be annotated triggered by multiple words in the description. It should also be noted that social tag suggestion is different from automatic keyphrase extraction (Turney, 2000; Frank et al., 1999; Liu et al., 2009a; Liu et al., 2010b; Liu et al., 2011). Keyphrase extraction aims at selecting terms from the given document to represent the main topics of the document. On the contrary, in social tag suggestion, the suggested tags do not necessarily appear in the given resource description. We can thus regard social tag suggestion as a task of selecting appropriate tags from a controlled tag vocabulary for the given resource description. 2.2 Applications of SMT SMT techniques have been successfully used in many tasks of information retrieval and natural language processing to bridge the v</context>

Table 1: An example of social tagging. The number in the bracket after each tag is the total count of users that annotate the tag on this book. Social tags concisely indicate the main content of the given resource, and potentially reflect user interests. Social tagging has thus been widely studied and successfully applied in recommender systems (Eck et al., 2007; Yanbe et al., 2007; Zhou et al., 2010), trend detection and tracking (Hotho et al., 2006), personalization (Wetzker et al., 2010), advertising (Mirizzi et al., 2010), etc. The task of automatic social tag suggestion is to automatically recommend tags for a user when he/she wants to annotate a resource. Social tag suggestion, as a crucial component for social tagging systems, can help users annotate resources.

One intuitive approach is assuming that both tags and words are generated from the same set of latent topics. By representing both tags and descriptions as the distributions of latent topics, this approach suggests tags according to their likelihood given the description (Krestel et al., 2009; Si and Sun, 2009). Bundschus et al. (2009) proposed a joint latent topic model of users, words and tags. Iwata et al. (2009) proposed an LDA-based topic model, Content Relevance Model (CRM), which aimed at finding the content-related tags for suggestion. Empirical experiments showed that CRM outperformed both classification methods and Corr-LDA (Blei and Jordan, 2003), a generative topic model for contents and annotations. Most latent topic models have to pre-specify the number of topics before training. We can either use cross validation to determine the optimal number of topics or employ the infinite topic models, such as Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP) (Teh et al., 2006) and nested Chinese Restaurant Proces</context>

TF-IRFw and TextRank are two most widely adopted methods for keyword extraction. Similar to TF-IRFt mentioned in Section 3.2, TFIRFw considers both the local importance (TFw) and global specification (IRFw). TextRank (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004) is a graphbased method to compute term importance. Given a resource description, TextRank first builds a term graph by connecting the terms in the description according to their semantic relations, and then run PageRank algorithm (Page et al., 1998) to measure the importance of each term in the graph. Readers can refer to (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004) for detailed information. We also use the product of TF-IRFw and TextRank to weight terms, which potentially takes both global information and term relations into account.

Most of these methods suffer from the cold-start problem, i.e., they are not able to perform effective suggestions for resources that no one has annotated yet. The content-based approach for social tag suggestion remedies the cold-start problem of the 1578 collaboration-based approach by suggesting tags according to resource descriptions. Therefore, the content-based approach plays an important role in social tag suggestion. Some researchers regarded social tag suggestion as a classification problem by considering each tag as a category label (Ohkura et al., 2006; Mishne, 2006; Lee and Chun, 2007; Katakis et al., 2008; Fujimura et al., 2008; Heymann et al., 2008). Various classifiers such as Naive Bayes, kNN, SVM and neural networks have been explored to solve the social tag suggestion problem. There are two issues emerging from the classification-based methods: • The annotations provided by users are noisy, and the classification-based methods can not handle the issue well. • The training cost and classification cost of many classification-based methods are usually in proportion to the number of classification labels.

Meanwhile, it is common that some popular resources are annotated by multiple users with thousands of tags. For example, the tag Dumas is annotated by 2,748 users for the book in Table 1. We have to deal with the lengthunbalance between a resource description and its corresponding annotation for two reasons. • It is impossible to list all annotated tags on the annotation side of a description-annotation pair. The performance of word alignment models will also suffer from the unbalanced length of sentence pairs in the parallel training data set (Och and Ney, 2003). • Moreover, the annotated tags may have different importance for the resource. It would be unfair to treat these tags without distinction. Here we propose a sampling method to prepare length-balanced description-annotation pairs for word alignment. The basic idea is to sample a bag of tags from the annotation according to tag weights and make the generated bag of tags with comparable length with the description. We consider two parameters when sampling tags. First, we have to select a tag weighting type for sampling. In this paper, we investigate two straightforward sampling types, including</context>

From the analysis, we can see that WTM is a relatively simple method for both training and suggestion. This is especially valuable because WTM also shows good effectiveness for tag suggestion compared with other methods as we will shown later. Parameter Settings We use GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003)5 as IBM Model-1 to learn translation probabilities using description-annotation pairs for WTM. The experimental results of WTM are obtained by setting parameters as follows: tag weighting type as TF-IRFt, length ratio S = 1, harmonic factor A = 0.5 and the type of word trigger strength as TF-IRF,,,. The influence of parameters to WTM can be found in Section 4.3. Experiment Results and Analysis In Fig. 2 we show the precision-recall curves of NB, kNN, CRM and WTM on two datasets.

Inspired by the popularity of latent topic models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003), various methods have been proposed to model tags using generative latent topic models. One intuitive approach is assuming that both tags and words are generated from the same set of latent topics. By representing both tags and descriptions as the distributions of latent topics, this approach suggests tags according to their likelihood given the description (Krestel et al., 2009; Si and Sun, 2009). Bundschus et al. (2009) proposed a joint latent topic model of users, words and tags. Iwata et al. (2009) proposed an LDA-based topic model, Content Relevance Model (CRM), which aimed at finding the content-related tags for suggestion. Empirical experiments showed that CRM outperformed both classification methods and Corr-LDA (Blei and Jordan, 2003), a generative topic model for contents and annotations. Most latent topic models have to pre-specify the number of topics before training.

Moreover, social tag suggestion is usually considered as an equivalent problem to modeling social 1577 Proceedings of the 2011 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1577–1588, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK, July 27–31, 2011. c�2011 Association for Computational Linguistics tagging behaviors, which is playing a more and more important role in social computing and information retrieval (Wang et al., 2007). Most online resources contain descriptions, which usually contain much resource information. For example, on a book review website, each book entry contains a title, the author(s) and an introduction of the book. Some researchers thus propose to automatically suggest tags based on resource descriptions, which are collectively known as the content-based approach. One may think to suggest tags by selecting important words from descriptions. This is far from enough because descriptions and annotations are using diverse vocabularies, usually referred to as a vocabulary gap problem. Take the book</context>
