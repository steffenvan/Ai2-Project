This paper is concerned with the question of
how to extract lexical knowledge from Machine-
Readable Dictionaries (MRDs) within a lexi-
cal database which integrates a lexicon devel-
opment environment. Our long term objective
is the creation of a large lexical knowledge base
using semiautomatic techniques to recover syn-
tactic and semantic information from MRDs.
In doing so, one finds that reliance on a single
MRD source induces inadequacies which could
be efficiently redressed through access to com-
bined MRD sources. In the general case, the
integration of information from distinct MRDs
remains a problem hard, perhaps impossible, to
solve without the aid of a complete, linguisti-
cally motivated database which provides a ref-
erence point for comparison. Nevertheless, ad-
vances can be made by attempting to correlate
dictionaries which are not too dissimilar. In
keeping with these observations, we describe a
software package for correlating MRDs based
on sense merging techniques and show how such
a tool can be employed in augmenting a lexical
knowledge base built from a conventional MRD
with thesaurus information.

Over the last few years, the utilization of machine read-
able dictionaries (MRDs) in compiling lexical compo-
nents for Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems
has awakened the interest of an increasing number of re-
searchers. This trend has largely arisen from the recog-
nition that access to a large scale Lexical Knowledge
Base (LKB) is a sine qua non for real world applica-
tions of NLP systems. Computer-aided acquisition of
lexical knowledge from MRDs can be made to satisfy this
prerequisite in a manner which is both time- and cost-
effective. However, to maximize the utility of MRDs in
*The research reported in this paper was carried out at
the Computer Laboratory (University of Cambridge) as part
of an ongoing study on the acquisition of lexical knowledge
from machine-readable dictionaries within the ACQUILEX
project, ESPRIT BRA 3030.
NLP applications, it is necessary to overcome inconsis-
tencies, omissions and the occasional errors which are
commonly found in MRDs (Atkins et al., 1986; Atkins,
1989; Akkerman, 1989; Boguraev &amp; Briscoe, 1989). This
goal can be partly achieved by developing tools which
make it possible to correct errors and inconsistencies
contained in the information structures automatically
derived from the source MRD before these are stored
in the LKB or target lexicon (Carroll &amp; Grover, 1989).
This technique is nevertheless of little avail in redress-
ing inadequacies which arise from lack of information.
In this case, manual supply of the missing information
would be too time- and labour-intensive to be desirable.
Moreover, the information which is missing can be usu-
ally obtained from other MRD sources. Consider, for ex-
ample, a situation in which we wanted to augment lexical
representations available from a conventional dictionary
with thesaurus information. There can be little doubt
that the integration of information from distinct MRD
sources would be far more convenient and appropriate
than reliance on manual encoding.
In the general case, the integration of information from
distinct MRD sources for use within a lexicon develop-
ment environment is probably going to remain an un-
solved problem for quite some time. This is simply be-
cause dictionaries seldom describe the same word using
the same sense distinctions. Consequently, the integra-
tion of information from distinct MRD sources through
simple word-sense matches is likely to fail in a significant
number of instances (Calzolari &amp; Picchi, 1986; Atkins
1987; Klavans 1988; Boguraev &amp; Pustejovsky 1990). In-
deed, Atkins &amp; Levin (1990) have suggested that the
task of mapping MRDs onto each other is so complex
that the creation of a complete &apos;ideal&apos; database which
provides a reference point for the MRD sources to be in-
tegrated may well be considered as an essential prereq-
uisite. However, when dealing with MRD sources which
use entry definitions which are not too dissimilar, a cor-
relation technique based on word sense merging can be
made to yield useful results, given the appropriate tools
Although sense matching across dictionaries in this case
too is prone to errors, there are several reasons why the
effort is worthwhile. First, the number of correct sense
matches across MRD sources in this case is guaranteed
to be high. Second, there are many instances in which ar
incorrect sense-to-sense match does not affect the fina
result since the information with respect to which a sense
correlation is being sought may generalize across closely
related word senses. Third, a close inspection of infelici-
tous matches provides a better understanding of specific
difficulties involved in the task and may help develop
solutions. Finally, the construction of a linguistically
motivated database aimed to facilitate the interrogation
of combined MRD sources would be highly enhanced by
the availability of new tools for lexicology. Partial as
it may be, the possibility of mapping MRDs onto each
other through sense-merging techniques should thus be
seen as a step forward in the right direction.
The goal of this paper is to describe a software pack-
age for correlating word senses across dictionaries which
can be straightforwardly tailored to an individual user&apos;s
needs, and has convenient facilities for interactive sense
matching. We also show how such a tool can be em-
ployed in augmenting a lexical knowledge base built from
a conventional MRD with thesaurus information.

2 Background
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998306125">
Our point of departure is the Lexical Data Base (LDB)
and LKB tools developed at the Computer Laboratory
in Cambridge within the context of the ACQUILEX
project. The LDB (Carroll, 1990) gives flexible access
to MRDs and is endowed with a graphic interface which
provides a user-friendly environment for query formation
and information retrieval. It allows several dictionaries
to be loaded and queried in parallel.
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.9604855">

</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.999916538461538">
Until recently, this facility has been used to extract in-
formation from combined MRD sources which included
a main dictionary and a number of dictionaries derived
from it. For example, the information needed to build
LKB representations for English verbs (see below) was
partly obtained by running LDB queries which combined
information from the Longman Dictionary of Contempo-
rary English (LDOCE) and two other dictionaries de-
rived from LDOCE: LDOCE_Inter and LDOCE_Sem.
LDOCE_Inter was derived by a translation program
which mapped the grammar codes of LDOCE entries
into theoretically neutral intermediate representations
(Boguraev &amp; Briscoe, 1989; Carroll St Grover, 1989).
LDOCE_Sem was derived by extracting genus terms
from dictionary definitions in LDOCE (Alshawi, 1989;
Vossen, 1990). Figure 1 provides an illustrative example
of an LDB query which combines these MRD sources.
We used these LDB facilities for running queries from
combined MRD sources which included more than one
MRD — i.e. LDOCE and the Longman Lexicon of Con-
temporary English (LLOCE), a thesaurus closely related
to LDOCE.
The LKB provides a lexicon development environment
which uses a typed graph-based unification formalism
as representation language. A detailed description of
the LKB&apos;s representation language is given in papers
by Copestake, de Paiva and Sanfilippo in Briscoe et al.
(forthcoming); various properties of the system are also
discussed in Briscoe (1991) and Copestake (1992). The
LKB allows the user to define an inheritance network
of types plus restrictions associated with them, and to
create lexicons where such types are assigned to lexi-
cal templates extracted through LDB queries which give
word-sense specific information. Consider, for exam-
ple, the lexical template relative to the first LDOCE
sense of the verb delight in (1) where sense specific infor-
mation is integrated with a reference to the LKB type
STRICT-TRANS-SIGN which provides a general syntactic
and semantic characterization of strict transitive verbs.1

When loaded into the LKB, the lexical template above

tion arises from integrating sense-specific information
with the information structure associated with the type

the LDB value Unaccusative (see Figure 1) and marks tran-
sitive verbs which are amenable to the indefinite object alter-
nation, e.g. a book which is certain to delight them vs. a book
which is certain to delight. Information concerning diathesis
alternations is also derived from LDOCEinter. The value
TRUE for the attribute reg-atorph indicates that delight has
regular morphology. OBJ and E-HUMAN are sorted variables
for individual objects.
2According to the verb representation adopted in the LKB
(Sanfilippo, forthcoming), verbs are treated as predicates of
eventualities and thematic roles as relations between eventu-
alities and individuals (Parsons, 1990). The semantic content

Lexical templates such as the one in (1) are generated
through a user definable conversion function — a facil-
ity included in the LKB — which makes it possible to
establish correspondences between information derived
through LDB queries and LKB types. For example,
information relative to selectional restrictions for tran-
sitive verbs (e.g. e-human and obj in (1)) is encoded
by establishing a correspondence between the value for
the individual variables of the subject and object roles
in LKB representations and the values retrieved from
the relevant LDOCE entry for box codes 5 and 10 (see
Figure 1). Similarly, the assignment of verb types (e.g.
STRICT-TRANS-SIGN) to verb senses is carried out by re-
lating LKB types for English verbs — about 30 in the
current implementation (Sanfilippo, forthcoming) — to
subcategorization patterns retrieved from LDOCE_Inter.
For example, if a verb sense in LDOCE_Inter were asso-
ciated with the information in (2), the conversion func-
tion would associate the lexical template being generated
with the type STRICT-TRANS-SIGN.

Needless to say, the amount of information specified in
LKB entries will be directly proportional to the amount
of information which can be reliably extracted through
LDB queries. With respect to verbs, there are several
of roles is computed in terms of entailments of verb meanings
which determine the most (p-agt) and least (p-pat) agentive
event participants for each choice of predicate; see Figures 4
and 5 for illustrative example. This approach reproduces the
insights of Dowty&apos;s and Jackendoff&apos;s treatments of thematic
information (Dowty, 1991; Jackendoff, 1990) within a neo-
Davidsonian approach to verb semantics (Sanfilippo, 1990).
ways in which the representations derived from tem-
plates such as the one in (1) can be enriched. In the
simplest case, additional information can be recovered
from a single MRD source either directly or through
translation programs which allow the creation of derived
dictionaries where information which is somehow con-
tained in the source MRD can be made more explicit.
This technique may however be insufficient or inappro-
priate to recover certain kinds of information which are
necessary in building an adequate verb lexicon. Consider
the specification of verb class semantics. This is highly
instrumental in establishing subcategorization and reg-
imenting lexically governed grammatical processes (see
Levin (1989), Jackendoff (1990) and references therein)
and should be thus included within a lexicon which sup-
plied adequate information about verbs. For example, a
verb such as delight should be specified as a member of
the class of verbs which express emotion, i.e. psycholog-
ical verbs. As is well known (Levin, 1989; Jackendoff,
1990), verbs which belong to this semantic class can be
classified according to the following parameters:

ence, interest) or negative (fear, scare)

riencer as object, e.g. delight, interest, scam

<bodyText confidence="0.999564363636364">
Psychological verbs with experiencer subjects are &apos;non-
causative&apos;; the stimulus of these verbs can be considered
to be a &apos;source&apos; to which the experiencer &apos;reacts emo-
tively&apos;. By contrast, psychological verbs with stimulu:
subjects involve `causation&apos;; the stimulus argument ma3
be consided as a &apos;causative source&apos; by which the experi.
encer participant is &apos;emotively affected&apos;. Six subtypes o
psychological verbs can thus be distinguished accordinl
to semantic properties of the stimulus and experience
arguments as shown in (3) where the verb delight is spec
ified as belonging to one of these subtypes.

to derive a dictionary from LDOCE where verbs are or-
ganized into a network defined by IS-A links using the
general approach to taxonomy formation described by
Amsler (1981). Such an approach would involve the for-
mation of chains through verb definitions determined by
the genus term of each definition. Unfortunately, the
genus of verb definitions is often not specific enough to
supply a taxonomic characterization which allows for the
identification of semantic verb classes with consistency
and exhaustiveness. In LDOCE, for example, the genus
of over 20% of verb senses (about 3,500) is one of 8 verbs:
cause, make, be, give, put, take, move, have; many of
the word senses which have the same genus belong to
distinct semantic verb classes. This is not to say that
verb taxonomies are of no value, and in the final sec-
tion we will briefly discuss an important application of
verb taxonomies with respect to the assignment of se-
mantic classes to verb senses. Nevertheless, the achieve-
ment of adequate results requires techniques which re-
classify entries in the same source MRD(s) rather than
making explicit the classification &apos;implicit&apos; in the lexi-
cographer&apos;s choice of genus term. Thesauri provide an
alternative semantically-motivated classification of lexi-
cal items which is most naturally suited to reshape or
augment the taxonomic structure which can be inferred
from the genus of dictionary definitions. The LLOCE
is a thesaurus which was developed from LDOCE and
there is substantial overlap (although not identity) be-
tween the definitions and entries of both MRDs. We
decided to investigate the plausibility of semi-automatic
sense correlations with LDOCE and LLOCE and to ex-
plore the utility of the thesaurus classification for the
classification of verbs in a linguistically motivated way.

3 DCK: A Flexible Tool for Correlating
Word Senses Across MRDs
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999990588235294">
Our immediate goal in developing an environment for
correlating MRDs was thus to merge word senses, and in
particular verb senses, from LDOCE and LLOCE. More
generally, our aim was to provide a Dictionary Corre-
lation Kit (DCK) containing a set of flexible tools that
can be straightforwardly tailored to an individual user&apos;s
needs, along with a facility for the interactive match-
ing of dictionary entries. Our DCK is designed to cor-
relate word senses across pairs of MRDs which have
been mounted on the LDB (henceforth source-dict and
destination-dict) using a list of comparison heuristics.
Entries from the source-dict and destination-dict are
compared to yield a set of correlation structures which
describe matches between word senses in the two dictio-
naries. A function is provided that converts correlation
structures into entries of a derived dictionary which can
be mounted and queried on the LDB.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997711">
3.1 General Functionality of DCK
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999361823529412">
Entry fields in the source-dict and destination-dict are
compared by means of comparators. These are func-
tions which take as input normalized field information
extracted from the entries under analysis, and return
two values: a score indicating the degree to which the
two fields correlate, along with an advisory datum which
indicates what kind of action to take. The objective
of each match is to produce a correlation structure con-
sisting of a source-dict sense and a set of destination-dict
sense/score pairs representing possible matches. Prior to
converting correlation structures into derived dictionary
entries, the best match is selected for each correlation
structure on the basis of the comparator scores. When
there is ambiguity as to the best match, a correlation di-
alog window pops up that allows the user to peruse the
candidate matches and manually select the best match
(see Figure 3).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999527">
3.2 Customising DCK
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998585">
Two categories of information must be provided in order
to correlate a pair of new LDB-mounted dictionaries:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.96777725">
• functions which normalize dictionary-dependent
field values, and
• dictionary independent comparators which provide
matching heuristics.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999477714285714">
Field values describing the same information may be
labeled differently across dictionaries. For example, pro-
nouns may be tagged as Pron in the part-of-speech field
of one dictionary and Pronoun in part-of-speech field of
another dictionary. It is therefore necessary to provide
normalizing functions which convert dictionary-specific
field values into dictionary-independent ones which can
be compared using generic comparators.
Comparators take as arguments pairs of normalized
field values relative to the senses of the two MRDs un-
der comparison, and return a score associated with an
advisory datum which indicates the course of action to
be followed. The score and advisory datum provide an
index of the degree of overlap between the two senses.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999686">
3.3 Determining the Best Sense
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9759458">
A correlation structure contains a list of destination-dict
sense/score pairs which indicate possible matches with
the corresponding source-dict sense. The most appro-
priate match can be determined automatically using two
user-provided parameters:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9629765">
1. the threshold, which indicates the minimal accept-
able score that a comparator list must achieve for
automatic sense selection, and
2. the tolerance, which is the minimum difference be-
tween the top two scores that must be achieved if
the top sense with the highest score is to be selected.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.989899083333333">
The sense/score pair with the highest score is automat-
ically selected if:
A. the advisory datum provides no indication that the
correlation should be queried,
B. the score relative to a single match exceeds the
threshold, or
C. the score relative to two or more matches exceeds
the threshold, and the difference between the top
two scores exceeds the tolerance.
If either one of these conditions is not fulfilled, the cor-
relation dialog is invoked to allow a manual choice to be
made.

3.4 The Correlation Dialog
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.991231142857143">
The correlation dialog allows the user to examine correla-
tion structures and select none, one or more destination-
dict senses to be matched with the source-dict sense un-
der analysis. A typical interaction can be seen in Fig-
ure 3. A scrollable window in the centre of the dia-
log box provides information about the destination-dict
senses and their associated scores. Single clicking the
mouse button on one or more rows makes them the cur-
rent selection. The large button above the threshold and
tolerance indicators summarizes source-dict sense infor-
mation. Clicking on this button invokes an LDB query
window which inspects the source-dict sense (cf. bottom
left window in Figure 3).
The dialog can be in one of three modes:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.993270272727273">
• Explain Scores — the mode specific key pops up a
window for each destination-dict sense in the cur-
rent selection, explaining how each score was ob-
tained from the comparators;
• Display Entries — the mode specific key invokes
standard LDB browsers on the destination-dict
senses in the current selection (cf. top-left window
in Figure 3), and
• Accept Entries — the mode specific key terminates
the dialog and accepts the current selection as the
best match.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997345">
Two additional buttons on the top right of the dialog box
allow the current selection to be accepted independent
of the current mode, or all senses to be rejected (i.e.
no match is found). At the bottom of the screen, two
&apos;thermometers&apos; allow the user to adjust the threshold
and tolerance parameters dynamically.

grated thesaurus information from LLOCE. The work
was carried out with specific reference to verbs which
express &apos;Feelings, Emotions, Attitudes, and Sensations&apos;
and &apos;Movement, Location, Travel, and Transport&apos; (sets
&apos;F&apos; and &apos;M&apos; in LLOCE). Correlation structures were de-
rived for 1194 verb senses (over 1/5 of all verb senses in
LLOCE) using as matching parameters degree of overlap
in grammar codes, definitions and examples, as well as
equality in headword and part-of-speech. After some
trial runs, correlations appeared to yield best results
when all parameters were assigned the same weight ex-
cept the comparator for &apos;degree of overlap in examples&apos;
which was set to be twice as determinant than the oth-
ers. Tolerance was set at 7% and threshold at 65%. The
rate of interactions through the correlation dialog was
about one for every 8-10 senses. It took about 10 hours
running time on a Macintosh IIcx to complete the work,
with less than three hours&apos; worth of interactions.
A close examination of over 500 correlated entries dis-
closed an extremely low incidence of infelicitous matches
(below 1%). In some cases, sense-matching inadequacies
could be easily redressed without reassignment of corre-
lation links. For example, DCK erroneously correlated
the verb sense for float in LLOCE with the first verb
sense of float in LDOCE. As shown in (4), the LLOCE
sense refers only to the intransitive use of the verb, while
the LDOCE sense refers to both transitive and intransi-
tive uses of the verb (i.e. the LLOCE sense is subsumed

One way to redress this kind of inadequate match would
be to augment DCK with a lexical rule module cater-
ing for diathesis alternations which made it possible to
establish a clear relation between distinct syntactic re-
alizations of the same verb. For example, the transitive
and intransitive senses of float could be related to each
other via the &apos;causative/inchoative&apos; alternation. This
augmentation would be easy to implement since infor-
mation about amenability of verbs to diathesis alterna-
tions is recoverable from LDOCE_Inter, as shown below
for float (Ergative is the term used in LDOCE_Inter to
characterize verbs which like float are amenable to the
causative/inchoative alternation).

Notice, incidentally, that even though DCK yielded
an incorrect sense correlation for the verb entry float,
the information which was inherited by LDOCE from
LLOCE through the correlation link was still valid. In
LLOCE, float is classified as a verb whose set, group
and main identifiers are: floating-and-sinking, Shipping
and Movement-location-travel-and-transport. This infor-
mation is useful in establishing the semantic class of
both the transitive and intransitive uses of float. This
is also true in those rare cases where DCK incorrectly
preferred a sense match to another as shown below for
the first LLOCE sense of behave which DCK linked
to the third LDOCE sense rather than the first. Ei-
ther sense of behave is adequately characterized by the
set, group and main identifiers &apos;behaving&apos;, `Feeling-and-
behaviour-generally&apos;, and `Feelings-emotions-attitudes-
and-sensations&apos; which LDOCE inherits from LLOCE
through the incorrect sense correlation established by
DCK.

Loading LDOCE with LDOCE_Link makes it possible to
form LDOCE queries which include thesaurus informa-
tion from LLOCE (i.e. the set identifiers). The integra-
tion of thesaurus information provides adequate means
for developing a semantic classification of verbs. With
respect to psychological verbs, for example, the set iden-
tifiers proved to be very helpful in identifying members
of the six subtypes described in (3). The properties used
in this classification could thus be used to define a hierar-
chy of thematic types in the LKB which gave a detailed
characterization of argument roles. This is shown in the
lattice fragment in Figure 4 where the underlined types
correspond to the role types used to distinguish the six
semantic varieties of psychological predicates.3
The correspondence between LLOCE set identifiers
and the thematic role types shown in Figure 4 made it
possible to create word-sense templates for psychological
verbs from LDB queries which in addition to providing
information about morphological paradigm, subcatego-
rization patterns, diathesis alternations and selectional
restrictions, supplied thematic restrictions on the stimu-
lus and experiencer roles. Illustrative LKB entries rela-
tive to the six verb subtypes described in (3) are shown
in Figure 5.

Taking into consideration the size of the LLOCE frag-
ment correlated to LDOCE (1/5 of LLOCE verb senses)
and the results obtained, it seems reasonable to expect
that this work should extend straightforwardly to other
verbs as well as word senses of different category types.
As far as we were able to establish, the major limi-
tation of the work carried out arises from the fact that
the entries and senses per homonyn in the source dictio-
nary were considerably fewer than those in the destina-
tion dictionary (e.g. 16,049 entries with 25,100 senses
in LLOCE vs. 41,122 entries with 74,086 senses in
LDOCE). Consequently, many senses of correlated verb
entries as well as entire verb entries in LDOCE are bound
to be left without a specification of thesaurus informa-
tion. We are currently exploring the possibility of us-
ing verb taxonomies to extend the results of LLOCE-
LDOCE correlations to those LDOCE entries and verb

<abstract confidence="0.999368615384615">This paper is concerned with the question of how to extract lexical knowledge from Machine- Readable Dictionaries (MRDs) within a lexical database which integrates a lexicon development environment. Our long term objective is the creation of a large lexical knowledge base using semiautomatic techniques to recover syntactic and semantic information from MRDs. In doing so, one finds that reliance on a single MRD source induces inadequacies which could be efficiently redressed through access to combined MRD sources. In the general case, the integration of information from distinct MRDs remains a problem hard, perhaps impossible, to solve without the aid of a complete, linguistically motivated database which provides a reference point for comparison. Nevertheless, advances can be made by attempting to correlate dictionaries which are not too dissimilar. In keeping with these observations, we describe a software package for correlating MRDs based on sense merging techniques and show how such a tool can be employed in augmenting a lexical knowledge base built from a conventional MRD with thesaurus information.</abstract>

Such an approach would involve the formation of chains through verb definitions determined by the genus term of each definition. Unfortunately, the genus of verb definitions is often not specific enough to supply a taxonomic characterization which allows for the identification of semantic verb classes with consistency and exhaustiveness. In LDOCE, for example, the genus of over 20% of verb senses (about 3,500) is one of 8 verbs: cause, make, be, give, put, take, move, have; many of the word senses which have the same genus belong to distinct semantic verb classes.

For example, the information needed to build LKB representations for English verbs (see below) was partly obtained by running LDB queries which combined information from the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English (LDOCE) and two other dictionaries derived from LDOCE: LDOCE_Inter and LDOCE_Sem. LDOCE_Inter was derived by a translation program which mapped the grammar codes of LDOCE entries into theoretically neutral intermediate representations (Boguraev &amp; Briscoe, 1989; Carroll St Grover, 1989). LDOCE_Sem was derived by extracting genus terms from dictionary definitions in LDOCE (Alshawi, 1989; Vossen, 1990). Figure 1 provides an illustrative example of an LDB query which combines these MRD sources. We used these LDB facilities for running queries from combined MRD sources which included more than one MRD — i.e. LDOCE and the Longman Lexicon of Contemporary English (LLOCE), a thesaurus closely related to LDOCE. The LKB provides a lexicon development environment which uses a typed graph-based unification formalism as representation language. A detailed description of the LKB&apos;s representation language is given in papers by Copestake, de Paiva and Sanfilippo in Briscoe et al. (forthco</context>

In the general case, the integration of information from distinct MRD sources for use within a lexicon development environment is probably going to remain an unsolved problem for quite some time. This is simply because dictionaries seldom describe the same word using the same sense distinctions. Consequently, the integration of information from distinct MRD sources through simple word-sense matches is likely to fail in a significant number of instances (Calzolari &amp; Picchi, 1986; Atkins 1987; Klavans 1988; Boguraev &amp; Pustejovsky 1990). Indeed, Atkins &amp; Levin (1990) have suggested that the task of mapping MRDs onto each other is so complex that the creation of a complete &apos;ideal&apos; database which provides a reference point for the MRD sources to be integrated may well be considered as an essential prerequisite.

For example, the information needed to build LKB representations for English verbs (see below) was partly obtained by running LDB queries which combined information from the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English (LDOCE) and two other dictionaries derived from LDOCE: LDOCE_Inter and LDOCE_Sem. LDOCE_Inter was derived by a translation program which mapped the grammar codes of LDOCE entries into theoretically neutral intermediate representations (Boguraev &amp; Briscoe, 1989; Carroll St Grover, 1989). LDOCE_Sem was derived by extracting genus terms from dictionary definitions in LDOCE (Alshawi, 1989; Vossen, 1990).

The goal of this paper is to describe a software package for correlating word senses across dictionaries which can be straightforwardly tailored to an individual user&apos;s needs, and has convenient facilities for interactive sense matching. We also show how such a tool can be employed in augmenting a lexical knowledge base built from a conventional MRD with thesaurus information. 2 Background Our point of departure is the Lexical Data Base (LDB) and LKB tools developed at the Computer Laboratory in Cambridge within the context of the ACQUILEX project. The LDB (Carroll, 1990) gives flexible access to MRDs and is endowed with a graphic interface which provides a user-friendly environment for query formation and information retrieval. It allows several dictionaries to be loaded and queried in parallel. Figure 1: LDB query from combined MRD sources (a main MRD and two derived ones) Until recently, this facility has been used to extract information from combined MRD sources which included a main dictionary and a number of dictionaries derived from it.

This technique may however be insufficient or inappropriate to recover certain kinds of information which are necessary in building an adequate verb lexicon. Consider the specification of verb class semantics. This is highly instrumental in establishing subcategorization and regimenting lexically governed grammatical processes (see Levin (1989), Jackendoff (1990) and references therein) and should be thus included within a lexicon which supplied adequate information about verbs. For example, a verb such as delight should be specified as a member of the class of verbs which express emotion, i.e. psychological verbs. As is well known (Levin, 1989; Jackendoff, 1990), verbs which belong to this semantic class can be classified according to the following parameters: • affect is positive (admire, delight), neutral (experience, interest) or negative (fear, scare) • stimulus argument is realized as object and experiencer as subject, e.g. ad</context>

LDOCE_Inter was derived by a translation program which mapped the grammar codes of LDOCE entries into theoretically neutral intermediate representations (Boguraev &amp; Briscoe, 1989; Carroll St Grover, 1989). LDOCE_Sem was derived by extracting genus terms from dictionary definitions in LDOCE (Alshawi, 1989; Vossen, 1990). Figure 1 provides an illustrative example of an LDB query which combines these MRD sources. We used these LDB facilities for running queries from combined MRD sources which included more than one MRD — i.e. LDOCE and the Longman Lexicon of Contemporary English (LLOCE), a thesaurus closely related to LDOCE. The LKB provides a lexicon development environment which uses a typed graph-based unification formalism as representation language. A detailed description of the LKB&apos;s representation language is given in papers by Copestake, de Paiva and Sanfilippo in Briscoe et al. (forthcoming); various </context>
