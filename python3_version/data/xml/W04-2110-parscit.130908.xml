Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999806">
A very large Russian dictionary is described.
It contains currently 3.6 million links between
its 120,000 entries. The links are syntagmatic
(collocations), paradigmatic (WordNet-like),
or paronymic (words similar in letters or in
morphs). The entries of the dictionary are sin-
gle- or multiwords belonging to four main
POS. The entries represent so-called gram-
memes rather than lexemes: e.g., nouns are
represented as singular and plural; verbs are
split into ‘finite forms + infinitive’, ‘participle’,
and ‘gerund’. The multiword entries in turn
can be collocations—idiomatic free—whose
parts are also entries of the same dictionary.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.990654042682928">
The entries of modern dictionaries are usually lex-
emes, and semantic relations between lexemes are
only morphological derivates of the entry. E.g.,
Webster’s Universal College Dictionary of English
gives with manufacture also manufacturable,
manufactural, and manufacturer, having no entry.
A rather specialized exception is WordNet (Fell-
baum, 1998). It gives paradigmatic semantic links:
synonymous (common gloss), antonymous (com-
mon presupposed meaning, opposite assertion),
XPOS links (same meaning, different POS), etc.
Other exceptions are BBI (Benson et al., 1986)
and much vaster OCDSE (OCDSE, 2003), both
existing only in printed form. They give colloca-
tions, i.e. stable and idiomatic word combinations
connected by both syntactic (immediate or through
auxiliary words) and semantic links, specifically of
syntagmatic type (e.g., a verb and its valence fillers,
a noun with its modifiers, etc.).
The entries are usually single words, whereas
general linguistics also suggests multiwords, which
may be both inseparable idiomatic concepts like
hot dog or point of view and closely tied and fre-
quently used terms like routs of communications.
This paper shortly outlines a very large elec-
tronic dictionary with the following main features:
– It adheres to the grammemic principle of selec-
tion of entries. Grammemes are subsets of mor-
phological paradigms of lexemes, i.e. they are
between lexemes and wordforms. E.g., noun
lexemes are represented by two grammemes:
singular and plural; verb lexemes are split into
finite forms + infinitive, participle, and gerund.
– Its entries are only content (semantically
autonomous) single and multiwords; the latter
can be additionally represented by links be-
tween their components (this can be called de-
composition principle of entry formation).
Auxiliary words are stored as an auxiliary part
of the dictionary, e.g., as a list of prepositions.
– It includes links of three vast classes: semantic
syntagmatic (as in OCDSE), semantic para-
digmatic (as in WordNet), and paronymic. The
latter class is new in dictionaries: it connects
entries similar in letters (e.g., sigh vs. sign) or
in morphs (e.g., sensible vs. sensitive).
The dictionary is the result of CrossLexica pro-
ject (Bolshakov, 2004; Bolshakov and Gelbukh,
2000) and is mainly oriented to collocations.
Specifically, the objectives of this paper are:
– To describe possible options and features for
the dictionary entries;
– To characterize types of the links: syntagmatic,
paradigmatic, and paronymic;
– To prove language independence of the
CrossLexica structure;
– To statistically characterize CrossLexica dic-
tionary in its present state.
We use English examples for the illustrations.
2 Types and Features of Entries
Wordforms are grouped together into dictionary
entries basing on several important features:
Parts of speech It can be any of the four main
POS. The POS is defined according to the syntac-
tic role: participles are considered adjectival; a
prepositional phrase can be adjectival or adverbial,
e.g., in substance is adjectival in unconstitutional-
ity in substance (≈ ‘substantial’) and adverbial in to
verify in substance (≈ ‘substantially’). We consider
such two-functional entries homonymous.
Grammemes For a Russian noun, the singular
and plural have their own collocations. Printed dic-
tionaries mark this as mainly plural or the like. So
we split the morphoparadigm of a noun to singular
and plural, calling such sub-paradigms grammemes.
Based on their syntactic roles, we divide mor-
phoparadigms of verbs into the grammemes of par-
ticiples (adjectival), gerunds (adverbial), and per-
sonal forms plus infinitives (predicates).
Russian verbs have two aspects differing in their
combinability: the perfect tends to collocate with
singular nouns, the imperfect being indifferent to
number; the perfect is usually modified with ‘con-
centrated’ adverbials like suddenly, at once or
straightway, the imperfect preferring ‘spread’ ad-
verbials like gradually, continuously or repeatedly.
So we split verbs into aspectual grammemes.
Homonyms We consider various homonyms
separately. Their combinatorial differences are es-
pecially useful for word sense disambiguation.
Idioms Idiomatic collocations like point of
view are entries, since combinability of an idiom is
always different from that of its head. Their com-
ponents can, though, be also entries on their own.
Multiwords If a non-idiomatic multiword has
a single-word synonym, we treat it as an entry,
since its combinability differs from that of its head.
E.g., Rus. puti soobščenija ‘routes of communica-
tions’ has a synonym kommunikacii. Cf. a similar
problem in EuroWordNet (Vossen, 2000).
Absolute synonyms, abbreviations, and mor-
phological variants Absolute synonyms (sofa =
settee) are very rare in any language, but there are
other types of equivalence: abbreviations (United
States of America = USA = United States) and the
so-called morphological variants (e.g., Rus. nul’ =
nol’ ‘zero’ or mučat’ = mučit’ ‘to torture’). Since
all their collocations are the same, we store them as
one entry, selecting one of them as a representative.
Paste-ups Many Russian noun-headed con-
cepts are used in two equivalent forms: (1) a bi-
gram consisting of a modifier with the stem S, plus
its head noun with the stem S2, or (2) a single noun
containing the stems S, and S2, or their initial parts,
or only S,: električeskij tok ‘electrical current’ =
elektrotok; fizičeskij fakul’tet ‘physical faculty’ =
fizfak; komičeskij akter ‘comical actor’ = komik.
The number of the paste-ups grows, especially in
the newswire and everyday speech, but in diction-
aries they are scarce. Our dictionary stores about
three thousand of them in both forms.
Compound pairs Russian has numerous sta-
ble pairs of nouns separated by a dash, usually with
both parts declinable in parallel: strana-učastnica
‘participant country’, letčik-ispytatel’ ‘test pilot’,
zavod-izgotovitel’ ‘manufacturing plant’. A com-
pound pair is considered an entry.
Coordinated pairs Dependency links within
multiwords can be of stable coordinative type:
mother and father, safe and sound, sooner or later.
We consider such pairs as both collocations (with
syntagmatic links) and separate entries. E.g., each
bracketed item of the term [[[probability] [theory]]
and [[mathematical] [statistics]]] is an entry.
Synonyms, hyperonyms/hyponyms, and anto-
nyms These are semantically paradigmatic links.
We take their participants as entries.
Proper names We consider as entries those
names that are a part of everyday life and encyclo-
paedic knowledge: names of geographic objects,
countries, famous persons, large organizations, etc.
They are linked to their hyperonyms: country,
mountains, island, writer, organization, etc.
Semantic derivates These are lexemes of any
POS with same basic meaning, e.g., to marry, mar-
riage, bride, bridegroom, and matrimonial (XPOS
in WordNet). We take such words as entries.
Idiomaticity in general All complete idioms
are included as collocations, e.g., sest’  |v galošu
‘to get  |into a fix’, lit. ‘to sit  |into a galosh’. In
rarer cases of tripartite idioms the dichotomy was
merely a practical step; e.g. in byt’  |bez carja v
golove ‘to be stupid’, lit. ‘to be  |without the Tsar
in one’s head’, we regard the right part as a modi-
fier. Two marks are used: idiom and possible id-
iom, the latter for collocations with both figurative
and direct senses, e.g., sest’ v lužu means ‘to get
into a mess’ or ‘to sit down into a puddle’.
Usage marks Special, bookish or obsolete: the
use in writing is recommended if the meaning is
clear to the writer; colloquial: the use in official
writing is not recommended; vulgar: both written
and oral use are prohibited; and incorrect: used
sometimes but contradicts language norms.

3 Types of Syntagmatic Links
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999515321428571">
We define a collocation as a syntactically con-
nected and semantically compatible pair of content
words, like full-length dress, well expressed, to
briefly expose, to pick up the knife or to listen to
the radio (collocation components are underlined).
Syntactical connectedness is understood as in
dependency grammars (Mel’čuk, 1995) (maybe
through an auxiliary word), not as co-occurrence
(Bentivogli and Pianta, 2002); the components can
be distant in the sentence. We consider colloca-
tions from absolutely free to purely idiomatic. The
following are collocation types.
Modifiers These are modifying or attributive
components: great &lt;— country; man → of letters;
eat → quickly; enormously &lt;— big; very &lt;— well.
Verbs with their subjects The subject is a
specific dependent of a predicate verb: soldier &lt;—
died; bus &lt;— arrives. A specifically Russian type of
the subject-to-predicate link is a predicate contain-
ing the copula byt’ ‘to be’ (omitted in Russian in
present tense) and an adjectival in short form: god
← zaveršen (participle) ‘the year is over’; vek ←
korotok (adjective) ‘the lifetime is short’.
Verbs with their noun complements Noun
complements of a verb are all nouns dependent on
the verb as direct, indirect, or prepositional object:
to read a book; to strive for peace. We also con-
sider as complements circumstantial phrases like to
travel by train. A word can have several comple-
ments; each collocation reflects one of them, while
the omission of other obligatory complement(s) is
marked with the ellipsis: to give ... to the boy.
Nouns / adjectivals with their noun comple-
ments All POS can have noun complements, e.g.,
nouns the capital of the country, the struggle
against poverty; adjectives blind with rage, men-
tioned by the observer or going to the cinema.
Verbs / nouns / adjectivals with their infini-
tive complements E.g. to stop to talk or to per-
mit to enter; permission to enter or cream to pro-
tect; forced to return or ready to appeal.
Adverbials with their infinitive complements
These are purely Russian collocations: xolodno idti
‘it is cold to go’, lit. ‘coldly to go’; reshiv (gerund)
idti ‘after having decided to go’. They are possible
only with some predicative adverbs or gerunds.
Adverbials with noun complements Purely
Russian: xolodno (adverb) bez pal’to ‘it is cold
without a coat’, lit. ‘coldly without a coat’; poby-
vav (gerund) v centre ‘after visiting the center’.
Verbs / adjectivals with their adjectival com-
plements E.g., to remain silent or to consider...
stupid; remaining silent or considering ... stupid.
Coordinated pairs E.g. mom and dad, safe
and sound, or sooner or later, cf. (Bolshakov et al.,
2003b) for details.

4 Types of Paradigmatic Links
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98396019047619">
These semantic (WordNet-like) links are:
Synonyms Unlike WordNet synsets, our syn-
onymy groups have a dominant member and may
include member(s) marked as its absolute syno-
nyms. Synonyms can be periphrastic multiwords or
even short definitions: to help ≈ to give help; fall ≈
quick descent; suffocation ≈ lack of fresh air. Non-
absolute synonyms can be used for heuristic infer-
ences of new collocations from those existing in
the dictionary (Bolshakov and Gelbukh, 2002a).
Hyponyms vs. hyperonyms Hyperonyms are
also used for such inferences.
Antonyms Together with standard antonyms
(goodbad, vanguardrearguard), we consider
opposite notions: missilesantimissiles.
Meronyms vs. holonyms E.g. fingerhand,
motorcar.
Semantic derivates They connect parts of the
morphoparadigms split into grammemes. Also,
they describe the same idea from various aspects,
thus compensating for the lack of glosses.

<sectionHeader confidence="0.646111" genericHeader="method">
5 Types of Paronymic Links
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.959402444444444">
The types of such links are as follows:
Literal paronyms They are at the distance of
few editing operations (replacement, omission,
insertion, permutation of adjacent letters) from
each other. E.g., for sign: sigh, sin, sing. They are
useful, e.g., to correct the malapropisms (Bolsha-
kov and Gelbukh, 2003a).
Morphemic paronyms They are of the same
POS and radix but have different prefixes and/or
suffixes, e.g., sens-ation-al, sens-ible, in-sens-ible,
sens-itive, sens-less, sens-ual. Foreigners’ mala-
propisms are often confusion of morphemic paro-
nyms, so that we can immediately propose candi-
dates for correcting such errors.
Auxiliary parts of CrossLexica is a Russian-
English-Russian dictionary (e.g., by two English
words, the user can find a fluent Russian colloca-
tion), and a generator of all morphological forms.

6 Interlingual Structural Universality
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999123368421053">
The system operates with two main data structures:
a list of entries and a set of links between them. An
entry contains a list of its morphological categories.
This structure is language-independent.
The specific links between entries can, however,
be language specific. Let us outline grammatical
peculiarities of Russian that influence these links.
Nouns and adjectivals declinable In English
this problem does not exist.
Too few tenses Russian verbs have only three
tenses, whereas English has many.
No articles For other languages, it is important
to specify the forms of articles in collocations.
Nouns cannot modify nouns In English the
collocations like book review are quite common. A
special attributive type of syntagmatic links should
be introduced for such English collocations.
Thus the Cross-Lexica structure is (almost) lin-
guistically universal.

7 CrossLexica Statistics and Some Discussion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.960959538461539">
As of April 2004, the dictionary contains more
than 120,000 entries. Collocations are divided into
three classes: primary, secondary, and inferred.
The primary collocations are collected manually.
The secondary collocations result from automatic
morphological transformations of the primary ones.
For example, verbs with their noun complements
are transformed into adjectivals with their noun
eration and segmentation (2001a); revealing text
cohesion (Gelbukh et al., 2000), steganography.
complements, e.g., to participate in the meeting
gives participating in the meeting.

The inferences are performed with constraints
(Bolshakov and Gelbukh, 2002a), e.g., the source
collocation cannot be an idiom, to avoid the infer-
ence like (hot dog);d;om &amp; (poodle IS_A dog) →
*(hot poodle). The total of the inferred collocations
never exceeded 6 to 8% of the primaries and is
declining because the rare species are getting a full
description within the primaries.
In Table 2, other link statistics are given. All
links are counted, e.g., n antonyms pairs give 2n
unilateral links, and a group of n synonyms gives
n(n–1)/2. The total is more than 1.2 million. Thus,
the total of links of the three classes is 3.6 million.

A dictionary of a new type was developed. Its main
features are:
– Entries belong only to nouns, verbs, adjectives
and adverbs; they are grammemes (i.e. parts of
lexemes) and can be multiwords.
– The links between entries are of semantic (syn-
tagmatic or paradigmatic) or paronymic class.
– Its structure is interlingually universal.
Such dictionaries have a vast specter of applica-
tions: language learning (Bolshakov and Gelbukh,

Also, they describe the same idea from various aspects, thus compensating for the lack of glosses. 5 Types of Paronymic Links The types of such links are as follows: Literal paronyms They are at the distance of few editing operations (replacement, omission, insertion, permutation of adjacent letters) from each other. E.g., for sign: sigh, sin, sing. They are useful, e.g., to correct the malapropisms (Bolshakov and Gelbukh, 2003a). Morphemic paronyms They are of the same POS and radix but have different prefixes and/or suffixes, e.g., sens-ation-al, sens-ible, in-sens-ible, sens-itive, sens-less, sens-ual. Foreigners’ malapropisms are often confusion of morphemic paronyms, so that we can immediately propose candidates for correcting such errors.

Thus the Cross-Lexica structure is (almost) linguistically universal. 7 CrossLexica Statistics and Some Discussion As of April 2004, the dictionary contains more than 120,000 entries. Collocations are divided into three classes: primary, secondary, and inferred. The primary collocations are collected manually. The secondary collocations result from automatic morphological transformations of the primary ones. For example, verbs with their noun complements are transformed into adjectivals with their noun eration and segmentation (2001a); revealing text cohesion (Gelbukh et al., 2000), steganography. complements, e.g., to participate in the meeting gives participating in the meeting.

The multiword entries in turn can be collocations—idiomatic free—whose parts are also entries of the same dictionary. 1 Introduction The entries of modern dictionaries are usually lexemes, and semantic relations between lexemes are only morphological derivates of the entry. E.g., Webster’s Universal College Dictionary of English gives with manufacture also manufacturable, manufactural, and manufacturer, having no entry. A rather specialized exception is WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998). It gives paradigmatic semantic links: synonymous (common gloss), antonymous (common presupposed meaning, opposite assertion), XPOS links (same meaning, different POS), etc. Other exceptions are BBI (Benson et al., 1986) and much vaster OCDSE (OCDSE, 2003), both existing only in printed form. They give collocations, i.e. stable and idiomatic word combinations connected by both syntactic (immediate or through auxiliary words) and semantic links, specifically of syntagmatic type (e.g., a verb and its valence fillers, a noun with its modifiers, etc.).

Their combinatorial differences are especially useful for word sense disambiguation. Idioms Idiomatic collocations like point of view are entries, since combinability of an idiom is always different from that of its head. Their components can, though, be also entries on their own. Multiwords If a non-idiomatic multiword has a single-word synonym, we treat it as an entry, since its combinability differs from that of its head. E.g., Rus. puti soobščenija ‘routes of communications’ has a synonym kommunikacii. Cf. a similar problem in EuroWordNet (Vossen, 2000). Absolute synonyms, abbreviations, and morphological variants Absolute synonyms (sofa = settee) are very rare in any language, but there are other types of equivalence: abbreviations (United States of America = USA = United States) and the so-called morphological variants (e.g., Rus. nul’ = nol’ ‘zero’ or mučat’ = mučit’ ‘to torture’). Since all their collocations are the same, we store them as one entry, selecting one of them as a representative.
