<bodyText confidence="0.999855555555555">
There is a type of nominal ellipsis that has
been neglected in the study of ellipsis
resolution. Certain sentence constructions,
observed in diverse languages, tend to disguise
the existence of ellipsis - due to an anomalous
case assignment that assigns the nominative
case to what is not typically the subject. This
phenomenon deserves attention, for the
referent of such an ellipsis is the agent of the
sentence that carries vital information for
Question Answering. Furthermore, as many
languages including English do not use these
constructions, resolution of such ellipses is of
importance for Machine Translation and other
multilingual applications. This paper presents
a method to detect such disguised ellipses and
to resolve them as well as common ellipses in
a unified manner

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999969536585366">
The study of nominal ellipsis resolution differs
significantly from that of pronominal and other
anaphoric resolution with the view that ellipsis in
its own right has null morphology, and hence the
detection of ellipsis is an additional task.
Consequently, much work on nominal ellipsis
resolution has focused on resolving syntactically
missing arguments, i.e. implicit subjects, and to a
much lesser extent, objects and indirect objects.
Since the subject is the most frequent and usually
the most semantically significant argument, this
focus is legitimate. Even so, current research is still
challenged by the prospect of adequately
accounting for even subject ellipsis. Needless to
say, there have been attempts to resolve other types
of nominal ellipsis, such as lexical nouns, indirect
anaphors, and exophora (Mitkov 2002).
This paper is an elaboration of the paper
(Nariyama 2003a) that raised another type of
ellipsis whose resolution has been hitherto
neglected, presumably because the existence of
this type of ellipsis is even more inconspicuous
than those ellipses that have been studied. It occurs
in some constructions, which appear to be
syntactically complete but are in actuality missing
an agent. Hence, this disguised ellipsis is referred
to as &apos;incognito&apos; ellipsis. As the agent is the key
nominal constituent that is informationally vital,
particularly in applications for Question
Answering and Machine Translation systems, it
deserves attention and sound analysis.
The rest of this paper is organised as follows.
Section 2 lays out background of the phenomenon.
Section 3 examines the aspect of detecting such
ellipses. For acheiving this task, it discusses the
process of creating a list of argument taking
nominals in order to alleviate the problems arising
from word sense disambiguations inherent in the
semantics of verbs. Finally, Section 4 presents a
method for resolving incognito ellipses as well as
common ellipses in a unified manner.

The constructions that contain &apos;incognito&apos;
ellipsis are observed in diverse languages, such as
Spanish, Russian, Latin, Japanese, Turkish, and
Old English (Shibatani, 1982:106). The following
examples from Japanese newspaper articles
demonstrate the point.&apos; Both (1) and (2) appear
syntactically complete, containing all
subcategorised arguments, including, and most
importantly, the subject of the sentence. However,
semantically there is a missing agent. Indeed, in
languages, such as English, an overt expression of
the agent is required, as demonstrated by the fact
that the literal translation of these sentences
produces peculiar English sentences. The natural
English translation (shown by the arrows —&gt;)
requires a specification of the agent that is not
expressed in the Japanese sentences; namely, &apos;who
has the intention&apos; in (1) and &apos;who does not
understand&apos; in (2). In other words, despite its
nominative marking that prototypically denotes the
subject, the nominatively marked nominal is
essentially the object of the sentence.
</bodyText>

(2) Shin &apos;i-ga wakara-nai.

(lit.) &apos;The real intention is not understandable.&apos;
—&gt; `o don&apos;t understand the real intention of o.&apos;
Analogously, Spanish expresses (1) and (2) as

(3) Hay intencion de visi tar Bosnia.
Exist intention of visit Bosnia
(lit.) &apos;Intention of visiting Bosnia exists&apos;.
(4) No se sabe cual es la verdadera intenciOn

(lit.) &apos;The true intention is not known itself.&apos;
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999589676470588">
Subject ellipsis is prevalent in Spanish and many
other European languages, and ellipsis resolution is
achieved commonly by verbal inflection reflecting
number, person and gender of subject ellipsis.
However, the verb hay in (3) has no agreement
with the syntactic subject, intencion. Moreover,
analogous to Japanese examples, intenciOn
functions more like the object. Indeed, it takes an
accusative pronoun when pronominalised. The
same applies to (4).
This type of construction and ellipsis is
prevalent, at least in Japanese (12% of clauses are
of this type, and 87% of those incognito agents are
implicit; see Table 1 in Section 2.2).
As demonstrated above, a problem is posed by
the fact that many languages, including English, do
not utilse those constructions, and require overt
expression of the referent that is incognito in those
languages which use &apos;incognito ellipsis&apos;
constructions. Hence, the recognition and
resolution of such ellipses is of importance
particularly in multilingual applications including
Machine Translation, and in Question Answering
and Information Retrieval for capturing the agent.
This paper focuses on the phenomenon seen in
Japanese. There have been numerous papers on
resolving Japanese ellipsis (Nakaiwa et al. 1995;
Walker et al. 1994; Kameyama, 1985; inter alia). A
book by Mazuka and Nagai (eds.) (1995) collects
14 papers addressing different aspects of Japanese
sentences from the point of view of sentence
processing. However, the phenomenon of
&apos;incognito ellipsis&apos; raised in this paper is not dealt
with in those papers.

2.1 Agent disguising constructions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993178">
Some constructions disguise an agent even in
English. This is summarised as follows:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.974925">
I. Intransitive constructions (e.g. 5b)
II. Passive constructions (e.g. 6b)
III. Constructions with pleonastic pronoun (e.g. 7)
IV. Existential constructions (e.g. 1,3,8,9)
V. Nominative object constructions (e.g. 2,4)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9990984">
The following pairs of sentences show that
transitive sentences can be alternated with
intransitive and passive sentences, in effect
reducing the valency of the sentence, i.e. in (5b)
and (6b) the agent is not expressed:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.978075">
(5a) I opened the door.
(5b) The door opened.
(6a) I held a meeting yesterday.
(6b) A meeting was held yesterday (by me).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999458375">
These types of constructions and their
relationship with the corresponding transitive
sentences that are also observed in English are well
documented; hence this is not the problem that this
paper is addressing. Similarly, in the third
constructions (see 7), the agent is non-specific,
generic or obfuscated and the implicit agent of
&apos;resolve&apos; is not generally treated as elliptical.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.457795">
(7) It is difficult to resolve pronominal anaphors.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999959">
The problem is posed by the next two types of
constructions. The fourth type is the existential
constructions, &amp;quot;There is/are ... .&amp;quot; in English. In
Japanese and many other languages, this type of
construction is also used to express one&apos;s
possession, in which case the possessor needs be
identified when implicit, for example:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.854694">
(8) 0 Imooto-ga iru.
sister-SB exist/be
(lit.) `A/my sister exists. / There is a sister.&apos;
—&gt; &apos;o have a sister.&apos;
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.942195333333333">
(8) appears complete syntactically, as it has the
subject in the intransitive sentence. However,
analogous to (1), semantically there is a missing
possessor. As can be seen, the literal English
translation of the Japanese sentence, `A/my sister
exists&apos; or &apos;There is a sister&apos;, may be grammatical
but strange or carry another meaning. English
expresses the proposition by the &apos;have&apos;
construction, i.e. &apos;I have a sister.&apos;
Discourse structure has a bearing on the
differences. The existential constructions in
English provide background information into a
discourse by introducing a new indefinite referent
(Insua 2003). Thus, anaphoric referents tend not to
be expressed by those constructions. However, this
is not the case in Japanese; the existential
constructions express anaphoric referents, which
are often implicit. In other words, the same
sentence construction may convey different
anaphoric information in different languages.
Furthermore, (8) can express the physical
presence of a &apos;sister&apos; as in English. This can be
distinguished to a greater extent by the presence of
locational or temporal adverbs, as in &apos;My sister is
over there now,&apos; in which case it is a prototypical
existential sentence and there is no ellipsis,
conceding that nonetheless the precise distinction
between the two meanings must be investigated
more precisely.
The fifth is the nominative object constructions,
of the kind that are not observed in modern
English. In these constructions, the prototypical
subject is marked by the dative (-iii, (or -de, -ga)
in Japanese) or the topic marker (-wa), while the
prototypical object is marked by the nominative (-
ga), which predominantly marks the subject, hence
the name &apos;nominative object&apos; (Nom0B). That is,
having a construction of: IN-wa/ga/ni(wa)/de(wa)
Y-ga Verbal] (Verbal: verbs, adjectives, or
nominal adjectives).
For both the existential constructions and the
nominative object constructions, the problem arises
from the fact that X is often implicit and only IY-
sBga Verbal] is overtly expressed, missing an
agent. Hence, syntactically it is difficult to detect
the existence of the agent.
Things are further complicated, in that some
constructions can involve two ellipses (see §3.2):
(9) Denwa-ga atta.
telephone-SB existed
(lit.) &apos;There was a call (for X from Z).&apos;
&apos;(Z) called (X).&apos;
Figure 1 summarises the two types of argument

(1, 2, 8) and Double (9). Section 3 examines the

Table 1 shows that in total 333 ellipses are found
in 520 clauses; 0 on average every sentence

incognito ellipses; and 0 the incognito agents are
ellipted on average 87.3%. In other words, 12.1%
(63/520) of clauses form the constructions that

ellipted; and 16.5% of all ellipses derive from
those constructions.
As a further reference, (2) was translated into
English using two machine translation systems, to
ascertain how sentences under the constructions
are currently translated. As resolution of ellipsis
requires contextual information, the referent and
context are added to (2) to make (10). The
translated sentences reveal that &apos;real intention&apos; is
treated as the subject of the sentence, and the
incognito agent is not resolved.

It is cutomery to subcategorise arguments from
the semantics of verbals. However, it is apperant
from (12) and (12a) that the semantics of the
nominative object as well as the verbal must be
accounted for to capture constructions with
incognito ellipsis. (12a) has the same verbal and
identical surface structure to (12), but (12a) does
not contain ellipsis.
Note that some nominative objects, as in (2),
require a possessor, which is also implicit, since
marking of the determiner is not grammatically
required in Japanese (see the studies on (A no) B
13 (of A)&apos; and `a/the B&apos; by Bond 2001, Murata and
Nagao 1999). Sentences such as (2) are included in
Single incognito ellipsis construction despite
having two incognito ellipses, because of their
construction type that belongs to Single incognito
ellipsis construction rather than Double.

Given these complications despite the linguistic
cues, it is formidably difficult to automatically and
reliably detect implicit agents and possessors from
the semantics alone, and to differentiate those
sentences that involve incognito ellipsis from those
that do not (such as proto-typical intransitive/
existential sentences). So a list of argument taking
nominals in addition to verbal subcategorisation
will help to detect and resolve incognito ellipsis,
and alleviate the problems arising from word
polysemy (hence the need for word sense
disambiguations) inherent in the semantics of
verbals.
A study is underway to examine approximately
6000 verbals in Goi-taikei (Japanese lexicon
dictionary, Ikehara et al. 1997), using the linguistic
cues to single out lexica that involve incognito
arguments, and then manually reexamine the
lexica. This will be followed by the examination of
nominals for the semantic attributes of nominative
objects.

as seen in (9). The occurrence of this structure is
not limited with the existential verbs, for instance:

Analogous to Single incognito ellipsis
construction, whether or not a verb subcategorises
for two participants X and Z as well as nominative
object Y depends essentially upon the semantics of
not only the verb but also Y. So, for example,
Kuruma-ga kita &apos;A car came&apos; is an intransitive
sentence without X and Z (save location), and its
only difference with (13) is the type of Y. Thus,
another list of argument taking nominals needs to
be created in order to alleviate the problems of
word sense disambiguations.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.5525115">
3.2.1 Creating a list of argument taking
nominals
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999976920634921">
This subsection categorises the types of verb and
nominative object Y, which saves work from
examining all verbs and nouns in creating this list.
First, apart from the existential verbs, the motion
verbs are typically of this type that subcategorise
two arguments. So the motion verbs are examined
using Goi-taikei thesauraus. The interim report on
the examination suggests that there are only
handful of motion verbs that takes two participants
X and Z. They are: kuru &apos;to come&apos;, todoku &apos;to
arrive&apos;, oriru &apos;to be granted&apos;, and hairu &apos;to enter&apos;.
These verbs are centripetal, having a deictic center
and the movement is directed towards the center.
Other motion verbs are not of this type for two
reasons. One is that they have a movement but do
not have the deictic center; for example, tobu &apos;to
fly&apos; and susumu &apos;to proceed&apos;. The other is
centrifugal, iku &apos;to go&apos; and wataru &apos;to cross&apos;,
whose movement goes away from the center,
which requires a different treatment from the
centripetal verbs.
Secondly, those nominative objects Y that
subcategorise X and Z are commonly communica-
tions related words, such as renraku &apos;contact&apos; and
tegami &apos;letter&apos; and benefactive, such as okurimono
&apos;gift&apos; and oiwai &apos;celebratory gift&apos;. Lexically they
are generally Chinese originated verbal nouns
(sahen meishi), such as denwa &apos;phone call&apos;,
deriving from &apos;to call&apos; and henji &apos;reply&apos; deriving
from &apos;to reply&apos;, and verbal nouns, such as sasoi
&apos;invitation&apos; and moshide &apos;offer&apos;. These Y involve
two people or organisations that represent people
in it. So, for example, &apos;offer&apos; must involve two
people: one who makes an offer and the other who
receives the offer.
Goi-taikei thesauraus and 4158 verbal nouns are
being examined for making a list of two-argument
taking nominals. In addition, sentences collected
from a newspaper corpus are being examined for
their collocations. The difficulty of this analysis is
due to the fact that only overt nominals are listed,
i.e. ellipsis is not indicated. So having no contexts
in the corpus, this approach takes a lot of
inferencing.
Given the facts that the verb imposes selectional
restrictions on the type of Y (i.e. each verb selects
different Y, although kuru &apos;to come&apos; and aru &apos;to
be&apos; can be combined with most Y) and the Y in
turn does the same to X and Z, and that there are
only handful of the verbs, it pays to make a list of
argument structures in the form of IX Verbl as a
set consitituent with specified lexica. This will
further alleviate the problems of word sense
disambiguations.
Owing to those semantic restrictions, Double
incognito ellipsis construction tends to appear
frequently on the topic of communications and gift
giving. For example, the news about the Japanese
hostages in Iraq (April 2004) innumerably used the
constructions reporting the communications among
the people detaining the hostages, their religious
leader, the Japanese embassy in Iraq and the
Japanese government in Japan.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.5582305">
3.2.2 Linguistic mechanisms for differentiating
two arguments
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9978738">
Resolving the two arguments X and Z is
problematic, in that since the semantic attributes of
both X and Z are identical, typically referring to
humans and the like, ellipsis resolution of this type
is unwieldy under the systems relying solely on
selectional restrictions, and may be unreliable with
stochastic models alone. Hence, more detailed
linguistic mechanisms behind the constructions
that bear incognito ellipsis should be investigated
for better ellipsis resolution.
Why is it that those constructions are used
instead of transitive sentences, namely, `(Z) called
(X)&apos; for (9), and `(Z) sent a report (to X)&apos; for (13)?
Nariyama (2003b) identifies the reasons to be the
organisation of discourse structure. She has
proposed a set of principles applicable to Japanese
that captures the pattern of ellipsis (Principle of
ellipsis), which in turn is governed by the structure
of sentences (Principle of direct alignment).
Japanese sentences are structured in such a way
as to express an argument high in animacy
[1&gt;2&gt;3&gt;animate&gt;inanimatel and discourse
salience (topicality/prior mention) as the subject.
In other words, a subject must be higher than non-
subject arguments (SB&gt;nonSB) in terms of
animacy and discourse salience. So for example, &apos;I
called my husband&apos;, which has a first person
subject and a third person object, i.e. [1—&gt;3]
forming a direct alignment, is acceptable. On the
other hand, the reverse, &apos;My husband called me&apos;,
([3—&gt;11) violates the principle of direct alignment,
and indeed the sentence sounds unusual and
infelicitous in Japanese, although it is acceptable in
English. Instead, the proposition is often expressed
using the existential construction, &apos;There was a call
for me from my husband&apos; as in (9); i.e., using
Double incognito ellipses construction.
Conversely, the existential construction cannot be
used for sentences with direct alignment, i.e.
&apos;There was a call for my husband from me.&apos; In
other words, the construction type signals the
relationship between X and Z. The use of the
existential (i.e. intransitive) construction signals
that, in the case of (9), the caller Z is lower than
the receiver X of the call in terms of animacy and
discourse salience, while a transitive sentence
signals that the caller is higher than the receiver.
This restructuring process is formulated in
Figure 3, which is built into the makeup of the
algorithm presented in Section 4.1.

Based on the principles, four ellipses in (14) are
easily resolved without resort to commonsense
knowledge or the cause-effect logic. The
subordinate clause is a transitive sentence, so the
agent is higher than the recepient in terms of
person or discourse salience, while the matrix
clause is intransitive so the agent is lower. This
leads to the correct reading indicated.

&apos;When (I) contacted (him), (he) sent (me) reply.&apos;
The claim that sentences that violate the
principle of direct alignment are restructured into
the existential or nominative object constructions
(i.e. intransitive sentences) is verified in the small
bilingual corpus analysis; intransitive sentences are
used 42.8% in Japanese, while 23.4% in the
English translations (Nariyama 2003a).
Moreover, the principle of ellipsis specifies that
the higher an argument in terms of animacy and
discourse salience, the more prone it will be to
ellipsis. Indeed, when a higher argument is
ellipted, as in &apos;There was a call (for me) from my
husband&apos;, the sentence sounds natural. On the
other hand, when a lower argument is ellipted
while a higher is retained, as in &apos;There was a call
for me (from my husband)&apos;, the sentence is
unnatural in Japanese, sounding as if there should
have been an argument specified. Thus, the overt
argument works as a reference to resolve ellipsis.

4.1 Algorithm
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99992285">
This paper adopts one simple linguistically
oriented method and algorithm for ellipsis
resolution demonstrated in Nariyama (2003b),
which is said to resolve the bulk of nominal
ellipsis. For simplicity given the scope of this
paper, only the part of the algorithm pertinent to
the topic addressed in this paper is presented.
Owing to lack of corpus that are tagged with
ellipses including incognito ellipses, this paper
presents the method and reports the results of a
hand-tested newspaper articles and magazine
articles reported in Nariyama (2003a).
Because language use and its mechanism are not
only formidably complicated but also vagarious,
once the lists of verbals and argument taking
nominals that involve incognito ellipsis have been
created, the proposed method will then be auto-
tested, and combined with a learning and stochastic
model, such as the tournament model by Iida et al.
(2003) for improving performance.
The core of the algorithm is captured in the use
of &amp;quot;salient referent list&amp;quot;. This is like a memory
bank that pools old referents from the previous
sentences, attempting to reflect how humans may
store referential information, and hence it builds
context and inference. It is this input information
that provides cues to resolve various types of
ellipsis, including subject ellipsis, non-subject
ellipsis and multiple ellipses (more than one
ellipsis per clause) for inter as well as intra-
sentencial ellipsis. This paper extends its
application to resolving incognito ellipsis.
Salient referent list details all overt arguments in
the sentence, merged with the arguments that have
appeared up until the sentence in question. These
arguments are listed following &amp;quot;salient referent
order list&amp;quot;, which accords TopSB (topicalised
subject) the highest saliency. NomOB (nominative
object) is included in the list, in order to account
for those constructions with an incognito agent.

4.2 Resolving ellipsis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999599166666667">
This subsection explains the way in which
salient referent lists (SRL) are created and used to
resolve ellipses using fragments of a newspaper
article. Each clause is indicated by square brackets
I 1 with the clause number on the right side. The
matrix clause is numbered but not bracketed.
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.95872625">
Is11 has two overt arguments —Mr K (TopSB)
and Mr S (Other). By following the salient referent
order list, TopSB is listed higher than Other. Each
listed argument is given a number. The argument
under Ti has the highest saliency and is therefore
the best candidate as referent for the ellipsis; T2 is
the next highest, and so forth. These arguments are
listed in SRL accordingly, provided with detailed
lexical information, including the grammatical
relation, topicality, animacy (and semantic
attributes using Goi-taikei, the detail of which is
not shown below). Accordingly, the SRL for Is11 is
formulated:
SRL Isll IT I a: Mr K (TopSB; 3rd person) &gt;
T2E: Mr S (Other; 3rd person)}
Ellipsis is resolved based on the information
contained in the SRL for the whole sentence,
instead of a clause, where the ellipsis appears. [Si]
contains no ellipsis, so we process the next
sentence Is21.
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.950076111111111">
2 The salient referent list and its order were
eclectically adapted from variety of sources, including
the Japanese version of Expected Center Order in
Centeing Theory (Kameyama, 1985), and Givon&apos;s
Topicality hierarchy (1979). The idea was in turn rooted
in the hierarchy proposed by Keenan and Comrie
(1977). This paper&apos;s use of such a linguistically
fundamental hierarchy made some resemblance to other
approaches, for example, Lappin and Leass (1994).

`(Hea) appeared cautious by saying that (hea)
didn&apos;t understand (hisb) real intention.&apos;
SRL is updated with each new sentence. }s21 has
two overt arguments: shin &apos;i (NomOB (+1), which is
detected from the semantics of NomOB and the
verb wakaru &apos;understand&apos; that requires an agent of
&apos;understand&apos;, and noted as (+1) for having single
ellipsis, not double) and shisei (OB). These are
incorporated into the SRL [01 to make SRL }s21
by following the salient referent order list.
SRL }s21 IT la: Mr K (TopSB; 3rd person) &gt;
T2c: shin &apos;i (Nom0B(+1); inanimate) &gt;
T3d: shisei (0B; inanimate) &gt;
T4b: Mr S (Other; 3rd person)}
The semantics and the structure of the clauses
signal that Is21 has three ellipses: the subject and
the possessive in Clause 1 and the subject in
Clause 2. Ellipsis is resolved per clause. So the Ti
argument is applied as referent to each clause.
Clause 1 contains two ellipses, which are also
ordered following the salient referent order list. As
the subject is higher than the possessive (Other),
Ti is applied to the subject and T2, the next
highest, is applied to the other ellipsis. However,
T2 is incompatible because the possessor cannot be
the same as the possessed. So T3, the next down, is
examined. The semantics of T3 is incompatible
with those selected by the head noun shin &apos;i. So T4,
the next down, is chosen. This interpretation,
following the method, selects the correct referents
for ellipses including incognito ellipsis.
This operation reflects the mechanisms pr esent-
ed in §3.2.2 that the argument high in animacy and
discourse salience is expressed as the subject
(which is listed high in SRL) and most prone to
ellipsis (i.e. taking the highest argument in SRL as
referent).

[s31 contains two overt arguments: Mr S (SB)
and renraku &apos;contact&apos; (NomOB), which replaces
the NomOB in SRL }s21 for the reasons of recency,
as the current system lists only one argument under
any one grammatical relation. Note that Mr S is
listed as SB, because, as shown in Figure 3, Z in
&apos;from Z&apos; of Nom0B(+2) is in essense the subject.
Accordingly, SRL Is31 is created as follows:
SRL Is31 IT la: Mr K (TopSB; 3rd person) &gt;
T2b; Mr S (SB, 3rd person)
T3e: renraku (NomOB(-2); inanimate)&gt;
T4d: shisei (0B; inanimate)}
As the semantics of the NomOB &apos;contact&apos; select
two arguments (source and goal), Is31 involves
double incognito ellipses, noted as `Nom0B(+2)&apos;
in the SRL. So }s31 is missing a goal argument.
The Ti argument is chosen as the referent, which
provides the correct interpretation.

4.4 Other studies on ellipsis resolution
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999968810810811">
Since the phenomenon of incognito ellipsis has
not been raised in the study ellipsis resolution, the
algorithm presented in §4.2 can be fully compared
with no methods. So the overall method is
compared here with that of Centering theory by
Walker et al. (1994), as Centering theory is a
widely adopted theory and also has a focus-based
approach.
Centering theory seems to be in essence a
theory that explains the interpretation of an
anaphor for having a particular referent as its
antecedent. It is also used to predict a perferred
reading based on four transitional states: Continue,
Retain, Smooth-shift, and Rough-shift. With the
assumption that sentences maintain discourse
coherence, the theory selects a preferred reading
that has the least shift (i.e. Continue) of topic
(attentional state) to be the correct reading, and
introduced a constraint &apos;Zero topic assingment&apos; to
maintain Continue. This claim was substanciated
in the same paper using constructed sentences.
However, Iida (1998), one of the authors of Walker
et al. (1994), examined newspaper articles and
found that a shift of topic is abundant even with the
use of zero (ellipsis) (60/136 shifted). Thus the
result refutes the claim of Walker et al. (1994).
Other shortcomings as I see in Centering theory
for the application of ellipsis resolution include
lack of clarity and adequacy in handling complex
sentences and multiple ellipses. The method to
retain one and only one Cb from the immediately
preceding sentence is also problematic, which is
also problematic for the proposed method of this
paper. The solution to this problem requires
inclusion of global topic and some contraints that
regulate a switch of interpretation from local topic
to global, as well as the recognition of exophora.

5 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999968066666667">
This paper raised the need for resolving a
neglected type of nominal ellipsis, &apos;incognito&apos;
ellipsis, whose constructions are apparently
syntactically saturated but which nevertheless
require resolution for full interpretation.
Lists of verbals and nominals that subcategoirse
for one or two incognito ellipses are being created.
These lists will lessen the difficulty of capturing
incognito ellipsis differentiating from optional
deletion (in proto-typical intransitive sentences) for
surface-structurally identical sentences for machine
processing. Given the complexity and vagary of
human language, the proposed method will be
combined with a learning/stochastic model and be
tested it in large corpus.

<abstract confidence="0.975287842105263">There is a type of nominal ellipsis that has been neglected in the study of ellipsis resolution. Certain sentence constructions, observed in diverse languages, tend to disguise the existence of ellipsis due to an anomalous case assignment that assigns the nominative case to what is not typically the subject. This phenomenon deserves attention, for the referent of such an ellipsis is the agent of the sentence that carries vital information for Question Answering. Furthermore, as many languages including English do not use these constructions, resolution of such ellipses is of importance for Machine Translation and other multilingual applications. This paper presents a method to detect such disguised ellipses and to resolve them as well as common ellipses in a unified manner</abstract>

English expresses the proposition by the &apos;have&apos; construction, i.e. &apos;I have a sister.&apos; Discourse structure has a bearing on the differences. The existential constructions in English provide background information into a discourse by introducing a new indefinite referent (Insua 2003).

This paper focuses on the phenomenon seen in Japanese. There have been numerous papers on resolving Japanese ellipsis (Nakaiwa et al. 1995; Walker et al. 1994; Kameyama, 1985; inter alia).

This is summarised as follows: I. Intransitive constructions (e.g. 5b) II. Passive constructions (e.g. 6b) III. Constructions with pleonastic pronoun (e.g. 7) IV.

Hence, the recognition and resolution of such ellipses is of importance particularly in multilingual applications including Machine Translation, and in Question Answering and Information Retrieval for capturing the agent. This paper focuses on the phenomenon seen in Japanese. There have been numerous papers on resolving Japanese ellipsis (Nakaiwa et al. 1995; Walker et al. 1994; Kameyama, 1985; inter alia). A book by Mazuka and Nagai (eds.) (1995) collects 14 papers addressing different aspects of Japanese sentences from the point of view of sentence processing. However, the phenomenon of &apos;incognito ellipsis&apos; raised in this paper is not dealt with in those papers. 2.1 Agent disguising constructions Some constructions disguise an agent even in English. This is summarised as follows: I. Intransitive constructions (e.g. 5b) II. Passive constructions (e.g. 6b) III. Constructions with pleonastic pronoun (e.g. 7) IV. Existential constructions (e.g. 1,3,8,9) V. Nominative object constructions (e.g. 2,4) The following pairs of sentences show t</context>

Finally, Section 4 presents a method for resolving incognito ellipses as well as common ellipses in a unified manner. 2 Incognito ellipsis The constructions that contain &apos;incognito&apos; ellipsis are observed in diverse languages, such as Spanish, Russian, Latin, Japanese, Turkish, and Old English (Shibatani, 1982:106). The following examples from Japanese newspaper articles demonstrate the point.&apos; Both (1) and (2) appear syntactically complete, containing all subcategorised arguments, including, and most importantly, the subject of the sentence. However, semantically there is a missing agent. Indeed, in languages, such as English, an overt expression of the agent is required, as demonstrated by the fact that the literal translation of these sentences produces peculiar English sentences. The natural English translation (shown by the arrows —&gt;) requires a specification of the agent that is not expressed</context>
