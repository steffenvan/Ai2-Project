ABSTRACT

<bodyText confidence="0.9992869375">
A recognition grammar to supply information to a text-to-speech system for the synthesis of
Italian must rely heavily upon lexical information, in order to instantiate the appropriate
grammatical relations.
Italian is an almost free word order language which nonetheless adopts fairly analysable stra-
tegies to move major constituents: some of these can strongly affect the functioning of the pho-
nological component. Two basic claims will be made: i. difficulties in associating grammatical
functions to constituent structure can be overcome only if Lexical Theory is adopted as a general
theoretical framework, and translated into adequate computational formalisms like ATN or CHART;
ii. decisions made at previous point affect focus structure construal rules, which are higher
level phonological rules which individuate intonation centre, build up adequate Intonational
Groups and assign pauses to adequate sites, all being very sensitive to syntactic and semantic
information.
We will concentrate on Subject/Object function association to c-structure in Italian, and its
relation to ATN formalism, in particular HOLD mechanism and FLAGging. Then we will show how syn-
tactic decisions interact with an intonation grammar. We shall also introduce two functional no-
tions: STRUCTURE REVERSIBILITY vs. FUNCTIONAL REVERSIBILITY in Italian.

1. INTRODUCTION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999940941176471">
In a recent paper we presented (Delmonte, 1983)
a phonological processor for Italian which has
been implemented at the University of Venice and is
used in a text-to-speech system (Delmonte et al.,
1984) for the synthesis of Italian at the Centre of
Computational Sonology of the University of Padua.
Recently the system has been equipped with a lexi-
con and a morphological analyser (Delmonte et al.,
1985) while the parser is on its way to be built,
which, since we adopt Lexical-Functional Grammar
(LFG) (Bresnan, 1982), as background linguistic
theory, should take the form of a chart, much in
the vein of Kay&apos;s (1977,1979,1980) and Kaplan&apos;s
(1973) functional and general syntactic parsers.
At present we are working at the context-free gram-
mar and the semantic information to be associated
with each lexical entry. As it appears, Italian is
a much more complex language to be analysed when
compared with English, German and French. As we
shall discuss in the paper, difficulties arise
basically because Italian has a relatively much
higher freedom in the order of constituents than
the above mentioned languages. Also, the phenomenon
of the unexpressed Subject or Null Subject, makes
the working of a parser a much harder task. In this
sense, a chart being unbiased as to what procedure
to adopt in the course of the analysis, will allow
the parser to benefit both from tcp-down and bottom-
up procedures in an efficient way (plus the obvious
back-up and parallel processing operations usually
required). Besides, both semantic and grammatical
features need to be present throughout the parsing
process, and they will be used to guide the overall
parsing strategy.

2. PASSIVE STRUCTURES AND REVERSIBILITY
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999211722222222">
Assuming that the ultimate goal of a parser is
that of accomplishing the analysis of the input text
in terms cf underlying grammatical relations, we are
usually fronted with the task of assigning thematic
roles to functional representations mapped onto con-
stituent structures, as well as defining other non
trivial semantic relations including ellipsis, pre-
dication, coordination, quantifier/negation and mo-
dality scope, head to modifier/complement/adjunct
relations. All these aspects are relevant to a con-
structional rule of focus structure which addresses
directly the informational structure of the text.
The intermediate level of grammatical function
assignment is in this perspective a relevant level
of representation in that it allows the mapping
from c-structure to 0-roles: in this sense, it con-
tributes to speed up the recognition procedure.
In English, a completely reversible structure is

the following:
1. The secretary has been killed by the director.
in which, either NP arguments of the predicate KILL
can assume the grammatical functions of SUBJect or
OBJect of the sentence. On the contrary, in non-re-
versible passive structures like,
2. The book has been read by John.
only an animate NP argument can be interpreted as
SUBJect of the predicate READ; thus, inanimate NP ar-
guments can only be interpreted as OBJect of the sen-
tence.
It is clear that non-reversible passive structures
contain additional grammatical cues to speed up com-
prehension. but these cues are only available from
lexical entries in which selectional restrictions are
listed. Semantic features are thus called into ques-
tion, and are used to constrain 0-role assignment in
recognition grammars, in order to derive from function-
al structure adequate mapping for focus structure.
In a more strictly computational perspective, verb
morphology is accessed first for Agreement tests; when
passive morphology is detected, this local cue is suf-
ficient to reverse grammatical function assignment
carried out so far to the previously analysed NP SUB-
ject, and assign it Object function. Also transitivi-
ty test is necessary not to get entangled with intran-
sitive verbs taking Auxiliary BE.
If we regard constituent discontinuities as the
major issue to be addressed in the grammatical per-
spective so far outlined, passive structures are the
canonical case of NP movement in Transformational
Grammar (TG), in which traces or gaps are left be-
hind by displaced constituents; or within LFG theory
of control, the coindexing performed on f-structures
between metavariables and empty nodes. In a strict-
ly configurational language like English there does
not seem to be such a strong motivation for adopting
LFG theoretical framework and introducing the inter-
mediate representation in terms of f-structures. It
might as well be sufficient to inspect precedence and
dominance relations as instantiated by constituent
structure and relate them to PSR of a context-free
grammar in which canonical constituent order is en-
coded. Since in tensed clauses either a lexical or a
pronominal SUBJect must be expressed in preverbal po
sition - or else a dummy pronoun like &amp;quot;there, it&amp;quot; -
it could be possible to label NP1, or the one domin-
ated directly by S. as SUBJect, whereas postverbal
NP2 if present, as OBJect of the clause, or the one
dominated directly by VP.
Unfortunately, what applies to English or other
fixed word order languages, does not apply to ro-
mance languages and in particular to Italian or Spa-
nish, which have been called Null Subject Languages
(NSL). One of the distinguishing properties of NSL
is that they do not have a canonical position for NP
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.97105675">
Subject: it can either appear in preverbal position
as in English, or
i. in postverbal position as a case of Subject In-
version;
ii. be unexpressed as a case of obviative or extra-
sentential pronominal, in tensed clauses;
iii. .be stranded or extraposed, usually in tensed
clauses: NP Subject has been moved out of its
matrix clause and placed after an embedded clause,
which it controls (Subject must be unexpressed).,
or not - no intervening lexical NP Subjects are
allowed, however.

<bodyText confidence="0.9930532">
Before going into the analysis of Italian with
more detail, it is worth while noticing that not al-
ways NPI entertains Subject function, nor NP2 can be
interpreted as Object of a finite clause in English,
as the following examples show:

<listItem confidence="0.998461857142857">
3. Computers have been given no consideration what-
soever by linguistis in Italy.
4. Her father Mary hates.

6. The logical operator .NOT. applies to the paren-
thesized statement.
7. Geneva is easy to reach from Italy.

<bodyText confidence="0.999058285714286">
in which we have cases of fronted NP2 detectable on-
ly by having access to NPs inherent semantic features.
Thus, in 3, it is OBJect2 which has been passivized
and not NP2; in 4. we have a topical ized sentence
with fronted NP2; in 5. SELL is used in ergative
structural configuration, in which NP2 is raised to
Subject; the same applies to 6, a case in which Sub-
ject NP would be always omitted (subjectless imper-
sonal structures are frequently used in technical
and scientific English); also 7. is a subjectless
structure, in which &amp;quot;tough predicate&amp;quot; appears and
Object NP2 is raised to Subject position. And now
briefly, NP2 need not always be interpreted as Object
of its clause, as shown below:

9. But the real murderer is the landlord.

sition; 9. is a predication sentence in which some-

verbal NP is OBJect2 of ditransitive Verbs construc-

3. NH- CLAUSES AND FUNCTIONAL REVERSIBILITY
</sectionHeader>
<footnote confidence="0.93217175">
In Italian, reversible structures are also pre-
sent sometimes obligatorily, always optionally, in
wh- clauses. Let us quote first the following example,
11. This is the lion that ate the man that ate the
</footnote>
<page confidence="0.997032">
137
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.996733392156863">
11. rabbit that ate the carrot.
Each embedded clause can only be interpreted as con-
taining an NP argument of EAT assuming Subject func-
tion when in preverbal position and Object function
when in postverbal position, the complementizer
&amp;quot;that&amp;quot; relativizing only the left-adjacent MP and in-
terpreted as Subject of the following clause. No
such interpretation is allowed in 12.
12. This is the man (that) the lion ate.
in which the intervening NP &amp;quot;the lion&amp;quot; prevents the
complementizer from occupying strictly preverbal po-
sition, thus being assigned Object function and as
such it is possibile to omit it; Subject function
being thus assumed by &amp;quot;the lion&amp;quot;. But in Italian al-
so 13. would have to be allowed,
13. *This is the carrot that ate the rabbit that ate
the man that ate the lion. (Questa 4 la carota
che mangio ii coniglio che mangiO l&apos;uomo che man
gib il leone).
This sentence is absolutely symmetrical semantically
to 11., except for the fact that 13. predicates some
thing about &amp;quot;a carrot&amp;quot; - the head - whereas 11. pre-
dicates the same concept though with a different in-
formational structure, focus on the &amp;quot;lion&amp;quot;. Conceptu
ally an operation recalling the passive.
Let us now reformulate the two notions that we
have introduced so far, structural reversibility vs.
functional reversibility and repeat example 1,
1. The secretary has been killed by the director.
where what we want to stipulate is the possibility
to interchange Subject/Object function between the
two arguments of the predicate KILL; thus, we could
also have,
1.i The director has been killed by the secretary.
besides the active forms,
1.ii The director has killed the secretary.
1.iii The secretary has killed the director.
Structural reversibility involves basically the pos-
sibility to use the same constituent order and to
freely alternate the instantiation of grammatical
functions, while the underlying grammatical rela-
tions intervening between the arguments of the pre-
dicate, change. What is implied is that: although
both NP arguments of the predicate are eligible to
be interpreted as Subject or Object, only one inter-
pretation will result in each case a grammatically
valid configuration results. Thus, even though the-
matic roles can be attached interchangeably to ei-
ther preverbal or postverbal NPs without violating
selectional restrictions or semantic compatibility
conditions, it is the final constituent order and
structure that decides on the final interpretation.
positions in phrase structure tree and functional
structure positions. Other cues will help producing
the final interpretation besides structural syntactic
ones: since either NP1 or NP2 in (surface) c-structure
won&apos;t match their selectional restrictions with the
requirements of functional structure mapping, the
parser will compute directly one or the other inter-
pretation disambiguating the resulting sentences on
the basis of conditions ,and tests on the arcs, rather
than on its context-free grammar. Thus in 2.
2. The book has been read by John.
we are not allowed to build,
2.i* John has been read by the book.
2.ii* The book has read John (OK in Italian)
but only,
2.iii John has read the book.
without violating selectional restrictions. Going
back to our previous examples, 11. and 13., what we
have then is an example of non-reversible functional
structures. In this case, both preverbal and post-
verbal positions in constituent structure could be
freely accessed by the two arguments of the predicate
EAT as was the case with example 1, and contrary to
what happened with example 2.:
A. what is blocked in structural reversibility - as
non reversible passives show - is the availabi-
lity of one of the structural constituent posi-
tions to be accessed by both arguments of the
predicate;
B. in functional reversibility - as non reversible
wh- clauses show - it is the availability of one
of the arguments of the predicate to be assigned
any grammatical function, that is blocked.
In B. constituent order is irrelevant, and it is cru-
cial in A.; B. is typical of NSL, while A. is typical
of configurational languages in which grammatical
functions can be associated in a reliable way to
fixed or canonical constituent orders. In Italian,
no such canonical order exist, essentially because
both preverbal and postverbal constituent positions
constitute an unmarked case for Subject/Object func-
tional assignment.
The consequences of this analysis of italian in
terms of functional reversibility will be explored
when analysing functional reversible structures.
For now it suffices to remark that a parser is unable
to rely on constituent order alone to produce reason-
able predictions on the underlying grammatical rela-
tions: it will be obliged to make available semantic
information in all cases of tensed active clauses.

able to the parser by looking up lexical subcategori-
zation frames and phrase structure so far computed
- roughly the Agenda and the Chart. In the case of
wh- questions, do-supportwill trigger Object function
assignment to the fronted wh- word/phrase; besides,
also wh- questions without do-support or subject
auxiliary inversion are allowed, only when the ques-
tion element is the Subject. In the remaining embed-
ded structures, an intervening NP in preverbal posi-
tion will trigger Object function for the wh- word/
phrase. Let us look at some examples,
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.894807">
14. Dove (VP e ha sepolto (PN.il tesoro (S&apos; che e
object
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99724735483871">
ha rubato e)))(nbi;Rmo (S&apos; di cui e parlavi e))
where we only marked major constituents and empty
positions in f-structure. This example translates
literally example n.120 from Ritchie, 1980:
14.i Where did (hpealeWo you mentioned e) bury
(hpeAmiure (which he stole !..9)?
In Italian we always have this elaborate structure
when heavy NPs are involved in wh- questions. If we
coindex NPs with empty nodes we get,
g.iiDoveMe.ha sepolto(NP. il tesoro(S&apos; che e.
j
harubatoe.)))(NP.Puomo(S&apos; di cui ek par-
Lavi e.))?
where NP Subject l&apos;uomo&amp;quot; has been displaced beyond
two bounding nodes - in Italian NP and S&apos; count as
such (see Rizzi, 1980) - and also binds the empty
NP Object position of the lower relative clause,
whereas the null subject position in front of &amp;quot;par-
lavi&amp;quot; is assigned obviative or disjoint reference,to
an extrasentential antecedent. Example 14 is a re-
plica of the simple structure of a yes/no questions:
15. Ha finito i compiti tua sorella?
(Has your sister finished her homework)
where postverbal position is again reserved for NP
Object and the NP Subject &amp;quot;tua sorella&amp;quot; has been
stranded or &amp;quot;extraposed&amp;quot;. In wh- questions, the pro-
blem with Italian syntactic structure is due to the
absence of a clear surface indicator for grammatical
function assignment, even though, as a rule, it is
the Object NP that is questioned, as in 14.15. But
the following examples do not follow this rule:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.723567">
16. Quale pesce ha pescato la segretaria?
17. Quale segretaria ha pescato il pesce?
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.964923833333333">
which can be translated respectively as,
16.1 Which fish did the secretary catch?
17.i Which secretary caught the fish?
where the underlying grammatical functions can easi-
ly be recovered due to the presence of do-support in
16.1 - thus inducing Object function on the ques-
tioned element, and the lack of do-support in 17.i
thus inducing Subject function assignment on the wh-
phrase.
Unfortunately in Italian 16. and 17. contain no struc-
tural cues indicating that what is being questioned
is either a Subject or Object, in other words these
structures are fully functionally reversible. Gramma-
tical functions are assigned when selectional restric-
tions for the predicate CATCH are accessed and seman-
tic inherent features of the arguments are detected
and compared. Further difficulties arise with embedded
structures in wh- questions, as shown below:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.981195857142857">
18. Chi era la persona che Gino ha incontrato e ieri?
19. Chi era la persona che e ha incontrato e Gino?
20. Chi e ha detto che e avrebbe assunto e 11 capo?

21.i What did he/she say that John would have bought

ii What did John say that he would have bought at
the market?
22.i Who did Mario intend to upset?
ii Who intended to upset Mario?
23.i Which secretary knew the director?
ii Which secretary did the director know?
We only marked structural gaps at functional level
with the underlined e; here the first difficulty is
constituted by the ambiguity naturally associated to
all these structures, with the exception of 18. In
this case, no ambiguity arises because we have a pre-
dicative structure followed by a restrictive relat-
ive in which Subject preverbal position is appro-
priately filled by the proper noun Gino/John. How-
ever, in 19, another interpretation is available:
&amp;quot;la persona&amp;quot; is the head NP of the following relat-
ive and controls the empty subject position of the
Verb INCONTRARE, while &amp;quot;Gino&amp;quot; is Object NP. This in-
terpretation, though, is not the only one available
in 19, since in Italian, Gino might as well have
been extracted from Subject position via Subject
Inversion - or rather, it might occupy postverbal
position, another canonical position for Subject
function in Italian.
In 20. then, three gaps are available, consequent
ly three alternative interpretations as follows,
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.951129333333333">

tion controlled by &amp;quot;chi&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;ii capon controlling
the lower Verb; in b. &amp;quot;chi&amp;quot; is the Subject of the
nigher clause and &amp;quot;il capo&amp;quot; the Object of the lower
one; in c. &amp;quot;il capo&amp;quot; is the Subject of both the
higher and lower clause, and &amp;quot;chi&amp;quot; is made to fill
Object position of the lower verb. For 21, the fol-
lowing two alternative structures, though, are only
available:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.905284">
a. Che cosa (x) ha detto che Gino avrebbe acquistato
al mercato.
b. Che cosa ha detto Gino che avrebbe acquistato al
mercato.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.993180478260869">
no other structure is available since &amp;quot;che cosa&amp;quot; is
usually extracted from Object postverbal position,
and Italian does not allow double filled Object po-
sitions. In b. Gino controls both empty subject po-
sition in the higher and lower Verbs, and the Object
postverbal position is reserved for the wh- word: so,
only a. can alternatively be generated.
These interpretations are generated also because
the predicate-argument structures of the Verbs allow
it: INCONTRARE is an only transitive verb, while
ASSUMERE can be intransitivized, and ACQUISTARE is
again an only transitive verb. Transitive verbs re-
quire an Object NP while intransitivizable ones
don&apos;t. With intransitive verbs only one interpre-
tation would be allowed as in:
24. Chi ha detto che sta arrivando Gino?
(Who said that John was arriving?)
where ARRIVARE does not allow an Object NP, thus
&amp;quot;Gino&amp;quot; must be analysed as Subject; besides, also
&amp;quot;chi&amp;quot; could not possibly be analysed as Object NP
of ARRIVARE, so it is made to occupy Subject posi-
tion of the higher clause and inserted in the empty
slot adjacent to the wh-word.

5. HOLD MECHANISM AND WH- CLAUSES
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999812315789474">
It appears thus, that a minimal requirement for
producing adequate parses for these complex wh-
clauses is access to predicate-argument structure
in the Lexical Form - roughly subcategorization
frames - of Verbs. These would be entered in the
Agenda as expectations to be fulfilled by the par-
ser. It is also clear that we would like to have a
rule for functional control induced structurally,
by means of which, empty Subject positions in tensed
embedded clauses and in matrix clauses would be
bound by lexically filled adjacent Subject position
(corresponding to c-command dominion in terms of
syntactic binding - See Zaenen, 1983).
The problem now is the following: how do we get
extraposed/stranded NP Subject or Object to climb
up to fill the appropriate gaps?
In ATN formalism, a question element register
HOLD, is used to contain the questioned element
which is stored temporarily until the rest of the
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.966644">

<bodyText confidence="0.92799652631579">
clause is processed. In wh- clauses the element is
then passed down to any constituent that might use
it or that in turn could pass it down to one of its
constituents. If we follow Winograd&apos;s suggestion, we
might: &amp;quot;put the Held item into a special role regis-
ter associated with every type of constituent that
uses it&amp;quot;(1983, 233).
In particular, &amp;quot;chi&amp;quot; in examples 19.20.24. could
be associated with NP constituents/empty NP nodes in
f-structure. Since it could be made to fill either
Subject or Object positions. When transitivity and
agreement have been checked, and the Verb of the lower
clause has been parsed we will be left with the fol-
lowing parallel structures, schematically represen-
ted:
i. chi e / ha detto / che pro / avrebbe assunto e /
ii. chi e/ ha detto / che chi / avrebbe assunto e /
e pro/ ha detto/ che pro / avrebbe assunto
COMP NP / VP /COMP NP / VP NP /
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.892878" genericHeader="method">
SUBJECT SUBJECT OBJECT
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.982748428571428">
when the lexical NP &amp;quot;il capo&amp;quot; il reached, it must be
made to climb up into the empty registers (e) or pro
the obviative extrasentential pronominal, of the al-
ready parsed phrase structure. Since ATN grammars are
usually made for top-down processing strategies, and
this example would clearly constitute a case of bot-
tom-up data-driven processing strategy it would seem
that a CHART could perform better, being unbiased as
to what strategy to follow. Anyhow, this is the
structural representations that we would like to get:
iv. chi / ha detto/che/il capo/avrebbe assunto e/
v. chi / ha detto/che chi/avrebbe assunto ii capo/
vi. chi il capo/ ha detto/che/il capo/avrebbe assunto
e/
where the empty node in iv. represents the extraction
site of the wh- word; in v. chi is Subject in both
clauses; and in vi. il capo is Subject of both clauses
and chi is extracted from e. We must remember that
the lexical NP &amp;quot;il capo&amp;quot; might as well be lacking,
without affecting the grammaticality of these inter-
pretations: in this case i.ii.iii. would have to be
preserved and accounted for on a discourse level,
i.e. antecedents of empty nodes/pro positions be re-
covered from text or discourse.
If we look in more detail into the HOLD mecha-
nism, we can easily see that it embodies a partic-
ular linguistic phenomenon: i. it individuates wh-
words or phrases displaced leftward from their ori-
ginal locations, and stores them temporarily in a
register; ii. it inspects forward its right con-
text in search of a hole in constituent structure,
using lexical information; iii. the hole must have
the same constituent label of the stored item, and
must be in a lower network, where the contents of
the Hold register will have to be passed down. A
copy of the NP (carrying SUBJect or OBJect function) &amp;quot;by&amp;quot; is parsed, it is taken as the phrase specifying
or PP (carrying INDirect OBJect, ADJunct - of time, the agent; thus the dummy subject NP will be set to
location and direction ) constituent parsed will be the (by) NP, now the deep subject, or stay empty if

the fact that no NP is available at the start.
If we look into passive NP function assignment
mechanism, we can see that what triggers the pro-
cedure is verb morphology: once passive voice is de-
tected in the main verb, DIRect OBJect is set to
SUBJect, which must have been already properly
parsed (see Winograd, 217). This setting procedure
is like an assignment statement in a programming
procedure: the first NP encountered by the parser is
assigned SUBJect function at first; when the verb
is met, its label is changed to that of DIRect OBJ-
ect. Subject is subsequently set to a dummy NP,which
as Winograd comments, is used to indicate an NP node
with no register contents, constructed to represent
un unknown subject. When the PP with preposition

what in English is achieved by means of syntactic
structure, in Italian is achieved via focus struc-

at the end of which a pause may be produced. The
phonological focus or intonational centre must be
included in focus structure on one of its consti-
tuent, usually the last on the right. According to
the constituents, in condition of adjacency, focus

as semantically deviant, whereas both 29.i/ii are

In other words, if no information is available
as to the grammatical functions being entertained by
the NPs argument of the predicate, the opposite
meaning may well be instantiated, and this will af-
fect the phonological representation which in turn
will affect the phonetic realization of the sen-
tence. This information will necessarily have to be
derived from the lexical form associated with the
predicate, and eventually be adequately coupled with
annotated PSRs as represented within the framework
of LFG.
Thus we propose to couple PSRs with phonological
marking of focus when relevant: this representation
will interact with lexical representations and lexi
cal redundancy rules to filter out c-structures and
produce the appropriate f-structures. Semantic focus
is also annotated when non-ambiguous structures re-
sult. For instance no phonological marking is in-
dicated in wh- questions since as we already no-
ticed, when the questioned element is in narrow FS
it will have to be analysed as SUBJect, whereas in
wider FS as OBJect. Also, TOPIC does not give rise

<abstract confidence="0.98042405882353">A recognition grammar to supply information to a text-to-speech system for the synthesis of Italian must rely heavily upon lexical information, in order to instantiate the appropriate grammatical relations. Italian is an almost free word order language which nonetheless adopts fairly analysable strategies to move major constituents: some of these can strongly affect the functioning of the phonological component. Two basic claims will be made: i. difficulties in associating grammatical functions to constituent structure can be overcome only if Lexical Theory is adopted as a general theoretical framework, and translated into adequate computational formalisms like ATN or CHART; ii. decisions made at previous point affect focus structure construal rules, which are higher level phonological rules which individuate intonation centre, build up adequate Intonational Groups and assign pauses to adequate sites, all being very sensitive to syntactic and semantic information. We will concentrate on Subject/Object function association to c-structure in Italian, and its relation to ATN formalism, in particular HOLD mechanism and FLAGging. Then we will show how syntactic decisions interact with an intonation grammar. We shall also introduce two functional notions: STRUCTURE REVERSIBILITY vs. FUNCTIONAL REVERSIBILITY in Italian.</abstract>
