The reader learns from this book’s introduction (written by Ali Farghaly) that the
objective of the book is to “equip linguists embarking on NLP assignments.” The
introduction also explains why language engineers are needed and summarizes the
contents of each chapter.
“Domain Analysis and Representation” by Farghaly and Bruce Hedin offers a
good discussion of the importance of domain analysis in natural language processing
(NLP). It provides a helpful background on the notion of sublanguages and correctly
notes that distinctions between the different domains can be blurred, as domains often
overlap. The chapter would have been more convincing if there were further examples
of NLP applications that benefit from narrowing down the domain of their operation.
The chapter also discusses the analysis of domain into topics. Section 2.4.4 covers
statistical approaches to classification, but no references or further reading pointers
are given.
“The Language of the Internet” by Naomi Baron gives an easy-to-read and use-
ful chronological overview of the developments on the Internet. It provides informa-
tion about a number of technologies that are used on the Internet, comments on the
changing styles of natural language use, and briefly overviews Web markup and pro-
gramming languages and the Semantic Web. At the same time, I found this chapter
too general. It would have been useful if the chapter had covered specific new NLP
applications that are relevant to the Internet, such as question answering, and had
covered in greater detail low-quality machine translation for e-mail and chat or text
categorization of Web pages.
“Grammar Writing, Testing and Evaluation” by Miriam Butt and Tracy Holloway
King provides a very good and accessible historical and linguistic account of grammars
and parsing in NLP. It covers deep and shallow parsing and associated techniques as
well as testing and evaluation of grammars and parsers. Morphological analyzers and
part-of-speech taggers are briefly outlined too. A good practical point is the section
on documentation of grammar writing.
“Ontologies” by Natalya Noy is a concise and plainly written introduction to the
topic of ontologies and their development. It clarifies key terms in the ontology devel-
opment jargon and includes an overview of major ontologies, ontology libraries, and
Computational Linguistics Volume 30, Number 3
ontology development tools. All this information would be appreciated by anyone
new to the field wishing to find the basic instruction material on the topic. Unfortu-
nately, the discussion does not explicitly deal with how an ontology can be used in an
NLP task, although ontologies are now frequently employed in a wide variety of tasks
(e.g., information extraction, coreference resolution, word sense disambiguation). The
use of ontologies for machine translation is mentioned but not really explained.
In “Text Mining, Corpus Building and Testing,” Karine Megerdoomian covers
important topics for a linguist embarking on NLP research. I found this chapter quite
informative and useful, especially with regard to the use of corpora in computational
linguistics. However, the problem is that too many topics have been included, and as
a result, many of these topics are not properly covered. To start with, the title of the
chapter is a bit misleading; the only discussion about text mining is Section 6.2.4, in
a rather unusual context: between Section 6.2.3 “Corpus Analysis,” and Section 6.3,
“Tokenization.” This two-page section does not sufficiently cover (or even mention)
the whole variety of problem areas in text mining and practices for addressing them.
Also, some of the important work on text mining is not mentioned, and a reference
to Hearst (1999) at least would have been welcome. My view is that it would have
been better to focus the chapter on corpora and corpus annotation and not to cover
low-level text-processing tasks that could have been described in another chapter; or
the reader could have been referred to textbooks or handbooks such as Manning and
Sch¨utze (2000) or Dale, Moisl, and Somers (2000). On the other hand, the use of XML in
corpus annotation could have been described in greater detail. It is perfectly clear that
not everything can be covered in a limited space, but there is no reference to ELDA
or TRACTOR, even though the issue of languages with fewer resources is discussed.
The “Linguist” list is suggested as a source of information about corpora, but not
the “Corpora” list, which in my view is a better choice. Concordances, collocations,
and frequency lists are discussed, but there is no reference to Wordsmith. Finally,
in Section 6.5.4, GATE is called a ’‘graphic interface tool,” which seems to me an
oversimplification.
“Statistical Natural Language Processing” by Chris Callison-Burch and Miles Os-
borne contains a concise and informative introduction to the topic of machine learning
and statistical approaches to NLP. It presents a good overview of the general proce-
dure for building and testing a statistical model of a linguistic phenomenon. The topics
discussed are a bit unbalanced: while it is quite detailed on basic notions (training vs.
testing, baseline, evaluation measures, etc.), more advanced topics (maximum entropy,
kernel methods, ensemble approaches) are discussed too briefly. In the end, the chap-
ter contains a useful overview of application of statistical methods to various NLP
tasks, in which they are contrasted with rule-based approaches, allowing the reader
to form a clear idea of their strengths and weaknesses.
In “Knowledge Representation for Language Engineering,” Matthew Stone focuses
on “uses of knowledge representation that are more directly practical.” The chapter is
competently written, but I wonder if for linguists it would not have been more appro-
priate to discuss in greater detail traditional forms of linguistic knowledge employed
in NLP systems, such as morphological, lexical, syntactic, semantic, and discourse in-
formation, rather than focusing on real-world and commonsense knowledge, given
that the latter is rarely incorporated in practical NLP systems.
“Speech Recognition and Understanding” by Jan Amtrup is an accessible and
useful introduction. To start with, different scenarios of speech applications are well
illustrated. Then text-to-speech systems and speech synthesis are discussed. Following
the section on speech recognition and continuing into the section on language model-
ing, various statistical approaches and techniques are introduced that might, however,

be too difficult for linguists to understand. Important issues such as prosody, dialogue
systems, speech-to-speech translation, and speech resources are also covered. Given
the range of tasks and applications presented, perhaps it would have been more ac-
curate to title this chapter “Speech Processing.”
The closing chapter, “Language Engineering and the Knowledge Economy,” by
Farghaly, argues that a shift is taking place in the industrialized countries from a
product-based to a knowledge-based economy. Even though the author mentions
that language engineering has a role to play in processing and assimilating massive
amounts of language data, I found the presentation of little relevance to computational
linguistics proper.
In my opinion, the coverage of topics is insufficient for a “handbook of language
engineering.” In addition, I would have expected a more practical orientation. It is
understandable that every volume has space constraints, but practical applications in
which linguists can and do play a role, such as text summarization, term extraction
(and terminology processing in general), machine translation, and computer-assisted
language learning, would have been welcome.
With regard to the editor’s and publisher’s roles, among the good points of the
book is the fact that the reader will benefit from good cross-chapter referencing. An-
other good point is that the paperback version of the book is cheap and affordable
($25). Among the weak points of the book is the fact is that copyediting is far from
perfect; for instance, the style of references is not identical across the chapters, and I
also came across a number of spelling mistakes.
To conclude: the book could be of use to linguists embarking on research or projects
in NLP. At the same time, some of the weaknesses outlined above will limit its overall
benefit.
