Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.977845863636364">
In conversation, speakers have been shown
to entrain, or become more similar to each
other, in various ways. We measure entrain-
ment on eight acoustic features extracted from
the speech of subjects playing a cooperative
computer game and associate the degree of en-
trainment with a number of manually-labeled
social variables acquired using Amazon Me-
chanical Turk, as well as objective measures
of dialogue success. We find that male-female
pairs entrain on all features, while male-male
pairs entrain only on particular acoustic fea-
tures (intensity mean, intensity maximum and
syllables per second). We further determine
that entrainment is more important to the per-
ception of female-male social behavior than it
is for same-gender pairs, and it is more impor-
tant to the smoothness and flow of male-male
dialogue than it is for female-female or mixed-
gender pairs. Finally, we find that entrainment
is more pronounced when intensity or speak-
ing rate is especially high or low.

<bodyText confidence="0.9969022">
Entrainment, also termed alignment, adaptation,
priming or coordination, is the phenomenon of
conversational partners becoming more similar to
each other in what they say, how they say it,
and other behavioral phenomena. Entrainment has
been shown to occur for numerous aspects of spo-
ken language, including speakers’ choice of re-
ferring expressions (Brennan &amp; Clark, 1996); lin-
guistic style (Niederhoffer &amp; Pennebaker, 2002;
Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al., 2011); syntactic

structure (Reitter et al., 2006); speaking rate (Lev-
itan &amp; Hirschberg, 2011); acoustic/prosodic fea-
tures such as fundamental frequency, intensity, voice
quality (Levitan &amp; Hirschberg, 2011); and phonet-
ics (Pardo, 2006).
Entrainment in many of these dimensions has also
been associated with different measures of dialogue
success. For example, Chartrand and Bargh (1999)
demonstrated that mimicry of posture and behavior
led to increased liking between the dialogue par-
ticipants as well as a smoother interaction. They
also found that naturally empathetic individuals ex-
hibited a greater degree of mimicry than did oth-
ers. Nenkova et al. (2008) found that entrainment
on high-frequency words was correlated with nat-
uralness, task success, and coordinated turn-taking
behavior. Natale (1975) showed that an individ-
ual’s social desirability, or “propensity to act in
a social manner,” can predict the degree to which
that individual will match her partner’s vocal inten-
sity. Levitan et al. (2011) showed that entrainment
on backchannel-preceding cues is correlated with
shorter latency between turns, fewer interruptions,
and a higher degree of task success. In a study of
married couples discussing problems in their rela-
tionships, Lee et al. (2010) found that entrainment
measures derived from pitch features were signifi-
cantly higher in positive interactions than in nega-
tive interactions and were predictive of the polarity
of the participants’ attitudes.
These studies have been motivated by theoreti-
cal models such as Giles’ Communication Accom-
modation Theory (Giles &amp; Coupland, 1991), which
proposes that speakers promote social approval or

efficient communication by adapting to their inter-
locutors’ communicative behavior. Another theory
informing the association of entrainment and dia-
logue success is the coordination-rapport hypoth-
esis (Tickle-Degnen &amp; Rosenthal, 1990), which
posits that the degree of liking between conversa-
tional partners should be correlated with the degree
of nonverbal coordination between them.
Motivated by such theoretical proposals and em-
pirical findings, we hypothesized that entrainment
on acoustic/prosodic dimensions such as pitch, in-
tensity, voice quality and speaking rate might also
be correlated with positive aspects of perceived
social behaviors as well as other perceived char-
acteristics of efficient, well-coordinated conversa-
tions. In this paper we describe a series of ex-
periments investigating the relationship between ob-
jective acoustic/prosodic dimensions of entrainment
and manually-annotated perception of a set of so-
cial variables designed to capture important as-
pects of conversational partners’ social behaviors.
Since prior research on other dimensions of entrain-
ment has sometimes observed differences in degree
of entrainment between female-female, male-male
and mixed gender groups (Bilous &amp; Krauss, 1988;
Pardo, 2006; Namy et al., 2002), we also exam-
ined our data for variation by gender pair, consid-
ering female-female, male-male, and female-male
pairs of speakers separately. If previous findings
extend to acoustic/prosodic entrainment, we would
expect female-female pairs to entrain to a greater
degree than male-male pairs and female partners in
mixed gender pairs to entrain more than their male
counterparts. Since prior findings posit that entrain-
ment leads to smoother and more natural conversa-
tions, we would also expect degree of entrainment
to correlate with perception of other characteristics
descriptive of such conversations.
Below we describe the corpus and annotations
used in this study and how our social annotations
were obtained in Sections 2 and 3. We next discuss
our method and results for the prevalence of entrain-
ment among different gender groups (Section 4). In
Sections 5 and 6, we present the results of correlat-
ing acoustic entrainment with social variables and
objective success measures, respectively. Finally, in
Section 7, we explore entrainment in cases of outlier
feature values.

2 The Columbia Games Corpus
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99981528125">
The Columbia Games Corpus (Gravano &amp; Hirsch-
berg, 2011) consists of approximately nine hours
of spontaneous dialogue between pairs of subjects
playing a series of computer games. Six females and
seven males participated in the collection of the cor-
pus; eleven of the subjects returned on a different
day for another session with a new partner.
During the course of each session, a pair of speak-
ers played three Cards games and one Objects game.
The work described here was carried out on the Ob-
jects games. This section of each session took 7m
12s on average. We have a total of 4h 19m of Ob-
jects game speech in the corpus.
For each task in an Objects game, the players
saw identical collections of objects on their screens.
However, one player (the Describer) had an addi-
tional target object positioned among the other ob-
jects, while the other (the Follower) had the same
object at the bottom of her screen. The Describer
was instructed to describe the position of the target
object so that the Follower could place it in exactly
the same location on her screen. Points (up to 100)
were awarded based on how well the Follower’s tar-
get location matched the describers. Each pair of
partners completed 14 such tasks, alternating roles
with each task. The partners were separated by a
curtain to ensure that all communication was oral.
The entire corpus has been orthographically tran-
scribed and words aligned with the speech source. It
has also been ToBI-labeled (Silverman et al., 1992)
for prosodic events, as well as labeled for turn-
taking behaviors.

3 Annotation of Social Variables
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9960132">
In order to study how entrainment in various dimen-
sions correlated with perceived social behaviors of
our subjects, we asked Amazon Mechanical Turk1
annotators to label the 168 Objects games in our cor-
pus for an array of social behaviors perceived for
each of the speakers, which we term here “social
variables.”
Each Human Intelligence Task (HIT) presented to
the AMT workers for annotation consisted of a sin-
gle Objects game task. To be eligible for our HITs,

annotators had to have a 95% success rate on pre-
vious AMT HITs and to be located in the United
States. They also had to complete a survey estab-
lishing that they were native English speakers with
no hearing impairments. The annotators were paid
$0.30 for each HIT they completed. Over half of the
annotators completed fewer than five hits, and only
four completed more than twenty.
The annotators listened to an audio clip of the
task, which was accompanied by an animation that
displayed a blue square or a green circle depending
on which speaker was currently talking. They were
then asked to answer a series of questions about each
speaker: Does Person A/B believe s/he is better than
his/her partner? Make it difficult for his/her partner
to speak? Seem engaged in the game? Seem to dis-
like his/her partner? Is s/he bored with the game?
Directing the conversation? Frustrated with his/her
partner? Encouraging his/her partner? Making
him/herself clear? Planning what s/he is going to
say? Polite? Trying to be liked? Trying to domi-
nate the conversation? They were also asked ques-
tions about the dialogue as a whole: Does it flow
naturally? Are the participants having trouble un-
derstanding each other? Which person do you like
more? Who would you rather have as a partner?
A series of check questions with objectively de-
terminable answers (e.g. “Which speaker is the De-
scriber?”) were included among the target questions
to ensure that the annotators were completing the
task with integrity. HITs for which the annotator
failed to answer the check questions correctly were
disqualified.
Each task was rated by five unique annotators who
answered ”yes” or ”no” to each question, yielding
a score ranging from 0 to 5 for each social vari-
able, representing the number of annotators who an-
swered ”yes.” A fuller description of the annotation
for social variables can be found in (Gravano et al.,
2011).
In this study, we focus our analysis on annotations
of four social variables:

tion?

We correlated annotations of these variables with
an array of acoustic/prosodic features.

4 Acoustic entrainment
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9773375">
We examined entrainment in this study in eight
acoustic/prosodic features:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9999655">
• Intensity mean
• Intensity max
• Pitch mean
• Pitch max
• Jitter
• Shimmer
• Noise-to-harmonics ratio (NHR)
• Syllables per second
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.985902705882353">
Intensity is an acoustic measure correlated with
perceived loudness. Jitter, shimmer, and noise-to-
harmonics ratios are three measures of voice quality.
Jitter describes varying pitch in the voice, which is
perceived as a rough sound. Shimmer describes fluc-
tuation of loudness in the voice. Noise-to-harmonics
ratio is associated with perceived hoarseness. All
features were speaker-normalized using z-scores.
For each task, we define entrainment between
partners on each feature f as
ENTp _ −|speaker1f − speaker2f|
where speaker[1,2]f represents the corresponding
speaker’s mean for that feature over the task.
We say that the corpus shows evidence of en-
trainment on feature f if ENTp, the similarities be-
tween partners, are significantly greater than ENTx,
the similarities between non-partners:

where X is the set of speakers of same gender and
role as the speaker’s partner who are not paired with
the speaker in any session. We restrict the compar-
isons to speakers of the same gender and role as the
speaker’s partner to control for the fact that differ-
ences may simply be due to differences in gender or
role. The results of a series of paired t-tests compar-
ing ENTp and ENTx for each feature are summarized
in Table 1.

<bodyText confidence="0.9999747">
We find that female-female pairs in our corpus
entrain on, in descending order of significance, jitter,
intensity max, intensity mean, syllables per second
and shimmer. They do not entrain on pitch mean
or max or NHR. Male-male pairs show the least
evidence of entrainment, entraining only on inten-
sity mean, intensity max, and syllables per second,
supporting the hypothesis that entrainment is less
prevalent among males. Female-male pairs entrain
on, again in descending order of significance, inten-
sity mean, intensity max, jitter, syllables per second,
pitch mean, NHR, shimmer, and pitch max – in fact,
on every feature we examine, with significance val-
ues in each case of p&lt;0.01.
To look more closely at the entrainment behavior
of males and females in mixed-gender pairs, we de-
fine ENT2p as follows:
where T is the set of the pause-free chunks of speech
that begin a speaker’s turns, and P is the correspond-
ing set of pause-free chunks that end the interlocu-
tor’s preceding turns. Unlike ENTp, this measure is
asymmetric, allowing us to consider each member
of a pair separately.
We compare ENT2p for each feature for males and
females of mixed gender pairs. Contrary to our hy-
pothesis that females in mixed-gender pairs would
entrain more, we found no significant differences
in partner gender. Females in mixed-gender pairs
do not match their interlocutor’s previous turn any
more than do males. This may be due to the fact

</tableCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.999725685714286">
that, as shown in Table 1, the overall differences be-
tween partners in mixed-gender pairs are quite low,
and so neither partner may be doing much turn-by-
turn matching.
However, as we expected, entrainment is least
prevalent among male-male pairs. Although we ex-
pected female-female pairs to exhibit the highest
prevalence of entrainment, they do not show evi-
dence of entrainment on pitch mean, pitch max or
NHR, while female-male pairs entrain on every fea-
ture. In fact, although ENTp for these features is not
significantly smaller between female-female pairs
than between female-male pairs, ENTx, the overall
similarity among non-partners for these features, is
significantly larger between females than between
females and males. The degree of similarity between
female-female partners is therefore attributable to
the overall similarity between females rather than
the effect of entrainment.
All three types of pairs exhibit entrainment on in-
tensity mean, intensity max, and syllables per sec-
ond. We look more closely into the gender-based
differences in entrainment behavior with an ANOVA
with the ratio of ENTp to ENTx as the dependent
variable and gender pair as the independent variable.
Normalizing ENTp by ENTx allows us to compare
the degree of entrainment across gender pairs. Re-
sults are shown in Table 2. Male-male pairs have
lower entrainment than female-female pairs for ev-
ery feature; female-male pairs have higher entrain-
ment than female-female pairs for intensity mean
and max and lower for syllables per second (p &lt;
0.1). These results are consistent with the general
finding that male-male pairs entrain the least and
female-male pairs entrain the most.

5 Entrainment and social behavior
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999981246753247">
We next correlate each of the social variables de-
scribed in Section 3 with ENT, for our eight acous-
tic features. Based on Communication Accommo-
dation Theory, we would expect gives encourage-
ment, a variable representing a desirable social char-
acteristic, to be positively correlated with entrain-
ment. Conversely, conversation awkward should be
negatively correlated with entrainment. We note that
Trying to be liked is negatively correlated with the
like more variable in our data – that is, annotators
were less likely to prefer speakers whom they per-
ceived as trying to be liked. This reflects the in-
tuition that someone overly eager to be liked may
be perceived as annoying and socially inept. How-
ever, similarity-attraction theory states that similar-
ity promotes attraction, and someone might there-
fore entrain in order to obtain his partner’s social
approval. This idea is supported by Natale’s find-
ing that the need for social approval is predictive
of the degree of a speaker’s convergence on inten-
sity (Natale, 1975). We can therefore expect trying
to be liked to positively correlate with entrainment.
Speakers who are perceived as trying to dominate
may be overly entraining to their interlocutors in
what is sometimes called “dependency overaccom-
modation.” Dependency overaccommodation causes
the interlocutor to appear dependent on the speaker
and gives the impression that the speaker is control-
ling the conversation (West &amp; Turner, 2009).
The results of our correlations of social vari-
ables with acoustic/prosodic entrainment are gen-
erally consonant with these intuitions. Although it
is not straightforward to compare correlation coeffi-
cients of groups for which we have varying amounts
of data, for purposes of assessing trends, we will
consider a correlation strong if it is significant at the
p &lt; 0.00001 level, moderate at the p &lt; 0.01 level,
and weak at the p &lt; 0.05 level. The results are sum-
marized in Table 3; we present only the significant
results for space considerations.
For female-female pairs, giving encouragement
is weakly correlated with entrainment on intensity
max and shimmer. Conversation awkward is weakly
correlated with entrainment on jitter. For male-male
pairs, trying to be liked is moderately correlated
with entrainment on intensity mean and weakly cor-
related with entrainment on jitter and NHR. Giv-
ing encouragement is moderately correlated with
entrainment on intensity mean, intensity max, and
NHR. For female-male pairs, trying to be liked
is moderately correlated with entrainment on pitch
mean. Giving encouragement is strongly corre-
lated with entrainment on intensity mean and max
and moderately correlated with entrainment on pitch
mean and shimmer. However, it is negatively cor-
related with entrainment on jitter, although the cor-
relation is weak. Conversation awkward is weakly
correlated with entrainment on jitter.
As we expected, giving encouragement is corre-
lated with entrainment for all three gender groups,
and trying to be liked is correlated with entrainment
for male-male and female-male groups. However,
trying to dominate is not correlated with entrainment
on any feature, and conversation awkward is actu-
ally positively correlated with entrainment on jitter.
Entrainment on jitter is a clear outlier here, with
all of its correlations contrary to our hypotheses. In
addition to being positively correlated with conver-
sation awkward, it is the only feature to be nega-
tively correlated with giving encouragement.
Entrainment is correlated with the most social
variables for female-male pairs; these correlations
are also the strongest. We therefore conclude that
acoustic entrainment is not only most prevalent for
mixed-gender pairs, it is also more important to the
perception of female-male social behavior than it is
for same-gender pairs.

We now examine acoustic/prosodic entrainment in
our corpus according to four objective measures of
dialogue success: the mean latency between turns,
the percentage of turns that are interruptions, the
percentage of turns that are overlaps, and the number
of turns in a task.
High latency between turns can be considered a
sign of an unsuccessful conversation, with poor turn-
taking behavior indicating a possible lack of rapport
and difficulty in communication between the part-

ample of poor turn-taking behavior, may be a symp-

tween partners. We expect these measures to be neg-
atively correlated with entrainment. Conversely, a
high percentage of overlaps may be a symptom of
a well-coordinated conversation that is flowing eas-
ily. In the guidelines for the turn-taking annotation
of the Games Corpus (Gravano, 2009), overlaps are
defined as cases in which Speaker 2 takes the floor,
overlapping with the completion of Speaker 1’s ut-
terance. Overlaps require the successful reading of
turn-taking cues and by definition preclude awkward
pauses. We expect a high percentage of overlaps to
correlate positively with entrainment.
The number of turns in a task can be interpreted
either positively or negatively. A high number is
negative in that it is the sign of an inefficient dia-
logue, one which takes many turn exchanges to ac-
complish the objective. However, it may also be
the sign of easy, flowing dialogue between the part-
ners. In our domain, it may also be a sign of a high-

Male-male pairs show the most correlations be-
tween entrainment and objective measures of dia-
logue success. The latency between turns is neg-
atively correlated with entrainment on all variables
except shimmer and syllables per second; the corre-
lations are moderate for intensity max and NHR and
strong for the rest. The number of turns in a task
is positively correlated with entrainment on every
variable except intensity mean, jitter and shimmer:
strongly for NHR; moderately for intensity mean,
pitch mean, and pitch max; and weakly for syllables
per second.. The percentage of overlaps is moder-
ately correlated with entrainment on intensity mean
and max. The percentage of interruptions is moder-
ately correlated with entrainment on NHR.
For female-male pairs, the number of turns is
moderately correlated with entrainment on intensity
mean and weakly correlated with entrainment on in-
tensity max and shimmer. The percentage of over-
laps is moderately correlated with entrainment on
shimmer.
For the most part, the directions of the correla-
tions we have found are in accordance with our hy-
potheses. Latency is negatively correlated with en-
trainment and overlaps and the number of turns are
positively correlated. A puzzling exception is the
percentage of interruptions, which is positively cor-
related with entrainment on shimmer (for female-
female pairs) and NHR (for male-male pairs).
While the strongest correlations were for mixed-
gender pairs for the social variables, we find that
the strongest correlations for objective variables are
for male-male pairs, which also have the great-
est number of correlations. It therefore seems that
while entrainment is more important to the percep-
tion of social behavior for mixed-gender pairs than
it is for same-gender pairs, it is more important to
the smoothness and flow of dialogue for male-male
pairs than it is for female-female or female-male
pairs.

7 Entrainment in outliers
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998685">
Since acoustic entrainment is generally considered
an unconscious phenomenon, it is interesting to con-
sider tasks in which a particular feature of a person’s
speech is particularly salient. This will occur when a
feature differs significantly from the norm – for ex-
ample, when a person’s voice is unusually loud or
soft. Chartrand and Bargh (1999) suggest that the
psychological mechanism behind the entrainment is
the perception-behavior link, the finding that the act
of observing another’s behavior increases the like-
lihood of the observer’s engaging in that behavior.
Based on this finding, we hypothesize that a part-
ner pair containing one “outlier” speaker will exhibit
more entrainment on the salient feature, since that
feature is more likely to be observed and therefore
imitated.
We consider values in the 10th or 90th percentile
for a feature “outliers.” We can consider ENTx, the
similarity between a speaker and the speakers of her
partner’s role and gender with whom she is never
paired, the “baseline” value for the similarity be-
tween a speaker and her interlocutor when no en-
trainment occurs. ENTp − ENTx, the difference be-
tween the similarity existing between partners and
the baseline similarity, is then a measure of how
much entrainment exists relative to baseline.
We compare ENTp − ENTx for “normal” versus
“outlier” speakers. ENTp should be smaller for out-
lier speakers, since their interlocutors are not likely
to be similarly unusual. However, ENTx should also
be lower for outlier speakers, since by definition they
diverge from the norm, while the normal speakers
by definition represent the norm. It is therefore rea-
sonable to expect ENTp − ENTx to be the same for
outlier speakers and normal speakers.
If ENTp − ENTx is higher for outlier speakers,
that means that ENTp is higher than we expect, and
entrainment is greater relative to baseline for pairs
containing an outlier speaker. If ENTp − ENTx is
lower for outlier speakers, that means that ENTp is

speaker entrain less than do pairs of normal speak-
ers, even allowing for the fact that their usual values
should be further apart to begin with.
The results for t-tests comparing ENT, − ENT
for “normal” versus “outlier” speakers are shown
in Table 5. Outlier pairs have higher relative en-
trainment than do normal pairs for intensity mean
and max, shimmer, and syllables per second. This
means that speakers confronted with an interlocutor
who diverges widely from the norm for those four
features make a larger adjustment to their speech in
order to converge to that interlocutor.
An ANOVA shows that relative entrainment on
intensity max is higher in outlier cases for male-
male pairs than for female-female pairs and even
higher for female-male pairs (F=11.33, p=5.3e-05).
Relative entrainment on NHR in these cases is lower
for male-male pairs than for female-female pairs
and higher for female-male pairs (F=11.41, p=6.5e-
05). Relative entrainment on syllables per second
is lower for male-male pairs and higher for female-
male pairs (F=5.73, p=0.005). These results differ
slightly from the results in Table 2 for differences
in entrainment in the general case among gender
pairs, reinforcing the idea that cases in which fea-
ture values diverge widely from the norm are unique
in terms of entrainment behavior.

8 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999987794871795">
Our study of entrainment on acoustic/prosodic vari-
ables yields new findings about entrainment be-
havior for female-female, male-male, and mixed-
gender dyads, as well as the association of entrain-
ment with perceived social characteristics and ob-
jective measures of dialogue smoothness and effi-
ciency. We find that entrainment is the most preva-
lent for mixed-gender pairs, followed by female-
female pairs, with male-male pairs entraining the
least. Entrainment is the most important to the per-
ception of social behavior of mixed-gender pairs,
and it is the most important to the efficiency and flow
of male-male dialogues.
For the most part, the directions of the correla-
tions of entrainment with success variables accord
with hypotheses motivated by the relevant literature.
Giving encouragement and trying to be liked are
positively correlated with entrainment, as are per-
centage of overlaps and number of turns. Mean la-
tency, a symptom of a poorly-run conversation, is
negatively associated with entrainment. However,
several exceptions suggest that the associations are
not straightforward and further research must be
done to fully understand the relationship between
entrainment, social characteristics and dialogue suc-
cess. In particular, the explanation behind the as-
sociations of entrainment on certain variables with
certain social and objective measures is an interest-
ing direction for future work.
Finally, we find that in “outlier” cases where a
particular speaker diverges widely from the norm for
intensity mean, intensity max, or syllables per sec-
ond, entrainment is more pronounced. This supports
the theory that the perception-behavior link is the
mechanism behind entrainment and provides a pos-
sible direction for research into why speakers entrain
on certain features and not others. In future work we
will explore this direction and go more thoroughly
into individual differences in entrainment behavior.

<abstract confidence="0.998204695652174">In conversation, speakers have been shown to entrain, or become more similar to each other, in various ways. We measure entrainment on eight acoustic features extracted from the speech of subjects playing a cooperative computer game and associate the degree of entrainment with a number of manually-labeled social variables acquired using Amazon Mechanical Turk, as well as objective measures of dialogue success. We find that male-female pairs entrain on all features, while male-male pairs entrain only on particular acoustic features (intensity mean, intensity maximum and syllables per second). We further determine that entrainment is more important to the perception of female-male social behavior than it is for same-gender pairs, and it is more important to the smoothness and flow of male-male dialogue than it is for female-female or mixedgender pairs. Finally, we find that entrainment is more pronounced when intensity or speaking rate is especially high or low.</abstract>

In this paper we describe a series of experiments investigating the relationship between objective acoustic/prosodic dimensions of entrainment and manually-annotated perception of a set of social variables designed to capture important aspects of conversational partners’ social behaviors. Since prior research on other dimensions of entrainment has sometimes observed differences in degree of entrainment between female-female, male-male and mixed gender groups (Bilous &amp; Krauss, 1988; Pardo, 2006; Namy et al., 2002), we also examined our data for variation by gender pair, considering female-female, male-male, and female-male pairs of speakers separately. If previous findings extend to acoustic/prosodic entrainment, we would expect female-female pairs to entrain to a greater degree than male-male pairs and female partners in mixed gender pairs to entrain more than their male counterparts. Since prior findings posit that entrainment leads to smoother and more natural conversations, we would also expect degree of entrainment to correlate with perception of other characterist</context>

We expect these measures to be negatively correlated with entrainment. Conversely, a high percentage of overlaps may be a symptom of a well-coordinated conversation that is flowing easily. In the guidelines for the turn-taking annotation of the Games Corpus (Gravano, 2009), overlaps are defined as cases in which Speaker 2 takes the floor, overlapping with the completion of Speaker 1’s utterance. Overlaps require the successful reading of turn-taking cues and by definition preclude awkward pauses. We expect a high percentage of overlaps to correlate positively with entrainment. The number of turns in a task can be interpreted either positively or negatively. A high number is negative in that it is the sign of an inefficient dialogue, one which takes many turn exchanges to accomplish the objective.

Below we describe the corpus and annotations used in this study and how our social annotations were obtained in Sections 2 and 3. We next discuss our method and results for the prevalence of entrainment among different gender groups (Section 4). In Sections 5 and 6, we present the results of correlating acoustic entrainment with social variables and objective success measures, respectively. Finally, in Section 7, we explore entrainment in cases of outlier feature values. 2 The Columbia Games Corpus The Columbia Games Corpus (Gravano &amp; Hirschberg, 2011) consists of approximately nine hours of spontaneous dialogue between pairs of subjects playing a series of computer games. Six females and seven males participated in the collection of the corpus; eleven of the subjects returned on a different day for another session with a new partner. During the course of each session, a pair of speakers played three Cards games and one Objects game. The work described here was carried out on the Objects games. This section of each session took 7m 12s on average. We have a total of 4h 19m of Objects game speech in the corpus. For each task in an Objects gam</context>

Entrainment has been shown to occur for numerous aspects of spoken language, including speakers’ choice of referring expressions (Brennan &amp; Clark, 1996); linguistic style (Niederhoffer &amp; Pennebaker, 2002; Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al., 2011); syntactic 11 structure (Reitter et al., 2006); speaking rate (Levitan &amp; Hirschberg, 2011); acoustic/prosodic features such as fundamental frequency, intensity, voice quality (Levitan &amp; Hirschberg, 2011); and phonetics (Pardo, 2006). Entrainment in many of these dimensions has also been associated with different measures of dialogue success.

In this paper we describe a series of experiments investigating the relationship between objective acoustic/prosodic dimensions of entrainment and manually-annotated perception of a set of social variables designed to capture important aspects of conversational partners’ social behaviors. Since prior research on other dimensions of entrainment has sometimes observed differences in degree of entrainment between female-female, male-male and mixed gender groups (Bilous &amp; Krauss, 1988; Pardo, 2006; Namy et al., 2002), we also examined our data for variation by gender pair, considering female-female, male-male, and female-male pairs of speakers separately. If previous findings extend to acoustic/prosodic entrainment, we would expect female-female pairs to entrain to a greater degree than male-male pairs and female partners in mixed gender pairs to entrain more than their male counterparts.

This reflects the intuition that someone overly eager to be liked may be perceived as annoying and socially inept. However, similarity-attraction theory states that similarity promotes attraction, and someone might therefore entrain in order to obtain his partner’s social approval. This idea is supported by Natale’s finding that the need for social approval is predictive of the degree of a speaker’s convergence on intensity (Natale, 1975). We can therefore expect trying to be liked to positively correlate with entrainment. Speakers who are perceived as trying to dominate may be overly entraining to their interlocutors in what is sometimes called “dependency overaccommodation.” Dependency overaccommodation causes the interlocutor to appear dependent on the speaker and gives the impression that the speaker is controlling the conversation (West &amp; Turner, 2009). The results of our correlations of social variables with acoustic/prosodic entrainment are generally consonant with these intuitions. Although it is not straightforward to</context>

This idea is supported by Natale’s finding that the need for social approval is predictive of the degree of a speaker’s convergence on intensity (Natale, 1975). We can therefore expect trying to be liked to positively correlate with entrainment. Speakers who are perceived as trying to dominate may be overly entraining to their interlocutors in what is sometimes called “dependency overaccommodation.” Dependency overaccommodation causes the interlocutor to appear dependent on the speaker and gives the impression that the speaker is controlling the conversation (West &amp; Turner, 2009). The results of our correlations of social variables with acoustic/prosodic entrainment are generally consonant with these intuitions. Although it is not straightforward to compare correlation coefficients of groups for which we have varying amounts of data, for purposes of assessing trends, we will consider a correlation strong if it is significant at the p &lt; 0.00001 level, moderate at the p &lt; 0.01 level, and weak at the p &lt; 0.05 level.
