Task-solving in dialogue depends on the lin-
guistic alignment of the interlocutors, which
Pickering &amp; Garrod (2004) have suggested
to be based on mechanistic repetition ef-
fects. In this paper, we seek confirmation
of this hypothesis by looking at repetition
in corpora, and whether repetition is cor-
related with task success. We show that
the relevant repetition tendency is based on
slow adaptation rather than short-term prim-
ing and demonstrate that lexical and syntac-
tic repetition is a reliable predictor of task
success given the first five minutes of a task-

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999913321428571">
While humans are remarkably efficient, flexible and
reliable communicators, we are far from perfect.
Our dialogues differ in how successfully informa-
tion is conveyed. In task-oriented dialogue, where
the interlocutors are communicating to solve a prob-
lem, task success is a crucial indicator of the success
of the communication.
An automatic measure of task success would be
useful for evaluating conversations among humans,
e.g., for evaluating agents in a call center. In human-
computer dialogues, predicting the task success after
just a first few turns of the conversation could avoid
disappointment: if the conversation isn’t going well,
a caller may be passed on to a human operator, or
the system may switch dialogue strategies. As a first
step, we focus on human-human dialogue, since cur-
rent spoken dialogue systems do not yet yield long,
syntactically complex conversations.
In this paper, we use syntactic and lexical features
to predict task success in an environment where we
assume no speaker model, no semantic information
and no information typical for a human-computer
dialogue system, e.g., ASR confidence. The fea-
tures we use are based on a psychological theory,
linking alignment between dialogue participants to
low-level syntactic priming. An examination of this
priming reveals differences between short-term and
long-term effects.

In their Interactive Alignment Model (IAM), Pick-
ering and Garrod (2004) suggest that dialogue be-
tween humans is greatly aided by aligning repre-
sentations on several linguistic and conceptual lev-
els. This effect is assumed to be driven by a cas-
cade of linguistic priming effects, where interlocu-
tors tend to re-use lexical, syntactic and other lin-
guistic structures after their introduction. Such re-
use leads speakers to agree on a common situa-
tion model. Several studies have shown that speak-
ers copy their interlocutor’s syntax (Branigan et al.,
1999). This effect is usually referred to as structural
(or: syntactic) priming. These persistence effects
are inter-related, as lexical repetition implies pref-
erences for syntactic choices, and syntactic choices
lead to preferred semantic interpretations. Without
demanding additional cognitive resources, the ef-
fects form a causal chain that will benefit the inter-
locutor’s purposes. Or, at the very least, it will be
easier for them to repeat linguistic choices than to

1.2 Structural priming
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9598501">
The repetition effect at the center of this paper, prim-
ing, is defined as a tendency to repeat linguistic de-
cisions. Priming has been shown to affect language
production and, to a lesser extent, comprehension, at
different levels of linguistic analysis. This tendency
may show up in various ways, for instance in the
case of lexical priming as a shorter response time in
lexical decision making tasks, or as a preference for
one syntactic construction over an alternative one in
syntactic priming (Bock, 1986). In an experimental
study (Branigan et al., 1999), subjects were primed
by completing either sentence (1a) or (1b):
1a. The racing driver showed the torn overall...
1b. The racing driver showed the helpful mechanic...
Sentence (1a) was to be completed with a prepo-
sitional object (“to the helpful mechanic”), while
(1b) required a double object construction (“the torn
overall”). Subsequently, subjects were allowed to
freely complete a sentence such as the following
one, describing a picture they were shown:
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.435925" genericHeader="introduction">
2. The patient showed...
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99912125">
Subjects were more likely to complete (2) with a
double-object construction when primed with (1b),
and with a prepositional object construction when
primed with (1a).
In a previous corpus-study, using transcriptions
of spontaneous, task-oriented and non-task-oriented
dialogue, utterances were annotated with syntactic
trees, which we then used to determine the phrase-
structure rules that licensed production (and com-
prehension) of the utterances (Reitter et al., 2006b).
For each rule, the time of its occurrence was noted,
e.g. we noted
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.990913">
3. 117.9s NP AT AP NN a fenced meadow
4. 125.5s NP AT AP NN the abandoned cottage
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99991925">
In this study, we then found that the re-occurrence
of a rule (as in 4) was correlated with the temporal
distance to the first occurrence (3), e.g., 7.6 seconds.
The shorter the distance between prime (3) and tar-
get (4), the more likely were rules to re-occur.
In a conversation, priming may lead a speaker
to choose a verb over a synonym because their in-
terlocutor has used it a few seconds before. This,
in turn, will increase the likelihood of the struc-
tural form of the arguments in the governed verbal
phrase–simply because lexical items have their pref-
erences for particular syntactic structures, but also
because structural priming may be stronger if lexi-
cal items are repeated (lexical boost, Pickering and
Branigan (1998)). Additionally, the structural prim-
ing effects introduced above will make a previously
observed or produced syntactic structure more likely
to be re-used. This chain reaction leads interlocu-
tors in dialogue to reach a common situation model.
Note that the IAM, in which interlocutors automati-
cally and cheaply build a common representation of
common knowledge, is at odds with views that af-
ford each dialogue participant an explicit and sepa-
rate representation of their interlocutor’s knowledge.
The connection between linguistic persistence or
priming effects and the success of dialogue is cru-
cial for the IAM. The predictions arising from this,
however, have eluded testing so far. In our previous
study (Reitter et al., 2006b), we found more syn-
tactic priming in the task-oriented dialogues of the
Map Task corpus than in the spontaneous conversa-
tion collected in the Switchboard corpus. However,
we compared priming effects across two datasets,
where participants and conversation topics differed
greatly. Switchboard contains spontaneous conver-
sation over the telephone, while the task-oriented
Map Task corpus was recorded with interlocutors
co-present. While the result (more priming in
task-oriented dialogue) supported the predictions of
IAM, cognitive load effects could not be distin-
guished from priming. In the current study, we ex-
amine structural repetition in task-oriented dialogue
only and focus on an extrinsic measure, namely task
success.

Repetition is measured on a lexical and a syntactic
level. To do so, we identify all constituents in the
utterances as per phrase-structure analysis. [Go [to
[the [[white house] [on [the right]]]]]] would yield
11 constituents. Each constituent is licensed by a
syntactic rule, for instance VP —* V PP for the top-
most constituent in the above example.
For each constituent, we check whether it is a lex-
ical or syntactic repetition, i.e. if the same words
occurred before, or if the licensing rule has occurred
before in the same dialogue. If so, we increment
counters for lexical and/or syntactic repetitions, and
increase a further counter for string repetition by the
length of the phrase (in characters). The latter vari-
able accounts for the repetition of long phrases.
We include a data point for each 10-second inter-
val of the dialogue, with features reporting the lexi-
cal (LEXREP), syntactic (SYNREP) and character-
based (CHARREP) repetitions up to that point in
time. A time stamp and the total numbers of con-
stituents and characters are also included (LENGTH).
This way, the model may work with repetition pro-
portions rather than the absolute counts.
We train a support vector machine for regression
with a radial basis function kernel (&apos;y = 5), using the
features as described above and the PATHDEV score
as output.

For Task 1 (full dialogues), the results (Table 1)

Obviously, linguistic information alone will not ex-
plain the majority of the task-solving abilities. Apart
from subject-related factors, communicative strate-
gies will play a role.
However, linguistic repetition serves as a good
predictor of how well interlocutors will complete
their joint task. The features used are relatively sim-
ple: provided there is some syntactic annotation,
rule repetition can easily be detected. Even with-
out syntactic information, lexical repetition already
goes a long way.
But what kind of repetition is it that plays a role in
task-oriented dialogue? Leaving out features is not
an ideal method to quantify their influence–in par-
ticular, where features inter-correlate. The contribu-
tion of syntactic repetition is still unclear from the

the course of the whole dialogues, but not within a
5-minute time span, where the SVM cannot incor-
porate its informational content.
We will therefore turn to a more detailed analysis
of structural repetition, which should help us draw
conclusions relating to the psycholinguistics of dia-
logue.

4 Long term and short term priming
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999963771428571">
In the following, we will examine syntactic (struc-
tural) priming as one of the driving forces behind
alignment. We choose syntactic over lexical priming
for two reasons. Lexical repetition due to priming is
difficult to distinguish from repetition that is due to
interlocutors attending to a particular topic of con-
versation, which, in coherent dialogue, means that
topics are clustered. Lexical choice reflects those
topics, hence we expect clusters of particular termi-
nology. Secondly: the maps used to collect the dia-
logues in the Map Task corpus contained landmarks
with labels. It is only natural (even if by means
to cross-modal priming) that speakers will identify
landmarks using the labels and show little variability
in lexical choice. We will measure repetition of syn-
tactic rules, whereby word-by-word repetition (topi-
cality effects, parroting) is explicitly excluded.
For syntactic priming1, two repetition effects
have been identified. Classical priming effects are
strong: around 10% for syntactic rules (Reitter et al.,
2006b). However, they decay quickly (Branigan
et al., 1999) and reach a low plateau after a few sec-
onds, which likens to the effect to semantic (similar-
ity) priming. What complicates matters is that there
is also a different, long-term adaptation effect that is
also commonly called (repetition) priming.
Adaptation has been shown to last longer, from
minutes (Bock and Griffin, 2000) to several days.
Lexical boost interactions, where the lexical rep-
etition of material within the repeated structure
strengthens structural priming, have been observed
for short-term priming, but not for long-term prim-
ing trials where material intervened between prime
and target utterances (Konopka and Bock, 2005).
Thus, short- and long-term adaptation effects may

well be due to separate cognitive processes, as re-
cently argued by (Ferreira and Bock, 2006). Section
5 deals with decay-based short-term priming, Sec-
tion 6 with long-term adaptation.
Pickering and Garrod (2004) do not make the type
of priming supporting alignment explicit. Should
we find differences in the way task success interacts
with different kinds of repetition effects, then this
would be a good indication about what effect sup-
ports IAM. More concretely, we could say whether
alignment is due to the automatic, classical priming
effect, or whether it is based on a long-term effect
that is possibly closer to implicit learning (Chang
et al., 2006).

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999988428571428">
In this section, we attempt to detect differences in
the strength of short-term priming in successful and
less successful dialogues. To do so, we use the mea-
sure of priming strength established by Reitter et al.
(2006b), which then allows us to test whether prim-
ing interacts with task success. Under the assump-
tions of IAM we would expect successful dialogues
to show more priming than unsuccessful ones.
Obviously, difficulties with the task at hand may
be due to a range of problems that the subjects may
have, linguistic and otherwise. But given that the di-
alogues contain variable levels of syntactic priming,
one would expect that this has at least some influ-
ence on the outcome of the task.

Long-term adaptation is a form of priming that
occurs over minutes and could, therefore, support
linguistic and situation model alignment in task-
oriented dialogue. IAM and the success of the
SVM based method could be based on such an ef-
fect instead of short-term priming. Analogous to the
the previous experiment, we hypothesize that more
adaptation relates to more task success.

After the initial few seconds, structural repetition
shows little decay, but can be demonstrated even
minutes or longer after the stimulus. To measure this
type of adapation, we need a different strategy to es-
timate the size of this effect.
While short-term priming can be pin-pointed us-
ing the characteristic decay, for long-term priming
we need to inspect whole dialogues and construct
and contrast dialogues where priming is possible and
ones where it is not. Factor SAMEDOC distinguishes
the two situations: 1) Priming can happen in con-
tiguous dialogues. We treat the first half of the dia-
logue as priming period, and the rule instances in the
second half as targets. 2) The control case is when
priming cannot have taken place, i.e., between unre-
lated dialogues. Prime period and targets stem from
separate randomly sampled dialogue halves that al-
ways come from different dialogues.
Thus, our model (PRIME — SAMEDOC �
PATHDEV) estimates the influence of priming on
rule us. From a Bayesian perspective, we would
say that the second kind of data (non-priming) al-
low the model to estimate a prior for rule repetitions.
The goal is now to establish a correlation between
SAMEDOC and the existence of repetition. If and
only if there is long-term adapation would we ex-
pect such a correlation.
Analogous to the short-term priming model, we

Long-term repetition showed a positive priming ef-
fect (SAMEDOC, b = 3.303,p &lt; 0.0001). This
generalizes previous experimental priming results in
long-term priming.
Long-term-repetition did not inter-
act with (normalized) rule frequency
(SAMEDOC:log(RULEFREQ, b = —0.044,p =
0.35). The interaction was removed for all other
parameters reported.4
The effect interacted reliably with the path
deviation scores (SAMEDOC:PATHDEV, b =
—0.624,p &lt; 0.05). We find a reliable correlation
of task success and syntactic priming. Stronger path
deviations relate to weaker priming.

tion of IAM. Also, there is no evidence for stronger
long-term adaptation of rare rules, which may point
out a qualitative difference to short-term priming.
Of course, this correlation does not necessarily in-
dicate a causal relationship. However, participants
in Map Task did not receive an explicit indication
about whether they were on the “right track”. Mis-
takes, such as passing a landmark on its East and
not on the West side, were made and went unno-
ticed. Thus, it is not very likely that task success
caused alignment to improve at large. We suspect
such a possibility, however, for very unsuccessful
dialogues. A closer look at the correlation (Figure
1) reveals that while adaptation indeed decreases as
task success decreases, adaptation increased again
for some of the least successful dialogues. It is pos-
sible that here, miscoordination became apparent to
the participants, who then tried to switch strategies.
Or, simply put: too much alignment (and too little
risk-taking) is unhelpful. Further, qualitative, work
needs to be done to investigate this hypothesis.
From an applied perspective, the correlation
shows that of the repetition effects included in our
task-success prediction model, it is long-term syn-
tactic adaptation as opposed to the more automatic
short-term priming effect that contributes to predic-
tion accuracy. We take this as an indication to in-
clude adaptation rather than just priming in a model
of alignment in dialogue.

7 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999870842105263">
Task success in human-human dialogue is
predictable–the more successfully speakers collab-
orate, the more they show linguistic adaptation.
This confirms our initial hypothesis of IAM. In the
applied model, knowledge of lexical and syntactic
repetition helps to determine task success even after
just a few minutes of the conversation.
We suggested two application-oriented tasks (es-
timating and predicting task success) and an ap-
proach to address them. They now provide an op-
portunity to explore and exploit other linguistic and
extra-linguistic parameters.
The second contribution is a closer inspection of
structural repetition, which showed that it is long-
term adaptation that varies with task success, while
short-term priming appears largely autonomous.
Long-term adaptation may thus be a strategy that
aids dialogue partners in aligning their language and
their situation models.

In this paper, we seek confirmation of this hypothesis by looking at repetition in corpora, and whether repetition is correlated with task success. We show that the relevant repetition tendency is based on slow adaptation rather than short-term priming and demonstrate that lexical and syntactic repetition is a reliable predictor of task success given the first five minutes of a taskoriented dialogue.</abstract>

This effect is assumed to be driven by a cascade of linguistic priming effects, where interlocutors tend to re-use lexical, syntactic and other linguistic structures after their introduction. Such reuse leads speakers to agree on a common situation model. Several studies have shown that speakers copy their interlocutor’s syntax (Branigan et al., 1999). This effect is usually referred to as structural (or: syntactic) priming. These persistence effects are inter-related, as lexical repetition implies preferences for syntactic choices, and syntactic choices lead to preferred semantic interpretations. Without demanding additional cognitive resources, the effects form a causal chain that will benefit the interlocutor’s purposes. Or, at the very least, it will be easier for them to repeat linguistic choices than to 808 Proceedings of the 45th Annual Meeting of the Association of Computational Linguistics, pages 808–815, Prague, Czech Republic, J</context>

Secondly: the maps used to collect the dialogues in the Map Task corpus contained landmarks with labels. It is only natural (even if by means to cross-modal priming) that speakers will identify landmarks using the labels and show little variability in lexical choice. We will measure repetition of syntactic rules, whereby word-by-word repetition (topicality effects, parroting) is explicitly excluded. For syntactic priming1, two repetition effects have been identified. Classical priming effects are strong: around 10% for syntactic rules (Reitter et al., 2006b).

To do so, we use the measure of priming strength established by Reitter et al. (2006b), which then allows us to test whether priming interacts with task success. Under the assumptions of IAM we would expect successful dialogues to show more priming than unsuccessful ones. Obviously, difficulties with the task at hand may be due to a range of problems that the subjects may have, linguistic and otherwise. But given that the dialogues contain </context>

The shorter the distance between prime (3) and target (4), the more likely were rules to re-occur. In a conversation, priming may lead a speaker to choose a verb over a synonym because their interlocutor has used it a few seconds before. This, in turn, will increase the likelihood of the structural form of the arguments in the governed verbal phrase–simply because lexical items have their preferences for particular syntactic structures, but also because structural priming may be stronger if lexical items are repeated (lexical boost, Pickering and Branigan (1998)). Additionally, the structural priming effects introduced above will make a previously observed or produced syntactic structure more likely to be re-used. This chain reaction leads interlocutors in dialogue to reach a common situation model. Note that the IAM, in which interlocutors automatically and cheaply build a common representation of common knowledge, is at odds with views that afford each dialogue participant an explicit and separate representation of their interlocutor’s knowledge.

In this paper, we use syntactic and lexical features to predict task success in an environment where we assume no speaker model, no semantic information and no information typical for a human-computer dialogue system, e.g., ASR confidence. The features we use are based on a psychological theory, linking alignment between dialogue participants to low-level syntactic priming. An examination of this priming reveals differences between short-term and long-term effects. 1.1 Repetition supports dialogue In their Interactive Alignment Model (IAM), Pickering and Garrod (2004) suggest that dialogue between humans is greatly aided by aligning representations on several linguistic and conceptual levels. This effect is assumed to be driven by a cascade of linguistic priming effects, where interlocutors tend to re-use lexical, syntactic and other linguistic structures after their introduction. Such reuse leads speakers to agree on a common situation model. Several studies have shown that speakers copy their interlocutor’s syntax (Branigan et al., 1999). This effect is usually referred to as structural (or: syntactic) priming. These persistence effects are inter-related</context>

The connection between linguistic persistence or priming effects and the success of dialogue is crucial for the IAM. The predictions arising from this, however, have eluded testing so far. In our previous study (Reitter et al., 2006b), we found more syntactic priming in the task-oriented dialogues of the Map Task corpus than in the spontaneous conversation collected in the Switchboard corpus.

For syntactic priming1, two repetition effects have been identified. Classical priming effects are strong: around 10% for syntactic rules (Reitter et al., 2006b). However, they decay quickly (Branigan et al., 1999) and reach a low plateau after a few seconds, which likens to the effect to semantic (similarity) priming.
