Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.9997855">
The reliable extraction of knowledge from text
requires an appropriate treatment of the time
at which reported events take place. Unfortu-
nately, there are very few annotated data sets
that support the development of techniques for
event time-stamping and tracking the progres-
sion of time through a narrative. In this paper,
we present a new corpus of temporally-rich
documents sourced from English Wikipedia,
which we have annotated with TIMEX2 tags.
The corpus contains around 120000 tokens,
and 2600 TIMEX2 expressions, thus compar-
ing favourably in size to other existing corpora
used in these areas. We describe the prepa-
ration of the corpus, and compare the profile
of the data with other existing temporally an-
notated corpora. We also report the results
obtained when we use DANTE, our temporal
expression tagger, to process this corpus, and
point to where further work is required. The
corpus is publicly available for research pur-
poses.

The reliable processing of temporal information is
an important step in many NLP applications, such
as information extraction, question answering, and
document summarisation. Consequently, the tasks
of identifying and assigning values to temporal ex-
pressions have recently received significant attention,
resulting in the creation of mature corpus annotation
guidelines (e.g. TIMEX21 and TimeML2), publicly

a number of automatic taggers (see, for example,
(Mani and Wilson, 2000; Schilder, 2004; Hacioglu et
al., 2005; Negri and Marseglia, 2005; Saquete, 2005;

However, existing corpora have their limitations.
In particular, the documents in these corpora tend to
be limited in length and, in consequence, discourse
structure. This impacts on the number, range and
variety of temporal expressions they contain. Ex-
isting research carried out on the interpretation of
temporal expressions, e.g. by (Baldwin, 2002; Ahn
et al., 2005; Mazur and Dale, 2008), suggests that
many temporal expressions in documents, especially
news stories, can be interpreted fairly simply as be-
ing relative to a reference date that is typically the
document creation date. This phenomenon does not
carry over to longer, more narrative-style documents
that describe extended sequences of events, as found,
for example, in biographies or descriptions of pro-
tracted geo-political events. Consequently, existing
corpora are not ideal as development data for systems
intended to work on such historical narrations.
In this paper we introduce a new annotated corpus
of temporal expressions that is intended to address
this shortfall. The corpus, which we call WikiWars,
consists of 22 documents from English Wikipedia
that describe the historical course of wars. Despite
the small number of documents, their length means
that the corpus yields a large number of temporal
expressions, and poses new challenges for tracking

The rest of this paper is organised as follows. In
Section 2 we describe related work, focusing on the
TIMEX2 annotation scheme, and existing corpora
that contain annotations of temporal expressions us-
ing this scheme. Section 3 describes the process of
creation of the WikiWars corpus. In Section 4 we
comment on some artefacts of Wikipedia articles that
impact on the annotation process and the use of this
corpus. Then, in Section 5 we analyse the differences
between the WikiWars corpus and the widely-used
ACE corpora. In Section 6 we report on the perfor-
mance of our temporal expression tagger on this data
set. Finally, in Section 7, we conclude.

<bodyText confidence="0.999602260869565">
At the time of writing, there are two mature, wide-
coverage schemes for the annotation of temporal in-
formation in texts: TIMEX2 (Ferro et al., 2005) and
TimeML (Pustejovsky et al., 2003; Boguraev et al.,
2005), which is soon to become an ISO standard
(Pustejovsky et al., 2010).
These schemes were used to annotate corpora that
are often used in research on temporal expression
recognition and normalisation: the series of corpora
used for training and evaluation in the Automatic
Content Extraction (ACE) program6 run in 2004,
2005 and 2007, and the TimeBank Corpus.
The ACE corpora were prepared for the devel-
opment and evaluation of systems participating in
the ACE program. However, the evaluation corpora
have never been publicly released, and thus are cur-
rently, for all practical purposes, unavailable. The
ACE 2004 corpus contains news data only (broad-
cast news, newspaper and newswire), while the ACE
2005 and 2007 corpora contain news (broadcast and
newswire), conversations (broadcast and telephone),
UseNet discussions and web blogs. The 2005 and
2007 ACE corpora are annotated with the latest ver-

sion of TIMEX2 (2005), while the 2004 corpus is
annotated with the older 2003 version of TIMEX2;
however, the differences are not very significant.
Apart from the unavailability of the evaluation
data, there are two issues with the ACE corpora. One
is that most of the documents are relatively short, so
that the average number of temporal expressions per
document is low (typically between seven and nine
per document, including the document time stamp
as a metadata element). This results in very lim-
ited temporal discourse structure, and relatively few
underspecified and relative temporal expressions. Un-
fortunately, these are the more difficult temporal ex-
pressions to handle, and so the ACE corpora may
not serve as a good baseline for performance more
generally.
A second problem is that the ACE corpora appear
to contain a significant number of errors in the gold
standard annotations, with respect to both the anno-
tated extents and the semantic values assigned, which
do not always follow the TIMEX2 guidelines.
TimeBank v1.2 is a revised and improved version
of TimeBank 1.1 resulting in a number of errors fixed
and inconsistencies removed (see (Boguraev et al.,
2007)). Unfortunely, this corpus has the same lim-
itations as the ACE corpora in regard to document
length and complexity of discourse structure. Fur-
ther, TimeBank is annotated with TimeML, a scheme
more complex than TIMEX2 since it also encom-
passes the tagging of events and temporal relations.
However, TIMEX2 is sufficiently sophisticated for
the annotation of most types of temporal expressions,
and our review of the literature reveals that the ma-
jority of existing temporal taggers output TIMEX2
annotations. Since automatic conversion between
TIMEX2 and TimeML annotations is not straightfor-
ward, TimeBank is of limited use for those who work
specifically with TIMEX2.

Given the above concerns, we were particularly inter-
ested in developing a corpus that would allow more
rigorous testing of techniques for tracking time across
extended narratives, since these give rise to more
complex temporal phenomena than are found in sim-
pler documents. To avoid copyright issues that might

we settled on descriptions of the course of wars and
conflicts as being particularly rich in the kinds of
phenomena we wanted to explore.

3.1 Selecting Data
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999993">
We queried Google with two phrases, ‘most famous
wars in history’ and ‘the biggest wars’, and in each
case chose the top-ranked result. One of the pages
found proposed a list of the 10 most famous wars
in history, and the other listed the names of the 20
biggest wars that happened in the 20th century, mea-
sured in terms of the number of military deaths. We
combined the two lists, eliminated duplicates, and
searched Wikipedia for articles describing these wars.
Wikipedia did not contain an article for one war, and
we considered two articles as inappropriate for our
purposes since they did not describe the course of the
wars, but rather some general information about the
conflicts. This resulted in a final set of 22 articles.
More details of the selection process and the URLs
of the chosen Wikipedia articles are provided in the
documentation distributed with the corpus.

3.2 Text Extraction and Preprocessing
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999891952380952">
To prepare the corpus, we first manually copied text
from those sections of the webpages that described
the course of the wars. This involved manual re-
moval of picture captions and cross-page links. We
then ran a script over the results of this extraction pro-
cess to convert some Unicode characters into ASCII
(ligatures, spaces, apostrophes, hyphens and other
punctuation marks), and to remove citation links and
a variety of other Wikipedia annotations.
Finally, we converted each of the text files into
an SGML file: each document was wrapped in one
DOC tag, inside which there are DOCID, DOCTYPE
and DATETIME tags. The document time stamp is the
date and time at which we downloaded the page from
Wikipedia to our local repository. The proper content
of the article is wrapped in a TEXT tag. This docu-
ment structure intentionally follows that of the ACE
2005 and 2007 documents, so as to make the pro-
cessing and evaluation of the WikiWars data highly
compatible with the tools used to process the ACE
corpora.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999813">
3.3 Creating Gold Standard Annotations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999983380952381">
Having prepared the input SGML documents, we
then processed them with the DANTE temporal
expression tagger (see Mazur and Dale (2007)).
DANTE outputs the original SGML documents aug-
mented with an inline TIMEX2 annotation for each
temporal expression found. These output files can
be imported to Callisto,7 an annotation tool that sup-
ports TIMEX2 annotations. Using a temporal ex-
pression tagger as a first-pass annotation tool not
only significantly reduces the amount of human an-
notation effort required (creating a tag from scratch
requires a number of clicks in the annotation tool),
but also helps to minimize the number of errors that
arise from overlooking markable expressions through
‘annotator blindness’. The annotations produced by
DANTE were then manually corrected in Callisto
via the following process. First, Annotator 1 (the
first author) corrected all the annotations produced
by DANTE, both in terms of extent and the values
provided for TIMEX2 attributes. This process also
included the annotation of any temporal expression
missed by the automatic tagger, and the removal of
spurious matches. Then, Annotator 2 (the second au-
thor) checked all the revised annotations and prepared
a list of errors found and doubts or queries in regard
to potentially problematic annotations. Annotator 1
then verified and fixed the errors, after discussion in
the case of disagreements.
The final SGML files containing inline annotations
were then transformed into ACE APF XML annota-
tion files, this being the stand-off markup format
developed for ACE evaluations. This transformation
was carried out using the tern2apf tool developed
by NIST for the ACE 2004 evaluations, with some
modifications introduced by us to adjust the tool to
support ACE 2005 documents and to add a document
ID as part of the ID of a TIMEX2 annotation (so that
all annotations would have corpus-wide unique IDs).
The resulting corpus is thus available in two for-
mats: one contains the original documents enriched
with inline annotations, and the other consists of
stand-off annotations in the ACE APF format.

3.4 Some Deficiencies of TIMEX2
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999888559322034">
The annotation process described above revealed
some issues with the use of TIMEX2 in practice.
First, the flexibility of the TIMEX2 scheme, which
can be at first seen as an advantage, actually makes
it ambiguous. One instance of this phenomenon re-
lates to the fact that the TIMEX2 guidelines state that
the provision of some attribute values for what are
called event-based expressions (such as three weeks
after the siege of Boston began or the first year of the
American invasion) is optional. Since our corpus has
a significant number of such expressions, the deci-
sion as to whether or not to provide semantic values
in such cases has a potentially large impact on the
perceived performance of a tagger. In such cases,
we decided only to provide the value when it is very
clear from the article itself what the value should be.
Another area where TIMEX2 is not ideal is in
regard to the annotation of time zones. First, only
whole-hour time differences are supported, which
eliminates some time zones (e.g. Afghanistan lies
in UTC+04:30). Second, time zone information is
supposed to be marked only for expressions which
have it explicitly stated. However, it can often be
inferred from the context that subsequent unadorned
time references should inherit the same time zone as
an earlier time reference.
We also found that, in a not insignificant number
of cases, it is impossible to provide a precise and
correct value for a temporal expression. For example,
the TIMEX2 guidelines stipulate that the anchors
of durations cannot have a MOD attribute, so if the
anchor is mid-August, the value of the anchor must
refer to August, which is not entirely correct as the
semantics of mid- is lost.
TIMEX2 only supports nonspecific expressions
which have explicit information about granularity.
Expressions such as a very short time or a short
period of time therefore cannot be provided with any
value, since the context does not indicate whether the
period involved should be measured in days, weeks,
or months. One might consider using the typical
durations of events of the corresponding types in
such cases, but this solution also has problems (see
(Pan et al., 2006)).
As is acknowledged in the TIMEX2 guidelines,
the treatment of set expressions (i.e. recurring times
and durations and frequencies, e.g. twice a month) is
underdeveloped. One rule states that set expressions
should not be anchored (Ferro et al., 2005, p. 42);
this has the consequence that the full semantics of the
expression annually since 1955 cannot be provided,
and the expression is therefore treated as two separate
expressions, annually and 1955.
Finally, alternative calendars are not supported, so
an expression like February in the pre-revolutionary
Russian calendar cannot receive a value unless it ap-
pears in an appositive construction which provides
an alternative description. Similarly, consider Exam-
ple (1):
</bodyText>

</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.9935856">
Here, 18 Brumaire of the Year VIII is a date in an
alternative calendar used in France, but we annotated
only the Year VIII based on the trigger year. Note
that 18 Brumaire also occurs later in the sentence,
but is not annotated.

3.5 Corpus Statistics
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.955850166666667">
The corpus contains 22 documents with a total of
almost 120,000 tokens8 and 2,671 temporal expres-
sions annotated in TIMEX2 format. In Table 1 we
compare the WikiWars corpus with the other exist-
ing corpora. While the ACE 2005 Training corpus
remains the largest corpus, WikiWars is larger than
the ACE 2005 and 2007 evaluation corpora and the
TimeBank v1.2 corpus, both in terms of number of
tokens and TIMEX2 annotations. WikiWars has an
order of magnitude more temporal expressions in
each document, and a slightly higher density of tem-
poral expressions than the other corpora.
Table 2 presents statistics on the individual doc-
uments that make up the corpus. The documents
vary considerably in size, the smallest consisting of
only 1,455 tokens, and the largest being eight times
larger at 11,640 tokens. The density of TIMEX2 an-
notations varies from 1 in 23.1 tokens to 1 in 72.1
tokens, but for the majority of documents the ratio
lies between 30 and 60.
8All token counts presented in Tables 1 and 2 were obtained
using GATE’s default English tokeniser; hyphenated words, e.g.
British-held and co-operation, were treated as single tokens. For
more information on GATE see (Cunningham et al., 2002).

4 The Nature of Wikipedia Articles
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997286918918919">
Wikipedia articles may be edited by a large number
of people over a significant number of revisions. We
checked how often the articles constituting WikiWars
were modified in the period from January 2008 to
February 2010. On average, each article was changed
almost 52 times per month, with the monthly number
of changes for a single article ranging from 1 to 372.9
The minimum average for an individual document
was 13.08 (17 AlgerianWar), and the maximum was
171.77 (07 IraqWar).
The nature of the revision process in Wikipedia
leads to some artefacts that may be not typical
of other document sources, such as news, where
the text is usually carefully prepared by its author
and checked by an editor. This is not to say that
Wikipedia content is necessarily of low quality; this
is an encyclopedia with many people and bots con-
trolling its quality, and there exist manuals of style
for authors to help them avoid errors and ambigu-
ity and to ensure maximum consistency.10 However,
given the large number of editors with various de-
grees of fluency and experience in writing and edit-
ing, it would not be surprising if some parts of the
texts are not perfect. In the process of preparing the
gold standard annotations for the WikiWars corpus,
we have made the following observations.
9Note that these numbers are for the articles as a whole,
and not just the sections which we extracted (although these
are usually the major part of the article). Additionally, these
edits include both major changes (e.g. adding a new section),
minor changes (e.g. correcting a grammar error or adding a
comma), vandalism (deletion of the page content or the on-
purpose provision of false information) and restoring the page
after an act of vandalism has been detected.

ing dates and numbers, located at http://en.wikipedia.

4.1 Broken Narratives
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993445260869565">
In some articles we have found situations where a
sentence does not appear to cohere with those on
either side of it. This may be the result of a num-
ber of modifications made by different authors, or
it may be due to a lack of writing skill on the part
of the person who wrote the paragraph in question.
Example (2) below provides an example of this phe-
nomenon: the sentence about de Gaulle being elected
president contains a temporal expression which pro-
gresses the temporal focus in the narrative to 1959,
but the later context of the article strongly suggests
that the subsequent reference to October is in fact
October 1958.
(2) ALN commandos committed numer-
ous acts of sabotage in France in
August[1958], and the FLN mounted a desper-
ate campaign of terror in Algeria to intimidate
Muslims into boycotting the referendum. Despite
threats of reprisal, however, 80 percent of the Muslim
electorate turned out to vote in September[1958], and
of these 96 percent approved the constitution. In
February 1959, de Gaulle was elected president of
the new Fifth Republic. He visited Constantine in

October[1958] to announce a program to end the war
and create an Algeria closely linked to France.
It would appear that the reference to February 1959 is
a later addition to the text which has been made with-
out the surrounding text being appropriately revised
to accommodate this change. Clearly such instances
of incoherence will cause problems for any process
that attempts to track the temporal focus.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99648">
4.2 Ambiguous Writing
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.988073509433962">
We have also found cases of a lack of precision in
writing, which leads to ambiguous statements. Con-
sider the following example:
(3) The Afghan government, having secured a treaty in
December 1978 that allowed them to call on Soviet
forces, repeatedly requested the introduction of troops
in Afghanistan in the spring and summer of 1979.
They requested Soviet troops to provide security and
to assist in the fight against the mujahideen rebels.
On April 14, 1979, the Afghan government requested
that the USSR send 15 to 20 helicopters with their
crews to Afghanistan, and on June 16, the Soviet gov-
ernment responded and sent a detachment of tanks,
BMPs, and crews to guard the government in Kabul
and to secure the Bagram and Shindand airfields. In
response to this request, an airborne battalion, com-
manded by Lieutenant Colonel A. Lomakin, arrived
at the Bagram Air Base on July 7. [... ]
After a month, the Afghan requests were no longer
for individual crews and subunits, but for regiments
and larger units. In July, the Afghan government
requested that two motorized rifle divisions be sent
to Afghanistan. The following day, they requested an
airborne division in addition to the earlier requests.
Here, in the first paragraph there are four temporal
expressions related to the Afghan government asking
for troops and equipment. There is also one date
related to the Soviets’ reply to these requests and
sending of tanks, and one date related to the arrival
of an airborne battalion. The second paragraph starts
with after a month; the first possible interpretation is
that this is a month after the 7th July mentioned in
the previous paragraph; i.e. the month would end on
the 6th of August. But the following sentence reveals
that this is not the case, as it mentions some requests
for larger units that were made in July. Usually a
narrative progresses forwards in time, not backwards,
so the month must start either on 14th April or 16th
June: if the second sentence elaborates the first one,
then it is a month from 16th June; if it just mentions
one of the requests for larger units, then it is probably
a month from 14th April.
It is also unclear whether the second paragraph
talks about the same request for airborne forces which
was mentioned in the first paragraph: both these
events are dated July. The phrase In response to
this request is in fact placed very oddly, as its pre-
ceding sentence does not mention any request, but
rather talks about the Soviets’ response to requests.
This may suggest that what at first looks just like a
careless and ambiguous use of the expression after a
month is in fact a larger problem of lack of coherency
in these two paragraphs.

4.3 Use of Deictic Expressions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.919843515151515">
One of the articles, 07 TraqWar, contained a num-
ber of deictic temporal expressions, indicative of the
fact that the events described were happening con-
temporaneously to the time of writing (as is often the
case in news stories); for example:
(4) a. Democrats plan to push legislation this spring
that would force the Iraqi government to spend
its own surplus to rebuild.
b. A protester said that despite the approval of the
Interim Security pact, the Iraqi people would
break it in a referendum next year.
Obviously, after some time these expressions will no
longer make sense, since there is no ‘at-the-time-of-
writing’ time stamp associated with these sentences:
for the reader of a Wikipedia article, the reference
date is the time of reading. In the case of the above
example, these sentences were written in April and
December 2008, respectively.11 Arguably, these sen-
tences should be corrected, making the temporal ex-
pressions fully-specified (e.g. in spring of 2009 and
in 2009), or context-dependent (e.g. in spring of
that year and the following year) if there is a context
in the article which supports their correct interpreta-
tion. Of course, not only the temporal expressions
need to be revised, but also the tense and aspect of
the verbs used in the sentences. In the gold stan-
dard annotations, however, we provided the values
by interpreting these expressions with respect to the
document time stamp (i.e. 2010-SP and 2010), as
the text itself does not provide any evidence that other
dates were intended.
11Somewhat laborious document archaeology allows this in-
formation to be extracted from Wikipedia’s archive.

4.4 Use of Time Zone Information
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9745831875">
Consider the following example, which comes from
the article 01 WW2:
(5) On December 7 (December 8 in Asian time zones),
1941, Japan attacked British and American holdings
with near simultaneous offensives against Southeast
Asia and the Central Pacific.
The italicized temporal expression is difficult to de-
tect, and it is not clear how it should be annotated.
But it is also imprecise with respect to which time
zone is intended: Asia encompasses 10 time zones.
Therefore it is impossible to fully interpret the ex-
pression. Note also that the expression combines a
time zone with a date, rather than with a time. While
uncommon, this is not incorrect; but the TIMEX2
guidelines do not explicitly allow for this circum-
stance.

4.5 Quotes Missing a Time Stamp
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.990872">
Occasionally it happens that an article contains a
quoted utterance, but there is no indication of when
the utterance was made. For example, in the docu-
ment 05 VietnamWar we find the following:
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.981782666666667">

of 265,500 men in our armed forces in Vietnam below
the level that existed when we took office 15 months
ago.”
It is impossible to determine what dates are meant
by the three temporal expressions present in the an-
nouncement. In some cases this information may be
provided in citation footnotes, but this is not always
the case; when this is absent, such expressions can
only be annotated at the level of textual extent and a
localised, context-dependent semantics.

5 Comparing WikiWars to the ACE Data
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.956123">
A comparison of WikiWars with the ACE corpora
reveals some interesting differences.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.986013">
5.1 Vocabulary Differences
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999498723404255">
First, we found differences on the level of the lexical
triggers that signal the presence of temporal expres-
sions. Because of space limitations, we provide here
only the main findings.
Tables 3 and 4 present the 51 most frequent to-
kens, including punctuation, in the ACE 2005 Train-
ing and WikiWars corpus, respectively. Some to-
kens are combined into what we call trigger classes;
for example, all weekday names belong to the class
WEEKDAYNAME.12
We can see that there are many classes that fall
into the top 51 positions for both corpora, e.g. the
names of temporal units (such as month and year).
But there are also clear differences. Month names
are the most frequent class in WikiWars, while they
are not so frequent in ACE. Similarly, year seasons
ranked very highly in WikiWars, but do not figure
in the rankings shown for ACE. On the other hand,
weekday names are quite frequent in the ACE corpus,
but do not occur in the table for WikiWars. This
suggests that these corpora make different use of
temporal expressions: in WikiWars we find many
references to the more distant past, thus the high use
of month names, but ACE documents tend to discuss
12The entries in the table correspond to the lexical and punctu-
ation clues that drive detection of temporal expressions: the high
rank of colons and dashes comes from their use in document
time stamps, which are considered markable by the TIMEX2
guidelines. The T token is a separator that often occurs in times-
tamps, e.g. 2005-01-25T11:08:00; the question mark appears
very often because some of the ACE timestamps are of the form
????-??-??T19:33:00.
temporally local issues, so they are more likely to
refer to days in the weeks preceding and following
the reference date.
Looking at individual tokens, we can see that de-
ictic expressions such as today, tonight, yesterday
and tomorrow are in the top 51 positions for ACE,
but almost never occur in WikiWars: there are only
three instances of today, two of tomorrow and one
of tonight in the corpus, and all of these appear only
in quoted speech. Similarly, ago occurred 113 times
in ACE, but only twice in WikiWars: once in quoted
speech, and once used incorrectly instead of earlier in
a context-dependent expression. Other tokens which
are frequent in ACE but rare in WikiWars are recent,
recently, current and currently.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997152">
5.2 Temporal Discourse Structure
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999426090909091">
A more interesting property that WikiWars exhibits,
and which is noticeably absent from the simpler ACE
data, is what we might think of as a discourse mech-
anism for resetting the temporal focus. This is a
feature of complex texts in general, rather than some-
thing that is specific to Wikipedia as a source. In
these cases, the discourse does not follow a single
global timeline from the beginning to the end of the
document, but is rather divided into subdiscourses
which describe separate chains of events that often
have common temporal starting points. This is typi-
cal in the description of big, often international, con-
flicts, where one can distinguish several theaters of
the war, i.e. the eastern and western theaters.
In most cases the switch to a different ‘part of the
story’ can be determined not only by analysing the
events and their geographic locations, but by recog-
nizing that the first date appearing in the new subdis-
course is generally fully specified. This is, however,
not always the case, as shown in the following exam-
ple extracted from the article 01 WW2:
(7) In northern Serbia, the Red Army, with limited sup-
port from Bulgarian forces, assisted the partisans in a
joint liberation of the capital city of Belgrade on Oc-
tober 20[1944]. A few days later, the Soviets launched
a massive assault against German-occupied Hungary
that lasted until the fall of Budapest in February 1945.
[. . . ]
By the start of July[1944], Commonwealth forces in
Southeast Asia had repelled the Japanese sieges in As-
sam, pushing the Japanese back to the Chindwin River
while the Chinese captured Myitkyina. In China, the
Japanese were having greater successes, having fi-

city of Hengyang by early August[1944]. Soon after,
they [... ] by the end of November[1944] and success-
fully linking up their forces in China and Indochina
by the middle of December[1944].
Clearly, quite sophisticated processing is required to
handle this phenomenon adequately.

6 Automated Processing of WikiWars
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999988615384615">
After we developed the WikiWars corpus, we used it
to evaluate our temporal expression tagger, DANTE,
which had been developed for participation in ACE.
Performance at finding temporal expressions in text is
traditionally reported, for example by (Mani and Wil-
son, 2000; Negri and Marseglia, 2005; Teiss`edre et
al., 2010), in terms of precision, recall and F-measure.
These can, however, be calculated in two ways, le-
nient and strict, corresponding to two tasks: detec-
tion (where a single character overlap between the
gold standard and system annotation counts as a cor-
rect answer) and recognition (where an exact overlap
is required).
Table 5 shows our tagger’s initial performance on
the data. While the lenient F-measure for extent
recognition was comparable to that obtained for the
ACE 2005 Training corpus (0.82 vs 0.78), the recall
was much lower: 0.75 vs 0.87. The difference in
strict results was even larger, where both precision
and recall were lower for WikiWars than for ACE,
resulting in an F-measure of 0.38. When evaluating
also the VAL attribute, the strict F-measure was quite
low for both corpora, but significantly lower for Wiki-
Wars: 0.17 vs 0.33. This illustrates how illusive it
may be to trust the performance of a tagger measured
on a single, possibly biased, data set.
In the light of the results of our comparison in Sec-
tion 5, it is clear that at some of the performance loss
here is simply due to domain differences with respect
to lexical triggers. So, we extended DANTE’s cov-
erage with approximately 20 temporal triggers and
modifiers to include the more common vocabulary
that appeared in the WikiWars data; we also modified
the recognition grammar to reduce the number of
spurious matches and extent errors. These changes
resulted in the improvements shown in Table 6. The
performance on extent recognition improves signif-
icantly for both sets of data, but the gap between
extent recognition and evaluation of the VAL attribute

is much larger on WikiWars. This is most likely be-
cause the strategy of using the document time stamp
for the interpretation of context-dependent expres-
sions does not work at all for WikiWars documents,
whereas it works well for ACE documents, in line
with our earlier comments in regard to the genres of
the documents. This emphasises the need to develop
sophisticated methods for temporal focus tracking if
we are to extend current time-stamping technologies
beyond the relatively simplistic temporal structures
found in currently available corpora.

7 Conclusions and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999561">
We have presented a new corpus based on the his-
torical descriptions of 22 wars sourced from En-
glish Wikipedia, and we have described in detail
the methodology adopted to construct the corpus; the
corpus can be easily extended in the same way. We
annotated temporal expressions in these documents
with TIMEX2 tags, which provide both the textual
extents and the semantics of the expressions in the
context of whole article.
Following an analysis of the differences between
our new corpus and existing data sets, we then pre-
sented the results of automatic processing of the cor-
pus. This demonstrates that differences in the vo-
cabulary used for temporal expressions can be fairly
straightforwardly incorporated in a tagging tool, but
that appropriate processing of temporal structure in
complex documents requires more sophisticated tech-
niques than those required to handle existing corpora.
The WikiWars Corpus provides data that tests these
capabilities.

Unfortunately, there are very few annotated data sets that support the development of techniques for event time-stamping and tracking the progression of time through a narrative. In this paper, we present a new corpus of temporally-rich documents sourced from English Wikipedia, which we have annotated with TIMEX2 tags. The corpus contains around 120000 tokens, and 2600 TIMEX2 expressions, thus comparing favourably in size to other existing corpora used in these areas. We describe the preparation of the corpus, and compare the profile of the data with other existing temporally annotated corpora. We also report the results obtained when we use DANTE, our temporal expression tagger, to process this corpus, and point to where further work is required. The corpus is publicly available for research purposes.</abstract>

Unfortunately, these are the more difficult temporal expressions to handle, and so the ACE corpora may not serve as a good baseline for performance more generally. A second problem is that the ACE corpora appear to contain a significant number of errors in the gold standard annotations, with respect to both the annotated extents and the semantic values assigned, which do not always follow the TIMEX2 guidelines. TimeBank v1.2 is a revised and improved version of TimeBank 1.1 resulting in a number of errors fixed and inconsistencies removed (see (Boguraev et al., 2007)). Unfortunely, this corpus has the same limitations as the ACE corpora in regard to document length and complexity of discourse structure. Further, TimeBank is annotated with TimeML, a scheme more complex than TIMEX2 since it also encompasses the tagging of events and temporal relations. However, TIMEX2 is sufficiently sophisticated for the annotation of most types of temporal expressions, and our review of the literature reveals that the majority of existing temporal taggers output TIMEX2 annotations. Since automatic conversion between TIMEX2 and TimeML annotations is not straightforward, Ti</context>

In Section 4 we comment on some artefacts of Wikipedia articles that impact on the annotation process and the use of this corpus. Then, in Section 5 we analyse the differences between the WikiWars corpus and the widely-used ACE corpora. In Section 6 we report on the performance of our temporal expression tagger on this data set. Finally, in Section 7, we conclude. 2 Related Work At the time of writing, there are two mature, widecoverage schemes for the annotation of temporal information in texts: TIMEX2 (Ferro et al., 2005) and TimeML (Pustejovsky et al., 2003; Boguraev et al., 2005), which is soon to become an ISO standard (Pustejovsky et al., 2010). These schemes were used to annotate corpora that are often used in research on temporal expression recognition and normalisation: the series of corpora used for training and evaluation in the Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) program6 run in 2004, 2005 and 2007, and the TimeBank Corpus. The ACE corpora were prepared for the development and evaluation of systems participating in the ACE program. However, the evaluation corpora have never been publicly released, and</context>

One might consider using the typical durations of events of the corresponding types in such cases, but this solution also has problems (see (Pan et al., 2006)). As is acknowledged in the TIMEX2 guidelines, the treatment of set expressions (i.e. recurring times and durations and frequencies, e.g. twice a month) is underdeveloped. One rule states that set expressions should not be anchored (Ferro et al., 2005, p. 42); this has the consequence that the full semantics of the expression annually since 1955 cannot be provided, and the expression is therefore treated as two separate expressions, annually and 1955. Finally, alternative calendars are not supported, so an expression like February in the pre-revolutionary Russian calendar cannot receive a value unless it appears in an appositive construction which provides an alternative description. Similarly, consider Example (1): (1) On 9 November 1799 (18 Brumaire of the Year VIII) Napoleon Bonaparte staged the coup of 18 Brumaire which installed the C</context>

Clearly, quite sophisticated processing is required to handle this phenomenon adequately. 6 Automated Processing of WikiWars After we developed the WikiWars corpus, we used it to evaluate our temporal expression tagger, DANTE, which had been developed for participation in ACE. Performance at finding temporal expressions in text is traditionally reported, for example by (Mani and Wilson, 2000; Negri and Marseglia, 2005; Teiss`edre et al., 2010), in terms of precision, recall and F-measure. These can, however, be calculated in two ways, lenient and strict, corresponding to two tasks: detection (where a single character overlap between the gold standard and system annotation counts as a correct answer) and recognition (where an exact overlap is required). Table 5 shows our tagger’s initial performance on the data. While the lenient F-measure for extent recognition was comparable to that obtained for the ACE 2005 Training corpus (0.82 vs 0.78), the recall was much lower: 0.75 vs 0.87</context>

The document time stamp is the date and time at which we downloaded the page from Wikipedia to our local repository. The proper content of the article is wrapped in a TEXT tag. This document structure intentionally follows that of the ACE 2005 and 2007 documents, so as to make the processing and evaluation of the WikiWars data highly compatible with the tools used to process the ACE corpora. 3.3 Creating Gold Standard Annotations Having prepared the input SGML documents, we then processed them with the DANTE temporal expression tagger (see Mazur and Dale (2007)). DANTE outputs the original SGML documents augmented with an inline TIMEX2 annotation for each temporal expression found. These output files can be imported to Callisto,7 an annotation tool that supports TIMEX2 annotations. Using a temporal expression tagger as a first-pass annotation tool not only significantly reduces the amount of human annotation effort required (creating a tag from scratch requires a number of clicks in the annotation tool), but also helps to minimize the number of errors that arise from overlooking markable expressions through ‘annotator blindness’.

Finally, in Section 7, we conclude. 2 Related Work At the time of writing, there are two mature, widecoverage schemes for the annotation of temporal information in texts: TIMEX2 (Ferro et al., 2005) and TimeML (Pustejovsky et al., 2003; Boguraev et al., 2005), which is soon to become an ISO standard (Pustejovsky et al., 2010). These schemes were used to annotate corpora that are often used in research on temporal expression recognition and normalisation: the series of corpora used for training and evaluation in the Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) program6 run in 2004, 2005 and 2007, and the TimeBank Corpus. The ACE corpora were prepared for the development and evaluation of systems participating in the ACE program. However, the evaluation corpora have never been publicly released, and thus are currently, for all practical purposes, unavailable. The ACE 2004 corpus contains news data only (broadcast news, newspa</context>
