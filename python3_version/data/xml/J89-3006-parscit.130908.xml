interdisciplinary approach to the analysis of spatial
prepositions. The result is an intriguing, sometimes
incomplete, often speculative account of how language
and space are related. Often the guiding philosophical
maxims are contradicted by assumptions made later in
the book. For example, the ideal meanings of words
often appear to be Platonic objects, something obvi-
ously inconsistent with the tenets in the preface of the
book. Elsewhere, the geometric description functions
seem to embody mental representations, a view not
comfortably condoned by a neo-Heideggerian analysis.
In general, however, the work is an enjoyable and
well-written foray into a very basic subset of language.

There is wide agreement that domain knowledge plays
an important role in natural language processing sys-
tems, and, at the same time, that acquisition of domain
knowledge is an extremely difficult problem. The work
under review offers a rigorous method for knowledge
acquisition in scientific and technical domains, based on
a formal analysis of the texts written by domain experts.
The set of texts in a restricted domain is known as a
sublanguage. The method, which may be termed sub-
language analysis, reveals a formal structure in the
sentences of the texts, sublanguage formulas, which are
similar to the formulas of logic, but with certain exten-
sions (which will be described below).
The sublanguage formulas described by the authors
constitute a form of knowledge representation, and
suggest interesting possibilities for the design of flexible
and expressive databases or knowledge bases. The
strength of the sublanguage approach lies in basing the
knowledge representation on the analysis of actual
texts. The significance of this approach to computa-
tional linguistics is that the initial phase of sublanguage
analysis establishes a direct relationship between sur-
face sentence forms and the semantic representation
(formulas). This mapping serves as a basic design for
text processing algorithms.
A striking feature of the book is that the authors have
carried out a thorough test of their technique on real
data: 14 full-length research articles from the field of
immunology, published in the period 1935-1970. The
formulas obtained and the methods used in producing
them are given in meticulous detail. (The appendices
that give examples of the formulas actually exceed the
length of the narrative portion of the book). The meth-
ods employed are founded on Operator Grammar
(Harris 1982) and are carried out in a general theoretical

framework that portrays the organization of information
in natural language (Harris 1988).
A second feature that makes this book a rarity is that
the analysis of the immunology texts is presented as an
&amp;quot;experiment&amp;quot; with a testable hypothesis: Do the results
(sequences of formulas) obtained by objective analysis
of the immunology articles correlate with known
changes in knowledge of the field during the given
period? The documents were selected for the study by
immunologists (authors T. N. Harris and S. Harris), on
the basis of the historical coverage of this period of
immunological research. Confirmation of the correla-
tion is provided by directly comparing the formulas
(appendices 1 and 2) to the historical discussion given
by the immunologists (Chapter 8), and by the discussion
in the first two sections of Chapter 3.
A key aspect of the sublanguage method is that it is
objective, relying only on structural features of texts
and not ad hoc semantic judgements. This property
insures that the analysis is repeatable, and the authors
demonstrate this fact by performing an independent
analysis of French immunology reports from the same
period (Appendix 2). This second analysis served to
verify that the resulting sublanguage formulas were the
same, regardless of the host language employed by
scientists.
Chapter 1 describes the sublanguage method, a form
of knowledge acquisition that has been applied primar-
ily in text-processing applications (e.g., Sager et al.
1987, Sager 1986, Sager 1978, Hirschman et al. 1976) but
which can be used in a more general way as a means of
unearthing the information structure of a domain
through analysis of texts written by experts. The last
three sections of Chapter 3 define this structure using
the intriguing concept of a &amp;quot;grammar of science.&amp;quot; The
purpose of the method is to establish classes of objects
relevant in the domain, and classes of relations in which
the objects participate. The technique groups different
arguments of sentences (grammatical subjects or ob-
jects) into a class according to their occurrence in the
texts with the same operator (main verb, adjective, or
preposition). Operators are grouped into classes accord-
ing to their occurring with the same classes of argu-
ments. When the analysis is carried out on a sample of
sufficient size, argument classes are found to corre-
spond to domain objects, and operator classes to do-
main relations.
Chapter 2 presents the classes and formulas obtained
for the immunology domain. Formulas are well-formed
expressions made up of an operator class and one or
more argument classes, and correspond to the &amp;quot;events&amp;quot;
of a domain. The argument classes established by the
authors include antibody (A), antigen (G), cell (C),
tissue (T), and body part (B). Operator classes include
inject (J), move (U), and present in (V). Examples of
formulas and the sublanguage sentences they represent
are:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.5233885">
G J B &amp;quot;antigen was injected into the foot-pads of
rabbits&amp;quot;
A V C &amp;quot;antibody is found in lymphocytes&amp;quot;
G U T &amp;quot;antigen arrives by the lymph stream&amp;quot;
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.982911918918919">
The sublanguage method need not be limited to analysis
of texts and can be adapted to incorporate data elicited
directly from domain experts. An exciting prospect
arises in automating portions of the sublanguage analy-
sis, to create tools to assist the linguist in setting up
classes and formulas (e.g., Hirschman et al. 1975, Sager
1975, Grishman et al. 1986), and to interact with domain
experts to gather supplementary information and to
confirm hypotheses made by the tools.
Chapter 4 discusses the informational properties of
the formulas presented in Chapter 2. Sublanguage for-
mulas are a compact notation for knowledge represen-
tation that employ a number of devices to enrich the
basic structure of operator-argument predication. Mod-
ifiers can be placed on operator and argument classes as
superscripts. On arguments, they function as unary
operators or as quantifiers. Modifiers of operators in-
clude negation, quantity, aspect, and direction (of
movement). Subclasses of operator and argument
classes are indicated by subscripts, e.g., cell (C) has
subclasses lymphocyte (C1) and plasma cell (Ci). A rich
set of connectives can join pairs of formulas.
Formulas can be implemented in a fairly straightfor-
ward fashion using Prolog terms, relational database
tables, a semantic net, an object-oriented system, or a
frame-based representation. The choice of implementa-
tion would obviously depend on the complexity of the
sublanguage being processed and on the application that
will make use of the data.
The application of Operator Grammar to sublanguage
offers many exciting possibilities for text processing
systems. Operator Grammar bears many similarities to
Categorial Grammar and shares with combinatorial
logic the avoidance of bound variables (cf. Steedman
1989). Chapter 5 describes the transformations of Op-
erator Grammar used in the analysis phase to para-
phrase variant sentence forms into the canonical formu-
las. This does not imply that the recognition algorithm
must be a traditional, inefficient transformational sys-
tem. In fact, the nature of Operator Grammar encour-
ages the design of algorithms which map free text
directly into a structured representation (Johnson 1987).
The constraints afforded by domain-specific classes are
well known, and algorithms can exploit these con-
straints in a simple way for considerable gains in
efficiency. Chapter 7 gives an informal description of
procedures for rapid recognition of formulas in free
text, and for generation of English sentences from the
formulas.
The book is a unique and remarkable contribution, so
it goes without saying that the methods will be new to
many readers, necessitating a fair amount of unfamiliar
terminology. Terms are well explained and used in a
clear and consistent manner, but the book suffers for

lack of an index. An even greater deficit is the absence
of a comprehensive bibliography. One could receive the
false impression that the book is a first work by the
group (it builds directly on Harris 1982, 1988), or that
they are the only group working in sublanguage (cf. the
collections by Kittredge and Lehrberger (1982) and
Grishman and Kittredge (1986). The absence of refer-
ences to related work in theoretical or computational
linguistics makes the book much less accessible to
readers unfamiliar with the sublanguage approach. This
is truly unfortunate since there are many fruitful corre-
spondences.
In summary, the book offers a clear description of a
much-needed methodology for knowledge acquisition,
and a concise, formulaic representation for science
information. It is highly recommended to anyone devel-
oping text-processing applications in restricted seman-
tic domains.

This collection of 10 papers incorporates proceedings of
the 1985 Lund conference on generalized quantifiers
(GQ). Research on GQ was brought into natural lan-
guage analysis in 1981 by Barwise and Cooper in their
&amp;quot;Generalized quantifiers and natural language&amp;quot;. The
aim was to elevate model-theoretic analysis of NL
phenomena from a sterile exercise in formalization to a
valuable stimulus in development of linguistic theory.
Following Montague&apos;s PTQ, generalized quantifiers
were treated not as the determiner expressions in a
noun phrase (NP), but rather as the entire NP construc-
tion. An NP determiner functions to select a family of
sets from the head noun&apos;s extension as the denotation
for the NP. Interpretation of the noun denotation as a
restriction upon the domain of quantification then al-
lows for uniform semantics for NPs, encompassing
non-logical determiners, (e.g., most, a few), along with
the traditional logical determiners such as every and
some.
The articles in this volume pick up on this theme by
extending the GQ analysis to many of the syntactically
varied forms of NP constructions. At least four distinct
approaches to semantic interpretation are considered,
showing the interest in exploring alternatives to the
possible worlds interpretations of Montague.
Jon Barwise and Robin Cooper each have contribu-
tions that incorporate interpretive structures from situ-
ation semantics in building an alternative to Montague&apos;s
model-theoretic interpretations. Situation semantics of-
fers a more intuitive and simplified domain of individu-
als, properties, and facts for model-theoretic construc-
tion than the intensional domain of functions across
possible worlds. Because the focus is on logical inves-
tigations into the semantic properties of GQs, however,
computational issues concerning implementation of the
proposed semantic models are not explored. Accord-
ingly the volume is directed to those with well-devel-
oped research interests in formal methods, focusing on
modeling a variety of NP phenomena. Other themes
explored within these fine-grained treatments of quan-
