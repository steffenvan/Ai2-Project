SCOPE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99910652631579">
Data Engineering is concerned with the role of data and
knowledge about data in the design, development,
management, and utilization of information systems. As
such, it encompasses traditional aspects of databases,
knowledge bases, and data management in general. The
purpose of this conference is to continue to provide a
forum for the sharing of experience, practice, and theory
of automated data and knowledge management from an
engineering point-of-view. The effectiveness and
productivity of future information systems will depend
critically on improvements in their design, organization,
and management.
We are actively soliciting industrial contributions. We
believe that it is critically important to share practical
experience. We look forwards to reports of experiments,
evaluation, and problems in achieving the objectives of
information systems. Papers which are identified as such
will be processed, scheduled, and published in a distinct
track.

THEORETICAL ASPECTS OF REASONING
ABOUT KNOWLEDGE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.937209714285714">
9-11 March 1986
Asilomer Conference Center, Monterey, CA
While traditionally research in the area of theoretical
aspects of reasoning about knowledge was mainly done
by philosophers, recently it has been shown to be of
great relevance to computer science, especially in such
areas as artificial intelligence, distributed systems, data-
base systems, and cryptography. There has also been
interest in the area among linguists and economists. The
aim of this conference is to bring together researchers
from these various disciplines with the intent of further-
ing our theoretical understanding of reasoning about
knowledge.
Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999574375">
• Semantic models for knowledge and belief
• Resource-bounded knowledge (appropriate for model-
ling reasoners with limited reasoning power and
reasoning about cryptographic protocols)
• Using knowledge to specify and reason about distrib-
uted systems
• Semantic models of knowledge acquisition and learning
• Nonmonotonic reasoning
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.720916333333333">
Please send 8 copies of a detailed abstract not exceeding
10 double-spaced typewritten pages in length (not a full
paper), by 15 September 1985, to the program chair:

<bodyText confidence="0.96754995">
The abstract should include a clear description of the
problem being addressed, comparisons with extant work,
and a section on major original contributions of this
work. The abstract must provide sufficient detail for the
program committee to make a decision. Papers will be
chosen on the basis of scientific merit, originality, and
appropriateness for this conference.
Authors will be notified of acceptance by 1 November
1985. Accepted papers typed on special pages will be due
at the above address by 15 December 1985.
We hope to allow enough time between the talks
during the conference for private discussions and small

The goal of this conference is to explore both the theore-
tical and practical issues of Expert Database Systems.
These systems represent the confluence of R&amp;D activities
in Artificial Intelligence, Logic, and Database Manage-
ment.
Expert Database Systems will play an ever-increasing
role in scientific, governmental, and business applications
by

<listItem confidence="0.999450222222222">
• providing intelligent knowledge-based access to large
shared data bases through novel user interfaces and
natural-language question-answering facilities.
• endowing database systems with reasoning, planning,
and justification capabilities.
• creating knowledge-base management bools and tech-
niques to support the creation, manipulation, indexing,
and evolution of large knowledge bases, and
• integrating AI and QB functional requirements into new

hardware and software environments for the specifica-
tion, prototyping, testing, and debugging of know-

<abstract confidence="0.978392708333333">Asilomer Conference Center, Monterey, CA While traditionally research in the area of theoretical aspects of reasoning about knowledge was mainly done by philosophers, recently it has been shown to be of great relevance to computer science, especially in such areas as artificial intelligence, distributed systems, database systems, and cryptography. There has also been interest in the area among linguists and economists. The aim of this conference is to bring together researchers from these various disciplines with the intent of furthering our theoretical understanding of reasoning about knowledge. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: • Semantic models for knowledge and belief • Resource-bounded knowledge (appropriate for modelling reasoners with limited reasoning power and reasoning about cryptographic protocols) • Using knowledge to specify and reason about distributed systems • Semantic models of knowledge acquisition and learning • Nonmonotonic reasoning Please send 8 copies of a detailed abstract not exceeding 10 double-spaced typewritten pages in length (not a full 15 September 1985, the program chair:</abstract>

Expert Database Systems will play an ever-increasing role in scientific, governmental, and business applications by • providing intelligent knowledge-based access to large shared data bases through novel user interfaces and natural-language question-answering facilities. • endowing database systems with reasoning, planning, and justification capabilities. • creating knowledge-base management bools and techniques to support the creation, manipulation, indexing, and evolution of large knowledge bases, and integrating requirements into new hardware and software environments for the specification, prototyping, testing, and debugging of knowledge-based applications. order to foster the fertilization ideas from Logic, and Data Bases, the conference will be composed of tutorial sessions, paper sessions, and panel discussions. TOPICS OF INTEREST The Program Committee invites original papers (of approximately 5000 words) addressing (but not limited to) the following areas: Theory of Knowledge Bases knowledge representation, knowledge models, recursive data models, object-oriented models, knowledge indexing and transformation) Knowledge Engineering acquisition, maintenance, learning, knowledge-directed dtabase specification and design methodologies, case studies) Knowledge Base Management architectures and langauges, constraint and rule management, metadata management, extensible data dictionaries) Reasoning on Large Data/Knowledge Bases inexact and fuzzy reasoning, non-monotonic reasoning, deductive data bases, logic-based query languages, semantic query optimization, constraint-directed reasoning) Natural Language Interactions question-answering, extended responses, cooperative behavior, explanation and justification) Intelligent Database Interfaces expert system — database communication, knowledge gateways, knowledgeable user agents, browsers, videotex) Knowledge-Based Environments Decision Systems, VLSI design) • Organizational Issues (including technology transfer, of database sysems, knowledge administration, knowledge certification) PAPER SUBMISSION send five (5) copies of papers September 12,</abstract>
