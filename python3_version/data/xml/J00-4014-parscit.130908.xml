This is the official publication of the European Association for Logic,
Language, and Information. The scope of the journal is the logical
and computational foundations of natural, formal, and programming
languages, as well as the different forms of human and mechanized
inference. It covers the logical, linguistic, and information-theoretic
parts of the cognitive sciences. Examples of main subareas are
Intensional Logics including Dynamic Logic; Nonmonotonic Logic and
Belief Revision; Constructive Logics; Complexity Issues in Logic and
Linguistics; Theoretical Problems of Logic Programming and
Resolution; Categorial Grammar and Type Theory; Generalized
Quantification; Information-Oriented Theories of Semantic Structure
like Situation Semantics, Discourse Representation Theory, and
Dynamic Semantics; Connectionist Models of Logical and Linguistic
Structures. The emphasis is on the theoretical aspects of these
areas. The purpose of the journal is to act as a forum for researchers
interested in the theoretical foundations of the above subjects and
their interdisciplinary connections, with an emphasis on general ideas
increasing coherence.

Natural Language and Linguistic Theory provides a forum for the
discussion of theoretical research that pays close attention to natural
language data, so as to provide a channel of communication between
researchers of a variety of points of view. The journal actively seeks
to bridge the gap between descriptive work and work of a highly
theoretical, less empirically oriented nature. In attempting to strike
this balance, a primary goal of the journal is to encourage work which
makes complex language data accessible to those unfamiliar with
the language area being studied, and work which makes complex
theoretical positions more accessible to those working outside the
theoretical framework under review. The journal is structured to
include: - theoretically oriented work on the syntax, semantics, pho-
nology and the lexicon of natural language; - interdisciplinary contri-
butions written with theoretical linguists in mind; - surveys of recent
theoretical developments which facilitate accessibility for a graduate
student readership; - reactions/replies to recent papers; - brief notes,
comments or observations concerning languages or theoretical points;
- letters to the editors; - book reviews of important linguistics titles;
- special topic issues.

Linguistics and Philosophy focuses on issues related to structure and
meaning in natural language, as addressed in the philosophy of
language, linguistic semantics, syntax and related disciplines, in
particular the following areas:
- philosophical theories of meaning and truth, reference, description,
entailment, presupposition, implicatures, context-dependence, and
speech acts;
- linguistic theories of semantic interpretation in relation to syntactic
structure and prosody, of discourse structure, lexcial semantics and
semantic change;
- psycholinguistic theories of semantic interpretation and issues of
the processing and acquisition of natural language, and the relation
of semantic interpretation to other cognitive faculties;
- mathematical and logical properties of natural language and gen-
eral aspects of computational linguistics;
- philosophical questions raised by linguistics as a science: linguis-
tics methodology, properties of linguistic theories and frameworks,
and the relation of linguistics to other fields of inquiry.
Contributions may be in the form of articles, replies, book reviews or
review articles.

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996828">
Manuscripts for Computational Linguistics should be submitted on letter-size paper (8.5 by
11 inches, or A4), double-spaced and single-sided throughout, including footnotes and refer-
ences. The paper should begin with an informative abstract of approximately 150-250 words.
Manuscripts must be written in English. Contact the editor regarding the possibility of electronic
submission.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.715944">
Submissions may be made in any of the following categories:
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.983127333333333">
Papers: This category includes contributions that report significant new research results in com-
putational linguistics or that provide critical reviews of the literature on a particular topic. The
length of a paper depends on its content, but it is suggested that manuscripts be limited to
forty double-spaced.pages. That is the equivalent of thirty journal pages. Each paper is fully
refereed by three or four experts in the field. Manuscripts may also be submitted electroni-
cally; consult http:/ /www.aclweb.org/cl/submit.txt for instructions and pointers to the L TEX
style files. The submission of an article to CL for refereeing means that the author certifies
the manuscript is not copyrighted; nor has it been published or submitted for publication to
another refereed journal. If any version of the paper has appeared, or will appear, in a non-
refereed publication, the details of such publication must be made known to the Editor at
the time of submission. The final version of a paper tentatively accepted for publication must
be accompanied by a Copyright Transfer Agreement signed by all of the authors or, in the
case of a &amp;quot;work for hire,&amp;quot; by the employer. This written transfer is necessary under the 1978
U.S. Copyright law.
Letters to the Editor: This category includes statements of opinion on issues relevant to the
readership. The Editor and the editorial board will evaluate the appropriateness of these con-
tributions for inclusion.
Five copies of papers or three copies of letters should be sent to:

Founded in 1962, the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) is the primary scientific and
professional society for natural language processing research and applications. A European chapter was
established in 1982 and a North American chapter was established in 1999. Besides publishing
Computational Linguistics, the ACL holds international meetings annually as well as sponsoring
frequently-held European and North American chapter meetings where the state-of-the-art in natural
language processing research and development is presented. Special interest groups on the Mathematics
of Language, the Lexicon, Parsing, Generation, Computational Phonology, Multimedia Language
Processing, Very Large Corpora, Natural Language Learning, and Dialogue Processing have been formed;
others are likely to be added.

The scope of the journal is the logical and computational foundations of natural, formal, and programming languages, as well as the different forms of human and mechanized It covers the logical, and information-theoretic parts of the cognitive sciences. Examples of main subareas are Logics including Dynamic Logic; Logic and Belief Revision; Constructive Logics; Complexity Issues in Logic and Linguistics; Theoretical Problems of Logic Programming and Resolution; Categorial Grammar and Type Theory; Generalized Quantification; Information-Oriented Theories of Semantic Structure like Situation Semantics, Discourse Representation Theory, and Dynamic Semantics; Connectionist Models of Logical and Linguistic Structures. The emphasis is on the theoretical aspects of these areas. The purpose of the journal is to act as a forum for researchers interested in the theoretical foundations of the above subjects and interdisciplinary connections, with an emphasis on general increasing coherence. electronically via Subscription Information Volume Kluweru&apos;&apos; ISSN 0925-8531 Subscription Rate: NLG 898.00/USD 408.00, incl.p/h.

<abstract confidence="0.995110631578947">Language and Linguistic Theory a forum for the discussion of theoretical research that pays close attention to natural language data, so as to provide a channel of communication between researchers of a variety of points of view. The journal actively seeks to bridge the gap between descriptive work and work of a highly theoretical, less empirically oriented nature. In attempting to strike this balance, a primary goal of the journal is to encourage work which makes complex language data accessible to those unfamiliar with the language area being studied, and work which makes complex theoretical positions more accessible to those working outside the framework under review. journal is structured to oriented work on the syntax, semantics, phonology and the lexicon of natural language; interdisciplinary contributions written with theoretical linguists in mind; surveys of recent theoretical developments which facilitate accessibility for a graduate student readership; reactions/replies to recent papers; brief notes, comments or observations concerning languages or theoretical points; letters to the editors; book reviews of important linguistics titles; special topic issues.</abstract>
