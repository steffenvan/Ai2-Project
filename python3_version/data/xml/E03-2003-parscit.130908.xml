We give a demonstration of an application of
XRCE&apos;s controlled text authoring system MDA to
biological experiment reports. This work is the
result of a collaboration between XRCE&apos;s Docu-
ment Content Models team, CNRS&apos;s Institut de
Biologie Structurale, and Protein&apos;eXpert, a com-
pany specialized in biotechnology based in
Grenoble. We start with a brief presentation of the
partners involved and their respective goals. We
then give some technical background on the MDA
system. Some novel features of the application are
discussed, in particular how MDA can be used for
integrating the formalization of an experimental

Whereas the human genome sequencing has now been
completed, the formidable task remains of understand-
ing the function of proteins encoded by genes. For this
reason, the production of recombinant proteins has
become an essential aspect of biomedical and biotech-
nology research, that is, exploratory therapeutic re-
search, functional and structural studies. Genes are
coding sequences of DNA molecules and are the tem-
plates from which proteins are synthesized.
Proteins are long linear molecules, which fold into a
well-defined 3-dimensional structure. The structure of
a protein determines its biological function.
The synthesis of proteins from genes is performed by
the complex molecular machinery present in living
cells. Recombinant DNA technology is a set of proce-
dures that allow the production of a protein from a
given organism by another organism, which can be
easily manipulated and cultured. In appropriate condi-
tions these host cells are forced to synthesize the pro-
tein that has been artificially incorporated. Thus, by

transferring a gene of interest into an organism such as
Escherichia coli it is possible to obtain large quantities
of the protein corresponding to the gene (Baneyx 99).
Each protein has a specific behavior and many pa-
rameters can vary (Stevens 2000). Protein&apos;eXpert&apos; has
developed an expertise to determine optimal produc-
tion conditions for recombinant proteins, and it pro-
vides several products and services in this field. One
of these services is called the feasibility study which is
a complete and standardized protein production study
including cloning, expression and solubility tests, cell
fractionation, purification, refolding assay (when nec-
essary), quality control and delivery of 1-10 mg of
soluble proteins. The feasibility study has been de-
signed to optimize protein production protocols and to
give comprehensive information about protein synthe-
sis and purification conditions. By the end of the
study, proteins are delivered with a complete produc-
tion protocol, an expression plasmid, and a solution
proposal if the protein is difficult to express. The fea-
sibility study is carried out by a laboratory technician
under the guidance of a project manager. The techni-
cian performs all the experiments and the manager
writes the final report. This study follows a complex
protocol with several alternatives and potential revi-
sions of previous steps. The experimental part lasts
for about six to ten weeks and the authoring takes
several hours.

gilal doenments. This tool extends conventional syn-
tax-driven SGML or XML editors so that semantic
choices down to the level of words are possible when
authoring the document content. Tn addition, depend-
encies between two distant parts of the document can
be specified in such a way that a change in one part of
the document is reflected in a change in some other
part of the document (long di stance dependencies).
The author&apos;s choices have language-independent
meanings (example in the ease of a drug leaflet:
choosing between a tablet and a syrup), which are
automatically rendered in any of the languages known
to the system, along with their grammatical conse-
quences on the surrounding text. Although the author
is not explicitly following standards, the text produced
by the system is implicitly controlled both:
Syntactically and stylistically: the choice of the stan-
dard terminology for expressing a given notion is un-
der system control, as is the choice between
grammatical variants (such as active/passive sen-
tences) for expressing a given information;
Semantically: the consequences of a choice some-
where are reflected across the whole document, the
author cannot forget to provide some information that
the system requires, dependencies between semantic
parameters (for instance, pregnancy and person gen-
der) can be described.
MDA is an instance of an interactive natural language
generation system. Early systems such as DRAFTER
(Paris et al. 1995), allow the user to specify interac-
tively an internal semantic representation, from which
textual realizations can be produced automatically
through a generation process. More recently, in the
WYSIWYM [What You See Is What You Mean] ap-
proach, (Power and Scott 98) introduced the idea of
using the textual realization itself as the basis for in-
teracting with and updating the internal representa-
tion. A similar approach was adopted in GF
[Grammatical Framework] (Ranta 1999-), a system
which has its roots in interactive mathematical proof
editors, and which provides the core model for MDA.
While GF is based on higher-order constructive type
theory formulation of well-formed semantic represen-
tation and has its own specific grammatical realization
formalism, MDA uses a single formalism (Definite
Clause Grammars) both for the formulation of well-
formed semantic representation and of its textual re-
alization. Both GF and MDA stress the importance of
a formal specification of the well-fbrmedness of the
semantic representation underlying the textual realiza-
tion, while (Power and Scott 98) concentrates on the
formal connections between the semantic representa-
tion and the textual realization.5
The MDA home page6 gives an overview of the capa-
bilities and uses of the system, along with related pa-
pers, as well as a demo in the area of pharmaceutical
documents. 7
2 Aims of the collaboration
Beyond the aspects of standardization and quality
improvements of their reports, which was a primary
requirement, Protein&apos;eXpert was interested in produc-
ing the experiment reports more quickly, since writing
such reports is a time consuming task. Moreover, Pro-
tein&apos;eXpert wanted to allow technicians, who run the
experiments, to author at least some parts of the final
reports themselves. Since MDA guides the author, this
task can be given to people less experienced in writing
documents without risking a decrease in quality, both
at the level of the semantic dependencies to be re-
spected, and at the level of the proper English expres-
sions to be used (French being the commonly used
language at Protein&apos;eXpert).
From XRCE-DCM&apos;s viewpoint, the main objectives
of the collaboration were to confirm the value of our
previously developed methodology for describing the
content and form of technical documents by working
in a completely new domain, as well as to get an un-
derstanding of the potential of MDA-controlled au-
thoring in a previously untouched business area:
experimental protocols and documentation.
While these were the initial goals of the collaboration,
an interesting and unexpected outcome of performing
the concrete work gradually led us to a novel, and
more general, perspective. We noticed the existence
of a strong parallelism between the experimental pro-
tocol (what experimental steps to perform with which
parameters, what decisions to take, how these deci-
sions affect the next steps) and the structure and de-
pendencies in the written report. It was then exciting
to discover that the computational model underlying
MDA was very adapted, not only to the description of
the written report, but also to the fine-grained fOrmal-
ization of the experimental protocol itself In this way,
we have gradually moved to a view of MDA as a con-
venient tool for integrating the formalization of the

cal consequences, in particular for the connection between
these systems and XML-based authoring, as well as for the
definability of such notions as life/death of authoring
choices (Dymetman 2002).

3 The realization
3.1 Design
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999940384615385">
Thc first step of prototype design was to specify thc
structure and content of the experiment reports. With
the help of the grammar writers, the biological experts
produced guidelines, both at the level of semantic con-
tent and of the textual expressions to be used. It was
then followed by DCM formalizing these descriptions
and implementing them in the MDA formalism. De-
tails about this formalism are given in (Dymetman et
al. 2000) and (Brun et al. 2000).
During the formalization and implementation phase,
XRCE used its previously developed methodology of
first modeling the document macro-structure (similar
to a DTD8), then its context-free micro-structure (what
types of content choices are possible at a given point
in the document), and finally the dependencies be-
tween different content elements (example: some ex-
perimental observations lead to certain obligatory
choices concerning the sequel of the experiment).
To perform this formalization/implementation phase, a
biological expert and a grammar developer worked in
tandem for about 40 person-days.
A side-effect benefit of such a collaboration between
biologists and computational linguists is the opportu-
nity it offers to formally analyze the content of a set of
documents to extract domain-specific knowledge: this
decision leads to that result, etc.

3.2 Implementation

<bodyText confidence="0.9998727">
The generic components of the system consist in an
interaction kernel, written in Prolog, connected with a
Java-based GUI. The interaction kernel interprets do-
main-specific grammars (written in a notational vari-
ant of Definite Clause Grammars), which are used
both for the specification of well-formed document
content as well as for the textual realizations of this
content. In the case of the reports being discussed, we
developed grammars for English as well as French
realization, each containing about 380 rules.

The collaboration already led to large-scale English
and French grammars for the interactive authoring of
biological experiments reports.
The formalization process has also been extremely
valuable in inducing Protein&apos;eXpert to be more pre-
cise in the conditions under which a certain textual
expression is produced or a certain justification is
given for a decision made.

Although this formalization process has a cost, this
cost is amply repaid by the consistency and quality of
the documents produced, a result that would be diffi-
cult to obtain if production of the reports where to be
done manually under time-pressure.
Another interesting aspect of the collaboration is that
the document class (reports on the production of re-
combinant proteins) has been designed without being
constrained by a huge corpus of legacy documents to
be accommodated. The MDA methodology is then
useful, not only for producing a controlled authoring
system, but as a systematic and effective way of ap-
proaching the design of new documents where a high
degree of formal precision is needed.
One unforeseen and innovative outcome of the joint
work has been the possibility of formalizing certain
decisions taken by the biological engineers on the
basis of raw experimental data. It is now possible for
the author to input simply certain visual features of an
image (a gel in biological terminology), and the au-
thoring system is able to take some decisions auto-
matically (relative to such things as a choice of
bacterial strain to express the protein) and also to pro-
vide textual justifications for these decisions (see Fig
.3).9

5 Evaluation and Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999857148148148">
The prototype for experimental reports is now under
evaluation in situ at Protein&apos;eXpert. First results indi-
cate that the system clearly improves the quality and
speed of report production. About 30 minutes are
needed for authoring a report using the system, instead
of several hours previously. The in situ evaluation
also made us discover an unexpected side of the MDA
system: its didactical aspect. The system works as a
self-explaining tool since the logical consequences of
a given choice at a given authoring state are immedi-
ately visible to the user. Another interesting feature is
that in a multi-author context (several people contrib-
uting to a given document) MDA can provide a com-
mon working frame, by allowing technicians working
on different facets of the experiment to contribute to
the same report.
Finally, and perhaps most interestingly, we already
mentioned a new perspective opened by the current
work: MDA can be viewed as a tool fbr integrating
formalization of the experimental protocol with its
written documentation.
The main problem identified at this point lies in the
reusability and adaptability of the prototype for new
classes of experiments/documents in the same domain.
This is a crucial point that will be addressed in the
next phases of development, in particular through
work on support tools for the grammar developer.

With of the grammar writers, the biological experts produced guidelines, both at the level of semantic content and of the textual expressions to be used. It was then followed by DCM formalizing these descriptions and implementing them in the MDA formalism. Details about this formalism are given in (Dymetman et al. 2000) and (Brun et al. 2000). During the formalization and implementation phase, XRCE used its previously developed methodology of first modeling the document macro-structure (similar a then its context-free micro-structure (what types of content choices are possible at a given point in the document), and finally the dependencies between different content elements (example: some experimental observations lead to certain obligatory choices concerning the sequel of the experiment). To perform this formalization/implementation phase, a expert and a grammar developer worked about 40 person-days. A side-effect benefit of such a collaboration between biologists and computational linguists is the opportunity it offers to formally analyze the content of a set of documents to extract domain-specific knowledge: this decision leads to that result, etc. 3.2 Implementation The generic components of the system consist in an interaction kernel, written in Prolog, connected with a Java-based GUI. The interaction kernel interprets domain-specific grammars (written in a notational variant of Definite Clause Grammars), which are used both for the specification of well-formed document content as well as for the textual realizations of this content. In the case of the reports being discussed, we developed grammars for English as well as French realization, each containing about 380 rules. 3.3 A Glance at the Interface The following figures show some screenshots of the prototype in use.

The formalization process has also been extremely valuable in inducing Protein&apos;eXpert to be more precise in the conditions under which a certain textual expression is produced or a certain justification is given for a decision made.</abstract>

Although this formalization process has a cost, this cost is amply repaid by the consistency and quality of the documents produced, a result that would be difficult to obtain if production of the reports where to be done manually under time-pressure. Another interesting aspect of the collaboration is that the document class (reports on the production of recombinant proteins) has been designed without being constrained by a huge corpus of legacy documents to be accommodated. The MDA methodology is then useful, not only for producing a controlled authoring system, but as a systematic and effective way of approaching the design of new documents where a high degree of formal precision is needed. One unforeseen and innovative outcome of the joint work has been the possibility of formalizing certain decisions taken by the biological engineers on the basis of raw experimental data. It is now possible for the author to input simply certain visual features of an image (a gel in biological terminology), and the authoring system is able to take some decisions automatically (relative to such things as a choice of strain to express the protein) and also provide textual justifications for these decisions (see Fig 9The author however has the possibility of bypassing these decisions if he does not agree. 5 Evaluation and Conclusion The prototype for experimental reports is now under situ Protein&apos;eXpert. First results indicate that the system clearly improves the quality and speed of report production. About 30 minutes are needed for authoring a report using the system, instead several hours previously. The situ also made us discover an unexpected side of the MDA system: its didactical aspect. The system works as a self-explaining tool since the logical consequences of a given choice at a given authoring state are immediately visible to the user. Another interesting feature is that in a multi-author context (several people contributing to a given document) MDA can provide a common working frame, by allowing technicians working on different facets of the experiment to contribute to the same report. Finally, and perhaps most interestingly, we already mentioned a new perspective opened by the current can be viewed as a tool fbr integrating formalization of the experimental protocol with its written documentation. The main problem identified at this point lies in the reusability and adaptability of the prototype for new classes of experiments/documents in the same domain. This is a crucial point that will be addressed in the next phases of development, in particular through work on support tools for the grammar developer.</abstract>
