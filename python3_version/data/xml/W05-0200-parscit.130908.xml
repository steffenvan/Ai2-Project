Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.962228064516129">
The two main research areas in educational applications, automated evaluation of students free-
responses and intelligent tutoring systems (ITS), have developed fairly autonomously within the NLP
community. We made progress toward bridging this gap in the First Workshop on Building Educational
Applications Using NLP in 2003, where researchers in a wide variety of educational applications met
in Edmonton to share their work and ideas - both in the speech- and text-based communities. Papers
dealt with automated evaluation of essay-length texts and classification of brief responses that students
enter into a tutoring system. Other research that was reported included exploring the value of using
grammar checking within a tutoring system, comparing speech- and text-based tutoring systems, and
automatically generating multiple-choice questions.
There continues to be a significant and fast-growing body of research toward developing educational
applications that incorporate NLP. This has become apparent as, since the First Workshop in 2003,
subsequent workshops have been held by scientists working in this field (InSTIL/ICALL 2004
Symposium on Computer Assisted Learning and the eLearning International Workshop, COLING
2004).
The themes in the 2005 workshop fall into four broad categories. Several papers explore the
automated assessment of written text - a field that is fast becoming mainstream. These papers describe
methods to score essay-length responses, evaluate content-based short answer responses, and identify
plagiarized material. Other papers look at methods for generating assessment questions automatically.
A third major focus is in teaching language skills - both speech and text-based. Finally, two papers
evaluate tools that NLP software developers can use to build educational applications.
We hope that this workshop will continue to facilitate communication between researchers who
work on all types of instructional applications, for K-12, undergraduate, graduate school and
professional or industrial settings. Our goal is to continue to expose the NLP research community
to these technologies with the hope that they may see novel opportunities for use of their tools in
educational applications.
We wish to thank the members of the Program Committee, listed below, for reviewing the large
number of workshop submissions on a very tight schedule. We owe special thanks to Slava Andreyev
for production work on these proceedings (also on a tight schedule!)
