<bodyText confidence="0.991609739130435">
NLP researchers are now building educational applications across a number of areas, including
automated evaluation of student writing and speaking, rich grammatical error detection with an
increasing focus on English language learning, tools to support student reading, and intelligent tutoring.
This workshop is the fifth in a series, specifically related to Building NLP Applications for Education,
that began at NAACL/HLT (2003), and continued at ACL 2005 (Ann Arbor), ACL/HLT 2008
(Columbus), NAACL/HLT 2009 (Boulder), and now at NAACL/HLT 2010 (Los Angeles). Research
in this area continues to grow, and there is ever-increasing interest and practical application which was
evidenced this year, again, by an even larger number of submissions.
We received a record 28 submissions and accepted 13 papers, two of which include demos. All of
the papers are published in these proceedings. Each paper was carefully reviewed by two members of
the Program Committee. We selected reviewers most appropriate for each paper so as to give more
helpful feedback and comments. This workshop offers an opportunity to present and publish work
that is highly relevant to NAACL, but is also highly specialized, and so this workshop is often a more
appropriate venue for such work. While the field is growing, we do recognize that there is a core group
of institutions and researchers who work in this area. That said, we continue to have a very strong
policy to deal with conflicts of interest. First, reviewers were not assigned any papers to evaluate if the
paper had an author from their institution. Second, with respect to the organizing committee, authors
of papers where there was a conflict of interest recused themselves from the discussion.
The papers accepted to this workshop were selected on the basis of several factors: the strength of
the research, the novelty of the approach or domain, and the appropriateness for this workshop. The
final set of papers fall under several main themes which we show below in the order of the workshop
program.
Technology designed to support reading comprehension:
