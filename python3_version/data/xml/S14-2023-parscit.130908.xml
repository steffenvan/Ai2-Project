We report the results we obtained at the sub-
task B (Message Polarity Classification) of Se-
mEval 2014 Task 9. The features used for
representing the messages were basically tri-
grams of characters, trigrams of PoS and a
number of words selected by means of a graph
mining tool. Our approach performed slightly
below the overall average, except when a cor-
pus of tweets with sarcasm was evaluated,
in which we performed quite well obtaining
around 6% above the overall average.

Analyzing polarity in texts is an important task that
may have various applications in real life. There ex-
ist plenty of tasks that may be benefited of computa-
tional procedures that automatically allow to detect
if the author intention has been to express himself as
a positive, negative, neutral or objective manner. Let
us consider, for instance, when a public figure (such
as a politician, celebrity, or business leader) would
like to investigate its reputation in public media. An-
other example would be to calculate the reputation
of a public or private institution. In any case, the
construction of methods for determining the polar-
ity of messages at Internet would help to investigate
their reputation.
In this paper, we present the results we obtained
when we carried out experiments for the subtask B

of Semeval 2014 Task 9, which was named “Mes-
sage Polarity Classification”, and was defined as fol-
low: “Given a message, decide whether the mes-
sage is of positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.
For messages conveying both a positive and nega-
tive sentiment, whichever is the stronger sentiment
should be chosen”.
The remaining of this paper is structured as fol-
lows. In Section 2 we present some related work
found at the literature with respect to the identifica-
tion of emotions in short texts such as twitter. Sec-
tion 3 presents the description of the features and
classification model used in our experiments. The
results obtained together with a discussion of these
results are given in Section 4. Finally, the conclu-
sions are given in Section 5.

There exist a number of works in literature associ-
ated to the automatic identification of emotions in
Twitter, mainly due to the massification of this so-
cial network around the world and the easy manner
we can access to the Tweets from API’s provided by
Twitter itself. Some of these works have focused on
the contribution of some particular features, such as
Part of Speech (PoS) tags, emoticons, etc. on the
aforementioned task. In Agarwal et al. (2011), for
example, the a priori likelihood of each PoS is cal-
culated. They use up to 100 additional features that
include emoticons and a dictionary of positive and
negative words. They have reported a 60% of ac-
curacy in the task. On the other hand, in Mukher-
jee and Bhattacharyya (2012), a strategy based on
discursive relations, such as conectiveness and con-

ditionals, with low number of lexical resources is
proposed. These relations are integrated in classi-
cal models of representation like bag of words with
the aim of improving the accuracy values obtained
in the process of classification. The influence of se-
mantic operators such as modals and negations are
analyzed, in particular, the degree in which they af-
fect the emotion present in a given paragraph or sen-
tence.
One of the major advances obtained in the task
of sentiment analysis has been done in the frame-
work of the SemEval competition. In 2013, several
teams have participated with different approaches
Becker et al. (2013); Han et al. (2013); Chawla et al.
(2013); Balahur and Turchi (2013); Balage Filho
and Pardo (2013); Moreira et al. (2013); Reckman
et al. (2013); Tiantian et al. (2013); Marchand et al.
(2013); Clark and Wicentwoski (2013); Hamdan
et al. (2013); Martinez-C´amara et al. (2013); Lev-
allois (2013). Most of these works have contributed
in the mentioned task by proposing methods, tech-
niques for representing and classifying documents
towards the automatic classification of sentiment in
Tweets.

3 Description of the Presented Approach

We have employed a supervised approach based on
machine learning in which we construct a classifica-
tion model using the following general features ob-
tained from the training corpus.

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9803569">
The description of how we calculated each feature
in order to construct a representation vector for each
message is given as follows.
The probability of each character trigram given
the polarity class, P(trigram|class), was cal-
culated in the training corpus. Thereafter, we
assigned a normalized probability to each sen-
tence polarity by combining the probability of
each character trigram of the sentence, i.e.,
�|message |log [P(trigrami|class)]. Since we
i=1
have four classes (“positive”,“negative”,“neutral”
and “objective”), we have obtained four features for
the final vectorial representation of the message.
We then calculated other four features by per-
forming a similar calculation than the previous one,
but in this case, using the PoS tags of the message.
For this purpose, we used the Twitter NLP and Part-
of-Speech Tagging tool provided by the Carnegie
Mellon University (Owoputi et al., 2013). Since the
PoS tag given by this tool is basically a character,
then the same procedure can be applied.
We performed preliminary experiments by using
these eight features on a trial corpus, and we ob-
served that the results may be improved by select-
ing significant words that may not be discovered
by the statistical techniques used until now. So,
we decided to make use of techniques based on
graph mining for attempting to find those signifi-
cant words. In order to find them, we constructed a
graph representation for each message class (“pos-
itive”,“negative”,“neutral” and “objective”), using
the training corpus. The manner we constructed
those graphs is shown as follows.
Formally, given a graph G = (V, E, L, f) with V
being the non-empty set of vertices, E ⊆ V x V the
edges, L the tag set, and f : E → L, a function
that assigns a tag to a pair of associated vertices.
This graph-based representation attempt to capture
the sequence among the sentence words, so as the
sequence among their PoS tags with the aim of feed-
ing a graph mining tool which may extract relevant
features that may be further used for representing the
texts. Thus, the set V is constructed from the differ-
ent words and PoS of the target document.
In order to demonstrate the way we construct the
graph for each short text, consider the following
message: “ooh i love you for posting this :-)”. The
associated graph representation to this message is
shown in Figure 1.
Once each paragraph is represented by means of
a graph, we apply a data mining algorithm in or-
der to find subgraphs from which we will be able
to find the significant words which will be, in our
case, basically, the nodes of these subgraphs. Sub-
due is a data mining tool widely used in structured
domains. This tool has been used for discovering
structured patterns in texts represented by means of
graphs Olmos et al. (2005). Subdue uses an eval-
uation model named “Minimum encoding”, a tech-

nique derived from the minimum description length
principle Rissanen (1989), in which t he best graph
sub-structures are chosen. The best subgraphs are
those that minimize the number of bits that repre-
sent the graph. In this case, the number of bits is
calculated consi dering the size of the graph adjan-
cency matrix. Thus, the best substructure is the one
that minimizes I(S) + I(G S), where I(S) is the
number of bits required to describe the sub structure
S, and I(G S) is the number of bits required to de-
scribe graph G after it has been compacted by the
substructure S.
By applying this procedure we obtained 597 sig-
nicant negative words, 445 positive words, 616 ob-
jective words and 925 positive words. For the final
representation vector we compiled the union of these
words, obtaining 1915 significant words. Therefore,
the total number of features for each message was
1,923.
We have used the training corpus provided at the
competition (Rosenthal et al., 2014), however, we
removed all those messsages tagged as the class
“objective-OR-neutral”, because all these messages
introduced noise to the classification process. In to-
tal, we constructed 5,217 vectors of message repre-
sentation which fed a support vector machine classi-
fier. We have used the SVM implementation of the
WEKA tool with default parameters for our exper-
iments (Hall et al., 2009). The obtained results are
shown in the next section.

4 Experimental Results

The test corpus was made up short texts (mes-
sages) categorized as: “LiveJournal2014”,
“SMS2013”, “Twitter2013”, “Twitter2014” and
“Twitter2014Sarcasm”. A complete description of
the training and test datasets can be found at the
task description paper (Rosenthal et al., 2014).
In Table 1 we can see the results obtained at the
competition. Our approach performed in almost all
the cases slightly below to the overall average, ex-
cept when we processed the corpus of Twitter with
Sarcasm characteristics. We consider that two main
problems were the cause of this result: 1) The corpus
was very unbalanced and our approaches for allevi-
ating this problem were not sufficient, and 2) From
our particular point of view, there were a high differ-
ence between the vocabulary of the training and the
test corpus, thus, leading the classification model to
fail.

5 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999935785714286">
We have presented an approach for detecting mes-
sage polarity using basically three kind of features:
character trigrams, PoS tags trigrams and significant
words obtained by means of a graph mining tool.
The obtained results show that these features were
not sufficient for detecting the correct polarity of a
given message with high precision. We consider that
the unbalanced characteristic and the fact the vocab-
ulary changed significantly from the training to the
test corpus influenced the results we obtained at the
competition. However, a deep analysis we plan to
do to the datasets evaluated will allow us in the fu-
ture to find more accurate features for the message
polarity detection task.

<abstract confidence="0.997491833333333">We report the results we obtained at the subtask B (Message Polarity Classification) of SemEval 2014 Task 9. The features used for representing the messages were basically trigrams of characters, trigrams of PoS and a number of words selected by means of a graph mining tool. Our approach performed slightly below the overall average, except when a corpus of tweets with sarcasm was evaluated, in which we performed quite well obtaining around 6% above the overall average.</abstract>

Therefore, the total number of features for each message was 1,923. We have used the training corpus provided at the competition (Rosenthal et al., 2014), however, we removed all those messsages tagged as the class “objective-OR-neutral”, because all these messages introduced noise to the classification process. In total, we constructed 5,217 vectors of message representation which fed a support vector machine classifier. We have used the SVM implementation of the WEKA tool with default parameters for our experiments (Hall et al., 2009). The obtained results are shown in the next section. 4 Experimental Results The test corpus was made up short texts (messages) categorized as: “LiveJournal2014”, “SMS2013”, “Twitter2013”, “Twitter2014” and “Twitter2014Sarcasm”. A complete description of the training and test datasets can be found at the task description paper (Rosenthal et al., 2014). In Table 1 we can see the results obtained at the competition.

Subdue is a data mining tool widely used in structured domains. This tool has been used for discovering structured patterns in texts represented by means of graphs Olmos et al. (2005). Subdue uses an evaluation model named “Minimum encoding”, a tech155 Figure 1: Graph based message representation with words and their corresponding PoS tags nique derived from the minimum description length principle Rissanen (1989), in which t he best graph sub-structures are chosen. The best subgraphs are those that minimize the number of bits that represent the graph. In this case, the number of bits is calculated consi dering the size of the graph adjancency matrix. Thus, the best substructure is the one that minimizes I(S) + I(G S), where I(S) is the number of bits required to describe the sub structure S, and I(G S) is the number of bits required to describe graph G after it has been compacted by the substructure S.

By applying this procedure we obtained 597 signicant negative words, 445 positive words, 616 objective words and 925 positive words. For the final representation vector we compiled the union of these words, obtaining 1915 significant words. Therefore, the total number of features for each message was 1,923. We have used the training corpus provided at the competition (Rosenthal et al., 2014), however, we removed all those messsages tagged as the class “objective-OR-neutral”, because all these messages introduced noise to the classification process. In total, we constructed 5,217 vectors of message representation which fed a support vector machine classifier. We have used the SVM implementation of the WEKA tool with default parameters for our experiments (Hall et al., 2009). The obtained results are shown in the next section. 4 Experimental Results The test corpus was made up short texts (messages) categorized as: “LiveJournal2014”, “SMS2013”, “Twitter2013”, “Twitter2014” and “Twi</context>
