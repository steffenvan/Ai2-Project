<bodyText confidence="0.999923789473684">
The growing availability of spoken lan-
guage corpora presents new opportunities
for enriching the methodologies of speech
and language therapy. In this paper, we
present a novel approach for construct-
ing speech motor exercises, based on lin-
guistic knowledge extracted from spoken
language corpora. In our study with the
Dutch Spoken Corpus, syllabic inventories
were obtained by means of automatic syl-
labification of the spoken language data.
Our experimental syllabification method
exhibited a reliable performance, and al-
lowed for the acquisition of syllabic tokens
from the corpus. Consequently, the syl-
labic tokens were integrated in a tool for
clinicians, a result which holds the poten-
tial of contributing to the current state of
speech motor training methodologies.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999979264705882">
Spoken language corpora are often accessed by
linguists, who need to manipulate specifically de-
fined speech stimuli in their experiments. How-
ever, this valuable resource of linguistic informa-
tion has not yet been systematically applied for
the benefit of speech therapy methodologies. This
is not surprising, considering the fact that spoken
language corpora have only appeared relatively re-
cently, and are still not easily accessible outside
the NLP community. Existing applications for
selecting linguistic stimuli, although undoubtedly
useful, are not based on spoken language data,
and are generally not designed for utilization by
speech therapists per se (Aichert et al., 2005). As
a first attempt to bridge this gap, a mechanism is
proposed for utilizing the relevant linguistic in-
formation to the service of clinicians. In coor-
dination with speech pathologists, the domain of
speech motor training was identified as an appro-
priate area of application. The traditional speech
motor programs are based on a rather static inven-
tory of speech items, and clinicians do not have
access to a modular way of selecting speech tar-
gets for training.
Therefore, in this project, we deal with develop-
ing an interactive interface to assist speech thera-
pists with constructing individualized speech mo-
tor practice programs for their patients. The prin-
cipal innovation of the proposed system in re-
gard to existing stimuli selection applications is
twofold: first, the syllabic inventories are derived
from spoken word forms, and second, the selec-
tion interface is integrated within a broader plat-
form for conducting speech motor practice.

2 Principles of speech motor practice

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.959735">
2.1 Speech Motor Disorders
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999985928571428">
Speech motor disorders (SMD) arise from neuro-
logical impairments in the motor systems involved
in speech production. SMD include acquired and
developmental forms of dysarthria and apraxia of
speech. Dysarthria refers to the group of disor-
ders associated with weakness, slowness and in-
ability to coordinate the muscles used to produce
speech (Duffy, 2005). Apraxia of speech (AOS)
is referred to the impaired planning and program-
ming of speech (Ziegler , 2008). Fluency dis-
orders, namely stuttering and cluttering, although
not always classified as SMD, have been exten-
sively studied from the speech motor skill perspec-
tive (Van Lieshout et al., 2001).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998597">
2.2 Speech Motor Training
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997446">
The goal of speech therapy with SMD patients is
establishing and maintaining correct speech mo-
tor routines by means of practice. The process of
learning and maintaining productive speech mo-
tor skills is referred to as speech motor training.

An insightful design of speech motor training ex-
ercises is crucial in order to achieve an optimal
learning process, in terms of efficiency, retention,
and transfer levels (Namasivayam, 2008).
Maas et al. (2008) make the attempt to relate find-
ings from research on non-speech motor learning
principles to the case of speech motor training.
They outline a number of critical factors in the de-
sign of speech motor exercises. These factors in-
clude the training program structure, selection of
speech items, and the nature of the provided feed-
back.
It is now generally agreed that speech motor exer-
cises should involve simplified speech tasks. The
use of non-sense syllable combinations is a gener-
ally accepted method for minimizing the effects of
higher-order linguistic processing levels, with the
idea of tapping as directly as possible to the motor
component of speech production (Smits-Bandstra
et al., 2006) .
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999976">
2.3 Selection of speech items
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99996751724138">
The main considerations in selecting speech items
for a specific patient are functional relevance and
motor complexity. Functional relevance refers
to the specific motor, articulatory or phonetic
deficits, and consequently to the treatment goals
of the patient. For example, producing correct
stress patterns might be a special difficulty for one
patient, while producing consonant clusters might
be challenging for another. Relative motor com-
plexity of speech segments is much less defined in
linguistic terms than, for example, syntactic com-
plexity (Kleinow et al., 2000). Although the part-
whole relationship, which works well for syntactic
constructions, can be applied to syllabic structures
as well (e.g., ’flake’ and ’lake’), it may not be the
most suitable strategy.
However, in an original recent work, Ziegler
presented a non-linear probabilistic model of
the phonetic code, which involves units from a
sub-segmental level up to the level of metrical
feet (Ziegler , 2009). The model is verified on
the basis of accuracy data from a large sample of
apraxic speakers, and thus provides a quantitive
index of a speech segment’s motor complexity.
Taken together, it is evident that the task of se-
lecting sets of speech items for an individualized,
optimal learning process is far from obvious, and
much can be done to assist the clinicians with go-
ing through this step.

3 The role of the syllable
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999988454545454">
The syllable is the primary speech unit used in
studies on speech motor control (Namasivayam,
2008). It is also the basic unit used for con-
structing speech items in current methodologies
of speech motor training (Kent, 2000). Since
the choice of syllabic tokens is assumed to affect
speech motor learning, it would be beneficial to
have access to the syllabic inventory of the spoken
language. Besides the inventory of spoken sylla-
bles, we are interested in the distribution of sylla-
bles across the language.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999565">
3.1 Syllable frequency effects
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999992333333333">
The observation that syllables exhibit an exponen-
tial distribution in English, Dutch and German has
led researchers to infer the existence of a ’men-
tal syllabary’ component in the speech production
model (Schiller et al., 1996). Since this hypothesis
assumes that production of high frequency sylla-
bles relies on highly automated motor gestures, it
bears direct consequences on the utility of speech
motor exercises. In other words, manipulating syl-
lable sets in terms of their relative frequency is ex-
pected to have an effect on the learning process of
new motor gestures. This argument is supported
by a number of empirical findings. In a recent
study, Staiger et al. report that syllable frequency
and syllable structure play a decisive role with re-
spect to articulatory accuracy in the spontaneous
speech production of patients with AOS (Staiger
et al., 2008). Similarly, (Laganaro, 2008) con-
firms a significant effect of syllable frequency on
production accuracy in experiments with speakers
with AOS and speakers with conduction aphasia.

3.2 Implications on motor learning
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999957333333333">
In that view, practicing with high-frequency sylla-
bles could promote a faster transfer of skills to ev-
eryday language, as the most ’required’ motor ges-
tures are being strengthened. On the other hand,
practicing with low-frequency syllables could po-
tentially promote plasticity (or ’stretching’ ) of the
speech motor system, as the learner is required to
assemble motor plans from scratch, similar to the
process of learning to pronounce words in a for-
eign language. In the next section, we describe
our study with the Spoken Dutch Corpus, and il-
lustrate the performed data extraction strategies.

4 A study with the Spoken Dutch Corpus
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999728888888889">
The Corpus Gesproken Nederlands (CGN) is a
large corpus of spoken Dutch1. The CGN con-
tains manually verified phonetic transcriptions of
53,583 spoken forms, sampled from a wide vari-
ety of communication situations. A spoken form
reports the phoneme sequence as it was actually
uttered by the speaker as opposed to the canonical
form, which represents how the same word would
be uttered in principle.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.986595">
4.1 Motivation for accessing spoken forms
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999977">
In contrast to written language corpora, such as
CELEX (Baayenet al., 1996), or even a corpus
like TIMIT (Zue et al., 1996), in which speak-
ers read prepared written material, spontaneous
speech corpora offer an access to an informal, un-
scripted speech on a variety of topics, including
speakers from a range of regional dialects, age and
educational backgrounds.
Spoken language is a dynamic, adaptive, and gen-
erative process. Speakers most often deviate from
the canonical pronunciation, producing segment
reductions, deletions, insertions and assimilations
in spontaneous speech (Mitterer, 2008). The work
of Greenberg provides an in-depth account on the
pronunciation variation in spoken English. A de-
tailed phonetic transcription of the Switchboard
corpus revealed that the spectral properties of
many phonetic elements deviate significantly from
their canonical form (Greenberg, 1999).
In the light of the apparent discrepancy between
the canonical forms and the actual spoken lan-
guage, it becomes apparent that deriving syllabic
inventories from spoken word forms will approxi-
mate the reality of spontaneous speech production
better than relying on canonical representations.
Consequently, it can be argued that clinical ap-
plications will benefit from incorporating speech
items which optimally converge with the ’live’ re-
alization of speech.

4.2 Syllabification of spoken forms
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998186285714286">
The syllabification information available in the
CGN applies only to the canonical forms of words,
and no syllabification of spoken word forms exists.
The methods of automatic syllabification have
been applied and tested exclusively on canonical
word forms (Bartlett, 2007). In order to obtain
the syllabic inventory of spoken language per se,

<footnote confidence="0.863873">

</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.999108714285714">
a preliminary study on automatic syllabification
of spoken word forms has been carried out. Two
methods for dealing with the syllabification task
were proposed, the first based on an n-gram model
defined over sequences of phonemes, and the sec-
ond based on statistics over syllable units. Both
algorithms accept as input a list of possible seg-
mentations of a given phonetic sequence, and re-
turn the one which maximizes the score of the spe-
cific function they implement. The list of possible
segmentations is obtained by exhaustively gener-
ating all possible divisions of the sequence, satis-
fying the condition of keeping exactly one vowel
per segment.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.911675">
4.3 Syllabification Methods
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999991882352941">
The first method is a reimplementation of the work
of (Schmid et al., 2007). The authors describe the
syllabification task as a tagging problem, in which
each phonetic symbol of a word is tagged as ei-
ther a syllable boundary (‘B’) or as a non-syllable
boundary (‘N’). Given a set of possible segmenta-
tions of a given word, the aim is to select the one,
viz. the tag sequence ˆbn1, which is more proba-
ble for the given phoneme sequence pn1, as shown
in equation (1). This probability in equations (3)
is reduced to the joint probability of the two se-
quences: the denominator of equation (2) is in fact
constant for the given list of possible syllabifica-
tions, since they all share the same sequence of
phonemes. Equation (4) is obtained by introduc-
ing a Markovian assumption of order 3 in the way
the phonemes and tags are jointly generated
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.998604333333333">
ˆbn1 = arg max P(bn1|pn1) (1)

b1 i=1 i−�, pi−1
i−�) (4)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999898571428571">
The second syllabification method relies on
statistics over the set of syllables unit and bi-
gram (bisegments) present in the training corpus.
Broadly speaking, given a set of possible segmen-
tations of a given phoneme sequence, the algo-
rithm, selects the one which maximizes the pres-
ence and frequency of its segments.

4.4 Results
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999926904761905">
The first step involved the evaluation of the two
algorithms on syllabification of canonical word
forms. Four corpora comprising three different
languages (English, German, and Dutch) were
evaluated: the CELEX2 corpora (Baayenet al.,
1996) for the three languages, and the Spoken
Dutch Corpus (CGN). All the resources included
manually verified syllabification transcriptions. A
10-fold cross validation on each of the corpora was
performed to evaluate the accuracy of our meth-
ods. The evaluation is presented in terms of per-
centage of correct syllable boundaries2, and per-
centage of correctly syllabified words.
Table 1 summarizes the obtained results. For the
CELEX corpora, both methods produce almost
equally high scores, which are comparable to the
state of the art results reported in (Bartlett, 2007).
For the Spoken Dutch Corpus, both methods
demonstrate quite high scores, with the phoneme-
level method showing an advantage, especially
with respect to correctly syllabified words.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99143">
4.5 Data extraction
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9996985">
The process of evaluating syllabification of spo-
ken word forms is compromised by the fact that
there exists no gold annotation for the pronuncia-
tion data in the corpus. Therefore, the next step
involved applying both methods on the data set
and comparing the two solutions. The results re-
vealed that the two algorithms agree on 94.29%
of syllable boundaries and on 90.22% of whole
word syllabification. Based on the high scores re-
ported for lexical word forms syllabification, an
agreement between both methods most probably
implies a correct solution. The ’disagreement’ set
can be assumed to represent the class of ambigu-
ous cases, which are the most problematic for au-
tomatic syllabification. As an example, consider

of boundaries (one less than the number of vowels) is con-
stant for different segmentations of the same word.
the following pair of possible syllabification, on
which the two methods disagree: ’bEl-kOm-pjut’
vs ’bEl-kOmp-jut’3.
Motivated by the high agreement score, we have
applied the phoneme-based method on the spo-
ken word forms in the CGN, and compiled a syl-
labic inventory. In total, 832,236 syllable tokens
were encountered in the corpus, of them 11,054
unique syllables were extracted and listed. The
frequencies distribution of the extracted syllabary,
as can be seen in Figure 1, exhibits an exponential
curve, a result consistent with earlier findings re-
ported in (Schiller et al., 1996). According to our
statistics, 4% of unique syllable tokens account for
80% of all extracted tokens, and 10% of unique
syllables account for 90% respectively. For each
extracted syllable, we have recorded its structure,
frequency rank, and the articulatory characteristics
of its consonants. Next, we describe the speech
items selection tool for clinicians.

5 An interface for clinicians
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999485">
In order to make the collected linguistic informa-
tion available for clinicians, an interface has been
built which enables clinicians to compose individ-
ual training programs. A training program con-
sists of several training sessions, which in turn
consists of a number of exercises. For each ex-
ercise, a number of syllable sets are selected, ac-
cording to the specific needs of the patient. The
main function of the interface, thus, deals with
selection of customized syllable sets, and is de-
scribed next. The rest of the interface deals with
the different ways in which the syllable sets can
be grouped into exercises, and how exercises are
scheduled between treatment sessions.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99933">
5.1 User-defined syllable sets
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998662375">
The process starts with selecting the number of
syllables in the current set, a number between one
and four. Consequently, the selected number of
’syllable boxes’ appear on the screen. Each box
allows for a separate configuration of one syllable
group. As can be seen in Figure 2, a syllable box
contains a number of menus, and a text grid at the
bottom of the box.
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.963175">

<bodyText confidence="0.999087294117647">
Once the user selects a syllable type, he/she can
further specify each consonant within that syllable
type in terms of voiced/unvoiced segment choice
and manner and place of articulation. For the sake
of simplicity, syllable frequency ranks have been
divided in three rank groups. Alternatively, the
user can bypass this criterion by selecting ’any’.
As the user selects the parameters which define the
desired syllable type, the text grid is continuously
filled with the list of syllables satisfying these cri-
teria, and a counter shows the number of syllables
currently in the grid.
Once the configuration process is accomplished,
the syllables which ’survived’ the selection will
constitute the speech items of the current exercise,
and the user proceeds to select how the syllable
sets should be grouped, scheduled and so on.

6 Final remarks

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.985747">
6.1 Future directions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999936">
A formal usability study is needed in order to
establish the degree of utility and satisfaction with
the interface. One question which demands inves-
tigation is the degrees of choice that the selection
tool should provide. With too many variables
and hinges of choice, the configuration process
for each patient might become complicated and
time consuming. Therefore, a usability study
should provide guidelines for an optimal design
of the interface, so that its utility for clinicians is
maximized.
Furthermore, we plan to integrate the proposed
interface within an computer-based interactive
platform for speech therapy. A seamless integra-
tion of a speech items selection module within
biofeedback games for performing exercises with
these items seems straight forward, as the selected
items can be directly embedded (e.g., as text
symbols or more abstract shapes) in the graphical
environment where the exercises take place.

<abstract confidence="0.9998325">The growing availability of spoken language corpora presents new opportunities for enriching the methodologies of speech and language therapy. In this paper, we present a novel approach for constructing speech motor exercises, based on linguistic knowledge extracted from spoken language corpora. In our study with the Dutch Spoken Corpus, syllabic inventories were obtained by means of automatic syllabification of the spoken language data. Our experimental syllabification method exhibited a reliable performance, and allowed for the acquisition of syllabic tokens from the corpus. Consequently, the syllabic tokens were integrated in a tool for clinicians, a result which holds the potential of contributing to the current state of speech motor training methodologies.</abstract>

However, this valuable resource of linguistic information has not yet been systematically applied for the benefit of speech therapy methodologies. This is not surprising, considering the fact that spoken language corpora have only appeared relatively recently, and are still not easily accessible outside the NLP community. Existing applications for selecting linguistic stimuli, although undoubtedly useful, are not based on spoken language data, and are generally not designed for utilization by speech therapists per se (Aichert et al., 2005). As a first attempt to bridge this gap, a mechanism is proposed for utilizing the relevant linguistic information to the service of clinicians. In coordination with speech pathologists, the domain of speech motor training was identified as an appropriate area of application. The traditional speech motor programs are based on a rather static inventory of speech items, and clinicians do not have access to a modular way of selecting speech targets for training. Therefore, in this project, we deal with developing an interactive interface to assist speech therapists with constructing individualize</context>

Consequently, it can be argued that clinical applications will benefit from incorporating speech items which optimally converge with the ’live’ realization of speech. 4.2 Syllabification of spoken forms The syllabification information available in the CGN applies only to the canonical forms of words, and no syllabification of spoken word forms exists. The methods of automatic syllabification have been applied and tested exclusively on canonical word forms (Bartlett, 2007). In order to obtain the syllabic inventory of spoken language per se, 1(see http://lands.let.kun.nl/cgn/) a preliminary study on automatic syllabification of spoken word forms has been carried out. Two methods for dealing with the syllabification task were proposed, the first based on an n-gram model defined over sequences of phonemes, and the second based on statistics over syllable units. Both algorithms accept as input a list of possible segmentations of a given phonetic sequence, and return the one which maximizes the score of the specific function they implement. The list of possible seg</context>

All the resources included manually verified syllabification transcriptions. A 10-fold cross validation on each of the corpora was performed to evaluate the accuracy of our methods. The evaluation is presented in terms of percentage of correct syllable boundaries2, and percentage of correctly syllabified words. Table 1 summarizes the obtained results. For the CELEX corpora, both methods produce almost equally high scores, which are comparable to the state of the art results reported in (Bartlett, 2007). For the Spoken Dutch Corpus, both methods demonstrate quite high scores, with the phonemelevel method showing an advantage, especially with respect to correctly syllabified words. 4.5 Data extraction The process of evaluating syllabification of spoken word forms is compromised by the fact that there exists no gold annotation for the pronunciation data in the corpus. Therefore, the next step involved applying both methods on the data set and comparing the two solutions. The results revealed that the two algorithms agree on 94.29% of syllable boundaries and on 90.22% of whole word syllabificat</context>

SMD include acquired and developmental forms of dysarthria and apraxia of speech. Dysarthria refers to the group of disorders associated with weakness, slowness and inability to coordinate the muscles used to produce speech (Duffy, 2005). Apraxia of speech (AOS) is referred to the impaired planning and programming of speech (Ziegler , 2008). Fluency disorders, namely stuttering and cluttering, although not always classified as SMD, have been extensively studied from the speech motor skill perspective (Van Lieshout et al., 2001). 2.2 Speech Motor Training The goal of speech therapy with SMD patients is establishing and maintaining correct speech motor routines by means of practice.

Spoken language is a dynamic, adaptive, and generative process. Speakers most often deviate from the canonical pronunciation, producing segment reductions, deletions, insertions and assimilations in spontaneous speech (Mitterer, 2008). The work of Greenberg provides an in-depth account on the pronunciation variation in spoken English. A detailed phonetic transcription of the Switchboard corpus revealed that the spectral properties of many phonetic elements deviate significantly from their canonical form (Greenberg, 1999). In the light of the apparent discrepancy between the canonical forms and the actual spoken language, it becomes apparent that deriving syllabic inventories from spoken word forms will approximate the reality of spontaneous speech production better than relying on canonical representations.

Taken together, it is evident that the task of selecting sets of speech items for an individualized, optimal learning process is far from obvious, and much can be done to assist the clinicians with going through this step. 3 The role of the syllable The syllable is the primary speech unit used in studies on speech motor control (Namasivayam, 2008). It is also the basic unit used for constructing speech items in current methodologies of speech motor training (Kent, 2000). Since the choice of syllabic tokens is assumed to affect speech motor learning, it would be beneficial to have access to the syllabic inventory of the spoken language. Besides the inventory of spoken syllables, we are interested in the distribution of syllables across the language. 3.1 Syllable frequency effects The observation that syllables exhibit an exponential distribution in English, Dutch and German has led researchers to infer the existence of a ’mental syllabary’ component in the speech production model (Schiller et al., 1996).

In other words, manipulating syllable sets in terms of their relative frequency is expected to have an effect on the learning process of new motor gestures. This argument is supported by a number of empirical findings. In a recent study, Staiger et al. report that syllable frequency and syllable structure play a decisive role with respect to articulatory accuracy in the spontaneous speech production of patients with AOS (Staiger et al., 2008). Similarly, (Laganaro, 2008) confirms a significant effect of syllable frequency on production accuracy in experiments with speakers with AOS and speakers with conduction aphasia. 3.2 Implications on motor learning In that view, practicing with high-frequency syllables could promote a faster transfer of skills to everyday language, as the most ’required’ motor gestures are being strengthened. On the other hand, practicing with low-frequency syllables could potentially promote plasticity (or ’stretching’ ) of the speech motor system, as the learner is required to assemble motor plans from scratch, similar to the process o</context>

Motivated by the high agreement score, we have applied the phoneme-based method on the spoken word forms in the CGN, and compiled a syllabic inventory. In total, 832,236 syllable tokens were encountered in the corpus, of them 11,054 unique syllables were extracted and listed. The frequencies distribution of the extracted syllabary, as can be seen in Figure 1, exhibits an exponential curve, a result consistent with earlier findings reported in (Schiller et al., 1996). According to our statistics, 4% of unique syllable tokens account for 80% of all extracted tokens, and 10% of unique syllables account for 90% respectively. For each extracted syllable, we have recorded its structure, frequency rank, and the articulatory characteristics of its consonants. Next, we describe the speech items selection tool for clinicians.
