This book is the fully revised proceedings
of a 2009 one-day workshop on text mining.
Collectively, the ten contributions span sev-
eral major topic areas in text mining, divided
into three parts: keyword extraction, classi-
fication, and clustering; anomaly and trend
detection; and text streams. Generally, the
articles in the first part are technical reports,
and most of those in the second and third
parts are research reviews.
Compared with earlier books on the topic
(Berry 2003; Weiss et al. 2005; Srivastava
and Sahami 2009), Chapter 6, entitled “Sur-
vey of text visualization techniques” is really
new, enlarging text mining to a new field of
scenario discovery. The authors, Andrey A.
Puretskiy, Gregory L. Shutt, and Michael W.
Berry, explore several visual techniques and
describe specific examples of software that
uses them. It’s a demand-oriented study from
the perspective of users’ needs or purposes.
Every technique is concentrated on one cer-
tain user’s purpose. For example, the tag
clouds technique is introduced and shown
to be highly useful in the area of “quick,
complete, and graphical summary of a large
document”‘ (page 108). One of the visual
post-processing tools tailored for specific text
mining packages, named FutureLens, is dis-
cussed in great detail in this chapter.
Not all of the research results in this book
are good, however. For example, in Chap-
ter 1, “Automatic keyword extraction from
individual documents,” by Stuart Rose, Dave
Engel, Nick Cramer, and Wendy Cowley, a
relatively high rate of keyword extraction
precision should be important in information
retrieval (IR) systems, but the results shown
include a precision of only 67%. All in all, this
book is a good presentation of the state-of-
the-art algorithms for text mining from both
the academic and industrial perspectives, and
a useful volume for practitioners and stu-
dents in computer science, natural language
processing, bioinformatics, and engineering
who wish to use text-mining techniques.—
