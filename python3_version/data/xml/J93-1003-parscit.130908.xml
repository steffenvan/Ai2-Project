Much work has been done on the statistical analysis of text. In some cases reported in the lit-
erature, inappropriate statistical methods have been used, and statistical significance of results
have not been addressed. In particular, asymptotic normality assumptions have often been used
unjustifiably, leading to flawed results.
This assumption of normal distribution limits the ability to analyze rare events. Unfortu-
nately rare events do make up a large fraction of real text.
However, more applicable methods based on likelihood ratio tests are available that yield good
results with relatively small samples. These tests can be implemented efficiently, and have been
used for the detection of composite terms and for the determination of domain-specific terms.
In some cases, these measures perform much better than the methods previously used. In cases
where traditional contingency table methods work well, the likelihood ratio tests described here
are nearly identical.
This paper describes the basis of a measure based on likelihood ratios that can be applied to
the analysis of text.

1. Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999842666666667">
There has been a recent trend back towards the statistical analysis of text. This trend
has resulted in a number of researchers doing good work in information retrieval and
natural language processing in general. Unfortunately much of their work has been
characterized by a cavalier approach to the statistical issues raised by the results.
The approaches taken by such researchers can be divided into three rough cate-
gories.

1. Collect enormous volumes of text in order to make straightforward,
statistically based measures work well.
2. Do simple-minded statistical analysis on relatively small volumes of text
and either &apos;correct empirically&apos; for the error or ignore the issue.
3. Perform no statistical analysis whatsoever.

billion words of English text from such diverse sources as internal memos, technical
manuals, and romance novels, and have aligned most of the electronically available
portion of the record of debate in the Canadian parliament (Hansards). Their efforts
have been Augean, and they have been well rewarded by interesting results. The sta-
tistical significance of most of their work is above reproach, but the required volumes
of text are simply impractical in many settings.
The second approach is typified by much of the work of Gale and Church (Gale
and Church this issue, and in press; Church et al. 1989). Many of the results from their
work are entirely usable, and the measures they use work well for the examples given
in their papers. In general, though, their methods lead to problems. For example, mu-
tual information estimates based directly on counts are subject to overestimation when
the counts involved are small, and z-scores substantially overestimate the significance
of rare events.
The third approach is typified by virtually all of the information-retrieval literature.
Even recent and very innovative work such as that using Latent Semantic Indexing
(Dumais et al. 1988) and Pathfinder Networks (Schvaneveldt 1990) has not addressed
the statistical reliability of the internal processing. They do, however, use good statis-
tical methods to analyze the overall effectiveness of their approach.
Even such well-accepted techniques as inverse document frequency weighting of
terms in text retrieval (Salton and McGill 1983) is generally only justified on very
sketchy grounds.
The goal of this paper is to present a practical measure that is motivated by statis-
tical considerations and that can be used in a number of settings. This measure works
reasonably well with both large and small text samples and allows direct comparison
of the significance of rare and common phenomena. This comparison is possible be-
cause the measure described in this paper has better asymptotic behavior than more
traditional measures.
In the following, some sections are composed largely of background material or
mathematical details and can probably be skipped by the reader familiar with statistics
or by the reader in a hurry. The sections that should not be skipped are marked with
**, those with substantial background with *, and detailed derivations are unmarked.
This &apos;good parts&apos; convention should make this paper more useful to the implementer
or reader only wishing to skim the paper.

2. The Assumption of Normality *
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999636928571429">
The assumption that simple functions of the random variables being sampled are
distributed normally or approximately normally underlies many common statistical
tests. This particularly includes Pearson&apos;s x2 test and z-score tests. This assumption is
absolutely valid in many cases. Due to the simplification of the methods involved, it
is entirely justifiable even in marginal cases.
When comparing the rates of occurrence of rare events, the assumptions on which
these tests are based break down because texts are composed largely of such rare
events. For example, simple word counts made on a moderate-sized corpus show
that words that have a frequency of less than one in 50,000 words make up about
20-30% of typical English language news-wire reports. This &apos;rare&apos; quarter of English
includes many of the content-bearing words and nearly all the technical jargon. As an
illustration, the following is a random selection of approximately 0.2% of the words
found at least once but fewer than five times in a sample of a half million words of
Reuters&apos; reports.

The only word in this list that is in the least obscure is poi (a native Hawaiian dish
made from taro root). If we were to sample 50,000 words instead of the half million
used to create the list above, then the expected number of occurrences of any of the
words in this list would be less than one half, well below the point where commonly
used tests should be used.
If such ordinary words are &apos;rare,&apos; any statistical work with texts must deal with
the reality of rare events. It is interesting that while most of the words in running text
are common ones, most of the words in the total vocabulary are rare.
Unfortunately, the foundational assumption of most common statistical analyses
used in computational linguistics is that the events being analyzed are relatively com-
mon. For a sample of 50,000 words from the Reuters&apos; corpus mentioned previously,
none of the words in the table above is common enough to expect such analyses to
work well.

3. The Tradition of Chi-Squared Tests *
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999900272727273">
In text analysis, the statistically based measures that have been used have usually
been based on test statistics that are useful because, given certain assumptions, they
have a known distribution. This distribution is most commonly either the normal or
X2 distribution. These measures are very useful and can be used to accurately assess
significance in a number of different settings. They are based, however, on several
assumptions that do not hold for most textual analyses.
The details of how and why the assumptions behind these measures do not hold
is of interest primarily to the statistician, but the result is of interest to the statistical
consumer (in our case, somebody interested in counting words). More applicable tech-
niques are important in textual analysis. The next section describes one such technique;
implementation of this technique is described in later sections.

4. Binomial Distributions for Text Analysis **
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.988712962962963">
Binomial distributions arise commonly in statistical analysis when the data to be ana-
lyzed are derived by counting the number of positive outcomes of repeated identical
and independent experiments. Flipping a coin is the prototypical experiment of this
sort.
The task of counting words can be cast into the form of a repeated sequence
of such binary trials comparing each word in a text with the word being counted.
These comparisons can be viewed as a sequence of binary experiments similar to coin
flipping. In text, each comparison is clearly not independent of all others, but the
dependency falls off rapidly with distance. Another assumption that works relatively
well in practice is that the probability of seeing a particular word does not vary. Of
course, this is not really true, since changes in topic may cause this frequency to
vary. Indeed it is the mild failure of this assumption that makes shallow information
retrieval techniques possible.
To the extent that these assumptions of independence and stationarity are valid,
we can switch to an abstract discourse concerning Bernoulli trials instead of words in
text, and a number of standard results can be used. A Bernoulli trial is the statistical
idealization of a coin flip in which there is a fixed probability of a successful outcome
that does not vary from flip to flip.
In particular, if the actual probability that the next word matches a prototype is p,
then the number of matches generated in the next n words is a random variable (K)
with binomial distribution
n )k
whose mean is np and whose variance is np(1 âp). If np(1 âp) &gt; 5, then the distribution
of this variable will be approximately normal, and as np(1 â p) increases beyond that
point, the distribution becomes more and more like a normal distribution. This can be
seen in Figure 1 above, where the binomial distribution (dashed lines) is plotted along
with the approximating normal distributions (solid lines) for np set to 5, 10, and 20,

with n fixed at 100. Larger values of n with np held constant give curves that are not
visibly different from those shown. For these cases, npr--,- np(1 â p).
This agreement between the binomial and normal distributions is exactly what
makes test statistics based on assumptions of normality so useful in the analysis of
experiments based on counting. In the case of the binomial distribution, normality
assumptions are generally considered to hold well enough when np(1 â p) &gt; 5.
The situation is different when np(1âp) is less than 5, and is dramatically different
when np(1 â p) is less than 1. First, it makes much less sense to approximate a discrete
distribution such as the binomial with a continuous distribution such as the normal.
Second, the probabilities computed using the normal approximation are less and less
accurate.
Table 1 shows the probability that one or more matches are found in 100 words
of text as computed using the binomial and normal distributions for np = 0.001,
np = 0.01, np = 0.1, and np = 1 where n = 100. Most words are sufficiently rare so
that even for samples of text where n is as large as several thousand, np will be at
the bottom of this range. Short phrases are so numerous that np &lt; 1 for almost all
phrases even when n is as large as several million.
Table 1 shows that for rare events, the normal distribution does not even approx-
imate the binomial distribution. In fact, for np = 0.1 and n = 100, using the normal
distribution overestimates the significance of one or more occurrences by a factor of
40, while for np = 0.01, using the normal distribution overestimates the significance by
about 4 x 1020. When n increases beyond 100, the numbers in the table do not change
significantly.
If this overestimation were constant, then the estimates using normal distributions
could be corrected and would still be useful, but the fact that the errors are not constant
means that methods dependent on the normal approximation should not be used to
analyze Bernoulli trials where the probability of positive outcome is very small. Yet,
in many real analyses of text, comparing cases where np --= 0.001 with cases where
np &gt; 1 is a common problem.

There is another class of tests that do not depend so critically on assumptions of
normality. Instead they use the asymptotic distribution of the generalized likelihood
ratio. For text analysis and similar problems, the use of likelihood ratios leads to
very much improved statistical results. The practical effect of this improvement is that
statistical textual analysis can be done effectively with very much smaller volumes of
text than is necessary for conventional tests based on assumed normal distributions,

5.1 Parameter Spaces and Likelihood Functions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999989636363636">
Likelihood ratio tests are based on the idea that statistical hypotheses can be said
to specify subspaces of the space described by the unknown parameters of the sta-
tistical model being used. These tests assume that the model is known, but that the
parameters of the model are unknown. Such a test is called parametric. Other tests are
available that make no assumptions about the underlying model at all; they are called
distribution-free. Only one particular parametric test is described here. More informa-
tion on parametric and distribution-free tests is available in Bradley (1968) and Mood,
Graybill, and Boes (1974).
The probability that a given experimental outcome described by k1,...,kn will be
observed for a given model described by a number of parameters p1,132,... is called
the likelihood function for the model and is written as
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.858237">
H(pi,p2, â¢ ..;k1,. â¢ .,km)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999937714285714">
where all arguments of H left of the semicolon are model parameters, and all argu-
ments right of the semicolon are observed values. In the continuous case, the proba-
bility is replaced by a probability density. With binomial and multinomials, we only
deal with the discrete case.
For repeated Bernoulli trials, m =- 2 because we observe both the number of trials
and the number of positive outcomes and there is only one p. The explicit form for
the likelihood function is
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.982215">
H(p;n,k) =- pk(1 â p)nâk (n
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.99990575">
The parameter space is the set of all values for p and the hypothesis that p -= po
is a single point. For notational brevity the model parameters can be collected into a
single parameter, as can the observed values. Then the likelihood function is written
as
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.425751">
H(w;k)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999513">
where w is considered to be a point in the parameter space Q, and k a point in the
space of observations K. Particular hypotheses or observations are represented by
subscripting or K respectively.
More information about likelihood ratio tests can be found in texts on theoretical
statistics (Mood et al. 1974).

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999852">
5.2 The Likelihood Ratio
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999979">
The likelihood ratio for a hypothesis is the ratio of the maximum value of the likelihood
function over the subspace represented by the hypothesis to the maximum value of
the likelihood function over the entire parameter space. That is,

The particularly important feature of likelihood ratios is that the quantity â2 log A
is asymptotically x2 distributed with degrees of freedom equal to the difference in
dimension between Q and Q0. Importantly, this asymptote is approached very quickly
in the case of binomial and multinomial distributions.

as in the multinomial case above and
Interestingly, this expression is exactly the test statistic for Pearson&apos;s X2 test, although
the form shown is not quite the customary one. Figure 2 shows the reasonably good
agreement between this expression and the exact binomial log-likelihood ratio derived
earlier where p = 0.1 and n1 = n2 = 1000 for various values of ki and k2.
Figure 3, on the other hand, shows the divergence between Pearson&apos;s statistic and
the log-likelihood ratio when p = 0.01, n1 = 100, and n2 = 10000. Note the large
change of scale on the vertical axis. The pronounced disparity occurs when ki is larger
than the value expected based on the observed value of k2. The case where n1 &lt; n2
and Ln &gt;1 2 -n 2 is exactly the case of most interest in many text analyses.
Tile convergence of the log of the likelihood ratio to the asymptotic distribution is
demonstrated dramatically in Figure 4. In this figure, the straighter line was computed
using a symbolic algebra package and represents the idealized one degree of freedom
cumulative X2 distribution. The rougher curve was computed by a numerical experi-
ment in which p = 0.01, n1 = 100, and n2 = 10000, which corresponds to the situation
in Figure 3. The close agreement shows that the likelihood ratio measure produces
accurate results over six decades of significance even in the range where the normal
X2 measure diverges radically from the ideal.

finding pairs of words that occurred next to each other with a significantly higher
frequency than would be expected, based on the word frequencies alone. The text was
31,777 words of financial text largely describing market conditions for 1986 and 1987.
The results of such a bigram analysis should highlight collocations common in
English as well as collocations peculiar to the financial nature of the analyzed text.
As will be seen, the ranking based on likelihood ratio tests does exactly this. Similar
comparisons made between a large corpus of general text and a domain-specific text
can be used to produce lists consisting only of words and bigrams characteristic of
the domain-specific texts.
This comparison was done by creating a contingency table that contained the
following counts of each bigram that appeared in the text:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.949489">
k(AB) k(-, A B)
k(A â B) k(â A -, B)

<bodyText confidence="0.998856545454545">
where the A B represents the bigram in which the first word is not word A and the
second is word B.
If the words A and B occur independently, then we would expect p(AB) -= p(A)p(B)
where p(AB) is the probability of A and B occurring in sequence, p(A) is the probability
of A appearing in the first position, and p(B) is the probability of B appearing in the
second position. We can cast this into the mold of our earlier binomial analysis by
phrasing the null hypothesis that A and B are independent as p(A I B) = p(A H B) =

to see if the distribution of A given that B is present (the first row of the table) is
the same as the distribution of A given that B is not present (the second row of the

independent; we know that they are generally not independent in text. Instead we just
want to use the test statistic as a measure that will help highlight particular As and
Bs that are highly associated in text.
These counts were analyzed using the test for binomials described earlier, and the
50 most significant are tabulated in Table 2. This table contains the most significant
200 bigrams and is reverse sorted by the first column, which contains the quantity
â2 log A. Other columns contain the four counts from the contingency table described
above, and the bigram itself.
Examination of the table shows that there is good correlation with intuitive feelings
about how natural the bigrams in the table actually are. This is in distinct contrast with
Table 3, which contains the same data except that the first column is computed using
Pearson&apos;s X2 test statistic. The overestimate of the significance of items that occur only
a few times is dramatic. In fact, the entire first portion of the table is dominated by
bigrams rare enough to occur only once in the current sample of text. The misspelling
in the bigram &apos;sees posibilities&apos; is in the original text.
Out of 2693 bigrams analyzed, 2682 of them fall outside the scope of applicability
of the normal X2 test. The 11 bigrams that were suitable for analysis with the X2 test
are listed in Table 4. It is notable that all of these bigrams contain the word the, which
is the most common word in English.

7. Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999972210526316">
Statistics based on the assumption of normal distribution are invalid in most cases
of statistical text analysis unless either enormous corpora are used, or the analysis is
restricted to only the very most common words (that is, the ones least likely to be of
interest). This fact is typically ignored in much of the work in this field. Using such
invalid methods may seriously overestimate the significance of relatively rare events.
Parametric statistical analysis based on the binomial or multinomial distribution ex-
tends the applicability of statistical methods to much smaller texts than models using
normal distributions and shows good promise in early applications of the method.
Further work is needed to develop software tools to allow the straightforward
analysis of texts using these methods. Some of these tools have been developed and
will be distributed by the Consortium for Lexical Research. For further information
on this software, contact the author or the Consortium via e-mail at ted@nmsu.edu or
lexical@nmsu.edu.
In addition, there are a wide variety of distribution free methods that may avoid
even the assumption that text can be modeled by multinomial distributions. Measures
based on Fischer&apos;s exact method may prove even more satisfactory than the likelihood
ratio measures described in this paper. Also, using the Poisson distribution instead of
the multinomial as the limiting distribution for the distribution of counts may provide
some benefits. All of these possibilities should be tested.

<abstract confidence="0.968976">Much work has been done on the statistical analysis of text. In some cases reported in the literature, inappropriate statistical methods have been used, and statistical significance of results have not been addressed. In particular, asymptotic normality assumptions have often been used unjustifiably, leading to flawed results. This assumption of normal distribution limits the ability to analyze rare events. Unfortunately rare events do make up a large fraction of real text. However, more applicable methods based on likelihood ratio tests are available that yield good results with relatively small samples. These tests can be implemented efficiently, and have been used for the detection of composite terms and for the determination of domain-specific terms. In some cases, these measures perform much better than the methods previously used. In cases where traditional contingency table methods work well, the likelihood ratio tests described here are nearly identical.</abstract>

Other tests are available that make no assumptions about the underlying model at all; they are called distribution-free. Only one particular parametric test is described here.

For notational brevity the model parameters can be collected into a single parameter, as can the observed values. Then the likelihood function is written as H(w;k) where w is considered to be a point in the parameter space Q, and k a point in the space of observations K. Particular hypotheses or observations are represented by subscripting or K respectively. More information about likelihood ratio tests can be found in texts on theoretical statistics (Mood et al. 1974). 5.2 The Likelihood Ratio The likelihood ratio for a hypothesis is the ratio of the maximum value of the likelihood function over the subspace represented by the hypothesis to the maximum value of the likelihood function over the entire parameter space. That is, A = max, E H(w;k) max, E H(w;k) where Q is the entire parameter space and Q0 is the particular hypothesis being tested. The particularly important feature of likelihood ratios is that the quantity â2 log A is asymptotically x2 distributed with degrees of freedom equal to the difference in dimension between Q and Q0.

The third approach is typified by virtually all of the information-retrieval literature. Even recent and very innovative work such as that using Latent Semantic Indexing (Dumais et al. 1988) and Pathfinder Networks (Schvaneveldt 1990) has not addressed the statistical reliability of the internal processing. They do, however, use good statistical methods to analyze the overall effectiveness of their approach. Even such well-accepted techniques as inverse document frequency weighting of terms in text retrieval (Salton and McGill 1983) is generally only justified on very sketchy grounds. The goal of this paper is to present a practical measure that is motivated by statistical considerations and that can be used in a number of settings. This measure works reasonably well with both large and small text samples and allows direct comparison of the significance of rare and common phenomena. This comparison is possible because the measure described in this paper has better asymptotic behavior than more traditional measures. In the following, some sections are composed largely of background material or mathematical details and can</context>
