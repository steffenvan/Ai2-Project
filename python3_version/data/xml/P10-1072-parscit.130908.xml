We present a game-theoretic model of bar-
gaining over a metaphor in the context of
political communication, find its equilib-
rium, and use it to rationalize observed
linguistic behavior. We argue that game
theory is well suited for modeling dis-
course as a dynamic resulting from a num-
ber of conflicting pressures, and suggest
applications of interest to computational

A 13 Dec 1992 article in The Times starts thus:
The European train chugged out of the station
last night; for most of the day it looked as if it
might be stalled there for some time. It managed
to pull away at around 10:30 pm only after the
Spanish prime minister, Felipe Gonzalez, forced
the passengers in the first class carriages into a
last minute whip round to sweeten the trip for the
European Community’s poor four: Spain, Portu-
gal, Greece and Ireland.
The fat controller, Helmut Kohl, beamed with
satisfaction as the deal was done. The elegantly-
suited Francois Mitterrand was equally satisfied.
But nobody was as pleased as John Major, sta-
tionmaster for the UK presidency, for whom the
agreement marked a scarce high point in a bat-
tered premiership.
The departure had actually been delayed by
seven months by Danes on the line. Just when
that problem was solved, there was the volu-
ble outbreak, orchestrated by Spain, from the
poor four passengers demanding that they should
travel free and be given spending money, too.
The coupling of the carriages may not be reli-
ably secure but the pan-European express is in
motion. That few seem to agree the destination
suggests that future arguments are inevitable at
every set of points. Next stop: Copenhagen.
Apart from an entertaining read, the extended
metaphor provides an elaborate conceptual cor-
respondence between a familiar domain of train
journeys and the unfolding process of European
integration. Carriages are likened to nation states;
passengers to their peoples; treaties to stations;
politicians to responsible rail company employees.
In a compact form, the metaphor gives expres-
sion to both the small and the large scale of the
process. It provides for the recent history: Den-
mark’s failure to ratify the 1992 Maastricht treaty
until opt-outs were negotiated later that year is
compared to dissenters sabotaging the journey by
laying on the tracks (Danes on the line); nego-
tiations over the Cohesion Fund that would pro-
vide less developed regions with financial aid to
help them comply with convergence criteria are
likened to second class carriages with poor pas-
sengers for whom the journey had to be subsi-
dized. At a more general level, the European in-
tegration is a purposeful movement towards some
destination according to a worked out plan, get-
ting safely through negotiation and implementa-
tion from one treaty to another, as a train moving
on its rails through subsequent stations, with each
nation being separate yet tied with everyone else.
Numerous inferences regarding speed, timetables,
stations, passengers, different classes of tickets,
temporary obstacles on the tracks, and so on can
be made by the reader based on the knowledge of
train journeys, giving him or her a feeling of an en-
hanced understanding1 of the highly complex pro-
cess of European integration.
So apt was the metaphor that political fights
were waged over its details (Musolff, 2000). Wor-
ries about destination were given an eloquent ex-
pression by Margaret Thatcher (Sunday Times, 20
Sept 1992):
She warned EC leaders to stop their endless
round of summits and take notice of their own
people. “There is a fear that the European train
will thunder forward, laden with its customary
cargo of gravy, towards a destination neither
wished for nor understood by electorates. But
the train can be stopped,” she said.

The metaphor proved flexible enough for fur-
ther elaboration. John Major, a Conservative PM
of Britain, spoke on June 1st, 1994 about his vi-
sion of the decision making at the EU level, say-
ing that he had never believed that Europe must
act as one on every issue, and advocating “a sensi-
ble new approach, varying when it needs to, multi-
track, multi-speed, multi-layered.” He attempted
to turn a largely negative Conservative take on the
European train (see Thatcher above) into a tenable
positive vision — each nation-carriage is now pre-
sumably a rather autonomous entity, waiting on a
side track for the right locomotive, in a huge yet
smoothly operating railroad system.
Major’s political opponents offered their
counter-frames. In both cases, the imagery of
a large transportation system was taken up, yet
turned around to suggest that “multi, for every-
one” amounts to Britain being in “the slow lane,”
and a different image was suggested that makes
the negative evaluation of Britain’s opt-outs
more poignant — a football metaphor, where
relegation to the second division is a sign of a
weak performance, and a school metaphor, where
Britain is portrayed as an under-achiever:
John Cunningham, Labour He has admitted that his Go-
vernment would let Britain fall behind in Europe. He
is apparently willing to offer voluntary relegation to the
second division in Europe, and he isn’t even prepared to
put up a fight. I believe that in any two-speed Europe,
Britain must be up with those in the fast lane. Clearly
Mr Major does not.
Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat Are you really saying
that the best that Britain can hope for under your leader-
ship is ... the slow lane of a two-speed Europe? Most
people in this country will want to aim higher, and will
reject your view of a ‘drop-out’ Britain.
The pro-European camp rallied around the
“Britain in the slow lane” version as a critical
stance towards the government’s European policy.
Of the alternative metaphors, the school metaphor
has some traction in the Euro discourse, where the
European (mainly German) financial officers are
compared to school authorities, and governments
struggling to meet the strict convergence criteria to
enter the Euro are compared to pupils that barely
make the grade with Britain as a ‘drop-out’ who
gave up even trying (Musolff, 2000).
The fact that European policy is being commu-
nicated and negotiated via a metaphor is not sur-
prising; after all, “there is always someone willing
to help us think by providing us with a metaphor
that accords with HIS views.”2 From the point of
view of the dynamics of political discourse, the
puzzle is rather the apparent tendency of politi-
cians to be compelled by the rival’s metaphori-
cal framework. Thatcher tries to turn the train
metaphor used by the pro-EU camp around. Yet,
assuming metaphors are matters of choice, why
should Thatcher feel constrained by her rival’s
choice, why doesn’t she ignore it and merely sug-
gest a new metaphor of her own design? As the
evidence above suggests, this is not Thatcher’s
idiosyncrasy, as Major and his rivals acted simi-
larly. Can this dynamic be explained?
In this article, we use the explanatory frame-
work of game theory, seeking to rationalize the ob-
served behavior by designing a game that would
produce, at equilibrium, the observed dynamics.
Specifically, we formalize the notion that the price
of “locking” the public into a metaphorical frame
of reference is that a politician is coerced into stay-
ing within the metaphor as well, even if he or she
is at the receiving end of a rival’s rhetorical move.
Since the use of game theory is not common in
computational linguistics, we first explain its main
attributes, justify our decision to make use of it,
and draw connections to research questions that
can benefit from its application (section 2). Next,
we design the game of bargaining over a metaphor,
and find its equilibrium (section 3), followed by a
discussion (section 4).

2 Game-Theoretic models
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9995485">
The basic construct is that of a game, that is,
a model of participants in an interaction (called
“players”), their goals (or “utilities”) and allow-
able moves. Different moves yield different util-
ities for a player; it is assumed that each player
would pick a strategy that maximizes her utility.
The observable is the actual sequence of moves;
importantly, these are assumed to be the optimal
outcome (an equilibrium) of the relevant game. A
popular notion of equilibrium is Nash equilibrium
(Nash, 1950). For extensive form games (the type
employed in this paper), the notion of subgame
perfect equilibirum is typically used, denoting a
Nash equilibrium that would remain such if the
players start from any stage of the evolving game
(Selten (1975; 1965)).
The task of a game theorist is to reverse-
engineer the model for which the observed se-

quence of actions is an equilibrium. The resulting
model is thereby able to rationalize the observed
behavior as a naturally emerging dynamics be-
tween agents maximizing certain utility functions.
In economics, game-theoretic models are used to
explain price change, organization of production,
and market failures (Mas-Colell et al., 1995; von
Neumann and Morgenstern, 1944); in biology —
the operation of natural selection processes (Ax-
elrod and Hamilton, 1981; Maynard Smith and
Price, 1973); in social sciences — political institu-
tions, collective action, and conflict (Greif, 2006;
Schelling, 1997; North, 1990). In recent appli-
cations in linguistics, pragmatic phenoma such as
implicatures are rendered as an equilibrium out-
come of a communication game (Jager and Ebert,
2008; van Rooij, 2008; Ross, 2007; van Rooij and
Schulz, 2004; Parikh, 2001; Glazer and Rubin-
stein, 2001; Dekker and van Rooy, 2000).
Computing equilibria is simple for some games
and quite evolved for others. For example, com-
puting the equilibrium of a zero-sum game is equi-
valent to LP optimization (Luce and Raiffa, 1957);
an equilibrium of general bimatrix games can be
found using a pivoting algorithm (von Stengel,
2007; Lemke and Howson, 1964). Interesting
connections have been pointed out between game
theory and machine learning: Freund and Schapire
(1996) present both online learning and boosting
as a repeated zero-sum game; Shalev-Shwartz and
Singer (2006) show similarly that loss minimiza-
tion in online learning is akin to an equilibrium
path in a repeated game.
While game theoretic models are not much uti-
lized in computational linguistics, they are quite
attractive to tackle some of the problems com-
putational linguists are interested in. For exam-
ple, generation of referring expressions (Paraboni
et al., 2007; Gardent et al., 2004; Siddharthan
and Copestake, 2004; Dale and Reiter, 1995) can
be rendered as a communication game with util-
ity functions that reflect pressures to use shorter
expressions while avoiding excessive ambiguity
(Clark and Parikh, 2007), with corpora anno-
tated for entity mentions informing the design
of a model. Generally, computational linguis-
tics research produces algorithms to detect enti-
ties of various kinds, be it topics, named entities,
metaphors, moves in a multi-party conversations,
or syntactic constructions in large corpora; such
primary data can be used to trace developments
not only in chronological terms (Gruhl et al., 2004;
Allan, 2002), but in strategic terms, i.e. in terms
that reflect agendas of the actors, such as political
agendas in legislatures (Quinn et al., 2006) or ac-
tivist forums (Greene and Resnik, 2009), research
agendas in group meetings (Morgan et al., 2001),
or social agendas in speed-dates (Jurafsky et al.,
2009). Game theoretical models are well suited
for modeling dynamics that emerge under multi-
ple, possibly conflicting constraints, as we exem-
plify in this article.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999354057142857">
We extend Rubinstein (1982) model of negotia-
tion through offers and counter-offers between two
players with a public benefit constraint.
The model consists of (1) two players repre-
senting the opposing sides, (2) a set of frames
XCR&apos; compact and convex, (3) preference re-
lations described by continuous utility func-
tions U1, U2:X—*R+, (4) a sequence of frames
X0CX1 ...C2X that can be suggested to the pub-
lic, and (5) a sequence of public preferences over
frames in Xt for t=0, 1, 2,... described by a public
utility function UP .
The game proceeds as follows. Initially the
frame is F0=X. In odd rounds player 1 appeals to
the public with a frame A1t EXt�Ft , Xt�Ft ={AEXt �
ACFt}, player 2 counters with a frame A2t EXt�Ft .
The public chooses one of the frames based on
UP (AZt) with ties broken in 1’s favor. The ac-
cepted frame becomes the current frame for the
next round Ft+1. In even rounds the parts of play-
ers 1 and 2 are reversed.
A finite sequence F0, ... , Ft_1 gives the his-
tory of the bargaining process up to t. A
strategy QZ of player i is a function specify-
ing for any history h={F0, ... , Ft_1} the move
player i makes at time t, namely the frame AZt
she chooses to address the public. A sequence
F0, F1, F2, F3,... describes a path the bargaining
process can take, leading to an outcome n_t=0Ft.
The players’ utility for an outcome is given by
�
UZ=limt�� Ft UZ(x)dxFt for i=1, 2 where XFt is
a probability measure on Ft. If n°t=0Ft={x} the
utility is the point utility of x otherwise it is the
expected utility on the intersection set.

states of the world along a single dimension that
spans the policy variations proposed by the diffe-
rent players (politicians). Politics of a single issue
are routinely modeled as lying on a single dimen-

3.2 Public utility

<bodyText confidence="0.976410257142857">
We note the difference between two types of util-
ities: The utility of the players is over outcomes,
the utility of the public is over sets of outcomes
(frames). The latter does not represent a utility the
public has for one outcome or another, but rather a
utility it has for an enhanced understanding. Thus,
the public’s utility from a frame is a function of
the information content of the proposed frame re-
lative to the current frame, i.e. the relative en-
tropy of the two sets.5 Formally, if the accepted

than two dimensions are needed to account for voting patterns
on all issues in the US Congress.
4Single-peakedness is a common assumption in position
modeling in political science (Downs, 1957).
5The notion that new beliefs are refinements of existing
ones is current in contemporary theorizing about formation
and change of beliefs, evaluations, and preferences. An up-
date based on the latest available information is consistent
with memory-based theories; in our model, in the equilib-
rium, the current frame contains information about the path-
so-far, thus early stages of the bargaining processes are in
some sense integrated into the current frame, compatible with
the rival, online model of belief formation. See Druckman
and Luria (2000) for a review of the relevant literature.

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997669702702703">
At every point in the game, a certain set of the
states-of-affairs is being deemed sufficiently pro-
bable by the public to require consideration. Sup-
pose that initially any state of affairs within the in-
terval [0, 1] is assigned a uniform probability and
thus merits public attention. Each in her turn, the
players propose to the public to concentrate on
a subset of the currently considered states of af-
fairs, arguing that those are the likelier ones to ob-
tain, hence merit further attention. The metaphor
used to deliver the proposal describes the newly
proposed subset in a way that makes those states-
of-affairs that are in it aligned with the metaphor,
ding
whereas all other states are left out of the proposed
metaphorical frame. As the game proceeds, the
publicoattention is concentrated on successively
smaller sets of eventualities, and these are given
a more and more detailed metaphoric description,
providing the educational gratification of increa-
singly knowing better and better what is going on.
At each step, each player strives to provide maxi-
mum public gratification while leading the public
to focus on the frame (i.e. subset of states of af-
fairs) that best meets the player’s preferences.6
Figure 2 sketches the frame negotiation through
train metaphor, from some point in time when the
general train metaphor got established, through
Thatcher’s flashing out the issue of excessive
speed and unclear direction, Major’s multi-track
corrective, and reply of his opponents on the left.
The final frame has all those states of affairs that
fit the extended metaphor – everyone is acting
within the same broad system of rules, with Britain
and perhaps others sometimes wanting to negoti-
ate special, more gradual procedures, which would
leave Britain less tightly integrated into the com-

on the public for which the player bears the consequences and
is therefore a (costly) strategic move in the game. This is dif-
ferent from models of cheap talk such as Aumann (1990),
Lewis (1969) where communication is devoid of strategic
moves and is used primarily as a coordination device.

The theorem states that the outcome of the bar-
gaining will always be a frame on the canoni-
cal path. The rivals would suggest more specific
frames either until convergence or until a situation
where any further specification would produce a
frame that “misses their point,” so-to-speak, by re-
moving too much of the favorable outcome space
for both players. Figure 3 shows a situation where
parties could decide to stall on the current frame:
If player 1 has to choose between retaining F0, or
playing F1 which would result in the rival’s play-
ing F2, player 1 might choose to remain in F0 if
the utility of any outcome of the subgame starting
from F2 is lower than that of F0, as long as player
1 believes that player 2 would reason similarly.
The idea of the proof is to construct a pair of
strategies where each side attempts to pull the pub-
licly accepted frame in the direction of its peak
utility point. We show, assuming the peak of the
first mover is to the left of peak of the second, that
any deviation of the first mover would enable the
second to shift the public frame more to the right,
to an outcome of lower utility to the first mover.
The full details of the proof of part 1 are given in
the appendix; part 2 is proved in an accompanying
technical report.
The equilibrium exhibits the following prop-
erties: (a) a first mover’s advantage — for any
player, the outcome would be closer to her peak
point if she moves first than if she moves second;
(b) a centrist’s advantage — if a player moves first
and her peak is closer to the middle of the initial
frame, she can derive a higher utility from the out-
come than if her peak were further from the mid-
dle. Please see appendix for justifications.

This article studies some properties of frame bar-
gaining through metaphor in political communi-
cation, where rival politicians choose how to ela-
borate the current metaphor to educate the pub-
lic about the ongoing situation in a way most con-
sistent with their political preferences. Modeling
the public preferences as highest relative entropy
subset of possible states-of-affairs, we show that
strategic choices by the politicians lead to a sub-
game perfect equilibrium where the less politically
extreme player who moves first is at an advantage.
In a democracy, such player would typically be
the government, as the bulk of voters do not by
definition vote for extreme views, and since the
government is the agent that brings about changes
in the current states of affairs, and is thus the first
and most prepared to explain them to the public.

4.2 Metaphor in political communication
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999809977272727">
The role of metaphor in communication has long
been a subject of interest, with views ranging from
an ornament that beautifies the argument in the
ancient rhetorical traditions, to the contemporary
views of conceptual metaphor as permeating every
aspect of life (Lakoff and Johnson, 1980).
In political communication specifically,
metaphor has long been known as a framing
device. Framing can be defined as “selecting
and highlighting some facets of events or issues,
and making connections among them in order to
promote a particular interpretation, evaluation,
or solution” (Entman, 2003). Metaphors are
notorious for allowing subliminal framing, where
the metaphor seems so natural that the aspects
of the phenomenon in question that do not align
with the metaphor are seamlessly concealed.
For example, WAR AS A COMPETITIVE GAME
metaphor emphasizes the glory of winning and the
shame of defeat, but hides the death-and-suffering
aspect of the war, which makes sports metaphors
a strategic choice when wishing to arouse a
pro-war sentiment in the audience (Lakoff, 1991).
Such subliminal framing can often be effectively
contested by merely exposing the frame.
Our examples show a different use of metaphor.
Far from being subliminal or covert, the details of
the metaphor, its implications, and the evaluation
promoted by any given version are an important
tool in the public discussion of a complex politi-
cal issue. The function of metaphorical framing
here resembles a pedagogical one, where render-
ing an abstract theory in physics (such as electri-
city) in concrete commonsensical terms (such as
water flow) is an effective strategy to enhance the
students’ understanding of the former (Gentner
and Gentner, 1983). The measure of success for a
given version of the frame is its ability to sway the
public in the evaluative direction envisioned by the
author by providing sufficient educational benefit,
so-to-speak, that is, convincingly rendering a good
portion of a complex reality in accessible terms.
Once a frame is found that provides extensive
education benefit, such as the EUROPEAN INTE-

cian’s attempt to debunk a metaphor as inappropri-
ate risk public antagonism, as this would be akin
to taking the benefit of enhanced understanding
away. Thus, rather than contesting the validity of
the metaphoric frame, politicians strive to find a
way to turn the metaphor around, i.e. accept the
general framework, but focus on a previously un-
explored aspect that would lead to a different eva-
luative tilt. Our results show that being the first
to use an effective metaphor that manages to lock
the public in its framework is a strategic advantage
as the need to communicate with the same public
would compel the rival to take up the metaphor
of your choice. To our knowledge, this is the first
explanation of the use of extended metaphor in po-
litical communication on a complex issue in terms
of the agendas of the rival parties and the chang-
ing disposition of the public being addressed. It
is an open question whether similar “locking in”
of the public can be attained by non-metaphorical
means, and whether the ensuing dynamics would
be similar.

This article contributes to the growing literature on
modeling social linguistic behavior, like debates
(Somasundaran and Wiebe, 2009), dating (Juraf-
sky et al., 2009; Ranganath et al., 2009), colla-
borative authoring and editing in wikis (Leuf and
Cunningham, 2001) such as Wikipedia (Vuong et
al., 2008; Kittur et al., 2007; Vi´egas et al., 2004).
The latter literature in particular sees the social ac-
tivity as an unfolding process, for example, detec-
ting the onset and resolution of a controversy over
the content of a Wikipedia article through track-
ing article talk7 and deletion-and-reversion pat-
terns. Somewhat similarly to the metaphor debate
discussed in this article, Vi´egas et al. (2004) note
first-mover advantage in Wikipedia authoring, that
is, the first version gives the tone for the subse-
quent edits and has its parts survive for relatively
many editing cycles. Finding out how the ini-
tial contribution constrains and guides subsequent
edits of the content of a Wikipedia article and what
kind of argumentative strategies are employed in
persuading others to retain one’s contribution is an
interesting direction for future research.

events are taking place all-at-once — there is no
differentiation between early and later stages of a
debate in Somasundaran and Wiebe (2009) or ini-
tial and subsequent speed-dates for the same sub-
ject in Jurafsky et al. (2009). Yet adopting a dy-
namic perspective stands to reason in such cases.
For example, Somasundaran and Wiebe (2009)
built a system for recognizing stance in an online
debate (such as pro-iPhone or pro-Blackberry on
http://www.covinceme.net). They noticed that the
task was complicated by concessions — acknow-
ledgments of some virtues of the competitor be-
fore stating own preference. This is quite possi-
bly an instance of debate dynamics whereby as the
debate evolves certain common ground emerges
between the sides and the focus of the debate
changes from the initial stage of elucidating which
features are better in which product to a stage
where the “facts” are settled and acknowledged by
both sides and the debate moves to evaluation of
the relative importance of those features.
As another example, consider the construction
of statistical models of various emotional and per-
sonality traits based on a corpus of speed dates
such as Jurafsky et al. (2009). Take the trait of
intelligence. In their experiment with speed-dates,
Fisman et al. (2006) found that males tend to dis-
prefer females they perceive as more intelligent or
ambitious than themselves. Consequently, an in-
telligent female might choose to act less intelligent
in later rounds of speed dating if she has not so far
met a sufficiently intelligent male, assuming she
prefers a less-intelligent male to no match at all.
Better sensitivity to the dynamics of social pro-
cesses underlying the observed linguistic commu-
nication will we believe result in increased inte-
rest in game-theoretic models, as these are espe-
cially well suited to handle cases where the sides
have certain goals and adapt their moves based on
the current situations, the other side’s move, and
possibly other considerations, such as the need to
address effectively a wider audience, beyond the
specific interlocutors. A game theoretic explana-
tion advances the understanding of the process be-
ing modeled, and hence of the applicability, and
the potential adaptation, of statistical models de-
veloped on a certain dataset to situations that dif-
fer somewhat from the original data: For exam-
ple, a corpus with more rounds of speed-dates
per participant might suddenly make females seem
smarter, or a debate with a longer history would
feature more, and perhaps more elaborate, conces-
sions.

We suggested that models of dynamics such as
the one presented in this article be built over data
where entities of interest are clearly identified.
This article is based on chapters 1 and 2 of the
book by Musolff (2000) which itself is informed
by a corpus-linguistic analysis of metaphor in me-
dia discourse in Britain and Germany. We now
discuss the state of affairs in empirical approaches
to detecting metaphors.

5.1 Metaphors in NLP
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999758260869566">
Metaphors received increasing attention from
computational linguistics community in the last
two decades. The tasks that have been ad-
dressed are explication of the reasoning behind
the metaphor (Barnden et al., 2002; Narayanan,
1999; Hobbs, 1992); detection of conventional
metaphors between two specific domains (Mason,
2004); classification of words, phrases or sen-
tences as metaphoric or non-metaphoric (Krishna-
kumaran and Zhu, 2007; Birke and Sarkar, 2006;
Gedigian et al., 2006; Fass, 1991).
We are not aware of research on automatic
methods specifically geared to recognition of ex-
tended metaphors. Indeed, most computational
work cited above concentrates on the detection of
a local incongruity due to a violation of selectional
restrictions when the verb or one of its arguments
is used metaphorically (as in Protesters derailed
the conference). Extended metaphors are expected
to be difficult for such approaches, since many of
the clauses are completely situated in the source
domain and hence no local incongruities exist (see
examples on the first page of this article).

5.2 Data collection
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999931818181818">
Supervised approaches to metaphor detection need
to rely on annotated data. While metaphors are
ubiquitous in language, an annotation project that
seeks to narrow the scope of relevant metaphors
down to metaphors from a particular source do-
main (such as train journeys) that describe a par-
ticular target domain (such as European integra-
tion) and are uttered by certain entities (such as
senior UK politicians) face the problem of spar-
sity of the relevant data in the larger discourse: A
random sample of the size amenable to human an-

notation is unlikely to capture in sufficient detail
material pertaining to the one metaphor of interest.
To increase the likelihood of finding mentions
of the source domain, a lexicon of words from
the source domain can be used to select docu-
ments (Hardie et al., 2007; Gedigian et al., 2006).
Another approach is metaphor “harvesting” –
hypothesizing that metaphors of interest would oc-
cur in close proximity to lexical items representing
the target domain of the metaphor, such as the 4
word window around the lemma Europe used in
Reining and L¨onneker-Rodman (2007).

A further challenge is producing reliable anno-
tations. Pragglejaz (2007) propose a methodo-
logy for testing metaphoricity of a word in dis-
course and report n=0.56-0.70 agreement for a
group of six highly expert annotators. Beigman
Klebanov et al. (2008) report n=0.66 for detec-
ting paragraphs containing metaphors from the
source domains LOVE and VEHICLE with mul-
tiple non-expert annotators, though other source
domains that often feature highly conventiona-
lized metaphors (like structure or foundation from
BUILDLING domain) or are more abstract and dif-
ficult to delimit (such as AUTHORITY) present a
more challenging annotation task.

A fully empirical basis for the kind of model pre-

a metric on metaphors that would allow measu-

metaphor relatively to other such frames – that is,

6 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999635">
This article addressed a specific communicative
setting (rival politicians trying to “sell” to the pub-
lic their versions of the unfolding realities and ne-
cessary policies) and a specific linguistic tool (an
extended metaphor), showing that the particular
use made of metaphor in such setting can be ratio-
nalized based on the characteristics of the setting.
Various questions now arise. Given the cen-
tral role played by the public gratification con-
straint in our model, would conversational situa-
tions without the need to persuade the public, such
as meetings of small groups of peers or phone con-
versations between friends, tend less to the use of
extended metaphor? Conversely, does the use of
extended metaphor in other settings testify to the
existence of presumed onlookers who need to be
“captured” in a particular version of reality — as
in pedagogic or poetic context?
Considerations of the participants’ agendas and
their impact on the ensuing dynamics of the ex-
change would we believe lead to further interest in
game theoretic models when addressing complex
social dynamics in situations like collaborative
authoring, debates, or dating, and will augment
the existing mostly statistical approaches with a
broader picture of the relevant communication.

A Proof of Existence of a Subgame
Perfect Equilibrium
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997605470588235">
For a segment [a, b] and a≤v1&lt;v2≤b let
U1(x)=0(||x − v1||) and U2(x)=0(||x − v2||)
be utility functions with peaks v1 and v2, re-
spectively. For a history h={F0, ... , Ft} where
Ft=[lt, rt], let Q∗ 1(h), player 1’s move, be de-
fined as choosing Ft+1=[lt+1, rt+1] such that
|Ft+1|=|��|
2 , and rt+1 is as close as possible to
v1. Q∗2 sets lt+1 with respect to v2 in a symmet-
ric fashion. Since Ft shrinks by half every round,
limt→∞ lt=limt→∞ rt=x∗, converging to a point.
We now show (Q∗1, Q∗2) is an equilibrium by show-
ing that neither player has a profitable deviation.
Notice that after the first round the subgame is
identical to the initial game with F1 replacing F0,
and the roles of players reversed. Player 2 had no
influence on the choice of F1, hence she has a pro-
fitable deviation iff she has a profitable deviation
on the continuation subgame where she is the first
mover. It thus suffices to show that the first mover
(player 1) has no profitable deviations to establish
that (Q∗1, Q∗2) is an equilibrium.
Since by definition Q∗2 always chooses an en-
tropy maximizing segment, for player 1 to choose
a non-entropy maximizing segment (more or less
than half the length) amounts to yielding the round
to player 2, which is equivalent in terms of the re-
sulting accepted frame to a situation where player
1 chooses an entropy maximizing segment – the
same one chosen by player 2. Thus we need to
consider only deviations with entropy maximizing
frames.
Step 1: Suppose Q01 is a strategy of player 1 and
let F00, F01, F02, ... be the sequence of frames on
</bodyText>

the path corresponding to the pair (σ01, σ∗2). Let
t0 be the first move deviating from the equilibrium
path, namely Ft07�F0t0. We first show that Ft0−1
could not be (a) completely to the left of v1 or (b)
completely to the right of v2. Suppose (a) holds.
Then by definition rt0−2=rt0−1&lt;v1, and, induc-
tively, r0=rt0−1&lt;v1; this contradicts r0=1 thatfol-
lows from F0=[0,1]. Possibility (b) is similarly
refuted. Therefore, the only two cases for Ft0−1
with respect to v1 are depicted in figure 4. Note
that this implies v1&lt;x∗&lt;v2.

Step 2: In case 1, σ∗1 will choose frames of type
[lt, v1] for any t&gt;t0, and σ∗2 will do the same on
any history in the continuation game, hence the
outcome will eventually be v1. As this is player 1’s
peak utility point, she has no profitable deviation.
Step 3: In case 2, Ft0 is the leftmost entropy
maximizing subsegment of Ft0−1 and the devia-
tion F0t0 can only be a shift to the right namely
r0t0&gt;rt0. If player 2 could choose [v2, rt0+1] given
rt0, she can still choose the same frame given r0t0,
so the outcome would be v2 and F0t0 was not pro-
fitable. If player 2 could not choose [v2, rt0+1]
given rt0, implying that x∗&lt;v2, but as a result of
the deviation can now choose [v2, r0t0+1], imply-
ing that the outcome would be v2, clearly player
1 has not benefited from the deviation since U1
is descending right of v1. If player 2 still cannot
choose [v2, r0t0+1] after the deviation, she would
choose the rightmost entropy maximizing segment
with l0t0+1&gt;lt0+1. If this still allows player 1 to
do [l0t0+2, v1] and hence to lead to v1 as the out-
come, it was possible in [lt0+2, v1] as well, so no
profit is gained by having deviated. Otherwise,

rt0+2&gt;rt0+2.

<bodyText confidence="0.997282590909091">
Step 3 can be repeated ad infinitum to show
that r0t&gt;rt unless for some history h the de-
viation enables σ2(h)=[v2,r0t]. In the former
case we get limt→∞ r0t=x0&gt;x∗=limt→∞ rt where
fl∞t=1F0t={x0}. Since r0t and rt are to the right
of v1 and U1 is descending right of v1 it fol-
lows that U1(x∗)&gt;U1(x0). In the latter case
x0&gt;v2. Since Ft is never strictly to the right of v2,
x∗=limt→∞ lt&lt;v2&lt;x0, therefore U1(x∗)&gt;U1(x0).
In either case the deviation σ01 cannot result in a
better outcome for player 1. This finishes the proof
that (σ∗1, σ∗2) is a Nash equilibrium.
Notice that (σ∗1, σ∗2) prescribe sub-strategies on
any subgame that are themselves Nash equilibria
for the subgames, hence (σ∗1, σ∗2) is a subgame per-
fect equilibrium ❑
First Mover’s Advantage: The proof of step
3 shows that having the left boundary of the cur-
rent frame further to the right cannot yield a bet-
ter outcome for player 1. Yet, if player 1’s first
turn comes after that of player 2, she will start
with a current frame with the left boundary further
to the right than the initial frame before player 2
moved, since moving the left boundary is player
2’s equilibrium strategy. Hence a player would
never achieve a better outcome starting second if
both players are playing the canonical strategy.
Centrist’s Advantage: Let M be the middle of
F0. Consider a more extreme version of player 1
—player 1#. Suppose w.l.g. v# 1&lt;v1&lt;M. In case
v#1 &lt;v1&lt;v2, for all utilities u of the outcome of
dynamics vs player 2, if player 1# could attain u,
player 1 could attain u or more; the reverse is not
true, for example when v#1 − lt &lt;|Ft|
2 &lt; v1 − lt
and player 1 (or 1#) is moving first. In case
v2&lt;v#1 &lt;v1, if player 1 (or 1#) moves first, she
is able to force her peak point as the outcome. If
v#1 &lt;v2&lt;v1, player 1 can force v1 as the outcome,
whereas player 1# would not necessarily be able
to force v#1 , as player 2 would pull the outcome
towards v2. Hence a first moving centrist is never
worse off, and often better off, than a first moving
extremist.

We argue that game theory is well suited for modeling discourse as a dynamic resulting from a number of conflicting pressures, and suggest applications of interest to computational linguists.</abstract>

The observable is the actual sequence of moves; importantly, these are assumed to be the optimal outcome (an equilibrium) of the relevant game. A popular notion of equilibrium is Nash equilibrium (Nash, 1950).

As another example, consider the construction of statistical models of various emotional and personality traits based on a corpus of speed dates such as Jurafsky et al. (2009). Take the trait of intelligence. In their experiment with speed-dates, Fisman et al. (2006) found that males tend to disprefer females they perceive as more intelligent or ambitious than themselves. Consequently, an intelligent female might choose to act less intelligent in later rounds of speed dating if she has not so far met a sufficiently intelligent male, assuming she prefers a less-intelligent male to no match at all. Better sensitivity to the dynamics of social processes underlying the observed linguistic communication will we believe result in increased interest in game-theoretic models, as these are especially well suited to handle cases where the sides have certain goals a</context>

We now discuss the state of affairs in empirical approaches to detecting metaphors. 5.1 Metaphors in NLP Metaphors received increasing attention from computational linguistics community in the last two decades. The tasks that have been addressed are explication of the reasoning behind the metaphor (Barnden et al., 2002; Narayanan, 1999; Hobbs, 1992); detection of conventional metaphors between two specific domains (Mason, 2004); classification of words, phrases or sentences as metaphoric or non-metaphoric (Krishnakumaran and Zhu, 2007; Birke and Sarkar, 2006; Gedigian et al., 2006; Fass, 1991). We are not aware of research on automatic methods specifically geared to recognition of extended metaphors. Indeed, most computational work cited above concentrates on the detection of a local incongruity due to a violation of selectional restrictions when the verb or one of its arguments is used metaphorically (as in Protesters derailed the conference). Extended metaphors are expected to be difficult for such approaches, since many of the clauses are completely situated in the source domain and hence no local incongruities exist (see examples on the first page of this article).</context>

To increase the likelihood of finding mentions of the source domain, a lexicon of words from the source domain can be used to select documents (Hardie et al., 2007; Gedigian et al., 2006). Another approach is metaphor “harvesting” – hypothesizing that metaphors of interest would occur in close proximity to lexical items representing the target domain of the metaphor, such as the 4 word window around the lemma Europe used in Reining and L¨onneker-Rodman (2007). 5.3 Data annotation A further challenge is producing reliable annotations.

Our examples show a different use of metaphor. Far from being subliminal or covert, the details of the metaphor, its implications, and the evaluation promoted by any given version are an important tool in the public discussion of a complex political issue. The function of metaphorical framing here resembles a pedagogical one, where rendering an abstract theory in physics (such as electricity) in concrete commonsensical terms (such as water flow) is an effective strategy to enhance the students’ understanding of the former (Gentner and Gentner, 1983). The measure of success for a given version of the frame is its ability to sway the public in the evaluative direction envisioned by the author by providing sufficient educational benefit, so-to-speak, that is, convincingly rendering a good portion of a complex reality in accessible terms. Once a frame is found that provides extensive education benefit, such as the EUROPEAN INTEGRATION AS TRAIN JOURNEY above, a politician’s attempt to debunk a metaphor as inappropriate risk public antagonism, as this would be akin to taking the benefit of enhanced understanding away. Thus, rather than contest</context>

Indeed, Entman’s model of frame activation in political discourse is hierarchical, with the govern702 ment (administration) being the topmost frameactivator, and opposition and media elites typically reacting to the administration’s frame (Entman, 2003). 4.2 Metaphor in political communication The role of metaphor in communication has long been a subject of interest, with views ranging from an ornament that beautifies the argument in the ancient rhetorical traditions, to the contemporary views of conceptual metaphor as permeating every aspect of life (Lakoff and Johnson, 1980). In political communication specifically, metaphor has long been known as a framing device. Framing can be defined as “selecting and highlighting some facets of events or issues, and making connections among them in order to promote a particular interpretation, evaluation, or solution” (Entman, 2003). Metaphors are notorious for allowing subliminal framing, where the metaphor seems so natural that the aspects of the phenomenon in question that do not align with the metaphor are seamlessly concealed.

Metaphors are notorious for allowing subliminal framing, where the metaphor seems so natural that the aspects of the phenomenon in question that do not align with the metaphor are seamlessly concealed. For example, WAR AS A COMPETITIVE GAME metaphor emphasizes the glory of winning and the shame of defeat, but hides the death-and-suffering aspect of the war, which makes sports metaphors a strategic choice when wishing to arouse a pro-war sentiment in the audience (Lakoff, 1991). Such subliminal framing can often be effectively contested by merely exposing the frame. Our examples show a different use of metaphor. Far from being subliminal or covert, the details of the metaphor, its implications, and the evaluation promoted by any given version are an important tool in the public discussion of a complex political issue. The function of metaphorical framing here resembles a pedagogical one, where rendering an abstract theory in physics (such as electricity) in concrete commonsensical terms (such as water flow) is an effective strategy to enhance the students’ understan</context>

It is an open question whether similar “locking in” of the public can be attained by non-metaphorical means, and whether the ensuing dynamics would be similar. 4.3 Social dynamics This article contributes to the growing literature on modeling social linguistic behavior, like debates (Somasundaran and Wiebe, 2009), dating (Jurafsky et al., 2009; Ranganath et al., 2009), collaborative authoring and editing in wikis (Leuf and Cunningham, 2001) such as Wikipedia (Vuong et al., 2008; Kittur et al., 2007; Vi´egas et al., 2004). The latter literature in particular sees the social activity as an unfolding process, for example, detecting the onset and resolution of a controversy over the content of a Wikipedia article through tracking article talk7 and deletion-and-reversion patterns.

Generally, computational linguistics research produces algorithms to detect entities of various kinds, be it topics, named entities, metaphors, moves in a multi-party conversations, or syntactic constructions in large corpora; such primary data can be used to trace developments not only in chronological terms (Gruhl et al., 2004; Allan, 2002), but in strategic terms, i.e. in terms that reflect agendas of the actors, such as political agendas in legislatures (Quinn et al., 2006) or activist forums (Greene and Resnik, 2009), research agendas in group meetings (Morgan et al., 2001), or social agendas in speed-dates (Jurafsky et al., 2009). Game theoretical models are well suited for modeling dynamics that emerge under multiple, possibly conflicting constraints, as we exemplify in this article. 3 The model We extend Rubinstein (1982) model of negotiation through offers and counter-offers between two players with a public benefit constraint.

Numerous inferences regarding speed, timetables, stations, passengers, different classes of tickets, temporary obstacles on the tracks, and so on can be made by the reader based on the knowledge of train journeys, giving him or her a feeling of an enhanced understanding1 of the highly complex process of European integration. So apt was the metaphor that political fights were waged over its details (Musolff, 2000). Worries about destination were given an eloquent expression by Margaret Thatcher (Sunday Times, 20 Sept 1992): She warned EC leaders to stop their endless round of summits and take notice of their own people. “There is a fear that the European train will thunder forward, laden with its customary cargo of gravy, towards a destination neither wished for nor understood by electorates. But the train can be stopped,” she said. 1More on enhanced understanding in sections 3.2 and 4.2. 698 Proceedings of the 48th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 698–709, Uppsala</context>

The pro-European camp rallied around the “Britain in the slow lane” version as a critical stance towards the government’s European policy. Of the alternative metaphors, the school metaphor has some traction in the Euro discourse, where the European (mainly German) financial officers are compared to school authorities, and governments struggling to meet the strict convergence criteria to enter the Euro are compared to pupils that barely make the grade with Britain as a ‘drop-out’ who gave up even trying (Musolff, 2000). The fact that European policy is being communicated and negotiated via a metaphor is not surprising; after all, “there is always someone willing to help us think by providing us with a metaphor that accords with HIS views.”2 From the point of view of the dynamics of political discourse, the puzzle is rather the apparent tendency of politicians to be compelled by the rival’s metaphorical framework. Thatcher tries to turn the train metaphor used by the pro-EU camp around.

Different moves yield different utilities for a player; it is assumed that each player would pick a strategy that maximizes her utility. The observable is the actual sequence of moves; importantly, these are assumed to be the optimal outcome (an equilibrium) of the relevant game. A popular notion of equilibrium is Nash equilibrium (Nash, 1950). For extensive form games (the type employed in this paper), the notion of subgame perfect equilibirum is typically used, denoting a Nash equilibrium that would remain such if the players start from any stage of the evolving game (Selten (1975; 1965)).

The latter does not represent a utility the public has for one outcome or another, but rather a utility it has for an enhanced understanding. Thus, the public’s utility from a frame is a function of the information content of the proposed frame relative to the current frame, i.e. the relative entropy of the two sets.5 Formally, if the accepted 3Indeed, Poole and Rosenthal (1997) argue that no more than two dimensions are needed to account for voting patterns on all issues in the US Congress. 4Single-peakedness is a common assumption in position modeling in political science (Downs, 1957). 5The notion that new beliefs are refinements of existing ones is current in contemporary theorizing about formation and change of beliefs, evaluations, and preferences.

To increase the likelihood of finding mentions of the source domain, a lexicon of words from the source domain can be used to select documents (Hardie et al., 2007; Gedigian et al., 2006). Another approach is metaphor “harvesting” – hypothesizing that metaphors of interest would occur in close proximity to lexical items representing the target domain of the metaphor, such as the 4 word window around the lemma Europe used in Reining and L¨onneker-Rodman (2007). 5.3 Data annotation A further challenge is producing reliable annotations. Pragglejaz (2007) propose a methodology for testing metaphoricity of a word in discourse and report n=0.56-0.70 agreement for a group of six highly expert annotators. Beigman Klebanov et al.

Different moves yield different utilities for a player; it is assumed that each player would pick a strategy that maximizes her utility. The observable is the actual sequence of moves; importantly, these are assumed to be the optimal outcome (an equilibrium) of the relevant game. A popular notion of equilibrium is Nash equilibrium (Nash, 1950). For extensive form games (the type employed in this paper), the notion of subgame perfect equilibirum is typically used, denoting a Nash equilibrium that would remain such if the players start from any stage of the evolving game (Selten (1975; 1965)).

It is an open question whether similar “locking in” of the public can be attained by non-metaphorical means, and whether the ensuing dynamics would be similar. 4.3 Social dynamics This article contributes to the growing literature on modeling social linguistic behavior, like debates (Somasundaran and Wiebe, 2009), dating (Jurafsky et al., 2009; Ranganath et al., 2009), collaborative authoring and editing in wikis (Leuf and Cunningham, 2001) such as Wikipedia (Vuong et al., 2008; Kittur et al., 2007; Vi´egas et al., 2004). The latter literature in particular sees the social activity as an unfolding process, for example, detecting the onset and resolution of a controversy over the content of a Wikipedia article through tracking article talk7 and deletion-and-reversion patterns. Somewhat similarly to the metaphor debate discussed in this article, Vi´egas et al. (2004) note first-mover advantage in Wikipedia authoring, that is, the first version gives the tone for the subsequent edits and has its parts survive for relatively many editing cycles.
