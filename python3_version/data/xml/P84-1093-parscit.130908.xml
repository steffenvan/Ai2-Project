<bodyText confidence="0.999926444444444">
The papers in this panel consider machine-readable
dictionaries from several perspectives: research in
computational linguistics and computational lexicology, the
development of tools for improving accessibility, the design of
lexical reference systems for educational purposes, and
applications of machine-readable dictionaries in information
science contexts. As background and by way of introduction, a
description is provided of a workshop on machine-readable
dictionaries that was held at SRI International in April 1983.

Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999949361111111">
Dictionaries constitute a unique resource for a broad range of
research involving natural language, information, knowledge,
and the analysis of contemporary culture. Although they are
often regarded as the special preserve of lexicographers and
lexicologists, data contained in dictionaries have significant
implications for research in linguistics, computational
linguistics, artificial intelligence, information science,
psychology, anthropology, sociology, philosophy, education, and
probably other fields as well. Dictionaries embody the lexicon
of the language. They provide phonological, grammatical,
semantic, and historical information relevant for linguists and
other language specialists. They are useful adjuncts for the
development of natural-language-understanding systems and
natural-language-interface technology. They can provide a
mechanism for processing full-text data sources and for
information retrieval more generally. Dictionary data figure in
psychological experiments on language and perception.
Semantics and usage are reflected in ways that are factored into
ethnosemantic and sociolinguistic research. Philosophical and
logical inquiries build on lexical information. For education,
dictionaries provide not only reference, but are practical aid for
teaching both adults and children reading and writing skills.
Dictionaries have always had these potential attributes, but
they are complex structures and difficult to manipulate.
Having them available in machine-readable form makes more
sophisticated research in lexicology and lexicography possible--
and the results of such work feed back into research in the
other areas mentioned above. In addition, dictionaries can be
utilized in areas like word processing and office automation,
where people are currently showing considerable interest in
them. A number of dictionaries have now been prepared by
computer typesetting, so the tapes used to drive the
photocomposer are available. However, there is a significant
difference between having a dictionary in computerized form
and having a database embodying its contents which can be
accessed in a number of different ways.

A Workshop
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999875642857143">
Recognizing the potential of machine-readable dictionaries
and, at the same time, the lack of coordination among people
working in the field, Bob Amsler and I organized a A Workshop
on Machine-Readable Dictionaries at SRI International in
April 1983. The National Science Foundation agreed to provide
funds (Grant No. IST-8300940; SRI Project 5699), and we
succeeded in involving 29 people from Belgium, England, West
Germany, Italy, Japan, Sweden, and the United States for a
period of three days. The group included research scientists
from universities and institutes, publishers, and people involved
in marketing dictionary products.
There were a number of objectives that motivated convening
the workshop and that served as a guide to its organization and
the assessment of its results:

1. Clarification of the research interests and goals of
both the participants and the broader community
that they represent. Including in the latter are
dictionary publishers and the various classes of
potential users of machine-readable dictionaries and
their by-products.
2. Identification of the resources in the field: for

example, dictionaries actually in machine-readable
form, the people engaged in research on them,
programs developed for processing dictionary data,
references to the relevant literature.

<listItem confidence="0.925502416666667">
3. Examination of the problems entailed in research in
this area.
4. Delineation of computational requirements for
various research tasks.
5. Specification of guidelines for dictionary design,
both form and content.
6. Formulation of a comprehensive plan to coordinate
research efforts in the field.
7. Determination of needs and potential sources of
funding for research.
8. Arrangements for future workshops or other
meetings.

A volume containing a challenge paper prepared by Bob
Amsler, contributions from a number of the participants,
summaries of the discussions, and an extensive bibliography of
work in the field is in preparation.
