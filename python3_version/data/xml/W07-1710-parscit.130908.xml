Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999856291666667">
In the paper we describe enriching Czech
WordNet with the derivational relations
that in highly inflectional languages like
Czech form typical derivational nests (or
subnets). Derivational relations are mostly
of semantic nature and their regularity in
Czech allows us to add them to the Word-
Net almost automatically. For this purpose
we have used the derivational version of
morphological analyzer Ajka that is able to
handle the basic and most productive
derivational relations in Czech. Using a
special derivational interface developed in
our NLP Lab we have explored the seman-
tic nature of the selected noun derivational
suffixes and established a set of the seman-
tically labeled derivational relations –
presently 14. We have added them to the
Czech WordNet and in this way enriched it
with approx. 30 000 new Czech synsets. A
similar enrichment for Princeton WordNet
has been reported in its recently released
version 3.0, we will comment on the partial
similarities and differences.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999947789473685">
WordNets as such represent huge semantic net-
works in which the basic units – synsets – are
linked with the ‚main‘ semantic relations like syn-
onymy, near_synony my, antonymy, hypero/hy-
ponymy, meronymy and others. In the EuroWord-
Net project (cf. Vossen, 2003) Internal Language
Relations (ILR) have been introduced such as
Role_Agent, Agent_Involved or Role_Patient, Pa-
tient_Involved etc., as well as the relation Deriva-
tive capturing derivational relations between
synsets. The semantic nature of the derivational
relations, however, was not systematically ana-
lyzed and labeled in EuroWordNet project.
If we try to label the derivational relations se-
mantically and include them in WordNet as a re-
sult we get two level network where on the higher
level we have the ‚main‘ semantic relations be-
tween synsets such as synonymy, near_syn-
onymy, antonymy, hypero/hyponymy, meronymy
and others and on the lower level there are rela-
tions like the derivational ones that hold rather be-
tween literals than between synsets.
In the highly inflectional languages the deriva-
tional relations represent a system of semantic re-
lations that definitely reflects cognitive structures
that may be related to a language ontology. Such
ontology undoubtedly exists but according to our
knowledge it has not been written down yet. How-
ever, for language users derivational affixes (mor-
phemes) function as formal means by which they
express semantic relations necessary for using
language as a vehicle of communication. In our
view, the derivational relations should be consid-
ered as having semantic nature though a question
may be asked what kind of semantics we are deal-
ing with (see Sect. 3). It has to be remarked that
grammatical categories such as gender or number
display a clear semantic nature.

formal morphology in Czech grammars and its de-
scription mostly deals with the system of the in-
flectional paradigms. Then there is a derivational
morphology which deals with deriving words from
other words, e.g. nouns from verbs, adjectives
from nouns or verbs etc. using affixes again. The
derivations are closely related to the inflectional
paradigms in a specific way: we can speak about
derivational paradigms as well (cf. Pala, Sedláček,
Veber, 2003).
For Czech inflectional morphology there are au-
tomatic tools – morphological analyzers exploiting
the formal description of the inflection paradigms
– we work with the analyzer called Ajka (cf.
Sedláček, Smrž, 2003) and developed in our NLP
Lab. Its list of stems contains approx. 400 000
items, up to 1600 inflectional paradigms and it is
able to generate approx. 6 mil. Czech word forms.
We are using it for lemmatization and tagging,
as a module for syntactic analyzer, etc. We have
also developed a derivational version of Ajka (D-
Ajka) that is able to work with the main regular
derivational relations in Czech – it can generate
new word forms derived from the stems. Together
with D-Ajka an MWE preprocessing module with
the database containing approx. 100 000 colloca-
tions is exploited as well.

2.1 Derivational relations in Czech
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997257375">
The derivational relations (D-relations) in Czech
cover a large part of the word stock (up to 70 %).
Thus we are interested in describing derivational
processes (see examples) by which new words are
formed from the corresponding word bases (roots,
stems). In Czech grammars (Mluvnice češtiny,
1986) we can find at least the following main types
(presently 14) of the derivational processes:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.994621403508772">
1. mutation: noun -&gt; noun derivation, e.g.
ryba -ryb-ník (fish -&gt; pond), semantic relation
expresses location – between an object and its
typical location,
2. transposition (existing between different
POS): noun -&gt; adjective derivation, e.g. den
-&gt; den-ní (day -&gt;daily), semantically the rela-
tion expresses property,
3. agentive relation (existing between different
POS): verb -&gt; noun e.g. učit -&gt; uči-tel (teach
-&gt; teacher), semantically the relation exists
between action and its agent,
4. patient relation: verb -&gt; noun, e.g. trestat
-&gt; trestanec (punish -&gt;convict), semantically
it expresses a relation between an action and
the object (person) impacted by it,
5. instrument (means) relation: verb -&gt; noun,
e.g. držet -&gt; držák (hold -&gt;holder),
semantically it expresses a tool (means) used
when performing an action,
6. action relation (existing between different
POS): verb -&gt; noun, e.g. učit -&gt; uče-n-í
(teach -&gt; teaching), usually the derived nouns
are charaterized as deverbatives, semantically
both members of the relation denote action
(process),
7. property-va relation (existing between
different POS): verb -&gt; adjective, e.g.
vypracovat -&gt; vypracova-ný (work out -&gt;
worked out), usually the derived adjectives
are labelled as de-adjectives, semantically it is
a relation between action and its property,
8. property-aad relation (existing between
different POS): adjective -&gt; adverb, e.g.
rychlý -&gt; rychl-e (quick -&gt; quickly),
semantically we can speak about property,
9. property-an (existing between different
POS): adjective -&gt; noun, e.g. rychlý -&gt; rychl-
ost (fast -&gt; speed), semantically the relation
expresses property in both cases,
10. gender change relation: noun -&gt; noun,
e.g. inženýr -&gt; inženýr-ka (engineer -&gt; she
engineer), semantically the only difference is
in sex of the persons denoted by these nouns,
11. diminutive relation: noun -&gt; noun -&gt;
noun, e.g. dům -&gt; dom-ek -&gt; dom-eček
(house -&gt; small house -&gt; very little house or
a house to which a speaker has an emotional
attitude), in Czech the diminutive relation can
be binary or ternary,
12. augmentative relation: noun -&gt; noun, e.g.
bába -&gt; bab-izna (beldame -&gt; hag),
semantically it expresses different emotional
attitudes to a person,
13. prefixation: verb -&gt; verb, e.g myslet -&gt;
vy-myslet (think -&gt; invent), semantically
prefixes in Czech denote a number of

different relations such as distributive,
location, time, measure and some others. We
will not be dealing with this topic here, it calls
for a separate examination (project),
14. possessive relation (existing between
different POS): noun -&gt; adjective otec -&gt;
otczcv (father -&gt; father’s), semantically it is a
relation between an object (person) and its
possession.
We should mention two more relations that are
sometimes regarded inflectional but in our view
they belong here as well: gerund relation - verb -&gt;
adjective: (bojovat -&gt;bojující, fight -&gt; fighting)
and passive relation – verb -&gt; adjective (passive
participle): (učit -&gt; učen, teach -&gt; taught).
These 14 (+2) relations have been taken as a
starting point for including derivational relations in
Czech Wordnet. The main condition for their in-
cluding is whether they can be generated by the
derivational version of the analyzer Ajka. In this
way we have been able to obtain automatically a
precise specification what literals are linked to-
gether. It was also necessary to introduce the labels
for the individual relations in a more systematic
way. As a result we have obtained the following
list of 10 derivational relations with their semantic
labels that are given in the brackets and hold be-
tween the indicated POS:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999723333333333">
1. deriv-na: noun -&gt; adjective (property)
2. deriv-ger: verb -&gt; adjective (property)

relation)
5. deriv-pas: verb -&gt; adjective (passive relation)
6. deriv-aad: adjective -&gt; adverb (property of
property)
7. deriv-an: adjective -&gt; noun (property)
8. deriv-g: noun -&gt; noun (gender relation)
9. deriv-ag: verb -&gt; noun (agentive relation)
10. deriv-dem: noun -&gt; noun (diminutive relation)

in CzWn when the D-Ajka will be able to handle
them (in the near future).

2.2 Derivational nests – subnets
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999953444444445">
If we have a look at the data, i.e. at the list of
Czech stems and affixes and try to see how the
just described relations work we obtain the typical
derivational clusters – we will prefer to call them
derivational nests (subnets). To illustrate their
regularity we adduce an example of such nest for
the Czech roots – prác/prac- (work). The main re-
lations holding between these roots and the corre-
sponding suffixes are:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.925341846153846">
roots: -prác-/-prac-e-
deriv-act - prac-ova-t (to work)
deriv-loc1- prac-ov-iště (workplace)
deriv-loc2 - prac-ov-na (study)
deriv-ag1- prac-ov-ník (worker),
deriv-g - prac-ovn-ice (she-worker),
deriv-ag2 - prac-ant (plodder)
deriv-ger - prac-uj-ící (working - person)
deriv-pro - prac-ov-ní (professional,
working)
deriv-pro - prac-ov-i-t-ý (diligent,
hardworking)
deriv-pro - prac-ov-i-t-ost (diligence)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999928888888889">
The proposed labels are not final yet – the num-
ber of the productive derivational relations that
have to be examined in Czech is larger, certainly
up to 15. Number of the derivational suffixes in
Czech is higher – more than 80.
At the moment the derivational Ajka is not able
to generate the full nests automatically but we
continue processing the remaining Czech deriva-
tional suffixes for this purpose.

2.3 Processing derivational suffixes
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99853">
So far we have not said much about the affixes,
i.e. prefixes, stem-forming infixes and suffixes
used in derivations. In this analysis we pay atten-
tion mainly to the suffixes, prefixes are related
mostly to verbs and in this sense they represent a
separate and rather complicated derivational sys-
tem. Infixes or intersegments are basically cov-
ered by the list of stems – instead writing rules for
changes in stems we just use more variants of one

stem. But the root analysis is possible and if we
want to describe the derivational processes in
Czech as completely as possible we have to return
to them.
As starting data we have used a list of noun
stems taken from the stem dictionary of the D-Ajka
analyzer – their number is approx. 126 000. The
derivations have been analyzed by means of the
web interface developed just for this purpose.
Noun derivations are performed in the three basic
steps:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999551333333333">
1. a set of words is defined by means of the (pre-
fix), suffix and morphological tag;
2. defining a derivational rule – typically a substi-
tution of morphemes (suffixes) at the end of the
word;
3. manual modification of the results – usually cor-
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.970541636363637">
recting or deleting cases that cannot be regarded as
properly derived forms though they may follow the
given rule.
An example of the derivational analysis for
Czech sufix –ík: it occurs with the nouns denoting
agent or instrument (means), e.g. zed-n-ík (brick-
layer) or kapes-ník (hankerchief).
First we want to derive agentive nouns: so we
enter the suffix –ík and tag k1gM (noun, masculine
animate) and generate the list of all words ending
with -ík. The output is a list of 1210 nouns includ-
ing proper names (from the original list of 126 000
Czech nouns). To obtain instrument nouns we in-
put the tag k1gI (noun, masculine inanimate). As
an output result we get a list of 715 nouns includ-
ing proper names. The number of all words ending
with suffix -ík (disregarding the grammatical tag)
in stem dictionary of Ajka is 1830. The difference
in the given numbers follows from the homonymy,
for instance, some nouns can be both masculine
animate and masculine inanimate (e.g. náčelník
can denote – chief as well as čelenka – headband.
Such cases have been checked manually.
In a similar way we have processed 22 Czech
derivational suffixes and as a result we have ob-
tained a detailed classification of the indicated
derivations capturing agentive, instrumental, loca-
tion and also resultative relations, for instance
spálit -&gt; spálenina (to burn -&gt; a burn) which has
not been mentioned before. At the same time the
complete lists of all stems with the indicated suf-
fixes together with labeling their semantic relations
between the stems and respective suffixes was ob-
tained as well. For the processed suffixes the cov-
erage is complete (with regard to the list of
126 000 of the Czech noun stems).
Thus using the described procedure we are try-
ing to find pairs of the word forms in which the
first one is considered basic and the second one
derived. The direction of the derivations is not al-
ways unambiguous but the most important
goal is to establish the relation itself not its direc-
tion. The cases when changes in stem take place
have to be checked and added manually.

is labeled semantically so we have here the follow-

gerund, passive – the last two may be characterized
as more morphological (surface, see Sect. 2.1) than
the first three.
In Princeton WordNet 3.0 we can observe the
following three D-relations associated with the
synset {teach:1, learn:5, instruct:1}

It is not surprising that the full agreement between
Czech and English D-relations includes only the
agentive relation (teach -&gt; teacher) and gerund re-
lation (teach -&gt; teaching). The relation teach -&gt;
teachable is not included among Czech relations at
the moment but it will be easy to add it. The loca-
tion relation is missing in English and also some
others characterized usually as morphological. We
included them in Czech WordNet – they belong to
the set of the Czech derivational relations.
If we compare semantic labeling of the D-rela-
tions in both Wordnets we observe that they are
more explicitly formulated in Czech Wordnet.
The question that remains to be answered is how
the different senses may be or are reflected in the
individual derivations. In PWN 3.0 the derivation
teach – teacher is given twice because there are
two different senses of teach in PWN 3.0. In our
view, it is enough to give this derivational relation
just once because it is agentive in both cases. Of
course, in Czech there are frequent cases like
držet -&gt; držák (hold -&gt; holder) and držet -&gt; drži-
tel (hold -&gt; holder) where the first one is instru-
ment relation and the second agentive but in
Czech the different suffixes have to be used (-ák
vs. -tel) indicating a difference in gender as well
(masculine inanimate vs. masculine animate).

<sectionHeader confidence="0.594069" genericHeader="method">
3 What is the nature of the D-relations?
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997950785714286">
In the previous sections we have introduced the
labeling of the Czech D-relations. The question
may be asked what is the real nature of D-rela-
tions, whether it is semantic or rather morphologi-
cal (formal). The D-relations exist between mor-
phemes, typically between stems and correspond-
ing suffixes. This formal feature makes them dif-
ferent from the relations between sentence con-
stituents, as e.g. between verbs and their argu-
ments. However, the main criterion for us is
whether the particular relation affects meaning ir-
respective of its formal realization.
If we apply this criterion to the D-relations dis-
cussed above, such as deriv-ag, deriv-loc, deriv-
instr, deriv-g, deriv-dem, deriv-pos, deriv-pro, we
definitely come to the conclusion that their nature
is semantic.
Then there are relations like deriv-an, deriv-na,
deriv-dvrb, deriv-ger, deriv-aad, deriv-pas that are
sometimes characterized as morphological only
and their semantics is left aside. The first two re-
lations hold between nouns and adjectives and
both denote properties (e.g. deriv-an: nový -&gt;
novost (new -&gt; newness)), but we have to take
into account that there is something that may be
called semantics of the parts of speech, i.e. in one
case property is expressed by the adjective and
then by the noun which is derived from the adjec-
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.996622">
79
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999708">
tive. Deriv-na denotes property as well but here the
adjective is derived from noun as in boj -&gt; bo-
jovný (fight -&gt; combative). The relation deriv-
dvrb exists between a verb and noun, e.g. učit -&gt;
učení (teach -&gt; teaching), and it denotes action
which is first expressed by the verb and then by the
deverbative noun. We can say that in these cases
the only difference lies in the optics of the individ-
ual parts of speech but this difference should be
understood as semantic as well. However, it should
be remarked once more that quite often the differ-
ences in the semantics of the parts of speech are
not treated as truly semantic.
If we have look what standard Czech grammars
(see e.g. Karlík et al, 1995) say about the semantics
of the parts of speech we find the formulations
such as: nouns denote independent entities, i.e.
persons, animals and things and also properties and
actions. Verbs then denote states and their changes
and processes (actions) and their mutations. These
descriptions certainly refer to the semantics of the
nouns and verbs. They are usually followed by the
explanations about morphological processes, i. e.
usually derivations by which some parts of speech
are formed from the others, as we have described
them above. What is relevant and what is missing
in the standard grammars are more detailed and ex-
tensive semantic classifications of nouns, verbs, as
well as adjectives and numerals. They are begin-
ning to appear only recently and have the form of
ontologies – the standard grammars do not use this
term at all.
Until we have such semantic classifications de-
scribing semantic relations between the individual
parts of speech we can hardly have a full picture
that is necessary for automatic processing of the
derivational relations.
This issue certainly calls for a more detailed ex-
amination, which would be a topic for another pa-
per.

4 The implementation of D-relations in
Czech WordNet
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999985972972973">
The existing software tools (e.g.Visdic, cf. Horák,
Smrž, 2004 ) used for building Wordnet databases
standardly work with semantic relations between
synsets and they treat them as atomic units. In fact,
the synsets are not atomic as such and they consist
of the smaller units called literals, i.e. for instance
the synset {teach:1, instruct:1} contains two liter-
als (lemmas).
If we want to deal with the D-relations auto-
matically we immediately face a problem: be-
cause of their nature they typically hold not be-
tween synsets but between literals that as a rule
belong to the different synsets, e.g. teach:1 and
teacher:1. Therefore we need a tool that is able to
define and create derivational links between the
literals. According to our knowledge the only tool
that can do this is DEBVisdic editor and browser
developed at our NLP Lab at FI MU (cf. Horák,
Pala, 2006, it can be downloaded from: http://nlp.-
fi.muni.cz/projekty/deb2/clients/).
We have used it for the implementation of the
D-relations in Czech WordNet (the result is
shown in Sect. 2.4). The DEBVisdic tool is now
used for representing and storing all the semantic
relations including the D-relations. It is also ex-
ploited for building Wordnets in other languages
such as Polish, Slovenian, Hungarian and others.
In our view, the way in which the D-relations
(and other relations as well) are represented
relevantly depends on the software tools used.
This can be demonstrated if we compare the
representation of the Czech D-relations in
DEBVisdic with the one in PWN 3.0 (see Sect.
2.4) which appears to be less explicit and rather
verbose. This also means that the representation
used in PWN 3.0 will be probably less suitable for
possible applications.

These numbers also tell us how productive the
particular relations are. Note that the most frequent
is passive relation which is followed by the dever-
bative (action) relation. The third most frequent re-
lation is a possessive one. It would be interesting to
examine what these facts can tell us about semantic
structure of texts.

<bodyText confidence="0.999890395348837">
In the paper we present the first results of compu-
tational analysis of the basic and most regular D-
relations in Czech using derivational version of the
morphological analyzer Ajka.
Though the analysis is far from complete at the
moment the number of the generated items has led
us to the decision to include them in Czech Word-
Net and enrich it considerably with the derivational
nests (subnets). In our view, this kind of enrich-
ment makes Czech WordNet more suitable for
some applications, namely for searching.
The second and even more important reason for
doing all this is a belief that the derivational rela-
tions and derivational subnets created by them re-
flect basic cognitive structures existing in natural
language. More effort is needed for exploring them
from the point of view of now so popular ontolo-
gies – they certainly offer a formal ground (they
are expressed by the individual morphemes) for
natural language based ontologies.
We have also included a brief comparison with
the recently released Princeton WordNet 3.0 which
now contains derivational links for English as well.
As we expected the comparison confirms the
known fact that English as an analytic language is
much poorer with regard to the derivational rela-
tions than the inflectional ones.
From the technical point of view PWN 3.0 is still
not using the representation in XML format (as
DebVisdic does) and this, we think, in certain de-
gree limits the possibilities to express some of the
links in a standard way. The present web interface
where Princeton WordNet 3.0 can be browsed:
http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn) does
not seem to be able to work directly with the links
between literals.
On the other hand, we are well aware that
adding D-relations to PWN 3.0 is very stimulating
and useful though it will be quite demanding to
establish the derivational links between English
and other languages (through Interlingual Index).
This makes it a new challenge for the whole
WordNet community.

<abstract confidence="0.999534">In the paper we describe enriching Czech WordNet with the derivational relations that in highly inflectional languages like Czech form typical derivational nests (or subnets). Derivational relations are mostly of semantic nature and their regularity in Czech allows us to add them to the Word- Net almost automatically. For this purpose we have used the derivational version of morphological analyzer Ajka that is able to handle the basic and most productive derivational relations in Czech. Using a special derivational interface developed in our NLP Lab we have explored the semantic nature of the selected noun derivational suffixes and established a set of the semantically labeled derivational relations – presently 14. We have added them to the Czech WordNet and in this way enriched it with approx. 30 000 new Czech synsets. A similar enrichment for Princeton WordNet has been reported in its recently released version 3.0, we will comment on the partial similarities and differences.</abstract>

In the EuroWordNet project (cf. Vossen, 2003) Internal Language Relations (ILR) have been introduced such as Role_Agent, Agent_Involved or Role_Patient, Patient_Involved etc., as well as the relation Derivative capturing derivational relations between synsets. The semantic nature of the derivational relations, however, was not systematically analyzed and labeled in EuroWordNet project. If we try to label the derivational relations semantically and include them in WordNet as a result we get two level network where on the higher level we have the ‚main‘ semantic relations between synsets such as synonymy, near_synonymy, antonymy, hypero/hy</context>
