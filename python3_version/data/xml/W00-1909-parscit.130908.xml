This paper describes a specific part of the
Prague Dependency Treebank annotation, the
step from the surface dependency structure
towards the underlying representation of the
sentence. The first section explains the
theoretical basis of the project. In Section 2 all
the procedure of conversion to the
tectogrammatical structure is summarized and

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999975">
A semi-automatic syntactic annotation of a part
of the Czech National Corpus in the Prague
Dependency Treebank (PDT) has among its
aims the possibility to check the theoretical
approach chosen (Functional Generative
Description, see [2]), as well as to establish a
basis that could serve as a suitable starting point
for a large-scale monographic analysis of the
numerous problems of the sentence structure in
general and of the grammar of Czech in
paritcular which still require empirical research.
Such an analysis is expected to be helpful at
least in three respects:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.766684142857143">
(i) to make a relatively complete description of
Czech into a realistic task,
(ii) to fill lacunes present in the prelimnary form
of the annotation procedures formulated up to
now, and
(iii) to proceed towards a procedure that would
be automatized to a maximally high degree.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999175957446809">
We do hope that our paper may be useful in
attracting more attention not only to the need of
an annotation reaching the underlying sentence
structure (rather than just the usual ’surface-
structure’ parsers, which may help in natural
language processing, although not that much in
achieving the aims of a theoretical linguistic
description), but also to a deep-reaching
comparison of different approaches to syntax.
We are convinced that dependency-based syntax
with its maximally economical tree structures
may be of particular interest for the aims of
contemporary computational linguistics. This
holds especially of an approach in which
function words are classed together with
inflectional morphemes as corresponding to
indices in complex node labels, rather than to
specific nodes, and in which also other aspects
of the underlying, tectogrammatical, structure
are established. Moreover, a comparison of the
problems concerned in syntactic annotation
procedures for languages of different types
certainly can be important if general theories of
language description are looked for and
compared with each other; such a theory should
show the core of linguistic structure to be
economical enough both to help explain the
easiness of mother tongue acquisition and to be
implementable in computers.
A language with rich inflection and with a high
degree of &amp;quot;free&amp;quot; word order, such as Czech,
cannot be handled by primarily using cues based
on cooccurrence with neighboring items, but
requires specific procedures for the
disambiguation of morphemic units
(prepositional and simple case forms, agreement
forms, etc.), which hardly could be fully
automated. The work on such procedures has led
to our conviction that many insights of classical
structural linguistics may still be highly useful,
although they have not been duly reflected in
theories using an approach based on
constituency (that originated with Bloomfieldian
descriptivism). Considering syntactic
dependency (which is being developed on the
basis of the work of L. Tesniere) to constitute
the primary layer of sentence patterns, we work
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.999275">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.9995116875">
with a structure that corresponds to extremely
flat constituency patterns, and we use no
nonterminals in the dependency trees. Instead of
notions such as NP or AP, the dependency
approach shows just items dependent
(immediately or not) on a noun or an adjective,
respectively. A detailed discussion of
tectogrammatics, which cannot be included into
the present paper, can be found in [2], [4].
The following strategy of annotation has been
found useful, and this may hold also for many
other languages: The first phases of the
annotation of PDT are (i) the morphemic
representations and (ii) the dependency trees on
an intermediate (’surface’) analytic level, i.e.
analytic tree structures (ATSs, see [1]), where (i)
has to use a combination of statistical and
structural methods to obtain a reliable automatic
treatment, and (ii) has to be carried out
manually. While (i) and (ii) have been discussed
elsewhere, the present paper is devoted to a
subsequent phase (iii), the transduction
(conversion) from ATSs to (underlying) syntax
itself, i.e. to tectogrammatical representations,
which should be provided for 10 000 sentences
during the year 2000 (at its start, 100 000
sentences have obtained their ATS annotations).
The main points of the transduction include:
(a) deleting those nodes of the ATSs which
correspond to function words and to most
punctuation marks, with an indication of their
functions in the form of indices of the
corresponding lexical (i.e. autosemantic, rather
than auxiliary) occurences; as an exception, we
use nodes for coordinating conjunctions (as
heads of the coordinated constructions), thus
working with underlying representations in the
specific form of ’tectogrammatical tree
structures’ (TGTSs); (b) assigning every lexical
occurrence the appropriate syntactic functors
(which distinguish more than 40 kinds of
syntactic relations, i.e. of kinds of valency slots,
e.g. PAT (patient or objective), ADDRessee,
LOCative, MANNer) and morphological
grammatemes (marking the values of tense,
aspect, modalities, number, etc.), as well as
syntactic grammatemes (values such as ’in, on,
under, among’ with Locative or Directional);
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.991985375">
(c) restoring those nodes of TGTSs which are
deleted in the surface form of the input
sentences;
(d) indicating the position of every node in the
topic-focus articulation (TFA) with a scale of
communicative dynamism, represented as
underlying word order (see [2], [3] for a
discussion of TFA).
</listItem>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.690189" genericHeader="method">
2 Automatic parts of transduction:
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995653">
The transduction from ATSs to underlying trees
has the following three parts, the first of which
is discussed in more detail in Section 3:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.991946428571429">
(i) an automatic ’pre-processing’ module,
(ii) a manual part, which changes the analytic
functions (esp. Subject, Object, Adverbial,
Attribute), into corresponding functors (only the
most basic cases are changed automatically);
nodes for the deleted items are ’restored’ (mostly
as pronouns); the TFA indices for focus,
contrastive and non-contrastive topic are
specified; a ’user-friendly’ software enables the
annotators to work with diagrammatic shapes of
trees;
(iii) a subsequent automatic module adds first of
all
(a) information on the lexical values of restored
nodes in unmarked cases in which the (marked)
values have not been specified in (ii): esp. in
coordinated constructions the values of the
(symmetric) counterparts in the given
construction are added;
(b) certain values of syntactic grammatemes
(esp. where a preposition allows for a reliable
choice);
(c) at the same time, the gender and number
values are cancelled whenever they only indicate
agreement (as with adjectives in most positions),
and
(d) the remaining nodes corresponding to
commas, dashes, quotes, etc. are deleted.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999635">
In the next months, the automatic procedure is
supposed to be enriched in various respects,
such as the build-up of the lexicon (with entries
including the valency frames), word derivation,
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.956074">
66
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999886">
and the degrees of activation of the ’stock of
shared knowledge,’ as far as derivable from the
use of nouns and pronouns in subsequent
utterances. Several types of grammatical
information, e.g., the disambiguated values of
prepositions and conjunctions, can only be
specified after further empirical investigations,
in which, whenever possible, also statistical
methods will be used. In any case, the annotated
corpus will offer a suitable starting point for
monographic elaboration of the problems
concerned.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.782101">
3.1 TGTS description
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997323818181818">
Every node of the TGTS contains all the
information inherited from the ATS, and new
attributes are added.
The trlemma attribute contains the lemma of
the node. The trlemma of a single node (even
if the node is hidden, i.e. marked as absent in the
TGTS) is equal to its analytical lemma assigned
in the ATS. The compound nodes that represent
more than one word of the surface sentence are
assigned the trlemma attribute in the following
way:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.997078571428571">
• Verbal nodes: lemma of the autosemantic
(lexical) verb.
• Compound prepositions, conjunctions and
numeratives: trlemma is composed of the
lemmas of the parts of the item (e.g. the
three nodes representing numerative 1150
‘tis’c sto pades‡t’ are joined into one node
with trlemma = ‘tis’c_sto_pades‡t’).
• Newly added nodes are assigned either
proper lexical values (in case of filled
deletions - mostly pronouns), or technical
lexical values, such as ‘Gen’ for the general
participant, ‘Cor’ for the coreferential node
of a controlee, or ‘Neg’ for negation.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99997285">
The morphological grammatemes are captured
using the attributes of: gender, number, degree
of comparison, tense, aspect, iterativeness,
verbal modality, deontic modality, sentence
modality.
Next to the morphological grammatemes there
are attributes describing the position of the node
at the tectogrammatical level: topic-focus
articulation, functor, syntactic grammateme,
type of relation (dependency, coordination,
apposition), phraseme, deletion, quoted word,
direct speech, coreference, antecedent and some
other, technical attributes. The attribute
‘function word (fw)’ is used for storing the
preposition or conjunction of the word for the
later resolution of the syntactical grammatemes.
The attributes ‘deep order (dord)’ and
‘sentence order (sentord)’ are used to
distinguish between the sentence surface word
order and the deep word order.

<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.980459">
3.2.1 Auxiliary verbs, i.e. verbmod attribute
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998892">
The verb is conjoined with its auxiliary nodes
into a complex value of a single node, placed in
the highest position in the relevant subtree. All
AuxV nodes are hidden. The verb is assigned the
values of the grammatemes of tense and verb
modality on the basis of the lexical values of
these auxiliary nodes. The lemma of the
autosemantic verb is put into the trlemma
attribute of the remaining node, which is
assigned the grammateme values depending on
the AuxV dependent nodes.
The tables below show what assignments are
made in the automatic procedure for the verbal
node. Table 1 contains the rules applied to the
nodes for autosemantic verbs, the rules are
captured in the table rows in the sequence they
are being used. If all the conditions are fulfilled
for some node, the rule is applied. E.g. the
second row of the table reads as follows: If the
verb daughter node is labelled either with the
lemma “být” or“by”, disregarding the possible
presence of “se” (which was already handled by
rule 1), and the morphological tag of the verb
begins “VR” (symbol for preterite tense), then
assign the verb attribute tense the value ANT.

The reflexive particle ‘se’ has three possible

analytical function value AuxT is assigned to a
reflexive ‘se’ having the function of lexical
derivation (of a middle verb). As shown in Table
1, ‘se’ is conjoined with the lemma of the verb
in such case. If ‘se’ was assigned the function
‘AuxR’ at the analytical level, it expresses a
general actor of the verb. The node is preserved,
its attribute trlemma is filled with the ‘Gen’

The sentence is searched for quotation marks. If
a whole clause having the form of a sentence is
inserted into a pair of double quotes, its verb
obtains the value ’DSP’ (direct speech) on the
attribute quot. If only one token of a double
quote appears in the sentence, the attribute
quot of the head word(s) of the string
containing the quote is assigned ‘DSPP’ value
(direct speech part). Otherwise, the head word(s)
of the string enclosed in quotes is/are assigned
quot = ’QUOT’ (quoted word).

3.2.6 Punctuation
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.718381428571428">
All punctuation nodes (which have the analytical
function ‘AuxX’) are hidden except for the
following two cases:
• the node for a comma placed in the position
directly following a noun is left in the tree to
enable the annotators to decide about the
type of the adjunct (restrictive or
descriptive),
• a comma node that is a bearer of
coordination or apposition is not deleted, as
far as this function can be recognized from
the ATS.
The trlemma attribute of undeleted comma
node is filled with Comma value.

<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.729444">
3.2.7 Node for negation
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999871">
Every verb is checked. If its morphological tag
contains the symbol for negative verb, a new
node is created with the lexical (trlemma)
value ‘Neg’ and functor ‘RHEM’ (rhematizer,

Based on the morphological tag inherited from
the analytical level of description, the values of
the following morphological grammatemes are
assigned: gender , number, tense, degcmp
(degree of comparison), aspect.
The sentence modality is captured in the
sentmod attribute of the head node of each
clause. We assign the sentence modality of the
head word of a simple sentence, of the main
clause of a complex sentence and of all
coordinated clauses in compound sentences. The
sentence modality attribute value is determined
by the final punctuation mark of the whole
sentence and by the verb modality of the main

Subject, Object, Adverbial, Attribute), into corresponding functors (only the most basic cases are changed automatically); nodes for the deleted items are ’restored’ (mostly as pronouns); the TFA indices for focus, contrastive and non-contrastive topic are specified; a ’user-friendly’ software enables the annotators to work with diagrammatic shapes of trees; (iii) a subsequent automatic module adds first of all (a) information on the lexical values of restored nodes in unmarked cases in which the (marked) values have not been specified in (ii): esp. in coordinated constructions the values of the (symmetric) counterparts in the given construction are added; (b) certain values of syntactic grammatemes (esp. where a preposition allows for a reliable choice); (c) at the same time, the gender and number values are cancelled whenever they only indicate agreement (as with adjectives in most positions), and (d) the remaining nodes corresponding to commas, dashes, quotes, etc. are deleted. In the next months, the automatic procedure is supposed to be enriched in various respects, such as the build-up of the lexicon (with entries including the valency frames), word derivation, 66 and the degrees of activation of the ’stock of shared knowledge,’ as far as derivable from the use of nouns and pronouns in subsequent utterances. Several types of grammatical information, e.g., the disambiguated values of prepositions and conjunctions, can only be specified after further empirical investigations, in which, whenever possible, also statistical methods will be used. In any case, the annotated corpus will offer a suitable starting point for monographic elaboration of the problems concerned. 3 The first part of the automatic transduction 3.1 TGTS description Every node of the TGTS contains all the information inherited from the ATS, and new attributes are added. contains the lemma of node. The a single node (even if the node is hidden, i.e. marked as absent in the TGTS) is equal to its analytical lemma assigned in the ATS. The compound nodes that represent more than one word of the surface sentence are the in the following way: • Verbal nodes: lemma of the autosemantic (lexical) verb. • Compound prepositions, conjunctions and composed of the lemmas of the parts of the item (e.g. the three nodes representing numerative 1150 ‘tis’c sto pades‡t’ are joined into one node ‘tis’c_sto_pades‡t’). • Newly added nodes are assigned either proper lexical values (in case of filled deletions mostly pronouns), or technical lexical values, such as ‘Gen’ for the general participant, ‘Cor’ for the coreferential node of a controlee, or ‘Neg’ for negation. The morphological grammatemes are captured using the attributes of: gender, number, degree of comparison, tense, aspect, iterativeness, verbal modality, deontic modality, sentence modality. Next to the morphological grammatemes there are attributes describing the position of the node at the tectogrammatical level: topic-focus articulation, functor, syntactic grammateme, type of relation (dependency, coordination, apposition), phraseme, deletion, quoted word, direct speech, coreference, antecedent and some other, technical attributes. The attribute word is used for storing the preposition or conjunction of the word for the later resolution of the syntactical grammatemes. attributes ‘deep order and order are used to distinguish between the sentence surface word order and the deep word order. 3.2 The steps of the procedure Auxiliary verbs, i.e. The verb is conjoined with its auxiliary nodes into a complex value of a single node, placed in the highest position in the relevant subtree. All AuxV nodes are hidden. The verb is assigned the values of the grammatemes of tense and verb modality on the basis of the lexical values of these auxiliary nodes. The lemma of the autosemantic verb is put into the trlemma attribute of the remaining node, which is assigned the grammateme values depending on the AuxV dependent nodes. The tables below show what assignments are made in the automatic procedure for the verbal node. Table 1 contains the rules applied to the nodes for autosemantic verbs, the rules are captured in the table rows in the sequence they are being used. If all the conditions are fulfilled for some node, the rule is applied. E.g. the second row of the table reads as follows: If the verb daughter node is labelled either with the or“by”, disregarding the possible presence of “se” (which was already handled by rule 1), and the morphological tag of the verb begins “VR” (symbol for preterite tense), then the verb attribute value ANT. 67 Presence of dependent node with lemma Morph. tag of the verb Assigned attributes no (to be) by (cond.) se, f=AuxT 1 - yes trlemma =&gt; attach ‘_se’ to trlemma of the verb 2 no no - VR tense =&gt; ANT 3 no no - VU tense =&gt; POST 4 no no other tense =&gt; SIM 5 no yes - tense =&gt; SIM verbmod CDN 6 yes yes - tense =&gt; ANT verbmod CDN 7 yes no - tense =&gt; ANT 1. Examples: .VR =&gt; trlemma= (rule 2) opened .VR =&gt; trlemma= (rule 1) 5) would learn (iii) =&gt; 6) would have slept could have been seen Modal verbs, i.e. The modal verb is merged with the autosemantic verb depending on it in the ATS. The transduction procedure consists in three steps: the tree is rearranged in that the modal verb depends on the autosemantic verb, the value for the attribute deontmod of the latter verb is assigned its value according to the lexical value of the modal verb, and the modal verb node is deleted.

Modal verbs. Prepositions and conjunctions, i.e. attribute Every preposition node is deleted and its lexical is stored in the attribute the noun. The preposition will be used for the future (at least partly automatized) determination of the value of the syntactic grammateme of the noun. Every subordinating conjunction node is deleted. lexical value is stored in the of the head verb of the subordinate clause. Conjunctions for coordination and apposition are used in the tectogrammatical tree as the heads of the coordinated clauses. 3.2.4 General actor The reflexive particle ‘se’ has three possible analytical functions in a Czech sentence. The analytical function value AuxT is assigned to a reflexive ‘se’ having the function of lexical derivation (of a middle verb). As shown in Table 1, ‘se’ is conjoined with the lemma of the verb in such case. If ‘se’ was assigned the function ‘AuxR’ at the analytical level, it expresses a general actor of the verb. The node is preserved, attribute filled with the ‘Gen’ value and its functor is ‘ACT’. If &apos;se&apos; was assigned the function &apos;OBJ&apos;, it gets the functor &apos;PAT&apos;. mohla jsem ( it 7) 68 Quotation marks, i.e. The sentence is searched for quotation marks. If a whole clause having the form of a sentence is inserted into a pair of double quotes, its verb obtains the value ’DSP’ (direct speech) on the If only one token of a double quote appears in the sentence, the attribute the head word(s) of the string containing the quote is assigned ‘DSPP’ value (direct speech part). Otherwise, the head word(s) of the string enclosed in quotes is/are assigned ’QUOT’ (quoted word). 3.2.6 Punctuation All punctuation nodes (which have the analytical function ‘AuxX’) are hidden except for the following two cases: • the node for a comma placed in the position directly following a noun is left in the tree to enable the annotators to decide about the type of the adjunct (restrictive or descriptive), • a comma node that is a bearer of coordination or apposition is not deleted, as far as this function can be recognized from the ATS. of undeleted comma is filled with 3.2.7 Node for negation Every verb is checked. If its morphological tag contains the symbol for negative verb, a new is created with the lexical value ‘Neg’ and functor ‘RHEM’ (rhematizer, i.e. focus sensitive particle). 3.2.8 Other attribute assignments Based on the morphological tag inherited from the analytical level of description, the values of the following morphological grammatemes are of comparison), The sentence modality is captured in the of the head node of each clause. We assign the sentence modality of the head word of a simple sentence, of the main clause of a complex sentence and of all coordinated clauses in compound sentences. The sentence modality attribute value is determined by the final punctuation mark of the whole sentence and by the verb modality of the main verbs of the sentence clauses. The rules are described by Table 3. Suppose we have a sentence composed of clauses ...., and position in clause Xi final interp. verb modali -ty sentence modality of Xn other conditions verb modality assigned Xn ? - - - INTER (verb in the last or in the only clause) ! - - - IMPER . - - - ENUNC X1, ...., Xn-1 For n&gt;1 - - INTER - INTER - IND - - ENUNC - IMP - - IMPER - CDN contains DESID (E:’let’) - CDN otherwise ENUNC Table 3. Sentence modality assignment As for functors, their value is resolved automatically in the following three cases. Value ACT (actor/bearer, underlying subject) is assigned to every subject of an active verb. If there is a single object depending on an active verb, its node is assigned functor PAT (patient, objective). The head verbs of the sentences are assigned the functor PRED (predicate). Example: (i) .A ACT spotted the neighbour 3.2.9 „Default“ values Unresolved syntactic and morphological grammatemes are assigned their default value by the procedure. By the default value we understand ‘NIL’ value for attributes that cannot be assigned any value for the given node (e.g. case for verbal nodes), or it is chosen to express 69 the uncertainty for the annotators (e.g. value for unresolved References 3.3 Example of input and output Sentence: annotated corpus: The Prague Dependency In: of Valency and Meaning. in Honour of Jarmila Panevov‡ Karolinum.
