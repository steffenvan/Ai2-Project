This volume contains texts of the papers presented at the Fourth Conference of
the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics, reserve papers,
and tutorial abstracts.
Over 130 papers were submitted for the conference, and the overall standard was
high: it was with regret and difficulty that the Programme Committee were able to
accept only 45, even including parallel sessions and reserve papers. We are grateful to
all those who submitted papers, to the Programme Committee and referees for reading
them, and to all who worked hard on local arrangements. Our thanks in particular to
Prof. J. C. Sager and to the secretarial staff of the Centre for Computational
Linguistics, UMIST for many forms of moral and material support. Don Walker and
the officials of the European Chapter, Maghi King, Beat Buchmann, and Mike Rosner,
also did much to make it all possible.

Discourse places two demands on a communicative agent: (1) the need to comprehend
and produce multiple utterances, each being interpreted in the context of those
preceding it, and (2) the need to treat utterances as intentional behavior. Both
processes seem to be inherently computational. That is, to model changes in context
and attention requires consideration of the side effects of understanding and producing
utterances. Similarly, interpreting and responding to utterances as intentional behavior
requires support for planning and plan inference. This tutorial explores emerging
computational models and methods for both contextual and intentional aspects of
discourse.

Combinatory Categorial Grammars

The session will discuss a generalisation of Categorial Grammar based on the inclusion
of a few syntactic operations related to &amp;quot;combinators&amp;quot;, such as functional composition.
The theory implies a radical revision of accepted notions of surface structure and
constituency, with interesting implications for theories of the production and
comprehension of spoken and written language.
The theory will be presented in the first instance as a theory of syntactic competence,
with particular attention to constructions involving coordination and unbounded
dependency. Attention will be paid to certain universal properties of such
constructions across languages. The discussion will then be widened to consider the
implications of this theory of syntax for selected problems in prosody and intonation,
incremental semantic interpretation, and processing.

Knowledge of and about words underlies all natural language processing tasks. This
tutorial will focus on the complementary questions of content and format(s) of
computational lexicons, after looking in some detail at the specific lexical requirements
of natural language processing systems.
In particular, we will study some recent developments in theories of grammar and
lexical semantics, and observe the implications in the way they handle lexical
information for the organization of computational lexicons. We will trace, through a
number of illustrative examples, issues like formalization of lexical information,
flexibility and extendability of lexicon formats, scaling up prototype lexical systems,
and acquisition of lexical knowledge, and observe how these inter-relate during the
process of designing lexical components for realistic natural language processing
systems.

Abstract
In this talk I would like to address some issues of major importance in lexical semantics. In particular, I
will discuss four topics relating to current research in the field: methodology, descriptive coverage,
adequacy of the representation, and the computational usefulness of representations. In addressing these
issues, I will discuss what I think are some of the central problems facing the lexical semantics
community, and suggest ways of best approaching these issues. Finally, I outline a theory of lexical
semantics embodying a richer notion of compositionality, termed cocomposition, which aims to spread
the semantic load more evenly throughout the lexicon.

1. Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996173363636364">
I believe we have reached an interesting turning point in research, where linguistic studies can be
informed by computational tools for lexicology as well as an appreciation of the computational
complexity of large lexical databases. Likewise, computational research can profit from an awareness of
the grammatical and syntactic distinctions of lexical items; natural language processing systems must
account for these differences in their lexicons and grammars. The wedding of these disciplines is so
important, in fact, that I believe it will soon be impossible to carry out serious computational research
in our field without the help of electronic dictionaries and computational lexicographic resources
[Walker, 1986]. Positioned at the center of this synthesis is the study of word meaning, lexical
semantics, which is currently witnessing a minor revival.
Given this, I would like to turn to a few issues that I feel the lexical semantics community should
address. In particular, I will pose the following four questions:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999012714285714">
1. Has recent work in lexical semantics been methodologically any sounder than the previous work in
the field?
2. Do theories being developed today have any broader coverage than the earlier descriptive work?
3. Do current theories provide any new insights into the representation of knowledge for the global
structure of the lexicon?
4. Finally, has recent work provided the computational community with useful resources for parsing,
generation, and translation research?
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999097333333333">
Before answering these questions, I would like to establish two points that will figure prominently in
our critique of the field. The first is that, without an appreciation of the syntactic structure of a
language, the study of lexical semantics is bound to fail. There is no way in which meaning can be
completely divorced from the structure that carries it. This is more a methodological point than
anything else, since grammatical distinctions are a useful metric in evaluating competing semantic
theories.
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999979592592593">
The second point is that the meanings of words should somehow reflect the deeper, conceptual
structures in the system and the domain it operates in. This is tantamount to stating that the semantics
of natural language should be the image of (nonlinguistic) conceptual organizing principles (whatever
their structure).
Some of the major points I would like to make here are the following. First, a clear notion of semantic
well-formedness will be necessary in order to characterize a theory of possible word meaning. This may
entail idealizing the notion of lexical meaning away from other semantic influences. For instance, this
might suggest that discourse and pragmatic factors should be handled differently or separately from the
semantic contributions of lexical items in composition (contra [Hobbs, 1987]. Although this is not a
necessary assumption and may in fact be wrong, it may help narrow our focus on what is important for
lexical semantic descriptions.
Secondly, lexical semantics must look for representations that are richer than thematic role descriptions
[Fillmore, 1968]. As argued in [Levin and Rappaport, 1986], named roles are useful, at best, for
establishing fairly general mapping strategies to the syntactic structures in language. The distinctions
possible with &amp;quot;theta&amp;quot; roles are much too coarse-grained to provide a useful semantic interpretation of a
sentence. What is needed, therefore, is a principled method of lexical decomposition. This presupposes,
if it is to work at all, (1) a rich, recursive theory of semantic composition, (2) the notion of semantic
well-formedness mentioned above, and (3) an appeal to levels of interpretation in the semantics [Scha,
1983].
Thirdly, and related to the point above, the lexicon is not just verbs. Recent work has done much to
clarify the nature of verb classes and the syntactic constructions that each allows [Levin, 1985]. Yet it
is not clear whether we are any closer to understanding the underlying nature of verb meaning, why the
classes develop as they do, and what consequences these distinctions have for the rest of the lexicon
and grammar. The curious thing is that there has been little attention paid to the other lexical categories
(but see [Fass, 1988]. That is, we have little insight into the semantic nature of adjectival predication,
and even less into the semantics of nominals. Not until all major categories have been studied can we
hope to arrive at a balanced understanding of the lexicon and the methods of composition.

2. Methods in Lexical Semantics
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9359354">
Given what I have said, let us examine the questions presented above in more detail. Because of space,
I will have little to say concerning question (4) in this short note. First, let us turn to the issue of
methodology. How can we determine the soundness of our method? Are new techniques available now
that have not been adequately explored? Very briefly, we can summarize the most essential techniques
assumed by the field, in some way, as follows (see, for example [Cruse, 1986]):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.976634535714286">
1. On the basis of categorial distinctions, establish the fundamental differences between the grammatical
classes; the typicial semantic behavior of a word of category X.
2. Find distinctions between elements of a word class on the basis of collocation and cooccurrence tests.
For example, &amp;quot;dog&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;rock&amp;quot; partition into different classes due to certain features.
3. Test for distinctions of a grammatical nature on the basis of diathesis; i.e. alternations that are
realized in the syntax. For example, break vs. cut in (i) and (ii) below [Hale and Keyser, 1986].
(i) a. The glass broke.
b. John broke the glass.
(ii) a. *The bread cut.
b. John cut the bread.
This results in ever-finer distinctions in the semantic and syntactic behavior of verbs.
4. Test for entailments in the word senses of a word, in different grammatical contexts. The same
lexical item may carry different entailments in different contexts. For example, &amp;quot;forget&amp;quot; in (i):
(i) a. John forgot that he locked the door.
b. John forgot to lock the door.
Sentence (a) has a factive interpretation of &amp;quot;forget&amp;quot; that (b) does not carry.
5. Test for the ambiguity of a word. Distinguish between ambiguity and polysemy, (cf. [Hirst, 19871,
[Foss, 1988]) and from the accidental nature and the logical nature of ambiguity. For example, the
ambiguity between the two senses of &amp;quot;bank&amp;quot; in (i)
and the polysemy in (ii).
(i) a. the bank of the river
b. the richest bank in the city
(ii) a. The bank raised its interest rates yesterday.
b. The store in next to the bank.
6. Establish what the compositional nature of a lexical item is when applied to other words. For
example, &amp;quot;alleged&amp;quot; vs. &amp;quot;tall&amp;quot; in the example below.
(i) a. the alleged suspect
b. the tall suspect
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99199">
While &amp;quot;tall&amp;quot; is a simple intersective modifier in (b) we must be aware of the intensional behavior of
adjectives such as &amp;quot;alleged&amp;quot; in (a).
This just briefly characterizes some of the techniques that have been useful for arriving at pre-theoretic
notions of word meaning. What has changed over the years are not so much the methods themselves as
the descriptive details provided by each test. One thing that has changed, however, --and this is
significant-- is the way computational lexicography has provided stronger techniques and even new
tools for lexical semantics research: for sense discrimination tasks [Atkins 1987]; for constructing
concept taxonomies [Amsler 1985, Atkins, Klavans and Boguraev, forthcoming]; for establishing
semantic relatedness among word senses [Wilks et al, 19881; as well as for testing new ideas about
semantic representations [Boguraev and Pustejovsky, forthcoming].
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.554311">
3. Descriptive Adequacy of Existing Representations
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997635">
Turning now to the question of how current theories compare with the coverage of lexical semantic
data, there are two generalizations that should be made. First, the taxonomic descriptions that have been
made of verb classes are far superior to the classifications available twenty years ago (see [Levin, 1985]
for review). Using mainly the descriptive vocabulary of [Talmy, 1975, 1985] and [Jackendoff, 1983],
fine and subtle distinctions are drawn that were impossible to capture in the earlier primitives-approach
of [Schank, 1972, 19751 or the frame semantics of [Fillmore, 1968]. There are two problems with the
current work, however. Unlike the theories of [Wilks, 19751 and [Quilfian, 1968], there is no general
coherent view on what the entire lexicon will look like when semantic structures for other major
categories are studied. Furthermore, it is not clear whether this work embodies a real theory of
knowledge representation. We can, however, view this research as the first step towards constructing a
theory of lexical semantics which is integrated into a linguistic theory, as well as interpreted in a
knowledge representation system.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.54758" genericHeader="method">
4. Explanatory Adequacy of Existing Representations
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999733058823529">
Finally, let us turn to the question of whether current theories have changed the way we look at
representation and lexicon design. The question here is whether the representations assumed by current
theories are adequate to account for the richness of natural language semantics. It should be pointed out
here that a theory of lexical meaning will affect the general design of our semantic theory in several
ways. If we view the goal of a semantic theory as being able to recursively assign meanings to
expressions, (accounting for phenomena such as synonymy, antonymy, polysemy, metonymy, etc.), then
our view of compositionality depends ultimately on what the basic lexical categories of the language
denote. Conventional wisdom on this point paints a picture of words behaving as either active functors
or passive arguments [Montague, 1974]. But if we change the way which categories can denote, then
the form of compositionality itself changes. Therefore, if done well, lexical semantics forces us to
reevaluate the very nature of semantic composition in language (see, for example [Keenan and Faltz,
1985]).
In what ways could lexical semantics affect the larger methods of composition in semantics? I
mentioned above that most of the careful representation work has been done on verb classes. In fact,
the semantic weight in both lexical and compositional terms usually falls on the verb. This has obvious
consequences for how to treat lexical ambiguity. For example, consider the verb &amp;quot;bake&amp;quot; in the two
sentences below.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.985079">
(1) a. John baked the potato.
b. John baked the cake.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.945256">
[Atkins, Kegl, and Levin, 1988] demonstrate that verbs such as &amp;quot;bake&amp;quot; are ambiguous, with both a
&amp;quot;change-of-state&amp;quot; sense (la) and a &amp;quot;create&amp;quot; sense (lb).
A similar ambiguity exists with verbs that allow the resulative construction, shown in (2) and (3), and
discussed in [Dowty, 1979], [Jackendoff, 1983], and [Levin and Rapoport, 1988].
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999363">
(2) a. Mary hammered the metal.
b. Mary hammered the metal flat.
(3) a. John wiped the table.
b. John wiped the table clean.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9985175">
On many views, the verbs in (2) and (3) are ambiguous, related by either a lexical transformation
[Levin and Rapoport, 1988], or a meaning postulate [Dowty, 1979]. In fact, given strict requirements on
the way that a verb can project its lexical information, the verb &amp;quot;run&amp;quot; in (4) will also have two lexical
entries, depending on the syntactic environment it selects [Talmy, 1985], [Levin and Rappaport, 1989].
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.558856">
(4) a. Mary ran yesterday.
</listItem>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.383238">
b. Mary ran to the store yesterday.
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999653333333333">
These two verbs differ in their semantic representations, where the &amp;quot;run&amp;quot; in (4b) means &amp;quot;go-to-by-
means-of-running&amp;quot;, while in (4a) it means simply &amp;quot;move-by-running&amp;quot;.
The methodology described above for distinguishing word senses is also assumed by those working in
more formal frameworks. For example, [Dowty, 1985] proposes multiple entries for control and raising
verbs, and establishes their semantic equivalence with the use of meaning postulates. That is, the verbs
in (5) and (6) are lexically distinct but semantically related by rules.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.98309425">
(5) a. It seems that John likes Mary.
b. John seems to like Mary.
(6) a. Mary prefers that she come.
b. Mary prefers to come.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999912384615385">
Given the conventional notions of function application and compositionality, there is little choice but to
treat all of the above cases as polysemous verbs. Yet, something about the systematicity of such
ambiguity suggests that a more general, simpler explanation should be possible. By relaxing the
conditions on how the meaning of a complex expression is derived from its parts, we can, in fact, arrive
at a very straightforward explanation for cases of &amp;quot;logical polysemy.&amp;quot;
The basic idea is this. Rather than treating the expressions that behave as arguments to a function as
simple, passive objects, imagine that they are as active in the semantics as the verb itself. The product
of function application would be sensitive to both the function and its active argument. Something like
this is suggested in [Keenan and Faltz, 19851, as the &amp;quot;Meaning-Form Correlation Principle.&amp;quot;
What I have in mind can best be illustrated by returning to the examples in (1). Rather than having
two word senses for a verb such as &amp;quot;bake,&amp;quot; suppose there is simply one, a &amp;quot;change-of-state.&amp;quot; Now,
assume that &amp;quot;bake&amp;quot; can be lexically specified as a Process verb [Pustejovsky, 19881. It is a general
property of Processes, that they can shift their &amp;quot;aspectual type&amp;quot; to become a telic event. For example,
&amp;quot;push the wagon&amp;quot; can shift from a Process to a Transition (&amp;quot;push the wagon to Mary&amp;quot;) by general
principles of event composition (cf. [Pustejovsky, 1988]). Assume further, that our semantic theory
makes a logical distinction between &amp;quot;potatoes&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;cakes&amp;quot; in terms of natural versus artifactual objects.
Any artifact can be identified with the state of being that object, along with the purpose of the object,
and other information. Most importantly, however, an artifact has a kind of stative interpretation as part
of its meaning.
Notice that the two senses for &amp;quot;bake&amp;quot; in (1) are the result of compositionality in a richer sense. For
observe that the &amp;quot;create&amp;quot; sense arises by the same principle of event composition mentioned above.
Namely, that there is a baking process, and it results in a cake. This is the &amp;quot;create&amp;quot; sense, and it is
present just in those cases where an artifactual stative is already encoded in the argument (see
[Pustejovsky, 1989] for details).
In fact, similar principles seem to be operating in the examples mentioned in (2) through (4); namely,
systematic ambiguity is the result of principles of semantic composition, rather than lexical ambiguity. I
will call this particular kind of case &amp;quot;cocompositionality.&amp;quot;
In explaining the behavior of the systematic ambiguity above, I made reference to properties of the
Noun Phrase that are not typical semantic properties for nouns in linguistics, e.g. artifact, natural kind.
In [Pustejovsky, 1989] and [Pustejovsky and Anick, 19881, I suggest that there is a system of relations
that characterizes the semantics of nominals, very much like the argument structure of a verb. I call this
the &amp;quot;Qualia Structure&amp;quot;, adopting a term from [Goodman, 1951]. Essentially, the qualia structure of a
noun determines its meaning as much as the list of arguments determines a verb&apos;s meaning. The
elements that make up a qualia structure include notions such as &amp;quot;container,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;space,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;surface,&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;figure,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;artifact,&amp;quot; and so on.
When we combine the qualia structure of a NP with the argument structure of a verb, we begin to see a
richer notion of compositionality emerging, one that looks very much like object-oriented approaches to
programming [Ingria and Pustejovsky, 1988]. As an example, consider the two senses of &amp;quot;window&amp;quot; and
&amp;quot;door&amp;quot; in (7) and (8) below:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.8402865">
(7) a. John crawled through the window.
b. The window is closed.
(8) a. Mary painted the door.
b. Mary walked through the door.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999953923076923">
Each noun appears to have two senses: an object denotation, and a portal denotation. We can
characterize the meaning of such &amp;quot;Double Figure Ground&amp;quot; nominals as a three place relation, roughly
something like N(Figure,Invert-Figure,Ground), where Figure refers to the artifact itself, Invert-Figure
refers to the portal, and Ground is a reference constant. The foregrounding or backgrounding of a
nominal&apos;s qualia is very similar to argument structure-changing operations for verbs. That is, in (8a)
&amp;quot;paint&amp;quot; applies to the Figure interpretation of &amp;quot;the door,&amp;quot; while in (8b), &amp;quot;through&amp;quot; will apply to the
Invert-Figure interpretation of the same NP. The ambiguity with such nouns is a logical one, one that is
intimately linked to the semantic representation of the object itself. The qualia structure is a way of
capturing this fact.
Having discussed the notion of logical polysemy, let us conclude our brief discussion of lexical
semantics with the issue of metonymy. Metonymy, where a subpart or related part of an object
&amp;quot;stands&amp;quot; for the object itself, also poses a problem for standard denotational theories of semantics. For
example, how can we account for the reference shifts such as those shown in (9)?
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9360545">
(9) a. Thatcher vetoed the channel tunnel.
b. Mary enjoyed the book.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997819">
I suggest that these are cases of semantic &amp;quot;type coercion&amp;quot;, where the verb has coerced the meaning of a
term phrase into a different semantic type. In the case of (9a), it is obvious that what is vetoed is some
proposal relating to the object. In (9b), the book is enjoyed only by virtue of some event or process that
involves the book, performed by Mary. It might furthermore be reasonable to assume that the qualia
structure of &amp;quot;book&amp;quot; specifies what the artifact is used for; i.e. reading. Such coercion results in a word
sense for the NP that I will call &amp;quot;logical metonymy.&amp;quot; Roughly, logical metonymy is where a logical
argument of a semantic type (selected by a function) denotes the semantic type itself. For details see
[Pustejovsky, 1989].
Another interesting example involves the possible subjects of causative verbs. These are also cases of
logical metonymy. Consider the sentences in (10) and (11).
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.996192666666667">
(10) a. The pictures of himself frightened John.
b. A cup of coffee in the morning woke John up.
(11) a. John killed Mary.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.895026625">
b. The gun killed Mary.
c. John&apos;s stupidity killed Mary.
d. The war killed Mary.
e. John&apos;s pulling the trigger killed Mary.
The sentences in (10) illustrate the various syntactic consequences of metonymy and coercion involving
experiencer verbs, while those in (11) show the different &amp;quot;metonymic extensions&amp;quot; possible from the
causing event in a killing. The generalization here is that when a verb selects an event as one of its
arguments, type coercion to an event will permit a limited range of logical metonymy.

S. Conclusion
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999717">
In this paper I have tried to cover what I believe are currently some of the most interesting issues in
lexical semantics. I have also tried to outline an approach to meaning where the semantic load is
spread more evenly throughout the lexicon. This entails a semantic description of noun classes, termed
a &amp;quot;theory of Qualia,&amp;quot; as well as the rules of composition that allow this information to be incorporated
into the semantic interpretation of larger expressions. Although much of what I have presented is
incomplete and somewhat programmatic, I firmly believe this approach can help clarify the nature of
word meaning and compositionality in natural language.

<abstract confidence="0.9553764">MT systems developed so far are surveyed, and the basic characteristics of MT which distinguish it from other NLP applications are discussed. New trends in research such as telephone dialogue translation, knowledge-based MT etc. are also discussed. Discourse Bonnie Lynn Webber (U Penn) Discourse places two demands on a communicative agent: (1) the need to comprehend and produce multiple utterances, each being interpreted in the context of those preceding it, and (2) the need to treat utterances as intentional behavior. Both processes seem to be inherently computational. That is, to model changes in context and attention requires consideration of the side effects of understanding and producing utterances. Similarly, interpreting and responding to utterances as intentional behavior requires support for planning and plan inference. This tutorial explores emerging computational models and methods for both contextual and intentional aspects of discourse.</abstract>

<author confidence="0.983521">Mark Steedman</author>
<abstract confidence="0.97218596">The session will discuss a generalisation of Categorial Grammar based on the inclusion of a few syntactic operations related to &amp;quot;combinators&amp;quot;, such as functional composition. The theory implies a radical revision of accepted notions of surface structure and constituency, with interesting implications for theories of the production and comprehension of spoken and written language. The theory will be presented in the first instance as a theory of syntactic competence, with particular attention to constructions involving coordination and unbounded dependency. Attention will be paid to certain universal properties of such constructions across languages. The discussion will then be widened to consider the implications of this theory of syntax for selected problems in prosody and intonation, incremental semantic interpretation, and processing. The lexicon Bran Boguraev (Cambridge Computer Lab &amp; IBM Yorktown Heights) Knowledge of and about words underlies all natural language processing tasks. This tutorial will focus on the complementary questions of content and format(s) of computational lexicons, after looking in some detail at the specific lexical requirements of natural language processing systems. In particular, we will study some recent developments in theories of grammar and lexical semantics, and observe the implications in the way they handle lexical information for the organization of computational lexicons. We will trace, through a number of illustrative examples, issues like formalization of lexical information, flexibility and extendability of lexicon formats, scaling up prototype lexical systems, and acquisition of lexical knowledge, and observe how these inter-relate during the process of designing lexical components for realistic natural language processing systems.</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.996607375">In this talk I would like to address some issues of major importance in lexical semantics. In particular, I will discuss four topics relating to current research in the field: methodology, descriptive coverage, adequacy of the representation, and the computational usefulness of representations. In addressing these issues, I will discuss what I think are some of the central problems facing the lexical semantics community, and suggest ways of best approaching these issues. Finally, I outline a theory of lexical semantics embodying a richer notion of compositionality, termed cocomposition, which aims to spread the semantic load more evenly throughout the lexicon.</abstract>

Thirdly, and related to the point above, the lexicon is not just verbs. Recent work has done much to clarify the nature of verb classes and the syntactic constructions that each allows [Levin, 1985]. Yet it is not clear whether we are any closer to understanding the underlying nature of verb meaning, why the classes develop as they do, and what consequences these distinctions have for the rest of the lexicon and grammar. The curious thing is that there has been little attention paid to the other lexical categories (but see [Fass, 1988]. That is, we have little insight into the semantic nature of adjectival predication, and even less into the semantics of nominals. Not until all major categories have been studied can we hope to arrive at a balanced understanding of the lexicon and the methods of composition. 2. Methods in Lexical Semantics Given what I have said, let us examine the questions presented above in more detail. Because of space, I will have little to say concerning question (4) in this short note. First, let us turn to the issue of methodology. How can we determine the soundness of our method? Are new techniques</context>

This may entail idealizing the notion of lexical meaning away from other semantic influences. For instance, this might suggest that discourse and pragmatic factors should be handled differently or separately from the semantic contributions of lexical items in composition (contra [Hobbs, 1987]. Although this is not a necessary assumption and may in fact be wrong, it may help narrow our focus on what is important for lexical semantic descriptions. Secondly, lexical semantics must look for representations that are richer than thematic role descriptions [Fillmore, 1968]. As argued in [Levin and Rappaport, 1986], named roles are useful, at best, for establishing fairly general mapping strategies to the syntactic structures in language. The distinctions possible with &amp;quot;theta&amp;quot; roles are much too coarse-grained to provide a useful semantic interpretation of a sentence. What is needed, therefore, is a principled method of lexical decomposition. This presupposes, if it is to work at all, (1) a rich, recursive theory of semantic composition, (2) the notion of semantic well-formedness mentioned above, and (3) an appeal to levels of interpretation in the semantics [S</context>

First, the taxonomic descriptions that have been made of verb classes are far superior to the classifications available twenty years ago (see [Levin, 1985] for review). Using mainly the descriptive vocabulary of [Talmy, 1975, 1985] and [Jackendoff, 1983], fine and subtle distinctions are drawn that were impossible to capture in the earlier primitives-approach of [Schank, 1972, 19751 or the frame semantics of [Fillmore, 1968]. There are two problems with the current work, however. Unlike the theories of [Wilks, 19751 and [Quilfian, 1968], there is no general coherent view on what the entire lexicon will look like when semantic structures for other major categories are studied. Furthermore, it is not clear whether this work embodies a real theory of knowledge representation. We can, however, view this research as the first step towards constructing a theory of lexical semantics which is integrated into a linguistic theory, as well as interpreted in a knowledge representation system. 4.

Conventional wisdom on this point paints a picture of words behaving as either active functors or passive arguments [Montague, 1974]. But if we change the way which categories can denote, then the form of compositionality itself changes. Therefore, if done well, lexical semantics forces us to reevaluate the very nature of semantic composition in language (see, for example [Keenan and Faltz, 1985]). In what ways could lexical semantics affect the larger methods of composition in semantics? I mentioned above that most of the careful representation work has been done on verb classes. In fact, the semantic weight in both lexical and compositional terms usually falls on the verb. This has obvious consequences for how to treat lexical ambiguity. For example, consider the verb &amp;quot;bake&amp;quot; in the two sentences below. (1) a. John baked the potato. b. John baked the cake. [Atkins, Kegl, and Levin, 1988] demonstrate that verbs such as &amp;quot;bake&amp;quot; are ambiguous, with both a &amp;quot;change-of-state&amp;quot; sense (la) an</context>
<context position="32957" citStr="Keenan and Faltz, 1985" startWordPosition="5005" endWordPosition="5008">ty suggests that a more general, simpler explanation should be possible. By relaxing the conditions on how the meaning of a complex expression is derived from its parts, we can, in fact, arrive at a very straightforward explanation for cases of &amp;quot;logical polysemy.&amp;quot; The basic idea is this. Rather than treating the expressions that behave as arguments to a function as simple, passive objects, imagine that they are as active in the semantics as the verb itself. The product of function application would be sensitive to both the function and its active argument. Something like this is suggested in [Keenan and Faltz, 19851, as the &amp;quot;Meaning-Form Correlation Principle.&amp;quot; What I have in mind can best be illustrated by returning to the examples in (1). Rather than having two word senses for a verb such as &amp;quot;bake,&amp;quot; suppose there is simply one, a &amp;quot;change-of-state.&amp;quot; Now, assume that &amp;quot;bake&amp;quot; can be lexically specified as a Process verb [Pustejovsky, 19881. It is a general property of Processes, that they can shift their &amp;quot;aspectual type&amp;quot; to become a telic event. For example, &amp;quot;push the wagon&amp;quot; can shift from a Process to a Transition (&amp;quot;push the wagon to Mary&amp;quot;) by general principles of event composition (cf.

Assume further, that our semantic theory makes a logical distinction between &amp;quot;potatoes&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;cakes&amp;quot; in terms of natural versus artifactual objects. Any artifact can be identified with the state of being that object, along with the purpose of the object, and other information. Most importantly, however, an artifact has a </context>

I call this the &amp;quot;Qualia Structure&amp;quot;, adopting a term from [Goodman, 1951]. Essentially, the qualia structure of a noun determines its meaning as much as the list of arguments determines a verb&apos;s meaning. The elements that make up a qualia structure include notions such as &amp;quot;container,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;space,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;surface,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;figure,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;artifact,&amp;quot; and so on. When we combine the qualia structure of a NP with the argument structure of a verb, we begin to see a richer notion of compositionality emerging, one that looks very much like object-oriented approaches to programming [Ingria and Pustejovsky, 1988]. As an example, consider the two senses of &amp;quot;window&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;door&amp;quot; in (7) and (8) below: (7) a. John crawled through the window. b. The window is closed. (8) a. Mary painted the door. b. Mary walked through the door. Each noun appears to have two senses: an object denotation, and a portal denotation. We can characterize the meaning of such &amp;quot;Double Figure Ground&amp;quot; nominals as a three place relation, roughly something like N(Figure,Invert-Figure,Ground), where Figure refers to the artifact itself, Invert-Figure refers to the portal, and Ground is a reference constant.
