Word order and accent placement are the primary
linguistic means to indicate focus/background struc-
tures in German. This paper presents a pipelined ar-
chitecture for the generation of German monologues
with contextually appropriate word order and accent
placements for the realization of focus/background
structures. Our emphasis is on the sentence plan-
ner that extends the respective propositional con-
tents with discourse-relational features and decides
which part will be focused. Such an enriched se-
mantic input for an HPSG-based formulator allows
word order variations and the placement of prenn-
cleus and nucleus accents. Word order is realized
by grammatical competition based on linear prece-
dence (LP) rules which are based on the discourse-
relational features. Accent placement is realized by
a syntax-driven focus principle that determines the
focus exponent and possible bearers of prenuclens
accents within the syntactically realized focus, the
so-called focus domain.
Focus and word order
determination as sentence
planning tasks
This paper addresses aspects of the control of in-
tonation belonging to the area of sentence planning
[Beale et at, 1998: Wanner and Hovy, 1996]. In
many languages, intonation can reflect pragmati-
cally motivated conceptual decisions. In particu-
lar, focus/background structures (FBSs) reflect the
speaker&apos;s beliefs of the listener&apos;s information state.
Since FBSs are realized in German primarily by
word order dependent accent placements, focus plan-
ning and word order determination are subtasks of
sentence planning.
Due to the complex interactions among the vari-
ous subtasks of sentence planning [Iiovy and Wan-

ner, 1996] proposed a blackboard-based sentence
planner instead of a pipelined architecture. How-
ever, we will demonstrate - as a byproduct of our
approach to focus planning - that in some cases the
complexity of interactions can be realized by a tradi-
tional top--down expansion process. The intertwined
clause-internal organization of focus planning and
word order determination for the realization of FBSs
in German is obtainable by hierarchical planning.
In what follows, we will first give examples of the
interplay of focus and word order in German. We
will present the architecture of our NLG system that
realizes FBSs and describe in more detail hierarchi-
cal sentence planning for FBSs. By means of some
examples we are finally showing how word order de-
pendent focus assignment works.
2 The interplay of focus and word
order
The pragmatic function of the FBS is to indicate
to the listener of an utterance that a certain part
of that utterance has been put into the foreground.
The semantic information of this foregrounded part.
has either been selected from a set of alternative
beliefs ascribed to the listener, or it is a revision
of certain beliefs (in case of contrastive focus), or
the focused phrase expresses &apos;new&apos; information the
listener does not know or is not able to infer from
his beliefs [Halliday, 1967].&apos;
In all three cases the focus domain - the sylitact
realization of a focus - contains the so-called focus
exponent, i.e. the hearer of the focal accent which
we are identifying with the obligatory nucleus ac-
cent. The existence of this accent indicates to the
listener that one part of the message conveys one
of these three functions. In addition to the nucleus
accent optional prenucleus accents can exist as well
which do not have a discourse function in general.
This list of apparently diverse functions shows t hat. there
are possibly several phenomena which have been labeled as
&apos;focus&apos; within the last 70 years or so. There is an ongoing
discussion in the linguistic community whether these three
functions call he traced back to one common principle (cf.
[tichwarzschild. 1009]).

but a prosodic function which goes back to diverse
planning phenomena.
Three examples shall demonstrate the interplay of
word order with accent placement. Example (3) is
from our speech corpus of retellings of a trick film we
analyzed to obtain rules for accent placement. The
other examples are variations of (3) showing that dif-
ferent word order and accent placement correspond
to different focus domains. For reasons of simplicity
we are abstracting from specific pitch accents in this
paper. Accent bearers are given in capitals. Fur-
thermore, the examples do not exhibit prenucleus
accents. However, our rules for accent placement
account for these accents as well. The reason is that
prenucleus accents are determinable if the bearer of
the nucleus accent is known.

Semanticians pointed out that the key concept for
word order and its consequences for accent place-
ment is contextual boundedness (see, e.g., Packend-
off, 1972; Rooth, 1992]). However, their method
to simulate the different contexts by questions the
sentence is able to answer tells us only something
about the number of possible foci. For example,
sentence (1) is able to answer five possible questions,
depending on which constituent provides the answer
(the contexts range from Which specific plateau is he
falling down to? with focus on the compound only to
What&apos;s up?, focusing the whole sentence). Example
(2), however, with the locative PP in sentence-initial
position but identical accent placement is only able
to answer three questions. Hence, (2) is contextu-
ally more hounded than (1). Example (3) exhibiting
an extraposed unit clearly demonstrates the need for
an FBS-&apos;related word order. Extrapositions are the
linguistic means in German to separate sense units.
The extraposition is used to mark two informational
units: first, the person is falling down and second
that the resulting place is the stone plateau. Since
informational units coincide with prosodic phrases,
each phrase contains one nucleus accent so that two
separate focus domains exist.
From an NLG perspective explaining word order
and accent placement by the possibility to answer
context questions points to the wrong direction. Nei-
ther should we generate isolated sentences nor are
we interested in focus ambiguities. Rather we have
to determine a certain word order with a twofold
purpose: first, it must be able to express a planned
focus and second. it should guarantee coherence of
the text.
To our knowledge, the problem of how word or-
.der and-focal: dom ainfdet erniinat ion:interact. has not
been adressed in NLG research yet. The SYNPI-101,1-
ICS formulator [Abb et ai., 1995] that is able to gen-
erate German single sentences-.with FBSs does not
take into account the interplay between word order
and accent placement. Instead word order is deter-
mined by incremental syntactic construction; situa-
tive factors have not been addressed in this system.
The SPEAK! system [Teich et at., 1997] also does not
. account_for the interplay of word order with. accent
placement. However, this system cannot be directly
compared with our approach, since the coverage of
phonological phenomena is completely different: We
are interested in FBSs in monologues, whereas the
SPEAK! system primarily accounts for the role of a
dialogue history to achieve the assignment of various
intonation patterns.
Generally, the realized word order of an utter-
ance is the result of its embedding into the situa-
tive context, which finds expression in the use of
linear precedence (LP) rules for word order determi-
nation during surface realization. The idea is that
constituents are ordered with respect to preferential
properties expressed by these LP-rules. From an
NLG perspective the question is, then, where the
information comes from that allows us to make use
of these LP-rules? In our approach we derive the
information necessary for the use of LP-rules from
a discourse model that relates various aspects of a
discourse to one another. Since we are generating
monologues only the utterances previously produced
by the program require consideration.
The generation of monologues with appropriate
word order and focus/background structures com-
prises five major tasks:

1. The information to be conveyed must be se-
lected and linearized by a content planner.

The five tasks mentioned above are realized in our
NLG system Foes.&apos; Currently the system generates
brief retellings of a trick film with each sentence hav-
ing a contextually appropriate word order and focus-
relevant prosody with the context provided by the
discourse model. Figure (1) shows the architecture
of the system. Sentence planning takes into consid-
eration the current state of a discourse model. When
constructing the input for the formulator, the dis-
course model will be continuously updated so that
the word order of the currently planned sentence is
coherent with the word order of the preceding sen-
tence. Word order relevant information is encoded
by discourse relational features of discourse refer-
ents.
The HPSG-based formulator realizing the sen-
tences uses weighted LP-rules for word order de-
termination that take into account the discourse-
relational features in the semantic input. Bearers of
(pre)nucleus accents within focus domains are deter-
mined by a focus principle.

The planning operators creating the input for the
formulator cause the transition to new states of the
discourse model. The initial state of the discourse
model is characterized by the lack of any information
on the events to be conveyed. Correspondingly in
the goal state all events are represented.
Our discourse model is a knowledge store consist-
ing of two major registers. It consists of a Discourse
Representation Structure (DRS. cf. [Ramp and
Reyle, 1093]) R. K) with sets of mutually known
discourse referents R and DRS-conditions K, and a
set Ref of referential movements assigned to the dis-
course referents. Referential movements determine
how discourse referents arepassed on from one sen-
tence to the next one. R is a pair (RA, RN) consist-
ing of referents of the directly preceding utterance
and referents of all.other .previous utterances. Since
referential movements are typically finked with idea-
tifiability conditions for discourse referents, the lat-
ter can be derived from the former. New referents
are declared as being unidentifiable for the listener.

while re-established ones should typically be identi-
fiable by a definite description. Maintained referents
are usually anaphorically identifiable. Furthermore,
alternative sets AU are determined by sortal restric-
tions. Discourse referents function as alternatives if
they are stored in the discourse model in R and are
instances of the same superordinated concept. Anal-
ogously, concepts are alternatives if they are stored
in the discourse model in K and possess the same
directly superordinated concept. During planning
the discourse model will be continuously updated.
Updating comprises the insertion of new discourse
referents into RA, shifting referents from PA to RA.
and, in case of referential re-establishment, shifting
referents from RN to RA. Furthermore, new PBS
conditions will be introduced into K, and the ref-
erential movement conditions are updated. resulting
also in new alternative sets and identifiability con-

<bodyText confidence="0.997309041666667">
Extending the propositions by..discourse-relationai-
features makes intensive use of the discourse model.
Three discourse relational .factors influencing word
order are realized as plan operators: topic assign-
ment, referential movement, and identifiability of
discourse referents by the listener.
Topic assignment: Topics establish an
aboutness-relation between a familiar discourse
referent and the sentential predication. We adopt
the conditions for topic---assignment.TropoSed -in-
[Klabunde and Jansche, 1998]. Topic candidates
must be identifiable discourse referents and they
should be as high on a so-called topic acceptance
scale as possible. According to such a scale referents
that are currently lit up constitute the best topic
candidates. In our approach, these are referents
from the intersection of RA and the referents of
the current event proposition to be realized. The
topic acceptance scale is mirrored in the successive
application of operators for topic assignment. For
example, if several referents as candidates exist,
a discourse referent will be chosen that is marked
as anaphorically identifiable and referentially
maintained:

The LP-rule referring to topic assignment is topic
&lt; focus, i.e. topics should precede foci.
Referential movement: Referential movement
comprises the picking up of discourse referents from
previously uttered information and the introduc-
tion of new referents, respectively. If referents
from the directly preceding utterance are picked up,
these referents are maintained. Referents from all
other previous utterances are re-established. Ref-
erential movement: influences word order because
maintained referents are usually realized before re-
established ones, and re-established ones precede
new referents, as indicated by the following LP-rule:

4.2 Focus and background determination
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999989290322581">
We &apos;already pointed-on t that.focusing-a semantic rep- •
resentation is based on one of three functions: the
selection of beliefs from a set of alternatives, con-
trasting a belief with a different one, and indicating
new information. These three functions have also
been verified in our corpus of story tellings. Each of
these functions has been treated separately in vari-
ous systems (see, e.g., [Prevost and Steedman, 1993]
for contrastive focus in a concept-to-speech system,
.[Theune ..et ,...1997]. for new :information in a data--
to-speech system, and [Blok and Eberle, 1999] for
alternative semantics in machine translation), but
a single and comprehensive approach has not been
proposed yet. However, structure and content of
our discourse model allow us to determine EBSs by
means of planning operators as well. Different pre-
conditions for the focus determining operator result
in the successive check whether one of these three
functions is satisfied. First it is checked whether the
proposition to be conveyed contains any informa-
tion that is new for the listener. New information
is what is not stored in the DRS K of the discourse
mode1.3 If these preconditions are not satisfied it is
checked whether parts of the proposition belong to
alternatives presumed by the listener. Only if these
preconditions fail a contrasting focus is realizable.
Contrasting focus is realized if some property in K
of an activated discourse referent in RA contradicts
a property in the semantic input under considera-
tion, provided the same sortal restriction holds as
for the alternatives.

competition

<bodyText confidence="0.8921911">
The resulting input for grammatical competition is
a blend of semantic and pragmatic information. For
example, the input for realizing example (1) is as
follows:
locus: [-f al lingDown(e ,m) , into Ce ,$) , stonelateau (s) ,
definiteid(s), reflieRstablishment(s)]
ground: Emain(ro), anaphic“to) , refhtaintenance(m),
topic (m)]
The constants m, s, and e are referents for a spe-
cific man, stone plateau, and the event of falling
down. The values of the features focus and ground
represent the focused part of the proposition and
-the background, respectively. While -the realization
of the focus domain is the task of converting the
complete focus into one phrase, word order will be
determined by LP-rules that pick up the pragmati-
cally motivated literals on topichood,
and referential movement_

As already mentioned, the notion of grammati-
cal competition is. necessary to acco.unt. for the in-
teraction of syntactic and phonological constraints
on focus/background structures. The idea to use
a competition model to explain word order varia-
tions in German is not new (cf. [Steinberger, 1994;
Uszkoreit, 19871). The advantage of grammatical
competition compared to a non-competitive use of
precedence rules (as in standard HPSG) is its flex-
ibility. A competition model allows to take syntac-
tic as well as semantic and pragmatic preferences
into consideration, and to-determine-the acceptabil-
ity of a sentence with respect to the situative con-
text. The usual approach is to formulate preference
rules which have a certain impact on the naturalness
or constituent orders. Some of these preference rules
are stronger than others. The number of preference
rules which are satisfied or violated, in combination
with the relative importance of the different factors,
is responsible for the varying degree of naturalness
of word order variations. Analogously to this idea
we use weighted LP-rules as well which are based
on the planned discourse-relational features.
Focus domains are realized by means of a focus
principle. Applying the focus principle results in
the projection of a focus feature to the dominating
node. Together with the standard HPSG-principles
the focus principle confines the successive applica-
tion of the head-complement, head-filler, and head-
adjunct schemata to two lemmas in order to build
up phrases and sentences. The focus principle con-
strains the placement of prenucleus and nucleus ac-
cents in view of the syntactic status of the phrasal
signs. It is based on the following empirically vali-
dated regularities with respect to the placement or
the nucleus and prenucleus accents:
1. in phrases with a head-daughter and adjunct-
daughter the focus exponent is in the head-
daughter and a prenucleus accent is in the
adjunct-daughter.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.880951625">
2 for phrases with a head-daughter
complement-daughter holds:
(a) if the head daughter is a verbal projec-
tion, the focus exponent is in the head-
daughter and a prenucleus accent is in the
complement-daughter.
(b) else the accents are in the complement--
daughter.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999919710526316">
The regularities underlying the nucleus and prenti-
dens accent placement have hero formulated on the
basis of an analysis of a story telling corpus. The
tellings have been analyzed w.r.t. the position of
pitch accents :incl their indication of possible fo-
cus iftnitairis. Two results of this analysis shall he
mentioned here: First. the analysis showed that the
overwhelming number of focus domain determina-
tion can he explained. by .syntax-based projection
rules (see, e.g., [Gunther, 1999; Ladd, 1996] for some
proposals) underlying our focus principle. Second,
given the three basic pragmatic functions of FBSs,
primarily information that was new to the listener -
has been accented. Contrastiveness was confined to
focal accents on certain closed-class items such as
determiners.4
While focus domains- are realized by a syntactic
principle, word order will be realized by means of
weighted -LP-rules. Since especially the LP--rule
topic &lt; focus requires information on focused con-
stituents focus determination must be completed be-
fore word order will be realized. We introduced the
necessary LP-rules in section 4.1.
Based on these LP-rules word order will be deter-
mined by means of the operation of domain union
proposed in [Reape, 1994]. If the head or the daugh-
ter is a verbal projection the domain of the phrase
will be received by domain union. Verbal projec-
tions are of interest for word order realization be-
cause only in this case the LP-rules will be evalu-
ated. Otherwise the domains will be combined ac-
cording to the directionality feature DIR of the head
and a MOD-DIR feature of an adjunct. The for-
mer determines the order of head and complement,
while the latter is responsible for the order of ad-
juncts and their modified element, Since in this case
no LP-rules have to be evaluated, word order deter-
mination is a trivial task.

The operator for topic assignment marks s as
sentence topic because it is the currently best
available topic according to the topic acceptance
scale. Referential movement is as follows: since s
has been declared in the discourse model as being
referentially maintained, it will be maintained in the
first utterance as well. Discourse referent in was re-
established and, therefore, will become referentially
maintained. Since referent s was identifiable by a
definite description for the listener and is the topic,
it remains identifiable by definite means, resulting in
a definite NP. Referent in was identifiable by definite
means and becomes auaphorically identifiable.
Focus and background are determined as follows:
first it is checked whether any information in the
proposition is new to the listener. Since all liter-
als from the propositional content also exist in K,
nothing can be focused due to being &apos;new&apos; informa-
tion. However, there are two literals in the propo-
sitional content with explicitly represented alterna-
tives. Since both literals can be linguistically real-
ized as one constituent (as a PP), only one focus
domain and one focus exponent will appear.
The resulting utterance is in die STEINebene fdllt
er router with the locative PP in clause-initial posi-
tion and accent on the noun-noun compound. The
PP has been fronted because it receives the best eval-
uation vv.r.t. the three discourse-relational features.
The compound functions as focus exponent because
the whole PP constitutes the focus domain, which is
managed by the focus principle.

erated by FOGS are given below. Note that the single
sentences always express the same respective propo-
sitional content. What differs are the word order
and/or the position of the nucleus accent. These dif-
ferences in word order and accent placement are due
to the varying content of the discourse model, the
different possibilities for focus determination, and
the effects of the applicable planning operators for
referential movement, topic assignment, and identi-
fiability.

While hierarchical planning of discourse relational
features for the use of LP-rules during surface real-
ization seems to be a promising approach for word
order dependent focus/background determination,
additional constraints on word order are required
to block overgeneration. The three LP-rules6 are
necessary, but no sufficient means to determine free
word order in general. Next to these discourse-
related rules there are syntactic and semantic re-
strictions on word order as well. However, due to
their discourse-related nature, the conditions for us-
ing our LP-rules can be derived from the- discourse
model. Syntactic and semantic constraints on word
order do not require a discourse model.
To summarize, the combination of hierarchical
content planning with grammatical competition in
view of a focus principle seems to be a promising
approach for focus/background determination.

This paper presents a pipelined architecture for the generation of German monologues contextually appropriate word order placements for the realization of focus/background structures. Our emphasis is on the sentence planner that extends the respective propositional contents with discourse-relational features and decides which part will be focused. Such an enriched semantic input for an HPSG-based formulator allows word order variations and the placement of prenncleus and nucleus accents. Word order is realized by grammatical competition based on linear precewhich are based on the discourserelational features. Accent placement is realized by syntax-driven focus principle that the exponent and possible prenuclens accents within the syntactically realized focus, the so-called focus domain. Focus and word order determination as sentence planning tasks This paper addresses aspects of the control of intonation belonging to the area of sentence planning 1998: Wanner and Hovy, 1996]. In many languages, intonation can reflect pragmatically motivated conceptual decisions. In particular, focus/background structures (FBSs) reflect the speaker&apos;s beliefs of the listener&apos;s information state. Since FBSs are realized in German primarily by dependent accent placements, planword order determination are subtasks sentence planning. Due to the complex interactions among the variof sentence planning [Iiovy and Wanresearch reported in this paper is funded by the (German Science Foundation) in the priority program &apos;lanander grant lie 1467/3-1.

We present the architecture of our NLG system realizes FBSs and describe in more detail hierarchisentence planning for FBSs. By means examples we are finally showing how word order dependent focus assignment works. The interplay of focus and order pragmatic function of is to indicate to the listener of an utterance that a certain part of that utterance has been put into the foreground. The semantic information of this foregrounded part. has either been selected from a set of alternative ascribed to the listener, or it is of certain beliefs (in case of contrastive focus), or focused phrase expresses &apos;new&apos; the listener does not know or is not able to infer from his beliefs [Halliday, 1967].&apos; In all three cases the focus domain the sylitact realization of a focus contains the so-called focus exponent, i.e. the hearer of the focal accent which we are identifying with the obligatory nucleus ac- The existence of this accent indicates to listener that one part of the message conveys one functions.

Example (3) is from our speech corpus of retellings of a trick film we analyzed to obtain rules for accent placement. The other examples are variations of (3) showing that different word order and accent placement correspond to different focus domains. For reasons of simplicity we are abstracting from specific pitch accents in this paper. Accent bearers are given in capitals. Furthermore, the examples do not exhibit prenucleus accents. However, our rules for accent placement account for these accents as well. The reason is that prenucleus accents are determinable if the bearer of the nucleus accent is known. er fallt STEINebene he falls in the stone plateau down &apos;he is falling down to the stone plateau&apos; in STEINebene Mit er fella RUNter STEINebene Semanticians pointed out that the key concept for word order and its consequences for accent placement is contextual boundedness (see, e.g., Packendoff, 1972; Rooth, 1992]). However, their method to simulate the different contexts by questions the sentence is able to answer tells us only something about the number of possible foci. For example, sentence (1) is able to answer five possible questions, which constituent the answer contexts range from specific plateau is he down to? focus on the compound only to up?, the sentence). Example with the locative PP in sentence-initial position but identical accent placement is only able to answer three questions. Hence, (2) is contextumore than (1). (3) clearly demonstrates need for word order. Extrapositions are the linguistic means in German to separate sense units. The extraposition is used to mark two informational first, the person is and second the is the stone plateau. Since informational units coincide with prosodic phrases, each phrase contains one nucleus accent so that two separate focus domains exist. From an NLG perspective explaining word order accent placement by possibility to answer points to the Neither should we generate isolated sentences nor are focus ambiguities. Rather we have to determine a certain word order with a twofold purpose: first, it must be able to express a planned focus and second. it should guarantee coherence of the text. knowledge, the problem of how word orand-focal: dom ainfdet erniinat not adressed in NLG research yet.

The idea is that constituents are ordered with respect to preferential properties expressed by these LP-rules. From an perspective the question is, where information comes from that allows us to make use of these LP-rules? In our approach we derive the information necessary for the use of LP-rules from a discourse model that relates various aspects of a discourse to one another. Since we are generating only the utterances previously by the program require consideration. generation monologues with appropriate word order and focus/background structures comprises five major tasks: information to be conveyed must be selinearized by a content 2.

The result of sentence planning functions .as input for a competition-based formulator. In order to demonstrate how the formulator is able to realize FBSs by means of grammatical competition, we will also outline the determination of focus domains, word order, and accent bearers in focus domains (tasks 3a and 3b). 3 Architecture of FOGS The five tasks mentioned above are realized in our NLG system Foes.&apos; Currently the system generates brief retellings of a trick film with each sentence having a contextually appropriate word order and focusrelevant prosody with the context provided by the discourse model. Figure (1) shows the architecture of the system. Sentence planning takes into consideration the current state of a discourse model. When constructing the input for the formulator, the discourse model will be continuously updated so that the word order of the currently planned sentence is coherent with the word order of the preceding sentence. Word order relevant information is encoded by discourse relational features of discourse referents. The HPSG-based formulator realizing the sentences uses weighted LP-rules for word order determination that take into account the discourserelational features in the semantic input. Bearers of (pre)nucleus accents within focus domains are determined by a focus principle. 4 Sentence planning in FOGS The planning operators creating the input for the formulator cause the transition to new states of the discourse model. The initial state of the discourse model is characterized by the lack of any information on the events to be conveyed. Correspondingly in goal all events are represented. discourse model is a store consisting of two major registers. It consists of a Discourse Structure (DRS. cf.

Three discourse relational .factors influencing word order are realized as plan operators: topic assignment, referential movement, and identifiability of discourse referents by the listener. Topic assignment: Topics establish an aboutness-relation between a familiar discourse referent and the sentential predication. We adopt the conditions for topic---assignment.TropoSed -in[Klabunde and Jansche, 1998]. Topic candidates must be identifiable discourse referents and they should be as high on a so-called topic acceptance scale as possible. According to such a scale referents that are currently lit up constitute the best topic candidates. In our approach, these are referents from the intersection of RA and the referents of the current event proposition to be realized. The topic acceptance scale is mirrored in the successive application of operators for topic assignment.

These three functions have also been verified in our corpus of story tellings. Each of these functions has been treated separately in various systems (see, e.g., [Prevost and Steedman, 1993] for contrastive focus in a concept-to-speech system, .[Theune ..et ,...1997]. for new :information in a data-- to-speech system, and [Blok and Eberle, 1999] for alternative semantics in machine translation), but a single and comprehensive approach has not been proposed yet. However, structure and content of our discourse model allow us to determine EBSs by means of planning operators as well. Different preconditions for the focus determining operator result in the successive check whether one of these three functions is satisfied. First it is checked whether the proposition to be conveyed co</context>

Contrastiveness was confined to focal accents on certain closed-class items such as determiners.4 While focus domains- are realized by a syntactic principle, word order will be realized by means of weighted -LP-rules. Since especially the LP--rule topic &lt; focus requires information on focused constituents focus determination must be completed before word order will be realized. We introduced the necessary LP-rules in section 4.1. Based on these LP-rules word order will be determined by means of the operation of domain union proposed in [Reape, 1994]. If the head or the daughter is a verbal projection the domain of the phrase will be received by domain union. Verbal projections are of interest for word order realization because only in this case the LP-rules will be evaluated. Otherwise the domains will be combined according to the directionality feature DIR of the head and a MOD-DIR feature of an adjunct. The former determines the order of head and complement, while the latter is responsible for the order of adjuncts and their modified element, Since in this case no LP-rules have to be evaluated, word order determination is a trivial ta</context>

However, our rules for accent placement account for these accents as well. The reason is that prenucleus accents are determinable if the bearer of the nucleus accent is known. 1. er fallt in die STEINebene runter he falls in the stone plateau down &apos;he is falling down to the stone plateau&apos; 2. in die STEINebene Mit er router 3_ er fella RUNter in die STEINebene Semanticians pointed out that the key concept for word order and its consequences for accent placement is contextual boundedness (see, e.g., Packendoff, 1972; Rooth, 1992]). However, their method to simulate the different contexts by questions the sentence is able to answer tells us only something about the number of possible foci. For example, sentence (1) is able to answer five possible questions, depending on which constituent provides the answer (the contexts range from Which specific plateau is he falling down to? with focus on the compound only to What&apos;s up?, focusing the whole sentence). Example (2), however, with the locative PP in sentence-initial position but identical accent placement is only able to answer three questions. Hence, (2) is contextuall</context>
