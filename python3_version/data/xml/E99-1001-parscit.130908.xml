It is often claimed that Named En-
tity recognition systems need extensive
gazetteersâ€”lists of names of people, or-
ganisations, locations, and other named
entities. Indeed, the compilation of such
gazetteers is sometimes mentioned as a
bottleneck in the design of Named En-
tity recognition systems.
We report on a Named Entity recogni-
tion system which combines rule-based
grammars with statistical (maximum en-
tropy) models. We report on the sys-
tem&apos;s performance with gazetteers of dif-
ferent types and different sizes, using test
material from the muc-7 competition.
We show that, for the text type and task
of this competition, it is sufficient to use
relatively small gazetteers of well-known
names, rather than large gazetteers of
low-frequency names. We conclude with
observations about the domain indepen-
dence of the competition and of our ex-
periments.

Named Entity recognition involves processing a
text and identifying certain occurrences of words
or expressions as belonging to particular cate-
gories of Named Entities (NE). NE recognition
software serves as an important preprocessing tool
for tasks such as information extraction, informa-
tion retrieval and other text processing applica-
tions.
What counts as a Named Entity depends on
the application that makes use of the annotations.
One such application is document retrieval or au-
tomated document forwarding: documents an-
noted with NE information can be searched more
Now also at Harlequin Ltd. (Edinburgh office)
accurately than raw text. For example, NE an-
notation allows you to search for all texts that
mention the company &amp;quot;Philip Morris&amp;quot;, ignoring
documents about a possibly unrelated person by
the same name. Or you can have all documents
forwarded to you about a person called &amp;quot;Gates&amp;quot;,
without receiving documents about things called
gates. In a document collection annotated with
Named Entity information you can more easily
find documents about Java the programming lan-
guage without getting documents about Java the
country or Java the coffee.
Most common among marked categories are
names of people, organisations and locations as
well as temporal and numeric expression. Here
is an example of a text marked up with Named
Entity information:
&lt;ENAMEX TYPE=&apos;PERSON&apos;&gt;Flavel
Donne&lt;/ENAMEX&gt; is an analyst with &lt;ENAMEX
TYPE=&apos;ORGANIZATION&apos;&gt;General Trends
&lt;/ENAMEX&gt;, which has been based in &lt;ENAMEX
TYPE=&apos;LOCATION&apos;&gt;Little Spring&lt;/ENAMEX&gt; since
&lt;TIMEX TYPE=&apos;DATE&apos;&gt;July 1998&lt;/TIMEX&gt;.
In an article on the Named Entity recognition
competition (part of muc-6) Sundheim (1995) re-
marks that &amp;quot;common organization names, first
names of people and location names can be han-
dled by recourse to list lookup, although there are
drawbacks&amp;quot; (Sundheim 1995: 16). In fact, par-
ticipants in that competition from the Univer-
sity of Durham (Morgan et al., 1995) and from
SRA (Krupka, 1995) report that gazetteers did
not make that much of a difference to their sys-
tem. Nevertheless, in a recent article Cucchiarelli
et al. (1998) report that one of the bottlenecks
in designing NE recognition systems is the lim-
ited availability of large gazetteers, particularly
gazetteers for different languages (Cucchiarelli et
al. 1998: 291). People also use gazetteers of very
different sizes. The basic gazetteers in the Iso-
quest system for muc-7 contain 110,000 names,
but Krupka and Hausman (1998) show that sys-
tem performance does not degrade much when the

gazetteers are reduced to 25,000 and 9,000 names;
conversely, they also show that the addition of an
extra 42 entries to the gazetteers improves perfor-
mance dramatically.
This raises several questions: how important
are gazetteers? is it important that they are big?
if gazetteers are important but their size isn&apos;t,
then what are the criteria for building gazetteers?
One might think that Named Entity recognition
could be done by using lists of (e.g.) names of peo-
ple, places and organisations, but that is not the
case. To begin with, the lists would be huge: it
is estimated that there are 1.5 million unique sur-
names just in the U.S. It is not feasible to list all
possible surnames in the world in a Named Entity
recognition system. There is a similar problem
with company names. A list of all current compa-
nies worldwide would be huge, if at all available,
and would immediately be out of date since new
companies are formed all the time. In addition,
company names can occur in variations: a list of
company names might contain &amp;quot;The Royal Bank
of Scotland plc&amp;quot;, but that company might also
be referred to as &amp;quot;The Royal Bank of Scotland&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;The Royal&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;The Royal plc&amp;quot;. These variations
would all have to be listed as well.
Even if it was possible to list all possible or-
ganisations and locations and people, there would
still be the problem of overlaps between the lists.
Names such as Emerson or Washington could be
names of people as well as places; Philip Morris
could be a person or an organisation. In addition,
such lists would also contain words like &amp;quot;Hope&amp;quot;
and &amp;quot;Lost&amp;quot; (locations) and &amp;quot;Thinking Machines&amp;quot;
and &amp;quot;Next&amp;quot; (companies), whereas these words
could also occur in contexts where they don&apos;t refer
to named entities.
Moreover, names of companies can be complex
entities, consisting of several words. Especially
where conjunctions are involved, this can create
problems. In &amp;quot;China International Trust and In-
vestment Corp decided to do something&amp;quot;, it&apos;s not
obvious whether there is a reference here to one
company or two. In the sentence &amp;quot;Mason, Daily
and Partners lost their court case&amp;quot; it is clear that
&amp;quot;Mason, Daily and Partners&amp;quot; is the name of a
company. In the sentence &amp;quot;Unfortunately, Daily
and Partners lost their court case&amp;quot; the name of the
company does not include the word &amp;quot;unfortunate-
ly&amp;quot;, but it still includes the word &amp;quot;Daily&amp;quot;, which
is just as common a word as &amp;quot;unfortunately&amp;quot;.
In this paper we report on a Named Entity
recognition system which was amongst the highest
scoring in the recent MUC-7 Message Understand-
ing Conference/Competition (MUC). One of the
features of our system is that even when it is run
without any lists of names of organisations or peo-
ple it still performs at a level comparable to that of
many other MU C-systems. We report on exper-
iments which show the difference in performance
between the NE system with gazetteers of differ-
ent sizes for three types of named entities: people,
organisations and locations.

2 The MUC Competition
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994152076923077">
The muc competition for which we built our sys-
tem took place in March 1998. Prior to the com-
petition, participants received a detailed coding
manual which specified what should and should
not be marked up, and how the markup should
proceed. They also received a few hundred arti-
cles from the New York Times Service, marked
up by the organisers according to the rules of the
coding manual.
For the competition itself, participants received
100 articles. They then had 5 days to perform the
chosen information extraction tasks (in our case:
Named Entity recognition) without human inter-
vention, and markup the text with the Named En-
tities found. The resulting marked up file then had
to be returned to the organisers for scoring.
Scoring of the results is done automatically by
the organisers. The scoring software compares a
participant&apos;s answer file against a carefully pre-
pared key file; the key file is considered to be the
&amp;quot;correctly&amp;quot; annotated file. Amongst many other
things, the scoring software calculates a system&apos;s
recall and precision scores:
Recall: Number of correct tags in the answer file
over total number of tags in the key file.
Precision: Number of correct tags in the answer
file over total number of tags in the answer
file.
Recall and precision are generally accepted ways
of measuring system performance in this field. For
example, suppose you have a text which is 1000
words long, and 20 of these words express a lo-
cation. Now imagine a system which assigns the
LOCATION tag to every single word in the text.
This system will have tagged correctly all 20 lo-
cations, since it tagged everything as LOCATION;
its recall score is 20/20, or 100%. But of the 1000
LOCATION tags it assigned, only those 20 were cor-
rect; its precision is therefore only 20/1000, or 2%.

3.1 A simple system
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999894">
We decided first to test to what extent NE recog-
nition can be carried out merely by recourse to list
lookup. Such a system could be domain and lan-
guage independent. It would need no grammars
or even information about tokenization but simply
mark up known strings in the text. Of course, the
development and maintenance of the name lists
would become more labour intensive.
(Palmer and Day, 1997) evaluated the perfor-
mance of such a minimal NE recognition system
equipped with name lists derived from muc-6
training texts. The system was tested on news-
wire texts for six languages. It achieved a recall
rate of about 70% for Chinese, Japanese and Por-
tuguese and about 40% for English and French.
The precision of the system was not calculated
but can be assumed to be quite high because it
would only be affected by cases where a capitalized
word occurs in more than one list (e.g. &amp;quot;Columbi-
a&amp;quot; could occur in the list of organisations as well as
locations) or where a capitalised word occurs in a
list but could also be something completely differ-
ent (e.g. &amp;quot;Columbia&amp;quot; occurs in the list of locations
but could also be the name of a space shuttle).
We trained a similar minimal system using the
muc- 7 training data (200 articles) and ran it on
the test data set (100 articles). The corpus we
used in our experiments were the training and test
corpora for the mUC- 7 evaluation.
From the training data we collected 1228 person
names, 809 names of organizations and 770 names
of locations. The resulting name lists were the
only resource used by the minimal NE recognition
system. It nevertheless achieved relatively high
precision (around 90%) and recall in the range 40-
70%. The results are summarised in Figure 1 in
the &amp;quot;learned lists&amp;quot; column.
Despite its simplicity, this type of system does
presuppose the existence of training texts, and
these are not always available. To cope with
the absence of training material we designed and
tested another variation of the minimal system.
Instead of collecting lists from training texts we in-
stead collected lists of commonly known entitiesâ€”
we collected a list of 5000 locations (countries and
American states with their five biggest cities) from
the CIA World Fact Book, a list of 33,000 orga-
nization names (companies, banks, associations,
universities, etc.) from financial Web sites, and a
list of 27,000 famous people from several websites.
The results of this run can be seen in Figure 1 in
the &amp;quot;common lists&amp;quot; column. In essence, this sys-
tem&apos;s performance was comparable to that of the
system using lists from the training set as far as lo-
cation was concerned; it performed slightly worse
on the person category and performed badly on
organisations.
In a final experiment we combined the two
gazetteers, the one induced from the training texts
with the one acquired from public resources, and
achieved some improvement in recall at the ex-
pense of precision. The results of this test run are
given in the &amp;quot;combined lists&amp;quot; column in Figure 1.
We can conclude that the pure list lookup
approach performs reasonably well for locations
(precision of 90-94%; recall of 75-85%). For the
person category and especially for the organiza-
tion category this approach does not yield good
performance: although the precision was not ex-
tremely bad (around 75-85%), recall was too low
(lower than 50%)â€”i.e. every second person name
or organization failed to be assigned.
For document retrieval purposes low recall is
not necessarily a major problem since it is often
sufficient to recognize just one occurrence of each
distinctive entity per document, and many of the
unassigned person and organization names were
just repetitions of their full variants. But for many
other applications, and for the muc competition,
higher recall and precision are necessary.

The system we fielded for muc-7 makes exten-

string of words like &amp;quot;Adam Kluver&amp;quot; has an inter-
nal (phrasal) structure which suggests that this
is a person name; but we know that it can also
be used as a shortcut for a name of organization
(&amp;quot;Adam Kluver Ltd.&amp;quot;) or location (&amp;quot;Adam Klu-
ver Country Park&amp;quot;). Looking it up on a list will
not necessarily help: the string may not be on
a list, may be on more than one list, or may be
on the wrong list. However, somewhere in the
text, there is likely to be some contextual material
which makes it clear what type of named entity it
is. Our strategy is to only make a decision once we
have identified this bit of contextual information.
We further assume that, once we have identi-
fied contextual material which makes it clear that
&amp;quot;Adam Kluver&amp;quot; is (e.g.) the name of a company,
then any other mention of &amp;quot;Adam Kluver&amp;quot; in that
document is likely to refer to that company. If the
author at some point in the same text also wants
to refer to (e.g.) a person called &amp;quot;Adam Kluver&amp;quot;,
s/he will provide some extra context to make this
clear, and this context will be picked up in the first
step. The fact that at first it is only an assump-
tion rather than a certainty that &amp;quot;Adam Kluver&amp;quot;
is a company, is represented explicitly, and later
processing components try to resolve the uncer-
tainty.
If no suitable context is found anywhere in the
text to decide what sort of Named Entity &amp;quot;Adam
Kluver&amp;quot; is, the system can check other resources,
e.g. a list of known company names and apply
compositional phrasal grammars for different cat-
egories. Such grammars for instance can state
that if a sequence of capitalized words ends with
the word &amp;quot;Ltd.&amp;quot; it is a name of organization or
if a known first name is followed by an unknown
capitalized word this is a person name.
In our muc system, we implemented this ap-
proach as a staged combination of a rule-based
system with probabilistic partial matching. We
describe each stage in turn.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.953737">
3.3 Step 1. Sure-fire Rules
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99954471875">
In the first step, the system applies sure-fire gram-
mar rules. These rules combine internal and ex-
ternal evidence, and only fire when a possible can-
didate expression is surrounded by a suggestive
context. Sure-fire rules rely on known corporate
designators (Ltd., Inc., etc.), person titles (Mr.,
Dr., Sen.), and definite contexts such as those
in Figure 2. The sure-fire rules apply after POS
tagging and simple semantic tagging, so at this
stage words like &amp;quot;former&amp;quot; have already been iden-
tified as JJ (adjective), words like &amp;quot;analyst&amp;quot; have
been identified as PROF (professions), and words
like &amp;quot;brother&amp;quot; as REL (relatives).
At this stage our muc system treats informa-
tion from the lists as likely rather than definite
and always checks if the context is either sugges-
tive or non-contradictive. For example, a likely
company name with a conjunction (e.g. &amp;quot;China
International Trust and Investment Corp&amp;quot;) is left
untagged at this stage if the company is not listed
in a list of known companies. Similarly, the system
postpones the markup of unknown organizations
whose name starts with a sentence initial common
word, as in &amp;quot;Suspended Ceiling Contractors Ltd
denied the charge&amp;quot;.
Names of possible locations found in our
gazetteer of place names are marked as LOCATION
only if they appear with a context that is sugges-
tive of location. &amp;quot;Washington&amp;quot;, for example, can
just as easily be a surname or the name of an or-
ganization. Only in a suggestive context, like &amp;quot;in
Washington&amp;quot;, will it be marked up as location.

3.4 Step 2. Partial Match 1
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9935105">
After the sure-fire symbolic transduction the sys-
tem performs a probabilistic partial match of the
identified entities. First, the system collects all
named entities already identified in the document.

It then generates all possible partial orders of
the composing words preserving their order, and
marks them if found elsewhere in the text. For
instance, if &amp;quot;Adam Kluver Ltd&amp;quot; had already been
recognised as an organisation by the sure-fire rule,
in this second step any occurrences of &amp;quot;Kluver
Ltd&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Adam Ltd&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Adam Kluver&amp;quot; are also
tagged as possible organizations. This assignment,
however, is not definite since some of these words
(such as &amp;quot;Adam&amp;quot;) could refer to a different entity.
This information goes to a pre-trained maxi-
mum entropy model (see Mikheev (1998) for more
details on this aproach). This model takes into ac-
count contextual information for named entities,
such as their position in the sentence, whether
they exist in lowercase in general, whether they
were used in lowercase elsewhere in the same docu-
ment, etc. These features are passed to the model
as attributes of the partially matched words. If
the model provides a positive answer for a partial
match, the system makes a definite assignment.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.809479">
3.5 Step 3. Rule Relaxation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999958745762712">
Once this has been done, the system again applies
the grammar rules. But this time the rules have
much more relaxed contextual constraints and ex-
tensively use the information from already exist-
ing markup and from the lexicon compiled dur-
ing processing, e.g. containing partial orders of al-
ready identified named entities.
At this stage the system will mark word se-
quences which look like person names. For this
it uses a grammar of names: if the first capital-
ized word occurs in a list of first names and the
following word(s) are unknown capitalized words,
then this string can be tagged as a PERSON. Note
that it is only at this late stage that a list of names
is used. At this point we are no longer concerned
that a person name can refer to a company. If the
name grammar had applied earlier in the process,
it might erroneously have tagged &amp;quot;Adam Kluver&amp;quot;
as a PERSON instead of an ORGANIZATION. But at
this point in the chain of NE processing, that is not
a problem anymore: &amp;quot;Adam Kluver&amp;quot; will by now
already have been identified as an ORGANIZATION
by the sure-fire rules or during partial matching.
If it hasn&apos;t, then it is likely to be the name of a
person.
At this stage the system will also attempt to re-
solve conjunction problems in names of organisa-
tions. For example, in &amp;quot;China International Trust
and Investment Corp&amp;quot;, the system checks if pos-
sible parts of the conjunctions were used in the
text on their own and thus are names of different
organizations; if not, the system has no reason
to assume that more than one company is being
talked about.
In a similar vein, the system resolves the at-
tachment of sentence initial capitalized modifiers,
the problem alluded to above with the &amp;quot;Suspended
Ceiling Contractors Ltd&amp;quot; example: if the modifier
was seen with the organization name elsewhere in
the text, then the system has good evidence that
the modifier is part of the company name; if the
modifier does not occur anywhere else in the text
with the company name, it is assumed not to be
part of it.
This strategy is also used for expressions like
&amp;quot;Murdoch&apos;s News Corp&amp;quot;. The genitival &amp;quot;Mur-
doch&apos;s&amp;quot; could be part of the name of the organisa-
tion, or could be a possessive. Further inspection
of the text reveals that Rupert Murdoch is referred
to in contexts which support a person interpreta-
tion; and &amp;quot;News Corp&amp;quot; occurs on its own, without
the genitive. On the basis of evidence like this, the
system decides that the name of the organisation
is &amp;quot;News Corp&amp;quot;, and that &amp;quot;Murdoch&amp;quot; should be
tagged separately as a person.
At this stage known organizations and locations
from the lists available to the system are marked
in the text, again without checking the context in
which they occur.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.961766">
3.6 Step 4. Partial Match 2
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999974035714286">
At this point, the system has exhausted its re-
sources (rules about internal and external evi-
dence for named entities, as well as its gazetteers).
The system then performs another partial match
to annotate names like &amp;quot;White&amp;quot; when &amp;quot;James
White&amp;quot; had already been recognised as a person,
and to annotate company names like &amp;quot;Hughes&amp;quot;
when &amp;quot;Hughes Communications Ltd.&amp;quot; had al-
ready been identified as an organisation.
As in Partial Match 1, this process of par-
tial matching is again followed by a probabilis-
tic assignment supported by the maximum en-
tropy model. For example, conjunction resolution
makes use of the fact that in this type of text it is
more common to have conjunctions of like entities.
In &amp;quot;he works for X)cx and Yyy&amp;quot;, if there is evidence
that Xxx and Yyy are two entities rather than one,
then it is more likely that Xx.x and Yyy are two
entities of the same type, i.e. both organisations
or are both people, rather than a mix of the two.
This means that, even if only one of the entities in
the conjunction has been recognised as definitely
of a certain type, the conjunction rule will help
decide on the type of the other entity. One of
the texts in the competition contained the string
&amp;quot;U7ited States and Russia&amp;quot;. Because of the typo
in &amp;quot;U7ited States&amp;quot;, it wasn&apos;t found in a gazetteer.
But there was internal evidence that it could be

Because titles of news wires are in capital letters,
they provide little guidance for the recognition of
names. In the final stage of NE processing, enti-

In the muc competition, our system&apos;s combined
precision and recall score was 93.39%. This was
the highest score, better in a statistically signifi-
cant way than the score of the next best system.
Scores varied from 93.39% to 69.67%. Further de-
tails on this can be found in (Mikheev et al., 1998).
The table in Figure 3 shows the progress of the
performance of the system we fielded for the muc
competition through the five stages.
As one would expect, the sure-fire rules give
very high precision (around 96-98%), but very
low recallâ€”in other words, they don&apos;t find many
named entities, but the ones they find are correct.
Subsequent phases of processing add gradually
more and more named entities (recall increases
from around 40% to around 90%), but on occa-
sion introduce errors (resulting in a slight drop
in precision). Our final score for ORGANISATION,
PERSON and LOCATION is given in the bottom line
of Figure 3.

5 The role of gazetteers
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99993871875">
Our system fielded for the muc competition made
extensive use of gazetteers, containing around
4,900 names of countries and other place names,
some 30,000 names of companies and other organ-
isations, and around 10,000 first names of peo-
ple. As explained in the previous section, these
lists were used in a judicious way, taking into ac-
count other internal and external evidence before
making a decision about a named entity. Only
in step 3 is information from the gazetteers used
without context-checking.
It is not immediately obvious from Figure 3
what exactly the impact is of these gazetteers. To
try and answer this question, we ran our system
over 70 articles of the muc competition in differ-
ent modes; the remaining 30 articles were used
to compile a limited gazetteer as described below
and after that played no role in the experiments.
Full gazetteers. We first ran the system again
with the full gazetteers, i.e. the gazetteers used
in the official muc system. There are minor dif-
ferences in Recall and Precision compared to the
official muc results, due to the fact that we were
using a slightly different (smaller) corpus.
No gazetteers. We then ran the system with-
out any gazetteers. In this mode, the system can
still use internal evidence (e.g. indicators such
as &amp;quot;Mr&amp;quot; for people or &amp;quot;Ltd&amp;quot; for organisations) as
well as external evidence (contexts such as &amp;quot;XXX,
the chairman of YYY&amp;quot; as evidence that XXX is a
person and YYY an organisation).
The hypothesis was that names of organisations

and names of people should still be handled rel-
atively well by the system, since they have much
internal and external evidence, whereas names of
locations have fewer reliable contextual clues. For
example, expressions such as &amp;quot;XXX is based in
YYY&amp;quot; is not sure-fire evidence that YYY is a lo-
cation â€” it could also be an organisation. And
since many locations are so well-known, they re-
ceive very little extra context (&amp;quot;in China&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;in
Paris&amp;quot;, vs &amp;quot;in the small town of Ekeren&amp;quot;).
Some locations. We then ran the system with
some locational information: about 200 names
of countries and continents from www. yahoo. corn!
Regional/ and, because muc rules say explicitly
that names of planets should be marked up as
locations, the names of the 8 planets of our so-
lar system. The hypothesis was that even with
those reasonably common location names, Named
Entity recognition would already dramatically im-
prove. This hypothesis was confirmed, as can be
seen in Figure 4.
Inspection of the errors confirms that the sys-
tem makes most mistakes when there is no inter-
nal or external evidence to decide what sort of
Named Entity is involved. For example, in a ref-
erence to &amp;quot;a Hamburg hospital&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Hamburg&amp;quot; no
longer gets marked up as a location, because the
word occurs nowhere else in the text, and that
context is not sufficient to assume it indicates a lo-
cation (cf. a Community Hospital, a Catholic Hos-
pital, an NHS Hospital, a Trust-Controlled Hos-
pital, etc). Similarly, in a reference to &amp;quot;the Bonn
government&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Bonn&amp;quot; is no longer marked up as a
location, because of lack of supportive context (cf.
the Clinton government, the Labour government,
etc). And in financial newspaper articles NYSE
will be used without any indication that this is an
organisation (the New York Stock Exchange).
Limited gazetteers. The results so far sug-
gest that the most useful gazetteers are those that
contain very common names, names which the au-
thors can expect their audience already to know
about, rather than far-fetched examples of little
known places or organisations.
This suggests that it should be possible to tune
a system to the kinds of Named Entities that oc-
cur in its particular genre of text. To test this
hypothesis, we wanted to know how the system
would perform if it started with no gazetteers,
started processing texts, then built up gazetteers
as it goes along, and then uses these gazetteers on
a new set of texts in the same domain. We sim-
ulated these conditions by taking 30 of the 100
official MUG articles and extracting all the names
of people, organisations and locations and using
these as the only gazetteers, thereby ensuring that
we had extracted Named Entities from articles in
the same domain as the test domain.
Since we wanted to test how easy it was to build
gazetteers automatically, we wanted to minimise
the amount of processing done on Named Enti-
ties already found. We decided to only used first
names of people, and marked them all as &amp;quot;likely&amp;quot;
first names: the fact that &amp;quot;Bill&amp;quot; actually occurs as
a first name does not guarantee it will definitely be
a first name next time you see it. Company names
found in the 30 articles were put in the company
gazetteer, irrespective of whether they were full
company names (e.g. &amp;quot;MCI Communications Cor-
p&amp;quot; as well as &amp;quot;MCI&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;MCI Communication-
s&amp;quot;). Names of locations found in the 30 texts were
simply added to the list of 200 location names al-
ready used in the previous experiments.
The hope was that, despite the little effort in-
volved in building these limited gazetteers, there
would be an improved performance of the Named
Entity recognition system.
Figure 4 summarises the Precision and Recall
results for each of these modes and confirms the
hypotheses.

eighties. And simple techniques for extending the
gazetteers on the basis of a sample of just 30 arti-
cles already makes the system competitive again.
These experiments suggest that the collection
of gazetteers need not be a bottleneck: through a
judicious use of internal and external evidence rel-
atively small gazetteers are sufficient to give good
Precision and Recall. In addition, when collecting
these gazetteers one can concentrate on the obvi-
ous examples of locations and organisations, since
these are exactly the ones that will be introduced
in texts without much helpful context.
However, our experiments only show the useful-
ness of gazetteers on a particular type of text, viz.
journalistic English with mixed case. The rules as
well as the maximum entropy models make use of
internal and external evidence in that type of text
when trying to identify named entities, and it is
obvious that this system cannot be applied with-
out modification to a different type of text, e.g.
scientific articles. Without further formal eval-
uations with externally supplied evaluation cor-
pora it is difficult to judge how general this text
type is. It is encouraging to note that Krupka and
Hausman (1998) point out that the muc-7 articles
which we used in our experiments have less exter-
nal evidence than do Wall Street Journal articles,
which suggests that on Wall Street Journal arti-
cles our system might perform even better than
on muc-7 articles.

<abstract confidence="0.990687041666667">It is often claimed that Named Entity recognition systems need extensive gazetteersâ€”lists of names of people, organisations, locations, and other named entities. Indeed, the compilation of such gazetteers is sometimes mentioned as a bottleneck in the design of Named Entity recognition systems. We report on a Named Entity recognition system which combines rule-based grammars with statistical (maximum entropy) models. We report on the system&apos;s performance with gazetteers of different types and different sizes, using test material from the muc-7 competition. We show that, for the text type and task of this competition, it is sufficient to use relatively small gazetteers of well-known names, rather than large gazetteers of low-frequency names. We conclude with observations about the domain independence of the competition and of our experiments.</abstract>

For document retrieval purposes low recall is not necessarily a major problem since it is often sufficient to recognize just one occurrence of each distinctive entity per document, and many of the unassigned person and organization names were just repetitions of their full variants. But for many other applications, and for the muc competition, higher recall and precision are necessary. 3.2 Combining rules and statistics The system we fielded for muc-7 makes extensive use of what McDonald (1996) calls internal (phrasal) and external (contextual) evidence in named entity recognition.

For instance, if &amp;quot;Adam Kluver Ltd&amp;quot; had already been recognised as an organisation by the sure-fire rule, in this second step any occurrences of &amp;quot;Kluver Ltd&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Adam Ltd&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Adam Kluver&amp;quot; are also tagged as possible organizations. This assignment, however, is not definite since some of these words (such as &amp;quot;Adam&amp;quot;) could refer to a different entity. This information goes to a pre-trained maximum entropy model (see Mikheev (1998) for more details on this aproach). This model takes into account contextual information for named entities, such as their position in the sentence, whether they exist in lowercase in general, whether they were used in lowercase elsewhere in the same document, etc. These features are passed to the model as attributes of the partially matched words. If the model provides a positive answer for a partial match, the system makes a definite assignment. 3.5 Step 3. Rule Relaxation Once this has been done, the system again applies the grammar rules. But this time the rules have much more relaxed cont</context>

Such a system could be domain and language independent. It would need no grammars or even information about tokenization but simply mark up known strings in the text. Of course, the development and maintenance of the name lists would become more labour intensive. (Palmer and Day, 1997) evaluated the performance of such a minimal NE recognition system equipped with name lists derived from muc-6 training texts. The system was tested on newswire texts for six languages. It achieved a recall rate of about 70% for Chinese, Japanese and Portuguese and about 40% for English and French. The precision of the system was not calculated but can be assumed to be quite high because it would only be affected by cases where a capitalized word occurs in more than one list (e.g. &amp;quot;Columbia&amp;quot; could occur in the list of organisations as well as locations) or where a capitalised word occurs in a </context>
