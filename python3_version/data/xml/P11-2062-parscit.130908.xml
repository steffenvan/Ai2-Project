Arabic morphology is complex, partly because of its
richness, and partly because of its complex morpho-
syntactic agreement rules which depend on features
not necessarily expressed in word forms, such as
lexical rationality and functional gender and num-
ber. In this paper, we present an enriched ver-
sion of the Penn Arabic Treebank (PATB, part 3)
(Maamouri et al., 2004) that we manually anno-
tated for these features.1 We describe a process
for how to do the annotation efficiently; and fur-
thermore, present the first quantitative analysis of
morpho-syntactic phenomena in Arabic.
This resource is important for building computa-
tional models of Arabic morphology and syntax that
account for morpho-syntactic agreement patterns. It
has already been used to demonstrate added value
for Arabic dependency parsing (Marton et al., 2011).
This paper is structured as follows: Sec-
tions 2 and 3 present relevant linguistic facts and
related work, respectively. Section 4 describes our
annotation process and Section 5 presents an analy-
sis of the annotated corpus.

Arabic has a rich and complex morphology. In addi-
tion to being both templatic (root/pattern) and con-
catenative (stems/affixes/clitics), Arabic’s optional
diacritics add to the degree of word ambiguity
(Habash, 2010). This paper focuses on two specific
issues of Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) nominal
morphology involving the features of gender and
number only: the discrepancy between morpholog-
ical form and function and the complex system of
morpho-syntactic agreement.

Arabic nominals (i.e. nouns, proper nouns and
adjectives) and verbs inflect for gender: mascu-
line (M) and feminine (F), and for number: sin-
gular (5), dual (D) and plural (P). These fea-
tures are typically realized using a small set of
suffixes that uniquely convey gender and num-
ber combinations: +0 (M5), S+ +h2 (F5),
à@+ +An (MD), �àA�K+ +tAn (FD), àð+ +wn (MP),
and :)@+ +At (FP).3 For example, the adjective
QëAÓ mAhr ‘clever’ has the following forms among
others: QëAÓ mAhr (M5), SQëAÓ mAhrh (F5), vðQëAÓ
mAhrwn (MP), and u@QëAÓ mAhrAt (FP). For a
sizable minority of words, these features are ex-
pressed templatically, i.e., through pattern change,
coupled with some singular suffix. A typical ex-
ample of this phenomenon is the class of broken

2.2 Morpho-syntactic Agreement
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999209730769231">
Arabic gender and number features participate in
morpho-syntactic agreement within specific con-
structions such as nouns and their adjectives and
verbs and their subjects. Arabic agreement rules are
more complex than the simple matching rules found
in languages such as French or Spanish (Holes,
2004; Habash, 2010).
First, Arabic adjectives agree with the nouns
they modify in gender and number except for plu-
ral irrational (non-human) nouns, which always
take feminine singular adjectives. For example,
the two plural words DAJ.ËA£ TAlbAt ( F P
F P R)5 ‘stu-
dents’ and uAJ.&lt;Ó mktbAt ‘libraries’ ( FP
FPI) take
the adjective ‘new’ as �H@YK�Yg. jdydAt ( FP
FPN )
and SYK
Yg. jdydh ( F S
F SN ), respectively. Ra-
tionality is a morpho-lexical feature. There are
nouns that are semantically rational/human but not
morpho-syntactically, e.g., H. ñªƒ: šSwb ( MS MPI ) ‘na-
tions/peoples’ takes a feminine singular adjective.6
Second, verbs and their nominal subjects have the
same rules as nouns and their adjectives, except that,

</figure>
<figureCaption confidence="0.758144142857143">
5We specify rationality as part of the functional features of
the word. The values of this feature are: rational (R), irra-
tional (I), and not-applicable (N). N is assigned to verbs, ad-
jectives, numbers and quantifiers.
6Rationality (‘humanness’ ‘ÉiA« Q&amp;��«/ÉiA«’) is narrower
than animacy. English expresses it mainly in pronouns (he/she
vs. it) and relativizers (men who... vs. cars/cows which...).
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.99943175">
additionally, verbs in verb-subject (VSO) order only
agree in gender and default to singular number. For
example, the sentence ‘the men traveled’ can appear
as @ðQ-¯Aƒ ÈAg. QË@ AlrjAl ( MS

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.972212615384615">
Third, number quantification has unique rules
(Dada, 2007), e.g., numbers over 10 always take a
singular noun, while numbers 3 to 10 take a plu-
ral noun and inversely agree with the noun’s func-
tional gender.7 Compare, for instance, `)AJ.ËA£ •Ô g�
xms ( MS MSN ) TAlbAt ( F P
F ) ‘five [female] students’
PR
with H. C£ �é‚Ôg� xmsh ( FS FSN ) TlAb ( MS
MPR) ‘five
[male] students’ and aJ.ËA£ uñ‚Ô g� xmswn ( MP
BP N )
TAlbh ( F S
F SR) ‘lit. fifty [female] student[s]’. Fig-
ure 1 presents one example that combines the three
phenomena mentioned above. The example is in a
dependency representation based on the Columbia
Arabic Treebank (CATIB) (Habash and Roth, 2009).
Finally, although the rules described above are
generally followed, there are numerous exceptions
that can typically be explained as some form of fig-
ure of speech involving elision or overridden ratio-
nality/irrationality. For example, the word Lpk. jyš
( MS
MSI ) ‘army’ can take the rational MP agreement
in an elided reference to its members.

function discrepancy, although it is typically not discussed as
such in Arabic grammar.

4.4 Inter-Annotator Agreement
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999988555555556">
We computed inter-annotator agreement (IAA) over
a random set of 397 lemma clusters with 509 word
types corresponding to 4,781 tokens. The type-
based IAA scores for words with known lemmas are
93.7%, 99.0% and 89.6% for gender, number and
rationality respectively. The corresponding token-
based IAA scores are 94.5%, 99.7% and 95.1%. The
respective Kappa values (Cohen, 1960) for types are
0.87, 0.97, 0.82 and for tokens 0.89, 0.99, 0.92.
Based on these scores, the number features is the
easiest to annotate, followed by gender and ratio-
nality. This is explainable by the fact that num-
ber in Arabic is always expressed morphologically
through affix or stem change, while gender is more
lexical, and rationality is completely lexical. The
corresponding IAA scores for all words (including
words with unknown lemmas) drop to 86.8%, 94.9%
and 82.9% (for types) and 93.5%, 99.2% and 94.0%
(for tokens). The respective Kappa values for types
are 0.74, 0.85, 0.73 and for tokens 0.87, 0.97, 0.90
The difference caused by missing lemmas highlights
the need and value for complete annotations in the
PATB. The overall high scores for IAA suggest that
the task is not particularly hard for humans to per-
form, and that disambiguating information is cru-
cial. Points of disagreement will be addressed in
future extensions of the guidelines.

Table 1 summarizes the different combinations of

der, the M value seems to be twice as common as
F both in form and function. In 91.4% of all nomi-

most agreement (98.8%) followed by nouns (92.5%)
and then proper nouns (74.6%). As for number, 5
is the dominant value in form (91.8%) and func-
tion (83.1%). Broken plurals (p) are almost 55%
of all plurals. 99.5% of proper nouns are singular,
which means that rationality is effectively irrelevant
for proper nouns as a feature, since it is only rel-
evant morpho-syntactically with plurals. Although
the great majority of nouns are irrational, proper
nouns tend to be almost equally split between ra-
tional and irrational. In terms of gender and number
(jointly), 85% of all nominals have matching form
and function values, with adjective having the high-
est ratio, followed by nouns and then proper nouns.

We focus on three agreement classes: Noun-

and Number-Noun (multiple configurations). We
only consider structural bigrams in the CATIB
(Habash and Roth, 2009) dependency version of the
training portion of the PATB (part 3) used by Mar-
ton et al. (2011). See Figure 1 for an example. The
total number of relevant bigrams is 39,561 or almost
11.6% of all bigrams. Over two-thirds are Noun-
Adj, and around a quarter are Verb-Subject. For
each agreement class, we compare using a simple
agreement rule (parent and child values match) with
using an implementation of the complex agreement
rules summarized in Section 2. We also compare
using form-based features or functional features.10

We presented a large resource enriched with latent
features necessary for modeling morpho-syntactic
agreement in Arabic. In future work, we plan to use
both corpus annotations and agreement rules to auto-

plan to extend agreement rules to include complex

The issue figures-of-speech is highlighted as a challenge and annotators are asked to think of different contexts for the word in question. 4.4 Inter-Annotator Agreement We computed inter-annotator agreement (IAA) over a random set of 397 lemma clusters with 509 word types corresponding to 4,781 tokens. The typebased IAA scores for words with known lemmas are 93.7%, 99.0% and 89.6% for gender, number and rationality respectively. The corresponding tokenbased IAA scores are 94.5%, 99.7% and 95.1%. The respective Kappa values (Cohen, 1960) for types are 0.87, 0.97, 0.82 and for tokens 0.89, 0.99, 0.92. Based on these scores, the number features is the easiest to annotate, followed by gender and rationality. This is explainable by the fact that number in Arabic is always expressed morphologically through affix or stem change, while gender is more lexical, and rationality is completely lexical. The corresponding IAA scores for all words (including words with unknown lemmas) drop to 86.8%, 94.9% and 82.9% (for types) and 93.5%, 99.2% and 94.0% (for tokens).

N is assigned to verbs, adjectives, numbers and quantifiers. 6Rationality (‘humanness’ ‘ÉiA« Q&amp;��«/ÉiA«’) is narrower than animacy. English expresses it mainly in pronouns (he/she vs. it) and relativizers (men who... vs. cars/cows which...). additionally, verbs in verb-subject (VSO) order only agree in gender and default to singular number. For example, the sentence ‘the men traveled’ can appear as @ðQ-¯Aƒ ÈAg. QË@ AlrjAl ( MS MPR) sAfrwA ( MP MPN ) or as ÈAg. QË@ Q�¯AƒsAfr ( MS MSN) AlrjAl ( MS MPR). Third, number quantification has unique rules (Dada, 2007), e.g., numbers over 10 always take a singular noun, while numbers 3 to 10 take a plural noun and inversely agree with the noun’s functional gender.7 Compare, for instance, `)AJ.ËA£ •Ô g� xms ( MS MSN ) TAlbAt ( F P F ) ‘five [female] students’ PR with H.

Finally, although the rules described above are generally followed, there are numerous exceptions that can typically be explained as some form of figure of speech involving elision or overridden rationality/irrationality. For example, the word Lpk. jyš ( MS MSI ) ‘army’ can take the rational MP agreement in an elided reference to its members. 7Reverse gender agreement can be modeled as a formfunction discrepancy, although it is typically not discussed as such in Arabic grammar. 358 3 Related Work tokens are already diacritized and lemma/part-ofMuch work has been done on Arabic computa- speec</context>

Although the great majority of nouns are irrational, proper nouns tend to be almost equally split between rational and irrational. In terms of gender and number (jointly), 85% of all nominals have matching form and function values, with adjective having the highest ratio, followed by nouns and then proper nouns. 5.2 Morpho-syntactic Agreement Patterns We focus on three agreement classes: NounAdj(ective), Verb-Subject (VSO and SVO orders) and Number-Noun (multiple configurations). We only consider structural bigrams in the CATIB (Habash and Roth, 2009) dependency version of the training portion of the PATB (part 3) used by Marton et al. (2011). See Figure 1 for an example. The total number of relevant bigrams is 39,561 or almost 11.6% of all bigrams. Over two-thirds are NounAdj, and around a quarter are Verb-Subject. For each agreement class, we compare using a simple agreement rule (parent and child values match) with using an implementation of the complex agreement rules summarized in Section 2. We also compare using form-based features or functional features.10 Table 2 presents the percentage of bigrams we determine to agree (i.e. be gra</context>

In addition to being both templatic (root/pattern) and concatenative (stems/affixes/clitics), Arabic’s optional diacritics add to the degree of word ambiguity (Habash, 2010). This paper focuses on two specific issues of Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) nominal morphology involving the features of gender and number only: the discrepancy between morphological form and function and the complex system of morpho-syntactic agreement. 2.1 Form and Function Arabic nominals (i.e. nouns, proper nouns and adjectives) and verbs inflect for gender: masculine (M) and feminine (F), and for number: singular (5), dual (D) and plural (P). These features are typically realized using a small set of suffixes that uniquely convey gender and number combinations: +0 (M5), S+ +h2 (F5), à@+ +</context>

We describe our process for efficient annotation, and present the first quantitative analysis of Arabic morphosyntactic phenomena. 1 Introduction Arabic morphology is complex, partly because of its richness, and partly because of its complex morphosyntactic agreement rules which depend on features not necessarily expressed in word forms, such as lexical rationality and functional gender and number. In this paper, we present an enriched version of the Penn Arabic Treebank (PATB, part 3) (Maamouri et al., 2004) that we manually annotated for these features.1 We describe a process for how to do the annotation efficiently; and furthermore, present the first quantitative analysis of morpho-syntactic phenomena in Arabic.

We only consider structural bigrams in the CATIB (Habash and Roth, 2009) dependency version of the training portion of the PATB (part 3) used by Marton et al. (2011). See Figure 1 for an example. The total number of relevant bigrams is 39,561 or almost 11.6% of all bigrams. Over two-thirds are NounAdj, and around a quarter are Verb-Subject. For each agreement class, we compare using a simple agreement rule (parent and child values match) with using an implementation of the complex agreement rules summarized in Section 2. We also compare using form-based features or functional features.10 Table 2 presents the percentage of bigrams we determine to agree (i.e. be grammatical) under different features and rules.
