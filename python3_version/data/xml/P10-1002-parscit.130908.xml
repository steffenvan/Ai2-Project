In this paper we describe an intuitionistic
method for dependency parsing, where a
classifier is used to determine whether a
pair of words forms a dependency edge.
And we also propose an effective strategy
for dependency projection, where the de-
pendency relationships of the word pairs
in the source language are projected to the
word pairs of the target language, leading
to a set of classification instances rather
than a complete tree. Experiments show
that, the classifier trained on the projected
classification instances significantly out-
performs previous projected dependency
parsers. More importantly, when this clas-
sifier is integrated into a maximum span-
ning tree (MST) dependency parser, ob-
vious improvement is obtained over the
MST baseline.

<bodyText confidence="0.999897583333334">
Supervised dependency parsing achieves the state-
of-the-art in recent years (McDonald et al., 2005a;
McDonald and Pereira, 2006; Nivre et al., 2006).
Since it is costly and difficult to build human-
annotated treebanks, a lot of works have also been
devoted to the utilization of unannotated text. For
example, the unsupervised dependency parsing
(Klein and Manning, 2004) which is totally based
on unannotated data, and the semisupervised de-
pendency parsing (Koo et al., 2008) which is
based on both annotated and unannotated data.
Considering the higher complexity and lower per-
formance in unsupervised parsing, and the need of
reliable priori knowledge in semisupervised pars-
ing, it is a promising strategy to project the de-
pendency structures from a resource-rich language
to a resource-scarce one across a bilingual corpus
(Hwa et al., 2002; Hwa et al., 2005; Ganchev et al.,
2009; Smith and Eisner, 2009; Jiang et al., 2009).
For dependency projection, the relationship be-
tween words in the parsed sentences can be sim-
ply projected across the word alignment to words
in the unparsed sentences, according to the DCA
assumption (Hwa et al., 2005). Such a projec-
tion procedure suffers much from the word align-
ment errors and syntactic isomerism between lan-
guages, which usually lead to relationship projec-
tion conflict and incomplete projected dependency
structures. To tackle this problem, Hwa et al.
(2005) use some filtering rules to reduce noise,
and some hand-designed rules to handle language
heterogeneity. Smith and Eisner (2009) perform
dependency projection and annotation adaptation
with quasi-synchronous grammar features. Jiang
and Liu (2009) resort to a dynamic programming
procedure to search for a completed projected tree.
However, these strategies are all confined to the
same category that dependency projection must
produce completed projected trees. Because of the
free translation, the syntactic isomerism between
languages and word alignment errors, it would
be strained to completely project the dependency
structure from one language to another.
We propose an effective method for depen-
dency projection, which does not have to pro-
duce complete projected trees. Given a word-
aligned bilingual corpus with source language sen-
tences parsed, the dependency relationships of the
word pairs in the source language are projected to
the word pairs of the target language. A depen-
dency relationship is a boolean value that repre-
sents whether this word pair forms a dependency
edge. Thus a set of classification instances are ob-
tained. Meanwhile, we propose an intuitionistic
model for dependency parsing, which uses a clas-
sifier to determine whether a pair of words form
a dependency edge. The classifier can then be
trained on the projected classification instance set,
so as to build a projected dependency parser with-
out the need of complete projected trees.

Experimental results show that, the classifier
trained on the projected classification instances
significantly outperforms the projected depen-
dency parsers in previous works. The classifier
trained on the Chinese projected classification in-
stances achieves a precision of 58.59% on the CTB
standard test set. More importantly, when this
classifier is integrated into a 2nd-ordered max-
imum spanning tree (MST) dependency parser
(McDonald and Pereira, 2006) in a weighted aver-
age manner, significant improvement is obtained
over the MST baselines. For the 2nd-order MST
parser trained on Penn Chinese Treebank (CTB)
5.0, the classifier give an precision increment of
0.5 points. Especially for the parser trained on the
smaller CTB 1.0, more than 1 points precision in-
crement is obtained.
In the rest of this paper, we first describe
the word-pair classification model for dependency
parsing (section 2) and the generation method
of projected classification instances (section 3).
Then we describe an application of the projected
parser: boosting a state-of-the-art 2nd-ordered
MST parser (section 4). After the comparisons
with previous works on dependency parsing and
projection, we finally five the experimental results.

Following (McDonald et al., 2005a), x is used to
denote the sentence to be parsed, and xi to denote
the i-th word in the sentence. y denotes the de-
pendency tree for sentence x, and (i, j) E y rep-
resents a dependency edge from word xi to word
xj, where xi is the parent of xj.
The task of the word-pair classification model
is to determine whether any candidate word pair,
xi and xj s.t. 1 G i, j G JxJ and i =� j, forms a
dependency edge. The classification result C(i, j)
can be a boolean value:

<bodyText confidence="0.994220517241379">
as produced by a support vector machine (SVM)
classifier (Vapnik, 1998). p = 1 indicates that the
classifier supports the candidate edge (i, j), and
p = 0 the contrary. C(i, j) can also be a real-
valued probability:
C(i,j)=p 0 G p G 1 (2)
as produced by an maximum entropy (ME) classi-
fier (Berger et al., 1996). p is a probability which
indicates the degree the classifier support the can-
didate edge (i, j). Ideally, given the classifica-
tion results for all candidate word pairs, the depen-
dency parse tree can be composed of the candidate
edges with higher score (1 for the boolean-valued
classifier, and large p for the real-valued classi-
fier). However, more robust strategies should be
investigated since the ambiguity of the language
syntax and the classification errors usually lead to
illegal or incomplete parsing result, as shown in
Figure 1.
Follow the edge based factorization method
(Eisner, 1996), we factorize the score of a de-
pendency tree s(x, y) into its dependency edges,
and design a dynamic programming algorithm
to search for the candidate parse with maximum
score. This strategy alleviate the classification er-
rors to some degree and ensure a valid, complete
dependency parsing tree. If a boolean-valued clas-
sifier is used, the search algorithm can be formal-

After the introduction of the word-pair classifica-

jected dependency instances. In order to allevi-
ate the effect of word alignment errors, we base
the projection on the alignment matrix, a compact
representation of multiple GIZA++ (Och and Ney,
2000) results, rather than a single word alignment
in previous dependency projection works. Figure
2 shows an example.
Suppose a bilingual sentence pair, composed of
a source sentence e and its target translation f. ye
is the parse tree of the source sentence. A is the
alignment matrix between them, and each element
Ai,j denotes the degree of the alignment between
word ei and word fj. We define a boolean-valued

other hand, there are as many as 2|f|(|f|−1) candi-
date projected dependency instances for the target

b for Cp(i, j) to filter out the ambiguous instances:
the instances with Cp(i, j) &gt; b are selected as the
positive, and the instances with Cp(i, j) &lt; 1 − b

Here, s]B and sr denote the evaluation functions
of the baseline model and the projected classi-
fier, respectively. The parameter A is the relative
weight of the projected classifier against the base-
line model.
There are several strategies to integrate the two
evaluation functions. For example, they can be in-
tegrated deeply at each decoding step (Carreras et
al., 2008; Zhang and Clark, 2008; Huang, 2008),
or can be integrated shallowly in a reranking man-
ner (Collins, 2000; Charniak and Johnson, 2005).
As described previously, the score of a depen-
dency tree given by a word-pair classifier can be
factored into each candidate dependency edge in
this tree. Therefore, the projected classifier can
be integrated with a baseline model deeply at each
dependency edge, if the evaluation score given by
the baseline model can also be factored into de-
pendency edges.
We choose the 2nd-ordered MST model (Mc-
Donald and Pereira, 2006) as the baseline. Es-
pecially, the effect of the Collins distance in the
baseline model is also investigated. The relative
weight A is adjusted to maximize the performance
on the development set, using an algorithm similar
to minimum error-rate training (Och, 2003).

Both the graph-based (McDonald et al., 2005a;
McDonald and Pereira, 2006; Carreras et al.,
2006) and the transition-based (Yamada and Mat-
sumoto, 2003; Nivre et al., 2006) parsing algo-
rithms are related to our word-pair classification
model.
Similar to the graph-based method, our model
is factored on dependency edges, and its decod-
ing procedure also aims to find a maximum span-
ning tree in a fully connected directed graph. From
this point, our model can be classified into the
graph-based category. On the training method,
however, our model obviously differs from other
graph-based models, that we only need a set of
word-pair dependency instances rather than a reg-
ular dependency treebank. Therefore, our model is
more suitable for the partially bracketed or noisy
training corpus.
The most apparent similarity between our
model and the transition-based category is that
they all need a classifier to perform classification
conditioned on a certain configuration. However,
they differ from each other in the classification re-
sults. The classifier in our model predicates a de-
pendency probability for each pair of words, while
the classifier in a transition-based model gives a
possible next transition operation such as shift or
reduce. Another difference lies in the factoriza-
tion strategy. For our method, the evaluation score
of a candidate parse is factorized into each depen-
dency edge, while for the transition-based models,
the score is factorized into each transition opera-
tion.
Thanks to the reminding of the third reviewer
of our paper, we find that the pairwise classifica-
tion schema has also been used in Japanese de-
pendency parsing (Uchimoto et al., 1999; Kudo
and Matsumoto, 2000). However, our work shows
more advantage in feature engineering, model
training and decoding algorithm.

the dependency tree completely to the target lan-

projection strategy prefer to extract a set of depen-

of this strategy is that, we can select an appropriate

Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the Penn English
Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993), and the Penn Chi-
nese Treebank (CTB) 5.0 (Xue et al., 2005). The

For English, we use the automatically-assigned
POS tags produced by an implementation of the
POS tagger of Collins (2002). While for Chinese,
we just use the gold-standard POS tags following
the tradition. Each treebank is splitted into three
partitions, for training, development and testing,
respectively, as shown in Table 2.
For a dependency tree with n words, only n −

They account for only a small proportion of all the

to balance the proportions of the positive and the

We define a new parameter r to denote the ratio of

the current state-of-the-art models.
For example, r = 2 means we reserve negative
instances two times as many as the positive ones.
The MaxEnt toolkit by Zhang 2 is adopted to
train the ME classifier on extracted instances. We
set the gaussian prior as 1.0 and the iteration limit
as 100, leaving other parameters as default values.
We first investigate the impact of the ratio r on
the performance of the classifier. Curves in Fig-
ure 3 show the performance of the English and
Chinese parsers, each of which is trained on an in-
stance set corresponding to a certain r. We find
that for both English and Chinese, maximum per-
formance is achieved at about r = 2.5. 3 The
English and Chinese classifiers trained on the in-
stance sets with r = 2.5 are used in the final eval-
uation phase. Table 3 shows the performances on
the test sets of WSJ and CTB 5.0.
We also compare them with previous works on
the same test sets. On both English and Chinese,
the word-pair classification model falls behind of
the state-of-the-art. We think that it is probably

the alteration of r.

due to the local optimization of the training pro-
cedure. Given complete trees as training data, it
is easy for previous models to utilize structural,
global and linguistical information in order to ob-
tain more powerful parameters. The main advan-
tage of our model is that it doesn’t need complete
trees to tune its parameters. Therefore, if trained
on instances extracted from human-annotated tree-
banks, the word-pair classification model would
not demonstrate its advantage over existed state-
of-the-art dependency parsing methods.

6.2 Dependency Projection
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999177">
In this work we focus on the dependency projec-
tion from English to Chinese. We use the FBIS
Chinese-English bitext as the bilingual corpus for
dependency projection. It contains 239K sen-
tence pairs with about 6.9M/8.9M words in Chi-
nese/English. Both English and Chinese sentences
are tagged by the implementations of the POS tag-
ger of Collins (2002), which trained on WSJ and
CTB 5.0 respectively. The English sentences are
then parsed by an implementation of 2nd-ordered
MST model of McDonald and Pereira (2006),
which is trained on dependency trees extracted
from WSJ. The alignment matrixes for sentence
pairs are generated according to (Liu et al., 2009).
Similar to the ratio r, the threshold b need also
be assigned an appropriate value to achieve a bet-
ter performance. Larger thresholds result in better
but less classification instances, the lower cover-
age of the instances would hurt the performance of
the classifier. On the other hand, smaller thresh-
olds lead to worse but more instances, and too
much noisy instances will bring down the classi-
fier’s discriminating power.

set we train a classifier and test it on the develop-
ment set of CTB 5.0. Figure 4 presents the ex-
perimental results. The curve shows that the max-
imum performance is achieved at the threshold of
about 0.85. The classifier corresponding to this
threshold is evaluated on the test set of CTB 5.0,
and the test set of CTB 2.0 determined by Hwa et
al. (2005). Table 4 shows the performance of the
projected classifier, as well as the performance of
previous works on the corresponding test sets. The
projected classifier significantly outperforms pre-
vious works on both test sets, which demonstrates
that the word-pair classification model, although
falling behind of the state-of-the-art on human-
annotated treebanks, performs well in projected
dependency parsing. We give the credit to its good
collaboration with the word-pair classification in-
stance extraction for dependency projection.

<bodyText confidence="0.999851153846154">
We integrate the word-pair classification model
into the state-of-the-art 2nd-ordered MST model.
First, we implement a chart-based dynamic pro-
gramming parser for the 2nd-ordered MST model,
and develop a training procedure based on the
perceptron algorithm with averaged parameters
(Collins, 2002). On the WSJ corpus, this parser
achieves the same performance as that of McDon-
ald and Pereira (2006). Then, at each derivation
step of this 2nd-ordered MST parser, we weight-
edly add the evaluation score given by the pro-
jected classifier to the original MST evaluation
score. Such a weighted summation of two eval-

uation scores provides better evaluation for can-
didate parses. The weight parameter A is tuned
by a minimum error-rate training algorithm (Och,
2003).
Given a 2nd-ordered MST parser trained on
CTB 5.0 as the baseline, the projected classi-
fier brings an accuracy improvement of about 0.5
points. For the baseline trained on the smaller
CTB 1.0, whose training set is chapters 1-270 of
CTB 5.0, the accuracy improvement is much sig-
nificant, about 1.5 points over the baseline. It
indicates that, the smaller the human-annotated
treebank we have, the more significant improve-
ment we can achieve by integrating the project-
ing classifier. This provides a promising strategy
for boosting the parsing performance of resource-
scarce languages. Table 5 summarizes the experi-
mental results.

7 Conclusion and Future Works
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999986272727273">
In this paper, we first describe an intuitionis-
tic method for dependency parsing, which re-
sorts to a classifier to determine whether a word
pair forms a dependency edge, and then propose
an effective strategy for dependency projection,
which produces a set of projected classification in-
stances rather than complete projected trees. Al-
though this parsing method falls behind of pre-
vious models, it can collaborate well with the
word-pair classification instance extraction strat-
egy for dependency projection, and achieves the
state-of-the-art in projected dependency parsing.
In addition, when integrated into a 2nd-ordered
MST parser, the projected parser brings signifi-
cant improvement to the baseline, especially for
the baseline trained on smaller treebanks. This
provides a new strategy for resource-scarce lan-
guages to train high-precision dependency parsers.
However, considering its lower performance on
human-annotated treebanks, the dependency pars-
ing method itself still need a lot of investigations,
especially on the training method of the classifier.

And we also propose an effective strategy for dependency projection, where the dependency relationships of the word pairs in the source language are projected to the word pairs of the target language, leading to a set of classification instances rather than a complete tree. Experiments show that, the classifier trained on the projected classification instances significantly outperforms previous projected dependency parsers. More importantly, when this classifier is integrated into a maximum spanning tree (MST) dependency parser, obvious improvement is obtained over the MST baseline.</abstract>

The classification result C(i, j) can be a boolean value: C(i, j) = p p E t0, 11 (1) as produced by a support vector machine (SVM) classifier (Vapnik, 1998). p = 1 indicates that the classifier supports the candidate edge (i, j), and p = 0 the contrary.

Ideally, given the classification results for all candidate word pairs, the dependency parse tree can be composed of the candidate edges with higher score (1 for the boolean-valued classifier, and large p for the real-valued classifier).

The constituent trees in the two treebanks are transformed to dependency trees according to the headfinding rules of Yamada and Matsumoto (2003). For English, we use the automatically-assigned POS tags produced by an implementation of the POS tagger of Collins (2002). While for Chinese, we just use the gold-standard POS tags following the tradition. Each treebank is splitted into three partitions, for training, development and testing, respectively, as shown in Table 2. For a dependency tree with n words, only n − 1 positive dependency instances can be extracted. They account for only a small proportion of all the dependency instances. As we know, it is important to balance the proportions of the positive and the negative instances for a batched-trained classifier.

Therefore, if trained on instances extracted from human-annotated treebanks, the word-pair classification model would not demonstrate its advantage over existed stateof-the-art dependency parsing methods. 6.2 Dependency Projection In this work we focus on the dependency projection from English to Chinese. We use the FBIS Chinese-English bitext as the bilingual corpus for dependency projection. It contains 239K sentence pairs with about 6.9M/8.9M words in Chinese/English. Both English and Chinese sentences are tagged by the implementations of the POS tagger of Collins (2002), which trained on WSJ and CTB 5.0 respectively. The English sentences are then parsed by an implementation of 2nd-ordered MST model of McDonald and Pereira (2006), which is trained on dependency trees extracted from WSJ. The alignment matrixes for sentence pairs are generated according to (Liu et al., 2009). Similar to the ratio r, the threshold b need also be assigned an appropriate value to achieve a better performance. Larger thresholds result in better but less classification instances, the lower coverage of the instances would hurt the performance of the classifier. On the other hand, sm</context>

We give the credit to its good collaboration with the word-pair classification instance extraction for dependency projection. 6.3 Integrated Dependency Parser We integrate the word-pair classification model into the state-of-the-art 2nd-ordered MST model. First, we implement a chart-based dynamic programming parser for the 2nd-ordered MST model, and develop a training procedure based on the perceptron algorithm with averaged parameters (Collins, 2002). On the WSJ corpus, this parser achieves the same performance as that of McDonald and Pereira (2006). Then, at each derivation step of this 2nd-ordered MST parser, we weightedly add the evaluation score given by the projected classifier to the original MST evaluation score. Such a weighted summation of two eval18 uation scores provides better evaluation for candidate parses. The weight parameter A is tuned by a minimum error-rate training algorithm (Och, 2003). Given a 2nd-ordered MST parser trained on CTB 5.0 as the baseline, the projected classifier brings an accuracy improvement of about 0</context>

Ideally, given the classification results for all candidate word pairs, the dependency parse tree can be composed of the candidate edges with higher score (1 for the boolean-valued classifier, and large p for the real-valued classifier). However, more robust strategies should be investigated since the ambiguity of the language syntax and the classification errors usually lead to illegal or incomplete parsing result, as shown in Figure 1. Follow the edge based factorization method (Eisner, 1996), we factorize the score of a dependency tree s(x, y) into its dependency edges, and design a dynamic programming algorithm to search for the candidate parse with maximum score. This strategy alleviate the classification errors to some degree and ensure a valid, complete dependency parsing tree. If a boolean-valued classifier is used, the search algorithm can be formalized as: y� = argmax s(x, y) Y = argmax � C(i,j) (3) Y (i,j)∈Y And if a probability-valued classifier is used instead, we replace the accumulation with cumula13 Type Features Unigram wordi ◦ posi wordi posi wordj ◦ posj wordj pos</context>

In order to alleviate the effect of word alignment errors, we base the projection on the alignment matrix, a compact representation of multiple GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2000) results, rather than a single word alignment in previous dependency projection works.

The parameter A is the relative weight of the projected classifier against the baseline model. There are several strategies to integrate the two evaluation functions. For example, they can be integrated deeply at each decoding step (Carreras et al., 2008; Zhang and Clark, 2008; Huang, 2008), or can be integrated shallowly in a reranking manner (Collins, 2000; Charniak and Johnson, 2005). As described previously, the score of a dependency tree given by a word-pair classifier can be factored into each candidate dependency edge in this tree. Therefore, the projected classifier can be integrated with a baseline model deeply at each dependency edge, if the evaluation score given by the baseline model can also be factored into dependency edges.

Considering the higher complexity and lower performance in unsupervised parsing, and the need of reliable priori knowledge in semisupervised parsing, it is a promising strategy to project the dependency structures from a resource-rich language to a resource-scarce one across a bilingual corpus (Hwa et al., 2002; Hwa et al., 2005; Ganchev et al., 2009; Smith and Eisner, 2009; Jiang et al., 2009).

Another difference lies in the factorization strategy. For our method, the evaluation score of a candidate parse is factorized into each dependency edge, while for the transition-based models, the score is factorized into each transition operation. Thanks to the reminding of the third reviewer of our paper, we find that the pairwise classification schema has also been used in Japanese dependency parsing (Uchimoto et al., 1999; Kudo and Matsumoto, 2000). However, our work shows more advantage in feature engineering, model training and decoding algorithm. 5.2 Dependency Projection Many works try to learn parsing knowledge from bilingual corpora. L¨u et al. (2002) aims to obtain Chinese bracketing knowledge via ITG (Wu, 1997) alignment. Hwa et al. (2005) and Ganchev et al.

First, we implement a chart-based dynamic programming parser for the 2nd-ordered MST model, and develop a training procedure based on the perceptron algorithm with averaged parameters (Collins, 2002). On the WSJ corpus, this parser achieves the same performance as that of McDonald and Pereira (2006). Then, at each derivation step of this 2nd-ordered MST parser, we weightedly add the evaluation score given by the projected classifier to the original MST evaluation score. Such a weighted summation of two eval18 uation scores provides better evaluation for candidate parses. The weight parameter A is tuned by a minimum error-rate training algorithm (Och, 2003).

The task of the word-pair classification model is to determine whether any candidate word pair, xi and xj s.t. 1 G i, j G JxJ and i =� j, forms a dependency edge. The classification result C(i, j) can be a boolean value: C(i, j) = p p E t0, 11 (1) as produced by a support vector machine (SVM) classifier (Vapnik, 1998). p = 1 indicates that the classifier</context>

A feature fk(i, j, r) E f(i, j, r) equals 1 if it is activated by the assumption and equals 0 otherwise.

The relative weight A is adjusted to maximize the performance on the development set, using an algorithm similar to minimum error-rate training (Och, 2003). 5 Related Works 5.1 Dependency Parsing Both the graph-based (McDonald et al., 2005a; McDonald and Pereira, 2006; Carreras et al., 2006) and the transition-based (Yamada and Matsumoto, 2003; Nivre et al., 2006) parsing algorithms are related to our word-pair classification model. Similar to the graph-based method, our model is factored on dependency edges, and its decoding procedure also aims to find a maximum spanning tree in a fully connected directed graph. From this point, our model can be classified into the graph-based category. On the training method, however, our model obviously diffe</context>

On the WSJ corpus, this parser achieves the same performance as that of McDonald and Pereira (2006). Then, at each derivation step of this 2nd-ordered MST parser, we weightedly add the evaluation score given by the projected classifier to the original MST evaluation score. Such a weighted summation of two eval18 uation scores provides better evaluation for candidate parses. The weight parameter A is tuned by a minimum error-rate training algorithm (Och, 2003). Given a 2nd-ordered MST parser trained on CTB 5.0 as the baseline, the projected classifier brings an accuracy improvement of about 0.5 points. For the baseline trained on the smaller CTB 1.0, whose training set is chapters 1-270 of CTB 5.0, the accuracy improvement is much significant, about 1.5 points over the baseline. It indicates that, the smaller the human-annotated treebank we have, the more significant improvement we can achieve by integrating the projecting classifier. This provides a promising strategy for boosting the parsing performance of resourcescarce languages. Table 5 summar</context>

For example, the unsupervised dependency parsing (Klein and Manning, 2004) which is totally based on unannotated data, and the semisupervised dependency parsing (Koo et al., 2008) which is based on both annotated and unannotated data. Considering the higher complexity and lower performance in unsupervised parsing, and the need of reliable priori knowledge in semisupervised parsing, it is a promising strategy to project the dependency structures from a resource-rich language to a resource-scarce one across a bilingual corpus (Hwa et al., 2002; Hwa et al., 2005; Ganchev et al., 2009; Smith and Eisner, 2009; Jiang et al., 2009). For dependency projection, the relationship between words in the parsed sentences can be simply projected across the word alignment to words in the unparsed sentences, according to the DCA assumption (Hwa et al., 2005). Such a projection procedure suffers much from the word alignment errors and syntactic isomerism between languages, which usually lead to relationship projection conflict and incomplete projected dependency structures. To tackle this problem, Hwa et al. (2005) use some filtering rules to reduce noise, and some hand-designed rules to handle language heterog</context>

Another difference lies in the factorization strategy. For our method, the evaluation score of a candidate parse is factorized into each dependency edge, while for the transition-based models, the score is factorized into each transition operation. Thanks to the reminding of the third reviewer of our paper, we find that the pairwise classification schema has also been used in Japanese dependency parsing (Uchimoto et al., 1999; Kudo and Matsumoto, 2000).

The task of the word-pair classification model is to determine whether any candidate word pair, xi and xj s.t. 1 G i, j G JxJ and i =� j, forms a dependency edge. The classification result C(i, j) can be a boolean value: C(i, j) = p p E t0, 11 (1) as produced by a support vector machine (SVM) classifier (Vapnik, 1998). p = 1 indicates that the classifier supports the candidate edge (i, j), and p = 0 the contrary. C(i, j) can also be a realvalued probability: C(i,j)=p 0 G p G 1 (2) as produced by an maximum entropy (ME) classifier (Berger et al., 1996). p is a probability which indicates the degree the classifier support the candidate edge (i, j). Ideally, given the classification results for all candidate word pairs, the dependency parse tree can be composed of the candidate edges with higher score (1 for the boolean-valued classifier, and large p for the real-valued classifier).
