Most of this book (the first 148 pages) is an English
version of an introduction to mathematical linguistics
originally published in Russian in 1969. This material
has been expanded into a more standard-sized book for
the English-speaking market by tacking on three articles
on special topics in mathematical linguistics published
elsewhere by one or both co-authors; but each of these
articles is already available in English translation, and the
book stands or falls by the usefulness of its first part.
When Gladkij and Mel&apos;euk wrote their book in the
late 1960s, mathematical linguistics was little known,
even in the USA where most of it had been created not
long before. I guess that it was a fairly remarkable
achievement on their part to discover and master this
exotic discipline (and, in Gladkij&apos;s case, to make a
number of original contributions to it), and then to make
it known to their fellow-countrymen.
However, whether it makes good sense to bring out an
English version of the book in the 1980s is a different
matter. I must say that I feel the answer is no, for many
reasons.
In the first place, mathematical linguistics has moved
on since the 1960s. Gladkij and Mel&apos;euk&apos;s book deals
almost exclusively with the hierarchy of types of
language, defined in terms of types of grammar (unre-
stricted rewrite systems, context-sensitive grammars,
context-free grammars, one-sided linear grammars), with
a small amount on the relationship with types of automa-
ta, on decidability theorems, and a few other matters.
The topic of parsing — and mathematical formalisms with
special relevance for automatic language processing, such
as the ATN — are not mentioned. In 1969, one would not
have expected them to be; in the 1980s, these are surely
indispensable components even in an introduction to
&amp;quot;mathematical&amp;quot; (as opposed to &amp;quot;computational&amp;quot;) linguis-
tics. Gladkij and Mel&apos;euk are quite explicit about the fact
that they have made no attempt to bring the book up to
date: &amp;quot;The manuscript of the Russian version of this
book was completed in 1967 and we are not in a position
to revise it now. . . . Even a mere list of references
would be out of the question.&amp;quot;
Secondly, the book relies heavily on Russian-language
examples which are lost on an English reader. Thus,
early chapters largely revolve round a largish formal
grammar produced by the authors in order to generate
the complex range of Russian participles. It must have
been a significant virtue of the original book that it
demonstrated how the concepts of mathematical linguis-
tics could be made to achieve a novel task relating specif-
ically to the readers&apos; own language, but for a British or
American student the result is that ideas many people
find difficult at the best of times are rendered wholly
opaque.
And, finally, Gladkij and Mereuk just are not very
good at writing for an unknowledgeable audience. They
make their formal rules notationally much more complex
and exotic-looking than they need be — to a fellow math-
ematician, a trivial matter, but for an unconfident student
very unfortunate. On page 25 they use the term monoid
without, I think, ever explaining what it means (there is
no index, so it is hard to check); on page 81 they use a
technical term of their own which is first defined on page
122.
The fact is that there are now enough English-lan-
guage books that do the same job as this book and do it
much better.

it is not an expression in an interlingua or knowledge
representation that is independent of the source
language.
Van Bakel takes view of both language and linguistics
counter to those currently prevailing in North America (I
don&apos;t know about Europe or elsewhere). First, he rejects
any connection between theoretical linguistics and
computational linguistics, seeing the former as no longer
having anything to say to the latter, which may now
proceed solely as an application-oriented enterprise.
Second, in contrast to the situation semantics view a la
Barwise and Perry (1983), van Bakel sees reality as
being structure or constrained by language rather than
the other way round. &amp;quot;The reality which is related to [a
