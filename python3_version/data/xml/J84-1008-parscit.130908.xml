The FINITE STRING Newsletter Meeting Minutes
Minutes of the 1983
European Chapter General Meeting
</note>
<bodyText confidence="0.995849892307693">
Following are the minutes of the first ACL European
Chapter General Meeting, held 1 September 1983 in
Pisa, Italy. In the absence of Eva Haji6ova, the Chair-
person of the Chapter, Harry Somers, the Chapter
Secretary, presided.
On the programme and local arrangements for this
inaugural chapter meeting, Giacomo Ferrari reported
that 64 papers had been submitted, each of which had
been sent to three referees. The 32 papers in the final
programme had then been selected by the programme
committee consisting of Ferrari (in the chair), Joost
Breuker, Gerald Gazdar, Margaret King, Winfred
Lenders, Petr Sgall, and Antonio Zampolli, who had
met in two groups in Prague and in Geneva. The
number of participants was given as just over 100,
which was very encouraging given the relatively short
time span since the announcement of the meeting.
In his Secretary&apos;s report, Harry Somers pointed out
that the Chapter was now just one year old, and in
this time membership had increased by 162 (not in-
cluding new members at the Meeting), compared with
25 new European members in the previous year, an
increase of 648 percent. Of these new members, 45
were East Europeans taking advantage of the Interna-
tional Fund, who were welcomed most cordially.
Overall, European membership had increased by an
impressive 83 percent.
Mike Rosner presented his Treasurer&apos;s report, in
which he drew attention to the fact that members were
only now being asked to pay their 1983 dues because
of the delays in production of the Journal. He re-
minded members that payment by cheque in any West-
ern currency was acceptable.
On behalf of the Nominations Committee, Ferrari
announced that Benny Brodda had been named to
replace Yorick Wilks on the Advisory Committee, as
Yorick would be spending the next year on leave in
Australia and Costa Rica. Ferrari expressed the
Chapter&apos;s gratitude for Yorick&apos;s contribution to ACL
activities in Europe, especially his invaluable help in
setting up the Chapter over the last two years. All the
other offices were recommended for reelection. With
this announcement, the election procedure was insti-
gated as described in the Chapter&apos;s constitution.
Don Walker reported on activities in the Central
Administration. He stated that the possibility of form-
ing an East Asian Chapter for members in the Far
East and Australasia was being considered. He then
reminded members of the existence of the Internation-
al Fund, the main purpose of which was to provide
funds for memberships, purchase of proceedings, and,
if resources permitted, grants for attendance at meet-
ings for speakers, for whom currency restrictions made
such payments difficult. In answer to a question from
the floor concerning the possibility of using the Fund
to help such members buy relevant books for their
libraries, Walker pointed out that the priority use of
the Fund was to provide as many people as possible
access to the AJCL via membership in the Association.
With regard to the Journal, Walker stated that the
first issue of Volume 8 (1983) was currently in prepa-
ration and due for mailing at the end of September.
From 1984 onwards the Journal would be titled simply
Computational Linguistics, reflecting the more inter-
national nature of the Association. Walker reminded
members that the Association was publishing, in con-
nection with the Cambridge University Press, a series
of books entitled &amp;quot;Studies in Natural Language Proc-
essing.&amp;quot; Three titles in the series were currently under
contract: a collection of papers on Natural Language
Processing–Psychological, Computational, and Theoreti-
cal Perspectives, edited by David Dowty, Lauri Karttu-
nen, and Arnold Zwicky; Generating Natural Language
by Kathleen McKeown; and Planning Natural Lan-
guage Utterances by Douglas Appelt.
The Proceedings of the Pisa Conference would also
be published by the Association during the coming
months. A copy of the Proceedings was included in
the Conference fees, and all those in attendance would
receive one in due course.
On the subject of Future Meetings of the Chapter,
Somers reported on a proposal of Gerald Gazdar to
simplify and standardise the organisation of refereeing
and selection of papers. This would be considered at
the appropriate time. It was agreed that future Chap-
ter meetings were desirable and there was some dis-
cussion of possible locations and dates. It was agreed
that conflict with other relevant conferences — espe-
cially COLING — should be avoided, and the meeting
eventually settled on a principle of convening every
other Spring starting in 1985. Possible locations for
the next meeting include Manchester, Geneva, Paris,
and Copenhagen; they will be investigated by the Ad-
visory Committee. Walker reminded members that
ACL was jointly sponsoring the forthcoming COLING
meeting at Stanford University, Stanford, California,
in July of 1984, and that the deadline for submission
of extended abstracts was January.
The question of Associate Membership in the ACL
for members of sister organisations was introduced by
Hubert Lehmann, with particular reference to the Ger-
man organisation LDV. It was agreed that the two
organisations did not wish to appear to be in competi-
tion with each other, and that the members of both
would benefit from general cooperation. This might
take the form of an exchange of information, with the
possibility of a joint conference some time in the fu-
ture. It was felt that the question of joint membership
as such was, for financial reasons, probably not desira-
ble.

The FINITE STRING Newsletter Meeting Minutes
Under other business, Stephen Cushing presented a
motion that the Chapter should take a stand against
the involvement of the U.S. Government in El Salva-
dor. Walker pointed out that constitutionally the
meeting could not take a binding vote on such an is-
sue. He questioned whether the ACL should take a
position on this kind of issue, and recommended that
members should do so as individuals if they wished.
Other members felt that this particular issue was not
relevant to computational linguistics as such. It was
also felt by some that it was undesirable for the ACL
to be seen to be overtly political, especially as this
might make it even more difficult for members from
certain countries to participate in its activities. The
motion was ruled out of order, and it was agreed that
those interested would met to discuss the matter as
individuals, but that the Association would take no
official stand.

ACL INTERNATIONAL FUND
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999766">
At its Executive Committee meeting in Toronto on 19
June 1982, the ACL established the &amp;quot;ACL Internation-
al Fund.&amp;quot; Its primary purpose is to make ACL mem-
berships and publications available to colleagues who
have difficulties in using their national currencies for
international transactions. During 1982 and 1983, the
Fund received $2533.25 in contributions; expenses
amounted to approximately $2000. Since we are in
the process of expanding the number of members in
this category, we are very much in need of additional
contributions. The list that follows identifies people
who contributed during 1982 and 1983. It is present-
ed here both to express our appreciation and to en-
courage members to continue to support the fund. If
you have contributed during this period and your name
is not listed, please contact the Secretary-Treasurer
and accept his apologies for the omission. While we
would welcome larger contributions, small ones can
accumulate very rapidly. We anticipate serving about
100 International Fund members by the end of the
year. If we provide memberships to all and proceed-
ings to at least the major institutions and laboratories,
the cost will be approximately $2000. Contributions
of $4 each from 500 of our members would provide
that amount. Please contribute what you can. The
dues statement provides a place for doing that, but
you can send a check to the Secretary-Treasurer made
out to the ACL International Fund at any time. His
address is located on the back cover.
