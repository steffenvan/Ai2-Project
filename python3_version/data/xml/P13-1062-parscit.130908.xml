This paper studies the problem of mining
named entity translations from compara-
ble corpora with some “asymmetry”. Un-
like the previous approaches relying on the
“symmetry” found in parallel corpora, the
proposed method is tolerant to asymme-
try often found in comparable corpora, by
distinguishing different semantics of rela-
tions of entity pairs to selectively prop-
agate seed entity translations on weakly
comparable corpora. Our experimental
results on English-Chinese corpora show
that our selective propagation approach
outperforms the previous approaches in
named entity translation in terms of the
mean reciprocal rank by up to 0.16 for or-
ganization names, and 0.14 in a low com-
parability case.

<bodyText confidence="0.996785631578947">
Identifying and understanding entities is a cru-
cial step in understanding text. This task is
more challenging in the presence of multilingual
text, because translating named entities (NEs),
such as persons, locations, or organizations, is
a non-trivial task. Early research on NE trans-
lation used phonetic similarities, for example,
to mine the translation ‘Mandelson’-+‘曼 德
森’[ManDeErSen] with similar sounds. However,
not all NE translations are based on translitera-
tions, as shown in Table 1—Some translations,
especially the names of most organizations, are
based on semantic equivalences. Furthermore,
names can be abbreviated in one or both lan-
guages, e.g., the ‘World Trade Organization’ (世
界贸易组织) can be called the ‘WTO’ (世贸组
织). Another challenging example is that, a trans-
lation can be arbitrary, e.g., ‘Jackie Chan’ -+ ‘成
龙’ [ChengLong]. There are many approaches

that deal with some of these challenges (Lam et
al., 2007; Yang et al., 2009), e.g., by combin-
ing phonetic similarity and a dictionary. How-
ever, arbitrary translations still cannot be handled
by examining the NE pair itself. Corpus-based ap-
proaches (Kupiec, 1993; Feng, 2004), by mining
external signals from a large corpus, such as par-
enthetical translation “成龙 (Jackie Chan)”, com-
plement the problem of transliteration-based ap-
proaches, but the coverage of this approach is lim-
ited to popular entities with such evidence.
The most effective known approach to NE
translation has been a holistic framework (You et
al., 2010; Kim et al., 2011; You et al., 2012) com-
bining transliteration- and corpus-based methods.
In these approaches, both 1) arbitrary translations
and 2) lesser-known entities can be handled, by
propagating the translation scores of known enti-
ties to lesser-known entities if they co-occur fre-
quently in both corpora. For example, a lesser-
known entity Tom Watson can be translated if
Mandelson and Tom Watson co-occur frequently
in an English corpus, and their Chinese transla-
tions also co-occur frequently in a Chinese corpus,
i.e., if the co-occurrences in the two corpora are
“symmetric”.
A research question we ask in this paper is:
What if comparable corpora are not comparable
enough to support this symmetry assumption? We
found that this is indeed the case. For exam-
ple, even English and Chinese news from the
same publisher may have different focus– the Chi-
nese version focuses more on Chinese Olympic

teams and Chinese local news. In the presence of
such asymmetry, all previous approaches, building
upon symmetry, quickly deteriorate by propagat-
ing false positives. For example, co-occurrence of
Mandelson and Tom Watson may not appear in a
Chinese corpus, which may lead to the translation
of Tom Watson into another Chinese entity Gor-
don Brown which happens to co-occur with the
Chinese translation of Mandelson.
Our key contribution is to avoid such false
propagation, by discerning the semantics of rela-
tions. For example, relations between Mandelson
and Tom Watson, should be semantically differ-
ent from Chinese relations between ‘�R·-*M’
(Gordon Brown) and ‘#- . ,*,’ (Mandelson). A
naive approach would be finding documents with
a similar topic such as politics, and scientific dis-
covery, and allowing propagation only when the
topic agrees. However, we found that a topic is a
unit that is too coarse for this task because most
articles on Mandelson will invariably fall into the
same topic&apos;. In clear contrast, we selectively prop-
agate seed translations, only when the relations in
the two corpora share the same semantics.
This selective propagation can be especially ef-
fective for translating challenging types of enti-
ties such as organizations including the WTO used
with and without abbreviation in both languages.
Applying a holistic approach (You et al., 2012)
on organizations leads to poor results, 0.06 in
terms of the F1-score. A naive approach to in-
crease the precision would be to consider multi-
type co-occurrences, hoping that highly precise
translations of some type, e.g., persons with an
F1-score of 0.69 (You et al., 2012), can be prop-
agated to boost the precision on organizations.
In our experiments, this naive multi-type prop-
agation still leads to an unsatisfactory F1-score
of 0.12. Such a low score can be explained by
the following example. When translating ‘WTO’
using the co-occurrence with ‘Mandelson’, other
co-occurrences such as (London, Mandelson) and
(EU, Mandelson) produce a lot of noise because
the right translation of WTO does not share much
phonetic/semantic similarity. Our understanding
of relation semantics, can distinguish “Mandelson
was born in London” from “Mandelson visited the
WTO”, to stop false propagations, which gener-
ates an F1-score 0.25 higher than the existing ap-

proaches.
More formally, we enable selective propagation
of seed translations on weakly comparable cor-
pora, by 1) clarifying the detailed meaning of rela-
tional information of co-occurring entities, and 2)
identifying the contexts of the relational informa-
tion using statement-level context comparison. In
other words, we propagate the translation score of
a known translation pair to a neighbor pair if the
semantics of their relations in English and Chinese
corpora are equivalent to accurately propagate the
scores. For example, if we know ‘Russia’-+‘ItY
W(1) and join-+*A(2), then from a pair of state-
ments “Russia(1) joins(2) the WTO(3)” and “ItY*(1)
jN/�_(2) -9JW911#&apos;(3)”, we can propagate the trans-
lation score of (Russia, ItY*)(1) to (WTO, -9
JW911#&apos;)(3). However, we do not exploit a pair of
statements “Russia joined the WTO” and “ItY*
�3(2’) #4*” because i!*(2’) does not mean
join(2). Furthermore, we mine a similar English-
Chinese document pair that can be found by com-
paring the entity relationships, such as “Mandel-
son visited Moscow” and “Mandelson met Alexei
Kudrin”, within the English document and the
Chinese document to leverage similar contexts to
assure that we use symmetric parts.
For this goal, we first extract relations among
entities in documents, such as visit and join, and
mine semantically equivalent relations across the
languages, e.g., English and Chinese, such as
join-+*A. Once these relation translations are
mined, similar document pairs can be identified
by comparing each constituent relationship among
entities using their relations. Knowing document
similarity improves NE translation, and improved
NE translation can boost the accuracy of document
and relationship similarity. This iterative process
can continue until convergence.
To the best of our knowledge, our approach is
the first to translate a broad range of multilin-
gual relations and exploit them to enhance NE
translation. In particular, our approach leverages
semantically similar document pairs to exclude
incomparable parts that appear in one language
only. Our method outperforms the previous ap-
proaches in translating NE up to 0.16 in terms of
the mean reciprocal rank (MRR) for organization
names. Moreover, our method shows robustness,
with 0.14 higher MRR than seed translations, on
less comparable corpora.

Existing approaches on NE translation can be cat-
egorized into 1) transliteration-based, 2) corpus-
based, and 3) hybrid approaches.
Transliteration-based approaches (Wan and Ver-
spoor, 1998; Knight and Graehl, 1998) are the
foundations of many decent methods, but they
alone suffer from ambiguity (e.g., 史 蒂 夫 and
始第夫 have the same sounds) and cannot han-
dle non-transliterated cases such as ‘Jackie Chan
(成龙[ChengLong])’. Some methods (Lam et al.,
2007; Yang et al., 2009) rely on meanings of con-
stituent letters or words to handle organization
name translation such as ‘Bank of China (中国
银行)’, whose translation is derived from ‘China
(中
国)’, and ‘a bank (银 行)’. However, many
names often originate from abbreviation (such as
‘WTO’); hence we cannot always leverage mean-
ings.
Corpus-based approaches (Kupiec, 1993; Lin et
al., 2008; Jiang et al., 2009) exploit high-quality
bilingual evidence such as parenthetical transla-
tion, e.g., “成龙 (Jackie Chan)”, (Lin et al., 2008),
semi-structural patterns (Jiang et al., 2009), and
parallel corpus (Kupiec, 1993). However, the cov-
erage of the corpus-based approaches is limited to
popular entities with such bilingual evidences. On
the other hand, our method can cover entities with
monolingual occurrences in corpora, which signif-
icantly improves the coverage.
The most effective known approach is a holis-
tic framework that combines those two ap-
proaches (You et al., 2012; You et al., 2010; Kim
et al., 2011). You et al. (2010; 2012) leverage two
graphs of entities in each language, that are gen-
erated from a pair of corpora, with edge weights
quantified as the strength of the relatedness of en-
tities. Then, two graphs are iteratively aligned us-
ing the common neighbors of two entities. Kim et
al. (2011) build such graphs using the context sim-
ilarity, measured with a bag of words approach, of
entities in news corpora to translate NEs. How-
ever, these approaches assume the symmetry of the
two graphs. This assumption holds if two corpora
are parallel, but such resources are scarce. But our
approach exploits comparable parts from corpora.

<bodyText confidence="0.990242810810811">
Other interesting approaches such as (Klemen-
tiev and Roth, 2006; Kim et al., 2012) rely on tem-
poral distributions of entities. That is, two entities
are considered to be similar if the two entities in
different languages have similar occurrence distri-
butions over time. However, the effectiveness of
this feature also depends on the comparability of
entity occurrences in time-stamped corpora, which
may not hold as shown in Figure 1. In clear con-
trast, our method can find and compare articles,
on different dates, describing the same NE. More-
over, our method does not require time stamps.
Semantically similar relation mining
Recently, similar relation mining in one language
has been studied actively as a key part of automatic
knowledge base construction. In automatically
constructed knowledge bases, finding semanti-
cally similar relations can improve understanding
of the Web describing content with many different
expressions. As such an effort, PATTY (Nakas-
hole et al., 2012) finds similar relations with al-
most the same support sets–the sets of NE pairs
that co-occur with the relations. However, because
of the regional locality of information, bilingual
corpora contain many NE pairs that appear in only
one of the support sets of the semantically identi-
cal relations. NELL (Mohamed et al., 2011) finds
related relations using seed pairs of one given re-
lation; then, using K-means clustering, it finds re-
lations that are semantically similar to the given
relation. Unfortunately, this method requires that
we set K manually, and extract relations for each
given relation. Therefore, this is unsuitable to sup-
port general relations.
There are only few works on translating rela-
tions or obtaining multi-lingual similar relations.

In this section, we provide an overview of our
framework for translating NEs, using news cor-
pora in English and Chinese as a running example.
Because such corpora contain asymmetric parts,
the goal of our framework is to overcome asym-
metry by distinguishing the semantics of relations,
and leveraging document context defined by the
relations of entities.
For this purpose, we build a mutual bootstrap-
ping framework (Figure 2), between entity trans-
lation and relation translation using extracted re-
lationships of entities (Figure 2 (a), Section 4.1).
More formally, we use the following process:

In this section, we describe our method in de-

which are units of relational information, from
documents in Section 4.1, and how we obtain seed
name translations in Section 4.2. Next, we present
our method for discovering relation translations
across languages in Section 4.3. In Section 4.4, we
use the name translations and the relation trans-
lations to compare document contexts which can
boost the precision of NE translation. In Sec-

(x, r, y), representing a relationship between two
names, x and y. For example, from “Mandel-
son recently visited Moscow,” we obtain this state-
ment: (Mandelson, visit, Moscow). We follow a
standard procedure to extract statements, as sim-

4.3 Relation Translation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999464043478261">
We need to identify relations that have the equiv-
alent semantics across languages, (e.g., visit→访
fol), to enable selective propagation of translation
scores. Formally, our goal is to measure a pair-
wise relation translation score TR(rE, rC) for an
English relation rE ∈ RE and a Chinese relation
rC ∈ RC where RE is a set of all English relations
and RC is a set of all Chinese relations.
We first explain a basic feature to measure the
similarity of two relations, its limitations, and how
we address the problems. A basic clue is that re-
lations of the same meaning are likely to be men-
tioned with the same entity pairs. For example,
if we have (Mandelson, visit, Moscow) as well as
(Mandelson, head to, Moscow) in the corpus, this
is a positive signal that the two relations may share
the same meaning. Such NE pairs are called sup-
port pairs of the two relations.
We formally define this clue for relations in the
same language, and then describe that in the bilin-
gual setting. A support intersection Hm(ri, rj), a
set of support pairs, for monolingual relations ri
and rj is defined as
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.985404">
Hm(ri, rj) = H(ri) ∩ H(rj) (1)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.915756263157895">
where H(r) is the support set of a relation r de-
fined as H(r) = {(x, y)|(x, r, y) ∈ S}, and S is
either SE, a set of all English statements, or SC, a
set of all Chinese statements that we extracted in
Section 4.1.
Likewise, we can define a support intersection
for relations in the different languages using the
translation score TN(eE, eC). For an English rela-
tion rE and a Chinese relation rC,
Hb(rE, rC) ={(xE, xC, yE, yC)|
TN(xE, xC) ≥ 0
and TN(yE, yC) ≥ 0
for (xE, rE, yE) ∈ SE
and (xC, rC, yC) ∈ SC}
where 0 = 0.6 is a harsh threshold to exclude most
of the false translations by TN.
Finally, we define a support intersection, a set
of support pairs between two relations ri and rj of
any languages,

<bodyText confidence="0.985799888888889">
Intuitively, |H(ri,rj) |indicates the strength of
the semantic similarity of two relations ri and
rj of any languages. However, as shown in Ta-
ble 2, we cannot use this value directly to mea-
sure the similarity because the support intersection
of semantically similar bilingual relations (e.g.,
|H(head to, 访问) |= 2) is generally very low,
and normalization cannot remedy this problem
as we can see from |H(visit, 访问) |= 27 and

connected. To exploit this feature, we use a ran-
dom walk-based graph clustering method.
Formally, we use Markov clustering (Van Don-
gen, 2000) on a graph G = (V, E) of relations,
where V = RE U RC is a set of all English and
Chinese relations. An edge (ri, rj) indicates that
two relations in any languages are similar, and its
weight is quantified by a sigmoid function on a
linear transformation of |H(ri, rj) |that was em-
pirically found to produce good results.
Each resultant cluster forms a set of bilingual
similar relations, c = {rc1, ..., rcm }, such as visit-
cluster, which consists of visit, head to, and 访问
in Figure 4. However, this cluster may not contain
all similar relations. A relation may have multi-
ple meanings (e.g., call on) so it can be clustered
to another cluster, or a relation might not be clus-
tered when its support set is too small (e.g., fly
to). For such relations, rather than assigning zero
similarity to visit-relations, we compute a cluster
membership function based on support pairs of the
cluster members and the target relation, and then
formulate a pairwise relation translation score.
Formally, we learn the membership function
of a relation r to a cluster c using support vec-
tor regression (Joachims, 1999) with the follow-
ing features based on the support set of cluster c,
H(c) = UrEc H(r), and the support intersection
of r and c, H(r, c) = Ur.Ec H(r, r*).

use of Hwithin and Hshared is based on the obser-

Based on this membership function S(r, c), we
compute pairwise relation similarity. We consider
that two relations are similar if they have at least
one cluster that the both relations belong to, which
can be measured with S(r, c). More formally,
pairwise similarity of relations ri and rj is defined

A brute-force statement matching approach often
fails due to ambiguity created by ignoring con-
text, and missing information in TN or TR. There-
fore, we detect similar document pairs to boost
the statement matching process. Unlike the pre-
vious approaches (e.g., bag-of-words), we focus
on the relationships of entities within documents
using the extracted statements.
Formally, we compute the similarity of two
statements sE = (xE, rE, yE) and sC =
(xC, rC, yC) in different languages as follows:
TS(sE, sC) = TN(xE, xC)TR(rE, rC)TN(yE, yC)

With this definition, we can find similar statements
described with different vocabularies in different
languages.

5.1 Data and Evaluation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999973708333333">
We processed news articles for an entire year in
2008 by Xinhua news who publishes news in
both English and Chinese, which were also used
by Kim et al. (2011) and Shao and Ng (2004). The
English corpus consists of 100,746 news articles,
and the Chinese corpus consists of 88,031 news
articles. The news corpora are not parallel but
comparable corpora, with asymmetry of entities
and relationship as the asymmetry in the number
of documents also suggest. Examples of such lo-
cality in Xinhua news include the more extensive
coverage of Chinese teams in the Olympics and
domestic sports in the Chinese news. Our frame-
work finds and leverages comparable parts from
the corpora without document-content-external in-
formation such as time stamps. We also show that,
under the decreasing comparability, our method
retains higher MRR than the baselines.
We follow the evaluation procedures used
by You et al. (2012) and Kim et al. (2011) to
fairly and precisely compare the effectiveness of
our methods with baselines. To measure perfor-
mance, we use mean reciprocal rank (MRR) to
evaluate a translation function T:
</bodyText>

MRR(T) = |Q |rankT(u, v) (9)

where Q is the set of gold English-Chinese trans-
lation pairs (u, v) and rankT(u, v) is the rank of
T (u, v) in {T (u, w)|w is a Chinese entity}. In ad-
dition, we use precision, recall, and F1-score.
As gold translation pairs, we use the evaluation
data used by You et al. (2012) with additional la-
bels, especially for organizations. The labeling
task is done by randomly selecting English enti-
ties and finding their Chinese translation from the
Chinese corpus. We only use entities with trans-
lations that appear in the Chinese corpus. We
present the evaluation results for persons and or-
ganizations to show the robustness of the meth-
ods. In total, we identified 490 English entities in
the English news with Chinese translations in the
Chinese news. Among the 490 entities, 221 NEs
are persons and 52 NEs are organizations.

We compare our methods with the following base-
lines.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.992042333333333">
• TPSH+P (You et al., 2012) is a holistic method
that uses a transliteration method as base
translations, and then reinforces them to
achieve higher quality. This method uses
only a single type of entities to propagate the
translation scores.
• TPMH+P is the holistic method revised to use
naive multi-type propagation that uses multi-
ple types of entities to reinforce the transla-
tion scores.
• THB is a linear combination of transliteration
and semantic translation methods (Lam et al.,
2007) tuned to achieve the highest MRR.
• TDict is a dictionary-only method. This dic-
tionary is used by both THB and TN.

Only the translation pairs of scores above 0.35

measure precision, recall and F1-score. For our
method T(t)
N , we use the result with (t) = 1,
the seed translations, and (t) = 2, which means
that only one pass of the whole framework is per-
formed to improve the seed translation function.
In addition, we use translation pairs with scores
above 0.05 to measure precision, recall, and F1-
score. Note that these thresholds do not affect
MRRs.

of precision, recall, F1-score and MRR. With only
one iteration of selective propagation, the seed
translation is improved to achieve the 0.09 higher
MRR.
The baselines show lower, but comparable
MRRs and F1-scores for persons that mostly con-
sist of transliterated cases. However, not all trans-
lations have phonetic similarity, especially orga-
nization names, as the low F1-score of TPSH+P,
0.06, for organizations suggests. The naive multi-
type propagation TPMH+P shows decreased MRR
for both persons and organizations compared to
the single-type propagation TPSH+P, which shows
a negative influence of diverse relation semantics
of entities of different types. THB achieves a bet-
ter MRR than TPH+P due to the semantic transla-
tion of organization names. However, despite the
increased recall of THB over that of TDict, the pre-
cision of THB is unsatisfactory because THB maps
abbreviated names such as ‘WTO’ with other NEs.
On the other hand, our method achieves the high-
est MRR and precision in both the person and or-
ganization categories.
As shown in Table 4, THB translates ‘WTO’ in-
accurately, linking it to an incorrect organization
‘巴解组织’ (Palestine Liberation Organization).

dicated by the arrows. We stress this is an extreme
case for illustration, where the two sentences are
almost an exact translation, except for a minor
asymmetry involving the date (Thursday in En-
glish, and 14th in Chinese). In most similar doc-
uments, the asymmetry is more significant. The
seed translation score T1�(WTO, 世贸组织) is not
enough to match the entities. However, the context
similarity, due to other similar statements such as
(1), allows us to match (2). This match helps trans-
lation of ‘WTO’ by inspecting the organization
that Russia considers to join in both documents.

Unlike the previous approaches relying on the “symmetry” found in parallel corpora, the proposed method is tolerant to asymmetry often found in comparable corpora, by distinguishing different semantics of relations of entity pairs to selectively propagate seed entity translations on weakly comparable corpora. Our experimental results on English-Chinese corpora show that our selective propagation approach outperforms the previous approaches in named entity translation in terms of the mean reciprocal rank by up to 0.16 for organization names, and 0.14 in a low comparability case.</abstract>

Furthermore, names can be abbreviated in one or both languages, e.g., the ‘World Trade Organization’ (世 界贸易组织) can be called the ‘WTO’ (世贸组 织). Another challenging example is that, a translation can be arbitrary, e.g., ‘Jackie Chan’ -+ ‘成 龙’ [ChengLong]. There are many approaches Table 1: Examples of non-phonetic translations. that deal with some of these challenges (Lam et al., 2007; Yang et al., 2009), e.g., by combining phonetic similarity and a dictionary. However, arbitrary translations still cannot be handled by examining the NE pair itself. Corpus-based approaches (Kupiec, 1993; Feng, 2004), by mining external signals from a large corpus, such as parenthetical translation “成龙 (Jackie Chan)”, complement the problem of transliteration-based approaches, but the coverage of this approach is limited to popular entities with such evidence. The most effective known approach to NE translation has been a holistic framework (You et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2011; You et al., 2012) combining transliteration- and corpus-based methods.

A relation may have multiple meanings (e.g., call on) so it can be clustered to another cluster, or a relation might not be clustered when its support set is too small (e.g., fly to). For such relations, rather than assigning zero similarity to visit-relations, we compute a cluster membership function based on support pairs of the cluster members and the target relation, and then formulate a pairwise relation translation score. Formally, we learn the membership function of a relation r to a cluster c using support vector regression (Joachims, 1999) with the following features based on the support set of cluster c, H(c) = UrEc H(r), and the support intersection of r and c, H(r, c) = Ur.Ec H(r, r*). • f1(r, c) = |H(r, c)|/|H(r)|: This quantifies the degree of inclusion, H(c) E H(r). • f2(r, c) = |H(r, c)|/|H(c)|: This quantifies the degree of inclusion, H(r) E H(c). • f3(r,c) = |Hwithin(r,c)|/|Hwithin(c)|: This is a variation of f2 that considers only noun phrase pairs shared at least once by relations in c. • f4(r, c) = |Hwithin(r, c)|/|Hshared(c)|: This is a variation of f2 that considers only noun phrase pairs shared at least once by a</context>

However, arbitrary translations still cannot be handled by examining the NE pair itself. Corpus-based approaches (Kupiec, 1993; Feng, 2004), by mining external signals from a large corpus, such as parenthetical translation “成龙 (Jackie Chan)”, complement the problem of transliteration-based approaches, but the coverage of this approach is limited to popular entities with such evidence. The most effective known approach to NE translation has been a holistic framework (You et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2011; You et al., 2012) combining transliteration- and corpus-based methods. In these approaches, both 1) arbitrary translations and 2) lesser-known entities can be handled, by propagating the translation scores of known entities to lesser-known entities if they co-occur frequently in both corpora. For example, a lesserknown entity Tom Watson can be translated if Mandelson and Tom Watson co-occur frequently in an English corpus, and their Chinese translations also co-occur frequently in a Chinese corpus, i.e., if the co-occurrences in the two corpora are “symmetric”.

We use an English-Chinese general word dictionary containing approximately 80,000 English-Chinese translation word pairs that was also used by Kim et al.

Formally, our goal is to measure a pairwise relation translation score TR(rE, rC) for an English relation rE ∈ RE and a Chinese relation rC ∈ RC where RE is a set of all English relations and RC is a set of all Chinese relations.

We set λ = 0.6 in our experiments. With this update, we obtain the improved NE translations considering the relations that an entity has to other entities under the same context to achieve higher precision. 5 Experiments In this section, we present experimental settings and results of translating entity names using our methods compared with several baselines. 5.1 Data and Evaluation We processed news articles for an entire year in 2008 by Xinhua news who publishes news in both English and Chinese, which were also used by Kim et al. (2011) and Shao and Ng (2004). The English corpus consists of 100,746 news articles, and the Chinese corpus consists of 88,031 news articles. The news corpora are not parallel but comparable corpora, with asymmetry of entities and relationship as the asymmetry in the number of documents also suggest. Examples of such locality in Xinhua news include the more extensive coverage of Chinese teams in the Olympics and domestic sports in the Chinese news. Our framework finds and leverages comparable parts from the corpora without document-content-external information such as time stamps. We also show that,</context>

A relational statement, or simply a statement is a triple (x, r, y), representing a relationship between two names, x and y. For example, from “Mandelson recently visited Moscow,” we obtain this statement: (Mandelson, visit, Moscow). We follow a standard procedure to extract statements, as similarly adopted by Nakashole et al. (2012), using Stanford CoreNLP (Klein and Manning, 2003) to lemmatize and parse sentences. Here, we refer readers to existing work for further details because this is not our key contribution. 4.2 Seed Entity Translation We need a few seed translation pairs to initiate the framework.

This method uses only a single type of entities to propagate the translation scores. • TPMH+P is the holistic method revised to use naive multi-type propagation that uses multiple types of entities to reinforce the translation scores. • THB is a linear combination of transliteration and semantic translation methods (Lam et al., 2007) tuned to achieve the highest MRR. • TDict is a dictionary-only method. This dictionary is used by both THB and TN. Only the translation pairs of scores above 0.35 are used for TPH+P to maximize the F1-score to measure precision, recall and F1-score.

Semantically similar relation mining Recently, similar relation mining in one language has been studied actively as a key part of automatic knowledge base construction. In automatically constructed knowledge bases, finding semantically similar relations can improve understanding of the Web describing content with many different expressions. As such an effort, PATTY (Nakashole et al., 2012) finds similar relations with almost the same support sets–the sets of NE pairs that co-occur with the relations.

In Section 4.5, we describe how we use the resources obtained so far to improve NE translation. 4.1 Statement Extraction We extract relational statements, which we exploit to propagate translation scores, from an English news corpus and a Chinese news corpus. A relational statement, or simply a statement is a triple (x, r, y), representing a relationship between two names, x and y. For example, from “Mandelson recently visited Moscow,” we obtain this statement: (Mandelson, visit, Moscow). We follow a standard procedure to extract statements, as similarly adopted by Nakashole et al. (2012), using Stanford CoreNLP (Klein and Manning, 2003) to lemmatize and parse sentences. Here, we refer readers to existing work for further details because this is not our key contribution. 4.2 Seed Entity Translation We need a few seed translation pairs to initiate the framework. We build a seed translation score T(1) N (eE, eC) indicating the similarity of an English entity eE and a Chinese entity eC using an existing method. For example, most methods would give high value for English Corpus Chinese Corpus (b) Seed Entity Translation TN1 (Section 4.2) (a) Statement Extraction (Section 4.1) Iter</context>

With this update, we obtain the improved NE translations considering the relations that an entity has to other entities under the same context to achieve higher precision. 5 Experiments In this section, we present experimental settings and results of translating entity names using our methods compared with several baselines. 5.1 Data and Evaluation We processed news articles for an entire year in 2008 by Xinhua news who publishes news in both English and Chinese, which were also used by Kim et al. (2011) and Shao and Ng (2004). The English corpus consists of 100,746 news articles, and the Chinese corpus consists of 88,031 news articles. The news corpora are not parallel but comparable corpora, with asymmetry of entities and relationship as the asymmetry in the number of documents also suggest. Examples of such locality in Xinhua news include the more extensive coverage of Chinese teams in the Olympics and domestic sports in the Chinese news. Our framework finds and leverages comparable parts from the corpora without document-content-external information such as time stamps. We also show that, under the decreasing c</context>

Moreover, our method shows robustness, with 0.14 higher MRR than seed translations, on less comparable corpora. 632 2 Related Work This work is related to two research streams: NE translation and semantically equivalent relation mining. Entity translation Existing approaches on NE translation can be categorized into 1) transliteration-based, 2) corpusbased, and 3) hybrid approaches. Transliteration-based approaches (Wan and Verspoor, 1998; Knight and Graehl, 1998) are the foundations of many decent methods, but they alone suffer from ambiguity (e.g., 史 蒂 夫 and 始第夫 have the same sounds) and cannot handle non-transliterated cases such as ‘Jackie Chan (成龙[ChengLong])’. Some methods (Lam et al., 2007; Yang et al., 2009) rely on meanings of constituent letters or words to handle organization name translation such as ‘Bank of China (中国 银行)’, whose translation is derived from ‘China (中 国)’, and ‘a bank (银 行)’.

However, not all NE translations are based on transliterations, as shown in Table 1—Some translations, especially the names of most organizations, are based on semantic equivalences. Furthermore, names can be abbreviated in one or both languages, e.g., the ‘World Trade Organization’ (世 界贸易组织) can be called the ‘WTO’ (世贸组 织). Another challenging example is that, a translation can be arbitrary, e.g., ‘Jackie Chan’ -+ ‘成 龙’ [ChengLong].

However, we found that a topic is a unit that is too coarse for this task because most articles on Mandelson will invariably fall into the same topic&apos;. In clear contrast, we selectively propagate seed translations, only when the relations in the two corpora share the same semantics. This selective propagation can be especially effective for translating challenging types of entities such as organizations including the WTO used with and without abbreviation in both languages. Applying a holistic approach (You et al., 2012) on organizations leads to poor results, 0.06 in terms of the F1-score. A naive approach to increase the precision would be to consider multitype co-occurrences, hoping that highly precise translations of some type, e.g., persons with an F1-score of 0.69 (You et al., 2012), can be propagated to boost the precision on organizations. In our experiments, this naive multi-type propagation still leads to an unsatisfactory F1-score of 0.12. Such a low score can be explained by the following example.
