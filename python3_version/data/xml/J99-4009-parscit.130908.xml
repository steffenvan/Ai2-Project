George Lakoff and Mark Johnson begin with three sentences that summarize and
characterize their book:
The mind is inherently embodied.
Thought is mostly unconscious.
Abstract concepts are largely metaphorical.
Part I supports these sentences with findings from cognitive science &amp;quot;that human
reason is a form of animal reason, a reason inextricably tied to our bodies and the
peculiarities of our brains&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;that our bodies, brains, and interactions with our en-
vironment provide the mostly unconscious basis for our everyday metaphysics, that
is, our sense of what is real.&amp;quot; The third sentence is a summary of their earlier work
on metaphor (Lakoff and Johnson 1980), which in Part II of this book they extend to
a more detailed analysis of the metaphors underlying basic philosophical issues, such
as time, events and causes, mind, self, and morality. Part III applies that analysis to
the metaphors tacitly assumed by philosophers ranging from the Presocratics to Noam
Chomsky. Part IV presents arguments for &amp;quot;empirically responsible philosophy&amp;quot; and
its potential for understanding &amp;quot;who we are, how we experience our world, and how
we ought to live.&amp;quot; Finally, the appendix summarizes research inspired by this phi-
losophy that has produced computational simulations of certain aspects of embodied
minds.
Given such a broad scope, the authors have not been able to cover all the topics
with equal success. Instead of challenging all of western philosophy, they should have
concentrated on their major opponent, Noam Chomsky and his philosophy of lan-
guage. Lakoff began his career in linguistics as a student and later a teacher of Chom-
sky&apos;s version of transformational grammar. But in the late 1960s, he joined with other
former students to promote generative semantics as an alternative to Chomsky&apos;s gener-
ative syntax. The result was a series of &amp;quot;linguistic wars,&amp;quot; whose history has been retold
by various participants over the past twenty years. Chapter 22 of this book presents
a strong case against Chomsky&apos;s &amp;quot;autonomous syntax&amp;quot; and for an approach that
bases syntax on semantics and semantics on the bodily mechanisms of perception and
action.
The philosophical and linguistic arguments of Chapter 22 are reinforced in the
appendix by a summary of the Neural Theory of Language (NTL), which is being de-
veloped by Jerome Feldman, George Lakoff, Lokendra Shastri, and their students. To
date, the NTL group has undertaken three major tasks in language understanding

and learning:
1. For his dissertation on learning spatial relations, Terry Regier (1996)
started with the cross-linguistic analyses of spatial relations by Len
Talmy (1983). Regier failed in his first attempts to get a conventional
PDP (parallel distributed processing) network to learn spatial relations,
such as ABOVE and IN. He later developed a hybrid system with a
simulation of human perceptual mechanisms as a front-end to a PDP
network for learning.
2. For learning verbs of hand motion, David Bailey (1997) started with Jack,
a computer simulation of the muscles and joints of the human body. To
represent motor schemas, Bailey collaborated with another student, Srini
Narayanan, to adapt Petri nets to represent the real-time control of hand
motions. Then Bailey used a PDP network to learn which combinations
of Jack&apos;s motions were associated with verbs in English, Farsi, Russian,
and Hebrew.
3. For motor control and abstract aspectual reasoning, Narayanan (1997)
discovered systematic patterns of Petri nets that could be tailored to
represent most, if not all, bodily movements. Those patterns correspond
to the aspectual features of verbs, which have long been studied by
linguists. Then Narayanan showed how the same patterns used to
interpret Jack&apos;s bodily motions could be used to interpret metaphors,
such as France falls into a recession, Germany pulls it out, and India releases the
stranglehold on business.

By showing the importance of the human motor and perceptual mechanisms for lan-
guage understanding, these studies give concrete meaning to the catchphrase embodied
mind. The &amp;quot;neural&amp;quot; metaphor, however, is not entirely justified, since the computational
mechanisms that support these systems are mostly classical. Jack incorporates standard
computational simulations; Petri nets are a distributed processing model commonly
used to simulate multithreaded operating systems; and PDP networks are statistical
computing systems that have only a remote resemblance to actual neurons. A more
appropriate acronym might be VRTL, for Virtual Reality Theory of Language.
For the other philosophers discussed in Part III, the treatment is often brief to
the point of dangerous overgeneralization. Whereas the authors devote 44 pages to
Chomsky, they cover all of &amp;quot;Anglo-American analytic philosophy&amp;quot; in 29 pages, while
lumping together Frege, Russell, Carnap and the Vienna Circle, Quine, Goodman,
Davidson, Putnam, Kripke, Montague, and Lewis. In the same chapter, they continue
with ordinary language philosophy (Strawson, Austin, and the later Wittgenstein),
which they consider to be based on the same metaphors. Yet these philosophers have
expressed widely divergent views on the embodiment of mind, the nature of lan-
guage, and Chomsky&apos;s theory of autonomous syntax. By drawing finer distinctions,
the authors might have claimed some of them as potential allies against Chomsky&apos;s
position.
For the classical philosophers, the authors use their terminology of metaphors and
folk theories to make a rather conventional commentary seem novel. Plato, they claim,
&amp;quot;had the metaphor Essences As Ideas, Aristotle has the converse metaphor, Ideas Are
Essences.&amp;quot; No philosopher who hopes to be &amp;quot;empirically responsible&amp;quot; should make
such statements without much-deeper analysis of how those metaphors relate to the
words that Plato and Aristotle actually used. In their discussion of Aristotle&apos;s theory

of causation, they fail to distinguish Aristotle&apos;s notion of aitia and the Latin translation
causa from the modern English word cause, which has undergone profound shifts of
meaning in Newton&apos;s mechanics, Hume&apos;s philosophy, and more recent theories of rela-
tivity and quantum mechanics. They also apply the same term formal logic to Aristotle&apos;s
syllogisms and to all the modern logicians, despite the widely divergent opinions that
the modern logicians have expressed about Aristotle and about each other.
A glaring omission in a book on embodied minds that discusses Aristotle is the
failure to mention his theory of the psyche, which is the earliest and one of the best
characterizations of the embodied mind. Aristotle defined the psyche as the logos or
principle that determines what it is for something to be a living entity. Instead of a
single principle of the psyche that covers all living things, Aristotle defined a hierarchy
of six functions, each of which is a prerequisite for all the subsequent ones: nutrition,
perception, desire, locomotion, imagery, and reason. He maintained that plants have
a psyche that is limited to the nutritive function, sponges to the first three functions,
worms to the first four, and the higher nonhuman animals to the first five. In having
reason, the human psyche requires all the others as prerequisites. Aristotle&apos;s theory is
consistent with Lakoff and Johnson&apos;s criterion (p. 17) for a theory of embodied mind:
&amp;quot;There is no such fully autonomous faculty of reason separate from and independent
of bodily capacities such as perception and movement. The evidence supports, instead,
an evolutionary view, in which reason uses and grows out of bodily capacities.&amp;quot;
Aristotle&apos;s hierarchy bears a striking resemblance to the levels of competence that
Rodney Brooks (1986) defined for mobile robots: avoiding, wandering, exploring, map-
ping, noticing, reasoning, planning, and anticipating. Since all of Brooks&apos;s robots have
locomotion, Aristotle&apos;s theory predicts that they must also have nutrition (the ability
to recharge their batteries), perception (at least at the level of touch), and desire (a
preference that determines goals). The first four functions are sufficient to support the
competence levels of avoiding, wandering, and exploring. Imagery is necessary to sup-
port mapping and noticing, and thought is necessary to support reasoning, planning,
and anticipating. The lower levels of Aristotle&apos;s hierarchy could support sedentary
agents, such as thermostats and alarm clocks.
The most irritating feature of the book is the authors&apos; repeated claims of nov-
elty, either for themselves or for their colleagues. A typical example is the following
paragraph on page 10:
Cognitive science is the scientific discipline that studies conceptual
systems. It is a relatively new discipline, having been founded in the
1970s. Yet in a short time it has made startling discoveries. It has
discovered, first of all, that most of our thought is unconscious, not in
the Freudian sense of being repressed, but in the sense that it operates
beneath the level of cognitive awareness, inaccessible to consciousness
and operating too quickly to be focussed on.
By dismissing Freud&apos;s theory of the unconscious as irrelevant, the authors try to make
the recent work sound more &amp;quot;startling.&amp;quot; Yet the literature contains well-documented
examples of prior art. Among the best is William James&apos;s two-volume textbook The
Principles of Psychology, which, in 1890, devoted many pages to the processes that op-
erate beneath the level of cognitive awareness. James supported his presentation with
explicit citations of experimental evidence, including reaction-time studies. On the
cover of the 1965 reprint, one of the reviewers remarked &amp;quot;Rereading James brings a
sense of perspective and even a little humility to our regard for more modern achieve-
ments.&amp;quot;

In summary, this book makes an important contribution to the ongoing debates
about the roles of syntax, semantics, and world knowledge in language understanding
and their dependency on the physical world and the human mechanisms for perceiv-
ing, interpreting, and interacting with the world. Its major weakness is its tendency to
exclude other perspectives, such as Aristotle&apos;s, which can accommodate both formal
logic and a theory of embodied mind. Although the authors frequently use the word
neural, none of their discussion depends on the actual structure or method of opera-
tion of a neuron. NTL could with equal justification be considered an acronym for a
Neoaristotelian Theory of Language.

Part I supports these sentences with findings from cognitive science &amp;quot;that human reason is a form of animal reason, a reason inextricably tied to our bodies and the peculiarities of our brains&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;that our bodies, brains, and interactions with our environment provide the mostly unconscious basis for our everyday metaphysics, that is, our sense of what is real.&amp;quot; The third sentence is a summary of their earlier work on metaphor (Lakoff and Johnson 1980), which in Part II of this book they extend to a more detailed analysis of the metaphors underlying basic philosophical issues, such as time, events and causes, mind, self, and morality. Part III applies that analysis to the metaphors tacitly assumed by philosophers ranging from the Presocratics to Noam Chomsky. Part IV presents arguments for &amp;quot;empirically responsible philosophy&amp;quot; and its potential for understanding &amp;quot;who we are, how we experience our world, and how we ought to live.&amp;quot; Finally, the appendix summarizes research inspired by this philosophy that has produced computational simulations</context>

For learning verbs of hand motion, David Bailey (1997) started with Jack, a computer simulation of the muscles and joints of the human body. To represent motor schemas, Bailey collaborated with another student, Srini Narayanan, to adapt Petri nets to represent the real-time control of hand motions. Then Bailey used a PDP network to learn which combinations of Jack&apos;s motions were associated with verbs in English, Farsi, Russian, and Hebrew. 3. For motor control and abstract aspectual reasoning, Narayanan (1997) discovered systematic patterns of Petri nets that could be tailored to represent most, if not all, bodily movements. Those patterns correspond to the aspectual features of verbs, which have long been studied by linguists. Then Narayanan showed how the same patterns used to interpret Jack&apos;s bodily motions could be used to interpret metaphors, such as France falls into a recession, Germany pulls it out, and India releases the stranglehold on business. By showing the importance of the human motor and perceptual mechanisms for language understanding, these studies give concrete meaning to the cat</context>
