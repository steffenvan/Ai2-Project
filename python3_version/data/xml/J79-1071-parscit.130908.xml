The task for the semantic analysis of sentences with SR&apos;s is to make clear what is
being positioned. This has been difficult to do. Previous proposals have left
unanalyzed many phenomena including important motional references. This paper&apos;s
main conclusion is that a much improved analysis can be obtained by representing
the SR&apos;s as positioning abstract events and states of affairs.
The analysis in semantic nets has the location of an event or state tf
affairs represented as a node which is linked to the node showing the event or
state by arcs indicating its status as the spatial attribute. A few SR&apos;s are
shown as naming these locational entities, which wP call place object. These
SR&apos;s involve examples with &amp;quot;where&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;here&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;there&amp;quot;. However, most SR&apos;s are
represented as relating place objects to the position of objects in the manner of
prepositional phrases. This primacy of prepositions is argued for in the paper.
Motional references are allowed for by functions represented in the nets which
produce parts of place objects which are then positioned by prepositional forms.
The necessary ordering that comes with motional references is allowed for by
associating temporal elements with the functions.
While the positioned elements are simple, the overall semantic structure of
the sentences containing SR&apos;s is often complicated by the involyement of more
than one event or state of affairs. The paper includes a survey of the sentential
5,
semantic structures necessary to deal Idth SR&apos;s. A similar complexity is
necessary to deal with the information on the location of objects which is gained
from sentences with SR&apos;s. The paper suggests the use of inference rules to allow
for this.
The most surprising of the paper&apos;s conclusions is that a strong tie exists
between references to space and temporal information. In fact, the locations of
all events and states of affairs placed by SR&apos;s are argued to be locations in both
space and time. The effect of thie conclusion is most clearly seen in a
formalized definition of the primitives of the semantic structures, which is also
presented in semantic nets. There, as one possible interpretation of the place
object, it is shown as a set of pairs of volumes in space and points in time.
The paver has nine sections following this one. In the first, the
limitations of previous analyses of the semantic function of SR&apos;s is considered.
Then in one section, the semantic net formalism and, in the next, the syntactic
distinctions used in the study are introduced. The next four sections present
eyer more complex situations. The first section shows simple direct analyses
involving one event or state. The next section presents complex sentential
structures with non-movement SR&apos;s. Motional references are analyzed in the next.
The connection between time and SR&apos;s is discussed in the fourth section.
Following these analyses of sentential semantic structures, a section is given
over to the formalization of the definition of the structures used. The paper
ends with a discussion of the limitations of the proposal and possible extensions
to it.
There is available a discussion in greater detail of a preliminary analysis
to the one given here (Sondheimer, 1975). There is also available for comparison
an analy is by this author of the sane meaning phenomena, in the competing
paradigm of model-theoretic semantics (Sondheimer, 1978). The current

rhe paAt has seen many studies of SR phenomena. There has been interest in
connecting. language and scenes, e.g., Coles (1968), Kochen (1969), Winograd
(1972), Badlci (1975), and Tsotsos (1976). The use of langdage to capture the
&apos;spatial St.rtuture of the physical world has been studied, e.g., Hobbs (1975) and
Kuiper (197&apos;). The conceptual structure of the terms used in SR and the
pragmatics of, evaluating them has been studied, e.g., Cooper (1968), Bennett
(1975), and Denof sky (1976). Finally a number of studies have considered our
topic: the position of a SR within the semantic structure of a sentence.
Studies of our sort tend to be distinguishable by the typo of entities SR&apos;s
are claimed to locate. In some cases, the SR&apos;s apply to only physical objects..
In others, they apply to only abstract forms identifying events and states o
affairs. A broad third type of analysis shows different sorts of entities being
modified. Each has.its limitations.

II.1 Analyses Using Physical Objects
The paradigmatic phenomenon for the analyses that claim physical objects as
the referents of SR&apos;s is the noun phrase modifier:
2.1 The man in the car left.
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.973778125">
The SR in the above is the phrase &amp;quot;in the car&amp;quot;. The proposals of Norman and
Rumelhart (1975), Abrahamson (1975), Geis (1975a, b, anc c) and Schubert (1916),
among others, would try to show the relation of the SR to &amp;quot;the wan&amp;quot; directly.
Figure 2.1 illustrates the typical structure in the style of Schubert (1976).
This figure shows &amp;quot;the man&amp;quot; being located (LOC) at a time, indicated by the T
link, and at a location which was in &amp;quot;the car&amp;quot;.
This style of analysis seems simple and direct. It appeals to the intuition
that only physical objects take up space. It promises to be easy to apply,

since all that is required is to associate SR&apos;s with the sentential elements
which are modified which reference physical objects. Unfortunately, there are
problems.
It can be difficult to find all or any objects with which to associate an SR.
Often there is more to an event than just its participants&apos; locations:

<bodyText confidence="0.9986106">
If we hear example 2.2 then more than John is known to be in the basement. His
cards are, for example. Further, the location of the action is more than the
instantaneous position of John and his cards. For example, space where the cards
may potentially be placed must be included. Similarly, the following does not
indicate that John is next to the school:

<bodyText confidence="0.6107488">
in both the above examples, only complex analyses showing many understood and
potential participants can allow fox object-reference.
Allowing for motional sentences is a very serious problem for object-
referenee analyses. The typical proposal is to show motion as change from one
static location to another:
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.852599222222222">
2.6 The man walked from New York to Chicago.
Example 2.6 would be shown as a man&apos;s walking causing a change of location from
New York to Chicago. Some sentences show intermediate points:
2.7 The man walked from New York to Chicago via Pittsburgh.
Here, successive changes seem to be appropriate. However, one class of
references to motion seems to defeat this entire approach:
2.8 The man walked across the puddle.
2.9 The man walked around the puddle.
2.10 The man walked through the puddle.
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.974792333333333">
Examples like the above involve duration in a key way and can not be shown with
reference to one position. For example, at no time was the man &amp;quot;across&amp;quot; the
puddle like Raleigh&apos;s cloak was across it. Similarly, two points showing the
man&apos;s change of position are inadequate since the same initial and final
positions are atceptable in all three cases. Finally, adding an intermediate
point will not be adequate, since the man might reach that point while on a path
that otherwise holds a different relation to the puddle. As shall be seen, the
lesson to be learned from these examples is that in allowing for motion, it is the
entire path tbrat must be considered and not selected positions of objects.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.734101">
11.2 Analyses Using Events and States of Affairs
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9827675">
A second uniform type of analysis postulates events and states of affairs as
the subject of SR&apos;s (see for example, Davidson, 1967, Lakoff, 1970, and Harman,
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.99501425">
072). Events and states of affairs are said to be the two types of situations
that utterances describe. Taking them ae the subjectsof SR&apos;s claims that it is
not the participants but the overall situation that is being referenced. This
can be seen in Figure 2.2, which shows one of Davidson&apos;s analyses in a semantic
net notation. The diagram shows that there is a strolling by John which has a
particular time and space coordinate. The benefits of this analysis include the
independence of event and state existence from discussion of spatial location,
the ability to handle location of vaguely bounded events and states, and the
simplicity of application. However, again the simple direct methods that have
been proposed are unsatisfactory.
It is often difficult to simply associate SR&apos;d with a central event or state
since SR&apos;s in some utterances must modify different entities:

2.12 John walked from his car across the yard to the house.

How the event of 2.12 can be &amp;quot;from&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;across&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;to&amp;quot; simultaneously and also
have these aspects temporally ordered is nowhere explained in these analyses.
Finally, even if SR&apos;s are associated with events and states of affairs, the fact
that something is often learned about participants&apos; location must be explained.
For example, from the sentence of Figure .2.2, the fact that John was in the
streets of Bologna is clear, but from the semantic structure only the location of
the strolling is clear. No coherent way has been presented to allow for this kind
of relationship.

le.3 Nonuniform Analyses
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.926413826086957">
The third style of SR analysis is nonuniform in nature. These either mix
the two uniform analyses or elaborate on the simple event or state analysis.
Mixed analyses claim that some SR&apos;s locate concrete objects while some locate
events or states of affairs (see for example, Winograd, 1972, and Schank, 1973)
By sacrificing the simplicity that comes from uniformity, these analyses avoid
the uniform analyses&apos; complementary problems. However, the mutual problems,
especially motion, are left unsolved.
The nonuniform analyses that elaborate on the nature of events and states of
affairs are best represented by Case analyses, see Bruce (1975). They claim that
either the overall location or specific aspects of events and states are located.
Taking Fillmore (1971), as opposed to the better known but earlier Fillmore
(1968), as the model, four spatial cases can be seen. An SR can either reference
a static location (the Location case), place of origin (the Source case), place&apos;
of termination (the Goal case), or location of intermediate motion (the Path
case). In terms of events and states of affairs, the first case can either be
12
used for overall event or state location or it may be used to locate an aspect of
the event. The final three cases all relate to different aspects of a motional
event. This allows for examples like 2.12, with inherent temporal ordering among
the cases allowing for the ordering of the SR&apos;s.
The Case analyses still has problems. The two uses of the static case
conflict in sentences with two static locations such as the one where the ice bag
is held to the man&apos;s head while the man and ice bag are said to be in the car. Two
instances of the Location case seem to be required, but if both appear, there is
no way to identify their differing function. Also, motion is still troublesome.
As Fillmore (1971) points out, instances such as the underlined phrases in the
following seem to indicate a need for an unbounded number of instances of the
Path cases:
2.13 He walked down the hill across the bridge
throush the pasture to the chapel.
The underlined phrases refer to motion ordered in time, e.g., he walked the hill
before the bridge. However, Case analysis gives no way to order instances of the
same case. Gruber (1965) points out the same problem with the Goal case:
2.14 I walked to New York to my mother&apos;s.
Finally, the Case proposal must be given some physical interpretation. Any
representation of meaning must at some point be related to a model of the world.
In this instance the idea of a source, goal, and path must be somehow related to
models of motion.
This paper presents a proposal for an analysis that is nonuniform in the
same way the Case analysis is. A uniform source for locations modified by SR&apos;s is
given, but the predication of these spaces by SR&apos;s is shown to be much more
complex than previously thought. Futther, sentences are not seen as being as
13
simple with respect to SR&apos;s as previously supposed. Before presenting the
analysis, two sections will be devoted to preliminary topics: our semantic net
formalism and the syntactic status of the phenomena considered.

III. Semantic Nets
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.973821473684211">
The resdlts of this analysis of SR phenomenaare formalized in semantic nets
or networks. This formalism is currently a popular choice for semantic analyses.
It allows clear, expressive graphic presentations and possesses many positive
computational properties. Because of its popularity, it also allows wide
dissemination of ideas. Working against this last claim is the proliferation of
versions of the representation, for example, Hendrix (1976), Norman and Rumelhart
(1975), Shapiro (1971), Simmons (1973), and Woods (1975). This section clarifies
what is meant here by the formalism, which can be seen to most closely resemble
that of Brachman (1977).
Semantic nets have been used for representing many aspects of Entelligence.
Often they are used to represent factual information concerning objects, actions,
and states. They have separately been used to show the semantic structure of
utterances It is this use that mainly interests us. However, there is a
connection between the two uses. All semantic structures must be related to
structures that represent facutal information and each use of a type of object,
event, or state of affair must be related to a concept that explains it. This can
be thought of as paralleling the relationship between a semantic structure shown
in the predrcate calculus and a model in which that structure has a truth value.
In a complete net, the above translates into the necessity of nodes for
concepts representing types of events, states of affairs, and objects and nodes
for instances of tokens of these concepts. The &amp;quot;token&amp;quot; nodes must link to &amp;quot;type&amp;quot;
nodes that define Chem. These definitions must include specification of attri-
butes of an instance in terms of restrictions on values, functional role of the(&apos;
attribute, and other things. The instance nodes must be connected to instantia-
tions of the attributes. Concept nodes must also be related to ether concepts.,
have overall structural conditions, locate inference rules that may apply, etc.
All this information is essential to any artificially intelligent entity, just as
15
the model is essential&apos;to any analysis in the predicate calculus. However, for
showing the serif:antic relations in which we are mainly interested, an abbreviation
is sufficient just as only the formulas are sufficient in most studies using
symbolic logic. Hence a special abbreviation will be used in all sections except
IL where the definitional level will be discussed.
Central to our abbreviation will be nodes that collapse types and tokens.
These will identify the verbal concepts that characterize the events and states
of affairs. We will call them &amp;quot;event/state&amp;quot; nodes. They will be circled and
capital letters will be used for abstract types, such as CAUSING. Nonabstract
forms will be shown with names that suggest the interpretation, e.g., Sleeping
will suggest the sleeping state. When a node represents a physical object,
identifying information will be included in quotes, e.g., &amp;quot;the bus&amp;quot;. Names
placed on arcs will abbreviate and suggest the functional roles of attributes.
For example, ANTE for antecedent and CONS for consequence will be used with
CAUSING. Case names will be used with many event and state of affairs types.
These will include:
for &amp;quot;Time&amp;quot; showing the time an event occurred or state held.
A for &amp;quot;Agent&amp;quot; showing the instigator of an event or state.
0 for &amp;quot;Object&amp;quot;, the neutral case (as Fillmore (1971) explains
it &amp;quot;the wastebasket&amp;quot;).
Restrictions on types of entities which will be necessary will be shown by non-
oval shapes for nodes. For example, time instances will be shown in parentheses
and time intervals in square brackets. Finally, because it is not essential for
our purposes, specification of time will often be left out of most semantic
structures. Similarly, we will consider only declarative statements. Figure 3.1
shows a typical structure.
Some concepts that act as functions will also be used. Each of these will
look like a relation associating parameters with a value. The value will be
identified by a VALUE arc. Inference rules will be presented in the form of

&amp;quot;subnet1&amp;quot; &amp;quot;subnet21&apos;, where on seeing subneti, subnet2 is to be added to the
semantic net. These rules will include variables within nodes, where the
variables are to be bound on matching and referenced on inferencing. These
variables will be in the form of capital letters, e.g., X.
To summarize, our semantic net formalism uses concept names, descriptions of
objects, mnemonic arc names, and mnemonic shapes for nodes to abbreviate the twct
levels in a semantic net. Also used are functions and inference rules. This will
be enough to represent the semantic relations involving reference to space that
are being considered. Unfortunately, it is one more unique formalism. However,
it stdds no new structures, only abbreviating others. We leave as an unproven
claim that it will fit in with any formalism which shows identifiable event and
state of affairs nodes such as Norman add Rumelhart (1975) and Schank (1973).

IV. The S, ntactic Structure of S atial References and the Primac of Pre ositions
Semantic structure is the topic of our paper, but the syntactic structure of
sentences with SR s is also important. Its consideration clarifies the range of
phenomena being studied. With SR, the basic syntactic structures involve
prepositional phrases. All other SR are analyzable in terms of these structures.
In this section, the syntax function of prepositional phrases will be considered
and arguments for their primacy will be presented.
Our main interest in syntax is in structuring our discussion of semantics.
However, the problems of parsing and generation make the syntax of SR&apos;s indepen-
dently important. These are not our topics here. However, in an earlier issue of
this journal we presented a parsing scheme that produces semantic from syntactic
structure and applied the scheme to current class of phenomena (Sondheimer and
Perry, 1975).

IV.1 Locative Prepositions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9912065">
Prepositional phrases that express SR&apos;s can be called locative. They appear
contiguously, as in example 4.1, or discontiguously, as in example 4.2:
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.9424445">
4.1 I put it on table.
4.2 The table I put it on is broken.
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999719428571429">
The discontiguous example can be taken as derivable from (reducible to) the
contiguous forms in generation (interpretation). Hence only contiguous examples
will be considered. These are primarily employed in four syntactic roles:
complement, quhlifier, adjunct, and locative object. There is also one special
dependent usage that will be described at the end of this section.
The complement usage of locative prepositions arises only when they are the
&amp;quot;complement&amp;quot; of the verb &amp;quot;be&amp;quot;:

Quirk et al., (1972)&apos;distinguishes them from predicate adjective and nominal
18
usages. Locative objects and adjuncts with copulative sentences can be dis-
tinguished from complements by the presence of these adjectives and noun phrases:

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.9153485">
4.4 There are lions in Africa.
4.5 He wits important in Chicago.
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.881813">
The qualifier usage of locative prepositions is part of noun phrases and
shows the location of the reference of the noun phrase:
4.6 The man in no car left.
The strings in some sentences may make it appear that locative prepositions are
part of noun phrases when they are not:
4.7 I put the knife on the table.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.736808">
4.8 She took care of John in Chicago.
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.924993947368421">
In these cases, the passive test and cleft-sentence test (Jacobs and Rosenbaum,
1968, p. 38) can be applied:
4.9 *The knife on the table was put by me.
4.10 *What I put was he knife on the table.
4.11 *John in Chicago was taken care of by her.
4.12 *What she took care of was John in Chicago.
The asterisk &amp;quot;*&amp;quot; here and throughout marks ungrammatical sentences. The ungram-
maticality of the above examples indicate that the strings in question are not
noun phrases. Hence the prepositional phrases cannot be qualifiers.
Adjunct usages are prepositional phrases that are external to the clause of
a sentence:
4.13 I met John on the train.
Locative object usages are objects of verbs and internal to clauses:
4.14 I put the lamp in the corner.
4.15 He yelled at John.
4.16 He saw her in the park.
There is some controversy on the distinction between these two types. We can
present two syntactic and one semantic classification procedures. First,
adjuncts are never required for grammaticality, while locative objects can be:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.273295666666667">
19
4.17 I met John.
4.18 *I put the lamp.
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9850585">
Second, adjuncts always allow shifting to presubject position without loss of
grammaticality or shift in meaning:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.2804365">
4.19 On the train I met John.
4.20 *At John, he yelled.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.948346777777778">
4.21 In the park, he saw her.
Note that in 4.21, the man is definitely placed while in one interpretation of
4.16, the locative object one, he is not.
Semantically, we claim that adjuncts locate the entirety of events and
states discussed, while locative objects can locate only part of what is
described. For example, in 4.16, the locative object reading shows only the
woman&apos;s position in the park, not the location of the &amp;quot;seeing&amp;quot; as a whole. The
following is also informative:
4.22 He dropped it behind the door.
4.23 Behind the door, he dropped it.
Both examples are similarly ambiguous with respect to the SR. One sense, the
most likely to be identified in 4.22, is that the end result of the dropping was
that the object came to be behind the door. The second sense, the most likely for
4.23, is that the dropping took place behind the door. The first sense shows
partial predication and a locative object usage. The second shows overall
predication and an adjunct usage.
Some forma that seem to be adjuncts do not at first glance appear to make
overall predication:
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.6739485">
4.24 On the train, he commented on the Empire State Building.
4.25 In Chicago, John wrote to his mother.
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.99638225">
The Empire State Building&apos;s and John&apos;s mother&apos;s position are independent of the
train and Chicago. However, we can claim there is still overall predication
since the commenting and the writing were done on the train and in Chicago,
respectively.
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.51766475">
20
Durational adjuncts also complicate the semantic test:
4.26 He cried through the tunnel.
4.27 He sat still from New York to Chicago.
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.913093809523809">
rhese prepositional forms show duration of the crying and sitting and should be
taken as adjuncts. The first gives overall predication. The second example
shows two phrases that individually give partial predication. However, together
they give overall predication. Further, they cannot be used individually:
4.28 *He sat still from New York.
4.29 *He sat still to Chicago.
These are the four primary uses of locative prepositions. We claim that the
semantic structure of other SR&apos;s can be represented through these forms. We will
now show this. In general, this will be done by observing the SR&apos;s structure or
by paraphrase arguments.
IV.2 Other Spatial References as Locative Prepositions
Some spatial terms can have syntactic and semantic functions similar to
prepositions in that they directly serve to relate two forms:
4.30 San Francisco is north of Los Angeles.
4.31 The car is to the left of the building.
These examples can immediately be given prepositional-like semantic structures.
In other sentences, these terms appear as nouns and adjectives:
4.32 The North is desolate.
4.33 He hit my left leg.
Here, the forms can be paraphrased in the prepositional-like form which can be
taken as their underlying semantic form:
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.16022">
4.34 The part of the country to the north of the rest is desolate.
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.75931575">
4.35 He hit one of my legs that is to the left of the other.
Another category, the locative prepositional adverbs, although lacking syntactic
objects have assumed semantic objects. This is shown by our ability to question
the missing object, which is a means for distinguishing this category from verb
</bodyText>
<table confidence="0.914764583333333">
21
particles (Quirk et al., 1972, p. 103):
4.36 He went up.
4.37 Up what did he go?
438 He picked it up.
4.39 Up what did he pick it?
A diverse variety of non-prepositional locative adverbs can be handled with
prepositional forms. Assumed obiects can also be seen in oases of paired
prepositianal-adverbs and prepositions. These are suggested in parentheses
below:
4.40 He walked across (a walkable space) to the blackboard.
4.41 He jumped from (a jumpable place which was on) the table.
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.870369">
Some adverbs can be straightforwardly treated as the equivalent of prepositional
phrases. These appear as the concatenation of a preposition and a noun and refer
to the spatial relation referenced by the preposition with respect to the type of
object referenced by the noun:
4.42 He ran uphill.
4.43 He is overseas.
The suffix &amp;quot;-ward&amp;quot; following a preposition or preposition-like term produces an
adverb that can be treated as having a destinational- or orientational-like
meaning as shown by the following,paraphrases:
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.42954925">
4.44 He moved leftward.
4.45 He moved to the left.
4.46 It pointed upward.
4.47 It pointed up the space.
Other adverbs can be treated as having a neutral prepositional sense like &amp;quot;at&amp;quot; or
&amp;quot;to&amp;quot; in their semantic representation:
4.48 He is home.
4.49 He is at home.
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.923668666666667">
Finally, many noun phrases that indicate position can be seen as having preposi-
tions subsumed by the verbs they appear with and hence can be represented as
containing prepositional phrases, see Gruber (1965) for elaboration:
</bodyText>
<table confidence="0.699143">
4.50 He gave Susan the ball.
4.51 He gave the ball to Susan.
4.52 He jumped the fence.
4.53 He jumped over the fence.
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.968648">
There are a few forma in SR&apos;s that I can not always claim to be represented
by prepositional forms These are &amp;quot;where&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;here&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;there&amp;quot;, and measures of
distance. These will be dealt with separately. In generals we will deal wieh
prepositioaal phrases with the assumption that all SR phenomena are covered.
Beyond the examples already giltn, it is hard to say what should be
considered an SR. Adjectives such as &amp;quot;long&amp;quot;.and &amp;quot;fat&amp;quot; involve the abstract
properties of objects more than their properties as objects momentarily situated
at a point in space. Many examples apyear to be metaphors of SR or make oblique
reference to spgce:
4.54 I stood trial.
4.55 I go to Ohio State.
All of these will be ignored. Doubtlessly, there are unarguable cases of SR that
are being overlooked. For this, I can only apologize.
IV.3 Semantic Structure of Prepositional Phrases
Since prepositional forms are the basic method of making SR, their represen-
tation is central to this analysis. They will be given a semantic representation
as concepts relating what is referenced by the SR to their own domplements, see
Figure 4.1. The referenced entity will be identified by the F link for &amp;quot;figure&amp;quot;
and the complement by the G link for &amp;quot;ground&amp;quot; (Talmy, 1975)*. Each prepositional
concept will be defined as comparing the figure&apos;s space to the location of the
ground&apos;s object at the time associated with the figure (Section
*There would have to be a second ground link for &amp;quot;between&amp;quot;:
I left it between the window and the door.

<bodyText confidence="0.877394">
VIII contains more discussion on this point). Prepositional concepts will all be
considered abstract and written in capital letters. The reason abstract forms
are used will become clear in the following sections.
One particular dependent use of the preposition &amp;quot;from&amp;quot; falls outside the
simple pattern shown in Figure 4.1 as well as outside of the four classes of
prepositional usages:
4.56 John is far from home.
4.57 John is across the street from home.
In both of the above, John is distant from home. But in 4.57, John is not across
the street in the usual sense of &amp;quot;across&amp;quot; stretching the width of the street. As
Bennett (1975) points out, the &amp;quot;across&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;from&amp;quot; phrases combine in such a way
that we understand that it is the way that must be travelled in starting from home
and going to John that is &amp;quot;across the street&amp;quot;.* This can be allowed for in
semantic nets with a function, WAY, producing a path through space joining two
points identified by INIT for Initial and FIN for Final links, see Figure 4.2.
For example 4.57, G would identify the street, INIT the home, and FIN where John

is an understood &amp;quot;from point&amp;quot; that must be represented:

the basic and simpler SR&apos;s are analyzed.

V. Static Adjunct, ComOlement and Qualifier Usages
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.985561947368421">
Section I describes our basic claim: the source of the locations being
referenced by SR&apos;s can be represented as being the locations of events and states
of affairs. In this section, this claim is associated with the semantic net
model andapplied to those types of SR&apos;s for which it works immediately. These are
the static adjunct, complement and qualifier usages.
V.1 Basic Structures
In our semantic net model, the locations of events and states of affairs
will be shown as attributes of event/state nodes through arcs leading from the
nodes to locational entities. For each event/state node involved with an SR there
will be only one such arc and locational entity. These arcs will be labelled P to
suggest a spatial attribute or &amp;quot;Place&amp;quot; case. The locational entities will be
referred to as place objects. They are the basis of our analysis. These place
objects can be taken for the time being as volumes in space. The sort of volume
they are will be elaborated upon. Place objects will be identified by boxes.
Figure 5.1 gives a typical diagram.
It must be askedwhether place objects are required in semantic represen-
tations or simply ad hoc creations. The answer is that they are required since
speakers treat them as existing by referring directly to them with some uses of
&amp;quot;where&amp;quot;:
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.9343795">
5.1 Where is John living?
5.2 I found it where John was sleeping.
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9995668">
Place objects can not be outlined strictly in space like a solid can. This
is not important, because there is no way in language to directly and completely
locate any object. In the last section, it was argued that except for &amp;quot;where&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;here&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;there&amp;quot;, every SR is like a preposition. Hence they all give
relative position. With those that do not, &amp;quot;where&amp;quot; can be shown

as referencing place objects not definite locations. &amp;quot;Here&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;there&amp;quot; both
predicate spatial qualities of place objects not specific locations:
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.992661">
5.3 John was born here.
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99997725">
In 5.3, the location of the doing is simply associated with &amp;quot;here&amp;quot;. Hence a
semantic analysis that associates SR with abstract locations can work if the
means of predicating these locations and of fitting them into semantic structures
can be found.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.937793">
V.2 Applying the Analysis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999677333333333">
With the place object, there is a large class of phenomena that can be
represented directly. These include static adjuncts (5.4) as opposed to dura-
tional ones (5.5):
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.949821">
5.4 At the table, John sat without moving.
5.5 From Dallas to Houston j John sat without moving.
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994403">
Similarly, the static complement senses (5.6) as opposed to resultiVe complement
senses (5.7) can be directly represented:
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.343178">
5.6 Chicago is far away from New York.
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.7403688">
5.7 We are finally far away from New York.
Finally, direct analysis can be given to qualifier usages which either apply with
a static sense to nouns describing physical objects (5.8) or act like static
27
adjuncts with respect to verbal nouns (5.9):
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.9818065">
5.8 The.man in the car left.
5.9 Swimming in the lake is fun.
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997729">
These qualifier usages can be contrasted with those that show motion (5.10), act
like locative objects to verbal nouns (5.11) or show extent (5.12):
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.541110666666667">
5.10 The bus to Chicago left.
5.11 Swimming into a cave is fun.
5.12 The bridge from Ohio to West Virginia is old.
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998439">
Applying the place object analysis to static adjuncts is easily defendable.
One test for adjuncts in the last section was to see if it located the entirety of
the event or state discussed. The static adjuncts are identifiable in this way.
Since the place object shows the location of that entirety, static adjuncts can
therefore be directly applied to them. Figure 5,2 gives a typical analysis.
</bodyText>
<note confidence="0.687613">

</note>
<page confidence="0.550067">
28
</page>
<tableCaption confidence="0.870317461538461">
This basic treatment extends to static complement usages. These relate an
object to some location in space and time. To show this an abstract predicate,
BEING-AT, can be postulated whose object case shows an entity whose spatio-
temporal location is specified by Place and Time cases, see Figure 5.3.
Proposing a state of affairs to show an object&apos;s existence in space and time
may at first seem artificial. But in fact, it provides representations isomor-
phic to the usual &amp;quot;direct&amp;quot; representation of object location. For example,
Schubert (1976) uses a concept LOG which by a link A identifies an object, a link
B the object s location, and a link T its time frame (see Figure 2.1). These
match our BEING-AT, 0, P, and T cases, respectively. Schubert sometimes
abbreviates SR&apos;s when the preposition &amp;quot;at&amp;quot; is used. However, this is simply an
abbreviation and his underlying form remains equivalent to ours.
BEING -AT

<bodyText confidence="0.997887428571428">
Static qualifiers parallel either the adjunct or complement analysis. As
an adjunct to verbal noun, we can claim that an event/state corresponding to the
event or state described by the nouns can be located by the SR in the same way as
an actual adjunct. With qualifiers applying to concrete nouns there can be a
BEING-AT event/state showing that the existence in space and time of the object
is being discussed. The qualifier can then modify its place object. This would
then dhow thefollowing equivalently:
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.8494345">
5.13 The man in the car yesterday left.
5.14 The man who was in the car yesterday left.
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9768482">
The possibility of time modification as in 5.13 is good evidence for the
treatment of qualifiers as having underlying complement structure (Winograd,
1972).
V.3 Allowing for Object Position
Now that both adjunct and complement usages have been considered, our method
of allowing for the positioning of objects while representing SR&apos;s as positioning
event/states can be explained. As was discussed in Section II, an event/state
analysis must explain how an artificially intelligent entity can discover that
John was somewhere from the representation of an event or state involving John
being located there. This can be taken as being something like discovering the
appropriateness of the complement form (5.16) from the truth of the adjunct form
(5.15):
5.15 John slept in the kitchen.
5.16 John was in the kitchen.
Within the computational paradigm, the discovery of 5.16 from 5.15 is made
easy by inference rules. Whenever the semantic analyses of a sentence like 5.15
is presented to a system, rules associated with the type of event/state node
involved can produce inferable information. This process allows for the human
process of the deduction of specific information about participants in an event
30
or state of affairs from knowledge-of the type of event or state of affairs. This
is actually what is happening with SR&apos;s. From our knowledge of sleeping, we know
that someone is where he is sleeping. From our knowledge of &amp;quot;working for&amp;quot;, we
know that Bill but not necessarily John is at the store in the followidt:
5.17 Bill is working for John at the store.
From our knowledge of contact cases such as in 5.18, we know that the location of
the intersections of the objects is learnable:
5.18 The ball hit Marr on the ear.
In semantic nets, these facts can be shown by inference rules associated with the
appropriate concepts. In Figure 5.4, the &amp;quot;subnet,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;subnet2&amp;quot; form described
in Section III is used to allow for the sleeping case. Other rules will, of
course, be needed for other concepts.* The predication of place objects, which
are the locations of events and states of affairs, therefore stands as the core
of our analysis. How it directly applies to represent certain SR&apos;s has been
shown in this section. In the next, more indirect analyses are considered.
FIGURE 5.4 The encoding of the rule &amp;quot;If you know where something
is sleeping, then you know where it is&amp;quot;.
*A potential critic may argue that the extra processing involved with inference
rules should be avoided if at all possible. However, no other analysis of
SR successfully avoids its use (Sondheimer, 1975).

VI. Non-Movement Locative Object Usages
The analysis of locative object usages is not as simple as that of other
forms. Looking back to Section &amp;quot;, most of the problems with earlier studies
arise from this class. The solution to these problems is found in an elaboration
on the basic form of our event/state analysis. This elaboration proceeds in two
directions. First, the semantic structure of the sentences containing the
troublesome SR&apos;s is seen to be more complex than otherwise thought. Second, the
nature of the SR is seen as more complex. The first case is best seen with non-
movement and the second with movement SR&apos;s. This section covers the non-movement
type of locative object. Section VII covers the movement type.
We can review the problems with the use of event and state location in the
non-movement cases, briefly. There is a need to differentiate referents uhich
can be seen in the following:
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.517271">
6.1 John held the ice bag to his head in the car.
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999972833333333">
The ice bag is to John&apos;s head, but both the ice bag and John are in the car. The
first SR involves a locative object, the second an adjunct. With a simple
approach to event/state location, they would not be differentiated. There is a
similar problem in some adjunct references to the location of only part of an
event or state of affairs. For instance, in 6.2, only the boy is placed which the
hawk is definitely physically present:
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.961056">
6.2 In an open field, a boy watched a hawk.
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9319306">
In the latter case, although not the former, the use of inference rules might be
suggested. However, a better answer can be found.
VI.1 Continuous Position and Perception Verbs
The semantic structure of simple sentences have often been analyzed as
involving multiple events and states of affairs, see for example, Schenk (1973)
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.459078">
32
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.99528075">
and Norman and Rumelhart (1975). If we can see prciblematic sentences in this
light, then perhaps we could assign the various SR&apos;s to different event/states.
Indeed, we can do both.
Instances of causative relations between events and states of affairs are
found in many problem sentences. Change-of-state events applying to separate
states of affairs are seen in others. Simple instances of embedded events and
states of affairs are seen in yet others. &amp;quot;Hold&amp;quot; belongs to a class of verbs that
involve continuous position. Others in the class include &amp;quot;adhere&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;cling&amp;quot;, and
&amp;quot;keep&amp;quot;. With locative objects, these can all be seen as causations. Each has an
action which causes some entity to remain somewhere. In our example 6.1, John&apos;s
holding-type action causes the ice bag to remain somewhere. Realizing this
allows us to analyze the SR&apos;s as locating events and states. The overall SR, &amp;quot;in
the car&amp;quot;, can be seen, as adjuncts were explained in the last section, as
locating the highest event/state within the causation. The &amp;quot;to his head&amp;quot; can be
seen as locating the resurtant state. This is shown in Figure 6.1. The TO in the
diagram represents a static sense of &amp;quot;to&amp;quot;.

<bodyText confidence="0.998930333333333">
&amp;quot;Watch&amp;quot; belongs to a class of verbs that includes &amp;quot;hear&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;see&amp;quot;, and
&amp;quot;taste&amp;quot;. These can all be seen as involving the perception of another event or
state of affairs.* In our example 6.2, it is the being somewhere, the existing,
of a hawk that is watched. How this allows for the SR to be associated with the
correct event/state is evident from Figure 6.2. This analysis may seem somewhat
forced here, but other exmaples show more overt event or state forms:
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.935290666666667">

<bodyText confidence="0.9417695">
*These verbs occasionally appear without an object:

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.403492">
34
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.881773857142857">
Inference rules play an important part in these analyses. For example, the
positioning of John and the ice bag must be derivable from the structure of
Figure 6.1. An inference rule must associate the position of the HOLDING-ACTION
with their positions. Another rule must relate a place object for the HOLDING-
ACTION as inside that of the CAUSING. Conversely, there should be no inference
rule applying to the structure of Figure 6.2 to show the place object of the
BEING-AT as being contained in that of the Watching.

The above sentences involve attachment, containment, posture, and creation. Each
has an element of coming-into-being that must be represented. The standard form
for these sentences shows the action of an agent causing the bringing about of a
state of affairs. The locative object is shown locating this state of affairs,
see Figure 6.3. The coming-into-being concept in this structure is labelled
COMING-ABOUT. The segment of the structure inside the dotted line is there to
show the analysis these verbs take in the second type of usage they allow:
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.997936">
6.10 It is nailed to the wall.
6.11 It is shut in the room.
6.12 It sits on the table.
6.13 It is drawn on a napkin.
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.919930393939394">
These, examples lack agents and any sort of causation. The forms within the
dotted line in Figure 6.3 Show exactly this structure.
The prepositional form, TO, in Figure 6.3, is to be understood in the static
sense just as with Figure 6.1. In fact, this is the case with all prepositional
forms used here. It is an important advantage of this analysis that it uses only
static senses in semantic structures. On the surface, it is often said that the
locative objects of the current set of verbs have dynamic senses. However, with
36
a separate inchoative event/state, this is unnecessary. This allows. thq repre-
sentation of presuppositions like &amp;quot;to&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;on to&amp;quot; either through &amp;quot;at&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;on&amp;quot; as
Gruber (1965) does, or through their own static iense as in example 6.10. This is
one in a series of reductions. It was shown in Section IV that some double
prepositional phrase structures involved &amp;quot;from&amp;quot; can be reduced to a simpler form.
It will be seen elsewhere that other simplications can be made. That underlying
senses of the prepositions are being used explains why our prepositional concepts
have been capitalized.
Another class of verbs., shows contact. They take the two types of analyses
just discussed. They also show a coming-into-being sense when no agent is
present but a state is achieved. All three cases are shown in the following:
6.14 I touched her on her face with my hand.
6.15 The tree touches the window near the top.
6.16 The ball touched my leg near the knee.
The semantic structures for each of these can contain an event/state showing
contact between the two objects to which the SR&apos;s can be applied.
Another class of verbs which show change of state have all three types of
structures with locative object usages:
6.17 I broke it on the rim.
6.18 The cup broke on the rim.
6.19 The cup is broken on the rim.
6.17 is causative/coming-into-being, 6.19 is coming-into-being, and 6.19 is
static only. The static form in each can again take the SR. In noncausative
examples with these change of state verbs, SR&apos;s generally appear to act as
locative objects, as a test from Section IV shows:
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.5187805">
6.20 The cup broke on my knee.
6.21 *On my knee, the cup broke.
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.879056">
The noncausative examples includes SR&apos;s which reference objeots not inherently
possessed by the changed object, such as 6.20, but which place the entire event.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.417427">
37
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.966413571428571">
In these cases, the SR&apos;s should be treated similarly to adjuncts and shown
applying to the COMING-ABOUT event/state.
Some verbs which take locative objects are like perception verbs in not
requiring causative analyses to explain locative object usages. These Include
discovery and thought verbs, suchas&amp;quot;spot&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;thought&amp;quot;. They can be shown with
embedded event/states. With locative object readings, 6.22 and 6.23 involve only
locating of the direct objects:
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.370407">
6.22 I spotted her behind the dresser.
6.23 I thought of Mary at the seashore.
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.937216">
These entities can be shown in an event/state claiming they existed in a certain
time and space with the SR predicating that event/state. This treatment would
parallel the structure of overt examples of embedded events as in the following:
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.538233">
6.24 I spotted you stealing some bananas.
6.25 I thought of you dancing.
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992089">
Finally, as Lyons (1968) notes, some verbs, which we treat here as having
locative objects, seem to relate to SR&apos;s in the same way as the compleMent
usages:
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.9710255">
6.26 It occurred in Chicago.
6.27 It remained in New Orleans.
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9264063">
These can be analyzed with one event/state showing both adjunct and locative
objects identifying the same entity.
So we have seen that the complexity associated with many SR&apos;s comes from
their semantic environment, not themselves. With the exception of a class of
verbs covered in the next section this covers the range of verbs that take non-
movement locative objects. Also covered but only indirectly are a few senses
left from the last chapter. We can now see how qualifiers of verbal nouns that
are acting as non-movement locative objects can be analyzed. We can also see
that resultive senses of the copula can be shown with a COMING-ABOUT, see Figure
6.4.

<bodyText confidence="0.9973642">
Problems with motion arise in every analysis of SR considered in Section II.
In this section, what is, as far as we know, an entirely unique approach to the
semantics of motion is presented. Our analysis&apos; centers on movement locative
objects. As has been mentioned, this involves complex modification of the
location of motional events. The section first presents a brief discussion of
the structure of movement sentences, then motivates our view of motion predica-
tion, and finally presents the details of the representation.
VII.1 The Structure of Movemement Sentences
The verbs that take movement locative objects are numerous, see Miller
(1972). They include &amp;quot;come&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;go&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;bring&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;take&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;climb&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;drive&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;bit&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;punt&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;set&amp;quot;, etc. The structure of the sentences with movement locative
objects resembles that of sentences with non-mov4ment locative objects in being
complex. Nearly all examples show causative structure with an actioh in one
event/state causing motion in another (Fillmore, 1971). The appropriate analyses
approximately pairs the following:
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99117525">
7.1 John threw the ball through the door.
7.2 John&apos;s throwing caused the ball to go through the door.
7.3 Mary walked out of the house.
7.4 Mary&apos;s walking caused her to go out of the house.
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.910406571428571">
The only sentences which take simple, causative-like analyses are those with &amp;quot;go&amp;quot;
and &amp;quot;come&amp;quot;.
An important aspect of the analysis of movement SR&apos;s is the concept to be
used in the motional event/state. The semantic equivalents of &amp;quot;go&amp;quot;
will not do. These verbs have special deictic conditions on them
1966):
Go there.

Only &amp;quot;take&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;bring&amp;quot; show the same pattern. For this reason, an abstract
concept of pure motion, called GOING, will be used in our analysis. Figure 7.1
shows the sentential structure into which most movement SR&apos;s Will tit. The
structures for &amp;quot;take&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;bring&amp;quot; will have Going and Coming, respectively, in
place of the abstract form. For &amp;quot;go&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;come&amp;quot; themselves, the semantic
structures will match the motional event/state shown with the other verbs with
the exception of the type of event/state. The place objects of all the motional
events can be considered the same, as can the way SR&apos;s apply to the different
types of motion. We can also think of motional qualifiers as analyzable with the
same structure. Because of this, the structure of movement predication will be
considered in general and isolated from other forms.

VII.2 Thinking About Motion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.982655238095238">
As was pointed out in Section II, one reason that motional SR&apos;s are
difficult is the multiple predications of different types which must be orderable
in time. These problems can be overcome with appropriate consideration of the
motion and the place objects of motional events.
The insight for a better analysis comes from considering answers to
questions of where motion occurs. Consider the answer to where the first
Marathon was run. It is probably something like &amp;quot;in Greece&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;from Marathon to
Athens&amp;quot;. These tend to place the entirety of motion. It is unlikely to be just
&amp;quot;from Marathon&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;to Athens&amp;quot;. These just place, part of the motion,. People tend
to locate motion as if it were a single thing, &amp;quot;a motion&amp;quot; so to speak. This is
how we propose to think of the place object of motibnal events.
Place objects of motional events can be thought of as showing that motion,
essentially showing a trace of the path of motion. This trace would be similar to
the trace a piece of chalk leaves as it crosses a blackboard. But it should be
the marks that would be made by the entire chalk if space was a three—dimensional
blackboard and the entire chalk could write. This idea is displayed pictorially
in Figure 7.2 with another example where something approaching an overexposed
photograph of a rolling ball shows a solid cylinder tracing a ball&apos;s movement.
It is this type of cylinder that motional place objects represent.
This trace idea has one great merit. It allows direct analysis of the most
troublesome class of movements SR&apos;s:
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.83563075">
7.9 He walked through the puddle.
7.10 He walked across the puddle.
7.11 Be walked around the puddle.
7.12 He walked over the. puddle.
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.902325">
As was pointed out in Section II, the above require a representation that
considers every instance of movement. The trace idea does this in such a

<figureCaption confidence="0.553399">
FIGURE 7.2 A ball rolling across a sidewalk to a porch.

<bodyText confidence="0.988258">
way that the SR&apos;s can be shown applying to the trace directly. Further, it does
it in a way that allows the basic static use of the preposition to be used in the
representation:
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.57374">
7.13 The bridges across the Mississippi are closed.
</subsubsectionHeader>
<tableCaption confidence="0.927331454545455">
This was pointed out in Section IV to be the same sense that applied in the
&amp;quot;across-from&amp;quot; form:
7.14 The man stopped across the street from here.
Hence three usages collapse into one with this representation.
This concept can be extended to allow for differentiating &amp;quot;up&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;down&amp;quot; by
considering the solid traces to have an inherent ordering based on the direction
of motion:
7.16 He walked up the hill.
7.17 He walked down the hill.
Hence, the traces in 7.16 and 7.17 could be exactly the same except for the
ordering and the preposition could be sensitive to this. This ordering
</tableCaption>
<page confidence="0.716594">
43

<figureCaption confidence="0.39321325">
sensitivity shows up with other uses of the prepositions and other prepositions:
7.18 The carotid arteries extend up the neck to the head.
7.19 A woman stood at the front of the line while a man
stood at the rear.
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.958559105263158">
Hence its use is not arbitrary.
The trace or path idea does not provide an immediate explanation for other
movement Sit&apos;s, those that reference instantaneous change:
7.20 He hit the ball into the corner.
7.21 He walked out of the house.
With the above we can not say that the overall path of motion was either &amp;quot;into&amp;quot;
the house or &amp;quot;out of&amp;quot; the house in the static sense of these prepositions
However, there is a way we could use the static sense. If we could refer to
positions achieved by the moving object as it followed the path, we could say
that there were positions where the object first got to be &amp;quot;into the corner&amp;quot; and
&amp;quot;out of the house&amp;quot;. This would be like allowing reference to the position of the
individual balls displayed in Figure 7.2. We can conclude that we ought to be
able to reference parts of place objects.
Being able to reference parts of motion actually leads to a solution of the
problem of temporal ordering inherent in multiple SR, such as &amp;quot;... across the
yard up the stairs ...&amp;quot;. If these durational forms are also thought of as
modifying discrete, bounded parts of the kind of place objects that are being
discussed, then they too can be compared. For the phrase just mentioned, a part
of the motional object that was across the yard could be compared to a part that
was up the stairs as being less further along it. The same could be done to
compare the parts involved with instantaneous reference.
To summarize, the idea is to think of movement as a trace of the event over
time, which has an inherent orientation and which cab be predicated in part. We
can now almost present our representation. We will first present a slightly
incomplete proposal and then revise it.
44
VII.3 Semantic Structures for Motion
Tentatively, we propose two different functions to produce parts from
complete place objects. These are called SEGMENT and UNIT. They will be used
with durations&apos; and instantaneous references, respectively. The durations&apos;
function can be taken as picking off bounded parts of a place object. The
instantaneous function can be assumed to pick off part of the trace beginning at
the earliest point, and going up to the point of change. Both functions will have
the place object they accept identified by an S link and the produced space
identified by a VALUE link. To distinguish the two outputs, the SEGMENTized
place object will have a colon inserted, and the UNITized one a period. The
segments will be shown as ordered through &amp;quot;numeric&amp;quot; comparisons. Figure 7.3
therefore gives a tentative analysis for the sentence &amp;quot;The cat came across the
yard up the stairs into the house&amp;quot;. One SEGMENT function picks out the motion
across the yard while another picks out motion up the stairs. A UNIT function
picks out motion into the house. The segments are all ordered by less-than-or-
equal links.
The temporal ordering of the partial traces is the one tentative part of the
analysis. To have it be sensible, some scale of comparison must exist. The
appropriate choice appears to be the temporal scale. When the locations were
achieved is, of course, what is being ordered. There must also be conventions on
application of the comparison. This is because there must be a way to force the
comparison on only the appropriate end points of segments. We might develop a
way of making these conventions inherent, but I propose to make them explicit.
FIGURE 7.3 A tentative analysis of &amp;quot;The cat came across the
yard up the stairs into the house.&amp;quot;
Our final proposal for the structure of motional SR&apos;s is to include time
parameters with the functions. In this way, both the end points of the segments
and the temporal scale can be identified. For the SEGMENT function, two links,
Ti and T2, will identify the times that initial and final points were occupied.
For the UNIT function, one link, T, will identify the time the final position was
achieved. These structures are shown in Figure 7.4 and 7.5.

<bodyText confidence="0.941578625">
Now, in order to allow for multiple motional locative objects, two time
instances can be related with a temporal relation, LE, for less than or equal.
This is done in Figure 7.6.
An interesting aspect of the semantic structure of Figure 7.6 is the static
representation of &amp;quot;from&amp;quot;. It is to be understood as showing that up to some point
47
in the journey the moving object was not away from the house, but that it
eventually got to be away from it. &amp;quot;Out of&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;off of&amp;quot; are analyzed similarly.

VII.4 Static Spatial References Applying to Motional Events
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.931720043478261">
Besides the Aurational and instantaneous predications of motion, there can
be overall predications of moving objects. These come in two forms. Adjuncts in
movement sentences place the entirety of motion:
7.22 In Chicago, he walked around the downtown.
7.23 John came to Chicago in a plane.
One class of verbs, which allows both movement and non-movement locative objects,
allows the moving object to be statically placed during movement:
7.24 He carried the dog onto the bus in a box.
7.25 He brought John to Chicago in a plane.
This class is the portability verbs left over from the last section. These verbs
take causative analyses with a motional event/state as the caused event. In both
of these kind of examples, the motional event must have its motional properties
represented at the same time as its static properties. Instantaneous and
dutational SR&apos;s must be shown predicating special place objects which are parts
of whole place objects. Therefore, we must show the overall predication applying
to different forms. These must be the complete place objects representing the
entirety of motion. This is consistant with our other anlayses, as will shortly
be seen in more detail. It,will also simplify the inference rules that bring down
overall spatial predications from higher levels to the motional place objects.
This analysis is seen in Figure 7.7 which essentially summarizes this section.
We have introduced two new functions and types of place objects. These have
allowed for movement locative objects. We must, however, realize that there are
other uses-for this analysis. We will see why in the next section.

VIII. Extending the Motional Analysis to Other Spatial References
The last section may have given the reader the impression that the analyses
for motiopal SR&apos;s are really different from those given other SR&apos;s. Motional
place objects have been set out as a history of movement in space and time.
Nonmotional place objects are left as &amp;quot;just&amp;quot; the location of certain events and
states of affairs. In this section, we argue that this should definitely not be
assumed. The place object of nonmotional SR&apos;s must be seen to have the sane
space-time structure as motional place objects. These are several arguments for
this point.
Relative motion has been considered only for sentences with movement verbs,
but relative motion and references to motion are common as adjuncts of &amp;quot;non-
motional&amp;quot; sentences:
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.7254435">
8.1 John held the ice bag to his head in the moving car.
8.2 Jane sat on her purse from New York to Los Angeles.
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992043821428571">
In each of the above examples two objects are statically related, i.e., John and
the ice bag, and Jane and her purse, respectively. However, all are moving. One
pair moves but remains static with respect to a car. The other pair is moving and
changing with respect to twocities. Hence, motion must somehow be allowed for
in these &amp;quot;nonmotional&amp;quot; analyses. Further, change of relative position must be
allowed for in at least one. No hint was given of how this last problem is to be
solved in any of our discussions of nonmotional SR&apos;s.
Even when motion is not overt, time may have to be considered with SR&apos;s:
8.3 He died in his car.
As we have seen in the analyses of sentences like 8.3, the car is to be related to
the event of the dying. Consider the fact that the car is moveable. If we were
to check to see if this were true, we must have either a history of the car&apos;s
location or have the ability to find its location at the time of death. In oher
words, time must be available for even instantaneous events.
FIGURE 8.1 &amp;quot;She sat on her purEle from New York to Los Angeles.&amp;quot;.
The way to extend our analysis to cover these facts is to recognize the
connection between motional and nonmotional place objects. Motional events
involve the location over time of moving objects. Nonmotional events and states
of affairs do not necessarily involve moving objects, but they can involve
location over time. This location is the space of spaces occupied by an event or
state of affairs during its holding. To analyze the cases of relative motion and
motion with nonmotional events and states of affairs, these locations-over-time
must be taken as the locations if the events and states of affairs. Note that
this does not change any of the analyses presented earlier, only the way they are
understood. With the same tyte of place object in all SR&apos;s the problematic
examples that began this section can be elegantly allowed for with the use of the
motional functions. This is shown for example 8.2 in Figure 8.1. So in
conclusion we propose an analysis that treats all SR&apos;s the setae.

<abstract confidence="0.980278342105263">SUMMARY This paper presents an analysis in a semantic net formalism of the semantic structure of English sentences containing references to spatial. location. Spatial reference, hereafter SR, provides either static location or motional information John is at home, Fred ran across the street to the store. .The task for the semantic analysis of sentences with SR&apos;s is tohmake clear what is being positioned. This has been difficult to do. Previous proposals have left unanalyzed many phenomena including important motional references. This paper&apos;-s main conclusion is that a much improved analysis can be obtaindd by representing the SR&apos;s as positioning abstract events and states of affairs. The analysis in semantic nets has the location of an event or state of affairs represented as a node which is linked to the node showing the event or by arcs indicating its status as the spatial attribute. SR&apos;s are as naming these locational entities, which we call object.These SR&apos;s involve examples with &amp;quot;where&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;here&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;there&amp;quot; However, most SR&apos;s are represented as relating place objects to the position of objects in the manner of prepositiotal phrases. This primacy ot prepositions is argued for in the paper. Motional references are allowed for by functions represented in the nets which produce parts of place objects which are then positioned by prepositional farms. The necessary ordering that&apos; comes with motional references is allowed for by associating temporal elements with the functions. While the positioned elements are simple, the overall semantic structure of the sentences containing SR&apos;s is often complicated by the involvement of more than one event or state of affairs. The paper includes a survey of the sentential semantic structures necessary to deal with SR&apos;s. A similar complexity necessary to deal with the information on the location of objects which is gained from sentences with SR&apos;s. The paper suggesta the use of inference rules to allow for this. The most surprising of the paper&apos;s conclusions is that a strong tie exists between references to space and temporal information. In fact, the locations of all events and states of affairs placed by SR&apos;s are argued to be locations in both space and time. The effect of this conclusion is most clearly seen in formalized definition of the primitives of the semantic structures, which is also presented in semantic nets. There, as one possible interpretation of the place object, it is shown as a set of pairs of volumes in space and points in time. 2</abstract>
