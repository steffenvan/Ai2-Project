We argue in this article that many common adverbial phrases generally taken to signal a discourse
relation between syntactically connected units within discourse structure instead work anaphor-
ically to contribute relational meaning, with only indirect dependence on discourse structure.
This allows a simpler discourse structure to provide scaffolding for compositional semantics and
reveals multiple ways in which the relational meaning conveyed by adverbial connectives can
interact with that associated with discourse structure. We conclude by sketching out a lexicalized
grammarfor discourse that facilitates discourse interpretation as a product of compositional rules,
anaphor resolution, and inference.

1. Introduction

It is a truism that a text means more than the sum of its component sentences. One
source of additional meaning are relations taken to hold between adjacent sentences
“syntactically” connected within a larger discourse structure. It has been very difficult,
however, to say what discourse relations there are, either theoretically (Mann and
Thompson 1988; Kehler 2002; Asher and Lascarides 2003) or empirically (Knott 1996).
Knott’s empirical attempt to identify and characterize cue phrases as evidence
for discourse relations illustrates some of the difficulties. Knott used the following
theory-neutral test to identify cue phrases: For a potential cue phrase 0 in naturally
occurring text, consider in isolation the clause in which it appears. If the clause ap-
pears incomplete without an adjacent left context, whereas it appears complete if 0 is
removed, then 0 is a cue phrase. Knott’s test produced a nonexhaustive list of about
two hundred different phrases from 226 pages of text. He then attempted to charac-
terize the discourse relation(s) conveyed by each phrase by identifying when (always,
sometimes, never) one phrase could substitute for another in a way that preserved
meaning. He showed how these substitution patterns could be a consequence of a set
of semantic features and their values. Roughly speaking, one cue phrase could always
substitute for another if it had the same set of features and values, sometimes do so if
it was less specific than the other in terms of its feature values, and never do so if their
values conflicted for one or more features.

By assuming that cue phrases contribute meaning in a uniform way, Knott was
led to a set of surprisingly complex directed acyclic graphs relating cue phrases in
terms of features and their values, each graph loosely corresponding to some family of
discourse relations. But what if the relational meaning conveyed by cue phrases could
in fact interact with discourse meaning in multiple ways? Then Knott’s substitution
patterns among cue phrases may have reflected these complex interactions, as well as
the meanings of individual cue phrases themselves.
This article argues that cue phrases do depend on another mechanism for convey-
ing extrasentential meaning—specifically, anaphora. One early hint that adverbial cue
phrases (called here discourse connectives) might be anaphoric can be found in an
ACL workshop paper in which Janyce Wiebe (1993) used the following example to
question the adequacy of tree structures for discourse:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.97020625">
(1) a. The car was finally coming toward him.
b. He [Chee] finished his diagnostic tests,
c. feeling relief.
d. But then the car started to turn right.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99823375">
The problem Wiebe noted was that the discourse connectives but and then appear to
link clause (1d) to two different things: then to clause (1b) in a sequence relation (i.e.,
the car’s starting to turn right being the next relevant event after Chee’s finishing his
tests) and but to a grouping of clauses (1a) and (1c) (i.e., reporting a contrast between,
on the one hand, Chee’s attitude toward the car coming toward him and his feeling
of relief and, on the other hand, his seeing the car turning right). (Wiebe doesn’t give
a name to the relation she posits between (1d) and the grouping of (1a) and (1c), but
it appears to be some form of contrast.)
If these relations are taken to be the basis for discourse structure, some possible
discourse structures for this example are given in Figure 1. Such structures might seem
advantageous in allowing the semantics of the example to be computed directly by
compositional rules and defeasible inference. However, both structures are directed
acyclic graphs (DAGs), with acyclicity the only constraint on what nodes can be con-
nected. Viewed syntactically, arbitrary DAGs are completely unconstrained systems.
They substantially complicate interpretive rules for discourse, in order for those rules
to account for the relative scope of unrelated operators and the contribution of syn-
tactic nodes with arbitrarily many parents.1
We are not committed to trees as the limiting case of discourse structure. For
example, we agree, by and large, with the analysis that Bateman (1999) gives of
(2) (vi) The first to do that were the German jewellers, (vii) in particular Klaus
Burie. (viii) And Morris followed very quickly after, (ix) using a lacquetry
technique to make the brooch, (x) and using acrylics, (xi) and exploring
the use of colour, (xii) and colour is another thing that was new at that
time.

1 A reviewer has suggested an alternative analysis of (1) in which clause (1a) is elaborated by clause
(1b), which is in turn elaborated by (1c), and clause (1d) stands in both a sequence relation and a
contrast relation to the segment as a whole. Although this might address Wiebe’s problem, the result is
still a DAG, and such a fix will not address the additional examples we present in section 2, in which a
purely structural account still requires DAGs with crossing arcs.

in which clause (ix) stands in a manner relation with clause (viii), which in turn stands
in a succession (i.e., sequence) relation with clause (vi). This is illustrated in Figure 2,
which shows a DAG (rather than a tree), but without crossing dependencies.
So it is the cost of moving to arbitrary DAGs for discourse structure that we feel is
too great to be taken lightly. This is what has led us to look for another explanation for
these and other examples of apparent complex and crossing dependencies in discourse.
The position we argue for in this article, is that whereas adjacency and explicit
conjunction (coordinating conjunctions such as and, or, so, and but; subordinating con-
junctions such as although, whereas, and when) imply discourse relations between (the
interpretation of) adjacent or conjoined discourse units, discourse adverbials such as
then, otherwise, nevertheless, and instead are anaphors, signaling a relation between the
interpretation of their matrix clause and an entity in or derived from the discourse
context. This position has four advantages:

1. Understanding discourse adverbials as anaphors recognizes their
behavioral similarity to the pronouns and definite noun phrases (NPs)
that are the bread and butter of previous work on anaphora. This is
discussed in section 2.
2. By understanding and exploring the full range of phenomena for which
an anaphoric account is appropriate, we can better characterize anaphors
and devise more accurate algorithms for resolving them. This is explored
in section 3.
3. Any theory of discourse must still provide an account of how a sequence
of adjacent discourse units (clauses, sentences, and the larger units that
they can comprise) means more than just the sum of its component

units. This is a goal that researchers have been pursuing for some time,
using both compositional rules and defeasible inference to determine
these additional aspects of meaning (Asher and Lascarides 1999; Gardent
1997; Hobbs et al. 1993; Kehler 2002; Polanyi and van den Berg 1996;
Scha and Polanyi 1988; Schilder 1997a, 1997b; van den Berg 1996) If that
portion of discourse semantics that can be handled by mechanisms
already needed for resolving other forms of anaphora and deixis is
factored out, there is less need to stretch and possibly distort
compositional rules and defeasible inference to handle everything.2
Moreover, recognizing the possibility of two separate relations (one
derived anaphorically and one associated with adjacency and/or a
structural connective) admits additional richness to discourse semantics.
Both points are discussed further in section 4.
4. Understanding discourse adverbials as anaphors allows us to see more
clearly how a lexicalized approach to the computation of clausal syntax
and semantics extends naturally to the computation of discourse syntax
and semantics, providing a single syntactic and semantic matrix with
which to associate speaker intentions and other aspects of pragmatics
(section 5.)
The account we provide here is meant to be compatible with current approaches
to discourse semantics such as DRT (Kamp and Reyle 1993; van Eijck and Kamp
1997), dynamic semantics (Stokhof and Groenendijk 1999), and even SDRT (Asher
1993; Asher and Lascarides 2003), understood as a representational scheme rather
than an interpretive mechanism. It is also meant to be compatible with more detailed
analyses of the meaning and use of individual discourse adverbials, such as Jayes
and Rossari (1998a, 1998b) and Traugott, (1995, 1997). It provides what we believe to
be a more coherent account of how discourse meaning is computed, rather than an
alternative account of what that meaning is or what speaker intentions it is being used
to achieve.

2.1 Discourse Adverbials Do Not Behave like Structural Connectives

<bodyText confidence="0.999817833333333">
We take the building blocks of the most basic level of discourse structure to be explicit
structural connectives between adjacent discourse units (i.e., coordinating and subor-
dinating conjunctions and “paired” conjunctions such as not only ... but also, and on the
one hand ... on the other (hand) and inferred relations between adjacent discourse units

the inference. Consider the following example:

tion. Our goal in this section is to convince the reader that many discourse adverbials,
including then, also, otherwise, nevertheless, and instead, do not behave in this way.
Structural connectives and discourse adverbials do have one thing in common:
Like verbs, they can both be seen as heading a predicate-argument construction; unlike
verbs, their arguments are independent clauses. For example, both the subordinate
conjunction after and the adverbial then (in its temporal sense) can be seen as binary
predicates (e.g., sequence) whose arguments are clausally derived events, with the
earlier event in first position and the succeeding event in second.
But that is the only thing that discourse adverbials and structural connectives have
in common. As we have pointed out in earlier papers (Webber, Knott, and Joshi 2001;
Webber et al., 1999a, 1999b), structural connectives have two relevant properties: (1)
they admit stretching of predicate-argument dependencies; and (2) they do not admit
crossing of those dependencies. This is most obvious in the case of preposed subor-
dinate conjunctions (example (4)) or “paired” coordinate conjunctions (example (5)).
With such connectives, the initial predicate signals that its two arguments will follow.

<listItem confidence="0.97528">
(4) Although John is generous, he is hard to find.
(5) On the one hand, Fred likes beans. On the other hand, he’s allergic to them.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.748161">
Like verbs, structural connectives allow the distance between the predicate and its
arguments to be “stretched” over embedded material, without loss of the dependency
between them. For the verb like and an object argument apples, such stretching without
loss of dependency is illustrated in example (6b).

That this also happens with structural connectives and their arguments is illustrated
in example (7) (in which the first clause of example (4) is elaborated by another pre-
posed subordinate-main clause construction embedded within it) and in example (8)
(in which the first conjunct of example (5) is elaborated by another paired-conjunction
construction embedded within it). Possible discourse structures for these examples are
given in Figure 3.

Even if the reader finds no problem with these crossed versions, they clearly do not
mean the same thing as their uncrossed counterparts: In (10), but now appears to link
(10d) with (10c), conveying that despite being allergic to beans, Fred eats them for
breakfast and snacks. And although this might be inferred from (8), it is certainly not
conveyed directly. As a consequence, we stipulate that structural connectives do not
admit crossing of their predicate-argument dependencies.3
That is not all. Since we take the basic level of discourse structure to be a conse-
quence of (1) relations associated with explicit structural connectives and (2) relations
3 A reviewer has asked how much stretching is possible in discourse without losing its thread or having
to rephrase later material in light of the intervening material. One could ask a similar question about
the apparently unbounded dependencies of sentence-level syntax, which inattentive speakers are prone
to lose track of and “fracture.” Neither question seems answerable on theoretical grounds alone, with
both demanding substantial amounts of empirical data from both written and spoken discourse. The
point we are trying to make is simply that there is a difference in discourse between any amount of
stretching and even the smallest amount of crossing.

whose defeasible inference is triggered by adjacency, we stipulate that discourse struc-
ture itself does not admit crossing structural dependencies. (In this sense, discourse structure
may be truly simpler than sentence structure. To verify this, one might examine the
discourse structure of languages such as Dutch that allow crossing dependencies in
sentence-level syntax. Initial cursory examination does not give any evidence of cross-
ing dependencies in Dutch discourse.)
If we now consider the corresponding properties of discourse adverbials, we see
that they do admit crossing of predicate-argument dependencies, as shown in exam-

Consider first the discourse adverbial then in clause (11d). For it to get its first
argument from (11b) (i.e., the event that the discovery in (d) is “after”), it must cross

This suggests that in examples (11)–(13), the relationship between the discourse ad-

2.2 Discourse Adverbials Do Behave like Anaphors

<bodyText confidence="0.988501333333333">
There is additional evidence to suggest that otherwise, then, and other discourse adver-
bials are anaphors. First, anaphors in the form of definite and demonstrative NPs can
take implicit material as their referents. For example, in

both NPs refer to the structure which is the implicit result of the block stacking.
(Further discussion of such examples can be found in Isard [1975]; Dale [1992]; and
Webber and Baldwin [1992].) The same is true of discourse adverbials. In

<listItem confidence="0.921067">
(17) Do you want an apple? Otherwise you can have a pear.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.975727962962963">
the situation in which you can have a pear is one in which you don’t want an apple—
that is, one in which your answer to the question is “no.” But this answer isn’t there
structurally: It is only inferred. Although it appears natural to resolve an anaphor to an
inferred entity, it would be much more difficult to establish such links through purely
structural connections: To do so would require complex transformations that introduce
invisible elements into discourse syntax with no deeper motivation. For example, in
(17), we would need a rule that takes a discourse unit consisting solely of a yes/no
question P? and replaces it with a complex segment consisting of P? and the clause
it is possible that P, with the two related by something like elaboration. Then and only
then could we account for the interpretation of the subsequent otherwise structurally,
by a syntactic link to the covert material (i.e., to the possibility that P holds, which
otherwise introduces an alterative to).
Second, discourse adverbials have a wider range of options with respect to their
initial argument than do structural connectives (i.e., coordinating and subordinating
conjunctions). The latter are constrained to linking a discourse unit on the right frontier
of the evolving discourse (i.e., the clause, sentence and larger discourse units to its
immediate left). Discourse adverbials are not so constrained. To see this, consider the
following example:
4 We are aware that crossing examples such as (11)—(13) are rare in naturally occurring discourse. We
believe that this is because they are only possible when, as here, strong constraints from the discourse
adverbial and from context prevent the adverbial from relating to the closest (leftmost) eventuality or
an eventuality coerced from that one. But rarity doesn’t necessarily mean ill-formedness or marginality,
as readers can see for themselves if they use Google to search the Web for strings such as because then, if
instead, and whereas otherwise, and consider (1) whether the hundreds, even thousands, of texts in which
these strings occur are ill-formed, and (2) what then, instead, and otherwise are relating in these texts.
One must look at rare events if one is studying complex linguistic phenomena in detail. Thus it is not
the case that only common things in language are real or worth further study.

This can be paraphrased using the conjunction or:
If the light is red, stop, or you’ll get a ticket.
Here or links its right argument to a unit on the right frontier of the evolving discourse—
in this case, the clause stop on its immediate left. Now consider the related example
(19) If the light is red, stop. Otherwise go straight on.
(If the light is not red, go straight on.)
This cannot be paraphrased with or, as in
(20) If the light is red, stop, or go straight on.
even though both stop and If the light is red, stop are on the right frontier of the evolving
discourse structure. This is because otherwise is accessing something else, so that (20)
means something quite different from either (18) or (19). What otherwise is accessing,
which or cannot, is the interpretation of the condition alone.5 Thus discourse adver-
bials, like other anaphors, have access to material that is not available to structural
connectives.
Finally, discourse adverbials, like other anaphors, may require semantic represen-
tations in which their arguments are bound variables ranging over discourse entities.
That is, whereas it might be possible to represent Although P, Q using a binary modal
operator

In donkey sentences, anaphors are interpreted as covarying with their antecedents:
The it that is being fed in (23) varies with the farmer who feeds it. These anaphors,
however, appear in a structural and interpretive environment in which a direct syn-
tactic relationship between anaphor and antecedent is normally impossible, so they
cannot be a reflex of true binding in the syntax-semantics interface. Rather, donkey
sentences show that discourse semantics has to provide variables to translate pronouns,

the pronouns appear “free” by syntactic criteria.

<bodyText confidence="0.999927">
The examples in (24) involve binding in the interpretation of discourse adverbials.
In (24a), the temporal use of then locates each hiring event after the corresponding
software development. Likewise in (24b), the adversative use of nevertheless signals
each developer’s unexpected failure to turn the corresponding profit. And in (24c),
otherwise envisions each person’s begging if that person weren’t selling ”The Big Issue”.
Such bound interpretations require variables in the semantic representations and
alternative values for them in some model—hence the representation given in (22).
Indeed, it is clear that the binding here has to be the discourse kind, not the syntac-
tic kind, for the same reason as in (23), although we cannot imagine anyone arguing
otherwise, since discourse adverbials have always been treated as elements of dis-
course interpretation. So the variables must be the discourse variables usually used to
translate other kinds of discourse anaphors.6
These arguments have been directed at the behavioral similarity between discourse
adverbials and what we normally take to be discourse anaphors. But this isn’t the only
reason to recognize discourse adverbials as anaphors: In the next section, we suggest
a framework for anaphora that is broad enough to include discourse adverbials as
well as definite and demonstrative pronouns and NPs, along with other discourse
phenomena that have been argued to be anaphoric, such as VP ellipsis (Hardt 1992,
1999; Kehler 2002), tense (Partee 1984; Webber 1988) and modality (Kibble 1995; Frank
and Kamp 1997; Stone and Hardt 1999).

context. (Under coreference we include split reference, in which a plural anaphor such
as the companies denotes all the separately mentioned companies in focus within the
discourse context.) Much has been written about the factors affecting what discourse
referents are taken to be in focus. For a recent review by Andrew Kehler, see chap-
ter 18 of Jurafsky and Martin (2000). For the effect of different types of quantifiers on
discourse referents and focus, see Kibble (1995).
Somewhat more complex than coreference is indirect anaphora (Hellman and
Fraurud 1996) (also called partial anaphora [Luperfoy 1992], textual ellipsis [Hahn,
Markert, and Strube 1996], associative anaphora [Cosse 1996] bridging anaphora
[Clark 1975; Clark and Marshall 1981; Not, Tovena, and Zancanaro 1999], and in-
ferrables [Prince 1992]), in which the anaphor (usually a definite NP) denotes a dis-
course referent associated with one (or more) discourse referents in the current discourse
context; for example,
(25) Myra darted to a phone and picked up the receiver.
Here the receiver denotes the receiver associated with (by virtue of being part of) the
already-mentioned phone Myra darted to.
Coreference and indirect anaphora can be uniformly modeled by saying that the
discourse referent eα denoted by an anaphoric expression α is either equal to or asso-
ciated with an existing discourse referent er, that is, eα=er or eα Eassoc(er). But coref-
erence and associative anaphora do not exhaust the space of constructs that derive
all or part of their sense from the discourse context and are thus anaphoric. Consider
“other NPs” (Bierner 2001a; Bierner and Webber 2000; Modjeska 2001, 2002), as in:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.640747">
(26) Sue grabbed one phone, as Tom darted to the other phone.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998762272727273">
Although “other NPs” are clearly anaphoric, should the referent of the other phone
(eα)—the phone other than the one Sue grabbed (er)—simply be considered a case of
eα E assoc(er)? Here are two reasons why they should not.
First, in all cases of associative anaphora discussed in the literature, possible as-
sociations have depended only on the antecedent er and not on the anaphor. For
example, only antecedents that have parts participate in whole-part associations (e.g.,
phone → receiver). Only antecedents with functional schemata participate in schema-
based associations (e.g., lock → key). In (26), the relationship between eα, the referent
of the other phone, and its antecedent, er, depends in part on the anaphor, and not just
on the antecedent—in particular, on the presence of the word other.
Second, we also have examples such as
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.717615">
(27) Sue lifted the receiver as Tom darted to the other phone.7
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999767">
in which the referent of the other phone (eα) is the phone other than the phone associated
with the receiver that Sue lifted. Together, these two points argue for a third possibility,
in which an anaphoric element can convey a specific function fα that is idiosyncratic
to the anaphor, which may be applied to either er or an associate of er. The result of
that application is eα. For want of a better name, we will call these lexically specified
anaphors.
Other lexically specified anaphors include noun phrases headed by other (exam-
ple (28)), NPs with such but no postmodifying as phrase (example (29)), comparative

3.2 Discourse Adverbials as Lexical Anaphors
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.981915052631579">
There is nothing in this generalized approach to discourse anaphora that requires that
the source of er be an NP, or that the anaphor be a pronoun or NP. For example, the
antecedent er of a singular demonstrative pronoun (in English, this or that) is often
an eventuality that derives from a clause, a sentence, or a larger unit in the recent
discourse (Asher 1993; Byron 2002; Eckert and Strube 2000; Webber 1991). We will
show that this is the case with discourse adverbials as well.
The extension we make to the general framework presented above in order to
include discourse adverbials as discourse anaphors is to allow more general functions
fα to be associated with lexically specified anaphors. In particular, for the discourse
adverbials considered in this article, the function associated with an adverbial maps its
anaphoric argument—an eventuality derived from the current discourse context—to
a function that applies to the interpretation of the adverbial’s matrix clause (itself an
eventuality). The result is a binary relation that holds between the two eventualities
and is added to the discourse context. For example, in
(32) John loves Barolo. So he ordered three cases of the ’97. But he had to
cancel the order because he then discovered he was broke.
then, roughly speaking, contributes the fact that its matrix clause event (John’s find-
ing he was broke) is after the anaphorically derived event of his ordering the wine.8
Similarly, in

<listItem confidence="0.747095">
(33) John didn’t have enough money to buy a mango. Instead, he bought a
guava.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.942718666666667">
instead contributes the fact that its matrix clause event (buying a guava) is an alternative
to the anaphorically derived event of buying a mango. The relation between the two
sentences is something like result, as in So instead, he bought a guava.
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.954214">
8 Words and phrases that function as discourse adverbials usually have other roles as well: For example,
otherwise also serves as an adjectival modifier, as in I was otherwise occupied with grading exams. This
overloading of closed-class lexico-syntactic items is not unusual in English, and any ambiguities that
arise must be handled as part of the normal ambiguity resolution process.

Note that our only concern here is with the compositional and anaphoric mech-
anisms by which adverbials contribute meaning. For detailed analysis of the lexical
semantics of adverbials (but no attention to mechanism), the reader is referred to Jayes
and Rossari (1998a, 1998b, Lagerwerf (1998), Traugott (1995, 1997), and others.
Formally, we represent the function that a discourse adverbial α contributes as a
A-expression involving a binary relation Rα that is idiosyncratic to α, one of whose
arguments (represented here by the variable EV) is resolved anaphorically:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.499445">
Ax . Rα(x, EV)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.88354">
Rα gets its other argument compositionally, when this A-expression is applied to α’s
matrix clause S interpreted as an eventuality u, that is,
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.550531">
[Ax . Rα(x,EV)]u ≡ Rα(u,EV)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.99986105">
The result of both function application and resolving EV to some eventuality e; derived
from the discourse context either directly or by association is the proposition Rα(u, e;),
one of whose arguments (e;) has been supplied by the discourse context and the other
(u) compositionally from syntax.
Note that this is a formal model, meant to have no implications for how pro-
cessing takes place. We have not tried at this stage to instantiate our view of how
discourse adverbials are resolved in the context of (simultaneous) sentence-level and
discourse-level processing. Our basic view is that resolution is initiated when the dis-
course adverbial (α) is encountered. As α’s matrix clause S is incrementally parsed and
interpreted, producing eventuality u, the resolution process polls the discourse context
and either finds an appropriate eventuality e; (or creates one by a bridging inference,
as illustrated in the next section) such that Rα(u, e;) makes sense with respect to the
discourse so far. As is the case with resolving a discourse deictic (Asher 1993; Byron
2002; Eckert and Strube 2000; Webber 1991) this resolution process would use syn-
tactic and semantic constraints that it accumulates as the incremental sentence-level
parser/interpreter processes S. As with discourse deixis, this is best seen as a con-
straint satisfaction problem that involves finding or deriving an eventuality from the
current discourse context that meets the constraints of the adverbial with respect to the
eventuality interpretation of the matrix clause. (Examples of this are given throughout
the rest of the article.)

3.3 A Logical Form for Eventualities
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.978243285714286">
Before using this generalized view of anaphora to show what discourse adverbials
contribute to discourse and how they interact with discourse relations that arise from
adjacency or explicit discourse connectives, we briefly describe how we represent
clausal interpretations in logical form (LF).
Essentially, we follow Hobbs (1985) in using a rich ontology and a representation
scheme that makes explicit all the individuals and abstract objects (i.e., propositions,
facts/beliefs, and eventualities) (Asher 1993) involved in the LF interpretation of an
utterance. We do so because we want to make intuitions about individuals, eventual-
ities, lexical meaning, and anaphora as clear as possible. But certainly, other forms of
representation are possible.
In this LF representation scheme, each clause and each relation between clauses
is indexed by the label of its associated abstract object. So, for example, the LF inter-
pretation of the sentence
(34) John left because Mary left.

would be written
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.773065">
e1:left(j) ∧ john(j) ∧ e2:left(m) ∧ mary(m) ∧ e3:because(e1,e2)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.973313769230769">
where the first argument of the asymmetric binary predicate because is the consequent
and the second is the eventuality leading to this consequent. Thus when because occurs
sentence-medially, as in the above example, the eventuality arguments are in the same
order as their corresponding clauses occur in the text. When because occurs sentence-
initially (as in Because Mary left, John did), the interpretation of the second clause (John
[left]) will appear as the first argument and the interpretation of the first clause (Mary
left) will appear as the second.9
The set of available discourse referents includes both individuals like j and m, and
also abstract objects like e1 and e2. We then represent resolved anaphors by reusing
these discourse referents. So, for example, the LF interpretation of the follow-on sen-
tence
(35) This upset Sue.
would be written
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.635053">
e4:upset(DPRO, s) ∧ sue(s)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999915333333333">
where DPRO is the anaphoric variable contributed by the demonstrative pronoun this.
Since the subject of upset could be either the eventuality of John’s leaving or the fact
that he left because Mary left, DPRO could be resolved to either e1 or e3, that is,
</bodyText>

affect how discourse adverbials are resolved. Thus, for example, we are not bothering to distinguish
among different senses of because (epistemic vs. nonepistemic), while (temporal vs. concessive), since
(temporal vs. causal), etc. Of course, these distinctions are important to discourse interpretation, but
they are independent of and orthogonal to the points made in this article. Similarly, Asher (1993)
argues that a simple ontology of eventualities is too coarse-grained, and that discourse representations
need to distinguish different kinds of abstract objects, including actions, propositions, and facts as well
as eventualities. Different discourse connectives will require different kinds of abstract objects as
arguments. This distinction is also orthogonal to the points made in this article, because we can
understand these abstract referents to be associates of the corresponding Hobbsian eventualities and
leave the appropriate choice to the lexical semantics of discourse connectives. Byron (2002) advocates a
similar approach to resolving discourse anaphora.

As for resolving EV, in a well-known article, Moens and Steedman (1988) discuss
several ways in which an eventuality of one type (e.g., a process) can be coerced into
an eventuality of another type (e.g., an accomplishment, which Moens and Steedman
call a culminated process). In this case, the matrix argument of then (the eventuality of
turning right on County Line) can be used to coerce the process eventuality in (37b) into
a culminated process of going west on Lancaster Avenue until County Line. We treat this
coercion as a type of associative or bridging inference, as in the examples discussed
in section 3.1. That is,
e2 = culmination(e1)∈assoc(e1), where e1:go-west(you, lancaster ave)
Taking this e2 as the anaphoric argument EV of then yields the proposition
after(e3, e2)
That is, the eventuality of turning right onto County Line is after that of going west
on Lancaster Avenue to County Line. This proposition would be indexed and added
to the discourse context.
It is important to stress here that the level of representation we are concerned
with is essentially an LF for discourse. Any reasoning that might then have to be done
on the content of LFs might then require making explicit the different modal and
temporal contexts involved, their accessibility relations, the status of abstract objects
as facts, propositions or eventualities, and so on. But as our goal here is primarily
to capture the mechanism by means of which discourse adverbials are involved in
discourse structure and discourse semantics, we will continue to assume for as long
as possible that an LF representation will suffice.
Now it may appear as if there is no difference between treating adverbials as
anaphors and treating them as structural connectives, especially in cases like (37) in
which the antecedent comes from the immediately left-adjacent context, and in which
the only obvious semantic relation between the adjacent sentences appears to be the
one expressed by the discourse adverbial. (Of course, there may also be a separate
intentional relation between the two sentences [Moore and Pollack 1992], independent
of the relation conveyed by the discourse adverbial.)
One must distinguish, however, between whether a theory allows a distinction
to be made and whether that distinction needs to be made in a particular case. It
is clear that there are many examples in which the two approaches (i.e., a purely
structural treatment of all connectives, versus one that treats adverbials as linking into
the discourse context anaphorically) appear to make the same prediction. We have
already, however, demonstrated cases in which a purely structural account makes the
wrong prediction, and in the next section, we will demonstrate the additional power
of an account that allows for two relations between an adverbial’s matrix clause or
sentence and the previous discourse: one arising from the anaphoric connection and
the other inferred from adjacency or conveyed explicitly by a structural connective.
Before closing this section, we want to step through examples (19)–(20), repeated
here as examples (38)–(39).

Roughly speaking, otherwise conveys that the complement of its anaphorically derived
argument serves as the condition under which the interpretation of its structural ar-
gument holds. (This complement must be with respect to some contextually relevant
set.)10
If we represent a conditional relation between two eventualities with the asym-
metric relation if(e1,e2), where e1 is derived from the antecedent and e2 from the conse-
quent, and we approximate a single contextually relevant alternative e2 to an eventu-
ality e1 using a symmetric complement relation, complement(e1, e2), then we can represent
the interpretation of otherwise as
A x . if(VE, x), where complement(VE, EV)
where variable EV is resolved anaphorically to an eventuality in the current discourse
context that admits a complement. That is, otherwise requires a contextually relevant
complement to its antecedent and asserts that if that complement holds, the argument
to the A-expression will as well. The resulting A-expression applies to the interpretation
of the matrix clause of otherwise, resulting in the conditional’s being added to the
discourse context:
[Ax . if(VE,x)] Q ≡ if(VE,Q), where complement(VE,EV)

As we showed in section 2.2, different ways of resolving the anaphoric argument lead
to different interpretations. In (38), the anaphoric argument is resolved to e2:stop(you),
10 Kruijff-Korbayov´a and Webber (2001a) demonstrate that the information structure of sentences in the
previous discourse (theme-rheme partitioning, as well as focus within theme and within rheme
[Steedman 2000a]) can influence what eventualities er are available for resolving the anaphorically
derived argument of otherwise. This then correctly predicts different interpretations for “otherwise” in
(i) and (ii):
(i) Q. How should I transport the dog?
A. You should CARRY the dog. Otherwise you might get HURT.
(ii) Q. What should I carry?
A. You should carry THE DOG. Otherwise you might get HURT.
In both (i) and (ii), the questions constrain the theme/rheme partition of the answer. Small capitals

We have not been specific about how the anaphoric argument of otherwise (or
of any other discourse adverbial) is resolved, other than having it treated as a con-
straint satisfaction problem. This is the subject of current and future work, exploring
the empirical properties of resolution algorithms with data drawn from appropriately
annotated corpora and from psycholinguistic studies of human discourse interpreta-
tion. To this end, Creswell et al. (2002) report on a preliminary annotation study of
discourse adverbials and the location and type of their antecedents. This initial ef-
fort involves nine discourse adverbials—three each from the classes of concessive,
result, and reinforcing (additive) conjuncts given in Quirk et al. (1972). Meanwhile,
Venditti et al. (2002) present a preliminary report on the use of a constraint satisfac-
tion model of interpretation, crucially combining anaphoric and structural reasoning
about discourse relations, to predict subjects’ on-line interpretation of discourses in-
volving stressed pronouns. In addition, two proposals have recently been submitted to
construct a larger and more extensively annotated corpus, covering more adverbials,
based on what we have learned from this initial effort. This more extensive study
would be an adequate basis for developing resolution algorithms.11

In this section, we have presented a general framework for anaphora with the follow-
ing features:
• Anaphors can access one or more discourse referents or entities
associated with them through bridging inferences. These are sufficient
for interpreting anaphoric pronouns, definite NPs and demonstrative
NPs, allowing entities to be evoked by NPs or by clauses. In the case of
clauses, this may be on an as-needed basis, as in Eckert and Strube
(2000).

• A type of anaphor α that we call lexically specified can also contribute
additional meaning through a function fα that is idiosyncratic to α, that

11 With respect to how many discourse adverbials there are, Quirk et al. (1972) discuss 60 conjunctions
and discourse adverbials under the overall heading time relations and 123 under the overall heading
conjuncts. Some entries appear under several headings, so that the total number of conjunctions and
discourse adverbials they present is closer to 160. In another enumeration of discourse adverbials,
Forbes and Webber (2002) start with all annotations of sentence-level adverbials in the Penn Treebank,
then filter them systematically to determine which draw part of their meaning from the preceding
discourse and how they do so. What we understand from both of these studies is that there are fewer
than 200 adverbials to be considered, many of which are minor variations of one another (in contrast, by
contrast, by way of contrast, in comparison, by comparison, by way of comparison that are unlikely to differ in
their anaphoric properties, and some of which, such as contrariwise, hitherto, and to cap it all, will occur
only rarely in a corpus of modern English.

4. Patterns of Anaphoric Relations and Structural/Inferred Relations
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999844029411765">
Prior to the current work, researchers have treated both explicit structural connec-
tives (coordinating and subordinating conjunctions, and “paired” conjunctions) and
discourse adverbials simply as evidence for a particular structural relation holding
between adjacent units. For example, Kehler (2002) takes but as evidence of a contrast
relation between adjacent units, in general as evidence of a generalization relation,
in other words as evidence of an elaboration relation, therefore as evidence of a result
relation, because as evidence of an explanation relation, and even though as evidence
of a denial of preventer relation (Kehler 2002, Section 2.1). Here Kehler has probably
correctly identified the type of relation that holds between elements, but not which
elements it holds between.
In one respect, we follow previous researchers, in that we accept that when clauses,
sentences, or larger discourse units are placed adjacent to one another, listeners infer a
relation between the two, and that the structural connective (coordinate or subordinate
conjunction) gives evidence for the relation that is intended to hold between them.
Because we take discourse adverbials to contribute meaning through an anaphoric
connection with the previous discourse, however, this means that there may be two
relations on offer and opens up the possibility that the relation contributed by the
discourse adverbial can interact in more than one way with the relation conveyed
by a structural connective or inferred through adjacency. Below we show that this
prediction is correct.
We start from the idea that, in the absence of an explicit structural connective, de-
feasible inference correlates with structural attachment of adjacent discourse segments
in discourse structure, relating their interpretations. The most basic relation is that the
following segment in some way describes the same object or eventuality as the one it
abuts (elaboration). But evidence in the segments can lead (via defeasible inference) to
a more specific relation, such as one of the resemblance relations (e.g., parallel, contrast,
exemplification, generalisation), or cause-effect relations (result, explanation, violated expecta-
tion), or contiguity relations (narration) described in Hobbs (1990) and Kehler (2002). If
nothing more specific can be inferred, the relation will remain simply elaboration. What
explicit structural connectives can do is convey relations that are not easy to convey
by defeasible inference (e.g., if, conveying condition, and or, conveying disjunction) or
provide nondefeasible evidence for an inferrable relation (e.g., yet, so, and because).
Discourse adverbials can interact with structural connectives, with adjacency-
triggered defeasible inference, and with each other. To describe the ways in which we

have so far observed discourse adverbials to interact with relations conveyed struc-
turally, we extend the notation used in the previous section:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.927990764705882">
• α = discourse adverbial
• Rα = the name of the relation associated with α
• S = the matrix clause/sentence of α
• u = the logical form (LF) interpretation of S
adding the following:
• D = the discourse unit that is left-adjacent to S, to which a relationship
holds by either inference or a structural connective
• 6 = the LF interpretation of D
• R = the name of the relation that holds with 6
Although 6 is one argument of R, we show below that the other argument of R may
be one of at least two different abstract objects.
Case 1: σ separately serves as an argument to both Rα and R. This is the case that
holds in example (36) (repeated here):
(36) a. John loves Barolo.
b. So he ordered three cases of the ’97.
c. But he had to cancel the order
d. because he then discovered he was broke.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.923833">
We have already seen that the interpretation of the clause in (36d) following because
involves
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.97599">
Rα = after
u = e4:discover(j,e5), where e5:broke(j)
[Ax . after(x,EV)]e4 ≡ after(e4, EV)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9748223">
where EV is resolved to e2:order(j, c1), and the proposition after(e4,e2) is added to the
discourse context—that is, John’s discovering he was broke is after his ordering the
wine.
Now consider the explanation relation R associated with because in (36d). It relates
e4, John’s finding he was broke, to the intepretation of (36c), e3:cancel(j,o1)—that is,
explanation(e4,e3). Clause 36d thus adds both explanation(e4,e3) and after(e4, e2) to the
discourse. Although these two propositions share an argument (e4), they are neverthe-
less distinct.12
12 Because eventuality e4, John’s finding he was broke, both explains the canceling and follows the ordering, it
follows that the canceling is after the ordering.

Case 2: Rα(σ, ei) is an argument of R. In case 1, it is the interpretation of the ad-
verbial’s matrix clause u that serves as one argument to the discourse relation R. In
contrast, in case 2, that argument is filled by the relation contributed by the discourse
adverbial (itself an abstract object available for subsequent reference). In both cases,
the other argument to R is S.
One configuration in which case 2 holds is with the discourse adverbial otherwise.
Recall from section 3.4 that the interpretation of otherwise involves a conditional relation
between the complement of its anaphoric argument and the interpretation u of its
matrix clause:
[Ax . if(VE,x)] u ≡ if(VE,u), where complement(VE,EV)
With variable EV resolved to an eventuality in the discourse context, it is the resulting
relation (viewed as an abstract object) that serves as one argument to R, with S serving
as the other. We can see this most clearly by considering variants of examples (38) and
(39) that contain an explicit connective between the clauses. In (38), the conjunction
because is made explicit (example (40)), and in (39), the connective is simply and or but
(example (41)).

<bodyText confidence="0.993411">
In the case of (40), resolving otherwise contributes the relation
e6: if(e4,e3), where complement(e4,e2) and e2:stop(you)
(If you do something other than stop, you’ll get a ticket.)
At the level of LF, the abstract object e6 that is associated with the conditional relation
serves as one argument to the explanation relation contributed by because, with e2 being
the other. That is, because and otherwise together end up contributing explanation(e2,e6)
(i.e., your needing to stop is explained by the fact that if you do something other than
stop, you’ll get a ticket).
In the case of (41), resolving otherwise contributes the relation
e6l:if(e4l, e3~), where complement(e4,,e1) and e1:red(light)
(If the light is not red, go straight on.)
What is the discourse relation to which otherwise contributes this abstract object e6,?
Whether the connective is and or but, both its conjuncts describe (elaborate) alternative
specializations of the same situation e0 introduced earlier in the discourse (e.g., e0 could
be associated with the first sentence of Go another mile and you’ll get to a bridge. If the
light is red, stop. Otherwise go straight on.) If the connective is and, what is added to
context might simply be elaboration(e6,,e0). (Note that without otherwise, the relation
elaboration(e5,e0) would have been added to context, where e5 is the abstract object
associated with the interpretation of If the light is red, stop.) If the connective is but, then
one might also possibly add contrast(e6,,e5)—that is, the situation that (if the light is

should go straight on.13
As is clear from the original pair of examples (38) and (39), interpretations can
arise through adjacency-triggered inference that are similar to those that arise with an
explicit connective. In either case, the above treatment demonstrates that there is no
need for a separate otherwise relation, as proposed in rhetorical structure theory (Mann
and Thompson 1988). We are not, however, entirely clear at this point when case 1
holds and when case 2 does. A more careful analysis is clearly required.
Case 3: Rα is parasitic on R. Case 3 appears to apply with discourse adverbials such
as for example and for instance. The interpretation of such adverbials appears to be
parasitic on the relation associated with a structural connective or discourse adverbial
to their left, or on an inferred relation triggered by adjacency. The way to understand
this is to first consider intraclausal for example, where it follows the verb, as in

(42) Q. What does this box contain?
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.908472866666667">
A. It contains, for example, some hematite.
The interpretation of for example here involves abstracting the meaning of its matrix
structure with respect to the material to its right, then making an assertion with respect
to this abstraction. That is, if the LF contributed by the matrix clause of (42A) is,
roughly,
i. contain(box1,hematite1)
then the LF resulting from the addition of for example can be written either with set
notation (as in (ii)), taking an entity to exemplify a set, or with λ-notation (as in (iii)),
taking an entity to exemplify a property:
ii. exemplify(hematite1, {X  |contain(box1,X)})
iii. exemplify(hematite1, λX . contain(box1,X))
Both express the fact that hematite is an example of what is contained in the box.14 Since
one can derive (i) logically from either (ii) or (iii), one might choose to retain only (ii) or
(iii) and derive (i) if and when it is needed. In the remainder of the article, we use the
λ notation given in (iii). Note that from the perspective of compositional semantics, for
example resembles a quantifier, in that the scope of its interpretation is not isomorphic
to its syntactic position. Thus producing an interpretation for for example will require
techniques similar to those that have long been used in interpreting quantifiers (Woods,
1978; Barwise and Cooper 1981). We take this up again in section 5.
If we look at the comparable situation in discourse, such as (43)–(44), where for
example occurs to the right of a discourse connective, it can also be seen as abstracting
13 A much finer-grained treatment of the semantics of otherwise in terms of context-update potential is
given in Kruijff-Korbayov´a and Webber (2001b). Here we are just concerned with its interaction with
structural connectives and adjacency-triggered relations.
14 The material to the right of for example can be any kind of constituent, including such strange ones as
John gave, for example, a flower to a nurse.
Here, a flower to a nurse would be an example of the set of object-recipient pairs within John’s givings.
Such nonstandard constituents are also found with coordination, which was one motivation for
combinatory categorial grammar (Steedman 1996). This just illustrates another case in which such
nonstandard constituents are needed.

exemplify(u, AX . after(X,S))

There are at least two explanations: One is that for example simply provides direct
nondefeasible evidence for exemplify, which is the only relation that holds. The other
explanation follows the same pattern as the examples given above, but with no further
relation than elaboration(u,b). That is, we understand in (48) that having database cross-
referencing facilities elaborates the respects in which hypertext books are superior to
normal books, whereas in (49), we understand that the Herald’s [newspaper] consistently
beating its much-larger rival elaborates the claim that its accomplishments were notable. This
elaboration relation is then abstracted (in response to for example) to produce:
exemplify(u, AX . elaboration(X, b))
that is, that this is one example of many possible elaborations. Because this is more
specific than elaboration and seems to mean the same as exemplify(u,b), one might
simply take it to be the only relation that holds. Given that so many naturally occuring
instances of for example occur with elaboration, it is probably useful to persist with the
above shorthand. But it shouldn’t obscure the regular pattern that appears to hold.
Before going on to case 4, we should comment on an ambiguity associated with for
example. When for example occurs after an NP, a PP, or a clause that can be interpreted
as a general concept or a set, it can contribute a relation between the general concept
or set and an instance, rather than being parasitic on another relation. For example,

stance, U.S. dollars. (In British English, the BNC shows that most such examples occur
with such as—i.e., in the construction such as for example. This paraphrase does not work
with the predicate-abstracting for example that is of primary concern here, as in exam-
ple (42).)
But for example occurring after an NP, a PP, or a clause can, alternatively, contribute
a more subtle parasitic relationship to the previous clause, as in

<listItem confidence="0.884337625">
(51) All the children are ill, so Andrew, for example, can’t help out in the shop.
This differs from both (43) and (50). That is, one cannot paraphrase (51) as (52) as in
(43) where for example follows so:
(52) All the children are ill, so for example Andrew can’t help out in the shop.
Example (52) simply specifies an example consequence of all the children being ill, as
does
(53) All the children are ill, so for example one of us has to be at home at all
times.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.980898125">
In contrast, (51) specifies an example consequence for Andrew, as one of the children.
Support for this comes from the fact that in (52), Andrew doesn’t have to be one of
the children: He could be their nanny or child minder, now stuck with dealing with a
lot of sick kids. But (51) is not felicitous if Andrew is not one of the children.
We suspect here the involvement of information structure (Steedman 2000a):
Whereas the interpretation conveyed by for example is parasitic on the adjacency rela-
tion (result in example (51)), its position after the NP Andrew in (51) may indicate a
contrastive theme with respect to the previous clause, according to which Andrew in
contrast to the other children suffers this particular consequence. But more work needs
to be done on this to gain a full understanding of what is going on.
Case 4: Rα is a defeasible rule that incorporates R. Case 4 occurs with discourse
adverbials that carry the same presupposition as the discourse connectives although
and the concessive sense of while (Lagerwerf 1998). Case 4 shares one feature with
case 1, in that the discourse relation R conveyed by a structural connective or inferred
from adjacency holds between u (the interpretation of the adverbial’s matrix clause)
and S (the interpretation of the left-adjacent discourse unit). Where it differs is that
the result is then incorporated into the presupposition of the discourse adverbial. This
presupposition, according to Lagerwerf (1998), has the nature of a presupposed (or
conventionally implicated) defeasible rule that fails to hold in the current situation.
He gives as an example
(54) Although Greta Garbo was called the yardstick of beauty, she never mar-
ried.
This asserts both that Greta Garbo was called the yardstick of beauty and that she
never married. The first implies that Greta Garbo was beautiful. The example also

presupposes that, in general, if a woman is beautiful, she will marry. If such a pre-
supposition can be accommodated, it will simply be added to the discourse context.
If not, the hearer will find the utterance confusing or possibly even insulting.
We argue here that the same thing happens with the discourse adverbials never-
theless and though. The difference is that, with discourse adverbials, the antecedent to
the rule derives anaphorically from the previous discourse, whereas the consequent
derives from the adverbial’s matrix clause. (With the conjunctions although and con-
cessive while, both arguments are provided structurally.)
We first illustrate case 4 with two examples in which nevertheless occurs in the
main clause of a sentence containing a preposed subordinate clause. The subordinate
conjunction helps clarify the relation between the clauses that forms the basis for the
presupposed defeasible rule. After these, we give a further example in which the
relation between the adjacent clauses comes through inference.

Again, we have abstracted over the individual, as the presupposed defeasible rule
associated with the present-tense sentence appears to be more general than a statement
about a particular individual.15
On the other hand, in the following example illustrating a presupposed defeasi-
ble rule and a discourse relation associated with adjacency, it seems possible for the
presupposed defeasible rule to be about John himself:
(57) John is discussing politics. Nevertheless, he is thinking about his fish.
Here the discourse relation between the two clauses, each of which denotes a specific
event, is
during(e2, e1), where e1:discuss(john,politics) and e2:think about(john,fish)

have not addressed, on which further work is needed. Still, we hope that we have
convinced the reader of our main thesis: that by recognizing discourse adverbials
as doing something different from simply signaling the discourse relation between
adjacent discourse units and by considering their contribution as relations in their own
right, one can begin to characterize different ways in which anaphoric and structural
relations may themselves interact.

5. Lexicalized Grammar for Discourse Syntax and Semantics
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999080446808511">
The question we consider in this section is how the treatment we have presented of
discourse adverbials and structural connectives can be incorporated into a general
approach to discourse interpretation. There are three possible ways.
The first possibility is simply to incorporate our treatment of adverbials and con-
nectives into a sentence-level grammar, since such grammars already cover the syntax
of sentence-level conjunction (both coordinate and subordinate) and the syntax of
adverbials of all types. The problem with this approach is that sentence-level gram-
mars, whether phrasal or lexicalized, stop at explicit sentence-level conjunction and do
not provide any mechanism for forming the meaning of multiclausal units that cross
sentence-level punctuation. Moreover, as we have already shown in section 3, the
interpretation of discourse adverbials can interact with the implicit relation between
adjacent sentences, as well as with an explicitly signaled relation, so that a syntax and
compositional semantics that stops at the sentence will not provide all the structures
and associated semantics needed to build the structures and interpretations of interest.
The second possibility is to have a completely different approach to discourse-
level syntax and semantics than to sentence-level syntax and semantics, combining
(for example) a definite clause grammar with rhetorical structure theory. But as we
and others have already noted, this requires discourse semantics reaching further and
further into sentence-level syntax and semantics to handle relations between main and
embedded clauses, and between embedded clauses themselves, as in example (58).
(58) If they’re drunk and they’re meant to be on parade and you go to their
room and they’re lying in a pool of piss, then you lock them up for a day.
(The Independent, June 17, 1997)
Thus it becomes harder and harder to distinguish the scope of discourse-level syntax
and semantics from that at the sentence-level.
The third possibility is to recognize the overlapping scope and similar mechanisms
and simply extend a sentence-level grammar and its associated semantic mechanisms
to discourse. The additional responsibilities of the grammer would be to account for
the formation of larger units of discourse from smaller units; the projection of the
interpretation of smaller discourse units onto the interpretation of the larger discourse
units they participate in; and the effect of discourse unit interpretation on the evolv-
ing discourse model. There are two styles of grammar one could use for this: (1) a
phrase structure grammar (PSG) extended to discourse, as in Figure 6, or (2) a lexi-
calized grammar that extends to discourse, a sentence-level lexicalized grammar such
as tree-adjoining grammar (Joshi, 1987; XTAG-Group 2001) or combinatory categorial
grammar (CCG) (Steedman 1996, 2000b).
Whereas Polanyi and van den Berg (1996) extend a PSG to discourse, we argue
for extending a lexicalized grammar, even though TAG and CCG are weakly context-
sensitive (CS) and the power needed for a discourse grammar with no crossing de-
pendencies is only context-free (section 2.1). Our argument is based on our desire to
use a discourse grammar in natural language generation (NLG). It is well-known that
context-free PSGs (CF PSGs) set up a complex search space for NLG. A discourse
grammar specified in terms of phrase structure rules such as those shown in Figure 6
doesn’t provide sufficient guidance when reversed for use in generating discourse.
For example, one might end up having to guess randomly how many sentences and
connectives one had, in what order, before being able to fill in the sentences and con-
nectives with any content. More generally, trying to generate exactly a given semantics

PS rules for a discourse grammar.
when semantics underspecifies syntactic dependency (as discourse semantics must, on
our account) is known to be intractable (Koller and Striegnitz 2002). An effective so-
lution is to generate semantics and syntax simultaneously, which is straightforward
with a lexicalized grammar (Stone et al. 2001).
Given the importance of various types of inference in discourse understanding,
there is a second argument for using a lexicalized discourse grammar that derives from
the role of implicature in discourse. Gricean reasoning about implicatures requires a
hearer be able to infer the meaningful alternatives that a speaker had in composing a
sentence. With lexicalization, these alternatives can be given by a grammar, allowing
the hearer, for example, to ask sensible questions like “Why did the speaker say ‘in-
stead’ here instead of nothing at all?” and draw implicatures from this. A CF PSG, on
the other hand, might suggest questions like “Why did the speaker say two sentences
rather than one here?” which seem empirically not to lead to any real implicatures.
(On the contrast between choices, which seem to lead to implicatures, and mere alter-
native linguistic formulations, which do not seem to, see, for example, Dale and Reiter
[1995] and Levison [2000].)
In several previous papers (Webber, Knott, and Joshi, 2001; Webber et al., 1999a,
1999b), we described how our approach fits into the framework of tree-adjoining gram-
mar. This led to the initial version of a discourse parser (Forbes et al. 2001) in which
the same parser that builds trees for individual clauses using clause-level LTAG trees
then combines them using discourse-level LTAG trees. Here we simply outline the
grammar, called DLTAG (section 5.1), then show how it supports the approach to
structural and anaphoric discourse connectives presented earlier (section 5.2).
(Of course, one still needs to account for how speakers realize their intentions
through text and how what is achieved through a single unit of text contributes to
what a speaker hopes to achieve through any larger unit in which it is embedded.
Preliminary accounts are given in Grosz and Sidner [1990] and Moser and Moore
[1996]. Given the complex relation between individual sentences and speaker inten-
tions, however, it is unlikely that the relation between multisentence discourse and
speaker intentions can be modeled in a straightforward way similar to the basically
monotonic compositional process that we have discussed in this article for discourse
semantics.)

5.1 DLTAG and Discourse Syntax
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.970085294117647">
A lexicalized TAG begins with the notion of a lexical anchor, which can have one
or more associated tree structures. For example, the verb likes anchors one tree corre-
sponding to John likes apples, another corresponding to the topicalized Apples John likes,
a third corresponding to the passive Apples are liked by John, and others as well. That
is, there is a tree for each minimal syntactic construction in which likes can appear, all
sharing the same predicate-argument structure. This syntactic/semantic encapsulation
is possible because of the extended domain of locality of LTAG.
A lexicalized TAG contains two kinds of elementary trees: initial trees that reflect
basic functor-argument dependencies and auxiliary trees that introduce recursion and
allow elementary trees to be modified and/or elaborated. Unlike the wide variety of
trees needed at the clause level, we have found that extending a lexicalized TAG to
discourse requires only a few elementary tree structures, possibly because clause-level
syntax exploits structural variation in ways that discourse doesn’t.
5.1.1 Initial Trees. DLTAG has initial trees associated with subordinate conjunctions,
with parallel constructions, and with some coordinate conjuctions. We describe each
in turn.
In the large LTAG developed by the XTAG project (XTAG-Group 2001) subordi-
nate clauses are seen as adjuncts to sentences or verb phrases (i.e., as auxiliary trees)
because they are outside the domain of locality of the verb. In DLTAG, however, it
is predicates on clausal arguments (such as coordinate and subordinate conjunctions)
that define the domain of locality. Thus, at this level, these predicates anchor initial
trees into which clauses substitute as arguments. Figure 7 shows the initial trees for (a)
postposed subordinate clauses and (b) preposed subordinate clauses.16 At both leaves
and root is a discourse clause (Dc): a clause or a structure composed of discourse
clauses.
One reason for taking something to be an initial tree is that its local dependencies
can be stretched long distance. At the sentence level, the dependency between apples
and likes in Apples John likes is localized in all the trees for likes. This dependency can
be stretched long distance, as in Apples, Bill thinks John may like. In discourse, as we
noted in section 2, local dependencies can be stretched long distance as well, as in
(59) a. Although John is generous, he’s hard to find.
16 Although in an earlier paper (Webber and Joshi 1998), we discuss reasons for taking the lexical anchors
of the initial trees in Figures 7 and 8 to be feature structures, following the analysis in Knott (1996) and
Knott and Mellish (1996), here we just take them to be specific lexical items.

An initial tree for parallel constructions. This particular tree is for a contrastive construction

b. Although John is generous—for example, he gives money to anyone
who asks him for it—he’s hard to find.
(60) a. On the one hand, John is generous. On the other hand, he’s hard to
find.
b. On the one hand, John is generous. For example, suppose you needed
some money: You’d only have to ask him for it. On the other hand,
he’s hard to find.
Thus DLTAG also contains initial trees for parallel constructions as in (60). Such an
initial tree is shown in Figure 8. Like some initial trees in XTAG (XTAG-Group 2001),
such trees can have a pair of anchors. Since there are different ways in which dis-
course units can be parallel, we assume a different initial tree for contrast (on the one
hand... on the other (hand)... ), disjunction (either... or... ), addition (not only... but also... ),
and concession (admittedly... but... ).
Finally, there are initial trees for structural connectives between adjacent sentences
or clauses that convey a particular relation between the connected units. One clear
example is so, conveying result. Its initial tree is shown in Figure 9. We will have a
better sense of what other connectives to treat as structural as a result of annotation
efforts of the sort described in Creswell et al. (2002).17
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.919463857142857">
5.1.2 Auxiliary Trees. DLTAG uses auxiliary trees in two ways: (1) for discourse units
that continue a description in some way, and (2) for discourse adverbials. Again we
describe each in turn.
17 For example, one might also have initial trees for marked uses of and and or that have a specific
meaning beyond simple conjunction or disjunction, as in
(61) a. Throw another spit ball and you’ll regret it.
b. Eat your spinach or you won’t get dessert.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997916">
These differ from the more frequent, simple coordinate uses of and and or in that the second conjunct
in these marked cases bears a discourse relation to the first conjunct (result in both (61a) and (61b)).
With simple coordinate uses of and and or, all conjuncts (disjuncts) bear the same relation to the same
immediately left-adjacent discourse unit. For example, in (62), each conjunct is a separate explanation
for not trusting John, wheras in (63), each disjunct conveys an alternative result of John’s good fortune:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9773375">
(62) You shouldn’t trust John. He never returns what he borrows, and he bad-mouths his associates
behind their backs.
(63) John just won the lottery. So he will quit his job, or he will at least stop working overtime.
For simple coordinate uses of and and or, we have auxiliary trees (section 5.1.2).

First, auxiliary trees anchored by punctuation (e.g., period, comma, semicolon.) (Fig-
ure 10a) or by simple coordination (Figure 10b) are used to provide further description
of a situation or of one or more entities (objects, events, situations, states, etc.) within
the situation.18 The additional information is conveyed by the discourse clause that fills
its substitution site. Such auxiliary trees are used in the derivation of simple discourses
such as

derivation, the foot node of O:punct1 is adjoined to the root of T1 and its substitution
site filled by T2, resulting in the tree to the right of the horizontal arrow. (A standard
way of indicating TAG derivations is shown under the horizontal arrow, where bro-
ken lines indicate adjunction and solid lines, substitution. Each line is labeled with the
address of the argument at which the operation occurs. T1 is the derivation tree for
T1 and T2, the derivation tree for T2.)
The other auxiliary trees used in the lexicalized discourse grammar are those for
discourse adverbials, which are simply auxiliary trees in a sentence-level LTAG (XTAG-
Group 2001), but with an interpretation that projects up to the discourse level. An
example is shown in Figure 10c. Adjoining such an adverbial to a clausal/sentential
structure contributes to how information conveyed by that structure relates to the
previous discourse.
There is some lexical ambiguity in this grammar, but no more than serious con-
sideration of adverbials and conjunctions demands. First, as already noted, discourse
adverbials have other uses that may not be anaphoric (65a–b) and may not be clausal
(65a–c):

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9994102">
Second, many of the adverbials found in second position in parallel constructions
(e.g., on the other hand, at the same time, nevertheless) can also serve as simple adverbial
discourse connectives on their own. In the first case, they will be one of the two anchors
of an initial tree (Figure 8), and in the second, they will anchor a simple auxiliary tree
(Figure 10c). These lexical ambiguities correlate with structural ambiguity.

5.2 Example Derivations

<bodyText confidence="0.998741333333333">
It should be clear by now that our approach aims to explain discourse semantics in
terms of a product of the same three interpretive mechanisms that operate within
clause-level semantics:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999764333333333">
• compositional rules on syntactic structure (here, discourse structure)
• anaphor resolution
• inference triggered by adjacency and structural connection
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999912846153846">
For the compositional part of semantics in DLTAG (in particular, computing interpre-
tations on derivation trees), we follow Joshi and Vijay-Shanker (2001). Roughly, they
compute interpretations on the derivation tree using a bottom-up procedure. At each
level, function application is used to assemble the interpretation of the tree from the
interpretation of its root node and its subtrees. Where multiple subtrees have function
types, the interpretation procedure is potentially nondeterministic: The resulting am-
biguities in interpretation may be admitted as genuine, or they may be eliminated by a
lexical specification. Multicomponent TAG tree sets are used to provide an appropriate
compositional treatment for quantifiers, which we borrow for interpreting for example
(examples (66c–d)).
In showing how DLTAG and an interpretative process on its derivations operate,
we must, of necessity, gloss over how inference triggered by adjacency or associated
with a structural connective provides the intended relation between adjacent discourse

units: It may be a matter simply of statistical inference, as in Marcu and Echihabi
(2002), or of more complex inference, as in Hobbs et al. (1993). As we noted, our view
is that there are three mechanisms at work in discourse semantics, just as there are in
clause-level semantics: Inference isn’t the only process involved. Thus the focus of our
presentation here is on how compositional rules and anaphor resolution (which itself
often appears to require inference) operate together with inference to yield discourse
semantics.
We start with previous examples (44) (here (66c)) and (47) (here (66d)) and two
somewhat simpler variants (66a–b):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.987212833333333">
(66) a. You shouldn’t trust John because he never returns what he borrows.
b. You shouldn’t trust John. He never returns what he borrows.
c. You shouldn’t trust John because, for example, he never returns what
he borrows.
d. You shouldn’t trust John. For example, he never returns what he bor-
rows.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999930666666667">
This allows us to show how (66a–b) and (66c–d) receive similar interpretations, despite
having somewhat different derivations, and how the discourse adverbial for example
contributes both syntactically and semantically to those interpretations.
We let T1 stand for the LTAG parse tree for you shouldn’t trust John, T1, for its
derivation tree, and interp(T1), for the eventuality associated with its interpretation.
Similarly, we let T2 stand for the LTAG parse tree for he never returns what he bor-
rows, T2, for its derivation tree, and interp(T2), for the eventuality associated with its
interpretation.
Example (66a) involves an initial tree (α:because-mid) anchored by because (Fig-
ure 12). Its derived tree comes from T1 substituting at the left-hand substitution
site of α:because-mid (index 1) and T2 at its right-hand substitution site (index 3).
Compositional interpretation of the resulting derivation tree yields explanation(interp
(T2),interp(T1)). (A more precise interpretation would distinguish between the direct
and epistemic causality senses of because, but the derivation would proceed in the
same way.)
In contrast with (66a), example (66b) employs an auxiliary tree (O:punct1) anchored
by a period (Figure 13). Its derived tree comes from T2 substituting at the right-hand
substitution site (index 3) of O:punct1, and O:punct1 adjoining at the root of T1 (index 0).
Compositional interpretation of the derivation tree yields merely that T2 continues the
description of the situation associated with T1, that is, elaboration(interp(T2),interp(T1)).
Further inference triggered by adjacency and structural connection leads to a con-

clusion of causality between them, that is, explanation(interp(T2),interp(T1)), but this
conclusion is defeasible because it can be denied without a contradiction: for example,
(67) You shouldn’t trust John. He never returns what he borrows. But that’s
not why you shouldn’t trust him.
Example (66c) differs from (66a) in containing for example in its second clause. As
noted earlier, for example resembles a quantifier with respect to its semantics, as its
interpretation takes wider scope than would be explained by its syntactic position. We
handle this in the same way that quantifiers are handled in Joshi and Vijay-Shanker
(2001) by associating with for example a two-element TAG tree set (Figure 14). Both
trees in the tree set participate in the derivation: The auxiliary tree O:for ex1 adjoins
at the root of T2, whereas the auxiliary tree O:for ex2 adjoins at the root of the higher
discourse unit. Since we saw from example (66a) that the interpretation of this higher
discourse unit is explanation(interp(T2),interp(T1)), the interpretation associated with
the adjoined O:for ex2 node both embeds and abstracts this interpretation, yielding
exemplification(interp(T2), AX . explanation(X,interp(T1))
That is, John’s never returning what he borrows is one instance of a set of explanations.
Similarly, example (66d) differs from (66b) in containing for example in its second
sentence (Figure 15). As in example (66b), an inferred relation is triggered between
the interpretations of T2 and T1, namely, explanation(interp(T2),interp(T1)). Then, as
a result of O:for ex1 adjoining at T2 and O:for ex2 adjoining at the root of the higher

exemplification(interp(T2), AX . explanation(X,interp(T1))
Thus (66c) and (66d) differ only in the derivation of the interpretation that for example
then abstracts over.
The next example we will walk through is example (11) (repeated here as exam-
ple (68)):
(68) John loves Barolo. So he ordered three cases of the ’97. But he had to
cancel the order because then he discovered he was broke.
As shown in Figure 16, this example involves two initial trees (α:so, α:because mid) for
the structural connectives so and because; an auxiliary tree for the structural connective
but (/:but), since but functions as a simple conjunction to continue the description of
the situation under discussion; an auxiliary tree (/:then) for the discourse adverbial
then; and initial trees for the four individual clauses T1–T4. As can be seen from the
derivation tree, T1 and T2 substitute into α:so as its first and third arguments, and /:but
root-adjoins to the result. The substitution argument of /:but is filled by α:because mid,
with T3 and T4 substituted in as its first and third arguments, and /:then is root-
adjoined to T4. The interpretation contributed by then, after its anaphoric argument is
resolved to interp(T2), is

Further inference may then refine elaboration to contrast, based on how but is being
used.
Finally, we want to point out one more way in which texts that seem to be close
paraphrases get their interpretations in different ways. Consider the two texts in ex-
ample (69):

Example (69b) is a simpler version of an example in Moser and Moore (1995), in which
This is because is treated as an unanalyzed cue phrase, no different from because in (69a).
We show here that this isn’t necessary: One can analyze (69b) using compositional
semantics and anaphor resolution and achieve the same results.
First consider (69a). Given the interpretations of its two component clauses, its
overall interpretation follows in the same way as (66a), shown in Figure 12. Now

has its two arguments filled by T2, the TAG analysis of this is and TB, the TAG analysis
of part 2 is more susceptible to damage. The overall derived tree for (69b) comes from
O:punct1 root-adjoining to T1 (the TAG analysis of You should eliminate part 2 before
part 3), with the subsitution site of O:punct1 filled by the α:because mid derivation.
The compositional interpretation of the derivation tree yields the interpretation of the
α:because mid tree (i1) as an elaboration of the interpretation of T1:
i1: explanation(interp(TB),interp(T2))
i2: elaboration(i1,interp(T1))
But this is not all. The pronoun this in T2 is resolved anaphorically to the nearest con-
sistent eventuality (Eckert and Strube 2000; Byron 2002) which in this case is interp(T1).
Taking this as the interpretation of T2 and substituting, we get
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.5420885">
i1: explanation(interp(TB),interp(T1))
i2: elaboration(i1,interp(T1))

<bodyText confidence="0.9454470625">
Notice that i1 is also the interpretation of (69a). To this, i2 adds the somewhat redun-
dant information that i1 serves to elaborate the advice in T1. Thus (69a) and (69b)
receive similar interpretations but by different means. This treatment has the added
advantage that one does not have to treat This is not because as a separate cue phrase.
Rather, negation simply produces
i1: ¬explanation(interp(TB),interp(T1))
i2: elaboration(i1,interp(T1))
That is, T1 is elaborated by a denial of a (possible) explanation. Presumably, the text
would go on to provide the actual explanation.
Finally, we want to comment on the Holy Grail of discourse parsing: a realistic
model that is computed in parallel with incremental sentence-level parsing. Neither
the analyses given in this section nor the discourse parsing described in Forbes et
al. (2001) is done in a left-to-right incremental fashion, in parallel with incremental
left-to-right sentence-level parsing.
What would an integrated incremental method of sentence-discourse processing
require? At minimum, we believe it would involve:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.8791985">
• A left-to-right parser that would simultaneously compute increments to

<bodyText confidence="0.999462666666667">
discourse-level syntactic structure, and discourse-level semantics.
Increments to the latter two would occur only at clause boundaries and
with discourse adverbials and structural connectives.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9989646">
• An incremental anaphor resolution mechanism, similar to that in Strube
(1998), but extended both to deictic pronouns, as in Eckert and Strube
(2000) and Byron (2002) and to the anaphoric argument of discourse
adverbials.
• Incremental computation of discourse structure in terms of elaboration

relations and further nondefeasible reasoning to more specific relations,
where possible.
A left-to-right parser that simultaneously produces sentence-level syntactic and
semantic analyses already exists for combinatory categorial grammar (Steedman 1996,

2000b; Hockenmaier, Bierner, and Baldridge, forthcoming), and it would seem straight-
forward to extend such a parser to computing discourse-level syntax and semantics
as well. Similarly, it seems straightforward to produce an incremental version of any
of the current generation of anaphor resolution mechanisms, extended to deictic pro-
nouns, although current approaches attempt to resolve this and that only with the
interpretation of a single clause, not with that of any larger discourse unit. As these
approaches are also not very accurate as yet, incremental anaphor resolution awaits
improvements to anaphor resolution in general. Moreover, as we better understand
the specific anaphoric properties of discourse adverbials through empirical analysis
such as Creswell et al. (2000), such anaphor resolution mechanisms can be extended
to include them as well.
As for building discourse structure incrementally in parallel with syntactic struc-
ture, there is no working prototype yet that will do what is needed. But we have no
doubt that as psycholinguistics and computation together develop a better understand-
ing of incremental semantic processing, researchers’ desire for a working prototype
will eventually result in the development of one.

6. Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998175">
In this article, we have argued that discourse adverbials make an anaphoric, rather than
a structural, connection with the previous discourse (section 2), and we have provided
a general view of anaphora in which it makes sense to talk of discourse adverbials as
being anaphoric (section 3). We have then shown that this view of discourse adverbials
allows us to characterize a range of ways in which the relation contributed by a
discourse adverbial can interact with the relation conveyed by a structural connective
or inferred through adjacency (section 4), and then illustrated how discourse syntax
and semantics can be treated as an extension of sentence-level syntax and semantics,
using a lexicalized discourse grammar (section 5).
We are clearly not the first to have proposed a grammatical treatment of low-level
aspects of discourse semantics (Asher and Lascarides 1999; Gardent 1997; Polanyi and
van den Berg 1996; Scha and Polanyi 1988; Schilder 1997a, 1997b; van den Berg 1996),
but we are the first to have recognized that the key to avoiding problems of maintain-
ing a compositional semantics for discourse lies in recognizing discourse adverbials as
anaphors and not trying to shoehorn everything into a single class of discourse connec-
tives. Although we are not yet able to propose a solution to the problem of correctly
resolving discourse adverbials or a way of achieving the Holy Grail of computing
discourse syntax and semantics in parallel with incremental sentence processing, the
proposed approach does simplify issues of discourse structure and discourse semantics
in ways that have not before been possible.

<abstract confidence="0.991723875">We argue in this article that many common adverbial phrases generally taken to signal a discourse relation between syntactically connected units within discourse structure instead work anaphorically to contribute relational meaning, with only indirect dependence on discourse structure. This allows a simpler discourse structure to provide scaffolding for compositional semantics and reveals multiple ways in which the relational meaning conveyed by adverbial connectives can interact with that associated with discourse structure. We conclude by sketching out a lexicalized grammarfor discourse that facilitates discourse interpretation as a product of compositional rules, anaphor resolution, and inference.</abstract>

Understanding discourse adverbials as anaphors allows us to see more clearly how a lexicalized approach to the computation of clausal syntax and semantics extends naturally to the computation of discourse syntax and semantics, providing a single syntactic and semantic matrix with which to associate speaker intentions and other aspects of pragmatics (section 5.) The account we provide here is meant to be compatible with current approaches to discourse semantics such as DRT (Kamp and Reyle 1993; van Eijck and Kamp 1997), dynamic semantics (Stokhof and Groenendijk 1999), and even SDRT (Asher 1993; Asher and Lascarides 2003), understood as a representational scheme rather than an interpretive mechanism. It is also meant to be compatible with more detailed analyses of the meaning and use of individual discourse adverbials, such as Jayes and Rossari (1998a, 1998b) and Traugott, (1995, 1997). It provides what we believe to be a more coherent account of how discourse meaning is computed, rather than an alternative account of what that meaning is or what speaker intentions it is being used to achieve. 2.

For example, the antecedent er of a singular demonstrative pronoun (in English, this or that) is often an eventuality that derives from a clause, a sentence, or a larger unit in the recent discourse (Asher 1993; Byron 2002; Eckert and Strube 2000; Webber 1991).

Thus, for example, we are not bothering to distinguish among different senses of because (epistemic vs. nonepistemic), while (temporal vs. concessive), since (temporal vs. causal), etc. Of course, these distinctions are important to discourse interpretation, but they are independent of and orthogonal to the points made in this article. Similarly, Asher (1993) argues that a simple ontology of eventualities is too coarse-grained, and that discourse representations need to distinguish different kinds of abstract objects, including actions, propositions, and facts as well as eventualities. Different discourse connectives will require different kinds of abstract objects as arguments. This distinction is also orthogonal to the points made in this article, because we can understand these abstract referents to be associates of the corresponding Hobbsian eventualities and leave the appropriate choice to the lexical semantics of discourse connectives.

Introduction It is a truism that a text means more than the sum of its component sentences. One source of additional meaning are relations taken to hold between adjacent sentences “syntactically” connected within a larger discourse structure. It has been very difficult, however, to say what discourse relations there are, either theoretically (Mann and Thompson 1988; Kehler 2002; Asher and Lascarides 2003) or empirically (Knott 1996). Knott’s empirical attempt to identify and characterize cue phrases as evidence for discourse relations illustrates some of the difficulties. Knott used the following theory-neutral test to identify cue phrases: For a potential cue phrase 0 in naturally occurring text, consider in isolation the clause in which it appears. If the clause appears incomplete without an adjacent left context, whereas it appears complete if 0 is removed, then 0 is a cue phrase. Knott’s test produced a nonexhaustive list of about two hundred different phrases from 226 pages of text. He th</context>

Viewed syntactically, arbitrary DAGs are completely unconstrained systems. They substantially complicate interpretive rules for discourse, in order for those rules to account for the relative scope of unrelated operators and the contribution of syntactic nodes with arbitrarily many parents.1 We are not committed to trees as the limiting case of discourse structure.

This distinction is also orthogonal to the points made in this article, because we can understand these abstract referents to be associates of the corresponding Hobbsian eventualities and leave the appropriate choice to the lexical semantics of discourse connectives. Byron (2002) advocates a similar approach to resolving discourse anaphora. 558 Webber et al. Anaphora and Discourse Structure Using the above LF representation scheme and our notation from Section 3.2, namely, • α = the anaphoric expression (here, the discourse adverbial) • Rα = the relation name linked with α • S = the matrix clause/sentence containing α • u = the interpretation of S as an abstract object and ignoring, for now, the conjunction because (discussed in section 4), the relevant elements of (36d) can be represented as: α = then Rα = after S = he [John] discovered he was broke u = e4:find(j,e5)</context>

The compositional interpretation of the derivation tree yields the interpretation of the α:because mid tree (i1) as an elaboration of the interpretation of T1: i1: explanation(interp(TB),interp(T2)) i2: elaboration(i1,interp(T1)) But this is not all. The pronoun this in T2 is resolved anaphorically to the nearest consistent eventuality (Eckert and Strube 2000; Byron 2002) which in this case is interp(T1). Taking this as the interpretation of T2 and substituting, we get i1: explanation(interp(TB),interp(T1)) i2: elaboration(i1,interp(T1)) Notice that i1 is also the interpretation of (69a). To this, i2 adds the somewhat redundant information that i1 serves to elaborate the advice in T1. Thus (69a) and (69b) receive similar interpretations but by different means.

This is the subject of current and future work, exploring the empirical properties of resolution algorithms with data drawn from appropriately annotated corpora and from psycholinguistic studies of human discourse interpretation. To this end, Creswell et al. (2002) report on a preliminary annotation study of discourse adverbials and the location and type of their antecedents. This initial effort involves nine discourse adverbials—three each from the classes of concessive, result, and reinforcing (additive) conjuncts given in Quirk et al. (1972). Meanwhile, Venditti et al.

One clear example is so, conveying result. Its initial tree is shown in Figure 9. We will have a better sense of what other connectives to treat as structural as a result of annotation efforts of the sort described in Creswell et al. (2002).17 5.1.2 Auxiliary Trees. DLTAG uses auxiliary trees in two ways: (1) for discourse units that continue a description in some way, and (2) for discourse adverbials. Again we describe each in turn. 17 For example, one might also have initial trees for marked uses of and and or that have a specific meaning beyond simple conjunction or disjunction, as in (61) a.

For example, the antecedent er of a singular demonstrative pronoun (in English, this or that) is often an eventuality that derives from a clause, a sentence, or a larger unit in the recent discourse (Asher 1993; Byron 2002; Eckert and Strube 2000; Webber 1991). We will show that this is the case with discourse adverbials as well. The extension we make to the general framework presented above in order to include discourse adverbials as discourse anaphors is to allow more general functions fα to be associated with lexically specified anaphors. In particular, for the discourse adverbials considered in this article, the function associated with an adverbial maps its anaphoric argument—an eventuality derived from the current discourse context—to a function that applies to the interpretation of the adverbial’s matrix clause (itself an event</context>

Our basic view is that resolution is initiated when the discourse adverbial (α) is encountered. As α’s matrix clause S is incrementally parsed and interpreted, producing eventuality u, the resolution process polls the discourse context and either finds an appropriate eventuality e; (or creates one by a bridging inference, as illustrated in the next section) such that Rα(u, e;) makes sense with respect to the discourse so far. As is the case with resolving a discourse deictic (Asher 1993; Byron 2002; Eckert and Strube 2000; Webber 1991) this resolution process would use syntactic and semantic constraints that it accumulates as the incremental sentence-level parser/interpreter processes S. As with discourse deixis, this is best seen as a constraint satisfaction problem that involves finding or deriving an eventuality from the current discourse context that meets the constraints of the adverbial with respect to the eventuality interpretation of the matrix clause. (Examples of this are given throughout the rest of the article.) 3.3 A Logical Form for Eventualities Before using this generalized view of anaphora to </context>

This more extensive study would be an adequate basis for developing resolution algorithms.11 3.5 Summary In this section, we have presented a general framework for anaphora with the following features: • Anaphors can access one or more discourse referents or entities associated with them through bridging inferences. These are sufficient for interpreting anaphoric pronouns, definite NPs and demonstrative NPs, allowing entities to be evoked by NPs or by clauses. In the case of clauses, this may be on an as-needed basis, as in Eckert and Strube (2000). • A type of anaphor α that we call lexically specified can also contribute additional meaning through a function fα that is idiosyncratic to α, that can be applied to either an existing discourse referent or an entity associated with it through a bridging inference. In the case of the premodifier other, fα applied to its argument produces contextually 11 With respect to how many discourse adverbials there are, Quirk et al.

(On the contrast between choices, which seem to lead to implicatures, and mere alternative linguistic formulations, which do not seem to, see, for example, Dale and Reiter [1995] and Levison [2000].) In several previous papers (Webber, Knott, and Joshi, 2001; Webber et al., 1999a, 1999b), we described how our approach fits into the framework of tree-adjoining grammar. This led to the initial version of a discourse parser (Forbes et al. 2001) in which the same parser that builds trees for individual clauses using clause-level LTAG trees then combines them using discourse-level LTAG trees. Here we simply outline the grammar, called DLTAG (section 5.1), then show how it supports the approach to structural and anaphoric discourse connectives presented earlier (section 5.2).

Neither the analyses given in this section nor the discourse parsing described in Forbes et al.

But this isn’t the only reason to recognize discourse adverbials as anaphors: In the next section, we suggest a framework for anaphora that is broad enough to include discourse adverbials as well as definite and demonstrative pronouns and NPs, along with other discourse phenomena that have been argued to be anaphoric, such as VP ellipsis (Hardt 1992, 1999; Kehler 2002), tense (Partee 1984; Webber 1988) and modality (Kibble 1995; Frank and Kamp 1997; Stone and Hardt 1999). 3.

(Examples of this are given throughout the rest of the article.) 3.3 A Logical Form for Eventualities Before using this generalized view of anaphora to show what discourse adverbials contribute to discourse and how they interact with discourse relations that arise from adjacency or explicit discourse connectives, we briefly describe how we represent clausal interpretations in logical form (LF). Essentially, we follow Hobbs (1985) in using a rich ontology and a representation scheme that makes explicit all the individuals and abstract objects (i.e., propositions, facts/beliefs, and eventualities) (Asher 1993) involved in the LF interpretation of an utterance. We do so because we want to make intuitions about individuals, eventualities, lexical meaning, and anaphora as clear as possible. But certainly, other forms of representation are possible. In this LF representation scheme, each clause and each relation between clauses is indexed by the label of its associated abstract object. So, for example, the LF interpretation</context>

The most basic relation is that the following segment in some way describes the same object or eventuality as the one it abuts (elaboration). But evidence in the segments can lead (via defeasible inference) to a more specific relation, such as one of the resemblance relations (e.g., parallel, contrast, exemplification, generalisation), or cause-effect relations (result, explanation, violated expectation), or contiguity relations (narration) described in Hobbs (1990) and Kehler (2002). If nothing more specific can be inferred, the relation will remain simply elaboration. What explicit structural connectives can do is convey relations that are not easy to convey by defeasible inference (e.g., if, conveying condition, and or, conveying disjunction) or provide nondefeasible evidence for an inferrable relation (e.g., yet, so, and because). Discourse adverbials can interact with structural connectives, with adjacencytriggered defeasible inference, and with each other.

There are two styles of grammar one could use for this: (1) a phrase structure grammar (PSG) extended to discourse, as in Figure 6, or (2) a lexicalized grammar that extends to discourse, a sentence-level lexicalized grammar such as tree-adjoining grammar (Joshi, 1987; XTAG-Group 2001) or combinatory categorial grammar (CCG) (Steedman 1996, 2000b). Whereas Polanyi and van den Berg (1996) extend a PSG to discourse, we argue for extending a lexicalized grammar, even though TAG and CCG are weakly contextsensitive (CS) and the power needed for a discourse grammar with no crossing dependencies is only context-free (section 2.1).

These lexical ambiguities correlate with structural ambiguity. 5.2 Example Derivations It should be clear by now that our approach aims to explain discourse semantics in terms of a product of the same three interpretive mechanisms that operate within clause-level semantics: • compositional rules on syntactic structure (here, discourse structure) • anaphor resolution • inference triggered by adjacency and structural connection For the compositional part of semantics in DLTAG (in particular, computing interpretations on derivation trees), we follow Joshi and Vijay-Shanker (2001). Roughly, they compute interpretations on the derivation tree using a bottom-up procedure. At each level, function application is used to assemble the interpretation of the tree from the interpretation of its root node and its subtrees. Where multiple subtrees have function types, the interpretation procedure is potentially nondeterministic: The resulting ambiguities in interpretation may be admitted as genuine, or they may be eliminated by a lexical specification.

He never returns what he borrows. But that’s not why you shouldn’t trust him. Example (66c) differs from (66a) in containing for example in its second clause. As noted earlier, for example resembles a quantifier with respect to its semantics, as its interpretation takes wider scope than would be explained by its syntactic position. We handle this in the same way that quantifiers are handled in Joshi and Vijay-Shanker (2001) by associating with for example a two-element TAG tree set (Figure 14). Both trees in the tree set participate in the derivation: The auxiliary tree O:for ex1 adjoins at the root of T2, whereas the auxiliary tree O:for ex2 adjoins at the root of the higher discourse unit. Since we saw from example (66a) that the interpretation of this higher discourse unit is explanation(interp(T2),interp(T1)), the interpretation associated with the adjoined O:for ex2 node both embeds and abstracts this interpretation, yielding exemplification(interp(T2), AX . explanation(X,interp(T1)) That is, John’s never r</context>

Both points are discussed further in section 4. 4. Understanding discourse adverbials as anaphors allows us to see more clearly how a lexicalized approach to the computation of clausal syntax and semantics extends naturally to the computation of discourse syntax and semantics, providing a single syntactic and semantic matrix with which to associate speaker intentions and other aspects of pragmatics (section 5.) The account we provide here is meant to be compatible with current approaches to discourse semantics such as DRT (Kamp and Reyle 1993; van Eijck and Kamp 1997), dynamic semantics (Stokhof and Groenendijk 1999), and even SDRT (Asher 1993; Asher and Lascarides 2003), understood as a representational scheme rather than an interpretive mechanism. It is also meant to be compatible with more detailed analyses of the meaning and use of individual discourse adverbials, such as Jayes and Rossari (1998a, 1998b) and Traugott, (1995, 1997). It provides what we believe to be a more coherent account of how discourse meaning is computed, rather than an alternative account of what that meaning is or what speaker intentions it is being used</context>

We conclude by sketching out a lexicalized grammarfor discourse that facilitates discourse interpretation as a product of compositional rules, anaphor resolution, and inference. 1. Introduction It is a truism that a text means more than the sum of its component sentences. One source of additional meaning are relations taken to hold between adjacent sentences “syntactically” connected within a larger discourse structure. It has been very difficult, however, to say what discourse relations there are, either theoretically (Mann and Thompson 1988; Kehler 2002; Asher and Lascarides 2003) or empirically (Knott 1996). Knott’s empirical attempt to identify and characterize cue phrases as evidence for discourse relations illustrates some of the difficulties. Knott used the following theory-neutral test to identify cue phrases: For a potential cue phrase 0 in naturally occurring text, consider in isolation the clause in which it appears. If the clause appears incomplete without an adjacent left context, whereas it appears complete if 0 is removed, then 0 is a cue phrase.

This is a goal that researchers have been pursuing for some time, using both compositional rules and defeasible inference to determine these additional aspects of meaning (Asher and Lascarides 1999; Gardent 1997; Hobbs et al. 1993; Kehler 2002; Polanyi and van den Berg 1996; Scha and Polanyi 1988; Schilder 1997a, 1997b; van den Berg 1996) If that portion of discourse semantics that can be handled by mechanisms already needed for resolving other forms of anaphora and deixis is factored out, there is less need to stretch and possibly distort compositional rules and defeasible inference to handle everything.2 Moreover, recognizing the possibility of two separate relations (one derived anaphorically and one associated with adjacency and/or a structural connective) admits additional richness to discourse semantics.

Patterns of Anaphoric Relations and Structural/Inferred Relations Prior to the current work, researchers have treated both explicit structural connectives (coordinating and subordinating conjunctions, and “paired” conjunctions) and discourse adverbials simply as evidence for a particular structural relation holding between adjacent units. For example, Kehler (2002) takes but as evidence of a contrast relation between adjacent units, in general as evidence of a generalization relation, in other words as evidence of an elaboration relation, therefore as evidence of a result relation, because as evidence of an explanation relation, and even though as evidence of a denial of preventer relation (Kehler 2002, Section 2.1). Here Kehler has probably correctly identified the type of relation that holds between elements, but not which elements it holds between.

The most basic relation is that the following segment in some way describes the same object or eventuality as the one it abuts (elaboration). But evidence in the segments can lead (via defeasible inference) to a more specific relation, such as one of the resemblance relations (e.g., parallel, contrast, exemplification, generalisation), or cause-effect relations (result, explanation, violated expectation), or contiguity relations (narration) described in Hobbs (1990) and Kehler (2002). If nothing more specific can be inferred, the relation will remain simply elaboration. What explicit structural connectives can do is convey relations that are not easy to convey by defeasible inference (e.g., if, conveying condition, and or, conveying disjunction) or provide nondefeasible evidence for an inferrable relation (e.g., yet, so, and because). Discourse adverbials can interact with structural connectives, with adjacencytriggered defeasible inference, and with each other.

An effective solution is to generate semantics and syntax simultaneously, which is straightforward with a lexicalized grammar (Stone et al. 2001). Given the importance of various types of inference in discourse understanding, there is a second argument for using a lexicalized discourse grammar that derives from the role of implicature in discourse. Gricean reasoning about implicatures requires a hearer be able to infer the meaningful alternatives that a speaker had in composing a sentence. With lexicalization, these alternatives can be given by a grammar, allowing the hearer, for example, to</context>

Anaphora and Discourse Structure Note that our only concern here is with the compositional and anaphoric mechanisms by which adverbials contribute meaning. For detailed analysis of the lexical semantics of adverbials (but no attention to mechanism), the reader is referred to Jayes and Rossari (1998a, 1998b, Lagerwerf (1998), Traugott (1995, 1997), and others. Formally, we represent the function that a discourse adverbial α contributes as a A-expression involving a binary relation Rα that is idiosyncratic to α, one of whose arguments (represented here by the variable EV) is resolved anaphorically: Ax . Rα(x, EV) Rα gets its other argument compositionally, when this A-expression is applied to α’s matrix clause S interpreted as an eventuality u, that is, [Ax .

But more work needs to be done on this to gain a full understanding of what is going on. Case 4: Rα is a defeasible rule that incorporates R. Case 4 occurs with discourse adverbials that carry the same presupposition as the discourse connectives although and the concessive sense of while (Lagerwerf 1998). Case 4 shares one feature with case 1, in that the discourse relation R conveyed by a structural connective or inferred from adjacency holds between u (the interpretation of the adverbial’s matrix clause) and S (the interpretation of the left-adjacent discourse unit). Where it differs is that the result is then incorporated into the presupposition of the discourse adverbial. This presupposition, according to Lagerwerf (1998), has the nature of a presupposed (or conventionally implicated) defeasible rule that fails to hold in the current situation. He gives as an example (54) Although Greta G</context>

Nevertheless, he is thinking about his fish. Here the discourse relation between the two clauses, each of which denotes a specific event, is during(e2, e1), where e1:discuss(john,politics) and e2:think about(john,fish) (Note that our LF representation isn’t sufficiently rich to express the difference between (55) and (57).) What nevertheless contributes here is the presupposed defeasible rule during(X,e1) &gt; ¬X = e2 Normally what occurs during John’s discussing politics is not John’s thinking about his fish. Lagerwerf (1998) does not discuss how specific or general will be the presupposed defeasible rule that is accommodated or what factors affect the choice. KruijffKorbayov´a and Webber (2001a) also punt on the question, when considering the effect of information structure on what presupposed defeasible rule is associated with although. Again, this seems to be a topic for future work.

In either case, the above treatment demonstrates that there is no need for a separate otherwise relation, as proposed in rhetorical structure theory (Mann and Thompson 1988). We are not, however, entirely clear at this point when case 1 holds and when case 2 does. A more careful analysis is clearly required. Case 3: Rα is parasitic on R. Case 3 appears to apply with discourse adverbials such as for example and for instance. The interpretation of such adverbials appears to be parasitic on the relation associated with a structural connective or discourse adverbial to their left, or on an inferred relation triggered by adjacency.

Multicomponent TAG tree sets are used to provide an appropriate compositional treatment for quantifiers, which we borrow for interpreting for example (examples (66c–d)). In showing how DLTAG and an interpretative process on its derivations operate, we must, of necessity, gloss over how inference triggered by adjacency or associated with a structural connective provides the intended relation between adjacent discourse 577 Computational Linguistics Volume 29, Number 4 units: It may be a matter simply of statistical inference, as in Marcu and Echihabi (2002), or of more complex inference, as in Hobbs et al. (1993). As we noted, our view is that there are three mechanisms at work in discourse semantics, just as there are in clause-level semantics: Inference isn’t the only process involved. Thus the focus of our presentation here is on how compositional rules and anaphor resolution (which itself often appears to require inference) operate together with inference to yield discourse semantics.

Coreference and indirect anaphora can be uniformly modeled by saying that the discourse referent eα denoted by an anaphoric expression α is either equal to or associated with an existing discourse referent er, that is, eα=er or eα Eassoc(er). But coreference and associative anaphora do not exhaust the space of constructs that derive all or part of their sense from the discourse context and are thus anaphoric. Consider “other NPs” (Bierner 2001a; Bierner and Webber 2000; Modjeska 2001, 2002), as in: (26) Sue grabbed one phone, as Tom darted to the other phone. Although “other NPs” are clearly anaphoric, should the referent of the other phone (eα)—the phone other than the one Sue grabbed (er)—simply be considered a case of eα E assoc(er)? Here are two reasons why they should not. First, in all cases of associative anaphora discussed in the literature, possible associations have depended only on the antecedent er and not on the anaphor. For example, only antecedents that have parts participate in whole-part associations (e.g., phone → receiver). Only antecedents with functio</context>

Together, these two points argue for a third possibility, in which an anaphoric element can convey a specific function fα that is idiosyncratic to the anaphor, which may be applied to either er or an associate of er. The result of that application is eα. For want of a better name, we will call these lexically specified anaphors. Other lexically specified anaphors include noun phrases headed by other (example (28)), NPs with such but no postmodifying as phrase (example (29)), comparative 7 Modjeska (2001) discovered such examples in the British National Corpus. 555 Computational Linguistics Volume 29, Number 4 NPs with no postmodifying than phrase (example (30)), and the pronoun elsewhere (example (31)) (Bierner 2001b) (28) Some dogs are constantly on the move.

In this case, the matrix argument of then (the eventuality of turning right on County Line) can be used to coerce the process eventuality in (37b) into a culminated process of going west on Lancaster Avenue until County Line.

Now it may appear as if there is no difference between treating adverbials as anaphors and treating them as structural connectives, especially in cases like (37) in which the antecedent comes from the immediately left-adjacent context, and in which the only obvious semantic relation between the adjacent sentences appears to be the one expressed by the discourse adverbial. (Of course, there may also be a separate intentional relation between the two sentences [Moore and Pollack 1992], independent of the relation conveyed by the discourse adverbial.) One must distinguish, however, between whether a theory allows a distinction to be made and whether that distinction needs to be made in a particular case. It is clear that there are many examples in which the two approaches (i.e., a purely structural treatment of all connectives, versus one that treats adverbials as linking into the discourse context anaphorically) appear to make the same prediction. We have already, however, demonstrated cases in which a purely structural account makes the wrong prediction, and in the next </context>

But this isn’t the only reason to recognize discourse adverbials as anaphors: In the next section, we suggest a framework for anaphora that is broad enough to include discourse adverbials as well as definite and demonstrative pronouns and NPs, along with other discourse phenomena that have been argued to be anaphoric, such as VP ellipsis (Hardt 1992, 1999; Kehler 2002), tense (Partee 1984; Webber 1988) and modality (Kibble 1995; Frank and Kamp 1997; Stone and Hardt 1999). 3.

Somewhat more complex than coreference is indirect anaphora (Hellman and Fraurud 1996) (also called partial anaphora [Luperfoy 1992], textual ellipsis [Hahn, Markert, and Strube 1996], associative anaphora [Cosse 1996] bridging anaphora [Clark 1975; Clark and Marshall 1981; Not, Tovena, and Zancanaro 1999], and inferrables [Prince 1992]), in which the anaphor (usually a definite NP) denotes a discourse referent associated with one (or more) discourse referents in the current discourse context; for example, (25) Myra darted to a phone and picked up the receiver. Here the receiver denotes the receiver associated with (by virtue of being part of) the already-mentioned phone Myra darted to.

This is the subject of current and future work, exploring the empirical properties of resolution algorithms with data drawn from appropriately annotated corpora and from psycholinguistic studies of human discourse interpretation. To this end, Creswell et al. (2002) report on a preliminary annotation study of discourse adverbials and the location and type of their antecedents. This initial effort involves nine discourse adverbials—three each from the classes of concessive, result, and reinforcing (additive) conjuncts given in Quirk et al. (1972). Meanwhile, Venditti et al. (2002) present a preliminary report on the use of a constraint satisfaction model of interpretation, crucially combining anaphoric and structural reasoning about discourse relations, to predict subjects’ on-line interpretation of discourses involving stressed pronouns. In addition, two proposals have recently been submitted to construct a larger and more extensively annotated corpus, covering more adverbials, based on what we have learned from this initial effort. This more extensive study would be an adequate basis for developing resolution algorithms.11 3.5 Summa</context>

In another enumeration of discourse adverbials, Forbes and Webber (2002) start with all annotations of sentence-level adverbials in the Penn Treebank, then filter them systematically to determine which draw part of their meaning from the preceding discourse and how they do so.

We are clearly not the first to have proposed a grammatical treatment of low-level aspects of discourse semantics (Asher and Lascarides 1999; Gardent 1997; Polanyi and van den Berg 1996; Scha and Polanyi 1988; Schilder 1997a, 1997b; van den Berg 1996), but we are the first to have recognized that the key to avoiding problems of maintaining a compositional semantics for discourse lies in recognizing discourse adverbials as anaphors and not trying to shoehorn everything into a single class of discourse connectives.

Here, a flower to a nurse would be an example of the set of object-recipient pairs within John’s givings.

There are two styles of grammar one could use for this: (1) a phrase structure grammar (PSG) extended to discourse, as in Figure 6, or (2) a lexicalized grammar that extends to discourse, a sentence-level lexicalized grammar such as tree-adjoining grammar (Joshi, 1987; XTAG-Group 2001) or combinatory categorial grammar (CCG) (Steedman 1996, 2000b). Whereas Polanyi and van den Berg (1996) extend a PSG to discourse, we argue for extending a lexicalized grammar, even though TAG and CCG are weakly contextsensitive (CS) and the power needed for a discourse grammar with no crossing dependencies is only context-free (section 2.1). Our argument is based on our desire to use a discourse grammar in natural language generation (NLG). It is well-known that context-free PSGs (CF PSGs) set up a complex search space for NLG.

The account we provide here is meant to be compatible with current approaches to discourse semantics such as DRT (Kamp and Reyle 1993; van Eijck and Kamp 1997), dynamic semantics (Stokhof and Groenendijk 1999), and even SDRT (Asher 1993; Asher and Lascarides 2003), understood as a representational scheme rather than an interpretive mechanism.

An effective solution is to generate semantics and syntax simultaneously, which is straightforward with a lexicalized grammar (Stone et al. 2001). Given the importance of various types of inference in discourse understanding, there is a second argument for using a lexicalized discourse grammar that derives from the role of implicature in discourse. Gricean reasoning about implicatures requires a hearer be able to infer the meaningful alternatives that a speaker had in composing a sentence. With lexicalization, these alternatives can be given by a grammar, allowing the hearer, for example, to ask sensible questions like “Why did the speaker say ‘instead’ here instead of nothing at all?” and draw implicatures from this.

But this isn’t the only reason to recognize discourse adverbials as anaphors: In the next section, we suggest a framework for anaphora that is broad enough to include discourse adverbials as well as definite and demonstrative pronouns and NPs, along with other discourse phenomena that have been argued to be anaphoric, such as VP ellipsis (Hardt 1992, 1999; Kehler 2002), tense (Partee 1984; Webber 1988) and modality (Kibble 1995; Frank and Kamp 1997; Stone and Hardt 1999). 3.

The general framework is presented in Section 3.1, and the extension in Section 3.2. 3.1 Discourse Referents and Anaphor Interpretation The simplest discourse anaphors are coreferential: definite pronouns and definite NPs that denote one (or more) discourse referents in focus within the current discourse 6 Although rhetorical structure theory (RST) (Mann and Thompson 1998) was developed as an account of the relation between adjacent units</context>

This is the subject of current and future work, exploring the empirical properties of resolution algorithms with data drawn from appropriately annotated corpora and from psycholinguistic studies of human discourse interpretation. To this end, Creswell et al. (2002) report on a preliminary annotation study of discourse adverbials and the location and type of their antecedents. This initial effort involves nine discourse adverbials—three each from the classes of concessive, result, and reinforcing (additive) conjuncts given in Quirk et al. (1972). Meanwhile, Venditti et al. (2002) present a preliminary report on the use of a constraint satisfaction model of interpretation, crucially combining anaphoric and structural reasoning about discourse relations, to predict subjects’ on-line interpretation of discourses involving stressed pronouns. In addition, two proposals have recently been submitted to construct a larger and more extensively annotated corpus, covering more adverbials, based on what we have learned from this initial effort. This more extensive study would be an adequate basis for developing resolution algorithms.11 3.5 Summary In this section, we have present</context>

But this isn’t the only reason to recognize discourse adverbials as anaphors: In the next section, we suggest a framework for anaphora that is broad enough to include discourse adverbials as well as definite and demonstrative pronouns and NPs, along with other discourse phenomena that have been argued to be anaphoric, such as VP ellipsis (Hardt 1992, 1999; Kehler 2002), tense (Partee 1984; Webber 1988) and modality (Kibble 1995; Frank and Kamp 1997; Stone and Hardt 1999). 3. A Framework for Anaphora Here we show how only a single extension to a general framework for discourse anaphora is needed to cover discourse adverbials. The general framework is presented in Section 3.1, and the extension in Section 3.2. 3.1 Discourse Referents and Anaphor Interpretation The simplest discourse anaphors are coreferential: definite pronouns and definite NPs that denote one (or more) discourse referents in focus within the current discourse 6 Although rhetorical structure theory (RST) (Mann and Thompson 19</context>

For example, the antecedent er of a singular demonstrative pronoun (in English, this or that) is often an eventuality that derives from a clause, a sentence, or a larger unit in the recent discourse (Asher 1993; Byron 2002; Eckert and Strube 2000; Webber 1991). We will show that this is the case with discourse adverbials as well. The extension we make to the general framework presented above in order to include discourse adverbials as discourse anaphors is to allow more general functions fα to be associated with lexically specified anaphors. In particular, for the discourse adverbials considered in this article, the function associated with an adverbial maps its anaphoric argument—an eventuality derived from the current discourse context—to a function that applies to the interpretation of the adverbial’s matrix clause (itself an eventuality). The r</context>

Our basic view is that resolution is initiated when the discourse adverbial (α) is encountered. As α’s matrix clause S is incrementally parsed and interpreted, producing eventuality u, the resolution process polls the discourse context and either finds an appropriate eventuality e; (or creates one by a bridging inference, as illustrated in the next section) such that Rα(u, e;) makes sense with respect to the discourse so far. As is the case with resolving a discourse deictic (Asher 1993; Byron 2002; Eckert and Strube 2000; Webber 1991) this resolution process would use syntactic and semantic constraints that it accumulates as the incremental sentence-level parser/interpreter processes S. As with discourse deixis, this is best seen as a constraint satisfaction problem that involves finding or deriving an eventuality from the current discourse context that meets the constraints of the adverbial with respect to the eventuality interpretation of the matrix clause.

At the sentence level, the dependency between apples and likes in Apples John likes is localized in all the trees for likes. This dependency can be stretched long distance, as in Apples, Bill thinks John may like. In discourse, as we noted in section 2, local dependencies can be stretched long distance as well, as in (59) a.

Then Knott’s substitution patterns among cue phrases may have reflected these complex interactions, as well as the meanings of individual cue phrases themselves. This article argues that cue phrases do depend on another mechanism for conveying extrasentential meaning—specifically, anaphora. One early hint that adverbial cue phrases (called here discourse connectives) might be anaphoric can be found in an ACL workshop paper in which Janyce Wiebe (1993) used the following example to question the adequacy of tree structures for discourse: (1) a.

There are two styles of grammar one could use for this: (1) a phrase structure grammar (PSG) extended to discourse, as in Figure 6, or (2) a lexicalized grammar that extends to discourse, a sentence-level lexicalized grammar such as tree-adjoining grammar (Joshi, 1987; XTAG-Group 2001) or combinatory categorial grammar (CCG) (Steedman 1996, 2000b). Whereas Polanyi and van den Berg (1996) extend a PSG to discourse, we argue for extending a lexicalized grammar, even though TAG and CCG are weakly contextsensitive (CS) and the power needed for a discourse grammar with no crossing dependencies is only context-free (section 2.1). Our argument is based on our desire to use a discourse grammar in natural language generation (NLG). It is well-known that context-free PSGs (CF PSGs) set up a complex search space for NLG.

Unlike the wide variety of trees needed at the clause level, we have found that extending a lexicalized TAG to discourse requires only a few elementary tree structures, possibly because clause-level syntax exploits structural variation in ways that discourse doesn’t. 5.1.1 Initial Trees. DLTAG has initial trees associated with subordinate conjunctions, with parallel constructions, and with some coordinate conjuctions. We describe each in turn. In the large LTAG developed by the XTAG project (XTAG-Group 2001) subordinate clauses are seen as adjuncts to sentences or verb phrases (i.e., as auxiliary trees) because they are outside the domain of locality of the verb. In DLTAG, however, it is predicates on clausal arguments (such as coordinate and subordinate conjunctions) that define the domain of locality. Thus, at this level, these predicates anchor initial trees into which clauses substitute as arguments. Figure 7 shows the initial trees for (a) postposed subordinate clauses and (b) preposed subordinate clauses.16 At both leaves and root is a discourse clause (Dc): a clause or a structure composed</context>

Thus DLTAG also contains initial trees for parallel constructions as in (60). Such an initial tree is shown in Figure 8. Like some initial trees in XTAG (XTAG-Group 2001), such trees can have a pair of anchors. Since there are different ways in which discourse units can be parallel, we assume a different initial tree for contrast (on the one hand... on the other (hand)... ), disjunction (either... or... ), addition (not only... but also... ), and concession (admittedly... but... ). Finally, there are initial trees for structural connectives between adjacent sentences or clauses that convey a particular relation between the connected units.
