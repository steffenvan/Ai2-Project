The paper describes an approach to auto-
matically select from Indian Language the
appropriate lexical correspondence of Eng-
lish simple preposition. The paper de-
scribes this task from a Machine Transla-
tion (MT) perspective. We use the proper-
ties of the head and complement of the
preposition to select the appropriate sense
in the target language. We later show that
the results obtained from this approach are
promising.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.923082416666667">
The task of identifying the appropriate sense from
some target language (here, Hindi and Telugu) for
a given simple preposition in some source lan-
guage (here, English) is rather complex for an MT
system, and noting that most foreign language
learners are never able to get a firm hold on prepo-
sitions of a new language (Brala, 2000), this should
not be surprising. A simple example illustrates the
problem:
(1a) He bought a shirt with tiny collars.
‘with’ gets translated to vaalii in Hindi (hnd).
and as kaligi unna in Telugu (tlg).
(1b) He washed a shirt with soap.
‘with’ gets translated to se in hnd.
and as to (suffixed to head noun) in tlg.
For the above English sentences, if we try to
swap the senses of ‘with’ in their corresponding
target translation, the resulting sentences either
become ill-formed or unfaithful to their English
source. The pervasive use of preposition (or its
equivalent in a given language) in most of the lan-
guages makes it a crucial element during transla-
tion. Inappropriate sense selection of a preposition
during machine translation can have a negative
impact on the quality of the translation, sometimes
changing the semantics of the sentence drastically,
thereby making the preposition sense selection
module a critical component of any reliable MT
system.
Finding the proper attachment site for the prepo-
sition in English, i.e. getting the correct parse for
the prepositional phrase (PP) is a classic problem
in MT, and this information can be used to identify
the sense of a preposition. Figure 1 and Figure 2
below show the correct attachment site of PPs in
example (1a) and (1b) respectively.

The correct parse of the PP helps us in selecting
the appropriate sense. However, finding the appro-
priate attachment only reduces the problem. It does
not lead to a ‘complete solution’. The following
examples (2a, 2b and 3a, 3b) have the same at-
tachment site but take different senses in the target
language:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.989889714285714">
(2a) He has had fever for two days now.
‘for’ gets translated as se in hnd.
and as nundi in tlg.
(2b) He had fever for two days.
‘for’ gets translated as taka in hnd.
Not translated in tlg.
(3a) He is going to Delhi.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.973336870967742">
‘to’ gets translated as ko, or preferably left un-
translated in hnd.
and in tlg as ki (suffixed to the head noun), or
may be left un-translated.
(3b) He is going to his mother.
‘to’ gets translated as ke paasa in hnd.
and daggaraku in tlg
After looking at cases such as (2a), (2b) and (3a),
(3b) where the parse is same i.e., preposition ‘for
and ‘to’ get attached to the main verb ‘have’ and
‘go’ respectively, it is clear that we need to come
up with some criterion which can help us in
achieving our task.
There has been extensive work on understanding
prepositions linguistically, often from various an-
gles. Syntactically (Jackendoff, 1977; Emonds,
1985; Rauh, 1993; Pullum and Huddleton, 2002),
from a Cognitive perspective (Lakoff and Johnson,
1980; Langacker, 1987; Brala, 2000), Semantically
by (Saint-Dizier and Vazquez, 2001; Saint-Dizier,
2005), and the Pragmatic aspects by (Fauconnier,
1994).
The work of automatically selecting the correct
sense has also received good amount of attention
and there have been many attempts to solve the
problem. (Japkowicz et. al, 1991) attempts to trans-
late locative prepositions between English and
French. The paper introduces the notion of ‘repre-
sentation of conceptualization’ based in turn on
(Grimaud, 1988). The paper synthesizes this idea
with the thesis of ideal meaning (Herskovits, 1986).
(Tezuka et. al, 2001) have tried to resolve concep-
tual geographical prepositions using inference rule
based on cognitive maps which people have of the
external world. (Hartrumpf et al., 2005) use
knowledge representation formalism for PP inter-
pretation.
Some studies pertain to systems which have
been implemented for MT; (Gustavii, 2005) uses
aligned parallel corpora to induce automatic rules
by applying transformation-based learning. (Alam,
2004) make use of contextual information to de-
termine the meanings of over. (Trujillo, 1992) use
a transfer rule based approach to translate locative
PP-phrase, the approach uses the dependency rela-
tions marked as indices with individual word and a
bilingual lexicon which has mapping between
source and target lexical item (with indices).
(Naskar and Bandyopadhyay, 2005) look at the
semantics of the head noun of the reference object
(this is their main criterion) to get the lexical
meaning of prepositions in an English-Bengali MT
system.
The current paper presents a study of preposi-
tions at, for, in, on, to and with in context of Eng-
lish to Indian language MT system. The paper is
arranged as follows; Section 2 describes our ap-
proach to solving the mentioned task, the 3rd sec-
tion shows the performance of our approach along
with the error analysis during the testing phase, we
conclude the paper along with some future direc-
tion in section 4.

2 Our Approach
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999921052631579">
All the previous attempts can be broadly classified
into 3 main categories; one, where the preposition
is the main focus, concentration is on the semantics
(cognitive or lexical) of the preposition; second,
focus on the verb and the PP which the verb takes
as argument; and lastly, the head noun of the PP
becomes the deciding factor to get the appropriate
sense.
Very few approaches, like (Alam, 2004; Saint-
Dizier and Vazquez, 2001), consider both, the
head (modified) and the complement (modifier)
information, to decide the sense of the preposition.
The modified (or head) is the head of the phrase to
which the PP attaches. The modifier (or
complement) is the head noun of the PP. The
following examples show very clearly why given a
preposition we cannot depend only on the modified
or the modifier separately, and that we must
consider them both to solve the problem.

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999186416666667">
Only considering the modifer ‘his mother’ in 4a
and 4b is not sufficient, likewise taking only the
modified ‘waits’ in 5a and 5b will be insufficient,
both the pairs take different senses and have the
same partial contextual enviornment which is
misleading. Hence, the combined context of
complement-head forms a better candidate for
solving the problem. We come across plenty of
cases where isolated information of
modifier/modified can be misleading.
The task of preposition sense selection can be
divided into;

<listItem confidence="0.91015675">
(a) Getting the correct parse (the task of PP at-
tachment, identification of phrasal verb, etc.),

This paper describes the algorithm for achieving
the above mentioned steps. We assume the input to
our module has the correct parse, i.e. Step (a)
above is assumed here. The proposed algorithm is
a component in English to Indian language MT
system1, therefore, the required input can be pre-
sumed to be available. Steps (b, c) above are rule
based, which make use of the modifier-modified
relation, these relations and the properties of modi-
fier/modified form the core of the context in step
(b). We then apply a series of rules, which specify
the context and semantics in which a sense

2.1 Context and semantic extraction
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999808921052632">
Extraction of context and semantic information (of
modifier/modified) is done automatically by vari-
ous sub-modules which are combined together to
perform the overall task. We use the word ‘con-
text’ very loosely. A context for us is a combina-
tion of various properties which can be syntactic or
lexical, or both; syntactic context can be modifier-
modified relation, lexical properties can be mor-
phological information such as TAM (tense, aspect
and modality) of a verb, class of the verb (Levin,
1993), category of the lexical item and in some
cases the lexical item itself.
The semantics of the modifier and the modified
are captured using WordNet (Miller, 1990), and
certain other resources such as person, place dic-
tionaries, place and time filters (these filters make
use of syntactic cues to mark basic time and place),
etc. We use WordNet to get the hypernyms of a
word. By using this property we can easily get the
broader, more general class/concept for a modi-
fier/modified. Although effective and very intui-
tive, this method has its own problems. We will
elaborate these problems in section 3.2. WordNet
is also used to identify person and place names by
using the hyponym tree for person and place.
Along with the WordNet, as mentioned above,
we use certain other filters such as place and time.
They are used prior to using WordNet. In case a
rule requires the modifier to be a place (rules are
explained in 2.2), this information is acquired from
the place filter. If the filter’s result is negative we
use WordNet. Dictionaries and POS tags are
checked for identifying proper names, we use a
proper name dictionary as POS taggers tend to
have a fixed upper limit especially when it comes
to the identification of named entities. In essence,
the linguistic resources are used in the following
order;

Preliminary results have shown that certain
prepositions occurring in the PP complement of
certain verb classes (Levin, 1993) translate to a
specific sense in Hindi. For example, preposition
‘at’ in the case of peer verbs always translates to
kii tarapha or kii ora in Hindi. This knowledge can

2.2 Sense Selection
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999431142857143">
We have noticed in the previous examples that the
prepositions from English either get translated as
suffixes to the head noun of the PP (in Telugu) or
as postpositions (in Hindi and Telugu). An
example where a preposition in English gets
translated as postposition in its Telugu translation
is shown below;

</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.99957265">
We select the correct sense of the preposition
based on a series of rules which are applied
linearly. These rules have been manually
constructed. We have tried to make the rules
mutually exclusive, so that there are no clashes.
Also, by making sure that the rules are mutually
exclusive we don’t need to worry about the order
in which the rules are listed out in the rule file, thus
making the rule file less fragile. These rules
currently cover around 20 high frequency English
prepositions, these prepositions vary in their
degree of ambiguity; some are highly ambiguous
(e.g. to, by, with, etc.), whereas some are less
ambiguous (e.g. against, around, as, etc.), hence
these are easier to handle.
Various senses on the target side for a given
English preposition are selected on the basis of
rules listed out in a file. The rule file comprises of
tuples, each having 6 attributes.
The attributes are listed below;
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.862422714285714">

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999222714285714">
The rule above requires the modifier to be a
noun and places a constraint “place_close” on it.
We map this constraint (place_close) with some set
of lexical items found in a synset of a hypernym
obtained from WordNet. For example,
“place_close” might correspond to ‘housing’,
‘lodging’, ‘building’, etc in a synset. In essence
“place_close” is place holder for different relations
which might be present in a synset. The modified
category and the modifier category can be ex-
tracted after the correct parse of the PP is known;
the constraints applied on the modified and modi-
fier item (point c, e above) can be of various kinds,
some of them are;
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.823559363636364">
• Semantic relations corresponding to
WordNet hypernyms for a given word
• Presence of the lexical item in some list
(eg. verb class)
• Semantic property such as ‘time’ or ‘place’
• Lexical property such as aspect, negativity
etc.
An example of a tuple:
# at, v, -, n, place_close, at%p%5 The constraints specified in a tuple can be com-
bined together using logical operators such as
‘and’, ‘or’, ‘negation’. So, for a single rule, multi-

ple constraints can be introduced. For a sense, if
needed, complex constraints can be introduced
which must be satisfied.
#for, v, L2:for.dat &amp;&amp; aspect:continuous, n, time,

</bodyText>

(8) He has been playing for years.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.96562712">
‘vaha kaii saalo se khela rahaa hai ’
‘He’ ‘many’ ‘years’ ‘for’ ‘play’ ‘cont.’ ‘is’
The above rule (for the Hindi translation) has
two constraints for the modified (which is a verb in
this case), the two constraints have been combined
using an ‘and’ operator (represented using two
ampersands, ‘&amp;&amp;’). Only if the two constraints are
satisfied, the constraint is considered as satisfied
else it is considered as failed. The use of different
logical operator gives a lot of expressive power to
a single rule. Sometimes it might be desirable to
place multiple constraints together, because for a
given sense these constraints always occur together,
and by listing them as separate rules we will miss
out the fact that they co-occur.
It is not always necessary (or possible) to fill the
constraint fields. In fact, sometimes it is even de-
sirable to leave them unspecified. In such a case
we place a hyphen in that field, such as the follow-
ing rule;
# at, v, -, n, place_close, at%p%5
In the above rule, the constraint for the modified
field is unspecified. There are also cases when it is
not desirable to have a translated preposition corre-
sponding to its source;
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.5028095">

(9) He went to Delhi.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.992242625">
‘vaha dilli gayaa’ (in hnd)
‘He’ ‘Delhi’ ‘went’
The ‘ZZ’ in the above rule signifies that the
translated sentence will have no preposition corre-
sponding to the preposition ‘to’ when it occurs
with certain verbs which are specified by
“L:verbs.txt” (‘verbs.txt’ is a list of verbs). For the
above Hindi sentence post-position ‘ko’ can

perhaps be introduced, i.e. ‘vaha dilli ko gayaa’,
but ‘vaha dilli gayaa’ is more natural, and the
translated sentence is better off without a ‘ko’.
Finally, each preposition handled has a default
rule, which is applied at the end when all the other
rules for that preposition fail; the sense given by
the default rule is based on the most frequent usage
of the preposition at the target side. All the fields
(except the first and last) in the default rule have
hyphens. The default rule for ‘to’ is written below;

We briefly describe the various steps of the al-

(a) Given a raw sentence we feed it to the
Shakti MT system which performs various
source language analysis, for our algo-
rithm, information such as PP attachment
and correct identification of the phrasal
verb (if present) is crucial.
(b) The output of step (a) is taken by our
module which automatically constructs
the six field tuple described above. At this
point we can only fill some fields, which
are field 1 (source language preposition),
field 2 (modified category) and field 4
(modifier category).

For the current study, experiments were conducted
with 6 high frequency prepositions, they are; at,
for, in, on, to, and with. The algorithm was tested
on 100 sentences for each preposition in both the
language pairs, i.e., 600 sentences for English-
Hindi and 600 sentences for English-Telugu. These
sentences were randomly extracted from the
ERDC3 corpus. The corpus contains text from dif-
ferent domains such as medicine, sports, history,
etc. The input to the implemented system was
manually checked and corrected to make sure that
there were no errors in the information which is
expected by the system. The bulk of these correc-
tions involved rectifying the wrong PP attachment
given by the parser and the mistakes in phrasal
verb identification.

The tables above show the performance of the sys-

BL is the precision of the system with only the de-
fault sense. The tables also show the number of
sense which English prepositions can take on the
target side. Table 1 and Table 2 show English-
Hindi and English-Telugu results respectively.
The implemented system gives very promising
results. Certain prepositions give comparably low
precision. The reasons for the inappropriate sense
selection are discussed in the next section. The
English-Telugu results (Table 2) show same
system precision and BL for some preposition (‘in’

less number of sense on the target side and all the

3.2 Error analysis

<bodyText confidence="0.997865666666667">
The errors made by the system were analyzed and
the major reasons for inappropriate sense selection
were;
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.991859">
(a) Noise generated by WordNet,
(b) Special constructions,
(c) Metonymy,
(d) Ambiguous sentences,
(e) Presence of very general constraints.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999941421052632">
The problem of noise generation by WordNet
sometimes leads to surprising and unexpected
sense selection; this is because in WordNet a noun
or verb will have multiple sense, and each of these
senses will have various levels of hypernym syn-
sets, so, while finding various concepts/features
(specified by the rule for a preposition) we need to
look at each one of these senses. We need to do
this because we currently don’t have the sense in-
formation. So, an inappropriate sense might some-
times satisfy the constraint(s) and result in inap-
propriate selection. The solution for this will obvi-
ously be to identify the correct sense of modi-
fier/modified prior to getting its semantic property
from the WordNet.
There are certain constructions in which the
head noun of the PP is a pronoun, which refers
back to a noun. For us this will create a problem, in
such cases we will first need to get the referent
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.988582">
56
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.926807194444444">
noun and then apply the constraints on it, take the
following example;
(10) The rate at which these reactions occur is
known as rate of metabolism.
In the above example, the head noun of the PP
(at which) refers to the noun (rate) on which we
need to apply the constraints. At present the
coreference information is not available to us,
therefore in such cases the algorithm fails to give
the correct output.
The other reason for failure was the ambiguity
of the sentence itself which could be interpreted in
various ways, like the example below;
(11) Andamaan should go to India.
The above sentence can be interpreted (and
translated) in two ways, the hindi translations for
the two interpretation are;
(11a) ‘andamaan indiaa ko jaanaa chahiye’
‘Andamaan’ ‘India’ ‘to’ ‘go’ ‘should’
India should get Andaman.
(11b) ‘andamaan ko indiaa jaanaa chahiye’
‘Andamaan’ ‘to’ ‘India’ ‘visit’ ‘should’
Andaman should visit India.
In (11a) we get the sense that the
possesion/control of ‘Andamaan’ should go to
‘India’, and in (11b) it is ‘Andamaan’ (the
government of ‘Andamaan’) which is going to
‘India’ (the government of India), as in, The United
States should go to UK, also in (11b) we can have
‘Andamaan’ as somebodys’ name, as in, Ram
should go to India. In such cases we failed to get
the appropriate translation of the preposition as it
in turn depends on the correct interpretation of the
whole sentence. Ambiguity of numerals in a
sentence is yet another case which lead to faliure,
like the following example;
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.516913">
(12) At 83, Vajpayee is overweight.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.988567933333333">
In the above sentence, the number 83 can either
mean this persons’ (Vajpayee) age or his weight.
The target side translation takes different
preposition sense for these two interpretation.
Hindi takes para and in Telugu ‘at’ is not-
translated when we treat 83 as weight, and when
treated as age, we get mem and lo/ki in Hindi and
Telugu respectively.
We found that certain prepositions occur in large
number of metonymical usage, like, ‘with’ and
‘at’. The constraints in a rule have been formulated
for the general usage and not the extended usage of
a given word. The example below shows one such
instance;
(13) Great bowlers spend hours after hours at
the nets.
While looking in WordNet for the various
senses of ‘net’ not a single sense matches with the
kind of usage in which ‘net’ is used in the above
sentence.
Certain rules for some of the preposition were
found to be very general, the low performance of
‘for’ and ‘to’ in telugu and hindi respectively are
mainly due to this reason. In general, formulating
rules (English-Hindi) for preposition ‘to’ was very
difficult. This was because ‘to’ can have around 10
senses in Hindi. The rules with very general
constraints tend to satisfy cases where they should
have failed. One has to revisit them and revise
them.

4 Conclusion and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9996973">
In this paper we described an approach to select
the appropriate sense for a preposition from an
English to Indian language MT perspective, we
discussed the issues involved in the task, we ex-
plained the steps to achieve the required task;
which are, semantic and context extraction, and
sense selection. We reported the performance of
the system, and showed that our approach gives
promising results. We also discussed the identified
problems during the error analysis; such as noise
generation by WordNet.
One of the pertinent tasks for the future would
be to come up with a solution to reduce the noise
generated by WordNet. The scope of rule file in
terms of handling more prepositions needs to be
broadened. We would like to extend this work to
handle complex preposition. Finally, we would like
to explore if ML techniques can be combined with
the rule base to exploit the benefits of both the ap-
proaches.

Very few approaches, like (Alam, 2004; SaintDizier and Vazquez, 2001), consider both, the head (modified) and the complement (modifier) information, to decide the sense of the preposition. The modified (or head) is the head of the phrase to which the PP attaches. The modifier (or complement) is the head noun of the PP. The following examples show very clearly why given a preposition we cannot depend only on the modified or the modifier separately, and that we must consider them both to solve the problem. 52 Considering only the modifier (the complement); (4a) He apologized to his mother. ‘to’ gets translated as se in hnd &amp; ki (su</context>

We use the properties of the head and complement of the preposition to select the appropriate sense in the target language. We later show that the results obtained from this approach are promising. 1 Introduction The task of identifying the appropriate sense from some target language (here, Hindi and Telugu) for a given simple preposition in some source language (here, English) is rather complex for an MT system, and noting that most foreign language learners are never able to get a firm hold on prepositions of a new language (Brala, 2000), this should not be surprising. A simple example illustrates the problem: (1a) He bought a shirt with tiny collars. ‘with’ gets translated to vaalii in Hindi (hnd). and as kaligi unna in Telugu (tlg). (1b) He washed a shirt with soap. ‘with’ gets translated to se in hnd. and as to (suffixed to head noun) in tlg. For the above English sentences, if we try to swap the senses of ‘with’ in their corresponding target translation, the resulting sentences either become ill-formed or unfaithful to their English source.

We use the word ‘context’ very loosely. A context for us is a combination of various properties which can be syntactic or lexical, or both; syntactic context can be modifiermodified relation, lexical properties can be morphological information such as TAM (tense, aspect and modality) of a verb, class of the verb (Levin, 1993), category of the lexical item and in some cases the lexical item itself. The semantics of the modifier and the modified are captured using WordNet (Miller, 1990), and certain other resources such as person, place dictionaries, place and time filters (these filters make use of syntactic cues to mark basic time and place), etc. We use WordNet to get the hypernyms of a word. By using this property we can easily get the broader, more general class/concept for a modifier/modified. Although effective and very intuitive, this method has its own problems. We will elaborate these problems in section 3</context>

If the filter’s result is negative we use WordNet. Dictionaries and POS tags are checked for identifying proper names, we use a proper name dictionary as POS taggers tend to have a fixed upper limit especially when it comes to the identification of named entities. In essence, the linguistic resources are used in the following order; (1) Dictionaries, (2) Time &amp; Place filter, (3) WordNet. Preliminary results have shown that certain prepositions occurring in the PP complement of certain verb classes (Levin, 1993) translate to a specific sense in Hindi. For example, preposition ‘at’ in the case of peer verbs always translates to kii tarapha or kii ora in Hindi.
