This papez describes an &amp;quot;intelligent&amp;quot; tutor of
foreign language concepts and skills based upon
state-of-the-art research in Intelligent reaching
Systems and Computational Linguistics.
The tutor is part of a large R&amp;D project in ITS
which resulted in a system (called DART) for the de-
sign and development of intelligent teaching dialo-
gues on PLATO1
and in a program (called ELISA)
for teaching foreign language conjunctions in con-
text. ELISA was able to teach a few conjunctions in
English, Dutch and Italian. The research reported
here extends ELISA to a complete set of conjunctions
in Italian and French.

I. INTRODUCTION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997695666666667">
In the framework of a large research and deve-
lopment project - called DART - concerned with the
construction of an environment for the design of
large scale Intelligent Teaching Systems (ITS), a
prototype ITS - called ELISA - was developed which
teaches words (conjunctions) of a foreign language
in context (Cern i &amp; Breuker, 1980, 1981; Breuker &amp;
Cern, 1982).
The DART system is an authoring environment
based on the formalism of ATNs for the representa-
tion of the procedural part of the teaching dialogue
and on Semantic Networks for the representation of
the conceptual and linguistic structures. The main
achievement of DART was the integration of tradi-
tional Computer Assisted Learning (CAL) facilities
- such as the ones available in the PLATO system -
in an Artificial Intelligence framework, thus offer-

ing authors a friendly environment for a smooth CAL
- ITS transition when they design and develop tea-
ching programs.
ELISA was a testbed of the ideas underlying
the DART project and at the same time a simple, but
operational, &amp;quot;intelligent&amp;quot; foreign language teacher
acting on a small subset of English, Dutch and Ita-
lian conjunctions. The sample dialogues of ELISA
were chosen intentionally to exemplify, in the
clearest way, issues such as the diagnostic of mis-
conceptions in the use of foreign language conjunc-
tions, which were addressed by the research. In
particular, the assumption was made that a very
simple representation of the correct knowledge
needed for using f.l. conjunctions in context would
have been sufficient to model the whole subject
matter as well as the incorrect behaviour of the
student.
Owing to its prototypical and experimental
character, ELISA was not ready for concrete, large
scale experimentation on any pair of the languages
mentioned.
The research described in this report has been
carried out with the concrete goal of making ELISA
a realistic &amp;quot;intelligent&amp;quot; automatic foreign langu-
age teacher. In fact, we wanted to verify whether
the simple representation of the knowledge in a
semantic network was sufficient to represent a com-
plete set of transformations from the first into
the second language and vice versa.
Italian and French were chosen. A complete
contrastive representation of the use of conjunc-
tions in meaningful contexts was produced.
The set of these unambiguous, meaningful con-
texts - about 600 - defines the use of the conjunc-
tions - about 40 for each language. Their correct
use can be classified according to 60 distinguishing
&amp;quot;concepts&amp;quot; which provide for all potential transla-
tions.
The classification was done on an empirical
ground and is not based on any linguistic rule or
theory. This was actually a contrastive bottom-up
analysis of the use of conjunctions in Italian and

French.
The specific choice of the teaching material
highlighted many (psycho1linguistic and computa-
tional problems related to the compatibility bet-
ween the design constraints of ELISA on the one
hand and the subtleties of the full use of natural
language fragments in translations on the other.
In particular, the complexity of the full network
of conjunctions, concepts and contexts in the two
languages suggests a large set of possible miscon-
ceptions to be discovered from the (partially) in-
correct behaviour of the students but only the
subset of plausible ones should guide the diagnos-
tic dialogue.
In the following, we briefly present the tea-
ching strategy of ELISA and some examples of dia-
logue in order to introduce the problems referred
above and the solutions we propose.
The full set of data is available in Merger
&amp; Cern i (1983) and a subset of it as well as a
more extended description of this work can be
found in Cern i &amp; Merger (19821. A detailed des-
cription of DART and ELISA is a work in prepara-
tion.
Notice that for the development of this know-
ledge base no other expertise was required than
that of a professional teacher, once the principles
are provided by Al experts. This is a proof of the
potential power of Al representations in education-
al settings and in projects of natural language
translation.
Practically, our program is one of the few
Intelligent Systems available in the field of Fo-
reign Language Teaching and usable on a large scale
for Computer Assisted Learning.

II ELISA : A RATHER INTELLIGENT TUTOR
OF FOREIGN LANGUAGE WORDS

A. The Purpose of ELISA
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994041944444445">
ELISA teaches a student to disambiguate con-
junctions in a foreign language by means of a dia-
logue. The purpose of ELISA&apos;s dialogue is to build
a representation of the student&apos;s behaviour which
coincides with the correct representation of the
knowledge needed to translate words in a foreign
language in context.
ELISA has a student model, which is updated
each time the student answers a question. According
to the classification of the answer, and the phase
of the dialogue, ELISA selects one or more new
questions to be put to the student in order to
achieve its purpose.
The mother and the foreign language can be
associated to the source and the target language
(s.l. and t.1.) respectively, or vice versa: the
system is symmetric.
The main phases of ELISA are Presentation and
Assessment.
B. The Presentation Phase
The presentation phase is traditional. The
teacher constructs an exhaustive set of Question
Types from the subject matter represented in a
knowledge network containing conjunctions and con-
texts in two languages as well as concepts adequa-
tely linked to conjunctions and contexts (see for
instance Figs.1 and 2). These are pairs: conjunc-
tion in the source language/conceptual meaning.
For each conjunction in the s.l. and each concept
possibly associated to it a question type is gene-
rated.
For each question type, a classification of
the conjunctions in the target language may be
constructed. This classification is a partition of
the t.l. conjunctions into three classes, namely
expected right, expected wrong and unexpected
wrong. The Expected Right conjunctions are all t.
1. conjunctions which can be associated to the con-
ceptual meaning of the question type. The Expected
Wrong conjunctions are all t.l. conjunctions which
can be a correct translation of the s.l. conjunc-
tion of the question type, but in a conceptual
meaning different from that of the question type
considered. The remaining conjunctions in the t.l.
are classified as Unexpected Wrong: they do not
have any relation in the knowledge base
with the s.l. conjunction, nor with the concept in
the question type considered.
Notice that &amp;quot;concepts&amp;quot; are defined pragmati-
cally i.e. in terms of the purpose of the represen-
tation which is to teach students to translate cor-
rectly conjunctions in context. This defintion of
concepts is not based on any (psychollinguistic
theory or phenomenon. In fact, we looked for con-
texts which have a one-to-one correspondence with
concepts, so that for each context all the conjunc-
tions associated to its specific conceptual mean-
ing can be valid completions of the sentence, in
both languages.
The question is generated from the question
type by selecting (randomly) a context linked to
the concept of the question type, and inserting the
conjunction of the question type. One of the (equi-
valent) translations of the context into target
language is also presented to the student. The stu-
dent is required to insert the conjunction in the
target language which correctly completes the sen-
tence.
When the student makes an error, the correct-
ion consists simply in informing him/her of the
correct answer(s). This feedback strategy should
have the effect of teaching the student the correct

associations and is similar to that used in most CAL
programs.
In contrast to most CAL programs, in ELISA
questions are generated at execution time from in-
formation stored in the knowledge network. The
classification of answers is computed dynamically
from the knowledge network, it is not a simple lo-
cal pattern matching procedure.

C. The Assessment Phase
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993469142857143">
The purpose of the assessment phase is to ve-
rify the acquisition of knowledge and skills on
the part of the student during the presentation
phase. It includes the diagnosis and remedy of mis-
conceptions.
Questions are generated as in the presentation
phase, but in case of a consistent incorrect answer
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.842861">
- a bug (see for instance Brown &amp; van Lehn, 1980),
- a complete dialogue with the student is performed
in order to test the hypothesis that the bug arises
from a whole set of errors grouped into one or more
misconceptions.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999833258426967">
The procedure operates briefly as follows:
each bug invokes
a. one concept called Source Misconcept which re-
presents the meaning of the context of the
question put to the student (e.g., conditional,
temporal, etc.), and
b. one or more concepts called Target Misconcepts
which represent the possible meanings of the
conjunction used by the student in the answer.
The set of target misconcepts does not include
the source misconcept by definition of the bug.
For each pair of source/target misconcept,
question types are generated and the questions are
in turn put to the student. The selection of ade-
quate question types is done on the basis of the
Possible misconception(s); a more skilled selection
should include constraints about the Plausible (ex-
pected) misconceptions, instead of considering ex-
haustively all the theoretical combinations. This
is a main issue of further empirical research, as
will be remarked later.
During each of these diagnostic dialogues, it
is possible that new bugs, i.e. bugs not related
to the source and target misconcept, are discovered.
When this is the case, these bugs are stored in a
bug stack. Once the original misconception has been
diagnosed and remedied, each bug in the bug stack
triggers (recursively) the same diagnostic proce-
dure.
Again, a more skilled strategy for the order-
ing of bugs to be diagnosed and remedied could be
easily designed, on the basis of empirical evidence
drawn by experiments on student&apos;s behaviour.
Finally, let us discuss in more detail the e-
valuation of the student model as it was built ac-
cording to a diagnostic dialogue. By &amp;quot;student mo-
del&amp;quot;, we mean the set of &amp;quot;misconception matrixes&amp;quot;
each related to the source and a target misconcept,
and related to two or more conjunctions.
As these matrixes may, in principle, present a
large variety of different patterns, and even allow
for variations in their dimensions, it would be a
rather complex task to design a minimal set of ty-
pical erroneous patterns unless some reduction pro-
cedure is applied.
So, we first compress the misconception matri-
xes into &amp;quot;confusion kernels&amp;quot; which are (2x3) matri-
xes, then we compare the kernels with standard
patterns of stereotypical misconceptions. Once the
match is found, the diagnostic phase is considered
ended, and a remedy phase is begun.
The remedy consists in informing the student
of the &amp;quot;nature of the misconception&amp;quot;, i.e. the in-
terpretation of the confusion kernel. This inter-
pretation is possible by applying some (psycho)lin-
guistic criteria. In the following section, some
of these criteria will be outlined in order to ex-
plain the behaviour of ELISA in the examples of
dialogue presented.
In other words, the remedy is not a paraphrase
of the history of the dialogue during the diagnosis,
but an interpretation of the significant aspects of
that dialogue. Although the ELISA project is to be
considered completed, research is currently carried
out in order to design a cognitively grounded theo-
ry of misconceptions occurring in this translation
task. For some preliminary work, see Breuker &amp;
Cern i (1982).
It should be noticed that this is the most de-
licate aspect of this investigation. When ELISA was
in a preliminary phase, and its dialogues were rea-
listic but limited to a &amp;quot;toy&amp;quot; knowledge about the
discriminative use of a few conjunctions, we did
not expect that its extension to &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; knowledge
would have implied such an explosion of possible
right (and wrong) links in the network, thus im-
plying an explosion of possible models of student&apos;s
behaviour. Now, the reduction of the number and
complexity of these possible models requires un-
doubtedly empirical evidence. Currently, ELISA em-
bodies enough intuitions to be considered a mature
experimental tool, but not a complete theory of
behaviour in translation, which will only be possi-
ble after many refinements of the simple theory &apos;
embodied by ELISA according to the experimental
evidence in real educational settings.
After a misconception has been remedied, the
(new) bug stack is examined and each bug triggers a
diagnostic-remedial procedure, possibly suggesting
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.998334777777778">
new bugs and so recursively.
When a (new) bug stack is empty, ELISA checks
if all pairs of source/target misconcept have been
examined, if it was not the case a diagnostic pro-
cedure is called, else the (original) bug is con-
sidered remedied and ELISA formulates once more
the question which received initially the wrong
answer. We expect that now the student will not
fail.

III STEREOTYPICAL PROTOCOLS OF DIALOGUE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.981295979166667">
In this section we will present some examples
of dialogue which may well represent a typical in-
teraction occurring as diagnosis and remedy of a
student&apos;s misconceptions.
A. Conceptual Inversion
The dialogue in Fig. 1 presents a prototype
for a class of misconceptions which may be classi-
fied as &amp;quot;conceptual inversion&amp;quot;, i.e. the model of
the student represents the fact the (s)he distin-
guishes between the source and target misconcept,
but associates each of the two with a conjunction
specific for the other of the two.
In this example, the firs question of ELISA:
El has the type (perche, (II2) )and the expected
right answer is &amp;quot;pourquoi&amp;quot;.
2
(I12) means: &apos;Indirect Interrogation, 2nd type&apos;.
Usually, students know that &amp;quot;pourquoi&amp;quot; is cor-
rect in interrogative clauses, but sometimes they
do not know that an interrogative clause might be
indirect, as is our case. Therefore, the transla-
tion &amp;quot;pourquoi&amp;quot; is discarded, and the alternative
&amp;quot;parce que&amp;quot; preferred. This conjunction is indeed
a correct translation of &amp;quot;perche&amp;quot;, but in (CRY&apos;
contexts. This bug is classified as &amp;quot;expected
wrong&amp;quot; and the diagnostic strategy is entered.
The question E2 of ELISA checks if the student
knows that the translation of &amp;quot;perche&amp;quot; in (CR) con-
texts is &amp;quot;parce que&amp;quot;. If this is the case, it could
be guessed that the student does not know (the use
of) &amp;quot;pourquoi&amp;quot;, or alternatively knows (the use of)
pourquoi but believes &amp;quot;pourquoi&amp;quot; to be correct in
a meaning different from (II2) or (CR), and tran-
slates &amp;quot;perche&amp;quot; with &amp;quot;parce que&amp;quot; irrespective of
the context. This misconception will be described
in more detail in the next subsection.
Instead, the student answers: &amp;quot;pourquoi&amp;quot; which
allows one to draw the following conclusions:
a. the student distinguishes between (II2) and (CR)
contexts, but
b. (s)he binds (II2) with &amp;quot;parce que&amp;quot; and (CR) with
&amp;quot;pourquoi&amp;quot;, which is the reverse of the correct
knowledge about French conjunctions.
We call this misconception Conceptual Inver-
sion, the remedy of ELISA will explain to the stu-
dent this result and give more examples of the use
of these conjunctions as translations of &amp;quot;perche&amp;quot;
in each of the two conceptual meanings.

The second example refers to the dialogue pre-

Fig. 2 A typical dialogue during the diagnosis of
a Direct Translation type of misconception.
An excerpt from the knowledge network re-
lated to the dialogue is also included.
The French &amp;quot;comme&amp;quot;, which is interfering with
the Italian &amp;quot;come&amp;quot;, is not bound in any way to
the concept (SI), but instead can be used correctly
as a translation of &amp;quot;come&amp;quot; in (CP)5 contexts.
This interference can be at the origin of
the misconception consisting of the conviction
that, although (SI) and (CP) contexts are clearly
distinguishable in Italian, also because there is a
specific Italian conjunction &amp;quot;(non) appena&amp;quot; for
(SI), which was not true for the disambiguation of
(II2) and (CR) in the example of Fig. 1, the Ita-
lian student consistently translates &amp;quot;come&amp;quot; with
&amp;quot;comme&amp;quot; irrespective of the context.
The answer to El of type (come, (SI))is Sl:
&amp;quot;comme&amp;quot; which is expected wrong. ELISA puts a ques-
tion E2 of type (non appena, (SI)) which is cor-
rectly answered by S2:&amp;quot;das que&amp;quot;. Finally, ELISA
puts a question E3 of type (come, (CP)) and gets
as answer &amp;quot;comme&amp;quot; which is again correct.
It can be concluded that:
a. it is possible, but not certain, that the student
distinguishes between (SI) and (CP) contexts.
Since &amp;quot;non appena&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;des que&amp;quot; are both unam-
biguously bound to (SI), the answer S2 does not
show that the student recognizes the context
(SI); (s)he might instead associate directly the
conjunction &amp;quot;non appena&amp;quot; with &amp;quot;des que&amp;quot; without
being aware of the conceptual meaning of the
context;
b. the last hypothesis has to be considered con-
firmed by the behaviour of the student shown by
S1 and S3: (s)he binds &amp;quot;come&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;comme&amp;quot; irres-
pective of the contexts, probably because of
the interference between the two conjunctions.
We call this misconception Direct Translation.

IV CONCLUSIONS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999663392156863">
ELISA was a testbed for Intelligent Teaching
Systems in foreign language teaching, designed and
developed in DART on the PLATO system for large
scale use. Its paradigm can be utilized for teach-
ing to translate any word or structure whose mean-
ing depends on the context.
The full knowledge of ELISA concerning Italian
and French conjunctions has been produced and an
analysis has been made of the possible patterns of
wrong behaviour. This analysis has led to the de-
sign of a strategy for the diagnosis of misconcep-
tions underlying the surface mistakes, which has
been (theoretically) tested in simple cases.
Because the real correct knowledge is extreme-
ly complex, and so the possible incorrect one, we
expect to introduce heuristics into our exhaustive
diagnostic strategy once it will be used in an ex-
perimental educational setting.
In particular, three aspects could be the ob-
ject of empirical research on the protocols of in-
teraction with ELISA, nl:
a. the plausibility of the expected misconceptions,
their frequency and the explanations - given by
the students - of the causes of their wrong be-
haviour;
b. the heuristics to be inserted in ELISA in order
to induce the misconception from the diagnostic
dialogue, e.g. taking the history of the whole
teaching dialogue into account;
c. the remedial procedure to be applied once the
misconception has been classified (e.g. a &amp;quot;so-
cratic&amp;quot; method).
Theoretically, ELISA&apos;s Italian-French knowled-
ge network is a contrastive representation of the
use of conjunctions and can be utilized in teaching
independently on the computer program.
A representation of the syntax and the seman-
tics of the contexts for their automatic production
would certainly be the natural extension of ELISA&apos;s
research within a project of automatic translation,
and for a better understanding and explanation of
the student&apos;s misconceptions as well.
Because the &amp;quot;a posteriori&amp;quot; linguistic defini-
tion of the &amp;quot;concepts&amp;quot; in the knowledge network can
be considered an interlingua for the translation of
conjunctions, one could conceive that an extension
of the network of ELISA to more languages, con-
structed pragmatically from the contexts, although
requiring a reorganization of the conceptual struc-
ture of the network, could be of some interest for
any project of multilingual automatic translation.

<abstract confidence="0.992860933333333">This papez describes an &amp;quot;intelligent&amp;quot; tutor of foreign language concepts and skills based upon state-of-the-art research in Intelligent reaching Systems and Computational Linguistics. The tutor is part of a large R&amp;D project in ITS which resulted in a system (called DART) for the design and development of intelligent teaching dialoon and in a program (called ELISA) for teaching foreign language conjunctions in context. ELISA was able to teach a few conjunctions in English, Dutch and Italian. The research reported here extends ELISA to a complete set of conjunctions in Italian and French.</abstract>

ELISA was able to teach a few conjunctions in English, Dutch and Italian. The research reported here extends ELISA to a complete set of conjunctions in Italian and French. I. INTRODUCTION In the framework of a large research and development project - called DART - concerned with the construction of an environment for the design of large scale Intelligent Teaching Systems (ITS), a prototype ITS - called ELISA - was developed which teaches words (conjunctions) of a foreign language in context (Cern i &amp; Breuker, 1980, 1981; Breuker &amp; Cern, 1982). The DART system is an authoring environment based on the formalism of ATNs for the representation of the procedural part of the teaching dialogue and on Semantic Networks for the representation of the conceptual and linguistic structures. The main achievement of DART was the integration of traditional Computer Assisted Learning (CAL) facilities - such as the ones available in the PLATO system - in an Artificial Intelligence framework, thus offer1 The DART system on PLATO is the result of a joint effort of the University of Pisa (I) and the University of Amsterdam (NL) and its property rights</context>
