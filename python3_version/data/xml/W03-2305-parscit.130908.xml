There is a general interest in corpora of
human authored texts as a source for ac-
quiring domain knowledge useful for a
natural language generation (NLG) sys-
tem. It is less clear, however, how this
can be done in a systematic way. We
propose a principled approach towards
acquiring domain knowledge through
corpus analysis and illustrate its appli-
cation in the domain of route descrip-
tions. More specifically, we identify
different types of knowledge needed in
the NLG process and describe a proce-
dure for systematically analyzing a cor-
pus text and for inventorizing these dif-
ferent types of knowledge. We discuss
how these procedures fit into a global
approach to corpus analysis and into the
natural language generation system de-
velopment cycle.

1.1 Knowledge requirements for NLG

<bodyText confidence="0.999773642857143">
The process of automatically generating natural
language text from non-linguistic input data has
been characterized in very general terms by Re-
iter and Dale (2000) as consisting of three major
phases: document planning, micro-planning and
surface realization. The simplest architecture to
realize this model is a pipeline, where each of the
major processes consumes and/or produces an in-
termediate representation: from a non-textual in-
put over a document plan and a text specification
to an output text (see Figure 1). An important ar-
gument for considering three phases (rather than
only a planning and a realization one) is related
to the type of knowledge used in each of these
phases.
Document planning consists of transforming a
set of non-textual input data into a document plan
(i.e. a structured set of messages). At this point
only high-level decisions are being made with re-
spect to the contents of the messages and the text
structure.
At the other end of the overall NLG process, the
surface realization phase receives a detailed text
specification ready to be transformed into a final
textual form.
As Reiter and Dale note, the phase of document
planning — directly related to the non-textual in-
put data — is highly determined by domain specific
knowledge, whereas linguistic realization requires
mostly linguistic knowledge. However, the gap
between the document plan and the text specifica-
tion requires a number of processing steps involv-
ing a combination of linguistic and domain knowl-
edge. These processes are grouped under the term
&apos;micro-planning&apos;.
Hence it appears that the development of an
NLG system, entails the acquisition of domain
specific knowledge, especially to assist the first
two phases of the process.
Reiter et al. (2000) describe a variety of tech-
niques for acquiring knowledge for use in NLG
systems. One specific technique is the analy-

sis of human authored corpora. Reiter and Sri-
pada (2002) note that there is a growing interest
in this technique. They describe issues involved
in interpreting information extracted from a cor-
pus, warn against the exclusive reliance on cor-
pora for knowledge acquisition and argue for us-
ing a good quality corpus rather than a large one.
In this paper we investigate which different types
of domain-specific knowledge are required (2.1),
assuming the general architecture proposed by Re-
iter and Dale. We propose concrete steps towards
analysing a corpus in view of acquiring these types
of knowledge (2.2 and 2.3). Finally we describe
how the acquired knowledge is integrated in the
NLG development cycle (3).

The corpora used in this paper as an illustration be-
long to the domain of route descriptions: textual
explanations of a procedure for reaching a spe-
cific destination from a particular point of depar-
ture. The issues involved in describing a route are
distinct from those concerned with calculating the
path sequence underlying the route. Systems pro-
viding route descriptions on demand via the web
(see for example http://www.whereis.com.au) de-
liver a route description in both cartographic and
textual form. The latter generally consists of a
more or less straightforward mapping of the calcu-
lated route data (paths to follow and turns to take)

to text templates or even to a table, as shown in
the example of Figure 2. In the CORAL project,
we aim at building an NLG system for produc-
ing route descriptions that approximate the nat-
uralness of those produced by humans (see Fig-
ure 3) while using input data available in GIS sys-
tems that calculate the path. Our approach, de-
scribed in more detail in Dale et al.(2003), is dif-
ferent from other route description generation sys-
tems which assume the availability of rich percep-
tual (e.g. (Maaf3, 1995; Raubal and Winter, 2002))
or semantic information (Pattabhiraman and Cer-
cone, 1990; Moulin and Kettani, 1999). An ex-
tensive overview of the field of route description
generation systems may be found in the latter pa-
per.
Quite a few studies of route descriptions are
based on the analysis of a corpus of human gen-
erated directions, often in view of a very specific
aspect of this type of discourse. For instance,
Klein (1982) illustrated his model for local deixis
through examples of route descriptions. Fraczak
et al. (1998) used corpus analysis to determine
which information in a subway route description
is optional or obligatory. Wunderlich and Reinelt
(1982) derived from a corpus of route descriptions
a model of the interlocutors&apos; interactions. Only
Denis (1997) describes a systematic approach to
corpus analysis. His aim is to establish mea-
sures for qualitative variability among route de-
scriptions. His analysis starts from an assumption
of what are essential components in route descrip-
tions. We start from the text, working out what are
the building blocks so that an NLG program can
approximate it. The corpus used as an illustration
in this paper consist of 20 written directions within
the urban road network: 9 subjects were asked to
describe the route from their homes to the univer-
sity to a visitor and to a neighbour, and from the
university to a fixed, known destination.

2 Corpus analysis approach for NLG
2.1 Domain specific knowledge sources
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998698596153846">
Assuming the general NLG architecture proposed
by Reiter and Dale (2000), we now examine which
types of knowledge might be acquired from cor-
pora to support the most domain-sensitive NLG
processes.
Document planning decomposes into a process
of content determination and one of text structur-
ing. These processes use the following domain
specific knowledge sources respectively.
Message types In many NLG systems, mes-
sages are created by instantiating message types
with data received from another application. Thus
the set of possible message types is a knowledge
source for the content determination task. A mes-
sage can generally be characterized as a predicate-
argument structure: the predicate asserts a prop-
erty of an argument or a relationship between ar-
guments and is generally realized as a verb; the ar-
gument(s) consist(s) of the main domain entity/ies
to which the predicate applies. For example, in
our domain, a message might communicate an in-
struction to follow (predicate) a path (argument).
It is not the task of the NLG system to compute
this information but rather to determine what con-
figuration of information is appropriate to be com-
municated as a message.
Text structure patterns The subprocess of
text structuring makes explicit the relationship be-
tween successive messages in a text. Text structure
usually takes the form of a hierarchical structure:
a text is composed of different parts, which in turn
consist of successive messages in a particular dis-
course relationship with each other.
In the micro-planning phase, three knowledge
sources are used in the refinement of a structured
set of messages (the document plan) into a text
specification:
Lexemes for message predicates Lexicaliza-
tion mainly consists in choosing a lexeme to re-
alize each message predicate. Thus, a list of oc-
curring lexemes for each message type predicate
is a knowledge source for this process.
RE types for message arguments While the
message type specifies which arguments to realize
linguistically, the way these domain entities are re-
ferred to is still undecided. A list of types of refer-
ring expressions for each message type argument
constitutes a knowledge source for this process.
Aggregation patterns Finally, human authors
tend to combine several messages to form a sen-
tence. Knowledge about which message can be
aggregated in which syntactic constructs is needed

in order to implement this process.

steps in eliciting the above identified knowledge
sources.

Analysing a corpus starts by identifying the ba-
sic message types occurring in the text. These
are to corpus text analysis what objects are to
domain modelling: key conceptual elements re-
sulting from segmenting a space into manageable
units. Thus the first step in corpus analysis con-
sists in segmenting the text in meaningful units,
the next step will be to classify these units into
message types. These two analysis processes usu-
ally interact, as shown in the procedure described
in Figure 5. In this procedure, a key question is
what counts as a message. A pragmatic approach
is to try to identify the message predicates first (see
procedure in Figure 5) and then to further refine
the obtained message types on the basis of occur-
ring arguments (see procedure in Figure 6). We
will illustrate these procedures with the corpus ex-
tract shown in Figure 4.
A first pass segmentation takes the full stops as
a boundary (5.1). Then, examining each sentence,
we look for re-occurring predicates: what is
being communicated? A quite straightforward
hypothesis is that route descriptions consist of in-
structions (hence our hypothesized segmentation
criterion, 5.2), more specifically to TURN (in a
direction) and to FOLLOW a path. As shown in
Figure 4, quite a few sentences occur in between
instructions, which we can not label as FoLLows
or TURNS (5.3). A refinement of our message
type list is necessary (5.4). Here the analysis of
message arguments (as described in Figure 6)
proves useful. A TURN typically takes a dir as
argument (e.g. &apos;left&apos; in 251-8-2), while a FOLLOW
specifies a path (`Burns Bay Rd&apos; in 251-7-3) (6.1).
However, we notice that both TURNS and FOL-
LOWS can take a point (i.e. location where a path
ends and where a turn is to be taken) as argument
too (6.2b), e.g. &apos;after the second one&apos; in 251-7-2
and &apos;right till the end&apos; in 251-8-1). This leads to
the refinement of the TURN and FOLLOW mes-
sage types into TURN(DIR), TURN(POINT,DIR)

respectively. Moreover, both the point and path
arguments occur in non-instructive clauses,
as elaborations in between instructions (e.g.
251-10 and 251-7-3). After a few iterations,
our analysis results in the following list of
message types: TURN(DIR), TURN(POINT,DIR),
FOLLOW(PATH), FOLLOW(PATH, POINT),
STATE(POINT), STATE(PATH) and the notion of
an instruction remains the syntacti co-sem antic
criterion for determining the message boundary.

fects other decisions along the NLG process (in
our domain the message type selection in the first
place). It is therefore useful to investigate whether
a document typically consists of different parts
and how these can be delimited. A well estab-
lished structure analysis proposed by Wunderlich
and Reinelt (1982) distinguishes among the ini-
tial route, intermediate routes and the final route.
The initial route is defined as the part of the route
that can be seen from the departure point. The fi-
nal route starts where the destination comes within
sight of the route taker. We can delimit these
parts (DEP, INT, ARR) in our corpus on the ba-
sis of message types occurring in these parts of
the route descriptions. For instance, nearly all
departure messages imply some notion of direc-
tion ((TuRN(PoiNT,DIR)), INSTR(POINT)I, FOL-
LOW (PATH ,DIR)).
The relationship between successive interme-
diate route messages is quite specific, consist-
ing mainly of an alternation between FOLLOW
and TURN messages. However, we already men-
tioned that elaborations on point or path argu-
ments may be included to further clarify an ele-
ment deemed important in the navigation process.
These elaborations relate to the instructional mes-
sages as satellites to nuclei according to Rhetorical
Structure Theory (Mann and Thompson, 1988).
&apos;This new message sub-type accounts for a frequently
occurring type of instructions: Leave the house (221-1-1),
which is neither a TURN, nor a FOLLOW instruction, but
rather makes explicit the point of departure in the form of
an instruction.
There may also be sporadically occurring &apos;other&apos;
messages, which don&apos;t follow the just identified
rhetorical relationships. In the case of route de-
scriptions, we noted a number of clauses express-
ing meta information about the route (e.g. 251-
9-1) We categorize also negative instructions as
META (e.g. 251-9-2).
Thus, our corpus analysis revealed as canoni-
cal text structure: three major parts (which se-
lect particular message types) and the relationship
within the middle part consisting of sequences of
nuclei (TURN and FOLLOW messages) with pos-
sible elaborations on arguments (points or paths).
This knowledge can be formalized as a rewrite
grammar.

Once the set of message types are determined

The lexicalization patterns also determine how ar-

2.3.2 Types of referring expressions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999982489361703">
The procedure for inventorizing types of refer-
ring expressions (RE) is similar to the one for lex-
icalization options but now applies to the argu-
ments of messages instead of the predicates (see
Figure 7). In general, the list of arguments iden-
tified as part of the message types are the domain
entities for which an RE strategy is needed. Thus,
in our domain, we inventorized RE types for path,
point and dir entities (7.1).
Next, we need to find out whether some as-
pects of the context in which they appear may
have an impact on the choice of a referring ex-
pression. We call these analysis parameters. Obvi-
ously, the message type is one such parameter. For
instance a deictic reference for a point occurs only
in message type TURN(POINT,DIR). Furthermore,
we noticed that in our corpus, an entity might be
referred to by a single expression (e.g. &apos;Burns
Bay Rd. for path in 251-7-3) or by a combina-
tion of expressions (e.g. &apos;Herring Rd&apos; and &apos;at the
top of a hill&apos; for point in 251-10) (7.2). Analy-
sis shows that points can be referred to through
the name of the intersecting street (point-name),
the type of intersection (point-type, as in &apos;the end&apos;
for a T-junction in 251-8-1), a landmark that oc-
curs at that point (point-lm, as &apos;the uni&apos; in 251-9-
I) or a reference to an earlier mention of that point
(point-deictic, as &apos;the second one&apos; in 251-7-2). It
has to be noted that people use world and percep-
tual knowledge that is not readily available to the
NLG system, such as about the topology of the
environment Cat the top of a hill&apos; in 251-10). We
have grouped REs for which the underlying infor-
mation is not available under the common denom-
inator descriptive (7.3).
An inventory of the RE types for point shows
that mentioning the type of intersection is the only
type of RE that occurs across all message types
and that it is the most or second most frequently
used expression in each message type. It is fol-
lowed closely (in frequency) by the use of the
name of the intersecting street. In contrast to many
route descriptions studies (e.g. (Denis, 1997)),
which emphasize the importance of landmarks,
these don&apos;t occur more frequently than the previ-
ous types. However, given that they are often used
as a single RE, it is still an important RE type.

bination of messages in sentences and the analy-
sis parameters that might affect their occurrence.
Following Reiter and Dale (2000), we distinguish
among simple conjunctions (type 1), aggregation
with shared constituents or structure (type 2) and
syntactic embedding (type 3). Aggregation type 2
occurs only rarely in our corpus. Not surprisingly,
since instructive sentences, have no linguistically
realized subject (to share). Also the object of a
FOLLOW and a TURN message are, by definition,
different. Examples of the other two patterns of
aggregation do occur frequently: 251-7-1/3 exem-
plifies the coordination of three messages in one
sentence (type 1) and 251-8-1/2 illustrates how a
TURN message is syntactically embedded in the
preceding FOLLOW message. Furthermore, we la-
belled the messages which are realized by one sen-
tence (or more) as type 0.
Since we are interested in finding out how mes-
sages are combined into sentences, the message
type is an obvious analysis parameter, but also the
position in the sentence (does this message occur
in the first or second position in a conjunction or
as main or subordinate clause in the syntactic em-
bedding?). Table 2 shows that most messages are
either mapped onto a single sentence (type 0) or
simply coordinated (type 1).
As to the relationship between the aggregation
type and the message type, further analysis of type
1 aggregation shows that a TURN(POINT-DIR)
message is most likely to be coordinated, espe-
cially in first position (27/57). In fact, half of these
coordinated TURN(POINT,DIR) messages (13/25)
are followed by a FOLLOW message. Thus, we
might consider TURN(POINT,DIR) and FOLLOW
(see 251-7-2/3) to be a likely candidate for an ag-

As described so far, the knowledge sources con-
sist of inventories of constructions occurring in the
corpus. They provide a range of choice options
for every step in the generation process. We have
built and NLG system for route descriptions by
combining each of the above knowledge sources
with generic NLG processes. The 6 elicited mes-
sage types (predicates and arguments) constitute
the backbone of our system, lexicalisation is kept
fairly straightforward and we have implemented
an RE strategy for point based on the 4 elicited
RE types (see details in Dale et al. (2003)). Given
input information for a particular route, the sys-
tem realizes the first choice option for each step
in the generation process and, using the mecha-
nism of backtracking, it can realize every possible
combination of choice options. The following two
fragments (for the route presented in Figure 2) il-
lustrate the range of variation resulting from mul-
tiple choice options w.r.t. message type selection
and REG.
Follow Richmond Street for 146m.
Turn right onto Lovell Road.
Follow Lovell Road for 37m. until you
reach North Road.
Turn left.
Follow Richmond Street until you reach
the end.
Turn right. Follow Lovell Road for 37m.
At the roundabout, turn left onto North
Road.
Additional control knowledge is needed to reduce
the number of generated alternatives and to de-
termine which constructs to apply in a given sit-
uation. Elicitation of control knowledge requires
to take into account the context, both linguistic
(which message precedes, follows, in which part
of the text does this message appear?) and non-
linguistic context (i.e. application dependent fea-
tures of the instances which form the arguments of
the messages). This is a multi-dimensional prob-
lem, again highly domain dependent, which is the
object of our on-going work.

<bodyText confidence="0.999993272727273">
As pointed out by Reiter et al.(Reiter et al., 2000),
the evaluation of the knowledge acquisition pro-
cess is very costly and yields only suggestive out-
comes. This holds also for our domain, where the
effectiveness of descriptions depends on many ex-
tra linguistic factors, such as user preferences and
physical properties of the environment. At this
stage in the development, we consider the capabil-
ity of generating a range of possible formulations
(as cited in Section 3), occurring in a corpus of hu-
man generated descriptions to be an important step
towards more natural route descriptions (compare
these with Figure 2 and 3). We plan however small
scale informal evaluations of the system including
control knowledge.
While the examples cited are from one corpus,
the approach has been used in other corpora be-
longing to a different sub-domain: directions for
navigation by foot on two different campuses. In-
terestingly, comparing these analyses with the one
presented here sheds a light on the differences be-
tween these sub-domains and allows us to term
these in concrete figures, e.g. about the distribu-
tion of message types, RE types and aggregation
patterns. Corpus analysis in view of NLG thus
contributes to the understanding of the domain.
More importantly, this work is part of an ongo-
ing endeavour to formalize and clearly distinguish
NLG knowledge that is generic (hence reusable)
from domain specific knowledge which has to be
acquired for every new application domain. A sys-
tematic approach to corpus analysis contributes to
the bottom-up elicitation of these distinctions.

It is less clear, however, how this can be done in a systematic way. We propose a principled approach towards acquiring domain knowledge through corpus analysis and illustrate its application in the domain of route descriptions. More specifically, we identify different types of knowledge needed in the NLG process and describe a procedure for systematically analyzing a corpus text and for inventorizing these different types of knowledge. We discuss how these procedures fit into a global approach to corpus analysis and into the natural language generation system development cycle.</abstract>

In contrast to many route descriptions studies (e.g. (Denis, 1997)), which emphasize the importance of landmarks, these don&apos;t occur more frequently than the previous types.

For instance, nearly all departure messages imply some notion of direction ((TuRN(PoiNT,DIR)), INSTR(POINT)I, FOLLOW (PATH ,DIR)). The relationship between successive intermediate route messages is quite specific, consisting mainly of an alternation between FOLLOW and TURN messages. However, we already mentioned that elaborations on point or path arguments may be included to further clarify an element deemed important in the navigation process. These elaborations relate to the instructional messages as satellites to nuclei according to Rhetorical Structure Theory (Mann and Thompson, 1988). &apos;This new message sub-type accounts for a frequently occurring type of instructions: Leave the house (221-1-1), which is neither a TURN, nor a FOLLOW instruction, but rather makes explicit the point of departure in the form of an instruction. There may also be sporadically occurring &apos;other&apos; messages, which don&apos;t follow the just identified rhetorical relationships. In the case of route descriptions, we noted a number of clauses expressing meta information about the route (e.g. 251- 9-1) We categorize also negative instructions as META (e.g. 251-9-2).

More specifically, we identify different types of knowledge needed in the NLG process and describe a procedure for systematically analyzing a corpus text and for inventorizing these different types of knowledge. We discuss how these procedures fit into a global approach to corpus analysis and into the natural language generation system development cycle. 1 Introduction 1.1 Knowledge requirements for NLG The process of automatically generating natural language text from non-linguistic input data has been characterized in very general terms by Reiter and Dale (2000) as consisting of three major phases: document planning, micro-planning and surface realization. The simplest architecture to realize this model is a pipeline, where each of the major processes consumes and/or produces an intermediate representation: from a non-textual input over a document plan and a text specification to an output text (see Figure 1). An important argument for considering three phases (rather than only a planning and a realization one) is related to the type of knowledge used in each of these phases. Document planning consists of transforming a set of non-textual input data </context>
<context position="2878" citStr="Reiter and Dale, 2000" startWordPosition="454" endWordPosition="457">stic knowledge. However, the gap between the document plan and the text specification requires a number of processing steps involving a combination of linguistic and domain knowledge. These processes are grouped under the term &apos;micro-planning&apos;. Hence it appears that the development of an NLG system, entails the acquisition of domain specific knowledge, especially to assist the first two phases of the process. Reiter et al. (2000) describe a variety of techniques for acquiring knowledge for use in NLG systems. One specific technique is the analy31 Figure 1: General architecture for NLG system (Reiter and Dale, 2000) domain specific linguistic ■ document —&gt; plan —&gt; aggregation Surface realization —&gt; 0 CD Micro planning lexicalization referring expression generation Text planning content determination text structuring text pecification sis of human authored corpora. Reiter and Sripada (2002) note that there is a growing interest in this technique. They describe issues involved in interpreting information extracted from a corpus, warn against the exclusive reliance on corpora for knowledge acquisition and argue for using a good quality corpus rather than a large one. In this paper we investigate which diffe</context>

The corpus used as an illustration in this paper consist of 20 written directions within the urban road network: 9 subjects were asked to describe the route from their homes to the university to a visitor and to a neighbour, and from the university to a fixed, known destination. 2 Corpus analysis approach for NLG 2.1 Domain specific knowledge sources Assuming the general NLG architecture proposed by Reiter and Dale (2000), we now examine which types of knowledge might be acquired from corpora to support the most domain-sensitive NLG processes. Document planning decomposes into a process of content determination and one of text structuring. These processes use the following domain specific knowledge sources respectively. Message types In many NLG systems, messages are created by instantiating message types with data received from another application. Thus the set of possible message types is a knowledge source for the content determination task. A message can generally be characterized as a predicateargument st</context>

Following Reiter and Dale (2000), we distinguish among simple conjunctions (type 1), aggregation with shared constituents or structure (type 2) and syntactic embedding (type 3). Aggregation type 2 occurs only rarely in our corpus. Not surprisingly, since instructive sentences, have no linguistically realized subject (to share). Also the object of a FOLLOW and a TURN message are, by definition, different. Examples of the other two patterns of aggregation do occur frequently: 251-7-1/3 exemplifies the coordination of three messages in one sentence (type 1) and 251-8-1/2 illustrates how a TURN message is syntactically embedded </context>

In this paper we investigate which different types of domain-specific knowledge are required (2.1), assuming the general architecture proposed by Reiter and Dale. We propose concrete steps towards analysing a corpus in view of acquiring these types of knowledge (2.2 and 2.3). Finally we describe how the acquired knowl</context>

(2000)" startWordPosition="422" endWordPosition="425"> the phase of document planning — directly related to the non-textual input data — is highly determined by domain specific knowledge, whereas linguistic realization requires mostly linguistic knowledge. However, the gap between the document plan and the text specification requires a number of processing steps involving a combination of linguistic and domain knowledge. These processes are grouped under the term &apos;micro-planning&apos;. Hence it appears that the development of an NLG system, entails the acquisition of domain specific knowledge, especially to assist the first two phases of the process. Reiter et al. (2000) describe a variety of techniques for acquiring knowledge for use in NLG systems.

Elicitation of control knowledge requires to take into account the context, both linguistic (which message precedes, follows, in which part of the text does this message appear?) and nonlinguistic context (i.e. application dependent features of the instances which form the arguments of the messages). This is a multi-dimensional problem, again highly domain dependent, which is the object of our on-going work. 37 4 Conclusion As pointed out by Reiter et al.(Reiter et al., 2000), the evaluation of the knowledge acquisition process is very costly and yields only suggestive outcomes. This holds also for our domain, where the effectiveness of descriptions depends on many extra linguistic factors, such as user preferences and physical properties of the environment. At this stage in the development, we consider the capability of generating a range of possible formulations (as cited in Section 3), occurring in a corpus of human generated descriptions to be an important step towards more natural route descriptions (compare these with Figure 2 and 3).

An extensive overview of the field of route description generation systems may be found in the latter paper. Quite a few studies of route descriptions are based on the analysis of a corpus of human generated directions, often in view of a very specific aspect of this type of discourse. For instance, Klein (1982) illustrated his model for local deixis through examples of route descriptions. Fraczak et al. (1998) used corpus analysis to determine which information in a subway route description is optional or obligatory. Wunderlich and Reinelt (1982) derived from a corpus of route descriptions a model of the interlocutors&apos; interactions. Only Denis (1997) describes a systematic approach to corpus analysis. His aim is to establish measures for qualitative variability among route descriptions. His analysis starts from an assumption of what are essential components in route descriptions. We start from the text, working out what are the building blocks so that an NLG program can approximate it. The corpus used as an illustration in this paper consist of 20 written directions within the urban road network: 9 subjects were asked to describe the </context>

Figure 4: Extract from our analysed corpus fects other decisions along the NLG process (in our domain the message type selection in the first place). It is therefore useful to investigate whether a document typically consists of different parts and how these can be delimited. A well established structure analysis proposed by Wunderlich and Reinelt (1982) distinguishes among the initial route, intermediate routes and the final route. The initial route is defined as the part of the route that can be seen from the departure point. The final route starts where the destination comes within sight of the route taker. We can delimit these parts (DEP, INT, ARR) in our corpus on the basis of message types occurring in these parts of the route descriptions. For instance, nearly all departure messages imply some notion of direction ((TuRN(PoiNT,DIR)), INSTR(POINT)I, FOLLOW (PATH ,DIR)). The relationship between successive intermediate route messages is q</context>
