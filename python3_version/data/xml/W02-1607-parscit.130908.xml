Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.9998829375">
The most difficult task in machine translation is the elimination of ambiguity in human
languages. A certain word in English as well as Vietnamese often has different meanings
which depend on their syntactical position in the sentence and the actual context. In order to
solve this ambiguation, formerly, people used to resort to many hand-coded rules.
Nevertheless, manually building these rules is a time-consuming and exhausting task. So,
we suggest an automatic method to solve the above-mentioned problem by using
semantically tagged corpus. In this paper, we mainly present building a semantically tagged
bilingual corpus to word sense disambiguation (WSD) in English texts. To assign semantic
tags, we have taken advantage of bilingual texts via word alignments with semantic class
names of LLOCE (Longman Lexicon of Contemporary English). So far, we have built
5,000,000-word bilingual corpus in which 1,000,000 words have been semantically
annotated with the accuracy of 70%. We have evaluated our result of semantic tagging by
comparing with SEMCOR on SUSANNE part of our corpus. This semantically annotated
corpus will be used to extract disambiguation rules automatically by TBL (Transformation-
based Learning) method. These rules will be manually revised before being applied to the
WSD module in the English-to-Vietnamese Translation (EVT) system.

Nowadays more and more people are interested
in word sense disambiguation (WSD). Bilingual
corpora have been exploited in order to train
such WSD system, finding out the rules that can
be applied in Machine Translation (Zinovjeva,
2000). The statistical method based on bilingual
corpus is used to find and link words in bitexts
for English-French, English-Chinese, English-
Japanese, etc. (Isahara, Melamed, 2000).
Regarding the English-Vietnamese bilingual
corpus, however, so far, we haven&apos;t seen any
works yet. In this paper, we present building an
English-Vietnamese bilingual corpus with
semantic tags. This semantically-annotated
coprus will be used to train the WSD module for
our EVT in the future. In this paper, we don&apos;t
concentrate on word alignment or WSD, but we
concentrate on assigning semantic tags to
English and Vietnamese words via their class-
based word-alignments (Dien Dinh, 2002).
Thanks to aligned word-pairs along with their
corresponding semantic classes in LLOCE, we
can find the correct sense of a word and assign it
to an appropriate semantic tag. That is, we take
advantage of manually correct translation of
English and Vietnamese words to disambiguate
word senses in semantic tagging. The rest of this
paper consists of 4 following sections:
- Section 2: Collecting English-Vietnamese
bilingual texts.
- Section 3: Normalizing English-
Vietnamese bilingual corpus.
- Section 4: Annotating bilingual corpus:
assigning semantic tags to word-pairs in
corpus and applying this semantically-
annotated corpus to train the WSD module.
- Section 5: Conclusion and future
improvements.

<bodyText confidence="0.986267205882353">
When chosing this bilingual approach, we have
met many difficulties. Firstly, due to no official
English-Vietnamese bilingual corpus available
up to now, we have had to build them by
ourselves by collecting English-Vietnamese
bilingual texts from selected sources. Secondly,
as most of these sources are not electronic
forms, we must convert them into electronic
form. During the process of electronic
conversion, we have met another drawback.
That is: there is no effective OCR (Optical
Character Recognition) software available for
Vietnamese characters. Compared with English
OCR softwares, Vietnamese OCR one is lower
just because Vietnamese characters have tone
marks (acute, breve, question, tilde, dot below)
and diacritics (hook, caret,..). So, we must
manually input most of Vietnamese texts (low-
quality hardcopies). Only OCR of high-quality
hardcopies has been used and manually revised.
During collecting English-Vietnamese bilingual
texts (figure 1), we choose only following
materials:
- Science or techniques materials.
- Conventional examples in dictionaries.
- Bilingual texts that their translations are
exact (translated by human translator and
published by reputable publishers) and not
too diversified (no &amp;quot;one-to-one&amp;quot;
translation).
So far, we have collected a 5,000,000-word
corpus containing 400,000 sentences (most of
them are texts in science and conventional
fields).

After aligning sentences, we check the spell of
English words and Vietnamese words
automatically. Here, we have met another
drawback in processing the Vietnamese word
segmentation because Vietnamese words
(similar to Chinese words) are not delimited by
spaces (Dien Dinh, 2001). However, our
spelling checker is able to detect non-existent
words in English or Vietnamese only. So, we
must review this corpus manually. In fact,
Vietnamese “word” here is only “tieáng”, which
is equivalent to Vietnamese “spelling word” or
“morpheme” (due to features of isolated
language typology).

4 Annotating bilingual corpus
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999945037037037">
The main section in this paper is to annotate the
semantic labels. To carry out this task, we have
taken advantage of classification of semantic
classes in LLOCE. We considered these class
names as semantic tags and assign them to
English words in source sentences. In this
section, we concentrate on annotating semantic
tags via class-based word alignment in English-
Vietnamese bilingual corpus.
There are many approaches to word
alignment in biligual corpora such as: statistics-
based (Brown, 1993), patern-based mapping
(Melamed I.D. 2000), class-based (Sue Ker J.
and Jason Chang S. 1997), etc. Because our
main focus is semantical tagging, we have
chosen the class-based approach to word
alignment. This approach was firstly suggested
by Sue J.Ker and Jason S. Chang (1997) in word
alignment of English-Chinese bilingual corpus.
However, instead of using LDOCE (Longman
Dictionary Of Contemporary English) for
English and CILIN for Chinese, we use LLOCE
enhanced by Synsets of WordNet for both
English and Vietnamese. Thank to this enhanced
LLOCE (40,000 entries), our class dictionary
enjoys more coverage than the original LLOCE
(only 16,000 entries).

<bodyText confidence="0.999634666666667">
According to a report of EAGLES (1998),
LLOCE is a small size learner style dictionary
largely derived from LDOCE and organized
along semantic principles. A quantitative profile
of the information provided is given in table 2

Semantic classification in LLOCE is articulated
in 3 tiers of increasingly specific concepts
represented as major, group and set codes, e.g.
&lt;MAJOR: A&gt; Life and living things
&lt;GROUP: A50-61&gt; Animals/Mammals
&lt;SET: A53&gt; The cat and similar animals: cat,
leopard, lion, tiger,...
Each entry is associated with a set code, e.g.
&lt;SET: A53&gt; nouns The cat and similar animals
Relations of semantic similarity between codes
not expressed hierarchically are cross-
referenced.
There are 14 major codes, 127 group codes and
2441 set codes. The list of major codes below

4.2 Class-based word-alignment
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998369">
We can see clearly that computers cannot
understand human dictionary, it only can
recognize machine dictionary (called MRD),
leading to a limitation in vocabulary as well as
ambiguity in semantics when we align words
relying on dictionary. So class-based alignment
is a solution supplementing the in-context
translations concept.
In order to get a good result when using
class-based algorithm, words in both English
and Vietnamese have to be classified based on
their senses (Resnik, 1999). And the ways we
use to classify them should be as identical as
possible. So we have chosen words in its classes
corresponding to those in LLOCE. Vietnamese
word-classes are named after the available
names of English ones. These seed lexicons
must have large coverages. So after building
these lexicons, we use some more reliable
thesauri to enrich them.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.4582165" genericHeader="method">
4.2.1 Vietnamese word-class lexicon
construction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9924835">
For the sake of convenience, we call Vietnamese
word-class lexicon “CVDic”. Words in this
lexicon are classified into many groups. Each
group has a unique name called class-code. If
knowing one class-code, we can easily know the
number of words of that word-class and even
what these words are.
Step 1:, translations of one English word in
LLOCE are sequentially inserted in turn to the
corresponding class of CVDic.
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.904191">
Consider ew = English word
vw = Vietnamese word
EC = English class-code
VC = Vietnamese class-code
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.975610155555556">
When looking ew up in LLOCE, we obtain its
synonymous translations : vw1, vw2, vw3, ...
Then vw1, vw2, vw3 ... are added to CVDic as :
VC vw1, vw2, vw3 ...
As a result, each word class of CVDic includes
at least one translation word. Normally, the
number of synonyms in Vietnamese are very
large because the richness in the way of
translation is one of the characteristics of
Vietnamese.
Step 2 :, we increase the coverage of the CVDic
by using the English Vietnamese lexicon. Senses
of one word of this English-Vietnamese lexicon
are organised in synonym groups. For each word
in the right hand side, we find if it appears in
some word-classes of the CVDic, then adding
the whole group of VEDic to that class of
CVDic.
We consider VG as a Vietnamese synonym
group of EVDic :
VGi = { a1,a2, ..., an } (i&gt;0, n&gt;0)
In the Vietnamese-class lexicon, we have :
word-class Cj includes word set VCj = { b1, b2,
..., bm } (j&gt;0,m&gt;0).
Then if (3bk E VCj, 1&lt;k&lt;m I bk = al E VGi,
1&lt;l&lt;n) the class Cj E VCDic will contain the
words of VGi v VCj.
4.2.2 Using WordNet to add synonyms to
English word-class lexicon
As you can see, Wordnet (Miller, 1996) is an
on-line lexical reference system whose design is
inspired by current psycholinguistic theories of
human lexical memory. English nouns, verbs,
and adjectives are organized into synonym sets.
We take advantages of this valuable resource to
add more words to word classes in the English
word-class lexicon, CEDic.
In WordNet, English words are grouped in
Synsets (SN1,SN2,...), this classification model
is much more detailed than the one in LLOCE.
Therefore, if any two Synsets in these Synsets
contain two words which belong to the same
word-class, we add the words of the intersection
of these two Synsets to that word-class. That
means:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.755673">
3 ew1 E SNi, ew2 E SNj  |ew1 E EC, ew2 E EC
=&gt; VewE (SN1 n SN2 ), ewE EC
</equation>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.995915">
4.3 Word alignment algorithm
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999775818181818">
Before describing this algorithm briefly, we
have following conventions:
S stands for English sentence and T stands for
Vietnamese one. We have sentence pair
translated by each other is (S,T), s is the word in
S, t is the word in T which is translated by s in S
in context. DTs is the set of dictionary meanings
for s entry, each meaning is represented by d.
WS = { s }, set of English real words and idioms
presented in S.
WT = { t  |t ET ∧ t E VD }, set of Vietnamese
possible words presented in T.
where : VD is the Vietnamese Dictionary
containing Vietnamese possible words and
phrases.
The problem is how computers can recognise
which t in T will be aligned with which s in S.
Relying on WT, we can solve the case resulting
in the wrong definitions of words in Vietnamese
sentences when we only carry out word segment
relying on VD. Our algorithm is in conformity
with the following steps.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.439255">
4.3.1 Dictionary-based word alignment
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998823">
We mainly calculate the similarity on morpheme
between each word d in DTs with all t in WT
based on formula calculating Dice coefficient
(Dice, 1945) as follows:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.997691">
2 x  |d n t |
Sim(d, t) =
 |d  |+  |t |
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999403875">
where:  |d  |and  |t  |: the number of morphemes
in d and in t.
 |d n t  |: the number of morphemes in
the intersection of d and t.
Next, for each word pair (s, t) obtained from
Descartes product (WS x WT), we calculate the
value of DTSim(s, t) presenting the likelihood of
a connection as follows :
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.837674444444444">
DTSim(s, t) = max Sim(d, t) (2)
Examining a sample on following sentence pair:
S = “The old man goes very fast”
T= “OÂ ng cuï di quaù nhanh”
We will have:
WS = { the, old, man, go, very, fast }
WT = { oâng, oâng cuï, cuï, di, nhanh, quaù }
Suppose that we are examining on “man”,
DT(man) = { ngifôøi, daøn oâng, nam nhi }
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.942455666666667">
So, we have:
DTSim(man, oâng) = max{ Sim(ngifôøi, oâng),
Sim (daøn oâng, oâng), Sim(nam nhi, oâng) }=
max{(2x0)/(1+1),(2x1)/(2+1),(2x0)/(2+1)}
= 0.67
DTSim(man, oâng cuï) = max{ Sim(ngifôøi,oâng
cuï), Sim(daøn oâng,oâng cuï), Sim(nam nhi, oâng
cu)}=max {(2x0)/(1+2),(2x1)/(2+2),(2x0)/(2+2)}
=0.5
Then, we choose candidate translation pairs of
greatest likelihood of connection.
4.3.2 Calculating the correlation between
two classes of two languages
The correlation ratio of class X and class Y can
be measured using the Dice coefficient as
follows:
Where |X|= the total number of the words in X,
|Y|= the total number of the words in Y,

4.3.3 Estimating the likelihood of candidate
translation pairs
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.974696352941176">
A coefficient, presented by Brown (1993)
establishing each connection is a probabilistic
value Pr(s,t), showing translated probability of
each pair (s,t) in (S,T), calculated by product of
dictionary translated probability, t(s  |t), and
dislocated probability of words in sentences, d (i
 |j, l, m). However Sue J. Ker and Jason S.
Chang did not agree with it completely. In their
opinion, it is very difficult to estimate t(s, t) and
d(i, j) exactly for all values of s, t, i, j in the
formula:
Pr(s, t) = t(s, t) x d(i, j) (4)
We have the same opinion with them. We can
create functions based on dictionary, word
concept and position of words in sentences to
limit cases to be examined and computed.
The similar concept of word pair (s, t) function:

ConceptSim(s,t) = maxClassSim(X,Y)

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999125833333333">
Then, combining with DTSim(s, t), we have
four value of t(s, t). We have to combine with
DTSim(s, t) because we are partially basing on
dictionary. Besides, we can solve the case that
there are many words belonging to the same
class in sentences.

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998669185185185">
After annotating the bilingual corpus (mainly
English texts), we will apply TBL method of
Eric Brill (1993) to extract disambiguation
rules based on POS, syntactic and semantics
information around the polysemous
(ambiguous) words.
Firstly, we proceed the initially tagging for
all words (except stopwords) with “naive”
labels (most probable labels of this word).
Secondly, the learner will generate rules that
match the templates showing the format of the
rules.
All possible rules that match the templates
and replace the wrong tags with the correct
ones are generated by the learner. In order to
know whether this tag is correct or not, we
must base on the training corpus (annotated
corpus from section 4). TBL method has rules
under following templates as follows:
If we call semantic label (classification of
LLOCE) X and Y,.., the template will have
following format: “Change X into Y if the Z
condition is met”. The Z condition may be a
word form, or a Part-Of-Speech (POS), or a
syntactic label, or a semantic label. Thus, we
must assign each English word to an
appropriate POS tag by an available POS-
tagger (such as POS-tagger of Eric Brill) and
syntactic label by an available parser (such as :
APP, PCPATR, ...). After annotating
morphological, syntactical and semantic
labels, we will apply the above templates in
which Z condition has one of following
formats:
• The ith -word to the left/right of the
ambiguous word is a certain “word form
W” or a certain symbol.
• The ith -word to the left/right of the
ambiguous word is a certain POS k
(lexical tag).
• The ith -word to the left/right of the
ambiguous word is a syntactical function
(e.g. Subject or Object) of the ambiguous
word (syntactic tags).
• The ith -word to the left/right of the
ambiguous word is a certain semantic
label L.
After using the above templates to extract
transformation rules through training stages,
we must manually revise them. We will
consider these true and reasonable
transformation rules as disambiguation ones
which can be applied in the WSD module of
English-to-Vietnamese MT system.

In this paper , we have presented the building
of semantically annotated bilingual corpus
(based on semantic classes of LLOCE). So far,
we have built an English-Vietnamese bilingual
corpus with 5,000,000 words from selected
sources (in science-techniques and
conventional fields). We have also taken
advantage of corresponding features of
bilingual corpus to semantically annotate for
English (and Vietnamese) words via class-
based word alignment. This class-based
approach has been experimented in our
English-Vietnamese bilingual corpus and
given encouraging results (nearly 70% of
ambiguous words are assigned to correct
semantic labels).
In the next stages, we will use this
annotated corpus as training corpus for WSD
in our EVT with the machine learning method
of Eric Brill (TBL).

<abstract confidence="0.991478736263736">The most difficult task in machine translation is the elimination of ambiguity in human languages. A certain word in English as well as Vietnamese often has different meanings which depend on their syntactical position in the sentence and the actual context. In order to solve this ambiguation, formerly, people used to resort to many hand-coded rules. Nevertheless, manually building these rules is a time-consuming and exhausting task. So, we suggest an automatic method to solve the above-mentioned problem by using semantically tagged corpus. In this paper, we mainly present building a semantically tagged bilingual corpus to word sense disambiguation (WSD) in English texts. To assign semantic tags, we have taken advantage of bilingual texts via word alignments with semantic class names of LLOCE (Longman Lexicon of Contemporary English). So far, we have built 5,000,000-word bilingual corpus in which 1,000,000 words have been semantically annotated with the accuracy of 70%. We have evaluated our result of semantic tagging by comparing with SEMCOR on SUSANNE part of our corpus. This semantically annotated corpus will be used to extract disambiguation rules automatically by TBL (Transformationbased Learning) method. These rules will be manually revised before being applied to the WSD module in the English-to-Vietnamese Translation (EVT) system. Nowadays more and more people are interested in word sense disambiguation (WSD). Bilingual corpora have been exploited in order to train such WSD system, finding out the rules that can be applied in Machine Translation (Zinovjeva, 2000). The statistical method based on bilingual corpus is used to find and link words in bitexts for English-French, English-Chinese, English- Japanese, etc. (Isahara, Melamed, 2000). Regarding the English-Vietnamese bilingual corpus, however, so far, we haven&apos;t seen any works yet. In this paper, we present building an English-Vietnamese bilingual corpus with semantic tags. This semantically-annotated coprus will be used to train the WSD module for our EVT in the future. In this paper, we don&apos;t concentrate on word alignment or WSD, but we concentrate on assigning semantic tags to English and Vietnamese words via their classbased word-alignments (Dien Dinh, 2002). Thanks to aligned word-pairs along with their corresponding semantic classes in LLOCE, we can find the correct sense of a word and assign it to an appropriate semantic tag. That is, we take advantage of manually correct translation of English and Vietnamese words to disambiguate word senses in semantic tagging. The rest of this paper consists of 4 following sections: - Section 2: Collecting English-Vietnamese bilingual texts. Section 3: Normalizing Vietnamese bilingual corpus. - Section 4: Annotating bilingual corpus: assigning semantic tags to word-pairs in corpus and applying this semanticallyannotated corpus to train the WSD module. - Section 5: Conclusion and future improvements. English-Vietnamese bilingual texts When chosing this bilingual approach, we have met many difficulties. Firstly, due to no official English-Vietnamese bilingual corpus available up to now, we have had to build them by ourselves by collecting English-Vietnamese bilingual texts from selected sources. Secondly, as most of these sources are not electronic forms, we must convert them into electronic form. During the process of electronic conversion, we have met another drawback. That is: there is no effective OCR (Optical Character Recognition) software available for Vietnamese characters. Compared with English OCR softwares, Vietnamese OCR one is lower just because Vietnamese characters have tone marks (acute, breve, question, tilde, dot below) and diacritics (hook, caret,..). So, we must manually input most of Vietnamese texts (lowquality hardcopies). Only OCR of high-quality hardcopies has been used and manually revised. During collecting English-Vietnamese bilingual texts (figure 1), we choose only following materials: - Science or techniques materials. - Conventional examples in dictionaries. - Bilingual texts that their translations are exact (translated by human translator and published by reputable publishers) and not too diversified (no translation). So far, we have collected a 5,000,000-word corpus containing 400,000 sentences (most of them are texts in science and conventional fields).</abstract>

Vietnamese translation is performed by English teacher of VNU-HCMC. (2) Vietnamese &amp;quot;word&amp;quot; is a special linguistic unit in Vietnamese language only, which is often called This lexical unit is lower than traditional words but higher than traditional morphemes. 1. An example collected from Vietnamese dictionary English- Vietnamese bilingual corpus However, after the collection, we must convert them into unified forms (normalization) by aligning sentences as follows. 3.1 Sentence-alignment of bilingual corpus During inputting this bilingual corpus, we have aligned sentences manually under the following format: *D02:01323: The announcement of the royal birth was broadcast to the nation. loan baùo ra dôøi cuûa döùa hoaøng toäc daõ thanh treân toaøn *D02:01324: Announcements of births, marriages and deaths appear in some newspapers. thoâng baùo ra dôøi, hoûi, tang hieän treân moät vaøi tôø In which, first characters are reference numbers indicating its sources and the position of sentence in texts. Because most of our bilingual corpus are manually typed, we haven&apos;t used automatic sentential alignment. Automatic sentential alignment (Gale and Church, 1991) will be necessary if we have already had online bilingual texts. . 3.2 Spelling Checker of bilingual corpus After aligning sentences, we check the spell of English words and Vietnamese words automatically. Here, we have met another drawback in processing the Vietnamese word segmentation because Vietnamese words (similar to Chinese words) are not delimited by spaces (Dien Dinh, 2001). However, our spelling checker is able to detect non-existent words in English or Vietnamese only. So, we must review this corpus manually. In fact, “word” here is only which is equivalent to Vietnamese “spelling word” or “morpheme” (due to features of isolated language typology). bilingual corpus The main section in this paper is to annotate the semantic labels. To carry out this task, we have taken advantage of classification of semantic classes in LLOCE. We considered these class names as semantic tags and assign them to English words in source sentences. In this section, we concentrate on annotating semantic tags via class-based word alignment in English- Vietnamese bilingual corpus. There are many approaches to word alignment in biligual corpora such as: statisticsbased (Brown, 1993), patern-based mapping (Melamed I.D. 2000), class-based (Sue Ker J. and Jason Chang S. 1997), etc. Because our main focus is semantical tagging, we have chosen the class-based approach to word alignment. This approach was firstly suggested by Sue J.Ker and Jason S. Chang (1997) in word alignment of English-Chinese bilingual corpus. However, instead of using LDOCE (Longman Dictionary Of Contemporary English) for English and CILIN for Chinese, we use LLOCE enhanced by Synsets of WordNet for both English and Vietnamese. Thank to this enhanced LLOCE (40,000 entries), our class dictionary enjoys more coverage than the original LLOCE (only 16,000 entries). 4.1 Classes in LLOCE According to a report of EAGLES (1998), LLOCE is a small size learner style dictionary largely derived from LDOCE and organized along semantic principles. A quantitative profile of the information provided is given in table 2 below. Table 2. Classes in LLOCE Number of entries 16,000 Number of senses 25,000 Semantic fields Major codes 14 Group codes 127 Set codes 2441 Grammar codes same as LDOCE Selectional restrictions same as LDOCE Domain &amp; register Labels same as LDOCE Semantic classification in LLOCE is articulated in 3 tiers of increasingly specific concepts represented as major, group and set codes, e.g. &lt;MAJOR: A&gt; Life and living things &lt;GROUP: A50-61&gt; Animals/Mammals &lt;SET: A53&gt; The cat and similar animals: cat, leopard, lion, tiger,... Each entry is associated with a set code, e.g. &lt;SET: A53&gt; nouns The cat and similar animals Relations of semantic similarity between codes not expressed hierarchically are crossreferenced. There are 14 major codes, 127 group codes and 2441 set codes. The list of major codes below provides a general idea of the semantic areas covered: 1. &lt;A&gt; Life and living things 2. &lt;B&gt; The body, its functions and welfare 3. &lt;C&gt; People and the family 4. &lt;D&gt; Buildings, houses, the home, clothes, belongings, and personal care 5. &lt;E&gt; Food, drink, and farming 6. &lt;F&gt; Feelings, emotions, attitudes, and sensations 7. &lt;G&gt; Thought and communication, language and grammar 8. &lt;H&gt; Substances, materials, objects, and equipment 9. &lt;I&gt; Arts and crafts, sciences and technology, industry and education 10. &lt;J&gt; Numbers, measurement, money, and commerce 11. &lt;K&gt; Entertainment, sports, and games 12. &lt;L&gt; Space and time 13. &lt;M&gt; Movement, location, travel, and transport 14. &lt;N&gt; General and abstract terms. 4.2 Class-based word-alignment We can see clearly that computers cannot understand human dictionary, it only can recognize machine dictionary (called MRD), leading to a limitation in vocabulary as well as ambiguity in semantics when we align words relying on dictionary. So class-based alignment is a solution supplementing the in-context translations concept. In order to get a good result when using class-based algorithm, words in both English and Vietnamese have to be classified based on their senses (Resnik, 1999). And the ways we use to classify them should be as identical as possible. So we have chosen words in its classes corresponding to those in LLOCE. Vietnamese word-classes are named after the available names of English ones. These seed lexicons must have large coverages. So after building these lexicons, we use some more reliable thesauri to enrich them. word-class lexicon construction For the sake of convenience, we call Vietnamese word-class lexicon “CVDic”. Words in this lexicon are classified into many groups. Each group has a unique name called class-code. If knowing one class-code, we can easily know the number of words of that word-class and even what these words are. translations of one English word in LLOCE are sequentially inserted in turn to the corresponding class of CVDic. Consider ew = English word vw = Vietnamese word EC = English class-code VC = Vietnamese class-code When looking ew up in LLOCE, we obtain its synonymous translations : vw1, vw2, vw3, ... Then vw1, vw2, vw3 ... are added to CVDic as : VC vw1, vw2, vw3 ... As a result, each word class of CVDic includes at least one translation word. Normally, the number of synonyms in Vietnamese are very large because the richness in the way of translation is one of the characteristics of Vietnamese. 2:, we increase the coverage of the CVDic by using the English Vietnamese lexicon. Senses of one word of this English-Vietnamese lexicon are organised in synonym groups. For each word in the right hand side, we find if it appears in some word-classes of the CVDic, then adding the whole group of VEDic to that class of CVDic. We consider VG as a Vietnamese synonym group of EVDic : { ..., } (i&gt;0, n&gt;0) In the Vietnamese-class lexicon, we have : word set { } (j&gt;0,m&gt;0). if the class will contain the of WordNet to add synonyms to English word-class lexicon As you can see, Wordnet (Miller, 1996) is an on-line lexical reference system whose design is inspired by current psycholinguistic theories of human lexical memory. English nouns, verbs, and adjectives are organized into synonym sets. We take advantages of this valuable resource to add more words to word classes in the English word-class lexicon, CEDic. In WordNet, English words are grouped in this classification model is much more detailed than the one in LLOCE. Therefore, if any two Synsets in these Synsets contain two words which belong to the same word-class, we add the words of the intersection of these two Synsets to that word-class. That means: E E  |E E n ), 4.3 Word alignment algorithm Before describing this algorithm briefly, we have following conventions: S stands for English sentence and T stands for Vietnamese one. We have sentence pair translated by each other is (S,T), s is the word in S, t is the word in T which is translated by s in S in context. DTs is the set of dictionary meanings for s entry, each meaning is represented by d. { s }, set of English real words and idioms presented in S. { t  |t }, set of Vietnamese possible words presented in T. where : VD is the Vietnamese Dictionary containing Vietnamese possible words and phrases. The problem is how computers can recognise which t in T will be aligned with which s in S. on we can solve the case resulting in the wrong definitions of words in Vietnamese sentences when we only carry out word segment relying on VD. Our algorithm is in conformity with the following steps. word alignment We mainly calculate the similarity on morpheme each word d in DTs with all t in based on formula calculating Dice coefficient (Dice, 1945) as follows: x  |d | Sim(d, t) =  |d  |+  |t | where:  |d  |and  |t  |: the number of morphemes in d and in t. d  |: the number of morphemes in the intersection of d and t. Next, for each word pair (s, t) obtained from product we calculate the value of DTSim(s, t) presenting the likelihood of a connection as follows : DTSim(s, t) = max Sim(d, t) (2) Examining a sample on following sentence pair: S = “The old man goes very fast” ng di quaù We will have: { the, old, man, go, very, fast } { oâng di, nhanh, quaù Suppose that we are examining on “man”, = { daøn oâng, nam nhi So, we have: = max{ oâng, nhi, }= max{(2x0)/(1+1),(2x1)/(2+1),(2x0)/(2+1)} = 0.67 = max{ oâng,oâng nhi, oâng {(2x0)/(1+2),(2x1)/(2+2),(2x0)/(2+2)} Then, we choose candidate translation pairs of greatest likelihood of connection. the correlation between two classes of two languages The correlation ratio of class X and class Y can be measured using the Dice coefficient as follows: Where |X|= the total number of the words in X, |Y|= the total number of the words in Y, =1,if = 0, otherwise 1, if = 0, otherwise, ALLCONN : a list of initial connections obtained by running above dictionary-based word alignment over the bilingual corpus. the likelihood of candidate translation pairs A coefficient, presented by Brown (1993) establishing each connection is a probabilistic value Pr(s,t), showing translated probability of each pair (s,t) in (S,T), calculated by product of dictionary translated probability, t(s  |t), and dislocated probability of words in sentences, d (i  |j, l, m). However Sue J. Ker and Jason S. Chang did not agree with it completely. In their opinion, it is very difficult to estimate t(s, t) and d(i, j) exactly for all values of s, t, i, j in the formula: Pr(s, t) = t(s, t) x d(i, j) (4) We have the same opinion with them. We can create functions based on dictionary, word concept and position of words in sentences to limit cases to be examined and computed. The similar concept of word pair (s, t) function: ConceptSim(s,t) = maxClassSim(X,Y) Then, combining with DTSim(s, t), we have four value of t(s, t). We have to combine with DTSim(s, t) because we are partially basing on dictionary. Besides, we can solve the case that there are many words belonging to the same class in sentences. a Y To X b , ) ( , ) Y | Y (1) (3) Table 3. Constants in word alignment DTSim(s, t) ConceptSim(s, t) a) t1 b) t2 &lt; h2 c) t3 &lt; h1 d) t4 &lt; h1 &lt; h2 Where h1 and h2 are thresholds chosen via experimental results. 4.4 Result of sense tagging for corpus Because we have made use class-based word alignment as described above, after aligning words in bilingual corpus, we determine the semantic class of each word. For example: according to classification of LLOCE, the word “letter” has 2 meanings, one is “message” (if it belongs to class G155) and one is “alphabet” (if it belongs to class G148). Table 4. Result of sense tagging for “letter” i 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 S I write a letter to my friend T Toâi moät thif cho cuûa toâi j 0 1 2 3 5 7 6 G G G G C 280 190 155 281 40 Similarly, the word “bank” has 3 meanings, one is “money” (if it belongs to class J104), one is “river” (if it belongs to class L99) and one is “line” (if it belongs to J41 class). After aligning words, we have semantic tags as follows: Table 5. Result of word alignment for “bank” i 0 1 2 3 S I enter the bank T Toâi ñi vaøo nhaø baêng j 0 1 2 3 Class G280 M5 J104 In this case, “bank” belongs to J104 class, that is the meaning of “bank” is “money”. 4.5 Evaluation of sense tagging for corpus To evaluate the accuracy of our sense tagging in our corpus, we compare our result with SEMCOR (Shari Landes et. al., 1999) on SUSANNE (Geoffrey Sampson, 1995) part only. We have done manual comparison Table 6. Result of sense tagged corpus Jet planes fly about nine miles high. phi cô phaûn bay cao chiføng chín daëm. i 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 S Jet planes fly about nine miles high T phaûn caùc phi cô bay chiføng chín daëm cao j 2 1 3 4 5 6 4 M181 M180 M28 J4 J68 N305 because there are differences between semantic tags of LLOCE and SEMCOR. The result is: 70% of annotated words are assigned correct sense tags. 4.6 Applying sense tagged corpus for WSD After annotating the bilingual corpus (mainly English texts), we will apply TBL method of Eric Brill (1993) to extract disambiguation rules based on POS, syntactic and semantics information around the polysemous (ambiguous) words. Firstly, we proceed the initially tagging for all words (except stopwords) with “naive” labels (most probable labels of this word). Secondly, the learner will generate rules that match the templates showing the format of the rules. All possible rules that match the templates and replace the wrong tags with the correct ones are generated by the learner. In order to know whether this tag is correct or not, we must base on the training corpus (annotated corpus from section 4). TBL method has rules under following templates as follows: If we call semantic label (classification of LLOCE) X and Y,.., the template will have following format: “Change X into Y if the Z condition is met”. The Z condition may be a word form, or a Part-Of-Speech (POS), or a syntactic label, or a semantic label. Thus, we must assign each English word to an appropriate POS tag by an available POStagger (such as POS-tagger of Eric Brill) and syntactic label by an available parser (such as : APP, PCPATR, ...). After annotating morphological, syntactical and semantic labels, we will apply the above templates in which Z condition has one of following formats: The -word to the left/right of the ambiguous word is a certain “word form W” or a certain symbol. The -word to the left/right of the ambiguous word is a certain POS k (lexical tag). The -word to the left/right of the ambiguous word is a syntactical function (e.g. Subject or Object) of the ambiguous word (syntactic tags). The -word to the left/right of the ambiguous word is a certain semantic label L. After using the above templates to extract transformation rules through training stages, we must manually revise them. We will consider these true and reasonable transformation rules as disambiguation ones which can be applied in the WSD module of English-to-Vietnamese MT system. In this paper , we have presented the building of semantically annotated bilingual corpus (based on semantic classes of LLOCE). So far, we have built an English-Vietnamese bilingual corpus with 5,000,000 words from selected sources (in science-techniques conventional fields). We have also taken advantage of corresponding features of bilingual corpus to semantically annotate for English (and Vietnamese) words via classbased word alignment. This class-based approach has been experimented in our English-Vietnamese bilingual corpus and given encouraging results (nearly 70% of ambiguous words are assigned to correct semantic labels). In the next stages, we will use this annotated corpus as training corpus for WSD in our EVT with the machine learning method of Eric Brill (TBL).</abstract>

There are many approaches to word alignment in biligual corpora such as: statisticsbased (Brown, 1993), patern-based mapping (Melamed I.D. 2000), class-based (Sue Ker J. and Jason Chang S. 1997), etc. Because our main focus is semantical tagging, we have chosen the class-based approach to word alignment. This approach was firstly suggested by Sue J.Ker and Jason S. Chang (1997) in word alignment of English-Chinese bilingual corpus. However, instead of using LDOCE (Longman Dictionary Of Contemporary English) for English and CILIN for Chinese, we use LLOCE enhanced by Synsets of WordNet for both English and Vietnamese.

However Sue J. Ker and Jason S. Chang did not agree with it completely. In their opinion, it is very difficult to estimate t(s, t) and d(i, j) exactly for all values of s, t, i, j in the formula: Pr(s, t) = t(s, t) x d(i, j) (4) We have the same opinion with them.

Here, we have met another drawback in processing the Vietnamese word segmentation because Vietnamese words (similar to Chinese words) are not delimited by spaces (Dien Dinh, 2001). However, our spelling checker is able to detect non-existent words in English or Vietnamese only. So, we must review this corpus manually.

The problem is how computers can recognise which t in T will be aligned with which s in S. Relying on WT, we can solve the case resulting in the wrong definitions of words in Vietnamese sentences when we only carry out word segment relying on VD. Our algorithm is in conformity with the following steps. 4.3.1 Dictionary-based word alignment We mainly calculate the similarity on morpheme between each word d in DTs with all t in WT based on formula calculating Dice coefficient (Dice, 1945) as follows: 2 x |d n t | Sim(d, t) = |d |+ |t | where: |d |and |t |: the number of morphemes in d and in t. |d n t |: the number of morphemes in the intersection of d and t. Next, for each word pair (s, t) obtained from Descartes product (WS x WT), we calculate the value of DTSim(s, t) presenting the likelihood of a connection as follows : DTSim(s, t) = max Sim(d, t) (2) Examining a sample on following sentence pair: S = “The old man goes very fast” T= “OÂ ng cuï di quaù nhanh” We will have: WS = { the, old, man, go, very, fast } WT = { oâng, oâng cuï, cuï, di, nhanh, quaù } Suppose that we a</context>

We consider VG as a Vietnamese synonym group of EVDic : VGi = { a1,a2, ..., an } (i&gt;0, n&gt;0) In the Vietnamese-class lexicon, we have : word-class Cj includes word set VCj = { b1, b2, ..., bm } (j&gt;0,m&gt;0).

English nouns, verbs, and adjectives are organized into synonym sets. We take advantages of this valuable resource to add more words to word classes in the English word-class lexicon, CEDic. In WordNet, English words are grouped in Synsets (SN1,SN2,...), this classification model is much more detailed than the one in LLOCE. Therefore, if any two Synsets in these Synsets contain two words which belong to the same word-class, we add the words of the intersection of these</context>

So class-based alignment is a solution supplementing the in-context translations concept. In order to get a good result when using class-based algorithm, words in both English and Vietnamese have to be classified based on their senses (Resnik, 1999). And the ways we use to classify them should be as identical as possible. So we have chosen words in its classes corresponding to those in LLOCE. Vietnamese word-classes are named after the available names of English ones. These seed lexicons must have large coverages. So after building these lexicons, we use some more reliable thesauri to enrich them. 4.2.1 Vietnamese word-class lexicon construction For the sake of convenience, we call Vietnamese word-class lexicon “CVDic”.
