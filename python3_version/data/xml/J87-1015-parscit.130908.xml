textual remindings and the recall of adages&amp;quot; (p. 27).
These &amp;quot;adages&amp;quot; capture in a neat saying the point of the
story. They are in effect macros representing a particular
goals-events interaction. But it is unclear whether recog-
nition of the appropriate adage (e.g., &amp;quot;Too many cooks
spoil the broth&amp;quot;) triggers the setting up of a pattern of
abstract goals and events against which to match the
events of the story, or vice-versa. If the former, one
wonders how the appropriate adage is picked out in the
first place. If the latter, then the use of adages would
seem to be no more than a gimmick, or more charitably
an initially interesting but quickly tiresome, expository
device. The question of just how the more intricate
details of the stories are to be understood is more press-
ing. On the other hand, as part of a cognitive theory of
story understanding, the idea of relating stories with simi-
lar structures is probably right, though there is also the
important point that stories are only interesting insofar as
they take an unexpected turn, as Dyer correctly notes:
&amp;quot;It is the unusual and unexpected events, including the
mistakes and failures of the characters which often make
a story memorable. By their very nature, such events
cannot be predicted in a top-down manner&amp;quot; (p. 17).
As well as TAUs, the discussion of which continues for
an excessive 75 pages, Dyer introduces the notion of
AFFECTs, which are knowledge structures relating the
emotional reactions of participants. These are important
in indicating which TAU is present, and in answering
questions about the narrative.
The second part of this book concerns the control,
coordination, and interaction of various processes, viz.,
parsing for comprehension, retrieval for question answer-
ing, and memory modification in both. Dyer&apos;s claim is
that these interactions are a key element of the integrated
narrative comprehension system, one of whose features is
the ability to understand and answer questions without
parsing them fully or even completely understanding
them. The system, called BORIS, uses &amp;quot;demons&amp;quot;, a type
of production system similar to, but more general than,
Riesbeck and Schank&apos;s &amp;quot;requests&amp;quot;, which undertake a
wide variety of tasks involving various types of know-
ledge structure. The knowledge structures used by
BORIS are firmly founded in the Yale tradition, a feature
that extends in Part III to the use of &amp;quot;I-links&amp;quot; (goal-plan-
event dependencies not unlike those discussed in
Wilensky&apos;s book), MOPs (interconnectable script-like
structures which will be familiar to followers of the Yale
School), and so on.
The final part of the book, not including a number of
appendices, contains a highly detailed worked example
which will be of great interest to anyone thinking of
simulating the model, and which is of value in that it
brings together and focuses the preceding discussion, as
well as clarifying some peripheral questions, especially
concerning the basic parsing strategies used. The book
ends with a retro- and prospective view of the general
approach, highlighting some of the theoretical discoveries
that arose from the computer implementation, and look-
ing forward to future work in the field.
As mentioned above, Dyer&apos;s book is long and thor-
ough: while this is an advantage for readers who wish to
immerse themselves in the model and get an exhaustive
view of it, for the more casual reader it is a difficult book
to get a lot out of despite the author&apos;s guide to
&amp;quot;skimming&amp;quot;. In some respects it is more overtly relevant
to Computational Linguistics than Wilensky&apos;s book,
especially in being more explicit about formalisms and
fine detail, and in dealing with run-time questions:
Wilensky only really underlines the relationship between
planning and understanding in his final chapter, whereas
the Dyer book makes this more explicit throughout.
Finally, one thing that both books are able to make
quite clear even to the most optimistic reader is that the
whole question of understanding and modelling actors&apos;
motives even in relatively banal stories is extremely
complex, and worthy of all the attention it is given.
