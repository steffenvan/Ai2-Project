Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999949260869565">
The emergence of social media brings
chances, but also challenges, to linguis-
tic analysis. In this paper we investigate
a novel problem of discovering patterns
based on emotion and the association of
moods and affective lexicon usage in bl-
ogosphere, a representative for social me-
dia. We propose the use of normative emo-
tional scores for English words in combi-
nation with a psychological model of emo-
tion measurement and a nonparametric
clustering process for inferring meaning-
ful emotion patterns automatically from
data. Our results on a dataset consisting of
more than 17 million mood-groundtruthed
blogposts have shown interesting evidence
of the emotion patterns automatically dis-
covered that match well with the core-
affect emotion model theorized by psy-
chologists. We then present a method
based on information theory to discover
the association of moods and affective lex-
icon usage in the new media.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999934320754717">
Social media provides communication and inter-
action channels where users can freely participate
in, express their opinions, make their own content,
and interact with other users. Users in this new
media are more comfortable in expressing their
feelings, opinions, and ideas. Thus, the resulting
user-generated content tends to be more subjec-
tive than other written genres, and thus, is more
appealing to be investigated in terms of subjec-
tivity and sentiment analysis. Research in senti-
ment analysis has recently attracted much atten-
tion (Pang and Lee, 2008), but modeling emotion
patterns and studying the affective lexicon used in
social media have received little attention.
Work in sentiment analysis in social media is
often limited to finding the sentiment sign in the
dipole pattern (negative/positive) for given text.
Extensions to this task include the three-class clas-
sification (adding neutral to the polarity) and lo-
cating the value of emotion the text carries across
a spectrum of valence scores. On the other hand,
it is well appreciated by psychologists that sen-
timent has much richer structures than the afore-
mentioned simplified polarity. For example, emo-
tion – a form of expressive sentiment – was sug-
gested by psychologists to be measured in terms
of valence and arousal (Russell, 2009). Thus, we
are motivated to analyze the sentiment in blogo-
sphere in a more fine-grained fashion. In this pa-
per we study the grouping behaviors of the emo-
tion, or emotion patterns, expressed in the blog-
posts. We are inspired to get insights into the ques-
tion of whether these structures can be discovered
directly from data without the cost of involving
human participants as in traditional psychological
studies. Next, we aim to study the relationship be-
tween the data-driven emotion structures discov-
ered and those proposed by psychologists.
Work on the analysis of effects of sentiment on
lexical access is great in a psychology perspective.
However, to our knowledge, limited work exists to
examine the same tasks in social media context.
The contribution in this paper is twofold. To
our understanding, we study a novel problem of
emotion-based pattern discovery in blogosphere.
We provide an initial solution for the matter us-
ing a combination of psychological models, affec-
tive norm scores for English words, a novel feature
representation scheme, and a nonparametric clus-
tering to automatically group moods into mean-
ingful emotion patterns. We believe that we are
the first to consider the matter of data-driven emo-
tion pattern discovery at the scale presented in this

detecting the mood – affective lexicon usage cor-
relation in the new media, and propose a novel use
of a term-goodness criterion to discover this senti-

Much work in sentiment analysis measures the
value of emotion the text convey in a continuum
range of valence (Pang and Lee, 2008). Emo-
tion patterns have often been used in sentiment
analysis limited to this one-dimensional formu-
lation. On the other hand, in psychology, emo-
tions have often been represented in dimensional
and discrete perspectives. In the former, emo-
tion states are conceptualized as combinations of
some factors like valence and arousal. In con-
trast, the latter style argues that each emotion
has a unique coincidence of experience, psychol-
ogy and behavior (Mauss and Robinson, 2009).
Our work utilizes the dimensional representation,
and in particular, the core-affect model (Russell,
2009), which encodes emotion states along the
valence and arousal dimensions. The sentiment
scoring for emotion bearing words is available in
a lexicon known as Affective Norms for English
Words (ANEW) (Bradley and Lang, 1999). Re-
lated work making use of ANEW includes (Dodds
and Danforth, 2009) for estimating happiness lev-
els in three types of data: song lyrics, blogs, and
the State of the Union addresses.
From a psychological perspective, for estimat-
ing mood effects in lexicon decisions, (Chastain et
al., 1995) investigates the influence of moods on
the access of affective words. For learning affect
in blogosphere, (Leshed and Kaye, 2006) utilizes
Support Vector Machines (SVM) to predict moods
for coming blog posts and detect mood synonymy.

3.1 Mood Pattern Detection
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999544">
Livejournal provides a comprehensive set of 132
moods for users to tag their moods when blogging.
The provided moods range diversely in the emo-
tion spectrum but typically are observed to fall into
soft clusters such as happiness (cheerful or grate-
ful) or sadness (discontent or uncomfortable). We
call each cluster of these moods an emotion pat-
tern and aim to detect them in this paper.
We observe that the blogposts tagged with
moods in the same emotion pattern have similar

<bodyText confidence="0.999908722222222">
proportions in the usage of ANEW. For example,
in Figure 1 – a plot of the usage of ANEW hav-
ing arousal in the range of 7.2 – 8.2 in the blog-
posts – we could see that the ANEW usage pat-
terns of happy/cheerful and angry/p*ssed off are
well separated. Anger, enraged, and rage will be
most likely found in the angry/p*ssed off tagged
posts and least likely found in the happy/cheerful
ones. In contrast, the ANEW as romantic or sur-
prised are not commonly used in the posts tagged
with angry/p*ssed off but most popularly used in
the happy/cheerful ones; suggesting that, the sim-
ilarity between ANEW usage patterns can be used
as a basis to study the structure of mood space.
Let us denote by B the corpus of all blogposts
and by M= {sad, happy, ...} the predefined set of
moods (|M |= 132). Each blogpost b E B in
the corpus is labeled with a mood lb E M. De-
note by n the number of ANEW (n = 1034). Let
xm = [xm1 , ..., xmi , ..., xmn ] be the vector repre-
senting the usage of ANEW by the mood m. Thus,
xmi = Eb∈B,lb=m cib, where cib is the counting
of the ANEW i-th occurrence in the blogpost b
tagged with the mood m. The usage vector is nor-
malized so that Eni=1 xmi = 1 for all m E M.
To discover the grouping of the moods based on
the usage vectors we use a nonparametric cluster-
ing algorithm known as Affinity Propagation (AP)
(Frey and Dueck, 2007). AP is desirable here
because it automatically discovers the number of
clusters as well as the cluster exemplars. The al-
gorithm only requires the pairwise similarities be-
tween moods, which we compute based on the Eu-
clidean distances for simplicity.
To map the emotion patterns detected to their
psychological meaning, we proceed to measure

the sentiment scores of those |M |mood words.
In particular, we use ANEW (Bradley and Lang,
1999), which is a set of 1034 sentiment convey-
ing English words. The valence and arousal of
moods are assigned by those of the same words
in the ANEW lexicon. For those moods which are
not in ANEW, their values are assigned by those
of the nearest father words in the mood hierarchi-
cal tree1, where those moods conveying the same
meaning, to some extent, are in the same level of
the tree. Thus, each member of the mood clusters
can be placed onto the a 2D representation along
the valence and arousal dimensions, making it fea-
sible to compare with the core-affect model (Rus-
sell, 2009) theorized by psychologists.

3.2 Mood and ANEW Usage Association
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998821">
To study the statistical strength of an ANEW word
with respect to a particular mood, the information
gain measure (Mitchell, 1997) is adopted. Given
a collection of blog posts B consisting of those
tagged or not tagged with a target class attribute
mood m. The entropy of B relative to this binary
classification is
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.982011">
H(B) = −p⊕ lo92(p⊕) − pe lo92 pe
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999218">
where p⊕ and pe are the proportions of the
posts tagged and not tagged with m respectively.
The entropy of B relative to the binary classifi-
cation given a binary attribute A (e.g. if the word
A present or not) observed is computed as
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.988003">
H(B|A) = |B⊕|
|B |H(B⊕) + |Be |H (Be)
|B|
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.998351875">
where B⊕ is the subset of B for which attribute
A is present in the corpus and Be is the subset of
B for which attribute A is absent in the corpus.
The information gain of an attribute ANEW A in
classifying the collection with respect to the target
class attribute mood m, IG(m, A), is the reduction
in entropy caused by partitioning the examples ac-
cording to the attribute A. Thus,
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.666864">
IG(m, A) = H(B) − H(B|A)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999501833333333">
With respect to a given mood m, those ANEW
having high information gain are considered likely
to be associated with the mood. This measure, also
often considered a term-goodness criterion, out-
performs others in feature selection in text cate-
gorization (Yang and Pedersen, 1997).

follow an affect concept, we place them on the af-
fect circle (Russell, 2009). We learn that nearly
all members in the same patterns express a com-
mon affect concept. Those moods in the patterns
with cheerful, pensive, and rejuvenated as the ex-
emplars are mostly located in the first quarter of
the affect circle (00 – 900), which should contain
moods being high in both pleasure and activation
measures. Meanwhile, many members of the an-
gry and aggravated patterns are found in the sec-
ond quarter (900 – 1800), which roughly means
that those moods express the feeling of sadness in
the high of activation. The patterns with the ex-
emplars nauseated and tired contain a majority of
moods found in the third quarter (1800 – 2700),
which could be representatives for the mood fash-
ion of sadness and deactivation. In addition, the
grateful group could be a representative for moods
which are both low in pleasure and in the degree
of activation (2700 – 3600 of the affect circle).
Thus, the clustering process based on the ANEW
usage could separate moods having similar affect
scores into corresponding segments in the circle
proposed in (Russell, 2009).
To visualize mood patterns that have been de-
tected, we plot these emotion modes on the affect
circle plane in Figure 4. For each pattern, the va-
lence and arousal are computed by averaging of
the values of those moods in the quarter where
most of the members in the pattern are.
To further visualize the similarity of moods,
the ANEW usage vectors are subject to a classi-
cal multidimensional scaling (Borg and Groenen,

Figure 5: Top 100 ANEW words used in the
dataset
in the blogposts tagged with cheerful are more
similar to those in happy ones than those in angry
or p*ssed off ones.
For a given mood, a majority of the ANEW used
in the blog posts tagged with the mood is similar
in the valence with the mood. The occurrence of
some ANEW having valence much different with
the tagging mood, e.g. the ANEW hate in the
posts tagged with cheerful or happy moods, might
be the result of a negation construction used in the
text or of other context.
For a given ANEW, the most likely moods
tagged to the blog posts containing the word are
similar with the word in the affective scores. In
addition, the least likely moods are much differ-
ent with the ANEW in the affect measure. A plot
of top ANEWs used in the blogposts is shown in
Figure 5.
Other than the ANEW conveying abstract con-
cept, e.g. desire or anger, those ANEW expressing
more concrete existence, e.g. terrorist or accident,
might be a good source for learning opinions from
social network towards the things. In the corpus,
the posts containing the ANEW terrorist are most
likely tagged with angry or cynical moods. Also,
the posts containing the ANEW accident are most

5 Conclusion and Future Work

We have investigated the problems of emotion-
based pattern discovery and mood – affective lex-
icon usage correlation detection in blogosphere.
We presented a method for feature representation
based on the affective norms of English scores us-
age. We then presented an unsupervised approach
using Affinity Propagation, a nonparametric clus-
tering algorithm that does not require the number
of clusters a priori, for detecting emotion patterns
in blogosphere. The results are showing that those
automatically discovered patterns match well with
the core-affect model for emotion, which is inde-
pendently formulated in the psychology literature.
In addition, we proposed a novel use of a term-
goodness criterion to discover mood–lexicon cor-
relation in blogosphere, giving hints on predicting
moods based on the affective lexicon usage and
vice versa in the social media. Our results could
also have potential uses in sentiment-aware social
media applications.
Future work will take into account the temporal
dimension to trace changes in mood patterns over
time in blogosphere. Another direction is to inte-
grate negation information to learn more cohesive
association in affect scores between moods and af-
fective words. In addition, a new affective lexicon
could be automatically detected based on learning
correlation of the blog text and the moods tagged.

<abstract confidence="0.999203708333333">The emergence of social media brings chances, but also challenges, to linguistic analysis. In this paper we investigate a novel problem of discovering patterns based on emotion and the association of moods and affective lexicon usage in blogosphere, a representative for social media. We propose the use of normative emotional scores for English words in combination with a psychological model of emotion measurement and a nonparametric clustering process for inferring meaningful emotion patterns automatically from data. Our results on a dataset consisting of more than 17 million mood-groundtruthed blogposts have shown interesting evidence of the emotion patterns automatically discovered that match well with the coreaffect emotion model theorized by psychologists. We then present a method based on information theory to discover the association of moods and affective lexicon usage in the new media.</abstract>

Users in this new media are more comfortable in expressing their feelings, opinions, and ideas. Thus, the resulting user-generated content tends to be more subjective than other written genres, and thus, is more appealing to be investigated in terms of subjectivity and sentiment analysis. Research in sentiment analysis has recently attracted much attention (Pang and Lee, 2008), but modeling emotion patterns and studying the affective lexicon used in social media have received little attention. Work in sentiment analysis in social media is often limited to finding the sentiment sign in the dipole pattern (negative/positive) for given text. Extensions to this task include the three-class classification (adding neutral to the polarity) and locating the value of emotion the text carries across a spectrum of valence scores. On the other hand, it is well appreciated by psychologists that sentiment has much richer structures than the aforementioned simplified polarity. Fo</context>

On the other hand, it is well appreciated by psychologists that sentiment has much richer structures than the aforementioned simplified polarity. For example, emotion – a form of expressive sentiment – was suggested by psychologists to be measured in terms of valence and arousal (Russell, 2009). Thus, we are motivated to analyze the sentiment in blogosphere in a more fine-grained fashion. In this paper we study the grouping behaviors of the emotion, or emotion patterns, expressed in the blogposts. We are inspired to get insights into the question of whether these structures can be discovered directly from data without the cost of involving human participants as in traditional psychological studies. Next, we aim to study the relationship between the data-driven emotion structures discovered and those proposed by psychologists. Work on the analysis of effects of sentiment on lexical a</context>

These journals were posted from May 1, 2001 to April 23, 2005. The ANEW usage vectors of all moods are subjected to a clustering to learn emotion patterns. After running the Affinity Propagation algorithm, 16 patterns of moods are clustered as below (the moods in upper case are the exemplars). 1. CHEERFUL, ecstatic, jubilant, giddy, happy, excited, energetic, bouncy, chipper 2. PENSIVE, d</context>
