<bodyText confidence="0.999671136363636">
Japanese texts frequently suffer from the
homophone errors caused by the KANA-KANJI
conversion needed to input the text. It is critical,
therefore, for Japanese revision support systems
to detect and to correct homophone errors. This
paper proposes a method for detecting and
correcting Japanese homophone errors in
compound nouns. This method can not only detect
Japanese homophone errors in compound nouns,
but also can find the correct candidates for the
detected errors automatically. Finding the correct
candidates is one superiority of this method over
existing methods. The basic idea of this method
is that a compound noun component places some
restrictions on the semantic categories of the
adjoining words. The method accurately
determines that a homophone is misused in a
compound noun if one or both of its neighbors is
not a member of the semantic set defined by the
homophone. Also, the method successfully
indicates the correct candidates for the detected
homophone errors.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999923272727273">
We have been using morphological analysis to develop
REVISE, a revision support system that corrects Japanese
input errors (Ikehara, Yasuda, Shimazaki, and Takagi,
1987; Ohara, Takagi, Hayashi, and Takeishi, 1991).
REVISE can detect and correct various types of errors,
such as character deletion, character insertion and some
grammatical errors, using knowledge bases that describe
the characteristics of each error type (see figure 1).
Homophone errors are one of the error types that can be
detected and corrected in REVISE.
Most Japanese texts are made with Japanese word
processors. As Japanese texts consist of phonograms,
KANA, and ideograms, KANJI, Japanese word processors
always use KANA-KANJI conversion in which KANA
sequences (i.e. readings) input through the key board are
converted into KANA-KANJI sequences. Therefore,
Japanese texts suffer from homophone errors caused by
erroneous KANA-KANJI conversion. A homophone error
occurs when a KANA sequence is converted into the
wrong word which has the same KANA sequence (i.e.
the same reading). Therefore, detecting and correcting
homophone errors is an important topic.

Previous research into detecting homophone errors
with revision support systems used two approaches;
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.715983933333333">
(a) using correct-wrong word pairs (Kuga, 1986),
(b) using KWIC (Key Word In Context) lists (Fulcushima,
Ohtake, Ohyama, and Shutoh, 1986; Suzuki and
Takeda, 1989).
Previous research into correct homophone selection in
KANA-KANJI conversion used the following two
methods;
(c) using collocation of words (Nakano, 1982; Tanaka,
Mizutani, and Yoshida, 1984; Makin° and Kizawa,
1981).
(d) using case frame grammar (Oshima, Abe, Yuura, and
Takeichi, 1986).
Method (a) has a drawback in that only pre-defined wrong
words in correct-wrong word pairs are detected. Method
(b) only indicates which words are in the KWIC list.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99868">
Therefore, method (b) cannot automatically detect if the
word is misused. Method (c) demands the creation of a
huge dictionary which must describe all possible word
collocations. Method (d) can select the correct homophone
by using the semantic restriction between a verb and its
cases based on case frame grammar. It is difficult,
however, to use method (d) for detecting the homophone

errors in compound nouns because it mainly depends on
JOSIII (i.e. Japanese postpositions) which are absent in
compound nouns. Furthermore, it is difficult, if not
impossible, for existing methods, (a)-(d), to correct
homophone errors.
This paper describes a method for detecting and
correcting homophone errors in compound nouns used
in REVISE. The idea underlying this method is that a
compound noun component semantically restricts the
semantic categories of adjoining words. Using semantic
categories reduces dictionary size; moreover, this method
needs no syntactic information such as case frames. Also
described are the experimental results made to certify
the validity of this method.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999434">
It is necessary to use semantic information, such as the
semantic restriction between words in a sentence, to handle
homophone errors. We note that it is difficult, if may not
impossible, to handle all homophone errors uniformly.
For example, within a compound noun, the semantic
restriction is mainly seen between adjacent words. The
case frame semantic restriction encompasses the whole
sentence. Therefore, the discussion of this paper focuses
on the detection and correction of homophone errors in
compound nouns.

errors
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999032">
Tanaka and Yoshida (1987) pointed out that the
collocation of words in compound nouns is restricted
semantically. This means that the existence of compound
noun component &amp;quot;X&amp;quot; semantically restricts the set of
words that can appear next to &amp;quot;X&amp;quot;. In order to describe
this set, we use semantic categories instead of the words
themselves to significantly reduce dictionary size.
Namely, if a word is to be accepted as an immediate
neighbor of &amp;quot;X&amp;quot;, its semantic category must be within
the set defined by &amp;quot;X&amp;quot;.

Figure 2 shows the flow diagram of handling homophone

and error correction. In the error correction process, the
correct candidates for detected homophone errors can be
indicated to the user automatically. The user is responsible
for the final selection of the correct homophone from
among the indicated candidates. Semantic restrictions,
which are used in both processes, are described in a
semantic restriction dictionary using semantic categories.

The compound noun that includes only one homophone,

where wp, w are words that have no homophones. The
set of words with the same reading as h; is
H [ hi, 11,, • • •, hi, h. ).
PS; is the set of semantic categories that can appear
immediately before homophone hi. NS, is the set of
semantic categories that can appear immediately after hi.

the semantic category of wp G PS, and
the semantic category of wn E NS • • • (2)
On the other hand, when hi is the wrong homophone,
semantic categories of wp and wn do not satisfy the
semantic restriction for h1, i.e., from (1) and (2);
the semantic category of wp PSi and/or
the semantic category of wn NS r (3)
Therefore, we can detect homophone errors in compound
nouns based on (2) and (3).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997029">
4.2 Insufficient semantic discrimination
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.96117948">
It is possible that set H contains two or more words
whose PSs and/or NSs overlap, such that the semantic
sets do not yield sufficient discrimination performance.
Namely, several semantic restrictions for words in set H
do not satisfy formula (1), i.e., for the semantic categories
of several words in set H,
PS; n PSi * ,
NS, n Ns, 0, &amp;quot;(4)
j.
In this case, semantic categories which do not belong to
PS, fl PSi or NS; n NSi can also be used for detecting
homophone errors based on (2) and/or (3). The words
with semantic categories belonging to PS, n PSi or NS,
fl NS, however, fail to distinguish h, and hi because
such categories satisfy both semantic restrictions in terms
of h1 and hi.
It is very difficult to construct a semantic category
system that would satisfy formula (1) for all words.
Therefore, in REVISE, when a word whose semantic
categories belong to PS, n PS, or NS, n NS, adjoin hi
or hi in compound nouns, hi or hi is detected as a
homophone error. This may wrongly indicate correct
homophones as errors but no error will be missed. This
is a basic requirement of any text revision support system
and/or any text proofreading system.

4.3 Correcting homophone errors in
compound nouns
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999986944444445">
The correct homophone in a compound noun should satisfy
the semantic restrictions established by its adjoining
words. The semantic category for the adjoining word of
the homophone error should be included in the sets of
semantic categories that can appear immediately
before/after the correct homophone. Namely, it is the
correct candidates for the detected homophone error that
satisfy formula (2) and that have the same KANA
sequence (i.e. the same reading) as the error. When the
semantic category sets of homophones partially overlap
and the category of the adjoining word falls into the
overlap region, the homophone is detected as erroneous
even if it is correct, as described above in 4.2. In this
case, the detected homophone itself is also indicated as
one of the correct candidates if it satisfies formula (2).
To indicate only candidates which satisfy formula (2)
leads us to a shortened correction process because the
correct homophone will be included in the candidates.

Generally speaking, the performance of an error detection
method can be measured by two indices: the detection
rate indicates the percentage of errors correctly determined
and the misdetection rate indicates the percentage of
correct words that are erroneously detected as errors.
The detection rate is defined as;
the number of errors detected
actual number of
wrong compounds in the sample.
Detection rate —

The misdetection rate is defined as;
Misdetection rate= the number of
homophones misdetected
actual number of
correct compounds in the sample.
The experimental results are shown in table 3. The
detection rate is over 95%. This value is much higher
than the 48.9% rate previously reported (Suzuki and
Takeda, 1989). On the other hand, the misdetection rate
is less than 30%. This value shows that the proposed
method determined that over 70% of the correct
homophones in compound nouns were correct. This means
that the confirmation process can be significantly
shortened because fewer correct compounds are presented
for confirmation. Moreover, in the correction process,
for more than 80% of detected errors, the correct
homophone was a candidate. These results show that
this method can detect and correct homophone errors in
compound nouns successfully.

We analyzed the experimental results and determined
that misdetection is caused by two factors;
(a) imperfect semantic restriction dictionary,
(b) semantic categories that belong to sets that can adjoin
words having the same reading.
The number of compound nouns used to make the semantic
restriction dictionary was different for each word reading.
When the number of compound nouns used to construct
the dictionary is large enough, misdetection caused by
factor (a) will be minimized. Factor (b) can be offset by
optimizing the semantic category system to improve
semantic discrimination. This problem will be researched
in the future.

<bodyText confidence="0.999922125">
This paper has described a method for detecting and
correcting Japanese homophone errors in compound
nouns used in a revision support system for Japanese
texts; REVISE. The underlying concept of this method
is that a compound noun component can restrict the set
of semantic categories of words that can adjoin the
component. The method accurately determines that a
homophone is misused in a compound noun if one or
both of its neighbors is not a member of the set defined
by the homophone. Also, the method successfully
indicates the correct candidates for the detected
homophone errors automatically. Experiments indicate
that the detection rate is over 95% and that the misdetection
rate is less than 30%. These results confirm the validity
of this method in detecting and correcting Japanese
homophone errors in compound nouns.

<abstract confidence="0.998628173913043">Japanese texts frequently suffer from the homophone errors caused by the KANA-KANJI conversion needed to input the text. It is critical, therefore, for Japanese revision support systems to detect and to correct homophone errors. This paper proposes a method for detecting and correcting Japanese homophone errors in compound nouns. This method can not only detect Japanese homophone errors in compound nouns, but also can find the correct candidates for the detected errors automatically. Finding the correct candidates is one superiority of this method over existing methods. The basic idea of this method is that a compound noun component places some restrictions on the semantic categories of the adjoining words. The method accurately determines that a homophone is misused in a compound noun if one or both of its neighbors is not a member of the semantic set defined by the homophone. Also, the method successfully indicates the correct candidates for the detected homophone errors.</abstract>

REVISE can detect and correct various types of errors, such as character deletion, character insertion and some grammatical errors, using knowledge bases that describe the characteristics of each error type (see figure 1). Homophone errors are one of the error types that can be detected and corrected in REVISE. Most Japanese texts are made with Japanese word processors. As Japanese texts consist of phonograms, KANA, and ideograms, KANJI, Japanese word processors always use KANA-KANJI conversion in which KANA sequences (i.e. readings) input through the key board are converted into KANA-KANJI</context>

This means that the confirmation process can be significantly shortened because fewer correct compounds are presented for confirmation.

We note that it is difficult, if may not impossible, to handle all homophone errors uniformly. For example, within a compound noun, the semantic restriction is mainly seen between adjacent words. The case frame semantic restriction encompasses the whole sentence. Therefore, the discussion of this paper focuses on the detection and correction of homophone errors in compound nouns. 4 A method for handling homophone errors Tanaka and Yoshida (1987) pointed out that the collocation of words in compound nouns is restricted semantically. This means that the existence of compound noun component &amp;quot;X&amp;quot; semantically restricts the set of words that can appear next to &amp;quot;X&amp;quot;. In order to describe this set, we use semantic categories instead of the words themselves to significantly reduce dictionary size. Namely, if a word is to be accepted as an immediate neighbor of &amp;quot;X&amp;quot;, its semantic category must be within the set defined by &amp;quot;X&amp;quot;.
