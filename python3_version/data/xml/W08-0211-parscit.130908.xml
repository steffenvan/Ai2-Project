Abstract
1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995436166666667">
NACLO (North American Computational Linguis-
tics Olympiad) is an annual Olympiad-style contest
for high school students, focusing on linguistics,
computational linguistics, and language technolo-
gies.
The goal of NACLO is to increase participation
in these fields by introducing them before students
reach college. Since these subjects are not nor-
mally taught in high school, we do not expect stu-
dents to have any background of these areas before
the contest. The contest consists of self-contained
problems that can be solved with analytical think-
ing, but in the course of solving each problem, the
students learn something about a language, culture,
linguistic phenomenon, or computational tool.
The winners of NACLO are eligible to partici-
pate in the International Linguistics Olympiad as
part of the US team.

1.1 History of the LO and ILO
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999726470588235">
The International Olympiad in Linguistics is one
of twelve international Science Olympiads (the
others include Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry,
Biology, Informatics, Philosophy, Astronomy, Ge-
ography, and Earth Science). It has existed since
2003 and has, so far, been held exclusively in
Europe (Russia, Estonia, Bulgaria, and the Nether-
lands). ILO 2007 took place in Zelenogorsk near
St. Petersburg, Russia whereas ILO 2008 will be in
Slantchev Bryag near Burgas, Bulgaria. ILO 2009
will be held in Poland.
Individual national linguistics Olympiads have
been held in Russia since 1965 (based on an initia-
tive by Andrey Zaliznyak) and in other countries
more recently1. Recently, a collection of problems
from different decades appeared in Russian (Be-
likov et al., 2007).

1.2 Linguistics Contests in the US
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999492714285714">
Thomas Payne pioneered LO-style competitions
in the USA by organizing three consecutive con-
tests for middle and high school students in the
Eugene, Oregon area in 1998-2000. In the course
of publicizing NACLO, we have discovered that
other local linguistics contests have taken place in
Tennessee, San Jose, and New York City.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.996601">
1.3 Origin of NACLO
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999971769230769">
NACLO began with a planning workshop
funded by NSF in September 2006. The attendees
included faculty and graduate students from about
ten universities as well as representatives from
NSF and ACL. Two high school teachers were
present. The workshop opened with presentations
from organizers of other Olympiads and contests in
linguistics and computer programming. In particu-
lar we received excellent advice from Ivan Derz-
hanski, representing the International Linguistics
Olympiad, and Boris Iomdin, representing the
Moscow Olympiad. The remainder of the work-
shop dealt with scheduling the first contest, elect-

</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.991715">
1.4 Pedagogical goals
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999993787878788">
We have two goals in organizing NACLO. We
want to increase broad participation and diversity
in all language-related careers. We want every
student to have a fun and educational experience
and have a positive attitude toward taking linguis-
tics and language technologies courses in college.
However, we also want to conduct a talent search
for the most promising future researchers in our
field. NACLO uses two mechanisms to be sure
that we reach all levels of participation. The first
mechanism is to separate an open round with easier
problems from an invitation-only round with
harder problems. The second mechanism is related
to grading the problems. Forty percent of the score
is for a correct answer and sixty percent is for ex-
plaining the answer. The students who write the
most insightful explanations are the focus of our
talent search.
When publicizing NACLO in high schools we
have been focusing on certain aspects of linguistics
and computer science. With respect to linguistics,
we emphasize that languages have rules and pat-
terns that native speakers are not aware of; that
there are procedures by which these rules and pat-
terns can be discovered in your own language; and
that the same procedures can be used to discover
rules and patterns in languages other than your
own. With respect to computer science the term
computational thinking has been coined (Wing
2006) to refer to those parts of the field that are not
about computers or programming: thinking algo-
rithmically, using abstraction to model a problem,
structuring and reducing a search space, etc.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.9938">
1.5 Organization at the national level
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999874657894737">
NACLO has two co-chairs, currently Lori
Levin, Carnegie Mellon University, and Thomas
Payne, University of Oregon. Dragomir Radev is
the program chair and team coach. Amy Troyani,
a high school teacher with board certification, is
the high school liaison and advisor on making the
contest appropriate and beneficial to high school
students.
NACLO has several committees. James Puste-
jovsky currently chairs the sponsorship committee.
The other committees are currently unchaired, al-
though we would like to thank William Lewis (out-
reach and publicity) and Barbara Di Eugenio
(followup) for chairing them in the first year.
NACLO is not yet registered as a non-profit or-
ganization and does not yet have a constitution.
We would welcome assistance in these areas.
The national level organization provides materi-
als that are used at many local sites. The materials
include a comprehensive web site
(http://www.naclo.cs.cmu.edu), practice
problems, examples of flyers and press releases,
PowerPoint presentations for use in high schools,
as well as contest booklets from previous competi-
tions.
The contest is held on the same day in all loca-
tions (universities and &amp;quot;online&amp;quot; sites as described
below). In 2007 there was a single round with 195
participants. In 2008 there was an open round with
763 participants and an invitation-only round with
115 participants. Grading is done centrally. Each
problem is graded at one location to ensure consis-
tency.
Three national prizes are awarded for first, sec-
ond, and third place. National prizes are also given
for the best solution to each problem. Local hosts
can also award prizes for first, second, and third
place at their sites based on the national scores.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.993179">
1.6 Funding
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999914545454546">
The main national expenses are prizes, planning
meetings, and the trip to the International Linguis-
tics Olympiad (ILO). The trip to the ILO is the
largest expense, including airfare for eight team
members (two teams of four), a coach, and two
chaperones. The national level sponsors are the
National Science Foundation (2007, 2008), Google
(2007, 2008), Cambridge University Press (2007,
2008), and the North American Chapter of the As-
sociation for Computational Linguistics (2007).
The organizers constantly seek additional sponsors.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.996866">
1.7 Publicity before the contest
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999860142857143">
At the national level, NACLO is publicized
through its own web site as well as on LinguistList
and Language Log. From there, word spreads
through personal email and news groups. No press
releases have been picked up by national papers
that we know of. Local level publicity depends on
the organization of local schools and the hosting
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.9997382">
university&apos;s high school outreach programs. In
Pittsburgh, publicity is facilitated by a central mail-
ing list for gifted program coordinators in the city
and county. Some of the other local organizers (in-
cluding James Pustejosvky at Brandeis, Alina
Johnson at the University of Michigan and Barry
Schiffman at Columbia University as well as sev-
eral others) sent mail to literally hundreds of high
schools in their areas. Word of mouth from the
2007 contest also helped reach out to more places.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.988344">
1.8 Registration
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999804166666666">
NSF REU-funded Justin Brown at CMU created
an online registration site for the 2008 contest
which proved very helpful. Without such a site, the
overhead of dealing with close to 1,000 students,
teachers, and other organizers would have been
impossible.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.9985505">
1.9 Participation of graduate and under-
graduate students
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9996058">
Graduate and undergraduate students participate
in many activities including: web site design, vis-
iting high schools, formulating problems, testing
problems, advising on policy decisions, and facili-
tating local competitions.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.886474" genericHeader="introduction">
2 Problem selection
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999809363636364">
We made a difficult decision early on not to re-
quire knowledge of linguistics, programming or
mathematics. Requiring these subjects would have
reduced diversity in our pool of contestants as well
as its overall size. Enrollment in high school pro-
gramming classes has dropped, perhaps because of
a perception that programming jobs are not inter-
esting. NACLO does not require students to know
programming, but by introducing a career option, it
gives them a reason to take programming classes
later.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.996268">
2.1 Problem types
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999678">
The NACLO problem sets include two main
categories of problems: “traditional” and “compu-
tational/formal”. The ILO includes mostly tradi-
tional problems which include translations from
unknown languages, glyph decoding, calendar sys-
tems, kinship systems, mathematical expressions
and counting systems, among others. The other
category deals with linguistic phenomena (often in
English) as well as algorithms and formal analyses
of text.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999777">
2.2 Problem committee
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999566533333333">
A problem committee was formed each year to
work on the creation, pre-testing, and grading of
problems. The members in 2007 included Emily
Bender, John Blatz, Ivan Derzhanski, Jason Eisner,
Eugene Fink, Boris Iomdin, Mahesh Joshi, Anagha
Kulkarni, Will Lewis, Patrick Littell, Ruslan Mit-
kov, Thomas Payne, James Pustejovsky, Roy
Tromble, and Dragomir Radev (chair). In 2008, the
following people were members: Emily Bender,
Eric Breck, Lauren Collister, Eugene Fink, Adam
Hesterberg, Joshua Katz, Stacy Kurnikova, Lori
Levin, Will Lewis, Patrick Littell, David
Mortensen, Barbara Partee, Thomas Payne, James
Pustejovsky, Richard Sproat, Todor Tchervenkov,
and Dragomir Radev (chair).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999681">
2.3 Problem pool
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999949625">
At all times, the problem committee maintains a
pool of problems which are constantly being
evaluated and improved. Professional linguists and
language technologists contribute problems or
problem ideas that reflect cutting-edges issues in
their disciplines. These are edited and tested for
age appropriateness, and the data are thoroughly
checked with independent experts.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.991697">
2.4 Booklets
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9995792">
The three booklets (one for 2007 and two for
2008) were prepared using MS Publisher. Addi-
tionally, booklets with solutions were prepared in
MS Word. All of these are available from the
NACLO web site.

This is the list of problems for NACLO 2007 (8
problems) and 2008 (12 problems). They can be
divided into two categories: traditional (2007: C,
D, G and 2008: A, C, D, E, G, J, K) and for-
mal/computational (2007: A, B, E, F, H and 2008:
B, F, H, I, L). The traditional problems addressed
topics such as phonology, writing systems, calen-
dar systems, and cognates, among others. The
other category included problems on stemming,

3 Contest administration
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.889649">
NACLO is run in a highly distributed fashion and
involves a large number of sites across the USA in
Canada.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999538">
3.1 Local administration
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999976648648649">
NACLO is held at hosting universities and also
&amp;quot;online&amp;quot;. The online category includes students
who cannot get to one of the hosting universities,
but instead are monitored by a teacher at a conven-
ient location, usually the student&apos;s high school.
There were three hosting universities (Carnegie-
Mellon, Brandeis, and Cornell) in 2007 and thir-
teen hosting universities (the three above + U.
Michigan, U. Illinois, U. Oregon, Columbia, Mid-
dle Tennessee State, San Jose State, U. Wisconsin,
U. Pennsylvania, U. Ottawa, and U. Toronto) in
2008. Any university in the US or Canada may
host NACLO. Local organizers are responsible for
providing a room for the contest, contacting high
local high schools, and facilitating the contest on
the specified contest date. Local organizers may
decide on the number of participants. The number
of participants at the 2008 sites ranged from a
handful to almost 200 (CMU-Pitt).
Local organizers may choose their level of in-
vestment of time and money. They may spend
only a few hours recruiting participants from one
or two local high schools and may spend a small
amount of money on school visits and copying.
But they may also run large scale operations in-
cluding extensive fundraising and publicity. The
site with the largest local participation, Carnegie
Mellon/University of Pittsburgh, donated adminis-
trative staff time, invested hundreds of volunteer
hours, and raised money for snacks and souvenirs
from local sponsors2. The CMU-Pitt site also hosts
a problem club for faculty and students where
problems are proposed, fleshed out, and tested. At
the University of Oregon, a seminar course was
taught on Language Task Creation (formulation of
problems) for which university students received
academic credit.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998218">
3.2 Remote (“online”) sites
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999074">
We had about 65 such sites in 2008. All local
teachers and other facilitators did an amazing job
following the instructions for administering the
competition and for promptly returning the sub-
missions by email or regular mail.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.993981">
3.3 Clarifications
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999938454545455">
During each of the three competitions, the jury
was online (in some cases for 8 hours in a row) to
provide live clarifications. Each local facilitator
was asked to be online during the contest and relay
to the jury any questions from the students. The
jury then, typically within 10 minutes, either re-
plied “no clarification needed” (the most frequent
reply) or provided an answer which was than
posted online for all facilitators to see. We re-
ceived dozens of clarifications requests at each of
the rounds.

e.g., reducing the number of problems in the first
round or involving some sort of self-selection (e.g.,
asking each potential participant to do a practice
test and obtain a minimal score on it). These op-
tions are suboptimal as they detract from some of
the stated goals of the NACLO and we will not
consider them seriously unless all other options
(e.g., recruiting more graders). have been ex-
hausted.

6.2 Problem diversity
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999785">
We would like to include more problem types,
especially on the computational end of the contest.
This is somewhat of a conflict with the ILO which
includes mostly “traditional” LO problems. One
possibility is to have the first round be more com-
putational whereas the invitational round would be
more aimed at picking the team members for the
ILO by focusing more on traditional problems.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999017">
6.3 Practice problems
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999722125">
We will be looking to recruit a larger pool of
problem writers who can contribute problems of
various levels of difficulty (including very easy
problems and problems based on the state of the art
in research in NLP). We are also looking for vol-
unteers to translate problems from Russian, includ-
ing the recently published collection “Zadachi
Lingvisticheskyh Olimpiad”.

6.4 Other challenges
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999910333333333">
The biggest challenges for the NACLO in both
years were funding and time management.
In 2007, four of the students had to pay for their
own airfare and room and board. At the time of
writing, the budget for 2008 is still not fully cov-
ered. The current approach with regard to sponsor-
ship is not sustainable since NSF cannot fund
recurring events and the companies that we ap-
proached either gave nothing or gave a relatively

small amount compared to the overall annual
budget.
The main organizers of the NACLO each spent
several hundred hours (one of them claims “the
equivalent to 20 ACL program committee chair-
manships”), mostly above and beyond their regular
appointments. For NACLO to scale up and be suc-
cessful in the future, a much wider pool of organ-
izers will be needed.

6.5 Other countries
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998357333333333">
Dominique Estival told us recently that an LO
will take place in Australia in Winter 2008 (that is,
Summer 2008 in the Northern Hemisphere). OzLO
(as it is called) will be collaborating with NACLO
on problem sets. Other countries such as the
United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland are
considering contests as well. One advantage that
these countries all have is that they can share (Eng-
lish-language) problem sets with NACLO.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.995755">
6.6 Participant self-selection
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997825166666667">
Some Olympiads provide self-selection prob-
lems. Students who score poorly on these problem
sets are effectively discouraged from participation
in the official contest. If the number of participants
keeps growing, we may need to consider this op-
tion for NACLO.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999045">
6.7 More volunteers
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999914166666667">
NACLO exerted a tremendous toll on the organ-
izers. Thousands of hours of volunteer work went
into the event each year. NACLO desperately
needs more volunteers to help at all levels (prob-
lem writing, local organization, web site mainte-
nance, outreach, grading, etc).

<bodyText confidence="0.999343">
While it will take a long time to properly assess the
impact of NACLO 2007 and 2008, we have some
preliminary observations to share.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.993584">
7.1 Openness
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999980181818182">
We made a very clear effort to reach out to all
high school students in the USA and Canada.
Holding the contest online helped make it truly
within everyone’s reach. Students and teachers
overwhelmingly appreciated the opportunity to
participate at no cost (other than postage to send
the submissions back to the jury) and at their own
schools. Students who participated at the university
sites similarly expressed great satisfaction at the
opportunity to meet with peers who share their in-
terests.

7.2 Diversity and outreach
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999994">
We were pleased to see that the number of male
and female participants was nearly equal. A num-
ber of high schools indicated that clubs in Linguis-
tics were being created or were in the works.

7.3 Success at the ILO

<bodyText confidence="0.990880034482759">
We want to thank everyone who helped turn
NACLO into a successful event. Specifically, Amy
Troyani from Taylor Allderdice High School in
Pittsburgh, Mary Jo Bensasi of CMU, all problem
writers and graders (which include the PC listed
above as well as Rahel Ringger and Julia Work-
man) and all local contest organizers (James Puste-
jovsky, Lillian Lee, Claire Cardie, Mitch Marcus,
Kathy McKeown, Barry Schiffman, Lori Levin,
Catherine Arnott Smith, Richard Sproat, Roxana
Girju, Steve Abney, Sally Thomason, Aleka
Blackwell, Roula Svorou, Thomas Payne, Stan
Szpakowicz, Diana Inkpen, Elaine Gold). James
Pustejovsky was also the sponsorship chair, with
help from Paula Chesley. Ankit Srivastava, Ronnie
Sim and Willie Costello co-wrote some of the
problems with members of the PC. Eugene Fink
helped with the solutions booklets, Justin Brown
worked on the web site, and Adam Hesterberg was
an invaluable member of the team throughout.
Other people who deserve our gratitude include
Cheryl Hickey, Alina Johnson, Patti Kardia, Josh
Cannon, Christina Hunt, Jennifer Wofford, and
Cindy Robinson. Finally, NACLO couldn’t have
happened without the leadership and funding pro-
vided by NSF and Tanya Korelsky in particular as
well as the generous sponsorship from Google,
Cambridge University Press, and the North Ameri-
can Chapter of the ACL (NAACL).

<bodyText confidence="0.98843672972973">
“I think it&apos;s a great outreach tool to high schools. I was es-
pecially impressed by the teachers who came and talked to
[the linguistics professors] about starting a linguistics club”
“The problems are great. One of our undergraduates ex-
pressed interest in a linguistics puzzle contest (on the model of
Google&apos;s and MS&apos;s puzzle contests) at the undergrad level.”
“We got a small but very high-quality group of students.
To get a larger group, we&apos;d need to start earlier.”
“Things could be more streamlined. I think actually *less*
communication, but at key points in the process, would be
more effective.”
“It also would have been nice if there were a camp, like
with the other US olympiads, so that more students would get
the chance to learn about linguistics”
“Just get the word out to as many schools as possible. You
could also advertise on forums like AOPS, Cogito, and even
CollegeConfidential ... where students are looking for intel-
lectual challenges”.
“The problems helped develop the basic code breaking.”
“Having a camp would be a huge benefit, but otherwise I
think the contest was done very well. Thank you for bringing
it to the US.”
“Maybe send a press release to school newspapers and ask
them to print something about it.”
“My 9 students enjoyed participating even though none of
them made it to the second round. Several have indicated that
they want to do it again next year now that they know what it
is like.”
“I used every opportunity to utter the phrase &amp;quot;computa-
tional linguistics&amp;quot; to other administrators, at meetings, with
parents, students, other teachers. People inevitably want to
know more!”
“As I mentioned previously, we are all set to start up a new
math/WL club next year. YAY!”
“Advertise with world language professional organizations
(i.e., ACTFL) and on our ListServs (i.e., FLTeach)”
“It was wonderful. KUDOS!”
“There were several practice sessions, about half run by a
math teacher (who organizes many of the competitions of this
nature) and half by the Spanish teacher. Also, several of the
English teachers got really excited about it (especially the
teacher who teaches AP English Language, who teaches often
about logical reasoning) and offered extra credit to the stu-
dents who took it.”
“The preparation for the naclo was done entirely by the
math club.”
“It was a very useful competition. First, it raised awareness
about linguistics among our students. They knew nothing
about this area before, and now they are looking for opportuni-
ties to study linguistics and some started visiting linguistic
research seminars at the University of Washington.”
“The Olympiad was interesting to most students because it
was very different from all the other math Olympiads we par-
ticipate in. Students saw possibilities for other application of
their general math skills. In addition, the students who won
(reasonably succeeded in) this Olympiad were not the same
students that usually win math contests at our school. This
was very useful for their confidence, and showed everybody
that broadening skills is important.”
“I was the only one to take the contest from my school, so
it didn&apos;t really increase awareness that much. I, however,
learned a lot about linguistics, and the people who I told about
the contest seemed to find it interesting also.”
“As a result of this competition, an Independent-Study
Linguistics Course was offered this spring for a few interested
students.”
“Three students who participated in NACLO are now do-
ing an Independent Study course with my colleague from th
e World Languages dept (who had a linguistics course in
college)”
“I&apos;d like to see more linguistic indoctrination, so that math
nerds are converted over to the good side.”
“next year I will teach a Computational Linguistics semi-
nar”

True story: a major wireless company recently started an advertising

experience fewer dropped calls.

For full credit, your sentences need to be such that the interpretation

the word &amp;quot;fat&amp;quot; changes from an adjective (&amp;quot;fat people&amp;quot;) to a noun (&amp;quot;fat

hearing the second part. What, in your opinion, makes a garden path
sentence harder to process by the hearer?

This 2008 problem was written by Patrick Littell
of the University of Pittsburgh.
The Ilocano language is one of the major languages of the Philippines,
spoken by more than 8 million people. Today is it written in the
Roman alphabet, which was introduced by the Spanish, but before that
Ilocano was written in the Baybayin script. Baybayin (which literally
means “spelling”) was used to write many Philippine languages and
was in use from the 14th to the 19th centuries.

Assign 1/2 point each if the basic symbols (the consonants) are correct,
and the other 1/2 point if the diacritics (the vowels) are correct.
Theoretical: 9 points
* The first step in this problem must be to divide the English items
into semantically similar groups (1 pt) and divide the Baybayin items
into groups based on shared symbols (1 pt).
* From this they can deduce that the group including t�:Y&apos; must
correspond to the “look/appearances” group (4 members each), that
including **3,L to the “skeleton” group (3 members each), and
alb 1Y Pp must be “to buy” (1 each). For getting this far they should
get another 2 points.
* Figuring out the nature of the Baybayin alternations is the tricky
part. A maximally good explanation will discover that there are two
basic processes:
• From the basic form, copy the initial two symbols and add
them to the beginning. The first should retain whatever
diacritic it might have, but the second should have its dia-
critic (if any) replaced by a cross below.
• Insert V1 as the second symbol, and move the initial sym-
bol’s diacritic (if any) to this one. Add an underdot to the
first symbol.
* Discovering these two processes, and determining that the third
process is the result of doing both, is worth 3 points. Discovering
these two processes, and describing the third as an unrelated process –
that is, not figuring out that it’s just a combination of the first two – is
worth 2 points. Figuring out these processes without reference to the
diacritics is worth 1 point, whether or not they correctly determine the
nature of the third process.
* All that remains is to match up which processes indicate which
categories, which shouldn’t be hard if they’ve gotten this far. Their
description of how to determine this is worth another 1 point.
* The remaining 1 point is reserved to distinguish particularly elegant
solutions described with unusual clarity.
