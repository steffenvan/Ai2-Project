Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.98946715">
Assamese is
a morphologically rich, agglutinative and
relatively free word order Indic language.
Although spoken by nearly 30 million
people, very little computational linguistic
work has been done for this language. In
this paper, we present our work on part
of speech (POS) tagging for Assamese
using the well-known Hidden Markov
Model. Since no well-defined suitable
tagset was available, we develop a tagset
of 172 tags in consultation with experts
in linguistics. For successful tagging,
we examine relevant linguistic issues in
Assamese. For unknown words, we
perform simple morphological analysis
to determine probable tags. Using a
manually tagged corpus of about 10000
words for training, we obtain a tagging
accuracy of nearly 87% for test inputs.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999903818181818">
Part of Speech (POS) tagging is the process of
marking up words and punctuation characters in
a text with appropriate POS labels. The problems
faced in POS tagging are many. Many words that
occur in natural language texts are not listed in any
catalog or lexicon. A large percentage of words
also show ambiguity regarding lexical category.
The challenges of our work on POS tagging
for Assamese, an Indo-European language, are
compounded by the fact that very little prior
computational linguistic exists for the language,
though it is a national language of India and
spoken by over 30 million people. Assamese is a
morphologically rich, free word order, inflectional
language. Although POS tagged annotated
corpus for some of the Indian languages such as
Hindi, Bengali, and Telegu (SPSAL, 2007) have
become available lately, a POS tagged corpus for
Assamese was unavailable till we started creating
one for the work presented in this paper. Another
problem was that a clearly defined POS tagset for
Assamese was unavailable to us. As a part of the
work reported in this paper, we have developed
a tagset consisting of 172 tags, using this tagset
we have manually tagged a corpus of about ten
thousand Assamese words.
In the next section we provide a brief relevant
linguistic background of Assamese. Section 3
contains an overview of work on POS tagging.
Section 4 describes our experimental setup. In
Section 5, we analyse the result of our work
and compare the performance with other models.
Section 6 concludes this paper.

2 Linguistic Characteristics of Assamese
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997793125">
In Assamese, secondary forms of words are
formed through three processes: affixation,
derivation and compounding. Affixes play a very
important role in word formation. Affixes are used
in the formation of relational nouns and pronouns,
and in the inflection of verbs with respect to
number, person, tense, aspect and mood. For
example, Table 1 shows how a relational noun
❡❞✄t❆ (deutA: father) is inflected depending on
number and person (Goswami, 2003). Though
Assamese is relatively free word order, yet the
predominant word order is subject-object-verb
(SOV).
The following paragraphs describe just a few
of the many characteristics of Assamese text that
make the tagging task complex.

3 Related Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9959386">
Several approaches have been used for building
POS taggers. Two main approaches are
supervised and unsupervised. Both supervised and
unsupervised tagging can be of three sub-types.
They are rule based, stochastic based and neural
network based. There are number of pros and cons
for each of these methods. The most common
stochastic tagging technique is Hidden Markov
Model (HMM).
During the last two
decades, many different types of taggers have been
developed, especially for corpus rich languages
such as English. Nevertheless, due to relatively
free word order, agglutinative nature, lack of
resources and the general lateness in entering the
computational linguistics field in India, reported
tagger development work on Indian languages
is relatively scanty. Among reported works,
Dandapat (2007) developed a hybrid model of
POS tagging by combining both supervised and
unsupervised stochastic techniques. Avinesh and
Karthik (2007) used conditional random field and
transformation based learning. The heart of the
system developed by Singh et al. (2006) for Hindi
was the detailed linguistic analysis of morpho-
syntactic phenomena, adroit handling of suffixes,
accurate verb group identification and learning
of disambiguation rules. Saha et al. (2004)
developed a system for machine assisted POS
tagging of Bangla corpora. Pammi and Prahllad
(2007) developed a POS tagger and chunker
using Decision Forests. This work explored
different methods for POS tagging of Indian
languages using sub-words as units. Generally,
most POS taggers for Indian langauages use

4 Our Approach
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999733913043478">
We have used a Assamese text corpus (Corpus
Asm) of nearly 300,000 words from the online
version of the Assamese daily Asomiya Pratidin
(Sharma et al., 2008). The downloaded articles
use a font-based encoding called Luit. For
our experiments we transliterate the texts to a
normalised Roman encoding using transliteration
software developed by us. We manually tag a
part of this corpus, Tr, consisting of nearly 10,000
words for training. We use other portions of
Corpus Asm for testing the tagger.
There was no tagset for Assamese before we
started the project reported in this paper. Due to
the morphological richness of the language, many
words of Assamese occur in secondary forms in
texts. This increases the number of POS tags
that needed for the language. Also, often there
are differences of opinion among linguists on the
tags that may be associated with certain words
in texts. We developed a tagset after in-depth
consultation with linguists and manually tagged
text segments of nearly 10,000 words according to
their guidance. To make the tagging process easier
we have subcategorised each category of noun
and personal pronoun based on six case endings
(viz, nominative, accussative, instumental, dative,
genitive and locative) and two numbers.
We have used HMM
(Dermatas and Kokkinakis, 1995) and the Viterbi
algorithm (1967) in developing our POS tagger.
HMM/Viterbi approach is the most useful method,
when pretagged corpus is not available. First, in
the training phase, we have manually tagged the
Tr part of the corpus using the tagset discussed
above. Then, we build four database tables
using probabilities extracted from the manually
tagged corpus- word-probability table, previous-
tag-probability table, starting-tag-probability table
and affix-probability table.
For testing, we consider three text segments, A,
B and C, each of about 1000 words. First the input
text is segmented into sentences. Each sentence
is parsed individually. Each word of a sentence
is stored in an array. After that, each word is
searched in the word-probability table. If the
word is unknown, its possible affixes are extracted

and searched in the affix-probability table. From
this search, we obtain the probable tags and
their corresponding probabilities for each word.
All these probable tags and the corresponding
probabilities are stored in a two dimensional array
which we call the lattice of the sentence. If we
do not get probable tags and probabilities for a
certain word from these two tables we assign tag
CN (Common Noun) and probability 1 to the
word since occurrence of CN is highest in the
manually tagged corpus. After forming the lattice,
the Viterbi algorithm is applied to the lattice that
yields the most probable tag sequence for that
sentence. After that next sentence is taken and the
same procedure is repeated.

5 Experimental Evaluation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99981925">
The results using the three test segments are
summarised in Table 2. The evaluation of the
results require intensive manual verification effort.
Larger training corpora is likely to produce more
accurate results. More reliable results can be
obtained using larger test corpora. Table 3
compares our result with other HMM based
reported work. Form the table it is clear that

Toutanova et al. (2003) obtained the best result
for English (97.24%). Among HMM based
experiments reported on Indian languages, we
have obtained the best result (86.89%). This work
is ongoing and the corpus size and the amount of
tagged text are being increased on a regular basis.
The accuracy of a tagger depends on the size of
tagset used, vocabulary used, and size, genre and
quality of the corpus used. Our tagset containing
172 tags is rather big compared to other Indian
language tagsets. A smaller tagset is likely to
give more accurate result, but may give less
information about word structure and ambiguity.
The corpora for training and testing our tagger are
taken form an Assamese daily newspaper Asomiya
Pratidin, thus they are of the same genre.

6 Conclusion &amp; Future work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999976318181818">
We have achieved good POS tagging results for
Assamese, a fairly widely spoken language which
had very little prior computational linguistic work.
We have obtained an average tagging accuracy
of 87% using a training corpus of just 10000
words. Our main achievement is the creation of
the Assamese tagset that was not available before
starting this project. We have implemented an
existing method for POS tagging but our work is
for a new language where an annotated corpora
and a pre-defined tagset were not available.
We are currently working on developing a
small and more compact tagset. We propose
the following additional work for improved
performance. First, the size of the manually
tagged part of the corpus will have to be
increased. Second, a suitable procedure for
handling unknown proper nouns will have to be
developed. Third, if this system can be expanded
to trigrams or even n-grams using a larger training
corpus, we believe that the tagging accuracy will
increase.

Also, often there are differences of opinion among linguists on the tags that may be associated with certain words in texts. We developed a tagset after in-depth consultation with linguists and manually tagged text segments of nearly 10,000 words according to their guidance. To make the tagging process easier we have subcategorised each category of noun and personal pronoun based on six case endings (viz, nominative, accussative, instumental, dative, genitive and locative) and two numbers. We have used HMM (Dermatas and Kokkinakis, 1995) and the Viterbi algorithm (1967) in developing our POS tagger. HMM/Viterbi approach is the most useful method, when pretagged corpus is not available. First, in the training phase, we have manually tagged the Tr part of the corpus using the tagset discussed above. Then, we build four database tables using probabilities extracted from the manually tagged corpus- word-probability table, previoustag-probability table, starting-tag-probability table and affix-probability table. For testing, we consider three text segments, A, B and C, each of about 1000 words. First the input text is segmented in</context>

Section 6 concludes this paper. 2 Linguistic Characteristics of Assamese In Assamese, secondary forms of words are formed through three processes: affixation, derivation and compounding. Affixes play a very important role in word formation. Affixes are used in the formation of relational nouns and pronouns, and in the inflection of verbs with respect to number, person, tense, aspect and mood. For example, Table 1 shows how a relational noun ❡❞✄t❆ (deutA: father) is inflected depending on number and person (Goswami, 2003). Though Assamese is relatively free word order, yet the predominant word order is subject-object-verb (SOV). The following paragraphs describe just a few of the many characteristics of Assamese text that make the tagging task complex. • Depending on the context, even a common word may have different POS tags. For example: If ❦❆r❡◆ (kArane), ❞❡r (dare), ✐♥✐♠❡➡ (nimitte), ❡❤t✉ (hetu), etc., are placed after pronominal adjective, they are considered conjunction and if placed after 33 Proceedings of the ACL-IJCNLP 2009 Conference Short Papers, pages 33–36, Suntec, Singapore, 4 August 2009. c�2009</context>

Size of training words : 10000, UWH : Unknown word handling, UPH : Unknown proper noun handling 4 Our Approach We have used a Assamese text corpus (Corpus Asm) of nearly 300,000 words from the online version of the Assamese daily Asomiya Pratidin (Sharma et al., 2008). The downloaded articles use a font-based encoding called Luit. For our experiments we transliterate the texts to a normalised Roman encoding using transliteration software developed by us. We manually tag a part of this corpus, Tr, consisting of nearly 10,000 words for training. We use other portions of Corpus Asm for testing the tagger. There was no tagset for Assamese before we started the project reported in this paper. Due to the morphological richness of the language, many words of Assamese occur in secondary forms in texts. This increases the number of POS tags that needed for the lang</context>

After that next sentence is taken and the same procedure is repeated. 5 Experimental Evaluation The results using the three test segments are summarised in Table 2. The evaluation of the results require intensive manual verification effort. Larger training corpora is likely to produce more accurate results. More reliable results can be obtained using larger test corpora. Table 3 compares our result with other HMM based reported work. Form the table it is clear that 35 Toutanova et al. (2003) obtained the best result for English (97.24%). Among HMM based experiments reported on Indian languages, we have obtained the best result (86.89%). This work is ongoing and the corpus size and the amount of tagged text are being increased on a regular basis. The accuracy of a tagger depends on the size of tagset used, vocabulary used, and size, genre and quality of the corpus used. Our tagset containing 172 tags is rather big compared to other Indian language tagsets. A smaller tagset is likely to give more accurate result, but may give less information about word structure and ambiguity. The</context>
