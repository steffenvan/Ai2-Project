In this paper, we compare three different
generalization methods for in-domain and
cross-domain opinion holder extraction be-
ing simple unsupervised word clustering,
an induction method inspired by distant
supervision and the usage of lexical re-
sources. The generalization methods are
incorporated into diverse classifiers. We
show that generalization causes significant
improvements and that the impact of im-
provement depends on the type of classifier
and on how much training and test data dif-
fer from each other. We also address the
less common case of opinion holders being
realized in patient position and suggest ap-
proaches including a novel (linguistically-
informed) extraction method how to detect
those opinion holders without labeled train-
ing data as standard datasets contain too
few instances of this type.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997084466666667">
Opinion holder extraction is one of the most im-
portant subtasks in sentiment analysis. The ex-
traction of sources of opinions is an essential com-
ponent for complex real-life applications, such
as opinion question answering systems or opin-
ion summarization systems (Stoyanov and Cardie,
2011). Common approaches designed to extract
opinion holders are based on data-driven methods,
in particular supervised learning.
In this paper, we examine the role of general-
ization for opinion holder extraction in both in-
domain and cross-domain classification. General-
ization may not only help to compensate the avail-
ability of labeled training data but also conciliate
domain mismatches.

<listItem confidence="0.885848428571429">
In order to illustrate this, compare for instance
(1) and (2).
(1) Malaysia did not agree to such treatment of Al-Qaeda sol-
diers as they were prisoners-of-war and should be accorded
treatment as provided for under the Geneva Convention.
(2) Japan wishes to build a $21 billion per year aerospace indus-
try centered on commercial satellite development.

<bodyText confidence="0.999862777777778">
Though both sentences contain an opinion
holder, the lexical items vary considerably. How-
ever, if the two sentences are compared on the ba-
sis of some higher level patterns, some similari-
ties become obvious. In both cases the opinion
holder is an entity denoting a person and this en-
tity is an agent1 of some predictive predicate (i.e.
agree in (1) and wishes in (2)), more specifically,
an expression that indicates that the agent utters a
subjective statement. Generalization methods ide-
ally capture these patterns, for instance, they may
provide a domain-independent lexicon for those
predicates. In some cases, even higher order fea-
tures, such as certain syntactic constructions may
vary throughout the different domains. In (1) and
(2), the opinion holders are agents of a predictive
predicate, whereas the opinion holder her daugh-
ters in (3) is a patient2 of embarrasses.

(3) Mrs. Bennet does what she can to get Jane and Bingley to-
gether and embarrasses her daughters by doing so.

<bodyText confidence="0.9998326">
If only sentences, such as (1) and (2), occur in
the training data, a classifier will not correctly ex-
tract the opinion holder in (3), unless it obtains
additional knowledge as to which predicates take
opinion holders as patients.

In this work, we will consider three differ-
ent generalization methods being simple unsuper-
vised word clustering, an induction method and
the usage of lexical resources. We show that gen-
eralization causes significant improvements and
that the impact of improvement depends on how
much training and test data differ from each other.
We also address the issue of opinion holders in
patient position and present methods including a
novel extraction method to detect these opinion
holders without any labeled training data as stan-
dard datasets contain too few instances of them.
In the context of generalization it is also impor-
tant to consider different classification methods
as the incorporation of generalization may have a
varying impact depending on how robust the clas-
sifier is by itself, i.e. how well it generalizes even
with a standard feature set. We compare two state-
of-the-art learning methods, conditional random
fields and convolution kernels, and a rule-based
method.

2 Data
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999650916666667">
As a labeled dataset we mainly use the MPQA
2.0 corpus (Wiebe et al., 2005). We adhere to
the definition of opinion holders from previous
work (Wiegand and Klakow, 2010; Wiegand and
Klakow, 2011a; Wiegand and Klakow, 2011b),
i.e. every source of a private state or a subjective
speech event (Wiebe et al., 2005) is considered an
opinion holder.
This corpus contains almost exclusively news
texts. In order to divide it into different domains,
we use the topic labels from (Stoyanov et al.,
2004). By inspecting those topics, we found that
many of them can grouped to a cluster of news
items discussing human rights issues mostly in
the context of combating global terrorism. This
means that there is little point in considering every
single topic as a distinct (sub)domain and, there-
fore, we consider this cluster as one single domain
ETHICS.3 For our cross-domain evaluation, we
want to have another topic that is fairly different
from this set of documents. By visual inspection,
we found that the topic discussing issues regard-
ing the International Space Station would suit our
purpose. It is henceforth called SPACE.
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.994241">
3The cluster is the union of documents with the following
MPQA-topic labels: axisofevil, guantanamo, humanrights,
mugabe and settlements.

<bodyText confidence="0.999947321428572">
In addition to these two (sub)domains, we
chose some text type that is not even news text
in order to have a very distant domain. There-
fore, we had to use some text not included in the
MPQA corpus. Existing text collections contain-
ing product reviews (Kessler et al., 2010; Toprak
et al., 2010), which are generally a popular re-
source for sentiment analysis, were not found
suitable as they only contain few distinct opinion
holders. We finally used a few summaries of fic-
tional work (two Shakespeare plays and one novel
by Jane Austen4) since their language is notably
different from that of news texts and they con-
tain a large number of different opinion holders
(therefore opinion holder extraction is a meaning-
ful task on this text type). These texts make up
our third domain FICTION. We manually labeled
it with opinion holder information by applying the
annotation scheme of the MPQA corpus.
Table 1 lists the properties of the different do-
main corpora. Note that ETHICS is the largest do-
main. We consider it our primary (source) domain
as it serves both as a training and (in-domain) test
set. Due to their size, the other domains only
serve as test sets (target domains).
For some of our generalization methods, we
also need a large unlabeled corpus. We use the
North American News Text Corpus (LDC95T21).

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998552">
3.1 Word Clustering (Clus)
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999956666666666">
The simplest generalization method that is con-
sidered in this paper is word clustering. By that,
we understand the automatic grouping of words
occurring in similar contexts. Such clusters are
usually computed on a large unlabeled corpus.
Unlike lexical features, features based on clusters
are less sparse and have been proven to signif-
icantly improve data-driven classifiers in related
tasks, such as named-entity recognition (Turian et

al., 2010). Such a generalization is, in particular,
attractive as it is cheaply produced. As a state-
of-the-art clustering method, we consider Brown
clustering (Brown et al., 1992) as implemented in
the SRILM-toolkit (Stolcke, 2002). We induced
1000 clusters which is also the configuration used
in (Turian et al., 2010).5
Table 2 illustrates a few of the clusters induced
from our unlabeled dataset introduced in Section
(§) 2. Some of these clusters represent location
or person names (e.g. I. &amp; II.). This exempli-
fies why clustering is effective for named-entity
recognition. We also find clusters that intuitively
seem to be meaningful for our task (e.g. III. &amp;
IV.) but, on the other hand, there are clusters that
contain words that with the exception of their part
of speech do not have anything in common (e.g.
V.).

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999718">
3.2 Manually Compiled Lexicons (Lex)
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999984666666667">
The major shortcoming of word clustering is that
it lacks any task-specific knowledge. The oppo-
site type of generalization is the usage of manu-
ally compiled lexicons comprising predicates that
indicate the presence of opinion holders, such as
supported, worries or disappointed in (4)-(6).

<bodyText confidence="0.99951775">
We follow Wiegand and Klakow (2011b) who
found that those predicates can be best obtained
by using a subset of Levin’s verb classes (Levin,
1993) and the strong subjective expressions of the
Subjectivity Lexicon (Wilson et al., 2005). For
those predicates it is also important to consider
in which argument position they usually take an
opinion holder. Bethard et al. (2004) found the

</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.999685833333333">
majority of holders are agents (4). A certain
number of predicates, however, also have opinion
holders in patient position, e.g. (5) and (6).
Wiegand and Klakow (2011b) found that many
of those latter predicates are listed in one of
Levin’s verb classes called amuse verbs. While
on the evaluation on the entire MPQA corpus,
opinion holders in patient position are fairly rare
(Wiegand and Klakow, 2011b), we may wonder
whether the same applies to the individual do-
mains that we consider in this work. Table 3
lists the proportion of those opinion holders (com-
puted manually) based on a random sample of 100
opinion holder mentions from those corpora. The
table shows indeed that on the domains from the
MPQA corpus, i.e. ETHICS and SPACE, those
opinion holders play a minor role but there is a no-
tably higher proportion on the FICTION-domain.

3.3 Task-Specific Lexicon Induction (Induc)
3.3.1 Distant Supervision with Prototypical
Opinion Holders
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999275">
Lexical resources are potentially much more
expressive than word clustering. This knowledge,
however, is usually manually compiled, which
makes this solution much more expensive. Wie-
gand and Klakow (2011a) present an intermedi-
ate solution for opinion holder extraction inspired
by distant supervision (Mintz et al., 2009). The
output of that method is also a lexicon of predi-
cates but it is automatically extracted from a large
unlabeled corpus. This is achieved by collecting
predicates that frequently co-occur with prototyp-
ical opinion holders, i.e. common nouns such as
opponents (7) or critics (8), if they are an agent
of that predicate. The rationale behind this is
that those nouns act very much like actual opin-
ion holders and therefore can be seen as a proxy.

(7) Opponents say these arguments miss the point.
(8) Critics argued that the proposed limits were unconstitutional.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997645">
This method reduces the human effort to specify-
ing a small set of such prototypes.
Following the best configuration reported
in (Wiegand and Klakow, 2011a), we extract 250
verbs, 100 nouns and 100 adjectives from our un-
labeled corpus (§2).

is limited to agentive opinion holders. Opinion
holders in patient position, such as the ones taken
by amuse verbs in (5) and (6), are not covered.
Wiegand and Klakow (2011a) show that consid-
ering less restrictive contexts significantly drops
classification performance. So the natural exten-
sion of looking for predicates having prototypical
opinion holders in patient position is not effective.
Sentences, such as (9), would mar the result.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.658904">
(9) They criticized their opponents.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9994694">
In (9) the prototypical opinion holder opponents
(in the patient position) is not a true opinion
holder.
Our novel method to extract those predicates
rests on the observation that the past participle of
those verbs, such as shocked in (10), is very often
identical to some predicate adjective (11) having
a similar if not identical meaning. For the predi-
cate adjective, the opinion holder is, however, its
subject/agent and not its patient.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.977578">
(10) He had shocked,e,.b me. holder:patient
(11) I was shockedadj. holder:agent
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999949027027027">
Instead of extracting those verbs directly (10),
we take the detour via their corresponding pred-
icate adjectives (11). This means that we collect
all those verbs (from our large unlabeled corpus
(§2)) for which there is a predicate adjective that
coincides with the past participle of the verb.
To increase the likelihood that our extracted
predicates are meaningful for opinion holder ex-
traction, we also need to check the semantic type
in the relevant argument position, i.e. make sure
that the agent of the predicate adjective (which
would be the patient of the corresponding verb)
is an entity likely to be an opinion holder. Our
initial attempts with prototypical opinion holders
were too restrictive, i.e. the number of prototyp-
ical opinion holders co-occurring with those ad-
jectives was too small. Therefore, we widen the
semantic type of this position from prototypical
opinion holders to persons. This means that we
allow personal pronouns (i.e. I, you, he, she and
we) to appear in this position. We believe that this
relaxation can be done in that particular case, as
adjectives are much more likely to convey opin-
ions a priori than verbs (Wiebe et al., 2004).
An intrinsic evaluation of the predicates that we
thus extracted from our unlabeled corpus is dif-
ficult. The 250 most frequent verbs exhibiting
this special property of coinciding with adjectives
(this will be the list that we use in our experi-
ments) contains 42% entries of the amuse verbs
(§3.2). However, we also found many other po-
tentially useful predicates on this list that are not
listed as amuse verbs (Table 4). As amuse verbs
cannot be considered a complete golden standard
for all predicates taking opinion holders as pa-
tients, we will focus on a task-based evaluation
of our automatically extracted list (§6).

4 Data-driven Methods
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998275">
In the following, we present the two supervised
classifiers we use in our experiments. Both clas-
sifiers incorporate the same levels of representa-

4.1 Conditional Random Fields (CRF)
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999925458333333">
The supervised classifier most frequently used
for information extraction tasks, in general, are
conditional random fields (CRF) (Lafferty et al.,
2001). Using CRF, the task of opinion holder ex-
traction is framed as a tagging problem in which
given a sequence of observations x = x1x2 ... xn
(words in a sentence) a sequence of output tags
y = y1y2 ... yn indicating the boundaries of opin-
ion holders is computed by modeling the condi-
tional probability P(x|y).
The features we use (Table 5) are mostly in-
spired by Choi et al. (2005) and by the ones
used for plain support vector machines (SVMs)
in (Wiegand and Klakow, 2010). They are orga-
nized into groups. The basic group Plain does not
contain any generalization method. Each other
group is dedicated to one specific generalization
method that we want to examine (Clus, Induc
and Lex). Apart from considering generalization
features indicating the presence of generalization
types, we also consider those types in conjunction
with semantic roles. As already indicated above,
semantic roles are especially important for the de-
tection of opinion holders. Unfortunately, the cor-

responding feature from the Plain feature group
that also includes the lexical form of the predicate
is most likely a sparse feature. For the opinion
holder me in (10), for example, it would corre-
spond to A1 shock. Therefore, we introduce for
each generalization method an additional feature
replacing the sparse lexical item by a generaliza-
tion label, i.e. Clus: A1 CLUSTER-35265, Induc:
A1 INDUC-PRED and Lex: A1 LEX-PRED.6
For this learning method, we use CRF++.7 We
choose a configuration that provides good perfor-
mance on our source domain (i.e. ETHICS).8
For semantic role labeling we use SWIRL9, for
chunk parsing CASS (Abney, 1991) and for con-
stituency parsing Stanford Parser (Klein and Man-
ning, 2003). Named-entity information is pro-
vided by Stanford Tagger (Finkel et al., 2005).

convolution kernels, the structures to be compared
within the kernel function are not vectors com-
prising manually designed features but the under-
lying discrete structures, such as syntactic parse
trees or part-of-speech sequences. Since they are
directly provided to the learning algorithm, a clas-
sifier can be built without taking the effort of im-
plementing an explicit feature extraction.
We take the best configuration from (Wiegand
and Klakow, 2010) that comprises a combination
of three different tree kernels being two tree ker-
nels based on constituency parse trees (one with
predicate and another with semantic scope) and
a tree kernel encoding predicate-argument struc-
tures based on semantic role information. These
representations are illustrated in Figure 1. The re-
sulting kernels are combined by plain summation.
In order to integrate our generalization meth-
ods into the convolution kernels, the input struc-
tures, i.e. the linguistic tree structures, have to be
augmented. For that we just add additional nodes
whose labels correspond to the respective gener-
alization types (i.e. Clus: CLUSTER-ID, Induc:
INDUC-PRED and Lex: LEX-PRED). The nodes
are added in such a way that they (directly) domi-
nate the leaf node for which they provide a gener-
alization.10 If several generalization methods are
used and several of them apply for the same lex-
ical unit, then the (vertical) order of the general-
ization nodes is LEX-PRED &gt;- INDUC-PRED &gt;-
CLUSTER-ID.11 Figure 2 illustrates the predi-
cate argument structure from Figure 1 augmented
with INDUC-PRED and CLUSTER-IDs.
For this learning method, we use the
SVMLight-TK toolkit.12 Again, we tune the
parameters to our source domain (ETHICS).13

The set of predicates is obtained from a given lex-

patients, the default agent-role is overruled.
We consider several classifiers that differ in the
lexicon they use. RB-Lex uses the combination of
the manually compiled lexicons presented in §3.2.
RB-Induc uses the predicates that have been au-
tomatically extracted from a large unlabeled cor-
pus using the methods presented in §3.3. RB-
Induc+Lex considers the union of those lexicons.
In order to examine the impact of modeling opin-
ion holders in patient position, we also introduce
two versions of each lexicon. AG just consid-

Table 6 shows the cross-domain performance of
the different rule-based classifiers. RB-Lex per-
forms better than RB-Induc. In comparison to the
domains ETHICS and SPACE the difference is
larger on FICTION. Presumably, this is due to the
fact that the predicates in Induc are extracted from
a news corpus (§2). Thus, Induc may slightly suf-

the two classifiers, i.e. RB-Lex+Induc, results in
a notable improvement in the FICTION-domain.

6.2 In-Domain Evaluation of
Learning-based Methods
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999286">
Table 7 shows the performance of the learning-
based methods CRF and CK on an in-domain
evaluation (ETHICS-domain) using different
amounts of labeled training data. We carry out
a 5-fold cross-validation and use n% of the train-
ing data in the training folds. The table shows that
CK is more robust than CRF. The fewer training
data are used the more important generalization
becomes. CRF benefits much more from gener-
alization than CK. Interestingly, the CRF config-
uration with the best generalization is usually as
good as plain CK. This proves the effectiveness
of CK. In principle, Lex is the strongest general-
ization method while Clus is by far the weakest.
For Clus, systematic improvements towards no
generalization (even though they are minor) can
only be observed with CRF. As far as combina-
tions are concerned, either Lex+Induc or All per-
forms best. This in-domain evaluation proves that
opinion holder extraction is different from named-
entity recognition. Simple unsupervised general-
ization, such as word clustering, is not effective
and popular sequential classifiers are less robust
than margin-based tree-kernels.
Table 8 complements Table 7 in that it com-
pares the learning-based methods with the best
rule-based classifier and also displays precision
and recall. RB achieves a high recall, whereas the
learning-based methods always excel RB in pre-
cision.14 Applying generalization to the learning-
based methods results in an improvement of both
recall and precision if few training data are used.
The impact on precision decreases, however, the
more training data are added. There is always a
significant increase in recall but learning-based
methods may not reach the level of RB even
though they use the same resources. This is a
side-effect of preserving a much higher precision.
It also explains why learning-based methods with
generalization may have a lower F-score than RB.

6.3 Out-of-Domain Evaluation of
Learning-based Methods
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999922424242424">
Table 9 presents the results of out-of-domain clas-
sifiers. The complete ETHICS-dataset is used for
training. Some properties are similar to the pre-
vious experiments: CK always outperforms CRF.
RB provides a high recall whereas the learning-
based methods maintain a higher precision. Sim-
ilar to the in-domain setting using few labeled
training data, the incorporation of generalization
increases both precision and recall. Moreover, a
combination of generalization methods is better
than just using one method on average, although
Lex is again a fairly robust individual generaliza-
tion method. Generalization is more effective in
this setting than on the in-domain evaluation us-
ing all training data, in particular for CK, since
the training and test data are much more different
from each other and suitable generalization meth-
ods partly close that gap.
There is a notable difference in precision be-
tween the SPACE- and FICTION-domain (and
also the source domain ETHICS (Table 8)). We
strongly assume that this is due to the distribu-
tion of opinion holders in those datasets (Table 1).
The FICTION-domain contains much more opin-
ion holders, therefore the chance that a predicted
opinion holder is correct is much higher.
With regard to recall, a similar level of per-
formance as in the ETHICS-domain can only be
achieved in the SPACE-domain, i.e. CK achieves
a recall of 60%. In the FICTION-domain, how-
ever, the recall is much lower (best recall of CK
is below 47%). This is no surprise as the SPACE-
domain is more similar to the source domain than

discussed in (Wiegand and Klakow, 2011b).

the FICTION-domain since ETHICS and SPACE
are news texts. FICTION contains more out-of-
domain language. Therefore, RB (which exclu-
sively uses domain-independent knowledge) out-
performs both learning-based methods including
the ones incorporating generalization. Similar re-
sults have been observed for rule-based classifiers
from other tasks in cross-domain sentiment anal-
ysis, such as subjectivity detection and polarity
classification. High-level information as it is en-
coded in a rule-based classifier generalizes better
than learning-based methods (Andreevskaia and
Bergler, 2008; Lambov et al., 2009).
We set up another experiment exclusively for
the FICTION-domain in which we combine the
output of our best learning-based method, i.e. CK,
with the prediction of a rule-based classifier. The
combined classifier will predict an opinion holder,
if either classifier predicts one. The motivation for
this is the following: The FICTION-domain is the
only domain to have a significant proportion of
opinion holders appearing as patients. We want
to know how much of them can be recognized
with the best out-of-domain classifier using train-
ing data with only very few instances of this type
and what benefit the addition of using various RBs
which have a clearer notion of these constructions
brings about. Moreover, we already observed that
the learning-based methods have a bias towards
preserving a high precision and this may have as
a consequence that the generalization features in-
corporated into CK will not receive sufficiently
large weights. Unlike the SPACE-domain where
a sufficiently high recall is already achieved with
CK (presumably due to its stronger similarity to-
wards the source domain) the FICTION-domain
may be more severely affected by this bias and
evidence from RB may compensate for this.
Table 10 shows the performance of those com-
bined classifiers. For all generalization types
considered, there is, indeed, an improvement by
adding information from RB resulting in a large
boost in recall. Already the application of our in-
duction approach Induc results in an increase of
more than 8% points compared to plain CK. The
table also shows that there is always some im-
provement if RB considers opinion holders as pa-
tients (AG+PT). This can be considered as some
evidence that (given the available data we use)
opinion holders in patient position can only be ef-
fectively extracted with the help of RBs. It is also

The combined approach in Table 10 not only
outperforms CK (discussed above) but also RB
(Table 6). We manually inspected the output of
the classifiers to find also cases in which CK de-
tect opinion holders that RB misses. CK has the
advantage that it is not only bound to the relation-
ship between candidate holder and predicate. It
learns further heuristics, e.g. that sentence-initial
mentions of persons are likely opinion holders. In
(12), for example, this heuristics fires while RB
overlooks this instance as to give someone a share
of advice is not part of the lexicon.

those methods has not yet been attempted. In
this work, we compare the popular state-of-the-art
learning algorithms conditional random fields and
convolution kernels for the first time. All these
data-driven methods have been evaluated on the
MPQA corpus. Some generalization methods are
incorporated but unlike this paper they are neither
systematically compared nor combined. The role
of resources that provide the knowledge of argu-
ment positions of opinion holders is not covered
in any of these works. This kind of knowledge
should be directly learnt from the labeled train-
ing data. In this work, we found, however, that
the distribution of argument positions of opinion
holders varies throughout the different domains
and, therefore, cannot be learnt from any arbitrary
out-of-domain training set.
Bethard et al. (2004) and Kim and Hovy (2006)
explore the usefulness of semantic roles provided
by FrameNet (Fillmore et al., 2003). Bethard
et al. (2004) use this resource to acquire labeled
training data while in (Kim and Hovy, 2006)
FrameNet is used within a rule-based classifier
mapping frame-elements of frames to opinion
holders. Bethard et al. (2004) only evaluate on an
artificial dataset (i.e. a subset of sentences from
FrameNet and PropBank (Kingsbury and Palmer,
2002)). The only realistic test set on which Kim
and Hovy (2006) evaluate their approach are news
texts. Their method is compared against a sim-
ple rule-based baseline and, unlike this work, not
against a robust data-driven algorithm.
(Wiegand and Klakow, 2011b) is similar to
(Kim and Hovy, 2006) in that a rule-based ap-
proach is used relying on the relationship towards
predictive predicates. Diverse resources are con-
sidered for obtaining such words, however, they
are only evaluated on the entire MPQA corpus.
The only cross-domain evaluation of opinion
holder extraction is reported in (Li et al., 2007) us-
ing the MPQA corpus as a training set and the NT-
CIR collection as a test set. A low cross-domain
performance is obtained and the authors conclude
that this is due to the very different annotation
schemes of those corpora.

8 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999990909090909">
We examined different generalization methods for
opinion holder extraction. We found that for in-
domain classification, the more labeled training
data are used, the smaller is the impact of gener-
alization. Robust learning methods, such as con-
volution kernels, benefit less from generalization
than weaker classifiers, such as conditional ran-
dom fields. For cross-domain classification, gen-
eralization is always helpful. Distant domains
are problematic for learning-based methods, how-
ever, rule-based methods provide a reasonable re-
call and can be effectively combined with the
learning-based methods. The types of generaliza-
tion that help best are manually compiled lexicons
followed by an induction method inspired by dis-
tant supervision. Finally, we examined the case
of opinion holders as patients and also presented
a novel automatic extraction method that proved
effective. Such dedicated extraction methods are
important as common labeled datasets (from the
news domain) do not provide sufficient training
data for these constructions.

The generalization methods are incorporated into diverse classifiers. We show that generalization causes significant improvements and that the impact of improvement depends on the type of classifier and on how much training and test data differ from each other. We also address the less common case of opinion holders being realized in patient position and suggest approaches including a novel (linguisticallyinformed) extraction method how to detect those opinion holders without labeled training data as standard datasets contain too few instances of this type.</abstract>

We also address the less common case of opinion holders being realized in patient position and suggest approaches including a novel (linguisticallyinformed) extraction method how to detect those opinion holders without labeled training data as standard datasets contain too few instances of this type. 1 Introduction Opinion holder extraction is one of the most important subtasks in sentiment analysis. The extraction of sources of opinions is an essential component for complex real-life applications, such as opinion question answering systems or opinion summarization systems (Stoyanov and Cardie, 2011). Common approaches designed to extract opinion holders are based on data-driven methods, in particular supervised learning. In this paper, we examine the role of generalization for opinion holder extraction in both indomain and cross-domain classification. Generalization may not only help to compensate the availability of labeled training data but also conciliate domain mismatches. In order to illustrate this, compare for instance (1) and (2). (1) Malaysia did not agree to such treatment of Al-Qaeda soldiers as they were prisoners-of-war and should be accorded treatment as provided for under </context>

We adhere to the definition of opinion holders from previous work (Wiegand and Klakow, 2010; Wiegand and Klakow, 2011a; Wiegand and Klakow, 2011b), i.e. every source of a private state or a subjective speech event (Wiebe et al., 2005) is considered an opinion holder. This corpus contains almost exclusively news texts. In order to divide it into different domains, we use the topic labels from (Stoyanov et al., 2004). By inspecting those topics, we found that many of them can grouped to a cluster of news items discussing human rights issues mostly in the context of combating global terrorism. This means that there is little point in considering every single topic as a distinct (sub)domain and, therefore, we consider this cluster as one single domain ETHICS.3 For our cross-domain evaluation, we want to have another topic that is fairly different from this set of documents. By visual inspection, we found that the topic discussing issues regarding the International Space Station would suit our purpose. It is</context>

In the context of generalization it is also important to consider different classification methods as the incorporation of generalization may have a varying impact depending on how robust the classifier is by itself, i.e. how well it generalizes even with a standard feature set. We compare two stateof-the-art learning methods, conditional random fields and convolution kernels, and a rule-based method. 2 Data As a labeled dataset we mainly use the MPQA 2.0 corpus (Wiebe et al., 2005). We adhere to the definition of opinion holders from previous work (Wiegand and Klakow, 2010; Wiegand and Klakow, 2011a; Wiegand and Klakow, 2011b), i.e. every source of a private state or a subjective speech event (Wiebe et al., 2005) is considered an opinion holder. This corpus contains almost exclusively news texts. In order to divide it into different domains, we use the topic labels from (Stoyanov et al., 2004). By inspecting those topics, we found that many of them can grouped to a cluster of news items discussing human rights issues mostly in the context of combating global terrorism. </context>
