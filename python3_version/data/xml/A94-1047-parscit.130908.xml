Abstract

FoG currently produces bilingual marine
and public weather forecasts at several
Canadian weather offices. The system
is engineered to reflect &amp;quot;good professional
style&amp;quot; as found in human forecasts. How-
ever, some regularization and simplifica-
tion of the output has been needed. Sub-
language engineering issues include trade-
offs in coverage and style, handling varia-
tion and evolution of sublanguages, &amp;quot;leg-
islating&amp;quot; lexical semantics and assuring a
language model able to accomodate new
text types and support spoken output.

1 Background and System Overview
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995463327272728">
FoG (for Forecast Generator) was developed dur-
ing 1985-89 (Kittredge et al., 1986; Bourbeau et al.,
1990). After tests at Environment Canada during
1989-91, FoG entered regular use during 1991-92,
first for marine forecasts, and more recently for pub-
lic forecasts. Forty percent of the operational marine
forecasts (roughly half of all marine forecast text) in
Canada is now produced using FoG.
Meteorologists have been very receptive to using
FoG, which is now a &amp;quot;back-end&amp;quot; facility of the FPA
graphics workstation. The FPA supports the graph-
ical analysis of weather while providing the rule-
based concept formation needed to drive both text
generation and non-linguistic applications. Meteo-
rologists now concentrate on weather analysis and
give less thought to how forecasts should be verbal-
ized. Still, it has taken much time and effort to fit
text generation into their work environment, and re-
spond to new requirements. Operational experience
has shown that some linguistic refinements first pro-
posed during design were of low priority to users,
compared with other features which were not origi-
nally anticipated.
Early work on FoG set up a specialized sublan-
guage grammar for marine forecasts, based on anal-
ysis of more than 100,000 words of archived En-
glish text. Corpus analysis of each forecast type has
been supplemented by interviews and other means to
check validity of categorizations and rules. In con-
trast to earlier work on machine translation (TAUM-
METE0), where sublanguage grammars had to be
relatively complete to recognize each possible hu-
man input text, generation of forecasts from con-
cepts provides an opportunity to &amp;quot;engineer out&amp;quot; in-
frequent words and sentence patterns as long as each
intended text content coming into the text planner
is sayable in good quality text. The simplification
and regularization of sublanguage grammars raises
questions for engineering design. We are no longer
just engineering the system to fit the sublanguage,
but also engineering the output sublanguage itself to
achieve goals such as simplicity (without significant
loss of expressiveness) and clarity.
Different types of forecasts have differences in
word usage, grammatical patterns and text struc-
ture, but the similarities are strong enough for them
to be treated withing the same grammatical frame-
work. This means that they require different text
planners (and lexicons), but can use similar gram-
matical realizers. Significantly, English and French
forecasts issued in Canada use the same principles
for determining sentence boundaries, ordering and
combining clauses, and formatting the output text.
This greatly simplifies the problem of bilingual fore-
cast generation in FoG.

FoG uses three major stages to compose forecasts:
(1) graphically mediated content determination, (2)
text planning resulting in interlingual forms, and
(3) realization of English and French texts from
the interlingua. Details are given in (Kittredge and

2 Sublanguage Engineering Issues
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999934670588236">
Early corpus analysis of marine forecasts identi-
fied a few kinds of information which were be-
ing conveyed with high frequency, as well as a
&amp;quot;mixed bag&amp;quot; of phenomena of much lower frequency
(e.g., WINDS HIGHER IN FJORDS and FOG LIFTING
AS WINDS GRADUALLY INCREASE in Arctic regions).
It was decided not to generate those sentence types
requiring deep meteorological reasoning, to avoid
high implementation cost. Over time, however,
there has been some pressure to convey low fre-
quency information which has significant value for
marine safety (e.g., unexpectedly high winds in Arc-
tic fjords). Use of a corpus has facilitated bringing
low-frequency problems to the attention of system
builders and users, so that deliberate design deci-
sions can be made before the system is implemented.
An early goal in FoG was to generate text with
stylistic variation by making use of paraphrase al-
ternatives. Text generation typically provides an
opportunity to introduce paraphrase variation, al-
though the traditional problem has been finding
ways of choosing from among the possible alterna-
tives (Iordanskaja et al., 1991). However, many in-
stances of apparent free variation turned out to have
a tendency toward contextual determination, and it
appeared easiest to build these tendencies into strict
rules. In other cases individual forecasters voiced a
clearcut preference for one variant form, which was
subsequently implemented as the unique choice, at
least for a given weather centre. The final result was
the elimination of paraphrase from the generator. It
is not clear that this is optimal, but it has simpli-
fied the design and implementation process during
a phase when forecasters felt that there were more
urgent problems.
One of the surprises in the development of FoG has
been the constant evolution of language usage initi-
ated by forecasters. New phenomena are being in-
troduced (e.g., ultraviolet radiation warnings), other
phenomena are de-emphasized, and better ways are
found to say the same thing. The reasons for this
have been quite varied and often specific to a given
forecasting office and its client community. The con-
stant &amp;quot;drift&amp;quot; of sublanguage usage at individual fore-
casting sites has led to maintenance of local vari-
ant systems. The flow of change requests has con-
firmed the need to keep the components of FoG in
their most declarative and transparent form for easy
maintenance.
Early work showed cases where roughly synony-
mous words turned out to have somewhat differ-
ent fuzzy semantics. For example winds can both
&amp;quot;strengthen&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;increase&amp;quot;, but the former term
tends to be used with high wind speeds. We incor-
porated a strict separation rule by &amp;quot;legislating&amp;quot; a
point on the wind speed scale to separate the two
word definitions. In other cases, apparently random
variation in usage by forecasters led to an attempt
to introduce a reasonable set of criteria for choos-
ing one variant form over another. It appears that
the very idea of free variation in forecast wording is
difficult for forecasters to accept, and this natural
tendency actually makes life easier (but less inter-
esting) for system designers.
Future extensions to FoG are planned, including
new forecast types (e.g., technical synopses) and an
option for synthesized speech output, building on the
existing linguistic model. We would also like to gen-
erate forecasts in languages such as Inuktitut, but
this may require a deeper interlingual representa-
tion, such as the semantic net already used in other
applications (Iordanskaja et al., 1991). However,
languages like Inuktitut also use different conceptu-
alizations of the weather than English and French,
which might go beyond the capabilities of the FPA.
Recent attempts to produce spoken forecasts with
concatenated speech techniques or commercial text-
to-speech output devices suffer from a lack of good
prosody. FoG&apos;s Meaning-Text language model pro-
vides for explicit prosodic structure, percolating
from the interlingual representation to a new pho-
netic representation level. Contrastive stress will
come from text planning, while most other features
affecting pitch will come from surface syntactic spec-
ifications.
