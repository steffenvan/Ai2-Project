Extracting opinion targets and opinion
words from online reviews are two fun-
damental tasks in opinion mining. This
paper proposes a novel approach to col-
lectively extract them with graph co-
ranking. First, compared to previous
methods which solely employed opinion
relations among words, our method con-
structs a heterogeneous graph to model
two types of relations, including seman-
tic relations and opinion relations. Next,
a co-ranking algorithm is proposed to es-
timate the confidence of each candidate,
and the candidates with higher confidence
will be extracted as opinion targets/words.
In this way, different relations make coop-
erative effects on candidates’ confidence
estimation. Moreover, word preference
is captured and incorporated into our co-
ranking algorithm. In this way, our co-
ranking is personalized and each candi-
date’s confidence is only determined by its
preferred collocations. It helps to improve
the extraction precision. The experimen-
tal results on three data sets with differ-
ent sizes and languages show that our ap-
proach achieves better performance than
state-of-the-art methods.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.997552549019608">
In opinion mining, extracting opinion targets and
opinion words are two fundamental subtasks.
Opinion targets are objects about which users’
opinions are expressed, and opinion words are
words which indicate opinions’ polarities. Ex-
tracting them can provide essential information
for obtaining fine-grained analysis on customers’
opinions. Thus, it has attracted a lot of attentions
(Hu and Liu, 2004b; Liu et al., 2012; Moghaddam
and Ester, 2011; Mukherjee and Liu, 2012).
To this end, previous work usually employed a
collective extraction strategy (Qiu et al., 2009; Hu
and Liu, 2004b; Liu et al., 2013b). Their intuition
is: opinion words usually co-occur with opinion
targets in sentences, and there are strong modifi-
cation relationship between them (called opinion
relation in (Liu et al., 2012)). If a word is an
opinion word, other words with which that word
having opinion relations will have highly proba-
bility to be opinion targets, and vice versa. In this
way, extraction is alternatively performed and mu-
tual reinforced between opinion targets and opin-
ion words. Although this strategy has been widely
employed by previous approaches, it still has sev-
eral limitations.
1) Only considering opinion relations is in-
sufficient. Previous methods mainly focused on
employing opinion relations among words for
opinion target/word co-extraction. They have in-
vestigated a series of techniques to enhance opin-
ion relations identification performance, such as
nearest neighbor rules (Liu et al., 2005), syntactic
patterns (Zhang et al., 2010; Popescu and Etzioni,
2005), word alignment models (Liu et al., 2012;
Liu et al., 2013b; Liu et al., 2013a), etc. How-
ever, we are curious that whether merely employ-
ing opinion relations among words is enough for
opinion target/word extraction? We note that there
are additional types of relations among words. For
example, “LCD” and “LED” both denote the same
aspect “screen” in TV set domain, and they are
topical related. We call such relations between
homogeneous words as semantic relations. If we
have known “LCD” to be an opinion target, “LED”
is naturally to be an opinion target. Intuitively,
besides opinion relations, semantic relations may
provide additional rich clues for indicating opin-
ion targets/words. Which kind of relations is more
effective for opinion targets/words extraction? Is it
beneficial to consider these two types of relations
together for the extraction? To our best knowl-

edge, these problems have seldom been studied
before (see Section 2).
2) Ignoring word preference. When employ-
ing opinion relations to perform mutual reinforc-
ing extraction between opinion targets and opin-
ion words, previous methods depended on opin-
ion associations among words, but seldom consid-
ered word preference. Word preference denotes
a word’s preferred collocations. Intuitively, the
confidence of a candidate being an opinion tar-
get (opinion word) should mostly be determined
by its word preferences rather than all words hav-
ing opinion relations with it. For example
“This camera’s price is expensive for me.”
“It’s price is good.”
“Canon 40D has a good price.”
In these three sentences, “price” is modified by
“good” more times than “expensive”. In tradi-
tional extraction strategy, opinion associations are
usually computed based on the co-occurrence fre-
quency. Thus, “good” has more strong opinion
association with “price” than “expensive”, and it
would have more contributions on determining
“price” to be an opinion target or not. It’s un-
reasonable. “Expensive” actually has more re-
latedness with “price” than “good”, and “expen-
sive” is likely to be a word preference for “price”.
The confidence of “price” being an opinion target
should be influenced by “expensive” in greater ex-
tent than “good”. In this way, we argue that the
extraction will be more precise.
Figure 1: Heterogeneous Graph: OC means opin-
ion word candidates. TC means opinion target
candidates. Solid curves and dotted lines respec-
tively mean semantic relations and opinion rela-
tions between two candidates.
Thus, to resolve these two problems, we present
a novel approach with graph co-ranking. The col-
lective extraction of opinion targets/words is per-
formed in a co-ranking process. First, we oper-
ate over a heterogeneous graph to model seman-
tic relations and opinion relations into a unified
model. Specifically, our heterogeneous graph is
composed of three subgraphs which model differ-
ent relation types and candidates, as shown in Fig-
ure 1. The first subgraph Ga represents semantic
relations among opinion target candidates, and the
second subgraph G&amp;quot; models semantic relations
among opinion word candidates. The third part
is a bipartite subgraph G&amp;quot;, which models opinion
relations among different candidate types and con-
nects the above two subgraphs together. Then we
perform a random walk algorithm on Ga, G&amp;quot; and
G&amp;quot; separately, to estimate all candidates’ confi-
dence, and the entries with higher confidence than
a threshold are correspondingly extracted as opin-
ion targets/words. The results could reflect which
type of relation is more useful for the extraction.
Second, a co-ranking algorithm, which incor-
porates three separate random walks on Ga, G&amp;quot;
and G&amp;quot; into a unified process, is proposed to
perform candidate confidence estimation. Differ-
ent relations may cooperatively affect candidate
confidence estimation and generate more global
ranking results. Moreover, we discover each can-
didate’s preferences through topics. Such word
preference will be different for different candi-
dates. We add word preference information into
our algorithm and make our co-ranking algorithm
be personalized. A candidate’s confidence would
mainly absorb the contributions from its word
preferences rather than its all neighbors with opin-
ion relations, which may be beneficial for improv-
ing extraction precision.
We perform experiments on real-world datasets
from different languages and different domains.
Results show that our approach effectively im-
proves extraction performance compared to the
state-of-the-art approaches.

There are many significant research efforts on
opinion targets/words extraction (sentence level
and corpus level). In sentence level extraction,
previous methods (Wu et al., 2009; Ma and Wan,
2010; Li et al., 2010; Yang and Cardie, 2013)
mainly aimed to identify all opinion target/word
mentions in sentences. They regarded it as a se-
quence labeling task, where several classical mod-
els were used, such as CRFs (Li et al., 2010) and
SVM (Wu et al., 2009).
This paper belongs to corpus level extraction,
and aims to generate a sentiment lexicon and a
target list rather than to identify mentions in sen-

tences. Most of previous corpus-level methods
adopted a co-extraction framework, where opin-
ion targets and opinion words reinforce each other
according to their opinion relations. Thus, how
to improve opinion relations identification perfor-
mance was their main focus. (Hu and Liu, 2004a)
exploited nearest neighbor rules to mine opinion
relations among words. (Popescu and Etzioni,
2005) and (Qiu et al., 2011) designed syntactic
patterns to perform this task. (Zhang et al., 2010)
promoted Qiu’s method. They adopted some spe-
cial designed patterns to increase recall. (Liu et
al., 2012; Liu et al., 2013a; Liu et al., 2013b) em-
ployed word alignment model to capture opinion
relations rather than syntactic parsing. The exper-
imental results showed that these alignment-based
methods are more effective than syntax-based ap-
proaches for online informal texts. However, all
aforementioned methods only employed opinion
relations for the extraction, but ignore consider-
ing semantic relations among homogeneous can-
didates. Moreover, they all ignored word prefer-
ence in the extraction process.
In terms of considering semantic relations
among words, our method is related with sev-
eral approaches based on topic model (Zhao et
al., 2010; Moghaddam and Ester, 2011; Moghad-
dam and Ester, 2012a; Moghaddam and Ester,
2012b; Mukherjee and Liu, 2012). The main
goals of these methods weren’t to extract opin-
ion targets/words, but to categorize all given as-
pect terms and sentiment words. Although these
models could be used for our task according to the
associations between candidates and topics, solely
employing semantic relations is still one-sided and
insufficient to obtain expected performance.
Furthermore, there is little work which consid-
ered these two types of relations globally (Su et
al., 2008; Hai et al., 2012; Bross and Ehrig, 2013).
They usually captured different relations using co-
occurrence information. That was too coarse to
obtain expected results (Liu et al., 2012). In ad-
dition, (Hai et al., 2012) extracted opinion tar-
gets/words in a bootstrapping process, which had
an error propagation problem. In contrast, we per-
form extraction with a global graph co-ranking
process, where error propagation can be effec-
tively alleviated. (Su et al., 2008) used heteroge-
neous relations to find implicit sentiment associ-
ations among words. Their aim was only to per-
form aspect terms categorization but not to extract
opinion targets/words. They extracted opinion tar-
gets/words in advanced through simple phrase de-
tection. Thus, the extraction performance is far
from expectation.

3 The Proposed Method
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999192483870968">
In this section, we propose our method in detail.
We formulate opinion targets/words extraction as
a co-ranking task. All nouns/noun phrases are re-
garded as opinion target candidates, and all ad-
jectives/verbs are regarded as opinion word candi-
dates, which are widely adopted by pervious meth-
ods (Hu and Liu, 2004a; Qiu et al., 2011; Wang
and Wang, 2008; Liu et al., 2012). Then each can-
didate will be assigned a confidence and ranked,
and the candidates with higher confidence than a
threshold will be extracted as the results.
Different from traditional methods, besides
opinion relations among words, we additionally
capture semantic relations among homogeneous
candidates. To this end, a heterogeneous undi-
rected graph G = (V, E) is constructed. V =
V t U V o denotes the vertex set, which includes
opinion target candidates vt E V t and opinion
word candidates vo E V o. E denotes the edge
set, where eij E E means that there is a relation
between two vertices. Ett C E represents the se-
mantic relations between two opinion target candi-
dates. Eoo C E represents the semantic relations
between two opinion word candidates. Eto C E
represents the opinion relations between opinion
target candidates and opinion word candidates.
Based on different relation types, we used three
matrices Mtt E R|V t|×|V t|, Moo E R|V o|×|V o|
and Mto E R|V t|×|V o |to record the association
weights between any two vertices, respectively.
Section 3.4 will illustrate how to construct them.

To estimate the confidence of each candidate, we
use a random walk algorithm on our graph to per-

relations among words. Their basic assumption is
as follows.

be an opinion word, the words which

are remarkably distribution difference of them on
different domains (in-domain Din vs. out-domain

in Dout, it’s likely to be an opinion target in Din.

converges or in a fixed iteration number Iter. In
experiments, we set Iter = 200.
Obtaining Word Preference. The co-ranking
algorithm in Eq.4 is based on a standard random
walking algorithm, which randomly selects a link
according to the association matrix Mto, Mtt and
Moo, or jumps to a random node with prior confi-
dence value. However, it generates a global rank-
ing over all candidates without taking the node
preference (word preference) into account. As
mentioned in the first section, each opinion tar-
get/word has its preferred collocations, it’s reason-
able that the confidence of an opinion target (opin-
ion word) candidate should be preferentially de-
termined by its preferences, rather than all of its
neighbors with opinion relations.
To obtain the word preference, we resort to top-
ics. We believe that if an opinion word vio is
topical related with a target word vjt, vio can be
regarded as a word preference for vjt, and vice
versa. For example, “price” and “expensive” are
topically related in phone’s domain, so they are a
word preference for each other.
Specifically, we use a vector PTi =
[PTi

In this section, we explain how to capture seman-

transition matrices Mtt, Moo and Mto.
Capturing Semantic Relations: For captur-
ing semantic relations among homogenous candi-
dates, we employ topics. We believe that if two
candidates share similar topics in the corpus, there
is a strong semantic relation between them. Thus,
we employ a LDA variation (Mukherjee and Liu,
2012), an extension of (Zhao et al., 2010), to dis-
cover topic distribution on words, which sampled
all words into two separated observations: opinion
targets and opinion words. It’s because that we are
only interested in topic distribution of opinion tar-
gets/words, regardless of other useless words, in-
cluding conjunctions, prepositions etc. This model
has been proven to be better than the standard
LDA model and other LDA variations for opinion
mining (Mukherjee and Liu, 2012).
After topic modeling, we obtain the proba-
bility of the candidates (vt and vo) to topic z,
i.e. p(z|vt) and p(z|vo), and topic distribution
p(z). Then, a symmetric Kullback-Leibler diver-
gence as same as Eq.5 is used to calculate the se-
mantical associations between any two homoge-
nous candidates. Thus, we obtain SA(vt, vt) and
SA(vo, vo), which correspond to the entries in
Mtt and Moo, respectively.
Capturing Opinion Relations: To capture
opinion relations among words and construct the
transition matrix Mto, we used an alignment-
based method proposed in (Liu et al., 2013b).
This approach models capturing opinion relations
as a monolingual word alignment process. Each
opinion target can find its corresponding mod-
ifiers in sentences through alignment, in which
multiple factors are considered globally, such as
co-occurrence information, word position in sen-
tence, etc. Moreover, this model adopted a par-
tially supervised framework to combine syntac-
tic information with alignment results, which has
been proven to be more precise than the state-of-
the-art approaches for opinion relations identifica-
tion (Liu et al., 2013b).
After performing word alignment, we obtain
a set of word pairs composed of a noun (noun
phrase) and its corresponding modified word.
Then, we simply employ Pointwise Mutual Infor-
mation (PMI) to calculate the opinion associations
among words as the entries in Mto. OA(vt, vo) =

p(vt)p(vo), where vt and vo denote an opinion
target candidate and an opinion word candidate,
respectively. p(vt, vo) is the co-occurrence prob-
ability of vt and vo based on the opinion relation
identification results. p(vt) and p(vo) give the in-
dependent occurrence probability of of vt and vo,
respectively

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999099730769231">
Datasets: To evaluate the proposed method, we
used three datasets. The first one is Customer
Review Datasets (CRD), used in (Hu and Liu,
2004a), which contains reviews about five prod-
ucts. The second one is COAE2008 dataset22,
which contains Chinese reviews about four prod-
ucts. The third one is Large, also used in (Wang
et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2013a),
where two domains are selected (Mp3 and Hotel).
As mentioned in (Liu et al., 2012), Large con-
tains 6,000 sentences for each domain. Opinion
targets/words are manually annotated, where three
annotators were involved. Two annotators were
required to annotate out opinion words/targets in
reviews. When conflicts occur, the third annota-
tor make final judgement. In total, we respectively
obtain 1,112, 1,241 opinion targets and 334, 407
opinion words in Hotel, MP3.
Pre-processing: All sentences are tagged to
obtain words’ part-of-speech tags using Stanford
NLP tool3. And noun phrases are identified using
the method in (Zhu et al., 2009) before extraction.
Evaluation Metrics: We select precision(P),
recall(R) and f-measure(F) as metrics. And a sig-
nificant test is performed, i.e., a t-test with a de-
fault significant level of 0.05.

Hu extracted opinion targets/words using asso-
ciation mining rules (Hu and Liu, 2004a).
DP used syntax-based patterns to capture opin-
ion relations in sentences, and then used a boot-
strapping process to extract opinion targets/words
(Qiu et al., 2011),.
Zhang is proposed by (Zhang et al., 2010).
They also used syntactic patterns to capture opin-
ion relations between words. Then a HITS (Klein-
berg, 1999) algorithm is employed to extract opin-
ion targets.
Liu is proposed by (Liu et al., 2013a), an ex-
tension of (Liu et al., 2012). They employed a
word alignment model to capture opinion relations
among words, and then used a random walking al-
gorithm to extract opinion targets.
Hai is proposed by (Hai et al., 2012), which is
similar to our method. They employed both of se-
mantic relations and opinion relations to extract
opinion words/targets in a bootstrapping frame-
work. But they captured relations only using co-
occurrence statistics. Moreover, word preference
was not considered.
SAS is proposed by (Mukher ee and Liu, 2012),
an extended lda-based model of (Zhao et al.,
2010). The top K items for each aspect are ex-
tracted as opinion targets/words. It means that
only semantic relations among words are consid-
ered in SAS. And we set aspects number to be 9 as
same as (Mukher ee and Liu, 2012).
CR: is the proposed method in this paper by us-
ing co-ranking, referring to Eq.4. CR doesn’t con-
sider word preference.
CR WP: is the full implementation of our
method, referring to Eq.6.
Hu, DP, Zhang and Liu are the methods which
only consider opinion relations among words.
SAS is the methods which only consider seman-
tic relations among words. Hai, CR and CR WP
consider these two types of relations together. The
parameter settings of state-of-the-art methods are
same as their original paper. In CR and CR WP,
we set A = 0.4 and µ = 0.1. The experimental
results are shown in Table 2, 3, 4 and 5, where the
last column presents the average F-measure scores
for multiple domains. Since Liu and Zhang aren’t
designed for opinion words extraction, we don’t
present their results in Table 4 and 5. From exper-
imental results, we can see.

<listItem confidence="0.956612571428572">
1) Our methods (CR and CR WP) outperform
other methods not only on opinion targets extrac-
tion but on opinion words extraction in most do-
mains. It proves the effectiveness of the proposed
method.
2) CR and CR WP have much better perfor-
mance than Liu and Zhang, especially on Recall.
Liu and Zhang also use a ranking framework like
ours, but they only employ opinion relations for
extraction. In contrast, besides opinion relations,
CR and CR WP further take semantic relations
into account. Thus, more opinion targets/words
can be extracted. Furthermore, we observe that
CR and CR WP outperform SAS. SAS only ex-
ploits semantic relations, but ignores opinion re-
lations among words. Its extraction is performed
separately and neglects the reinforcement between
opinion targets and opinion words. Thus, SAS has
worse performance than our methods. It demon-
strates the usefulness of considering multiple rela-
tion types.

3) CR and CR WP both outperform Hai. We
believe the reasons are as follows. First, CR and
CR WP considers multiple relations in a unified
process by using graph co-ranking. In contrast,
Hai adopts a bootstrapping framework which per-
forms extraction step by step and may have the
problem of error propagation. It demonstrates
that our graph co-ranking is more suitable for this
task than bootstrapping-based strategy. Second,
our method captures semantic relations using topic
modeling and captures opinion relations through
word alignments, which are more precise than Hai
which merely uses co-occurrence information to
indicate such relations among words. In addition,
word preference is not handled in Hai, but pro-
cessed in CR WP. The results show the usefulness
of word preference for opinion targets/words ex-
traction.
4) CR WP outperforms CR, especially on pre-
cision. The only difference between them is that
CR WP considers word preference when perform-
ing graph ranking for candidate confidence esti-
mation, but CR does not. Each candidate confi-
dence estimation in CR WP gives more weights

This paper presents a novel method with graph co-
ranking to co-extract opinion targets/words. We
model extracting opinion targets/words as a co-
ranking process, where multiple heterogenous re-
lations are modeled in a unified model to make co-
operative effects on the extraction. In addition, we
especially consider word preference in co-ranking
process to perform more precise extraction. Com-
pared to the state-of-the-art methods, experimental
results prove the effectiveness of our method.

<abstract confidence="0.999514172413793">Extracting opinion targets and opinion words from online reviews are two fundamental tasks in opinion mining. This paper proposes a novel approach to collectively extract them with graph coranking. First, compared to previous methods which solely employed opinion relations among words, our method constructs a heterogeneous graph to model two types of relations, including semantic relations and opinion relations. Next, a co-ranking algorithm is proposed to estimate the confidence of each candidate, and the candidates with higher confidence will be extracted as opinion targets/words. In this way, different relations make cooperative effects on candidates’ confidence estimation. Moreover, word preference is captured and incorporated into our coranking algorithm. In this way, our coranking is personalized and each candidate’s confidence is only determined by its preferred collocations. It helps to improve the extraction precision. The experimental results on three data sets with different sizes and languages show that our approach achieves better performance than state-of-the-art methods.</abstract>

The main goals of these methods weren’t to extract opinion targets/words, but to categorize all given aspect terms and sentiment words. Although these models could be used for our task according to the associations between candidates and topics, solely employing semantic relations is still one-sided and insufficient to obtain expected performance. Furthermore, there is little work which considered these two types of relations globally (Su et al., 2008; Hai et al., 2012; Bross and Ehrig, 2013). They usually captured different relations using cooccurrence information. That was too coarse to obtain expected results (Liu et al., 2012). In addition, (Hai et al., 2012) extracted opinion targets/words in a bootstrapping process, which had an error propagation problem. In contrast, we perform extraction with a global graph co-ranking process, where error propagation can be effectively alleviated. (Su et al., 2008) used heterogeneous relations to find implicit sentiment associations among words. Their aim was only to perform aspect terms categorization but not to ex</context>

Zhang is proposed by (Zhang et al., 2010). They also used syntactic patterns to capture opinion relations between words. Then a HITS (Kleinberg, 1999) algorithm is employed to extract opinion targets. Liu is proposed by (Liu et al., 2013a), an extension of (Liu et al., 2012). They employed a word alignment model to capture opinion relations among words, and then used a random walking algorithm to extract opinion targets. Hai is proposed by (Hai et al., 2012), which is similar to our method. They employed both of semantic relations and opinion relations to extract opinion words/targets in a bootstrapping framework. But they captured relations only using cooccurrence statistics. Moreover, word preference was not considered. SAS is proposed by (Mukher ee and Liu, 2012), an extended lda-based model of (Zhao et al., 2010). The top K items for each aspect are extracted as opinion targets/words. It means that only semantic relations among words are considered in SAS. And we set aspects number to be 9 as same as (Mukher ee and Liu, 2012). CR: is the prop</context>

It’s worthy noting that It and Io respectively denote prior confidences of opinion target candidates and opinion word candidates. We argue that opinion targets are usually domain-specific, and there are remarkably distribution difference of them on different domains (in-domain Din vs. out-domain Dout). If a candidate is salient in Din but common in Dout, it’s likely to be an opinion target in Din. Thus, we use a domain relevance measure (DR) (Hai et al., 2013) to compute It. R(t, Din) DR(t) = (2) R(t, Dout) N 1 x EN 1(wtj − 1Wj x EWj k=1 wkj) represents candidate relevance with domain D. wtj = (1 + logTFtj) x log N DFt is a TF-IDF-like weight of candidate t in document j.

Opinion targets are objects about which users’ opinions are expressed, and opinion words are words which indicate opinions’ polarities. Extracting them can provide essential information for obtaining fine-grained analysis on customers’ opinions. Thus, it has attracted a lot of attentions (Hu and Liu, 2004b; Liu et al., 2012; Moghaddam and Ester, 2011; Mukherjee and Liu, 2012). To this end, previous work usually employed a collective extraction strategy (Qiu et al., 2009; Hu and Liu, 2004b; Liu et al., 2013b). Their intuition is: opinion words usually co-occur with opinion targets in sentences, and there are strong modification relationship between them (called opinion relation in (Liu et al., 2012)). If a word is an opinion word, other words with which that word having opinion relations will have highly probability to be opinion targets, and vice versa. In this way, extraction is alternatively</context>

Most of previous corpus-level methods adopted a co-extraction framework, where opinion targets and opinion words reinforce each other according to their opinion relations. Thus, how to improve opinion relations identification performance was their main focus. (Hu and Liu, 2004a) exploited nearest neighbor rules to mine opinion relations among words. (Popescu and Etzioni, 2005) and (Qiu et al., 2011) designed syntactic patterns to perform this task. (Zhang et al., 2010) promoted Qiu’s method. They adopted some special designed patterns to increase recall. (Liu et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2013a; Liu et al., 2013b) employed word alignment model to capture opinion relations rather than syntactic parsing.

Their aim was only to perform aspect terms categorization but not to extract opinion targets/words. They extracted opinion targets/words in advanced through simple phrase detection. Thus, the extraction performance is far from expectation. 3 The Proposed Method In this section, we propose our method in detail. We formulate opinion targets/words extraction as a co-ranking task. All nouns/noun phrases are regarded as opinion target candidates, and all adjectives/verbs are regarded as opinion word candidates, which are widely adopted by pervious methods (Hu and Liu, 2004a; Qiu et al., 2011; Wang and Wang, 2008; Liu et al., 2012). Then each candidate will be assigned a confidence and ranked, and the candidates with higher confidence than a threshold will be extracted as the results. Different from traditional methods, besides opinion relations among words, we additionally capture semantic relations among homogeneous candidates. To this end, a heterogeneous undirected graph G = (V, E) is constructed. V = V t U V o denotes the vertex set, which includes opinion target candidates vt E V t and opinion word candidates vo E V o. E denotes the edge set, where eij E E</context>

Eto C E represents the opinion relations between opinion target candidates and opinion word candidates. Based on different relation types, we used three matrices Mtt E R|V t|×|V t|, Moo E R|V o|×|V o| and Mto E R|V t|×|V o |to record the association weights between any two vertices, respectively. Section 3.4 will illustrate how to construct them. 3.1 Only Considering Opinion Relations To estimate the confidence of each candidate, we use a random walk algorithm on our graph to perform co-ranking. Most previous methods (Hu and Liu, 2004a; Qiu et al., 2011; Wang and Wang, 2008; Liu et al., 2012) only considered opinion relations among words. Their basic assumption is as follows. Assumption 1: If a word is likely to be an opinion word, the words which it has opinion relation with will have higher confidence to be opinion targets, and vice versa. 316 In this way, candidates’ confidences (vt or vo) are collectively determined by each other iteratively. It equals to making random walk on subgraph Gto = (V, Eto) of G. Thus we have Ct = (1 − µ) x Mto x Co + µ x It (1) Co = (1 − µ) x MT to x Ct + µ x Io where Ct and Co respectively </context>

Section 3.4 will illustrate how to construct them. 3.1 Only Considering Opinion Relations To estimate the confidence of each candidate, we use a random walk algorithm on our graph to perform co-ranking. Most previous methods (Hu and Liu, 2004a; Qiu et al., 2011; Wang and Wang, 2008; Liu et al., 2012) only considered opinion relations among words. Their basic assumption is as follows. Assumption 1: If a word is likely to be an opinion word, the words which it has opinion relation with will have higher confidence to be opinion targets, and vice versa. 316 In this way, candidates’ confidences (vt or vo) are collectively determined by each other iteratively. It equals to making random walk on subgraph Gto = (V, Eto) of G. Thus we have Ct = (1 − µ) x Mto x Co + µ x It (1) Co = (1 − µ) x MT to x Ct + µ x Io where Ct and Co respectively </context>

Previous methods mainly focused on employing opinion relations among words for opinion target/word co-extraction. They have investigated a series of techniques to enhance opinion relations identification performance, such as nearest neighbor rules (Liu et al., 2005), syntactic patterns (Zhang et al., 2010; Popescu and Etzioni, 2005), word alignment models (Liu et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2013b; Liu et al., 2013a), etc. However, we are curious that whether merely employing opinion relations among words is enough for opinion target/word extraction? We note that there are additional types of relations among words. For example, “LCD” and “LED” both denote the same aspect “screen” in TV set domain, and they are topical related. We call such relations between homogeneous words as semantic relations. If we have known “LCD” to be an opinion target, “LED” is natura</context>

The experimental results on three data sets with different sizes and languages show that our approach achieves better performance than state-of-the-art methods. 1 Introduction In opinion mining, extracting opinion targets and opinion words are two fundamental subtasks. Opinion targets are objects about which users’ opinions are expressed, and opinion words are words which indicate opinions’ polarities. Extracting them can provide essential information for obtaining fine-grained analysis on customers’ opinions. Thus, it has attracted a lot of attentions (Hu and Liu, 2004b; Liu et al., 2012; Moghaddam and Ester, 2011; Mukherjee and Liu, 2012). To this end, previous work usually employed a collective extraction strategy (Qiu et al., 2009; Hu and Liu, 2004b; Liu et al., 2013b). Their intuition is: opinion words usually co-occur with opinion targets in sentences, and there are strong modification relationship between them (called opinion relation in (Liu et al., 2012)). If a word is an opinion word, other words with which that word having opinion relations will have highly probability to be opinion targets, and vice versa.

Most of previous corpus-level methods adopted a co-extraction framework, where opinion targets and opinion words reinforce each other according to their opinion relations. Thus, how to improve opinion relations identification performance was their main focus. (Hu and Liu, 2004a) exploited nearest neighbor rules to mine opinion relations among words. (Popescu and Etzioni, 2005) and (Qiu et al., 2011) designed syntactic patterns to perform this task. (Zhang et al., 2010) promoted Qiu’s method. They adopted some special designed patterns to increase recall. (Liu et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2013a; Liu et al., 2013b) employed word alignment model to capture opinion relations rather than syntactic parsing. The experimental results showed that these alignment-based methods are more effective than syntax-based approaches for online informal texts.

Although these models could be used for our task according to the associations between candidates and topics, solely employing semantic relations is still one-sided and insufficient to obtain expected performance. Furthermore, there is little work which considered these two types of relations globally (Su et al., 2008; Hai et al., 2012; Bross and Ehrig, 2013). They usually captured different relations using cooccurrence information. That was too coarse to obtain expected results (Liu et al., 2012). In addition, (Hai et al., 2012) extracted opinion targets/words in a bootstrapping process, which had an error propagation problem. In contrast, we perform extraction with a global graph co-ranking process, where error propagation can be effectively alleviated. (Su et al., 2008) used heterogeneous relations to find implicit sentiment associations among words. Their aim was only to perform aspect terms categorization but not to extract opinion targets/words. They extracted opinion targets/words in advanced through simple phrase detection. Thus, the extraction performance is far from expectati</context>

Each opinion target can find its corresponding modifiers in sentences through alignment, in which multiple factors are considered globally, such as co-occurrence information, word position in sentence, etc. Moreover, this model adopted a partially supervised framework to combine syntactic information with alignment results, which has been proven to be more precise than the state-ofthe-art approaches for opinion relations identification (Liu et al., 2013b). After performing word alignment, we obtain a </context>

In sentence level extraction, previous methods (Wu et al., 2009; Ma and Wan, 2010; Li et al., 2010; Yang and Cardie, 2013) mainly aimed to identify all opinion target/word mentions in sentences. They regarded it as a sequence labeling task, where several classical models were used, such as CRFs (Li et al., 2010) and SVM (Wu et al., 2009).

Capturing Semantic Relations: For capturing semantic relations among homogenous candidates, we employ topics. We believe that if two candidates share similar topics in the corpus, there is a strong semantic relation between them. Thus, we employ a LDA variation (Mukherjee and Liu, 2012), an extension of (Zhao et al., 2010), to discover topic distribution on words, which sampled all words into two separated observations: opinion targets and opinion words. It’s because that we are only interested in topic distribution of opinion targets/words, regardless of other useless words, including conjunctions, prepositions etc. This model has been proven to be better than the standard LDA model and other LDA variations for opinion mining (Mukherjee and Liu, 2012). After topic modeling, we obtain the probability of the candidates (vt and vo) to topic z, i.e. p(z|vt) and p(z|vo), and top</context>

Although this strategy has been widely employed by previous approaches, it still has several limitations. 1) Only considering opinion relations is insufficient. Previous methods mainly focused on employing opinion relations among words for opinion target/word co-extraction. They have investigated a series of techniques to enhance opinion relations identification performance, such as nearest neighbor rules (Liu et al., 2005), syntactic patterns (Zhang et al., 2010; Popescu and Etzioni, 2005), word alignment models (Liu et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2013b; Liu et al., 2013a), etc. However, we are curious that whether merely employing opinion relations among words is enough for opinion target/word extraction? We note that there are additional types of relations among words. For example, “LCD” and “LED” both denote the same aspect “screen” in TV set domain, and they are topical related. We call such relations between homogeneous words as semantic relations. If we have known “LCD” to be an opinion target, “LED” is naturally to be an opinion target.

Their aim was only to perform aspect terms categorization but not to extract opinion targets/words. They extracted opinion targets/words in advanced through simple phrase detection. Thus, the extraction performance is far from expectation. 3 The Proposed Method In this section, we propose our method in detail. We formulate opinion targets/words extraction as a co-ranking task. All nouns/noun phrases are regarded as opinion target candidates, and all adjectives/verbs are regarded as opinion word candidates, which are widely adopted by pervious methods (Hu and Liu, 2004a; Qiu et al., 2011; Wang and Wang, 2008; Liu et al., 2012). Then each candidate will be assigned a confidence and ranked, and the candidates with higher confidence than a threshold will be extracted as the results. Different from traditional methods, besides opinion relations among words, we additionally capture semantic relations among homogeneous candidates. To this end, a heterogeneous undirected graph G = (V, E) is constructed. V = V t U V o denotes the vertex set, which includes opinion target candidates vt E V t and opinion word candidates vo E V o. E denotes the edge set, where eij E E means that there is a relation between </context>
<context position="12675" citStr="Wang and Wang, 2008" startWordPosition="1969" endWordPosition="1972">s between two opinion word candidates. Eto C E represents the opinion relations between opinion target candidates and opinion word candidates. Based on different relation types, we used three matrices Mtt E R|V t|×|V t|, Moo E R|V o|×|V o| and Mto E R|V t|×|V o |to record the association weights between any two vertices, respectively. Section 3.4 will illustrate how to construct them. 3.1 Only Considering Opinion Relations To estimate the confidence of each candidate, we use a random walk algorithm on our graph to perform co-ranking. Most previous methods (Hu and Liu, 2004a; Qiu et al., 2011; Wang and Wang, 2008; Liu et al., 2012) only considered opinion relations among words. Their basic assumption is as follows. Assumption 1: If a word is likely to be an opinion word, the words which it has opinion relation with will have higher confidence to be opinion targets, and vice versa. 316 In this way, candidates’ confidences (vt or vo) are collectively determined by each other iteratively. It equals to making random walk on subgraph Gto = (V, Eto) of G. Thus we have Ct = (1 − µ) x Mto x Co + µ x It (1) Co = (1 − µ) x MT to x Ct + µ x Io where Ct and Co respectively represent confidences of opinion targets</context>

The experimental results showed that these alignment-based methods are more effective than syntax-based approaches for online informal texts. However, all aforementioned methods only employed opinion relations for the extraction, but ignore considering semantic relations among homogeneous candidates. Moreover, they all ignored word preference in the extraction process. In terms of considering semantic relations among words, our method is related with several approaches based on topic model (Zhao et al., 2010; Moghaddam and Ester, 2011; Moghaddam and Ester, 2012a; Moghaddam and Ester, 2012b; Mukherjee and Liu, 2012). The main goals of these methods weren’t to extract opinion targets/words, but to categorize all given aspect terms and sentiment words. Although these models could be used for our task according to the associations between candidates and topics, solely employing semantic relations is still one-sided and insufficient to obtain expected performance. Furthermore, there is little work which considered these two types of relations globally (Su et al., 2008; Hai et al., 2012; Bross and Ehri</context>

Capturing Semantic Relations: For capturing semantic relations among homogenous candidates, we employ topics. We believe that if two candidates share similar topics in the corpus, there is a strong semantic relation between them. Thus, we employ a LDA variation (Mukherjee and Liu, 2012), an extension of (Zhao et al., 2010), to discover topic distribution on words, which sampled all words into two separated observations: opinion targets and opinion words. It’s because that we are only interested in topic distribution of opinion targets/words, regardless of other useless words, including conjunctions, prepositions etc. This model has been proven to be better than the standard LDA model and other LDA variations for opinion mining (Mukherjee and Liu, 2012). After topic modeling, we obtain the probability of the candidates (vt and vo) to topic z, i.e. p(z|vt) and p(z|vo), and topic distribution p(z). Then, a symmetr</context>

They employed a word alignment model to capture opinion relations among words, and then used a random walking algorithm to extract opinion targets. Hai is proposed by (Hai et al., 2012), which is similar to our method. They employed both of semantic relations and opinion relations to extract opinion words/targets in a bootstrapping framework. But they captured relations only using cooccurrence statistics. Moreover, word preference was not considered. SAS is proposed by (Mukher ee and Liu, 2012), an extended lda-based model of (Zhao et al., 2010). The top K items for each aspect are extracted as opinion targets/words. It means that only semantic relations among words are considered in SAS. And we set aspects number to be 9 as same as (Mukher ee and Liu, 2012). CR: is the proposed method in this paper by using co-ranking, referring to Eq.4. CR doesn’t consider word preference. CR WP: is the full implementation of our method, referring to Eq.6. Hu, DP, Zhang and Liu are the methods which only consider opinion relations among words. SAS is the methods which only consider semantic relations among words.
