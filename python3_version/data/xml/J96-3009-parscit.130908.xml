A funny title—I surmise that it will often be misquoted as Electronic Words. Is there a
hidden citation behind it? I haven&apos;t been able to trace it.1 Electric Words (henceforth EW,
also used to refer jointly to the three authors) is a report on work done to, and with,
machine-readable dictionaries, in particular LDOCE, the Longman Dictionary of Contem-
porary English (1978 edition). To: Machine-readable dictionaries are often nothing else
than typesetters&apos; tapes, a far cry from lexical data bases. Somewhere in the middle is
EW&apos;s concept of machine-tractable dictionaries, where the information is formalized to
a certain extent, the extent depending on the nature of the information itself, ranging
from the easily formalizable (because simply listable: parts of speech, subcategoriza-
tion codes) to unformalizable (genuine citations, i.e., unrestricted natural language).
With: Machine-tractable dictionaries have been—and are still being—used in a wide
range of NLP applications, such as full-text information retrieval and machine-assisted
translation.
EW offers a world-wide survey, even if the stress (somewhat inevitably) falls on the
work carried out at the Computing Research Lab of the New Mexico State University,
to which the three authors were attached at the time of writing (1993-94). The survey
is carried out on historical principles, an orientation that is bound to be gratifying to
the early workers in the field, who for once get the credit they are due. The historical
perspective also has a sobering effect, showing that the key issues (and even sometimes
techniques) can be traced back to prehistoric times (the sixties—the work carried out
by Karen Sparck Jones is an apposite example).
I do not think there is much point in giving a summary of what is already a

1 In accordance with the usage note of the Collins English Dictionary s.v. electronic: &amp;quot;Electronic is used to
refer to equipment, such as television sets, computers, etc., in which the current is controlled by
transistors, valves, and similar components and also to the components themselves. Electrical is used in
a more general sense, often to refer to the use of electricity as a whole as opposed to other forms of
energy: electrical engineering; an electrical appliance. Electric, in many cases used interchangeably with
electrical, is often restricted to the description of particular devices or to concepts relating to the flow of
current: electric fire; electric charge.&amp;quot;

Graeme Hirst has suggested to me that &amp;quot;in the late 1980s, the use of electric in place of electronic
was a vogue in English, the connotation being to make a high-tech object seem more familiar and
friendly.&amp;quot; He has also suggested that the allusion might be to the title of Louis Rossetto&apos;s
now-deceased language-technology journal Electric Word (the name of which survives as that of the
news-briefs section of his current journal, Wired).

summary. EW&apos;s purpose is not to report on new research,2 but rather to ground the
research reported on in a philosophical perspective. The main body of the book can
be divided into three parts:

<listItem confidence="0.995060916666667">
• A historical overview of theories of meaning, carried on in a spirit of
philosophical inquiry (Chapters 2-4). This section is often polemical in
tone, and Yorick Wilks&apos;s hand is easy to recognize (the abrasive humor
alone would betray the author). The main tenet of the position argued
for is that meaning is symbolical (&amp;quot;meaning is other words or symbols,&amp;quot;
p. 15). From there it follows that primitives are words (of a given natural
language, be it English or Swahili or whatever).
• A look at dictionaries and thesauri as products of the lexicographical
tradition, which relies on a number of central hypotheses, the most
important of which is the divisibility of a word&apos;s semantic space into
word senses (Chapter 5).
• The transformation of machine-readable dictionaries into

<bodyText confidence="0.971070484848485">
machine-tractable dictionaries and an overview of their uses in NLP
(Chapters 6-14). This part includes an interesting discussion of &amp;quot;empty&amp;quot;
heads in dictionary definitions and of the genus-differentiae definition
pattern in general, as well as of genus disambiguation techniques
(Chapter 10).
I think it would have been useful to give the reader a pointer to work that pursues
similar aims without making use of dictionaries at all (pure corpus-based research). I
suggest Grefenstette (1994)3 as a good starting point. The reference would have fitted
nicely in the discussion of the Pathfinder Networks (p. 116 and again p. 128). Similarly,
as a complement to the discussion of the COBUILD dictionary and the corpus it is based
on (p. 101), it is now possible to refer the reader to a very useful CD-ROM, COBUILD
COLLOCATIONS.
A survey such as EW cannot afford to go into details, so it would be wrong to
insist on an in-depth treatment of the issues the authors raise. But they can be blamed
for overusing the phrases in depth and in detail, when all they provide is a cursory
treatment. For instance, on page 125, they claim that the LDOCE codes are described
&amp;quot;in detail&amp;quot; in Chapter 7, where they are assigned a single paragraph (p. 99). On page
125 the description is really too meager to be of much use. Besides, the authors are
liable to mislead the reader when they write &amp;quot;It is usual for verb entries to have more
than one of these codes.&amp;quot; The important thing to note is that the codes are assigned to
word senses, not to whole entries. Without this knowledge it is difficult to understand
the use (discussed in EW) made by Boguraev and Briscoe (1987) of LDOCE grammatical
code assignments to provide a classification of verbs into such classes as subject-raising
verbs, object-equi verbs, etc., on the basis of &amp;quot;suggestions&amp;quot; to be found in my doctoral
dissertation (and further discussed in Michiels 1995).
In general I am very much in agreement with the positions argued for by the
three authors. One area of disagreement is the assessment of the value of LDOCE for
2 Which doesn&apos;t mean, of course, that the reader won&apos;t find anything new for him or her. I have profited
from the very interesting exposition of the technique of simulated annealing (pp. 202-6). I think a
similar treatment ought to have been given to the notion of mutual information (which is mentioned
rather than discussed, p. 185), insofar as it has proved crucial for the study of collocations.
3 EW&apos;s bibliography has only one entry for 1994, so it is probably safer to think of 1993 as
bibliographical terminus ad quem.

some of the research they report on. I think they tend to minimize the problems raised
by the use of a controlled defining vocabulary. In LDOCE lexical &amp;quot;simplicity&amp;quot; is often
bought at the price of syntactic convolution and unnaturalness. I very much doubt that
sense-tagging the defining words in LDOCE definitions always makes sense or even is
always possible. The authors claim (p. 201) that LDOCE&apos;s small defining vocabulary
makes it a useful corpus for obtaining co-occurrence data. But being compelled to use
a controlled vocabulary has often led the LDOCE lexicographers to write definitions
from which it would be very hard to see which word or word sense is being defined
(as in the eighth definition of keep: &amp;quot;to have for some time or for more time&amp;quot;). It is not
clear that the data that one can extract from such definitions are really relevant for
co-occurrence studies, if by these are meant studies of collocational properties. Also,
my experience with the LDOCE tape has taught me that wocE semantic features are
often assigned rather erratically, and that the LDOCE semantic hierarchy itself, with
its inclusion of funny or-features, is not carefully thought out. The authors are more
clearly aware of the danger of using LDOCE examples, which are not genuine, but
coined (&amp;quot;concocted with non-native English speakers in mind,&amp;quot; p. 196).
The survey presented in EW cannot be expected to extend up to the year of
publication of EW itself, 1996. But I think the reader is entitled to know the upper
time limit, and the introduction ought to have mentioned it.&apos; From the bibliography
it would seem that 1993 is the real border, as already mentioned in footnote 3. It is
not surprising, then, that the chapter that already feels the most dated should be the
last, entitled &amp;quot;The present.&amp;quot; In this chapter the authors report on E.C.-funded R&amp;D
projects (p. 245). Besides uncritically repeating the proffered aim (&amp;quot;can be considered
as a follow-up to the Eurotra MT project in an effort to make some use of the lexicons
constructed as part of that enormous enterprise&amp;quot;), they draw up a catalogue of things
to be done (of very little interest unless one is writing a history of European NLP
policies) rather than report on work actually carried out. No fewer than four times
the reader is faced with a curious use of is to in the preterite (e.g., &amp;quot;ET-10 63 was
to enhance the Eurotra system&amp;quot;), which one has the choice of interpreting as either
some kind of epistolary past—as when Cicero ends a letter to Atticus with the word
Valebam, meaning I was in good health (when I wrote this)—or as an uncanny report on
the project&apos;s suspected failure (was to, but didn&apos;t). The Cambridge International Dictionary
of English (ciDE 1995), which the authors do not refer to by name but describe as &amp;quot;the
new dictionary from Cambridge,&amp;quot; i.e., forthcoming, has been sitting on my desk for
quite a while (it came out in the second half of 1995).
A survey of work carried out on machine-readable dictionaries in the years 1993-
96 would probably lay greater emphasis on bilingual dictionaries (cf. the E.C.-funded
DECIDE and COMPASS projects). The judgment passed on such dictionaries in EW—
despite the hedges—sounds a bit harsh: &amp;quot;A printed bilingual dictionary is normally
little more than lists of pairs of equivalent strings from different languages, usually
with some examples of usage mixed in&amp;quot; (p. 208). Good bilingual dictionaries, such as
the Collins bilinguals and Oxford-Hachette (OH 1994), display impressive metalinguistic
apparatus (collocate lists, field labels, grammatical environments, etc.).
On the whole, I find EW a fair and stimulating survey, and I recommend read-
ing it from cover to cover, as I did for the purpose of writing this review. Anybody
who does that will gain an understanding of the philosophical underpinnings of the
lexicographical enterprise and the computational use of its products.

I must now turn to my main criticism of EW, which concerns the lack of care
with which it was written and put together. The authors were wrong to skip lightly
over—not to say skip tout court—the necessary final stages of book production, which
are always of crucial importance, and even more so when more than one writer is
involved.
The contributions have not been carefully integrated into a final product, which
should read like a seamless whole. On the contrary, one all too readily feels the lack of
an overseer. One example among several is the discussion of WordNet. It is distributed
over several sections, which would be acceptable if one felt from that distribution of the
information that that is the best way of building a complex picture. But what we have
is first a general presentation and discussion on pages 126-7, followed on page 145 by
a much shorter introduction, where the authors do refer back to the earlier discussion,
but at the same time give the impression that they do not know (or have totally
forgotten) what is written there. Another striking example of this lack of integration
is provided by the discussion of the ACQUILEX project. On pages 209-11, we get a
discussion of the creation of the ACQUILEX Lexical Knowledge Base and of the so-
called grinding rules (a perceptive and critical assessment), without any reference to
anywhere else in EW. On page 245 ACQUILEX I and II are briefly mentioned, with a
&amp;quot;were discussed earlier in detail&amp;quot; warning, but there is no reference to pages 209-11.
On pages 246-7 we get a new subtitle, &amp;quot;ACQUILEX&amp;quot;, and a very general overview of
the project&apos;s aims, which is what one would have expected to start with (and again,
no pointer to anywhere else in EW).
EW also exhibits problems with &amp;quot;cut-and-paste&amp;quot; passages, probably from earlier
contributions by the authors. A book ought to be written on the negative impact
of word-processing systems on writing skills! Instead of rewriting (which is often
accompanied by some amount of rethinking), we all tend to import and inject into
our texts bits that were written for other purposes. They may be adequate from a
strictly &amp;quot;content&amp;quot; point of view, but they often carry over telltale signs of the context
they were embedded in. A clear example in EW is the final paragraph of Chapter
10 (p. 181), which is not a conclusion at all but an abstract. The chapter is devoted
to &amp;quot;Genus hierarchies and networks,&amp;quot; which of course includes a full discussion of
the derivation of semantic networks from LDOCE. The paragraph in question reads as
follows:
Automatic techniques for selecting the genus term in an LDOCE def-
inition and disambiguating it relative to the senses of LDOCE have
proved very effective. A hierarchy of 39,000 nouns and phrases de-
fined in LDOCE was constructed using these results. Analysis of this
hierarchy shows that it is relatively shallow (the median depth of a
node is two levels down), but this is mostly a consequence of restrict-
ing the defining vocabulary to a small set.
EW is marred by a number of stylistic infelicities. In the best of cases, they are only
annoying (like typos, to be discussed below); at worst, they prevent understanding.
Of the former type are the following:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9962614">
• &amp;quot;[Dictionaries] wait almost all their useful lives on shelves waiting to be
all too briefly consulted&amp;quot; (p. 75);
• &amp;quot;As for the corpus being used to decide how to partition a word into
senses, it should be noted that although the corpus helps the
lexicographer to partition a word into senses, ... &amp;quot; (p. 102).

Of the latter type:

<listItem confidence="0.999337666666667">
• &amp;quot;Other researchers believe that dictionaries may indeed contain sufficient
knowledge, although that knowledge may be implicit, because that
knowledge can be made explicit ... &amp;quot; (p. 142);
• &amp;quot;the gathering aspect is called the Cambridge Language Survey&amp;quot; (p. 244);
• &amp;quot;Various percentages of the system&apos;s semantic lexicon were reduced&amp;quot;
(p. 252).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999365257142857">
It may seem a petty cavil to bring up the question of typos,&apos; but EW exceeds
the tolerance threshold for a published book, let alone an expensive hardback. What
is acceptable for pre-publication conference proceedings is not necessarily acceptable
in a finished product. Particularly exceptionable are the typos that a simple-minded
spelling checker would normally catch: be be (p. 3), nineteeth (p. 65), concerened (p. 86),
examing (p. 107), accomodated (p. 125), aquisition (p. 131), proununciation (p. 139), co-
ocurrences (p. 152), co-ocurrence (p. 186), exisiting (p. 243), sematics (p. 274). My favorite
is Bolf-Berunek and Newman (p. 270): has anybody actually proofread that?—it sounds
as if it came straight out of a (highbrow?) sitcom. In at least one case the reader will
undoubtedly want to know whether the typo is in the corpus or in EW&apos;s printing of
the corpus (edage for edge in the first corpus line of Figure 11.1, p. 187).
What&apos;s worse, some typos might leave the reader somewhat puzzled. Let the
reader make up his or her own errata list with the following: word (p. 40, 1. 4 wood),
and (p. 103, 1. 25 were), I (p. 140, 1. 8 I0), described (p. 234, 1. 1 derived). And I am
still puzzled by the following (should later read as larger?): &amp;quot;Grammatical information
is secondary, but also useful, particularly for the predictions of later grammatical con-
structions that are made possible by the LDOCE comprehensive grammar for English&amp;quot;
(p. 235).
The bibliography would have been clearer if a separate section had been devoted
to dictionaries and corpora. COBULID is mentioned on page 5 and again on page 64,
but is not a bibliographical entry. We have to wait until page 98 to have a reference
to Sinclair 1987a, which has its entry in the reference list (although the text associated
with the entry has an intrusive In as if it were a paper in a book). The reference list
is defaced by a number of typos, some affecting authors&apos; names (Schuetze instead of
Schutze, Morgeai instead of Mergeai). There are also missing entries: Jansen et al. 1985
(referred to on page 209), Krovetz 1992 (p. 98).
The index seems reliable enough, but I have been unable to find the rationale
followed by the authors for the inclusion of people&apos;s names. At some point, I thought
I had found out: proper names are included in the index when they are mentioned in
the body of the text without being included in a bibliographical reference (e.g., Grace
Murray Hopper, p. 28). But pursuing that hypothesis further on in the book proved
it wrong (Guzman and Brady on page 107, Marcus on page 108 are neither in the
bibliography nor in the index).
In conclusion: EW is a valuable survey, but was much too hastily written and put
together.

But being compelled to use controlled vocabulary has often led the to write definitions from which it would be very hard to see which word or word sense is being defined in the eighth definition of have for some time or for more time&amp;quot;). It is not clear that the data that one can extract from such definitions are really relevant for co-occurrence studies, if by these are meant studies of collocational properties. Also, experience with the has taught me that wocE semantic features are assigned rather erratically, and that the hierarchy itself, with its inclusion of funny or-features, is not carefully thought out. The authors are more aware of the danger of using which are not genuine, but coined (&amp;quot;concocted with non-native English speakers in mind,&amp;quot; p. 196). survey presented in be expected to extend up to the year of</abstract>
