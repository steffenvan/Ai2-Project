Classically, training relation extractors relies
on high-quality, manually annotated training
data, which can be expensive to obtain. To
mitigate this cost, NLU researchers have con-
sidered two newly available sources of less
expensive (but potentially lower quality) la-
beled data from distant supervision and crowd
sourcing. There is, however, no study com-
paring the relative impact of these two sources
on the precision and recall of post-learning an-
swers. To fill this gap, we empirically study
how state-of-the-art techniques are affected by
scaling these two sources. We use corpus sizes
of up to 100 million documents and tens of
thousands of crowd-source labeled examples.
Our experiments show that increasing the cor-
pus size for distant supervision has a statis-
tically significant, positive impact on quality
(F1 score). In contrast, human feedback has a
positive and statistically significant, but lower,
impact on precision and recall.

Relation extraction is the problem of populating a
target relation (representing an entity-level relation-
ship or attribute) with facts extracted from natural-
language text. Sample relations include people’s ti-
tles, birth places, and marriage relationships.
Traditional relation-extraction systems rely on
manual annotations or domain-specific rules pro-
vided by experts, both of which are scarce re-
sources that are not portable across domains. To
remedy these problems, recent years have seen in-
terest in the distant supervision approach for rela-
tion extraction (Wu and Weld, 2007; Mintz et al.,
2009). The input to distant supervision is a set of
seed facts for the target relation together with an
(unlabeled) text corpus, and the output is a set of
(noisy) annotations that can be used by any ma-
chine learning technique to train a statistical model
for the target relation. For example, given the tar-
get relation birthPlace(person, place) and a seed
fact birthPlace(John, Springfield), the sentence
“John and his wife were born in Springfield in 1946”
(S1) would qualify as a positive training example.
Distant supervision replaces the expensive pro-
cess of manually acquiring annotations that is re-
quired by direct supervision with resources that al-
ready exist in many scenarios (seed facts and a
text corpus). On the other hand, distantly labeled
data may not be as accurate as manual annotations.
For example, “John left Springfield when he was
16” (S2) would also be considered a positive ex-
ample about place of birth by distant supervision
as it contains both John and Springfield. The hy-
pothesis is that the broad coverage and high redun-
dancy in a large corpus would compensate for this
noise. For example, with a large enough corpus, a
distant supervision system may find that patterns in
the sentence S1 strongly correlate with seed facts of
birthPlace whereas patterns in S2 do not qualify
as a strong indicator. Thus, intuitively the quality of
distant supervision should improve as we use larger
corpora. However, there has been no study on the
impact of corpus size on distant supervision for re-
lation extraction. Our goal is to fill this gap.
Besides “big data,” another resource that may
be valuable to distant supervision is crowdsourc-

ing. For example, one could employ crowd work-
ers to provide feedback on whether distant super-
vision examples are correct or not (Gormley et al.,
2010). Intuitively the crowd workforce is a perfect
fit for such tasks since many erroneous distant la-
bels could be easily identified and corrected by hu-
mans. For example, distant supervision may mistak-
enly consider “Obama took a vacation in Hawaii” a
positive example for birthPlace simply because
a database says that Obama was born in Hawaii;
a crowd worker would correctly point out that this
sentence is not actually indicative of this relation.
It is unclear however which strategy one should
use: scaling the text corpus or the amount of human
feedback. Our primary contribution is to empirically
assess how scaling these inputs to distant supervi-
sion impacts its result quality. We study this ques-
tion with input data sets that are orders of magnitude
larger than those in prior work. While the largest
corpus (Wikipedia and New York Times) employed
by recent work on distant supervision (Mintz et al.,
2009; Yao et al., 2010; Hoffmann et al., 2011) con-
tain about 2M documents, we run experiments on
a 100M-document (50X more) corpus drawn from
ClueWeb.1 While prior work (Gormley et al., 2010)
on crowdsourcing for distant supervision used thou-
sands of human feedback units, we acquire tens of
thousands of human-provided labels. Despite the
large scale, we follow state-of-the-art distant super-
vision approaches and use deep linguistic features,
e.g., part-of-speech tags and dependency parsing.2
Our experiments shed insight on the following
two questions:

<listItem confidence="0.99474">
1. How does increasing the corpus size impact the
quality of distant supervision?

We found that increasing corpus size consistently
and significantly improves recall and F1, despite re-
ducing precision on small corpora; in contrast, hu-
man feedback has relatively small impact on preci-
sion and recall. For example, on a TAC corpus with
1.8M documents, we found that increasing the cor-
pus size ten-fold consistently results in statistically

significant improvement in F1 on two standardized
relation extraction metrics (t-test with p=0.05). On
the other hand, increasing human feedback amount
ten-fold results in statistically significant improve-
ment on F1 only when the corpus contains at least
1M documents; and the magnitude of such improve-
ment was only one fifth compared to the impact of
corpus-size increment.
We find that the quality of distant supervision
tends to be recall gated, that is, for any given rela-
tion, distant supervision fails to find all possible lin-
guistic signals that indicate a relation. By expanding
the corpus one can expand the number of patterns
that occur with a known set of entities. Thus, as a
rule of thumb for developing distant supervision sys-
tems, one should first attempt to expand the training
corpus and then worry about precision of labels only
after having obtained a broad-coverage corpus.
Throughout this paper, it is important to under-
stand the difference between mentions and entities.
Entities are conceptual objects that exist in the world
(e.g., Barack Obama), whereas authors use a variety
of wordings to refer to (which we call “mention”)
entities in text (Ji et al., 2010).

The idea of using entity-level structured data (e.g.,
facts in a database) to generate mention-level train-
ing data (e.g., in English text) is a classic one: re-
searchers have used variants of this idea to extract
entities of a certain type from webpages (Hearst,
1992; Brin, 1999). More closely related to relation
extraction is the work of Lin and Patel (2001) that
uses dependency paths to find answers that express
the same relation as in a question.
Since Mintz et al. (2009) coined the name “dis-
tant supervision,” there has been growing interest in
this technique. For example, distant supervision has
been used for the TAC-KBP slot-filling tasks (Sur-
deanu et al., 2010) and other relation-extraction
tasks (Hoffmann et al., 2010; Carlson et al., 2010;
Nguyen and Moschitti, 2011a; Nguyen and Mos-
chitti, 2011b). In contrast, we study how increas-
ing input size (and incorporating human feedback)
improves the result quality of distant supervision.

abilistic models; such models have recently been
used to relax various assumptions of distant supervi-
sion (Riedel et al., 2010; Yao et al., 2010; Hoffmann
et al., 2011). Specifically, they address the noisy as-
sumption that, if two entities participate in a rela-
tion in a knowledge base, then all co-occurrences of
these entities express this relation. In contrast, we
explore the effectiveness of increasing the training
data sizes to improve distant-supervision quality.
Sheng et al. (2008) and Gormley et al. (2010)
study the quality-control issue for collecting train-
ing labels via crowdsourcing. Their focus is the col-
lection process; in contrast, our goal is to quantify
the impact of this additional data source on distant-
supervision quality. Moreover, we experiment with
one order of magnitude more human labels. Hoff-
mann et al. (2009) study how to acquire end-user
feedback on relation-extraction results posted on an
augmented Wikipedia site; it is interesting future
work to integrate this source in our experiments.
One technique for obtaining human input is active
learning. We tried several active-learning techniques
as described by Settles (2010), but did not observe
any notable advantage over uniform sampling-based
example selection.3

3.1 Distant Supervision
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999505625">
Distant supervision compensates for a lack of train-
ing examples by generating what are known as
silver-standard examples (Wu and Weld, 2007). The
observation is that we are often able to obtain a
structured, but incomplete, database D that instanti-
ates relations of interest and a text corpus C that con-
tains mentions of the entities in our database. For-
mally, a database is a tuple D = (E, R) where E is
a set of entities and R = (Ri ..., RN) is a tuple of
instantiated predicates. For example, Ri may con-
tain pairs of married people.4 We use the facts in Ri
combined with C to generate examples.
Following recent work (Mintz et al., 2009; Yao et
al., 2010; Hoffmann et al., 2011), we use Freebase5
as the knowledge base for seed facts. We use two
text corpora: (1) the TAC-KBP6 2010 corpus that

consists of 1.8M newswire and blog articles7, and
(2) the ClueWeb09 corpus that is a 2009 snapshot
of 500M webpages. We use the TAC-KBP slot fill-
ing task and select those TAC-KBP relations that are
present in the Freebase schema as targets (20 rela-
tions on people and organization).
One problem is that relations in D are defined at
the entity level. Thus, the pairs in such relations are
not embedded in text, and so these pairs lack the
linguistic context that we need to extract features,
i.e., the features used to describe examples. In turn,
this implies that these pairs cannot be used directly
as training examples for our classifier. To generate
training examples, we need to map the entities back
to mentions in the corpus. We denote the relation
that describes this mapping as the relation EL(e, m)
where e E E is an entity in the database D and m is
a mention in the corpus C. For each relation Ri, we
generate a set of (noisy) positive examples denoted
Rt defined as Ri =

As in previous work, we impose the constraint that
both mentions (m1, m2) E Ri are contained in the
same sentence (Mintz et al., 2009; Yao et al., 2010;
Hoffmann et al., 2011). To generate negative ex-
amples for each relation, we follow the assumption
in Mintz et al. (2009) that relations are disjoint and
sample from other relations, i.e., Rti = Uj#iR+ .

Once we have constructed the set of possible men-

recent work on distant supervision (Mintz et al.,

we use both lexical and syntactic features. After
this stage, we have a well-defined machine learn-

mentions (m1, m2) in a sentence, we extract the fol-
lowing features F(m1, m2): (1) the word sequence
(including POS tags) between these mentions after
normalizing entity mentions (e.g., replacing “John
Nolen” with a place holder PER); if the sequence
is longer than 6, we take the 3-word prefix and the

Following Mintz et al. (2009), we use logistic re-

However, while Mintz et al. use a single multi-class
classifier for all relations, Hoffman et al. (2011) and
use an independent binary classifier for each individ-

relation overlapping is rare for TAC-KBP and there
was little difference in result quality, we focus on the
binary-classification approach using training exam-
ples constructed as described in Section 3.1.
We compensate for the different sizes of distant
and human labeled examples by training an objec-
tive function that allows to tune the weight of human
versus distant labeling. We separately tune this pa-

Just as direct training data are scarce, ground truth
for relation extraction is scarce as well. As a result,
prior work mainly considers two types of evaluation
methods: (1) randomly sample a small portion of
predictions (e.g., top-k) and manually evaluate pre-
cision/recall; and (2) use a held-out portion of seed
facts (usually Freebase) as a kind of “distant” ground
truth. We replace manual evaluation with a stan-
dardized relation-extraction benchmark: TAC-KBP
2010. TAC-KBP asks for extractions of 46 relations
on a given set of 100 entities. Interestingly, the Free-
base held-out metric (Mintz et al., 2009; Yao et al.,

biased toward distantly labeled data (e.g., increasing
human feedback hurts precision; see Section 4.6).

<bodyText confidence="0.999990423076923">
Our first group of experiments use the 1.8M-doc
TAC-KBP corpus for training. We exclude from it
the 33K documents that contain query entities in
the TAC-KBP metrics. There are two key param-
eters: the corpus size (#docs) M and human feed-
back budget (#examples) N. We perform different
levels of down-sampling on the training corpus. On
TAC, we use subsets with M = 103,104,105, and
106 documents respectively. For each value of M,
we perform 30 independent trials of uniform sam-
pling, with each trial resulting in a training corpus
DM, 1 G i G 30. For each training corpus DM, we
perform distant supervision to train a set of logistic
regression classifiers. From the full corpus, distant
supervision creates around 72K training examples.
To evaluate the impact of human feedback, we
randomly sample 20K examples from the input cor-
pus (we remove any portion of the corpus that is
used in an evaluation). Then, we ask three differ-
ent crowd workers to label each example as either
positive or negative using the procedure described in
Section 3.3. We retain only credible answers using
the gold-standard method (see Section 3.3), and use
them as the pool of human feedback that we run ex-

N in the range of 0, 10, 102, 103, 104, and 2 x 104.
For each selected corpus and value of N, we per-
form without-replacement sampling from examples
of this corpus to select feedback for up to N exam-
ples. In our experiments, we found that on aver-
age an M-doc corpus contains about 0.04M distant
labels, out of which 0.01M have human feedback.
After incorporating human feedback, we evaluate
the relation extractors on the TAC-KBP benchmark.
We then compute the average F1, recall, and preci-
sion scores among all trials for each metric and each
(M,N) pair. Besides the KBP metrics, we also eval-
uate each (M,N) pair using Freebase held-out data.
Furthermore, we experiment with a much larger cor-
pus: ClueWeb09. On ClueWeb09, we vary M over
103, ... ,108. Using the same metrics, we show at
a larger scale that increasing corpus size can signifi-

We first present our experiment results on the TAC

increasing the corpus size improves F1 at a roughly
log-linear rate, human feedback has little impact un-

In Figure 3(a) we plot a projection of the graphs
in Figure 2 to show the impact of corpus size on
distant-supervision quality. The two curves corre-
spond to when there is no human feedback and when
we use all applicable human feedback. The fact
that the two curves almost overlap indicates that hu-
man feedback had little impact on precision or re-
call. On the other hand, the quality improvement
rate is roughly log-linear against the corpus size.
Recall that each data point in Figure 2 is the aver-
age from 30 trials. To measure the statistical signif-
icance of changes in F1, we calculate t-test results
to compare adjacent corpus size levels given each
fixed human feedback level. As shown in Table 2(a),
increasing the corpus size by a factor of 10 consis-
tently and significantly improves F1. Although pre-
cision decreases as we use larger corpora, the de-
creasing trend is sub-log-linear and stops at around
100K docs. On the other hand, recall and F1 keep
increasing at a log-linear rate.

human labels, we train extraction models with hu-

F1 improves as we use more human labels, the best
model has roughly the same performance as those
trained from distant labels (with or without human
labels). This suggests that the accuracy of human
labels is not substantially better than distant labels.

One database-corpus pair is used for training and the
other pair for testing. We evaluate the precision over
the 103 highest-probability predictions on the test
set. In Figure 5, we vary the size of the corpus in the
train pair and the number of human labels; the pre-

To study how a Web corpus impacts distant-
supervision quality, we select the first 100M English
webpages from the ClueWeb09 dataset and measure
how distant-supervision quality changes as we vary
the number of webpages used. As shown in Fig-
ure 6, increasing the corpus size improves F1 up to
107 docs (p = 0.05), while at 108 the two-tailed
significance test reports no significant impact on F1
(p = 0.05). The dip in precision in Figure 6 from
106 to either 107 or 108 is significant (p = 0.05),
and it is interesting future work to perform a de-
tailed error analysis. Recall from Section 3 that to
preprocess ClueWeb we use MaltParser instead of
Ensemble. Thus, the F1 scores in Figure 6 are not
comparable to those from the TAC training corpus.

5 Discussion and Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999940192307692">
We study how the size of two types of cheaply avail-
able resources impact the precision and recall of dis-
tant supervision: (1) an unlabeled text corpus from
which distantly labeled training examples can be ex-
tracted, and (2) crowd-sourced labels on training
examples. We found that text corpus size has a
stronger impact on precision and recall than human
feedback. We observed that distant-supervision sys-
tems are often recall gated; thus, to improve distant-
supervision quality, one should first try to enlarge
the input training corpus and then increase precision.
It was initially counter-intuitive to us that human
labels did not have a large impact on precision. One
reason is that human labels acquired from crowd-
sourcing have comparable noise level as distant la-
bels – as shown by Figure 4. Thus, techniques that
improve the accuracy of crowd-sourced answers are
an interesting direction for future work. We used a
particular form of human input (yes/no votes on dis-
tant labels) and a particular statistical model to in-
corporate this information (logistic regression). It
is interesting future work to study other types of
human input (e.g., new examples or features) and
more sophisticated techniques for incorporating hu-
man input, as well as machine learning methods that
explicitly model feature interactions.

<abstract confidence="0.999008227272727">Classically, training relation extractors relies on high-quality, manually annotated training data, which can be expensive to obtain. To mitigate this cost, NLU researchers have considered two newly available sources of less expensive (but potentially lower quality) labeled data from distant supervision and crowd sourcing. There is, however, no study comparing the relative impact of these two sources on the precision and recall of post-learning answers. To fill this gap, we empirically study how state-of-the-art techniques are affected by scaling these two sources. We use corpus sizes of up to 100 million documents and tens of thousands of crowd-source labeled examples. Our experiments show that increasing the corpus size for distant supervision has a statistically significant, positive impact on quality (F1 score). In contrast, human feedback has a positive and statistically significant, but lower, impact on precision and recall.</abstract>

Throughout this paper, it is important to understand the difference between mentions and entities. Entities are conceptual objects that exist in the world (e.g., Barack Obama), whereas authors use a variety of wordings to refer to (which we call “mention”) entities in text (Ji et al., 2010). 2 Related Work The idea of using entity-level structured data (e.g., facts in a database) to generate mention-level training data (e.g., in English text) is a classic one: researchers have used variants of this idea to extract entities of a certain type from webpages (Hearst, 1992; Brin, 1999). More closely related to relation extraction is the work of Lin and Patel (2001) that uses dependency paths to find answers that express the same relation as in a question. Since Mintz et al.

For example, distant supervision has been used for the TAC-KBP slot-filling tasks (Surdeanu et al., 2010) and other relation-extraction tasks (Hoffmann et al., 2010; Carlson et al., 2010; Nguyen and Moschitti, 2011a; Nguyen and Moschitti, 2011b).

After this stage, we have a well-defined machine learning problem that is solvable using standard supervised techniques. We use sparse logistic regression (i1 regularized) (Tibshirani, 1996), which is used in previous studies. Our feature extraction process consists of three steps: 7http://nlp.cs.qc.cuny.edu/kbp/2010/ 1. Run Stanford CoreNLP with POS tagging and named entity recognition (Finkel et al., 2005); 2.

Run a simple entity-linking system that utilizes NER results and string matching to identify mentions of Freebase entities (with types).9 The output of this processing is a repository of structured objects (with POS tags, dependency parse, and entity types and mentions) for sentences from the training corpus.

However, there has been no study on the impact of corpus size on distant supervision for relation extraction. Our goal is to fill this gap. Besides “big data,” another resource that may be valuable to distant supervision is crowdsourc825 Proceedings of the 50th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 825–834, Jeju, Republic of Korea, 8-14 July 2012. c�2012 Association for Computational Linguistics ing. For example, one could employ crowd workers to provide feedback on whether distant supervision examples are correct or not (Gormley et al., 2010). Intuitively the crowd workforce is a perfect fit for such tasks since many erroneous distant labels could be easily identified and corrected by humans. For example, distant supervision may mistakenly consider “Obama took a vacation in Hawaii” a positive example for birthPlace simply because a database says that Obama was born in Hawaii; a crowd worker would correctly point out that this sentence is not actually indicative of this relation. It is unclear however which strategy one should use: scaling the text corpus or the amount of human feedback. Our primary contribution is to empirically a</context>

Specifically, they address the noisy assumption that, if two entities participate in a relation in a knowledge base, then all co-occurrences of these entities express this relation. In contrast, we explore the effectiveness of increasing the training data sizes to improve distant-supervision quality. Sheng et al. (2008) and Gormley et al. (2010) study the quality-control issue for collecting training labels via crowdsourcing. Their focus is the collection process; in contrast, our goal is to quantify the impact of this additional data source on distantsupervision quality. Moreover, we experiment with one order of magnitude more human labels. Hoffmann et al. (2009) study how to acquire end-user feedback on relation-extraction results posted on an augmented Wikipedia site; it is interesting future work to integrate this source in our experiments.

To normalize, in both features we use lemmas instead of surface forms. We discard features that occur in fewer than three mention pairs. 3.3 Crowd-Sourced Data Crowd sourcing provides a cheap source of human labeling to improve the quality of our classifier. In this work, we specifically examine feedback on the result of distant supervision. Precisely, we construct the union of Ri U ... RN from Section 3.1. We then solicit human labeling from Mechanical Turk (MTurk) while applying state-of-the-art quality control protocols following Gormley et al. (2010) and those in the MTurk manual.10 These quality-control protocols are critical to ensure high quality: spamming is common on MTurk and some turkers may not be as proficient or careful as expected. To combat this, we replicate each question three times and, following Gormley 8We did not run Ensemble on ClueWeb because we had very few machines satisfying Ensemble’s memory requirement.

It is unclear however which strategy one should use: scaling the text corpus or the amount of human feedback. Our primary contribution is to empirically assess how scaling these inputs to distant supervision impacts its result quality. We study this question with input data sets that are orders of magnitude larger than those in prior work. While the largest corpus (Wikipedia and New York Times) employed by recent work on distant supervision (Mintz et al., 2009; Yao et al., 2010; Hoffmann et al., 2011) contain about 2M documents, we run experiments on a 100M-document (50X more) corpus drawn from ClueWeb.1 While prior work (Gormley et al., 2010) on crowdsourcing for distant supervision used thousands of human feedback units, we acquire tens of thousands of human-provided labels. Despite the large scale, we follow state-of-the-art distant supervision approaches and use deep linguistic features, e.g., part-of-speech tags and dependency parsing.2 Our experiments shed insight on the following two questions: 1.

The observation is that we are often able to obtain a structured, but incomplete, database D that instantiates relations of interest and a text corpus C that contains mentions of the entities in our database. Formally, a database is a tuple D = (E, R) where E is a set of entities and R = (Ri ..., RN) is a tuple of instantiated predicates. For example, Ri may contain pairs of married people.4 We use the facts in Ri combined with C to generate examples. Following recent work (Mintz et al., 2009; Yao et al., 2010; Hoffmann et al., 2011), we use Freebase5 as the knowledge base for seed facts. We use two text corpora: (1) the TAC-KBP6 2010 corpus that 4We only consider binary predicates in this work. 5http://freebase.com 6KBP stands for “Knowledge-Base Population.” 827 consists of 1.8M newswire and blog articles7, and (2) the ClueWeb09 corpus that is a 2009 snapshot of 500M webpages. We use the TAC-KBP slot filling task and select those TAC-KBP relations that are present in the Freebase schema as targets (20 relations on people and organization). One problem is that relations in D are defined at the entity level. Thus, the pai</context>

To generate training examples, we need to map the entities back to mentions in the corpus. We denote the relation that describes this mapping as the relation EL(e, m) where e E E is an entity in the database D and m is a mention in the corpus C. For each relation Ri, we generate a set of (noisy) positive examples denoted Rt defined as Ri = {(m1, m2) |R(e1, e2) n EL(e1, m1) n EL(e2, m2)} As in previous work, we impose the constraint that both mentions (m1, m2) E Ri are contained in the same sentence (Mintz et al., 2009; Yao et al., 2010; Hoffmann et al., 2011). To generate negative examples for each relation, we follow the assumption in Mintz et al. (2009) that relations are disjoint and sample from other relations, i.e., Rti = Uj#iR+ . 3.2 Feature Extraction Once we have constructed the set of possible mention pairs, the state-of-the-art technique to generate feature vectors uses linguistic tools such as partof-speech taggers, named-entity recognizers, dependency parsers, and string features. Following recent work on distant supervision (Mintz et al., 2009; Yao et al., 2010; Hoffmann et al., 2011), we use both lexical and syntactic features. After</context>

As a result, prior work mainly considers two types of evaluation methods: (1) randomly sample a small portion of predictions (e.g., top-k) and manually evaluate precision/recall; and (2) use a held-out portion of seed facts (usually Freebase) as a kind of “distant” ground truth. We replace manual evaluation with a standardized relation-extraction benchmark: TAC-KBP 2010. TAC-KBP asks for extractions of 46 relations on a given set of 100 entities. Interestingly, the Freebase held-out metric (Mintz et al., 2009; Yao et al., 2010; Hoffmann et al., 2011) turns out to be heavily biased toward distantly labeled data (e.g., increasing human feedback hurts precision; see Section 4.6). 4.2 Experimental Setup Our first group of experiments use the 1.8M-doc TAC-KBP corpus for training. We exclude from it the 33K documents that contain query entities in the TAC-KBP metrics. There are two key parameters: the corpus size (#docs) M and human feedback budget (#examples) N. We perform different levels of down-sampling on the training corpus. On TAC, we use subsets with M = 103,104,105, and 106 documents respectively. For each value of M, we perform 30 ind</context>

This suggests that the accuracy of human labels is not substantially better than distant labels. 4.6 Freebase Held-out Metric In addition to the TAC-KBP benchmark, we also follow prior work (Mintz et al., 2009; Yao et al., 2010; Hoffmann et al., 2011) and measure the quality using held-out data from Freebase. We randomly partition both Freebase and the corpus into two halves. One database-corpus pair is used for training and the other pair for testing. We evaluate the precision over the 103 highest-probability predictions on the test set. In Figure 5, we vary the size of the corpus in the train pair and the number of human labels; the precision reaches a dramatic peak when we the corpus size is above 105 and uses little human feedback.

Sample relations include people’s titles, birth places, and marriage relationships. Traditional relation-extraction systems rely on manual annotations or domain-specific rules provided by experts, both of which are scarce resources that are not portable across domains. To remedy these problems, recent years have seen interest in the distant supervision approach for relation extraction (Wu and Weld, 2007; Mintz et al., 2009). The input to distant supervision is a set of seed facts for the target relation together with an (unlabeled) text corpus, and the output is a set of (noisy) annotations that can be used by any machine learning technique to train a statistical model for the target relation. For example, given the target relation birthPlace(person, place) and a seed fact birthPlace(John, Springfield), the sentence “John and his wife were born in Springfield in 1946” (S1) would qualify as a positive training example. Distant supervision replaces the expensive process of manually acquiring annotations that is re</context>

The problem is that we lack the large amount of labeled examples that are typically required to apply supervised learning techniques. We describe an overview of these techniques and the methodological choices we made to implement our study. Figure 1 illustrates the overall workflow of a distant supervision system. At each step of the distant supervision process, we closely follow the recent literature (Mintz et al., 2009; Yao et al., 2010). 3.1 Distant Supervision Distant supervision compensates for a lack of training examples by generating what are known as silver-standard examples (Wu and Weld, 2007). The observation is that we are often able to obtain a structured, but incomplete, database D that instantiates relations of interest and a text corpus C that contains mentions of the entities in our database.

To generate training examples, we need to map the entities back to mentions in the corpus. We denote the relation that describes this mapping as the relation EL(e, m) where e E E is an entity in the database D and m is a mention in the corpus C. For each relation Ri, we generate a set of (noisy) positive examples denoted Rt defined as Ri = {(m1, m2) |R(e1, e2) n EL(e1, m1) n EL(e2, m2)} As in previous work, we impose the constraint that both mentions (m1, m2) E Ri are contained in the same sentence (Mintz et al., 2009; Yao et al., 2010; Hoffmann et al., 2011).

We only use answers from workers who display overall high consistency with the gold standard (i.e., correctly answering at least 80% of the gold-standard questions). 3.4 Statistical Modeling Issues Following Mintz et al. (2009), we use logistic regression classifiers to represent relation extractors. However, while Mintz et al. use a single multi-class classifier for all relations, Hoffman et al. (2011) and use an independent binary classifier for each individual relation; the intuition is that a pair of mentions (or entities) might participate in multiple target relations. We experimented with both protocols; since relation overlapping is rare for TAC-KBP and there was little difference in result quality, we focus on the binary-classification approach using training examples constructed as described in Section 3.1.</context>

Sample relations include people’s titles, birth places, and marriage relationships. Traditional relation-extraction systems rely on manual annotations or domain-specific rules provided by experts, both of which are scarce resources that are not portable across domains. To remedy these problems, recent years have seen interest in the distant supervision approach for relation extraction (Wu and Weld, 2007; Mintz et al., 2009). The input to distant supervision is a set of seed facts for the target relation together with an (unlabeled) text corpus, and the output is a set of (noisy) annotations that can be used by any machine learning technique to train a statistical model for the target relation. For example, given the target relation birthPlace(person, place) and a seed fact birthPlace(John, Springfield), the sentence “John and his wife were born in Springfield in 1946” (S1) would qualify as a positive training example. Distant supervision replaces the expensive process of manually acquiring a</context>

The problem is that we lack the large amount of labeled examples that are typically required to apply supervised learning techniques. We describe an overview of these techniques and the methodological choices we made to implement our study. Figure 1 illustrates the overall workflow of a distant supervision system. At each step of the distant supervision process, we closely follow the recent literature (Mintz et al., 2009; Yao et al., 2010). 3.1 Distant Supervision Distant supervision compensates for a lack of training examples by generating what are known as silver-standard examples (Wu and Weld, 2007). The observation is that we are often able to obtain a structured, but incomplete, database D that instantiates relations of interest and a text corpus C that contains mentions of the entities in our database. Formally, a database is a tuple D = (E, R) where E is a set of entities and R = (Ri ..., RN) is a tuple of instantiated predicates. For example, Ri may contain pairs of married people.4 We use the facts in Ri combined with C to generate examples. Following recent work (Mintz et al., 2009; Yao et al., 2010; Hoffmann et al., 2011), we use Freebase5 as the knowledge base for seed facts. We</context>

It is unclear however which strategy one should use: scaling the text corpus or the amount of human feedback. Our primary contribution is to empirically assess how scaling these inputs to distant supervision impacts its result quality. We study this question with input data sets that are orders of magnitude larger than those in prior work. While the largest corpus (Wikipedia and New York Times) employed by recent work on distant supervision (Mintz et al., 2009; Yao et al., 2010; Hoffmann et al., 2011) contain about 2M documents, we run experiments on a 100M-document (50X more) corpus drawn from ClueWeb.1 While prior work (Gormley et al., 2010) on crowdsourcing for distant supervision used thousands of human feedback units, we acquire tens of thousands of human-provided labels. Despite the large scale, we follow state-of-the-art distant supervision approaches and use deep linguistic features, e.g., part-of-speech tags and dependency parsing.2 Our experiments shed insight on the following two questions: 1.

To generate training examples, we need to map the entities back to mentions in the corpus. We denote the relation that describes this mapping as the relation EL(e, m) where e E E is an entity in the database D and m is a mention in the corpus C. For each relation Ri, we generate a set of (noisy) positive examples denoted Rt defined as Ri = {(m1, m2) |R(e1, e2) n EL(e1, m1) n EL(e2, m2)} As in previous work, we impose the constraint that both mentions (m1, m2) E Ri are contained in the same sentence (Mintz et al., 2009; Yao et al., 2010; Hoffmann et al., 2011). To generate negative examples for each relation, we follow the assumption in Mintz et al. (2009) that relations are disjoint and sample from other relations, i.e., Rti = Uj#iR+ . 3.2 Feature Extraction Once we have constructed the set of possible mention pairs, the state-of-the-art technique to generate feature vectors uses linguistic tools such as partof-speech taggers, named-entity recognizers, dependency parsers, and string features.

As a result, prior work mainly considers two types of evaluation methods: (1) randomly sample a small portion of predictions (e.g., top-k) and manually evaluate precision/recall; and (2) use a held-out portion of seed facts (usually Freebase) as a kind of “distant” ground truth. We replace manual evaluation with a standardized relation-extraction benchmark: TAC-KBP 2010. TAC-KBP asks for extractions of 46 relations on a given set of 100 entities. Interestingly, the Freebase held-out metric (Mintz et al., 2009; Yao et al., 2010; Hoffmann et al., 2011) turns out to be heavily biased toward distantly labeled data (e.g., increasing human feedback hurts precision; see Section 4.6). 4.2 Experimental Setup Our first group of experiments use the 1.8M-doc TAC-KBP corpus for training. We exclude from it the 33K documents that contain query entities in the TAC-KBP metrics. There are two key parameters: the corpus size (#docs) M and human feedback budget (#examples) N. We perform different levels of down-sampling on the training corpus. On TAC, we use subsets with M = 103,104,105, and 106 documents respectively. For each value</context>
<context position="27837" citStr="Yao et al., 2010" startWordPosition="4611" endWordPosition="4614">corpus. To assess the quality of human labels, we train extraction models with human labels only (on examples obtained from distant supervision). We vary the amount of human labels and plot the F1 changes in Figure 4. Although the F1 improves as we use more human labels, the best model has roughly the same performance as those trained from distant labels (with or without human labels). This suggests that the accuracy of human labels is not substantially better than distant labels. 4.6 Freebase Held-out Metric In addition to the TAC-KBP benchmark, we also follow prior work (Mintz et al., 2009; Yao et al., 2010; Hoffmann et al., 2011) and measure the quality using held-out data from Freebase. We randomly partition both Freebase and the corpus into two halves. One database-corpus pair is used for training and the other pair for testing. We evaluate the precision over the 103 highest-probability predictions on the test set. In Figure 5, we vary the size of the corpus in the train pair and the number of human labels; the precision reaches a dramatic peak when we the corpus size is above 105 and uses little human feedback. This suggests that this Freebase held-out metric is biased toward solely relying </context>
