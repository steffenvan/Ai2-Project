Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.979771193548387">
Electronic dictionaries covering all natural
language levels are very relevant for the hu-
man use as well as for the automatic
processing use, namely those constructed
with respect to international standards. Such
dictionaries are characterized by a complex
structure and an important access time when
using a querying system. However, the need
of a user is generally limited to a part of such
a dictionary according to his domain and ex-
pertise level which corresponds to a specia-
lized dictionary. Given the importance of
managing a unified dictionary and consider-
ing the personalized needs of users, we pro-
pose an approach for generating personalized
views starting from a normalized dictionary
with respect to Lexical Markup Framework
LMF-ISO 24613 norm. This approach pro-
vides the re-use of already defined views for
a community of users by managing their pro-
files information and promoting the materia-
lization of the generated views. It is com-
posed of four main steps: (i) the projection of
data categories controlled by a set of con-
straints (related to the user&apos;s profiles), (ii) the
selection of values with consistency check-
ing, (iii) the automatic generation of the
query&apos;s model and finally, (iv) the refinement
of the view. The proposed approach was con-
solidated by carrying out an experiment on an
LMF normalized Arabic dictionary.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999888078947368">
Electronic dictionaries are very useful in nowa-
days society, with the globalization and the in-
crease of world communication and exchanges.
There are clearly identified needs of dictionaries
for human use as well as for automatic processing
use.
Given the importance of having recourse to
standards when constructing such lexical re-
sources in order to promote the reuse and the fu-
sion, the standardization committee ISO
TC37/SC4 has recently validated the Lexical
Markup Framework norm (LMF) project under
the standard ISO 24 613 (Francopoulo and George
2008). LMF provides a common and shared repre-
sentation of lexical objects that allows for the en-
coding of rich linguistic information, including
among others morphological, syntactic, and se-
mantic aspects. The LMF proposal is distin-
guished by the separate management of the hierar-
chical data structure (meta-model) and elementary
linguistic descriptors (data categories) which pro-
motes to cover several languages.
A normalized dictionary covers wide areas that
include all lexical information of a given language
and which are useful both for human use and for
Natural Language Processing use in accordance
with the kind of the user (linguist, lexicographer,
developer, etc.), the level of the user (learner,
expert, etc.) and the domain of the use (linguistic,
medicine, biology, etc.). These dictionaries are
characterized by a complex structure that supports
the richness of natural languages. Therefore, deal-
ing with a unique and complete dictionary is well
for the manage task. However, such dictionaries
are large and can be time consuming when query-
ing their contents especially on the web. Moreo-
ver, displaying all details when some of which are
not useful for the field of the query research is a

nuisance for the user. So, it will be interesting to
reduce the displayed details according to the do-
main or to the expertise level of the user by gene-
rating personalized views (virtual or materialized)
in order to appropriate the use of such dictionaries
to the user needs.
The idea of creating document views is not a
new concept but applying it on LMF normalized
dictionaries is a new one. Indeed, it has been some
attempts for dictionary creating in accordance to
the TEI consortium (Véronis and Ide 1996) but the
problem was the fact that created textual views
(corresponding to the surface structure) or data
base views (corresponding to the deep structure)
were not customized. Others propositions are very
interesting but they concern the ontology domain
when dealing with the concept of point of view
(Corby and al 2005).
In this paper, we propose an approach that favors
the use of normalized dictionaries by generating
virtual/materialized personalized views. This ap-
proach is based on the profiles information asso-
ciated to user&apos;s community which helps to retrieve
already defined views stored in a library of views.
For the illustration, we use an Arabic LMF norma-
lized dictionary (Baccar and al. 2008, Khemak-
hem and al., 2009) developed in the framework of
an Arabic project supervised by the ALECSO
(The Arab League Educational, Cultural and
Scientific Organization) and founded by the Uni-
versity of King Abdul-Aziz in the Kingdom of
Saudi Arabia1. An environment supporting the
proposed approach was implemented. At present,
it concerns the Arabic language.
The present paper is outlined as follows. We will
start by giving an overview of projects that use
LMF notably for the construction and the exploi-
tation of electronic dictionaries. Then, we will
present the foundation of the proposed approach
related to the profile and the view concepts. After
that, we will explain the different steps of the
view&apos;s generating approach. Finally, we will bring
back the experimentation that we carried out on a
normalized Arabic dictionary using the proposed
approach.
2 State of the art of projects using LMF
After the emergence of LMF, some projects were
launched in order to construct or exploit electronic

dictionaries in accordance with this norm. Among
others we note LEXUS (Kirsch 2005) (Kemps-
Snijders and al 2006), LIRICS (LIRICS 2005) and
LMF-QL (Ben Abderrahmen and al 2007). All
these labors have been recourse to Web service
technology that favors to invoke, locally or afar,
appropriate services for the management or the
exploitation of a normalized dictionary.
LEXUS offers an interface permitting to the user
to define formats of lexical bases with a perspec-
tive to enable the construction of lexical bases ac-
cording to the LMF model. However, it does not
allow the verification of the compliance between
the model and the norm.
LIRICS proposes some APIs that focus especial-
ly on the management of lexical data base. These
APIs offer the possibility to work on the structure
of the LMF base by adding, modifying or deleting
components of LMF model. However, there is no
interface which facilitates the use of these APIs.
LMF-QL provides Web services to be used
while developing lingware systems. These servic-
es offer the exploitation of a normalized lexical
base without having any piece of information
about its content and its structure. The results of
these services may be personalized dictionaries
given in an XML format. However, it covers only
the morphological level.
Concerning the construction of personalized dic-
tionaries using the works mentioned above, we
can notice that the user must have an idea about
the content of the desired dictionary and its struc-
ture. He must also have acquaintances with que-
ries generation to satisfy his requirements.
Finally, we note an absence of works dealing
with the generation of views starting from LMF
standardized dictionary.

An electronic dictionary can be used by many us-
ers who have different requirements. Indeed, by
being a language learner, a researcher in linguis-
tics or a teacher&apos;s, needs and uses are not the
same. Therefore, it will be better to have a tool
(editor) allowing generating a suitable view. The
making of a view of the dictionary might be diffi-
cult for some kinds of users, so the recourse to
user profiles may facilitate this task. One can note
that the user profile is very important to guide the
user through the retrieval and the reuse of existent
views corresponding to his profile.

3.1 A user profile definition
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9996052">
Generally, all features characterizing a user or a
group of users can be grouped under the term of a
user profile. For electronic dictionaries, a user
profile is a dataset that concerns a community of
users of the dictionary.
Every profile is characterized by a category, a lev-
el of expertise and a field. Indeed, we classify the
views of the dictionary according to a profile that
is based on a selection of these three criteria. The
formal representation of a profile is the following:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.845666">
P : &lt; K, L, F&gt;
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9716295">
K: the kind of user: lexicographer, linguist, ling-
ware system developer, etc.
L: the level of the expertise: beginner, student,
expert, etc.
F: the field of user: medicine, sport, biology, gen-
eral, etc.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.996571">
3.2 A View definition
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9975825">
A view of a dictionary is a synthesis of a dictio-
nary interrogation query. We can consider it as a
specialized or lexical dictionary, supported by a
query.
A dictionary view allows to filter some lexico-
graphic information and to hide others that are
useless for some users.
The formal representation of a view:
</bodyText>
<construct confidence="0.487404625">
View : &lt; D, P, C &gt;
D: dictionary: each view is specific to a norma-
lized dictionary.
P: profile of the view (see previous section).
C: it is a set of properties which characterizes the
model of the view. Each property has the follow-
ing representation:
C : &lt;A, V, W&gt;
</construct>
<bodyText confidence="0.839054">
A: attribute is a simple representation of a charac-
teristic model. This characteristic may be a class
(Lemma, Sense...), a feature (definition, pos, ge-
nre,...) or a relationship (RelatedForm, SenseRe-
lation...) as indicated in Figure 3.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.992949909090909">
V: value: each attribute can have a set of values.
For example, the values verb and noun for the
attribute POS (Part Of Speech).
W: weight of a property. It may take the values 0
or 1.
• If the weight equals to 0, then this proper-
ty is mandatory only for part of the lexical
entry.
• If the weight equals to 1, then this proper-
ty is mandatory for each lexical entry of this
view.
</listItem>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.993405">
3.3 Different types of views
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998286">
There are two types of views:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.969453909090909">
• Virtual view: the results of this view are
calculated upon request. In this case, inter-
rogating queries of this view might generate
a composed query that interrogates directly
the principal dictionary (underlying).
• Materialized view (physical): a physical
copy faithful to the view definition which is
stored and maintained.
4 Proposed approach
In this section we describe the proposed approach
through the detail that we will give for each one of
its four steps. These steps are illustrated in Figure
1.
• Projection of the view model: includes the
specification of data categories (linguistic in-
formation), controlled by constraints in order
to build a suitable normalized and valid mod-
el. It can be started by already existing pro-
files.
• Selection and checkout of the coherence:
concerns the specification of some values for
data categories (DC) already specified. We
use coherence rules to check the constancy
knowing that there are strong dependencies
between some DCs and values of other DCs
(see section 4.2).
• Automatic generation of the model and the
query: includes the model refinement and the
checking of constraints by priority.
• Refinement of the view: involves the valida-
tion of a new view of dictionary, by adding
the elements that are related to the lexical en-
tries of this view.

4.1 Projection of the view model
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998765">
The UML model of the dictionary is difficult to
understand. So, we suggest a simpler represen-
tation which is more abstract. The choice can be
started by already existing profiles in order to
avoid views redundancy by the reuse of the pre-
vious ones and help users.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.711068">
a. The specification of a profile
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999995523809524">
A user profile is a description that corresponds
to a user community. We use the features of
profile to filter the DCs. Indeed, we offer to the
user only DCs that correspond to its field and its
level based on the weight assigned to each DC.
We assigned these weights according to a study
on the needs of each user level. This study is
based on the specific documents and dictiona-
ries for each user level. By example for begin-
ner level, we studied the school books to extract
the information (root, schema,...) needed at this
level.
It also facilitates and accelerates the task of
needs specification and permits to avoid views
redundancy. The projection phase is started by
the specification of the user profile that requires
the choice of its category, its level and its field.
Then, if the user wants to consult the previous
views of his profile, we display all the views
associated to this profile. Otherwise, we offer
the DCs specific to its field and its level.

model. So, the DC specification must be con-
trolled by constraints rules such as:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9940035">
• If we select the field, the semantic class or
the nature then the definition must be se-
lected.
• If the relation between syntactic behaviors
and senses is selected then the definition
must be selected.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.836028">
4.2 Selection and checkout of the cohe-
rence
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999931444444445">
Most of data categories use a list of values such
as part-of-speech (pos), scheme, field, etc. Val-
ues specification of some DCs might influence
the presence or the absence of the other DCs.
For example, if the user has chosen DCs: pos,
root, scheme, gender and number; then, he has
fixed the value du pos =”particle” (it means that
he needs only particles) and the value of the
number =”singular”. In this case, we note an
incoherence problem since the DC “number” is
among particles characteristics but it concerns
nouns. In this case, we must request the user to
rectify the specifications. The selection must
contain a checkout phase of coherence of DCs
specified with the already existing data in the
dictionary. This phase is based on coherence
rules which ensure consistency between DCs
and the specified values.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.5465135">
4.3 Automatic generation of the DTD and
the query
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999995529411765">
We use the Document Type Definition (DTD)
of the LMF norm and DC specifications of the
model to automatically generate the DTD of the
view. We use algorithms to generate DTD ele-
ments, respecting the order of the participating
classes and ensuring classes relations.
The automatic generation of the query (i.e. us-
ing XQuery) involves two steps: the first one
concern the specification of conditions for the
selection of a lexical entry and its related infor-
mation (i.e., semantic, syntactic). The second
step permits the definition of an XML represen-
tation of a lexical entry. This step is based on
the projection specified by the user and the
priority order of DCs. There are DCs that influ-
ence the presence of the lexical entry and others
that only influence the presence of the sense.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999235">
4.4 Refinement of the view
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999555">
The steps of this phase depend on the type of
the view. If it&apos;s a virtual one, then it&apos;s necessary
to save the query already generated. This query
will be used during the operation of this view. If
it&apos;s a materialized one, then query results are a
part of the dictionary and must be saved for the
operation of the view. The second case may
give us a non valid XML base, especially when
there are two lexical entries in relation and our
query will select one of them that have an iden-
tifier of the other entry that is not selected. We
recall that the lexical entries may have morpho-
logical links with other lexical entries and se-
mantic links with other senses.
Indeed, after recording query„s results, we
move to the step of refinement. This step con-
sists to valid the new personalized dictionary,
adding lexical entries, senses and syntactic
frame in relation with these results.

5.1 The normalized Arabic dictionary

<bodyText confidence="0.999981304347826">
In order to experiment our approach, we are
going to use the normalized Arabic interactive
dictionary containing more than 38000 lexical
entries and developed in the framework of an
Arabic project 2 supervised by the ALECSO.
This dictionary is modeled according to the me-
ta-model proposed by LMF3 (ISO 24613) and
uses data categories generated by the DCR4
norm (ISO 12620). The dictionary pattern is
composed of classes selected from the kernel or
from one of its extensions (morphological, se-
mantic, syntactic, MRD) in order to see a dic-
tionary covering most of new dictionary&apos;s needs
(Baccar and al 2008). Since there are many in-
formation that can be classified in multi exten-
sions in the same time, the norm&apos;s editor have
chosen to put them in one of these extensions.
For this reason, we did not use only Machine
Readable Dictionary (MRD) extension. This
pattern valorizes derivation phenomenon in
Arabic language and neutralizes the differences
between lexicographical schools, ensuring lan-
guage evolution. In fact, we have considered

and non-Arab origin words (رَتوُيْبْمَك “computer”,

<bodyText confidence="0.999964590909091">
The construction of specialized dictionaries is
an old concept. However, it has not been used
after the publication of LMF standard in spite of
the complexity and the richness of normalized
dictionaries. In this paper, we proposed an ap-
proach allowing the generation of specialized
and personalized views of dictionaries accord-
ing to users&apos; profiles in order to benefit from the
management of a unique dictionary and give
appropriate services.
A Practical experiment was carried out on a
normalized Arabic dictionary using an appro-
priate tool that permits to manage users&apos; profiles
and views&apos; generation. We successfully per-
formed some empirical illustrations starting
from the normalized dictionary.
In the future, we will consider the experimen-
tation of the developed tool in the generation of
various personalized views both in virtual and
materialized versions. Also, we plan to put up
our system on the Web. Also, we plan to expe-
riment our approach on others languages.

<abstract confidence="0.995279903225807">Electronic dictionaries covering all natural language levels are very relevant for the human use as well as for the automatic processing use, namely those constructed with respect to international standards. Such dictionaries are characterized by a complex structure and an important access time when using a querying system. However, the need of a user is generally limited to a part of such a dictionary according to his domain and expertise level which corresponds to a specialized dictionary. Given the importance of managing a unified dictionary and considering the personalized needs of users, we propose an approach for generating personalized views starting from a normalized dictionary with respect to Lexical Markup Framework LMF-ISO 24613 norm. This approach provides the re-use of already defined views for a community of users by managing their profiles information and promoting the materialization of the generated views. It is composed of four main steps: (i) the projection of data categories controlled by a set of con- (related to user&apos;s (ii) the selection of values with consistency checking, (iii) the automatic generation of the model finally, (iv) the refinement of the view. The proposed approach was consolidated by carrying out an experiment on an</abstract>

There are clearly identified needs of dictionaries for human use as well as for automatic processing use. Given the importance of having recourse to standards when constructing such lexical resources in order to promote the reuse and the fusion, the standardization committee ISO TC37/SC4 has recently validated the Lexical Markup Framework norm (LMF) project under the standard ISO 24 613 (Francopoulo and George 2008). LMF provides a common and shared representation of lexical objects that allows for the encoding of rich linguistic information, including among others morphological, syntactic, and semantic aspects. The LMF proposal is distinguished by the separate management of the hierarchical data structure (meta-model) and elementary linguistic descriptors (data categories) which promotes to cover several languages. A normalized dictionary covers wide areas that include all lexical information of a given language and which are useful both for human use and for Natural Language Processing use in accordanc</context>

So, it will be interesting to reduce the displayed details according to the domain or to the expertise level of the user by generating personalized views (virtual or materialized) in order to appropriate the use of such dictionaries to the user needs. The idea of creating document views is not a new concept but applying it on LMF normalized dictionaries is a new one. Indeed, it has been some attempts for dictionary creating in accordance to the TEI consortium (Véronis and Ide 1996) but the problem was the fact that created textual views (corresponding to the surface structure) or data base views (corresponding to the deep structure) were not customized. Others propositions are very interesting but they concern the ontology domain when dealing with the concept of point of view (Corby and al 2005). In this paper, we propose an approach that favors the use of normalized dictionaries by generating virtual/materialized personalized views.
