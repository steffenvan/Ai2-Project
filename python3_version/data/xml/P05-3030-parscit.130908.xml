We propose a method of organizing read-
ing materials for vocabulary learning. It
enables us to select a concise set of
reading texts (from a target corpus) that
contains all the target vocabulary to be
learned. We used a specialized vocab-
ulary for an English certification test as
the target vocabulary and used English
Wikipedia, a free-content encyclopedia, as
the target corpus. The organized reading
materials would enable learners not only
to study the target vocabulary efficiently
but also to gain a variety of knowledge
through reading. The reading materials
are available on our web site.

<bodyText confidence="0.999549181818182">
EFL (English as a foreign language) learners and
teachers can easily access a wide range of English
reading materials on the Internet. For example, cur-
rent news stories can be read on web sites such as
those for CNN,1 TIME,2 or the BBC.3 Specialized
reading materials for EFL learners are also provided
on web sites like EFL Reading.4
This situation, however, does not mean that EFL
learners and teachers can easily select proper texts
suited to their specific purposes, for example, learn-
ing vocabulary through reading. On the contrary,

EFL teachers have to carefully select texts, if they
want their students to learn a specialized vocabulary
through reading in a particular discipline such as
medicine, engineering, or economics. However, it is
problematic for teachers to select materials for learn-
ing a target vocabulary with short authentic texts.
It is possible to automate this selection process
given the target vocabulary to be learned and the tar-
get corpus from which texts are gathered (Utiyama
et al., 2004). In this research (Utiyama et al., 2004),
we used a specialized vocabulary for an English
certification test as the target vocabulary and used
newspaper articles from The Daily Yomiuri as the
target corpus. We then organized a set of reading
materials, which we called courseware5, using the
algorithm in Section 2. The courseware consisted
of 116 articles and contained all the target vocabu-
lary. We used the courseware in university English
classes from May 2004 to January 2005. We found
that the courseware was effective in learning vocab-
ulary (Tanimura and Utiyama, in preparation).
Based on the promising results, our next goal is
to distribute courseware (produced with our algo-
rithm) to EFL teachers and learners so that we can
receive wider feedback. To this end, the course-
ware we constructed (Utiyama et al., 2004) is inade-
quate because it was prepared from The Daily Yomi-
uri, which is copyrighted. We therefore replaced
The Daily Yomiuri with English Wikipedia,6 a free-
content encyclopedia, and developed new course-

<bodyText confidence="0.999955789473684">
We want to prepare efficient courseware for learning
a target vocabulary. We defined efficiency in terms
of the amount of reading materials that must be read
to learn a required vocabulary. That is, efficient
courseware is as short as possible, while containing
the required vocabulary. We used a greedy method
to develop the efficient courseware (Utiyama et al.,
2004).
Let C be the courseware under development and
V be the target vocabulary to be learned. We iter-
atively select a document (from the target corpus)
that has the largest number of new types8 (types con-
tained in V but not in C) and put it into C until C
covering all of V . “C covers all of V ” means that
each word in V occurs at least once in a document
in C.
More concretely, let Vtodo be the part of V not
covered by C, and let Vdone be V − Vtodo. We iter-
atively put document d into C that maximizes G(·),
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.993618142857143">
G(d|α, Vtodo, Vdone)
= αg(d|Vtodo) + (1 − α)g(d|Vdone), (1)
until C covers all of V . We then define g(·) as
g(d|V.)
k1 + 1 =|W(d) n V.|, (2)
k1((1 − b) + b |W (�)|
E(|W (·)|)) + 1
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.942612818181818">
where W (d) is the set of types in d, E(|W (·)|) is
the average for |W (·) |over the whole corpus, and
k1 and b are parameters that depend on the corpus.
We set k1 as 1.5 and b as 0.75. g(d|V,,) takes a large
value when there is a large number of common types
between W (d) and V,, and d is short. These effects
are due to |W (d)nV,, |and |W (�)|
E(|W (�)|) respectively. As
g(·) is based on the Okapi BM25 function (Robert-
son and Walker, 2000), which has been shown to be
quite efficient in information retrieval,9 we expected

occurrence of a type.

cient in information retrieval. Readers are referred to papers by

to the target vocabulary.
In Eq. (1), α is used to combine the scores of
document d, which are obtained by using Vtodo and

Vdone. It is defined as
α = |Vdone |(3)
1 + |Vdone|
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999612636363636">
This implies that even if |W(d) n Vtodo |is 1, it is
as important as |W (d) n Vdone |= |Vdone|. Con-
sequently, G(·) uses documents that have new types
of the given vocabulary in preference to documents
that have covered types.
To summarize, efficient courseware is constructed
by putting document d with maximum G(·) into C
until C covers all of V . This allows us to construct
efficient courseware because G(·) takes a large value
when a document has a large number of new types
and is short.

3.1 Vocabulary

<bodyText confidence="0.9997717">
We used the specialized vocabulary used in the
Test of English for International Communication
(TOEIC) because it is one of the most popular En-
glish certification tests in Japan. The vocabulary was
compiled by Chujo (2003) and Chujo et al. (2004),
who confirmed that the vocabulary was useful in
preparing for the TOEIC test. The vocabulary had
640 entries and we used 638 words from it that oc-
curred at least once in the corpus as the target vocab-
ulary.

<bodyText confidence="0.999981875">
We used articles from English Wikipedia as the tar-

anyone can edit. The version we used in this study
had 478,611 articles. From these, we first discarded
stub and other non-normal articles. We also dis-
carded short articles of less than 150 words. We then
selected 60,498 articles that were referred to (linked)
by more than 15 articles. This 15-link threshold was

we extracted a 150-word excerpt from the lead part
of each of these 60,498 articles to prepare the target
corpus. We set 150-word limit on an empirical basis
to reduce the burden imposed on learners. In short,
the target corpus consisted of 60,498 excerpts from
the English Wikipedia. In the rest of the paper, we
will use the term an article to refer to an excerpt that
was extracted according to this procedure.

Corporate finance

<bodyText confidence="0.9964692">
Corporate finance is the specific area of finance dealing with the fi-
nancial decisions corporations make, and the tools and analysis used
to make the decisions. The discipline as a whole may be divided between
long-term and short-term decisions and techniques. Both share the same
goal of enhancing firm value by ensuring that return on capital exceeds
cost of capital. Capital investment decisions comprise the long-term
choices about which projects receive investment, whether to finance that
investment with equity or debt, and when or whether to pay dividends to
shareholders. Short-term corporate finance decisions are called working
capital management and deal with balance of current assets and cur-
rent liabilities by managing cash, inventories, and short-term borrowing
and lending (e.g., the credit terms extended to customers). Corporate fi-
nance is closely related to managerial finance, which is slightly broader in
scope, describing the financial techniques available to all forms of busi-
ness ... (more)

The courseware consisted of 131 articles. Each
article was 150 words long because only excerpts
were used. The average number of tokens per ar-
ticle shared with the vocabulary (“num. of com-
mon tokens” in the Table) was 18.4 and that of
types (“num. of common types”) was 12.4. About
12.3%(= 18.4

course-1 to course-10. These 10 courses were obtained by re-
peatedly applying our algorithm to the English Wikipedia re-
moving articles included in earlier courses. The statistics pre-
sented in this paper were calculated from the first courseware,
course-1.
courseware was referred to by 70.7 articles on av-
erage as can be seen from the bottom row. Table

many target words and were heavily referred to by
other articles.

Figure 2 plots the increase in the number of cov-

were put into the courseware. The horizontal axis
represents the ranking of articles. The vertical axis
indicates the number of covered types. The increase
was sharpest when the ranking value was lowest (left
of figure). The dotted horizontal lines indicate 50%
and 90% of the target vocabulary. These lines cross
the curved solid line at the 22nd and 83rd articles,
i.e., 16.8% and 63.4% of the courseware, respec-
tively. This means that learners can learn most of the
target vocabulary from the beginning of the course-
ware. This is desirable because learners sometimes
do not have enough time to read all the courseware.

4 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999974818181818">
While many teachers agree that vocabulary learn-
ing can be fostered by presenting words in context
rather than isolating them from this, it is very dif-
ficult to prepare reading materials that contain the
specialized vocabulary to be learned. We have pro-
posed a method of automating this preparation pro-
cess (Utiyama et al., 2004). We have found that our
reading materials prepared from The Daily Yomiuri
were effective in vocabulary learning (Tanimura and
Utiyama, in preparation).
Our next goal is to distribute courseware (pro-
duced with our algorithm) to EFL teachers and
learners so that we can receive wider feedback. To
this end, we replaced The Daily Yomiuri, which
is copyrighted, with the English Wikipedia, which
is a free-content encyclopedia, and developed new
courseware whose statistics were presented and dis-
cussed in this paper. This courseware, which is
available on our web site, can be used to supplement
classroom learning activities as well as self-study.
We hope it will help EFL learners to learn and teach-
ers to teach a broader range of vocabulary.

As g(·) is based on the Okapi BM25 function (Robertson and Walker, 2000), which has been shown to be quite efficient in information retrieval,9 we expected 7http://www.kotonoba.net/˜mutiyama/vocabridge/ 8A type refers to a unique word, while a token refers to each occurrence of a type. 9BM25 and its variants have been proven to be quite efficient in information retrieval.

On the contrary, 1http://www.cnn.com/ 2http://www.time.com/time/ 3http://www.bbc.co.uk/ 4http://www.gradedreading.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/ EFL teachers have to carefully select texts, if they want their students to learn a specialized vocabulary through reading in a particular discipline such as medicine, engineering, or economics. However, it is problematic for teachers to select materials for learning a target vocabulary with short authentic texts. It is possible to automate this selection process given the target vocabulary to be learned and the target corpus from which texts are gathered (Utiyama et al., 2004). In this research (Utiyama et al., 2004), we used a specialized vocabulary for an English certification test as the target vocabulary and used newspaper articles from The Daily Yomiuri as the target corpus. We then organized a set of reading materials, which we called courseware5, using the algorithm in Section 2. The courseware consisted of 116 articles and contained all the target vocabulary. We used the courseware in university English classes from May 2004 to January 2005. We found that the courseware was effective in learning vocabulary (Tanimura and Utiyama, in preparation).

It is available on our web site.7 In the following, will we first summarize our algorithm and then describe details on the courseware we constructed from English Wikipedia. 2 Algorithm We want to prepare efficient courseware for learning a target vocabulary. We defined efficiency in terms of the amount of reading materials that must be read to learn a required vocabulary. That is, efficient courseware is as short as possible, while containing the required vocabulary. We used a greedy method to develop the efficient courseware (Utiyama et al., 2004). Let C be the courseware under development and V be the target vocabulary to be learned. We iteratively select a document (from the target corpus) that has the largest number of new types8 (types contained in V but not in C) and put it into C until C covering all of V . “C covers all of V ” means that each word in V occurs at least once in a document in C. More concretely, let Vtodo be the part of V not covered by C, and let Vdone be V − Vtodo. We iteratively put document d into C that maximizes G(·), G(d|α, Vtodo, Vdone) = αg(d|Vtodo) + (1 − α)g(d|Vdone), (1) until C covers all of V . We the</context>

We have proposed a method of automating this preparation process (Utiyama et al., 2004). We have found that our reading materials prepared from The Daily Yomiuri were effective in vocabulary learning (Tanimura and Utiyama, in preparation). Our next goal is to distribute courseware (produced with our algorithm) to EFL teachers and learners so that we can receive wider feedback. To this end, we replaced The Daily Yomiuri, which is copyrighted, with the English Wikipedia, which is a free-content encyclopedia, and developed new courseware whose statistics were presented and discussed in this paper. This courseware, which is available on our web site, can be used to supplement classr</context>
