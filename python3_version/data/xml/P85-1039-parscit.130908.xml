The desirability of a syntactic parsing com-
ponent in natural language understanding systems
has been the subject of debate for the past several
years. This paper describes an approach to auto-
matic text processing which is entirely based
on syntactic form. A program is described which
processes one genre of discourse, that of news-
paper reports. The program creates summaries of
reports by relying on an expanded concept of text
grounding: certain syntactic structures and tense/
aspect pairs indicate the most important events
in a news story. Supportive, background material
is also highly coded syntactically. Certain types
of information are routinely expressed with
distinct syntactic forms. Where more than one
episode occurs in a single report, a change of
episode will also be marked syntactically in a
reliable way.

The role that syntactic structure should play
in natural language processing has been a matter
of debate in computational linguistics. While
some researchers eschew syntactic processing as
giving a poor return on the heavy investment of a
parser (Schenk and Riesbeck, 1981), others make
syntactic representations the basis from which
further work is done (Sager, 1981; Hirschman and
Sager, 1982). Current syntax-based processors
tend to work only within a narrow semantic domain,
since they rely heavily on word co-occurrence
patterns which hold only within texts from a part-
icular sublanguage. Knowledge-based processors,
on the other hand, can operate on a less restricted
semantic field, but only if sufficient knowledge in
the form of scripts, frames, and so forth, is built
into the program.
This paper describes a syntactic approach to
natural language processing which is not bound to
a narrow semantic field, and which requires little
or no world knowledge. This approach has been
demonstrated in a computer program called DUMP
(Discourse Understanding Model Program), which
relies solely on syntactic structure to create
summaries of one particular genre of discourse--
that of newspaper reports--and to label the kinds
of information given in them (Decker, 1985). The
process for creating these summaries differs sub-
stantially from the word-list and statistical
methods used by other automatic abstractor programs
(Borko and Bernier, 1975). The DUMP program
therefore depends on a predictable discourse
genre or style, rather than a predictable sublang-
uage lexicon or body of world knowledge.
DUMP was developed from a corpus of over 5800
words representing twenty-three news reports from
three daily newspapers: the New York Times, the
Boston Globe, and the Providence Journal/Evening
Bulletin. With one exception, each story appeared
in the upper right-hand column of the front page.
The stories in the corpus were chosen randomly and
the only criterion for rejection was too large a
percentage of quoted material. Only the first two
hundred words or so of each story were included in
the corpus in order to allow a greater sampling
of reports. The discourse principles at work are
fairly represented in an excerpt of this length.
The input to the DUMP program consists of a
list of hand-wsed sentences making up each story.
/deally,.these parse trees should be the output of
a parsing program. In fact, about one-third of
the sentences were passed through the RUS parser
(Woods, 1973). RUS experienced difficulty with
some of these sentences for a number of reasons:
the parser was operating without a semantic compon-
ent, and arcs from nodes were ordered with the
expectation of feedback from semantics; RUS lacked
some rules for structures which appear with regul-
arity in the news; it attempted to give all the
parses of a sentence, where DUMP only required one,
and that not necessarily the correct or complete
one (about which more later); and DUMP&apos;s rules
call for certain syntactic labels which are not
ordinarily assigned by parsing programs (negative
and adversative clauses, for example). However,
it should be stressed that none of these difficul-
ties represents parsing problems of theoretical
import. All could be resolved by extensions to
existing components of the ATN and its dictionary.

THE DISCOURSE STRUCTURE OF NEWS REPORTS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.953514444444445">
The syntactic rules used by DUMP work because
of the predictable, almost formulaic discourse
structure of hard news reports*. Two journalistic
devices above all else characterize hard news:
the inverted pyramid, and the block paragraph
(Green, 1979). The inverted pyramid refers to the
convention of relating the most important facts of
* Features, sports reports, and so forth have their
own discourse structure.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.998535">

<bodyText confidence="0.998707238095239">
a news story in the first paragraph, followed by
less important information given in descending
order (or, it may be argued, random order) of im-
portance. Thus, the news differs markedly from
canonical story form in which material is given in
chronological order. The block paragraph, the
second device, is one which stands independent of
paragraphs adjacent to it. This unit contains no
logical connectives (however, in addition, more-
over) which link it to preceding or following
paragraphs. The avoidance of such connectives
allows the newspaper editor to quickly delete
paragraphs from a story in the morning edition
to fit into the evening edition without rewriting.
The block paragraph is short: over sixty percent
of the paragraphs in the corpus are only one sent-
ence long; about one-half have two sentences, and
less than one percent have three sentences. The
effect is that most sentences of the report are
presented at the same level of importance: there
is no orthographic unit larger than the sentence
which reliably indicates that a group of sentences
is related topically or episodically. In place of
the normal paragraph, we shall see, is a highly
reliable level of syntactic coding which links
sentences into episodes.
At a lower level of organization than the in-
verted pyramid and block paragraph are the two
discourse units which DUMP relies on: the episode,
and within the episode, the information field as
found in the detached clause.
News reports may contain more than one episode.
A new episode begins when the set of characters
and/or setting (temporal or geographical) changes.
The detached clause is defined intonationally:
it is bounded by pauses, has falling intonation
at the end, or is preceded by a clause with fall-
ing intonation (Thompson, 1983). This clause is
almost always set off in text with commas. So,
for example, the following sentence from the
ninth story in the corpus (&amp;quot;Arafat Forces Lose
Key Position,&amp;quot; Boston Globe, November 7, 1983)
consists of four detached clauses, or information
fields:
(9:3)* Arafat&apos;s soldiers, who resisted the
assault, fell back six miles to Beddawi,
the remaining PLO stronghold in the area,
and Nahr el Bared is now surrounded by Syrian
soldiers....
The information fields here are: a nonrestric-
tive relative clause (&amp;quot;who resisted the assault&amp;quot;),
an appositive (&amp;quot;the remaining PLO stronghold in
the area&amp;quot;), and two main clauses (&amp;quot;Arafat&apos;s
soldiers fell back...&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Nahr el Bared is now
surrounded...&amp;quot;).
There are a small number of syntactic forms
which reliably indicate the beginning of new
episodes. Likewise, there is a strong correlation
* The first number indicates the story in the
corpus, the second the number of the sentence
within that story.
between the category of information the journalist
conveys in each detached clause and the syntactic
structures used for its expression. For example,
the nonrestrictive relative clause in 9:3 expresses
background events, the appositive expresses an
identification of place, and the two main clauses
express a main event and a current state, respect-
ively. The next two sections will look at the
syntactic correlates of the information field and
the episode boundary in detail.
Syntactic Correlates of the Information Field
The syntactic rules used by DUMP reflect
grounding principles found universally in dis-
course (Grimes, 1975). Certain assertional struc-
tures in text deliver foreground information, which
tells the events of the narrative and moves the
story forward. These events comprise a summary of
the story. Less assertional structures are used to
express background, supportive information which
fleshes out the skeleton provided in the foreground
but does not move the action forward. There is a
strong correlation between the syntactic form and
information type of this supportive material which
allows DUMP to subcategorize it into the following
classes: past events and processes Leading up to
the most recent development in the story; plans for
the future; current state of the world; informa-
tion of secondary importance; identifications;
import of the story; effects of actions; comments
made by participants in the story; and collateral
(things which did not happen).
This division of material into foreground vs.
background gives text its texture. A narrative
in which everything is presented at the same level
of prominence tends to be monotonous. One of the
chief means of distinguishing foreground from
background is tense and aspect, which has been
called a sort of flow-of-control mechanism, allow-
ing the reader to pick out the most important parts
of a discourse (Hopper, 1979). Sentences with
simple past verbs in the active voice are the
chief conveyors of foreground material in news.
This fact recalls the broader concept of transi-
tivity put forth by Hopper and Thompson (1980),
whereby certain properties of the verb and its
arguments transfer the action from agent to patient
more effectively than others. Foregrounded clauses
have high transitivity, backgrounded clauses Low
transitivity.
High transitivity verbs are kinetic, telic,
punctual, volitional, affirmative, and realis.
Kinetic verbs allow easy transfer of action from
subject to object. Throw is therefore kinetic,
while the copular to be is not. Te1ic verbs are
those which express an action with a natural end-
point. The verb make in &amp;quot;John is making a chair&amp;quot;
is telic, while the verb Ilia in &amp;quot;John is singing&amp;quot;
is not. Telic and atelic verbs can be distin-
guisned by their entailments: if John is interrup-
ted while making a chair, it is not true that he
has made a chair, but if he is interrupted while
singing, it is still true that he has sung (Comrie,
1976). Punctual verbs (sneeze, kick) refer to
actions with no obvious internal structure.
Study and carry are examples of non-punctual verbs.

<bodyText confidence="0.984204504065041">
Volitional verbs (&amp;quot;I wrote his name&amp;quot;) have greater
transitivity than non-volitional verbs (&amp;quot;I forgot
his name&amp;quot;)(Hopper and Thompson, 1980, p. 252).
Affirmation distinguishes collateral information
from all other types. And finally, the realis
mode distinguishes events which have existed from
those which only might have or would have. Main
event clauses therefore never contain modals. The
differential behavior of verbs from these semantic
classes has been described by a number of taxon-
omers (Comrie, 1976; Mourelatos, 1981; Ota, 1963;
Vendler, 1967).
Arguments high in transitivity are those which
are strong agents, totally affected and highly
individuated. Strong agents are human rather than
non-human: &amp;quot;George startled me&amp;quot; has more transi-
tivity than &amp;quot;The picture startled me&amp;quot; (Hopper and
Thompson, 1980, p.252). Objects which are wholly
affected lend greater transitivity than those which
are only partially affected (&amp;quot;I drank the milk&amp;quot;
vs. &amp;quot;I drank some milk&amp;quot;). Likewise, more highly
individuated &apos;Meets, defined as proper, human or
animate, concrete, singular, count and definite,
add more transitivity than less individuated ones.
These transitivity parameters assume a good
deal of semantic knowledge about verbs and their
arguments. In fact, the affirmative and realis
features are the only ones reflected in DUMP&apos;s
rules. But in another respect, Hopper and Thomp-
son&apos;s notion of transitivity must be extended. An
examination of tense and aspect alone is not
sufficient to distinguish foreground from back-
ground in the DUMP corpus. The type of clause in
which the verb appears is also crucial. So, for
example, the simple past may be used to convey both
foreground and background material, depending on
the type of clause in which it occurs: in main
clauses, it will always convey the most recent
events in a story, while in relative clauses, it
will always convey past events. The first two
sentences of story 6 (&amp;quot;Stone Meets with Salvador
Rebel Official,&amp;quot; Boston Globe, August 1, 1983)
illustrate the distinct uses of the two clause
types.
(6:1) After weeks of maneuvering and frus-
tration, presidential envoy Richard B. Stone
met face-to-face yesterday for the first time
with a key leader of the Salvadoran guerrilla
movement.
Here, the simple past is used in a main clause to
foreground information.
(6:2) &amp;quot;The ice has been broken,&amp;quot; proclaimed
President Belisario Betancur of Colombia,
who engineered the meeting.
The simple past engineered in a relative clause
indicates background material.
The information-bearing capacities of these
two clause types, when they occur with the simple,
active past, are in complementary distribution in
newswriting. The main clause is more assertional
than the relative clause; it is used to give
information which the writer assumes the reader is
seeing for the first time. The relative clause,
on the other hand, is more presuppositional. The
writer uses it to convey old information which is
of lesser importance or which the reader may
already have knowledge of.
Sentences 6:1 and 6:2 illustrate the way in
which syntactic forms provide information which
might otherwise need to be culled from world know-
ledge. We know that the planning of a meeting pre-
cedes its occurrence, but no such knowledge is
necessary here, since the past verb form in a rel-
ative clause signals an event which occurred before
the main event.
The so-called &amp;quot;hot news&amp;quot; present perfect in a
main clause (&apos;The president has resigned&amp;quot;) signals
a main event if it occurs in the first sentence of
a story. Its appearance further down or in a non-
main clause signals information about past events
or states. Two sentences from story 16 (&amp;quot;Peron-
ists Suffer Stunning Defeat in Argentine Vote,&amp;quot;
New York Times, November 1, 1983) illustrate this.
(16:1) The leader of a middle-class party
has swept to victory in Argentina&apos;s presi-
dential elections....
(16:4) The e*ction, called by the ruling
military, was a stunning defeat for the
Peronists, who have dominated Argentina&apos;s
political life since their pa,.ty was founded
in 1945 by Juan Domingo Peron.
In 16:1, the present perfect has swept is used
in the hot news sense. In 16:4, the present per-
fect have dominated is used in a relative clause
with an adverbial phrase (&amp;quot;since their party was
founded in 1945...&amp;quot;) to describe a state that has
existed for decades. Note also that the verb
dominate is atelic and non-punctual, and therefore
low in transitivity. However, knowledge of the
verb&apos;s semantic class is not necessary to identify
the relative clause as supportive. The mere fact
that the verb is in a relative clause or the fact
that the present perfect appears after the first
sentence suffices.
Syntactic clues may be used to avoid the need
for time programs which determine the relative
timing of events by interpreting adverbials. The
following main clauses use the present perfect, but
since they are non-initial, the states and events
referred to in them must have occurred before the
main event in the story (&amp;quot;O&apos;Neill Now Calls Gren-
ada Invasion &apos;Justified&apos; Action,&amp;quot; New York Times,
November 9, 1983).
(19:5) Pressures to pass a strict 60-day
legal limit [to the stay of U.S. troops in
Grenada] have eased in the past week.
(19:6) Both houses have passed such measures,
but the Senate version has been bottled up
because it was attached to a debt-ceiling bill.
(19:7) Other versions of the 60-day War Powers
Resolution have been introduced but not acted
upon.
The appearance of the present perfect this far

<bodyText confidence="0.999101387931034">
into the story means that the time phrase in the
past week does not have to be interpreted by a time
program.
Likewise, the use of the passive simple past in
a main clause indicates that the event is supportive
material: main events, it turns out, are never
expressed with passive voice in the corpus. In
story 14 (&amp;quot;U.S. Says Moscow Threatens to Quit
Talks on Missiles,&amp;quot; New York Times, October 12,
1983), there is no need to interpret the adver-
bial in 1980 and in 1979 with a time program,
unless relative ordering of background events is
desired. The mere presence of the passive marks
these events as occurring &apos;wfore the time of
the main events in the story.
(14:8) Talks on a comprehensive test ban of
nuclear devices were suspended in Geneva
in 1980, and the Geneva negotiations were
suspended in 1979.
Main events then are expressed in main clauses
with simple past verbs. Events and states which
existed before these main events are expressed
with a greater variety of syntactic forms, from
main clauses, to relative and subordinate clauses,
down to noun phrases (which are not analyzed by
DUMP). Nominalizations are perhaps the most fre-
quent conveyors of background information in the
news. The nominalization rule transforms a sent-
ence into a noun phrase which can then be inserted
into another sentence. It Is a highly presupposi-
tional structure, since the subject and object
of the original verb are often deleted during the
transformation and the reader must then supply
these arguments from world knowledge. An example
from the second story in the corpus (&amp;quot;Lebanon
Needs Israeli Troops, Shultz Told,&amp;quot; Boston Globe,
March 14, 1983) shows the heavy use of nominali-
zations to create a very long prepositional phrase
which contains not a single verb:
(2:2) In the first high-level contacts
between the two governments since the start
early this year of US-Israeli-Lebanese
negotiations on the withdrawal of Israel&apos;s
forces from Lebanon,....
We will see other uses of nominalization to express
other information categories and to refer to
episodes with a single-word.
The following incomplete list gives a cursory
look at the strong correlation between the remain-
ing information categories in news reports and the
syntactic forms used to express them. Most of the
examples are from story 6, about envoy Stone&apos;s
meeting with a Salvadoran guerrilla leader, and
story 16, about the defeat of the Peronists in
Argentina&apos;s elections. The next two categories,
Current States and Plans, also locate events or
states in time, and therefore must occur in finite
clauses. -
Current States: This category describes the
state of the world at the time the report is
written. Current states are expressed with simple
present os present progressive verbs used in main
clauses and in subordinate and relative clauses.
(6:10) Stone has repeatedly sought to meet
with political leaders of the Salvadoran
left, all of whom live in exile,....
(16:11) The country Mr. Alfonsin is due
to govern is racked by a deep economic crisis.
Plans: These may be expressed with appropriate
modals (will, might, would) in the same struc-
tures used for Current States.
(6:10) His mission is to encourage participa-
tion by the left in Salvadoran elections,
which will probably be held in March 1984.
(16:10) Military officials said the ruling
junta would consider it in a meeting Tuesday.
Certain verbs which express present planning
(come, ,leave, start) can be used to indicate
future time with the present tense: &amp;quot;Fiscal year
1983, which begins Oct. 1....&amp;quot;.
It seems to be a discourse principle of jour-
nalese that while non-main events may be &amp;quot;promo-
ted&amp;quot; to expression by the most assertive clause
type, they may also be expressed with less asser-
tional forms: subordinate and relative clauses,
nominalizations, etc. The conversr, however, is
not true. Main events may never by &amp;quot;demoted&amp;quot; to
expression by any other than the most assertive
form.
The remaining information types do not locate
actions in time, and therefore are free to appear
in constructions without finite verbs.
Import: This category is occasionally
expressed with equative sentences of the form:
NP V-be NP. The subject and predicate NPs tend
to be nominalizations, with the former referring
to the main episode.
(16:4) The election.. .was a stunning defeat
for the Peronists....
Election refers to the main event introduced in
16:1. 16:4 tells why that event is newsworthy.
Nonrestrictive PPs with nominalizations as
heads may also express Import:
(4:1) The.. .Budget Committee, in a major
blow to President Ronald Reagan, voted
yesterday to hold the real growth in defense
spending to 5 percent next year.... (&amp;quot;Senate
Panel Trims Reagan Arms Budget,&amp;quot; Boston Globe,
April 8, 1983)
Identifications: With only one exception, all
identifications in the corpus are made with pre-
nominal modifiers (&amp;quot;Prime Minister Smith&amp;quot;) or
with appositives, which may be embedded recur-
sively:
(6:3) ...Stone...talked with Ruben Zamora,
the No. 2 leader of the Revolutionary Demo-

cratic Front, the.political arm of the five
Marxist-led guerrilla bands fighting gov-
ernment forces here.
Effects: Detached participial phrases are used
to tell the effects of the actions described in
main clauses.
(16:1) The leader of a middle-class party
has swept to victory in Argentina&apos;s presi-
dential elections, handing the union-based
Peronists their first election defeat in
nearly four decades.
Comments: Comments are simply quotations from
people involved in an event. While in other narra-
tives, dialogue is often the chief means of tell-
ing a story and moving the action forward, this is
not the case in newswriting. Here, quotes from
participants add flavor and give supplementary
information, but they are never the sole vehicle
for informing readers of an event. This is a
lucky fact, since the syntactic forms used in
quoted speech are usually much less constrained
than those in non-quoted portions.
(16:5) &amp;quot;We are entering a new stage,&amp;quot; the
56-year old Mr. Alfonsin, whose politics
are left of center, said in a television
interview early today.
Collateral: News reports tell what did not
happen in a story, what events and processes
never were, with surprising frequency. This
information category is expressed by negations of
clauses, including negative existentials, neg-
ative subordinate clauses, and various negative
prefixes and prenominal modifiers.
(6:7) Salvadoran officials had no immediate
comment on what they heard from Stone....
(6:9) Stone had been unable to arrange a
meeting with the Salvadoran rebel leaders...
earlier this month.
If it were the case that the correspondence
between a syntactic form and the information types
it expresses was one-to-many, this relation would
not be of much help in automatic processing. In
fact, the correspondence is closer to one-to-one,
so that, for example, equatives only express im-
port and not identifications, as would be natural
in conversational English (&amp;quot;Smith is mayor of the
city&amp;quot;).
DUMP was successful in creating good summaries
and labeling the information types for all but two
of the twenty-three stories in the corpus. These
two exceptions were highly eventful, chronological
accounts and DUMP had difficulty distinguishing
minor events from major ones. In addition, after
the completion of the program, it performed well
with a final story not from the corpus.
Syntactic Correlates of Episode Boundaries
About one-third of the stories in the DUMP
corpus consist of more than one episode. Story 17,
given here with its DUMP-derived analysis of infor-
mation, contains three minor episodes in addition
to the major one introduced in the first sentence
of the report. The discussion below of syntactic
forms used to indicate episode boundaries will
call upon this story for examples.

&amp;quot;Senate Approves Secret U.S. Action
Against Managua&amp;quot;

Special to the New York Times
Washington, Nov. 3 - 1. The Senate today
approved by voice vote continued aid for covert
operations in Nicaragua. 2. The approval was
made contingent upon notification to the intelli-
gence committee of the goals and risks of specific
covert projects.
3. The action would provide only $19 million
of the $50 million that the Administration sought
for covert operations in Central America, mostly
in Nicaragua. 4. Those funds are expected to run
out in less than six months, when the Central
Intelligence Agency would have to give an account
of its activities as it sought the rest of the
funds.
5. The vote followed an hourlong debate that
focused on covert United States activity in Nicar-
agua, which was banned in a House-passed bill.
6. The House bill would provide $50 million in open
assistance to any friendly Central American govern-
ment. 7. House and Senate conferees will now seek
to resolve differences in the two measures, and
the Nicaraguan dispute is expected to be a stumb-
ling block in the negotiations.

The remaining uncategorized sentences are
episode markers and will be discussed below.
As noted earlier, orthographic paragraphs are
not used in newswriting to indicate episode
boundaries. In their place are a small number of
constructions which regularly introduce new
episodes, relating them temporally to previous
episodes. These structures include the double
container sentence, the sentence introduced with
a non-restrictive location PP, the LinkS, and the
detached time adverbial with a nominalization in
it.
The first four sentences of story 17 concern
the matn episode. A new, minor episode is intro-
duced by the double container in sentence 5. This
kind of structure has a verb from the small class
(e.g. precede, follow, result in) which may take
a nominalization in both subject and object posi-
tion. The subject refers to an old episode and the
object to a new one.
(17:5) The vote followed an hourlong debate
that focused on covert United States
activity in Nicaragua....
The subject vote refers back to the story&apos;s
main event, the Senate vote in the first sentence.
The object, or new episode, is the nominalization
debate. The object also tells of another episode
concerning passage of a House bill. This bill

(17:8) In San Francisco, a Federal district
judge ordered Attorney General William French

of charges that President Reagan and other

This episode is not developed any further in
this report, but is interrupted in the next sent-

The nominalized subject refers back to a previous
episode and the object of came refers to a new
episode. The conjunct or preposition shows the new
episode&apos;s temporal relation to the old.
(17:9) The ruling came in a lawsuit filed
by Representative Ronald V. Dellums, Democrat
of California. (Page A9.I
The lawsuit episode is developed elsewhere in
the paper. The page reference closes this
episode, and therefore, since 17:10 contains no
reference to a new place or time, and has a simple
past main verb (told), it must by default be part
of the original, main episode. This decision is
supported by the eleventh sentence in the story
(not included in the corpus):
After this policy change, Mr. Moynihan said,
the committee approved additional funds.
There is no example of the final episode
marker in story 17--the sentence introduced by a
detached time adverbial with a nominalization in a
time phrase (&amp;quot;Two hours before the vote&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;During
the Pope&apos;s visit&amp;quot;). The nominalization refers to
a previous episode and the main sentence to which
the whole adverbial phrase is attached introduces
the new episode. Story 10 (&amp;quot;French Jets Retaliate,
Hit Shiite Positions,&amp;quot; Boston Globe, November 18,
1983) begins with French planes bombing Iranian-
backed militia in Lebanon. A related episode
starts in sentence 5:
(10:5) Six hours after the French air attacks,
gunmen fired rocket-propelled grenades and
automatic weapons at a French peacekeeping post
in the Shiite Moslem neighborhood of Khandik
Ghamik in West Beirut.
Each episode in a report has the potential to
contain its own main events, background events,
plans, current states, Identifications, and so
forth. An extension of DUMP&apos;s labeling ability
would be the creation of a discourse tree for each
news report, with a root node dominating episode
nodes, which in turn dominate relevant information
categories.

THE DUMP PROGRAM
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999959121212121">
DUMP works very simply. It takes as input
parsed sentences of a story and searches through
them for the kinds of syntactic labels described
above (declarative sentence, detached PP, etc.).
These labels introduce information fields, each of
which is stored on a stack. A set of rules is
then applied to each entry on the stack, and
assignment of each entry made to one of the
information categories on the basis of the struc-
tural label and optional tense/aspect marker.
DUMP does not need a full parse of a sentence
to assign syntactic structures to a particular
information category. For example, it does not
need to know anything about the attachment of
clause-internal PPs, a difficult problem for
parsing programs. Furthermore, newswriting (with
the exception of quoted portions, which DUMP does
not need parsed) does not reflect the use of a
full grammar of English. The corpus contains no
question forms and a number of the &amp;quot;stylistic&amp;quot;
transformations (pseudo-cleft, topicalization
are examples) do not appear. The question of
whether some kind of &amp;quot;fuzzy&amp;quot; parser with a limited
number of rules could provide adequate output for
DUMP is one for further research.
On the other hand, whatever parser is used to
prepare input for DUMP will need certain labels
not ordinarily found in parse trees: sentences are
not usually distinguished as equative or double
container in type. Furthermore, DUMP requires
some non-standard features on words. For example,
we have seen in a number of instances how crucial
it is to mark nouns as nominalizations.

RELATION TO OTHER WORK
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996179902173913">
The DUMP program embodies principles useful
both to the processing of sublanguages and to AI
research. In the former case, these principles
allow preliminary automatic processing of texts
within the same genre, regardless of the breadth
of the semantic field. As noted earlier, current
work with sublanguages relies on word co-occur-
rence classes which result from their very
constrained subject matter. Newswriting covers a
wide range of topics and therefore word co-occur-
rence classes are not an efficient method of
automatic processing. However, these reports do
show predictable constraints in the use of syn-
tactic constructions to express particular kinds
of information and it is this regularity that DUMP
depends upon.
In the case of Al research, DUMP can serve as
a support program to knowledge-based processors.
The FRUMP program (DeJong, 1979), for example,
creates summaries from sketchy scripts by looking
for key requests, or main events, in the text.
So, the script for an earthquake story might
contain key requests for information about the
quake&apos;s rating on the Richter Scale, the amount
of property damage it did, where the epicenter
was located, and how far shock waves were felt.
FRUMP would then look to the newspaper text for
evidence of each of the key requests in the script.
The scripts are written by the programmer, based
on his or her assumption of the most important
information likely to be found in all stories
about a particular topic. DUMP is freed from
reliance on such scripts because of the fact that
the news reporter, however unconsciously, encodes
key requests syntactically. DUMP can locate these
key requests easily and also signal the beginning
of new eipsodes, thus facilitating one of the tasks
which FRUMP finds most difficult--that of script
selection. (Imagine the confusion that could
result in story 17 when the Congressional script
is interrupted in the eighth sentence by an
episode requiring a judicial script.) Once all
of the detached clauses and episodes in a report
have been correctly labelled by DUMP, a knowledge-
based processor could then go about building
conceptual representations for each unit.
It is expected that DUZIP&apos;s approach could be
extended to other genres of writing, since most
texts achieve texture by distinguishing foreground
from background. However, texts vary in the pro-
portion of foregrounded to backgrounded material
and in their preference for certain forms to convey
grounding. The literary style of a discourse will
therefore influence the design of automatic text
processing programs. The style of news reports is
relatively subordinated, non-redundant, and predi-
cationally dense. The sentences in the DUMP corpus
average 2.88 predications per sentence, as compared
to a high of 2.78 in the informative sections of
the Brown corpus and 2.64 across all genres
(Francis and Kucera, 1982). The term predication
refers to both the finite and non-finite types, and
therefore the 2.88 figure indicates that the news
corpus is characterized by a great deal of embedd-
ing of both types: finite clauses (relative clauses,
adverbial clauses), and well as non-finites (infin-
itive complements, reduced relatives, participials).
It can be hypothesized that a highly predicated
writing style such as journalese will show greater
variety in its syntactic structures than a style
with few predications per sentence. This syntactic
diversity will reflect a text with less fore-
grounded material--in short, a text with greater
texture. A further hypothesis is that in a predi-
cationally dense style there will be a stronger
correlation between syntactic forms and the par-
ticular information types expressed by these forms.
It seems likely that a genre which uses few pred-
ications per sentence would consist chiefly of main
clauses used as the workhorse to express all kinds
of information: background, main events, plans,
import, and so forth. Some of these information
categories will be distinguishable by verb tense,
aspect, mood and voice, as in the news. But others
will have to rely on world knowledge for categori-
zation. As an example, consider a revised version
of the opening of story 6, rewritten so that em-
bedded clauses in the original are expressed as
main clauses:
Richard B. Stone met face-to-face today with
a key leader of the Salvadoran guerrilla
movement. He spent several frustrating weeks

maneuvering the meeting.
&amp;quot;The ice has been broken,&amp;quot; proclaimed
President Belisario Betancur of Colombia.
He engineered the meeting.
Knowledge about the way plans are made would be
needed to distinguish foreground from background in
these sentences.
One further metric can be hypothesized for
determining discourse genres suitable for syntactic
analysis. In syntactic theory there is a well-
known correlation between the flexibility of word
order in a language and its use of morphosyn-
tactic inflections. Languages like English which
have lost most of their inflectional markers rely
on rigid word order to establish syntactic
relations. On the other hand, highly inflected
languages like Latin can afford greater flexibility
in word order since inflections on the ends of
words indicate their function in the sentence.
An analogy might be drawn in which syntactic
structures correspond to morphosyntactic inflec-
tions and information order in discourse corres-
ponds to word order. The discourse structure of
news reports violates canonical story form. The
writer does not start at the beginning and relate
events through to the end. The potential confusion
introduced by this unpredictability is compounded
by the density of new information in news reports.
Perhaps the great regularity in the use of distinct
syntactic forms to express the types of information
conveyed in the news serves to compensate for the
flexibility in discourse structure. It is as
though the strong correlation between syntactic
form and information type frees the reader to
process the large amount of new information being
delivered. Just as inflectional endings allow the
listener to assign words to their functional slots
regardless of the order in which they appear, so
the syntactic correlates to information types allow
the news reader to quickly assign phrases their
function in the discourse. Stories which adhere
to a standard story grammar do not need such
syntactic regularity, since the position of the
material in the text indicates its function.
The extension of a program like DUMP to other
discourse genres would require, first, the
identification of the information categories
expressed by the kind of text. Cookbooks, for
example, convey instructions and descriptions, not
main events, effects and identifications.
Secondly, correlations between syntactic form and
information type and the syntactic means for
indicating episode boundaries must be determined.
The degree of correlation between syntactic form
and information type in non-news genres is a
matter for further investigation.

<abstract confidence="0.999407631578947">The desirability of a syntactic parsing component in natural language understanding systems has been the subject of debate for the past several years. This paper describes an approach to automatic text processing which is entirely based on syntactic form. A program is described which processes one genre of discourse, that of newspaper reports. The program creates summaries of reports by relying on an expanded concept of text grounding: certain syntactic structures and tense/ aspect pairs indicate the most important events in a news story. Supportive, background material is also highly coded syntactically. Certain types of information are routinely expressed with distinct syntactic forms. Where more than one episode occurs in a single report, a change of episode will also be marked syntactically in a reliable way.</abstract>

The next two sections will look at the syntactic correlates of the information field and the episode boundary in detail. Syntactic Correlates of the Information Field The syntactic rules used by DUMP reflect grounding principles found universally in discourse (Grimes, 1975). Certain assertional structures in text deliver foreground information, which tells the events of the narrative and moves the story forward. These events comprise a summary of the story. Less assertional structures are used to express background, supportive information which fleshes out the skeleton provided in the foreground but does not move the action forward.

Where more than one episode occurs in a single report, a change of episode will also be marked syntactically in a reliable way. INTRODUCTION The role that syntactic structure should play in natural language processing has been a matter of debate in computational linguistics. While some researchers eschew syntactic processing as giving a poor return on the heavy investment of a parser (Schenk and Riesbeck, 1981), others make syntactic representations the basis from which further work is done (Sager, 1981; Hirschman and Sager, 1982). Current syntax-based processors tend to work only within a narrow semantic domain, since they rely heavily on word co-occurrence patterns which hold only within texts from a particular sublanguage. Knowledge-based processors, on the other hand, can operate on a less restricted semantic field, but only if sufficient knowledge in the form of scripts, frames, and so forth, is built into the program. This paper describes a syntactic approach to natural language processing which is not bound to a narrow semantic field, and which requires little or no world knowledge.

This division of material into foreground vs. background gives text its texture. A narrative in which everything is presented at the same level of prominence tends to be monotonous. One of the chief means of distinguishing foreground from background is tense and aspect, which has been called a sort of flow-of-control mechanism, allowing the reader to pick out the most important parts of a discourse (Hopper, 1979). Sentences with simple past verbs in the active voice are the chief conveyors of foreground material in news. This fact recalls the broader concept of transitivity put forth by Hopper and Thompson (1980), whereby certain properties of the verb and its arguments transfer the action from agent to patient more effectively than others. Foregrounded clauses have high transitivity, backgrounded clauses Low transitivity. High transitivity verbs are kinetic, telic, punctual, volitional, affirmative, and realis.

Where more than one episode occurs in a single report, a change of episode will also be marked syntactically in a reliable way. INTRODUCTION The role that syntactic structure should play in natural language processing has been a matter of debate in computational linguistics. While some researchers eschew syntactic processing as giving a poor return on the heavy investment of a parser (Schenk and Riesbeck, 1981), others make syntactic representations the basis from which further work is done (Sager, 1981; Hirschman and Sager, 1982). Current syntax-based processors tend to work only within a narrow semantic domain, since they rely heavily on word co-occurrence patterns which hold only within texts from a particular sublanguage. Knowledge-based processors, on the other hand, can operate on a less restricted semantic field, but only if sufficient knowledge in the form of scripts, frames, and so forth, is built into the program. This paper describes a syntactic approach to natural language processing which is not bound to a narrow semantic field, and which requires little or no world knowledge. T</context>

At a lower level of organization than the inverted pyramid and block paragraph are the two discourse units which DUMP relies on: the episode, and within the episode, the information field as found in the detached clause. News reports may contain more than one episode. A new episode begins when the set of characters and/or setting (temporal or geographical) changes. The detached clause is defined intonationally: it is bounded by pauses, has falling intonation at the end, or is preceded by a clause with falling intonation (Thompson, 1983). This clause is almost always set off in text with commas. So, for example, the following sentence from the ninth story in the corpus (&amp;quot;Arafat Forces Lose Key Position,&amp;quot; Boston Globe, November 7, 1983) consists of four detached clauses, or information fields: (9:3)* Arafat&apos;s soldiers, who resisted the assault, fell back six miles to Beddawi, the remaining PLO stronghold in the area, and Nahr el Bared is now surrounded by Syrian soldiers.... The information fields here are: a nonrestrictive relative clause (&amp;quot;who resisted the assault&amp;quot;), an appositive (&amp;quot;the remaining PLO stronghold in the area&amp;quot;)</context>

The stories in the corpus were chosen randomly and the only criterion for rejection was too large a percentage of quoted material. Only the first two hundred words or so of each story were included in the corpus in order to allow a greater sampling of reports. The discourse principles at work are fairly represented in an excerpt of this length. The input to the DUMP program consists of a list of hand-wsed sentences making up each story. /deally,.these parse trees should be the output of a parsing program. In fact, about one-third of the sentences were passed through the RUS parser (Woods, 1973). RUS experienced difficulty with some of these sentences for a number of reasons: the parser was operating without a semantic component, and arcs from nodes were ordered with the expectation of feedback from semantics; RUS lacked some rules for structures which appear with regularity in the news; it attempted to give all the parses of a sentence, where DUMP only required one, and that not necessarily the correct or complete one (about which more later); and DUMP&apos;s rules call for certain syntactic labels which are not ordinarily assigned by parsing programs (negative and adversative clauses, f</context>
