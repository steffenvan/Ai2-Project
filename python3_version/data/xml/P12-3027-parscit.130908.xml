Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.998601307692308">
Writing in English might be one of the most
difficult tasks for EFL (English as a Foreign
Language) learners. This paper presents
FLOW, a writing assistance system. It is built
based on first-language-oriented input function
and context sensitive approach, aiming at
providing immediate and appropriate
suggestions including translations, paraphrases,
and n-grams during composing and revising
processes. FLOW is expected to help EFL
writers achieve their writing flow without being
interrupted by their insufficient lexical
knowledge.

1. Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999844705882353">
Writing in a second language (L2) is a challenging
and complex process for foreign language learners.
Insufficient lexical knowledge and limited
exposure to English might interrupt their writing
flow (Silva, 1993). Numerous writing instructions
have been proposed (Kroll, 1990) as well as
writing handbooks have been available for
learners. Studies have revealed that during the
writing process, EFL learners show the inclination
to rely on their native languages (Wolfersberger,
2003) to prevent a breakdown in the writing
process (Arndt, 1987; Cumming, 1989). However,
existing writing courses and instruction materials,
almost second-language-oriented, seem unable to
directly assist EFL writers while writing.
This paper presents FLOW1 (Figure 1), an
interactive system for assisting EFL writers in

composing and revising writing. Different from
existing tools, its context-sensitive and first-
language-oriented features enable EFL writers to
concentrate on their ideas and thoughts without
being hampered by the limited lexical resources.
Based on the studies that first language use can
positively affect second language composing,
FLOW attempts to meet such needs. Given any L1
input, FLOW displays appropriate suggestions
including translation, paraphrases, and n-grams
during composing and revising processes. We use
the following example sentences to illustrate these
two functionalities.
Consider the sentence “We propose a method
to”. During the composing stage, suppose a writer
is unsure of the phrase “solve the problem”, he
could write “解決問題”, a corresponding word in
his native language, like “We propose a method to
解決問題“. The writer’s input in the writing area
of FLOW actively triggers a set of translation
suggestions such as “solve the problem” and
“tackle the problem” for him/her to complete the
sentence.
In the revising stage, the writer intends to
improve or correct the content. He/She is likely to
change the sentence illustrated above into “We try
all means to solve the problem.” He would select
the phrase “propose a method” in the original
sentence and input a L1 phrase “盡力”, which
specifies the meaning he prefers. The L1 input
triggers a set of context-aware suggestions
corresponding to the translations such as “try our
best” and “do our best” rather than “try your best”
and “do your best”. The system is able to do that
mainly by taking a context-sensitive approach.
FLOW then inserts the phrase the writer selects
into the sentence.

In this paper, we propose a context-sensitive
disambiguation model which aims to automatically
choose the appropriate phrases in different contexts
when performing n-gram prediction, paraphrase
suggestion and translation tasks. As described in
(Carpuat and Wu, 2007), the disambiguation model
plays an important role in the machine translation
task. Similar to their work, we further integrate the
multi-word phrasal lexical disambiguation model
to the n-gram prediction model, paraphrase model
and translation model of our system. With the
phrasal disambiguation model, the output of the
system is sensitive to the context the writer is
working on. The context-sensitive feature helps
writers find the appropriate phrase while
composing and revising.
This paper is organized as follows. We review
the related work in the next section. In Section 3,
we brief our system and method. Section 4 reports
the evaluation results. We conclude this paper and
point out future directions to research in Section 5.

2.1 Sub-sentential paraphrases
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997898">
A variety of data-driven paraphrase extraction
techniques have been proposed in the literature.
One of the most popular methods leveraging
bilingual parallel corpora is proposed by Bannard
and Callison-Burch (2005). They identify
paraphrases using a phrase in another language as a
pivot. Using bilingual parallel corpora for
paraphrasing demonstrates the strength of semantic
equivalence. Another line of research further
considers context information to improve the
performance. Instead of addressing the issue of
local paraphrase acquisition, Max (2009) utilizes
the source and target contexts to extract sub-
sentential paraphrases by using pivot SMT
systems.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.994066">
2.2 N-gram suggestions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999892454545455">
After a survey of several existing writing tools, we
focus on reviewing two systems closely related to
our study.
PENS (Liu et al, 2000), a machine-aided English
writing system, provides translations of the
corresponding English words or phrases for
writers’ reference. Different from PENS, FLOW
further suggests paraphrases to help writers revise
their writing tasks. While revising, writers would
alter the use of language to express their thoughts.
The suggestions of paraphrases could meet their
need, and they can reproduce their thoughts more
fluently.
Another tool, TransType (Foster, 2002), a text
editor, provides translators with appropriate
translation suggestions utilizing trigram language
model. The differences between our system and
TransType lie in the purpose and the input. FLOW
aims to assist EFL writers whereas TransType is a
tool for skilled translators. On the other hand, in
TransType, the human translator types translation
of a given source text, whereas in FLOW the input,

2.3 Multi-word phrasal lexical disambiguation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999243285714286">
In the study more closely related to our work,
Carpuat and Wu (2007) propose a novel method to
train a phrasal lexical disambiguation model to
benefit translation candidates selection in machine
translation. They find a way to integrate the state-
of-the-art Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD)
model into phrase-based statistical machine
translation. Instead of using predefined senses
drawn from manually constructed sense
inventories, their model directly disambiguates
between all phrasal translation candidates seen
during SMT training. In this paper, we also use the
phrasal lexical disambiguation model; however,
apart from using disambiguation model to help
machine translation, we extend the disambiguation
model. With the help of the phrasal lexical
disambiguation model, we build three models: a
context-sensitive n-gram prediction model, a
paraphrase suggestion model, and a translation
model which are introduced in the following
sections.

3. Overview of FLOW
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994169">
The FLOW system helps language learners in two
ways: predicting n-grams in the composing stage
and suggesting paraphrases in the revising stage
(Figure 2).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.9602135">
3.1 System architecture
Composing Stage
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999597">
During the composing process, a user inputs S.
FLOW first determines if the last few words of S is
a L1 input. If not, FLOW takes the last k words to
predict the best matching following n-grams.
Otherwise, the system uses the last k words as the
query to predict the corresponding n-gram
translation. With a set of prediction (either
translations or n-grams), the user could choose an
appropriate suggestion to complete the sentence in
the writing area.

Revising Stage
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999978571428571">
In the revising stage, given an input I and the user
selected words K, FLOW obtains the word
sequences L and R surrounding K as reference for
prediction. Next, the system suggests sub-
sentential paraphrases for K based on the
information of L and R. The system then searches
and ranks the translations.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997192">
3.2 1-gram prediction
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997320740740741">
In the n-gram prediction task, our model takes the
last k words with m 2 English words and n foreign
language words, {e1, e2, ...em, f1, f2 ...fn}, of the
source sentences S as the input. The output would
be a set of n-gram predictions. These n-grams can
be concatenated to the end of the user-composed
sentence fluently.
Context-Sensitive 1-gram Prediction (CS-1P)
The CS-NP model is triggered to predict a
following n-gram when a user composes sentences
consisted of only English words with no foreign
language words, namely, n is equal to 0. The goal
of the CS-NP model is to find the English phrase e
that maximizes the language model probability of
the word sequence, {e1, e2, ...em, e}:
Translation-based 1-gram Prediction (TB-1P)
When a user types a set of L1 expression f = { f1, f2
...fn }, following the English sentences S, the
FLOW system will predict the possible translations
of f. A simple way to predict the translations is to
find the bilingual phrase alignments T(f) using the
method proposed by (Och and Ney, 2003).
However, the T(f) is ambiguous in different
contexts. Thus, we use the context {e1, e2, ...em}
proceeding f to fix the prediction of the translation.
Predicting the translation e can be treated as a sub-
sentential translation task:
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.505546">

</footnote>
<equation confidence="0.938369">
e = argmaxeET(f) P(ej el, e2,... em),
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999996357142857">
where we use the user-composed context {e1, e2,
...em} to disambiguate the translation of f.
Although there exist more sophisticated models
which could make a better prediction, a simple
naïve-Bayes model is shown to be accurate and
efficient in the lexical disambiguation task
according to (Yarowsky and Florian, 2002).
Therefore, in this paper, a naïve-Bayes model is
used to disambiguate the translation of f. In
addition to the context-word feature, we also use
the context-syntax feature, namely surrounding
POS tag Pos, to constrain the syntactic structure of
the prediction. The TB-NP model could be
represented in the following equation:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.976212333333333">
P(eIel, e2, ... em, pl, p2, ... Pm),
POS = {Pl, P2, ... lam}
According to the Bayes theorem,
P(eIel, e2, ... em, Pl, jl2, ... Pm)
= F1P(eiIe) * F1 P(pjIe)
eie&amp; peep
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999965666666667">
The probabilities can be estimated using a parallel
corpus, which is also used to obtain bilingual
phrase alignment.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998361">
3.3 Paraphrase Suggestion
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99993125">
Unlike the N-gram prediction, in the paraphrase
suggestion task, the user selects k words, {e1, e2,
...ek}, which he/she wants to paraphrase. The
model takes the m words {r1, r2, ...rm} and n words
{l1, l2, ...ln} in the right and left side of the user-
selected k words respectively. The system also
accepts an additional foreign language input, {f1,f2,
...fl}, which helps limit the meaning of suggested
paraphrases to what the user really wants. The
output would be a set of paraphrase suggestions
that the user-selected phrases can be replaced by
those paraphrases precisely.

pivot-based method proposed by Bannard and
Callison-Burch (2005). Although the pivot-based
method has been proved efficient and effective in
finding local paraphrases, the local paraphrase
suggestions may not fit different contexts. Similar
to the previous n-gram prediction task, we use the
naïve-Bayes approach to disambiguate these local
paraphrases. The task is to find the best e such that
e with the highest probability for the given context
R and L. We further require paraphrases to have
similar syntactic structures to the user-selected
phrase in terms of POS tags, Pos.

4. Experimental Results
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999007666666667">
In this section, we describe the experimental
setting and the preliminary results. Instead of
training a whole machine translation using toolkits
such as Moses (Koehn et. al, 2007), we used only
bilingual phrase alignment as translations to
prevent from the noise produced by the machine
translation decoder. Word alignments were
produced using Giza++ toolkit (Och and Ney,
2003), over a set of 2,220,570 Chinese-English
sentence pairs in Hong Kong Parallel Text
(LDC2004T08) with sentences segmented using
the CKIP Chinese word segmentation system (Ma
and Chen, 2003). In training the phrasal lexical
disambiguation model, we used the English part of
Hong Kong Parallel Text as our training data.
To assess the effectiveness of FLOW, we selected
10 Chinese sentences and asked two students to
translate the Chinese sentences to English
sentences using FLOW. We kept track of the
sentences the two students entered. Table 1 shows
the selected results.

Both of the paraphrase models CS-PS and TB-PS
perform quite well in assisting the user in the
writing task. However, there are still some
problems such as the redundancy suggestions, e.g.,
“look forward to” and “looked forward to”.
Besides, although we used the POS tags as
features, the syntactic structures of the suggestions
are still not consistent to an input or selected
phrases. The CS-NP and the TB-NP model also
perform a good task. However, the suggested
phrases are usually too short to be a semantic unit.
The disambiguation model tends to produce shorter
phrases because they have more common context
features.

5. Conclusion and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999985071428571">
In this paper, we presented FLOW, an interactive
writing assistance system, aimed at helping EFL
writers compose and revise without interrupting
their writing flow. First-language-oriented and
context-sensitive features are two main
contributions in this work. Based on the studies on
second language writing that EFL writers tend to
use their native language to produce texts and then
translate into English, the first-language-oriented
function provides writers with appropriate
translation suggestions. On the other hand, due to
the fact that selection of words or phrases is
sensitive to syntax and context, our system
provides suggestions depending on the contexts.
Both functions are expected to improve EFL
writers’ writing performance.
In future work, we will conduct experiments to
gain a deeper understanding of EFL writers’
writing improvement with the help of FLOW, such
as integrating FLOW into the writing courses to
observe the quality and quantity of students’
writing performance. Many other avenues exist for
future research and improvement of our system.
For example, we are interested in integrating the
error detection and correction functions into
FLOW to actively help EFL writers achieve better
writing success and further motivate EFL writers
to write with confidence.

Context-Sensitive Paraphrase Suggestion (CSPS) The CS-PS model first finds a set of local paraphrases P of the input phrase K using the e = argmax P(eIel, e2, ... em) e,Vm&lt;_k P(eIel, e2, ... em) = P(el, e2, ... em, e) P(el, e2, ... em) e* = argmax e 160 pivot-based method proposed by Bannard and Callison-Burch (2005). Although the pivot-based method has been proved efficient and effective in finding local paraphrases, the local paraphrase suggestions may not fit different contexts. Similar to the previous n-gram prediction task, we use the naïve-Bayes approach to disambiguate these local paraphrases. The task is to find the best e such that e with the highest probability for the given context R and L. We further require paraphrases to have similar syntactic structures to the user-selected phrase in terms of POS tags, Pos. ݁כ ൌ argmax ܲሺ݁|݈1, ݈2, ... ݈݊, ݎ1, ݎ2, ... ݎ݉, ܲݏሻ ఢ Translation-based Paraphras</context>

Screenshot of FLOW In this paper, we propose a context-sensitive disambiguation model which aims to automatically choose the appropriate phrases in different contexts when performing n-gram prediction, paraphrase suggestion and translation tasks. As described in (Carpuat and Wu, 2007), the disambiguation model plays an important role in the machine translation task. Similar to their work, we further integrate the multi-word phrasal lexical disambiguation model to the n-gram prediction model, paraphrase model and translation model of our system. With the phrasal disambiguation model, the output of the system is sensitive to the context the writer is working on. The context-sensitive feature helps writers find the appropriate phrase while composing and revising. This paper is organized as follows. We review the related work in the next section. In Section 3, we brief our sys</context>

The differences between our system and TransType lie in the purpose and the input. FLOW aims to assist EFL writers whereas TransType is a tool for skilled translators. On the other hand, in TransType, the human translator types translation of a given source text, whereas in FLOW the input, 158 either a word or a phrase, could be source or target languages. 2.3 Multi-word phrasal lexical disambiguation In the study more closely related to our work, Carpuat and Wu (2007) propose a novel method to train a phrasal lexical disambiguation model to benefit translation candidates selection in machine translation. They find a way to integrate the stateof-the-art Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) model into phrase-based statistical machine translation. Instead of using predefined senses drawn from manually constructed sense inventories, their model directly disambiguates between all phrasal translation candidates seen during SMT training. In this paper, we also use the phrasal lexical disambiguation model; however, apart from using disambiguation model to help machine </context>
