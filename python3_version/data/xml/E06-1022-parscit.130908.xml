We present results on addressee identifica-
tion in four-participants face-to-face meet-
ings using Bayesian Network and Naive
Bayes classifiers. First, we investigate
how well the addressee of a dialogue
act can be predicted based on gaze, ut-
terance and conversational context fea-
tures. Then, we explore whether informa-
tion about meeting context can aid classi-
fiers’ performances. Both classifiers per-
form the best when conversational context
and utterance features are combined with
speaker’s gaze information. The classifiers
show little gain from information about
meeting context.

Addressing is an aspect of every form of commu-
nication. It represents a form of orientation and
directionality of the act the current actor performs
toward the particular other(s) who are involved in
an interaction. In conversational communication
involving two participants, the hearer is always the
addressee of the speech act that the speaker per-
forms. Addressing, however, becomes a real issue
in multi-party conversation.
The concept of addressee as well as a vari-
ety of mechanisms that people use in addressing
their speech have been extensively investigated
by conversational analysts and social psycholo-
gists (Goffman, 1981a; Goodwin, 1981; Clark and
Carlson, 1982).
Recently, addressing has received consider-
able attention in modeling multi-party interac-
tion in various domains. Research on au-
tomatic addressee identification has been con-
ducted in the context of mixed human-human
and human-computer interaction (Bakx et al.,
2003; van Turnhout et al., 2005), human-human-
robot interaction (Katzenmaier et al., 2004), and
mixed human-agents and multi-agents interaction
(Traum, 2004). In the context of automatic anal-
ysis of multi-party face-to-face conversation, Ot-
suka et al. (2005) proposed a framework for
automating inference of conversational structure
that is defined in terms of conversational roles:
speaker, addressee and unaddressed participants.
In this paper, we focus on addressee identifica-
tion in a special type of communication, namely,
face-to-face meetings. Moreover, we restrict our
analysis to small group meetings with four partic-
ipants. Automatic analysis of recorded meetings
has become an emerging domain for a range of
research focusing on different aspects of interac-
tions among meeting participants. The outcomes
of this research should be combined in a targeted
application that would provide users with useful
information about meetings. For answering ques-
tions such as “Who was asked to prepare a presen-
tation for the next meeting?” or “Were there any
arguments between participants A and B?”, some
sort of understanding of dialogue structure is re-
quired. In addition to identification of dialogue
acts that participants perform in multi-party dia-
logues, identification of addressees of those acts is
also important for inferring dialogue structure.
There are many applications related to meeting
research that could benefit from studying address-
ing in human-human interactions. The results
can be used by those who develop communicative
agents in interactive intelligent environments and
remote meeting assistants. These agents need to
recognize when they are being addressed and how
they should address people in the environment.

fication in four-participants face-to-face meetings
using Bayesian Network and Naive Bayes classi-
fiers. The goals in the current paper are (1) to
find relevant features for addressee classification
in meeting conversations using information ob-
tained from multi-modal resources - gaze, speech
and conversational context, (2) to explore to what
extent the performances of classifiers can be im-
proved by combining different types of features
obtained from these resources, (3) to investigate
whether the information about meeting context
can aid the performances of classifiers, and (4) to
compare performances of the Bayesian Network
and Naive Bayes classifiers for the task of ad-
dressee prediction over various feature sets.

2 Addressing in face-to-face meetings
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997783456790124">
When a speaker contributes to the conversation, all
those participants who happen to be in perceptual
range of this event will have “some sort of partic-
ipation status relative to it”. The conversational
roles that the participants take in a given conversa-
tional situation make up the “participation frame-
work” (Goffman, 1981b).
Goffman (1976) distinguished three basic kinds
of hearers: those who overhear, whether or not
their unratified participation is unintentional or en-
couraged; those who are ratified but are not specif-
ically addressed by the speaker (also called unad-
dressed recipients (Goffman, 1981a)); and those
ratified participants who are addressed. Ratified
participants are those participants who are allowed
to take part in conversation. Regarding hearers’
roles in meetings, we are focused only on ratified
participants. Therefore, the problem of addressee
identification amounts to the problem of distin-
guishing addressed from unaddressed participants
for each dialogue act that speakers perform.
Goffman (1981a) defined addressees as those
“ratified participants () oriented to by the speaker
in a manner to suggest that his words are particu-
larly for them, and that some answer is therefore
anticipated from them, more so than from the other
ratified participants”. According to this, it is the
speaker who selects his addressee; the addressee is
the one who is expected by the speaker to react on
what the speaker says and to whom, therefore, the
speaker is giving primary attention in the present
act.
In meeting conversations, a speaker may ad-
dress his utterance to the whole group of partici-
pants present in the meeting, or to a particular sub-
group of them, or to a single participant in partic-
ular. A speaker can also just think aloud or mum-
ble to himself without really addressing anybody
(e.g.“What else do I want to say?” (while try-
ing to evoke more details about the issue that he is
presenting)). We excluded self-addressed speech
from our study.
Addressing behavior is behavior that speakers
show to express to whom they are addressing their
speech. It depends on the course of the conver-
sation, the status of attention of participants, their
current involvement in the discussion as well as
on what the participants know about each others’
roles and knowledge, whether explicit addressing
behavior is called for. Using a vocative is the ex-
plicit verbal way to address someone. In some
cases the speaker identifies the addressee of his
speech by looking at the addressee, sometimes ac-
companying this by deictic hand gestures. Ad-
dressees can also be designated by the manner of
speaking. For example, by whispering, a speaker
can select a single individual or a group of people
as addressees. Addressees are often designated by
the content of what is being said. For example,
when making the suggestion “We all have to de-
cide together about the design”, the speaker is ad-
dressing the whole group.
In meetings, people may perform various group
actions (termed as meeting actions) such as pre-
sentations, discussions or monologues (McCowan
et al., 2003). A type of group action that meeting
participants perform may influence the speaker’s
addressing behavior. For example, speakers may
show different behavior during a presentation than
during a discussion when addressing an individ-
ual: regardless of the fact that a speaker has
turned his back to a participant in the audience
during a presentation, he most probably addresses
his speech to the group including that participant,
whereas the same behavior during a discussion, in
many situations, indicates that that participant is
unaddressed.
In this paper, we focus on speech and gaze as-
pects of addressing behavior as well as on con-
textual aspects such as conversational history and
meeting actions.

3 Cues for addressee identification
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9938665">
In this section, we present our motivation for fea-
ture selection, referring also to some existing work

on the examination of cues that are relevant for ad-
dressee identification.
Adjacency pairs and addressing - Adjacency
pairs (AP) are minimal dialogic units that con-
sist of pairs of utterances called “first pair-part”
(or a-part) and the “second pair-part” (or b-part)
that are produced by different speakers. Examples
include question-answers or statement-agreement.
In the exploration of the conversational organiza-
tion, special attention has been given to the a-parts
that are used as one of the basic techniques for se-
lecting a next speaker (Sacks et al., 1974). For ad-
dressee identification, the main focus is on b-parts
and their addressees. It is to be expected that the
a-part provides a useful cue for identification of
addressee of the b-part (Galley et al., 2004). How-
ever, it does not imply that the speaker of the a-part
is always the addressee of the b-part. For example,
A can address a question to B, whereas B’s reply
to A’s question is addressed to the whole group. In
this case, the addressee of the b-part includes the
speaker of the a-part.
Dialogue acts and addressing When designing
an utterance, a speaker intends not only to per-
form a certain communicative act that contributes
to a coherent dialogue (in the literature referred
to as dialogue act), but also to perform that act to-
ward the particular others. Within a turn, a speaker
may perform several dialogue acts, each of those
having its own addressee ( e.g. I agree with you
[agreement; addressed to a previous speaker] but
is this what we want [information request; ad-
dressed to the group]). Dialogue act types can
provide useful information about addressing types
since some types of dialogue acts -such as agree-
ments or disagreements- tend to be addressed to
an individual rather than to a group. More infor-
mation about the addressee of a dialogue can be
induced by combining the dialogue act informa-
tion with some lexical markers that are used as ad-
dressee “indicators” (e.g. you, we, everybody, all
of you) (Jovanovic and op den Akker, 2004).
Gaze behavior and addressing Analyzing
dyadic conversations, researchers into social
interaction observed that gaze in social inter-
action is used for several purposes: to control
communication, to provide a visual feedback, to
communicate emotions and to communicate the
nature of relationships (Kendon, 1967; Argyle,
1969).
Recent studies into multi-party interaction em-
phasized the relevance of gaze as a means of ad-
dressing. Vertegaal (1998) investigated to what ex-
tent the focus of visual attention might function as
an indicator for the focus of “dialogic attention” in
four-participants face-to-face conversations. “Di-
alogic attention” refers to attention while listening
to a person as well as attention while talking to
one or more persons. Empirical findings show that
when a speaker is addressing an individual, there
is 77% chance that the gazed person is addressed.
When addressing a triad, speaker gaze seems to be
evenly distributed over the listeners in the situa-
tion where participants are seated around the ta-
ble. It is also shown that on average a speaker
spends significantly more time gazing at an indi-
vidual when addressing the whole group, than at
others when addressing a single individual. When
addressing an individual, people gaze 1.6 times
more while listening (62%) than while speaking
(40%). When addressing a triad the amount of
speaker gaze increases significantly to 59%. Ac-
cording to all these estimates, we can expect that
gaze directional cues are good indicators for ad-
dressee prediction.
However, these findings cannot be generalized
in the situations where some objects of interest are
present in the conversational environment, since
it is expected that the amount of time spent look-
ing at the persons will decrease significantly. As
shown in (Bakx et al., 2003), in a situation where
a user interacts with a multimodal information sys-
tem and in the meantime talks to another person,
the user looks most of the time at the system, both
when talking to the system (94%) and when talk-
ing to the user (57%). Also, another person looks
at the system in 60% of cases when talking to the
user. Bakx et al. (2003) also showed that some im-
provement in addressee detection can be achieved
by combining utterance duration with gaze.
In meeting conversations, the contribution of
the gaze direction to addressee prediction is also
affected by the current meeting activity and seat-
ing arrangement (Jovanovic and op den Akker,
2004). For example, when giving a presentation,
a speaker most probably addresses his speech to
the whole audience, although he may only look at
a single participant in the audience. A seating ar-
rangement determines a visible area for each meet-
ing participant. During a turn, a speaker mostly
looks at the participants who are in his visible area.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.990673">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999987785714286">
Moreover, the speaker frequently looks at a sin-
gle participant in his visual area when addressing
a group. However, when he wants to address a sin-
gle participant outside his visual area, he will often
turn his body and head toward that participant.
In this paper, we explored not only the effec-
tiveness of the speaker’s gaze direction, but also
the effectiveness of the listeners’ gaze directions
as cues for addressee prediction.
Meeting context and addressing As Goff-
man (1981a) has noted, “the notion of a conver-
sational encounter does not suffice in dealing with
the context in which words are spoken; a social
occasion involving a podium event or no speech
event at all may be involved, and in any case, the
whole social situation, the whole surround, must
always be considered”. A set of various meet-
ing actions that participants perform in meetings is
one aspect of the social situation that differentiates
meetings from other contexts of talk such as ordi-
nary conversations, interviews or trials. As noted
above, it influences addressing behavior as well
as the contribution of gaze to addressee identifi-
cation. Furthermore, distributions of addressing
types vary for different meeting actions. Clearly,
the percentage of the utterances addressed to the
whole group during a presentation is expected to
be much higher than during a discussion.

4 Data collection
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999808">
To train and test our classifiers, we used a small
multimodal corpus developed for studying ad-
dressing behavior in meetings (Jovanovic et al.,
2005). The corpus contains 12 meetings recorded
at the IDIAP smart meeting room in the research
program of the M41 and AMI projects2. The
room has been equipped with fully synchronized
multi-channel audio and video recording devices,
a whiteboard and a projector screen. The seating
arrangement includes two participants at each of
two opposite sides of the rectangular table. The
total amount of the recorded data is approximately
75 minutes. For experiments presented in this pa-
per, we have selected meetings from the M4 data
collection. These meetings are scripted in terms of
type and schedule of group actions, but content is
natural and unconstrained.
The meetings are manually annotated with dia-
logue acts, addressees, adjacency pairs and gaze

direction. Each type of annotation is described
in detail in (Jovanovic et al., 2005). Additionally,
the available annotations of meeting actions for the
M4 meetings3 were converted into the corpus for-
mat and included in the collection.
The dialogue act tag set employed for the cor-
pus creation is based on the MRDA (Meeting
Recorder Dialogue Act) tag set (Dhillon et al.,
2004). The MRDA tag set represents a modifi-
cation of the SWDB-DAMSL tag set (Jurafsky et
al., 1997) for an application to multi-party meet-
ing dialogues. The tag set used for the corpus cre-
ation is made by grouping the MRDA tags into 17
categories that are divided into seven groups: ac-
knowledgments/backchannels, statements, ques-
tions, responses, action motivators, checks and po-
liteness mechanisms. A mapping between this tag
set and the MRDA tag set is given in (Jovanovic
et al., 2005). Unlike MRDA where each utterance
is marked with a label made up of one or more
tags from the set, each utterance in the corpus is
marked as Unlabeled or with exactly one tag
from the set. Adjacency pairs are labeled by mark-
ing dialogue acts that occur as their a-part and b-
part.
Since all meetings in the corpus consist of four
participants, the addressee of a dialogue act is la-
beled as Unknown or with one of the following
addressee tags: individual Px, a subgroup of par-
ticipants Px,Py or the whole audience Px,Py,Pz.
Labeling gaze direction denotes labeling gazed
targets for each meeting participants. As the only
targets of interest for addressee identification are
meeting participants, the meetings were annotated
with the tag set that contains tags that are linked to
each participant Px and the NoTarget tag that is
used when the speaker does not look at any of the
participants.
Meetings are annotated with a set of six meet-
ing actions described in (McCowan et al., 2003):
monologue, presentation, white-board, discussion,
consensus, disagreement and note-taking.
Reliability of the annotation schema As re-
ported in (Jovanovic et al., 2005), gaze annota-
tion has been reproduced reliably (segmentation
80.40% (N=939); classification κ = 0.95). Table

In a dialogue situation, which is an event which
lasts as long as the dialogue act performed by the
speaker in that situation, the class variable is the
addressee of the dialogue act (ADD). Since there
are only a few instances of subgroup addressing in
the data, we removed them from the data set and
excluded all possible subgroups of meeting par-
ticipants from the set of class values. Therefore,
we define addressee classifiers to identify one of
the following class values: individual Px where
x E 10,1,2,31 and ALLP which denotes the whole
group.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997931">
5.2 Feature set
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999991375">
To identify the addressee of a dialogue act we
initially used three sorts of features: conversa-
tional context features (later referred to as contex-
tual features), utterance features and gaze features.
Additionally, we conducted experiments with an
extended feature set including a feature that con-
veys information about meeting context.
Contextual features provide information about
the preceding utterances. We experimented with
using information about the speaker, the addressee
and the dialogue act of the immediately preceding
utterance on the same or a different channel (SP-
1, ADD-1, DA-1) as well as information about
the related utterance (SP-R, ADD-R, DA-R). A re-
lated utterance is the utterance that is the a-part of
an adjacency pair with the current utterance as the
b-part. Information about the speaker of the cur-
rent utterance (SP) has also been included in the
contextual feature set.
As utterance features, we used a subset of lex-
ical features presented in (Jovanovic and op den
Akker, 2004) as useful cues for determining
whether the utterance is single or group addressed.
The subset includes the following features:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.971176444444445">
• does the utterance contain personal pronouns “we” or
“you”, both of them, or neither of them?
• does the utterance contain possessive pronouns or pos-
sessive adjectives (“your/yours” or “our/ours”), their
combination or neither of them?
• does the utterance contain indefinite pronouns such as
“somebody”, “someone”, “anybody”, “anyone”, “ev-
erybody” or “everyone”?
• does the utterance contain the name of participant Px?
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999842027027027">
Utterance features also include information about
the utterance’s conversational function (DA tag)
and information about utterance duration i.e.
whether the utterance is short or long. In our ex-
periments, an utterance is considered as a short ut-
terance, if its duration is less than or equal to 1
sec.
We experimented with a variety of gaze fea-
tures. In the first experiment, for each participant
Px we defined a set of features in the form Px-
looks-Py and Px-looks-NT where x,y E 10,1,2,31
and x 7� y; Px-looks-NT represents that partici-
pant Px does not look at any of the participants.
The value set represents the number of times that
speaker Px looks at Py or looks away during the
time span of the utterance: zero for 0, one for 1,
two for 2 and more for 3 or more times. In the
second experiment, we defined a feature set that
incorporates only information about gaze direction
of the current speaker (SP-looks-Px and SP-looks-
NT) with the same value set as in the first experi-
ment.
As to meeting context, we experimented with
different values of the feature that represents the
meeting actions (MA-TYPE). First, we used a full
set of speech based meeting actions that was ap-
plied for the manual annotation of the meetings in
the corpus: monologue, discussion, presentation,
white-board, consensus and disagreement. As the
results on modeling group actions in meetings pre-
sented in (McCowan et al., 2003) indicate that
consensus and disagreements were mostly mis-
classified as discussion, we have also conducted
experiments with a set of four values for MA-
TYPE, where consensus, disagreement and dis-
cussion meeting actions were grouped in one cat-
egory marked as discussion.

For learning the Bayesian Network structure,
we applied the K2 algorithm (Cooper and Her-
skovits, 1992). The algorithm requires an ordering
on the observable features; different ordering leads
to different network structures. We conducted ex-
periments with several orderings regarding feature
types as well as with different orderings regarding
features of the same type. The obtained classifi-
cation results for different orderings were nearly
identical. For learning conditional probability dis-
tributions, we used the algorithm implemented in
the WEKA toolbox4 that produces direct estimates
of the conditional probabilities.
5.3.1 Initial experiments without meeting
context
The performances of the classifiers are mea-
sured using different feature sets. First, we mea-
sured the performances of classifiers using utter-
ance features, gaze features and contextual fea-
tures separately. Then, we conducted experiments
with all possible combinations of different types of
features. For each classifier, we performed 10-fold
cross-validation. Table 3 summarizes the accura-
cies of the classifiers (with 95% confidence inter-
val) for different feature sets (1) using gaze infor-
mation of all meeting participants and (2) using
only information about speaker gaze direction.
The results show that the Bayesian Network
classifier outperforms the Naive Bayes classifier
for all feature sets, although the difference is sig-
nificant only for the feature sets that include con-
textual features.
For the feature set that contains only informa-
tion about gaze behavior combined with infor-
mation about the speaker (Gaze+SP), both clas-
sifiers perform significantly better when exploit-
ing gaze information of all meeting participants.

In other words, when using solely focus of visual
attention to identify the addressee of a dialogue
act, listeners’ focus of attention provides valuable
information for addressee prediction. The same
conclusion can be drawn when adding informa-
tion about utterance duration to the gaze feature
set (Gaze+SP+Short), although for the Bayesian
Network classifier the difference is not significant.
For all other feature sets, the classifiers do not per-
form significantly different when including or ex-
cluding the listeners gaze information. Even more,
both classifiers perform better using only speaker
gaze information in all cases except when com-
bined utterance and gaze features are exploited
(Utterance+Gaze+SP).
The Bayesian network and Naive Bayes clas-
sifiers show the same changes in the perfor-
mances over different feature sets. The re-
sults indicate that the selected utterance fea-
tures are less informative for addressee predic-
tion (BN:52.62%, NB:52.50%) compared to con-
textual features (BN:73.11%; NB:68.12%) or fea-
tures of gaze behavior (BN:66.45%, NB:64.53%).
The results also show that adding the informa-
tion about the utterance duration to the gaze fea-
tures, slightly increases the accuracies of the clas-
sifiers (BN:67.73%, NB:65.94%), which confirms
findings presented in (Bakx et al., 2003). Com-
bining the information from the gaze and speech
channels significantly improves the performances
of the classifiers (BN:70.68%; NB:69.78%) in
comparison to performances obtained from each
channel separately. Furthermore, higher accura-
cies are gained when adding contextual features to
the utterance features (BN:76.82%; NB:72.21%)
and even more to the features of gaze behavior
(BN:80.03%, NB:77.59%). As it is expected, the
best performances are achieved by combining all
three types of features (BN:82.59%, NB:78.49%),
although not significantly better compared to com-
bined contextual and gaze features.
We also explored how well the addressee can be
predicted excluding information about the related
utterance (i.e. AP information). The best perfor-
mances are achieved combining speaker gaze in-
formation with contextual and utterance features
(BN:79.39%; NB:76.06%). A small decrease in
the classification accuracies when excluding AP
information (about 3%) indicates that remaining
contextual, utterance and gaze features capture
most of the useful information provided by AP.

<bodyText confidence="0.999976157894737">
We presented results on addressee classification
in four-participants face-to-face meetings using
Bayesian Network and Naive Bayes classifiers.
The experiments presented should be seen as pre-
liminary explorations of appropriate features and
models for addressee identification in meetings.
We investigated how well the addressee of a di-
alogue act can be predicted (1) using utterance,
gaze and conversational context features alone as
well as (2) using various combinations of these
features. Regarding gaze features, classifiers’ per-
formances are measured using gaze directional
cues of the speaker only as well as of all meeting
participants. We found that contextual informa-
tion aids classifiers’ performances over gaze in-
formation as well as over utterance information.
Furthermore, the results indicate that selected ut-
terance features are the most unreliable cues for
addressee prediction. The listeners’ gaze direc-
tion provides useful information only in the situa-
tion where gaze features are used alone. Combina-
tions of features from various resources increases
classifiers’ performances in comparison to perfor-
mances obtained from each resource separately.
However, the highest accuracies for both classi-
fiers are reached by combining contextual and ut-
terance features with speaker’s gaze (BN:82.59%,
NB:78.49%). We have also explored the ef-
fect of meeting context on the classification task.
Surprisingly, addressee classifiers showed little
gain from the information about meeting actions
(BN:83.74%, NB:79.90%). For all feature sets,
the Bayesian Network classifier outperforms the
Naive Bayes classifier.
In contrast to Vertegaal (1998) and Otsuka et
al. (2005) findings, where it is shown that gaze
can be a good predictor for addressee in four-
participants face-to-face conversations, our results
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999991833333333">
show that in four-participants face-to-face meet-
ings, gaze is less effective as an addressee indi-
cator. This can be due to several reasons. First,
they used different seating arrangements which is
implicated in the organization of gaze. Second,
our meeting environment contains attentional ‘dis-
tracters’ such as whiteboard, projector screen and
notes. Finally, during a meeting, in contrast to an
ordinary conversation, participants perform vari-
ous meeting actions which may influence gaze as
an aspect of addressing behavior.
We will continue our work on addressee identi-
fication on the large AMI data collection that is
currently in production. The AMI corpus con-
tains more natural, scenario-based, meetings that
involve groups focused on the design of a TV re-
mote control. Some initial experiments on the
AMI pilot data show that additional challenges for
addressee identification on the AMI data are: roles
that participants play in the meetings (e.g. project
manager or marketing expert) and additional at-
tentional ‘distracters’ present in the meeting room
such as, the task object at first place and laptops.
This means that a richer feature set should be ex-
plored to improve classifiers’ performances on the
AMI data including, for example, the background
knowledge about participants’ roles. We will also
focus on the development of new models that bet-
ter handle conditional and contextual dependen-
cies among different types of features.

More information about the addressee of a dialogue can be induced by combining the dialogue act information with some lexical markers that are used as addressee “indicators” (e.g. you, we, everybody, all of you) (Jovanovic and op den Akker, 2004). Gaze behavior and addressing Analyzing dyadic conversations, researchers into social interaction observed that gaze in social interaction is used for several purposes: to control communication, to provide a visual feedback, to communicate emotions and to communicate the nature of relationships (Kendon, 1967; Argyle, 1969). Recent studies into multi-party interaction emphasized the relevance of gaze as a means of addressing. Vertegaal (1998) investigated to what extent the focus of visual attention might function as an indicator for the focus of “dialogic attention” in four-participants face-to-face conversations. “Dialogic attention” refers to attention while listening to a person as well as attention while talking to one or more persons. Empirical findings show that when a speaker is addressing an individual, there is 77% chance that the gazed person is addressed. When addressing a triad, speaker gaze seems t</context>

The algorithm requires an ordering on the observable features; different ordering leads to different network structures. We conducted experiments with several orderings regarding feature types as well as with different orderings regarding features of the same type. The obtained classification results for different orderings were nearly identical.

Additionally, the available annotations of meeting actions for the M4 meetings3 were converted into the corpus format and included in the collection. The dialogue act tag set employed for the corpus creation is based on the MRDA (Meeting Recorder Dialogue Act) tag set (Dhillon et al., 2004). The MRDA tag set represents a modification of the SWDB-DAMSL tag set (Jurafsky et al., 1997) for an application to multi-party meeting dialogues. The tag set used for the corpus creation is made by grouping the MRDA tags into 17 categories that are divided into seven groups: acknowledgments/backchannels, statements, questions, responses, action motivators, checks and politeness mechanisms. A mapping between this tag set and the MRDA tag set is given in (Jovanovic et al., 2005).

In this paper, we explored not only the effectiveness of the speaker’s gaze direction, but also the effectiveness of the listeners’ gaze directions as cues for addressee prediction. Meeting context and addressing As Goffman (1981a) has noted, “the notion of a conversational encounter does not suffice in dealing with the context in which words are spoken; a social occasion involving a podium event or no speech event at all may be involved, and in any case, the whole social situation, the whole surround, must always be considered”. A set of various meeting actions that participants perform in meetings is one aspect of the social situation that differentiates meetings from other contexts of talk such as ordinary conversations, interviews or trials.

Meeting context and addressing As Goffman (1981a) has noted, “the notion of a conversational encounter does not suffice in dealing with the context in which words are spoken; a social occasion involving a podium event or no speech event at all may be involved, and in any case, the whole social situation, the whole surround, must always be considered”. A set of various meeting actions that participants perform in meetings is one aspect of the social situation that differentiates meetings from other contexts of talk such as ordinary conversations, interviews or trials. As noted above, it influences addressing behavior as well as the contribu</context>

It represents a form of orientation and directionality of the act the current actor performs toward the particular other(s) who are involved in an interaction. In conversational communication involving two participants, the hearer is always the addressee of the speech act that the speaker performs. Addressing, however, becomes a real issue in multi-party conversation. The concept of addressee as well as a variety of mechanisms that people use in addressing their speech have been extensively investigated by conversational analysts and social psychologists (Goffman, 1981a; Goodwin, 1981; Clark and Carlson, 1982). Recently, addressing has received considerable attention in modeling multi-party interaction in various domains. Research on automatic addressee identification has been conducted in the context of mixed human-human and human-computer interaction (Bakx et al., 2003; van Turnhout et al., 2005), human-humanrobot interaction (Katzenmaier et al., 2004), and mixed human-agents and multi-agents interaction (Traum, 2004).

Additionally, the available annotations of meeting actions for the M4 meetings3 were converted into the corpus format and included in the collection. The dialogue act tag set employed for the corpus creation is based on the MRDA (Meeting Recorder Dialogue Act) tag set (Dhillon et al., 2004). The MRDA tag set represents a modification of the SWDB-DAMSL tag set (Jurafsky et al., 1997) for an application to multi-party meeting dialogues. The tag set used for the corpus creation is made by grouping the MRDA tags into 17 categories that are divided into seven groups: acknowledgments/backchannels, statements, questions, responses, action motivators, checks and politeness mechanisms. A mapping between this tag set and the MRDA tag set is given in (Jovanovic et al., 2005). Unlike MRDA where each utterance is marked with a label made up of one or more tags from the set, each utterance in the corpus is marked as Unlabeled or with exactly one tag from the set.

More information about the addressee of a dialogue can be induced by combining the dialogue act information with some lexical markers that are used as addressee “indicators” (e.g. you, we, everybody, all of you) (Jovanovic and op den Akker, 2004). Gaze behavior and addressing Analyzing dyadic conversations, researchers into social interaction observed that gaze in social interaction is used for several purposes: to control communication, to provide a visual feedback, to communicate emotions and to communicate the nature of relationships (Kendon, 1967; Argyle, 1969). Recent studies into multi-party interaction emphasized the relevance of gaze as a means of addressing. Vertegaal (1998) investigated to what extent the focus of visual attention might function as an indicator for the focus of “dialogic attention” in four-participants face-to-face conversations. “Dialogic attention” refers to attention while listening to a person as well as attention while talking to one or more persons.

Addressees can also be designated by the manner of speaking. For example, by whispering, a speaker can select a single individual or a group of people as addressees. Addressees are often designated by the content of what is being said. For example, when making the suggestion “We all have to decide together about the design”, the speaker is addressing the whole group. In meetings, people may perform various group actions (termed as meeting actions) such as presentations, discussions or monologues (McCowan et al., 2003). A type of group action that meeting participants perform may influence the speaker’s addressing behavior. For example, speakers may show different behavior during a presentation than during a discussion when addressing an individual: regardless of the fact that a speaker has turned his back to a participant in the audience during a presentation, he most probably addresses his speech to the group including that participant, whereas the same behavior during a discussion, in many situations, indicates that that participant is unaddressed.

Labeling gaze direction denotes labeling gazed targets for each meeting participants. As the only targets of interest for addressee identification are meeting participants, the meetings were annotated with the tag set that contains tags that are linked to each participant Px and the NoTarget tag that is used when the speaker does not look at any of the participants. Meetings are annotated with a set of six meeting actions described in (McCowan et al., 2003): monologue, presentation, white-board, discussion, consensus, disagreement and note-taking. Reliability of the annotation schema As reported in (Jovanovic et al., 2005), gaze annotation has been reproduced reliably (segmentation 80.40% (N=939); classification κ = 0.95).

As to meeting context, we experimented with different values of the feature that represents the meeting actions (MA-TYPE). First, we used a full set of speech based meeting actions that was applied for the manual annotation of the meetings in the corpus: monologue, discussion, presentation, white-board, consensus and disagreement. As the results on modeling group actions in meetings presented in (McCowan et al., 2003) indicate that consensus and disagreements were mostly misclassified as discussion, we have also conducted experiments with a set of four values for MATYPE, where consensus, disagreement and discussion meeting actions were grouped in one category marked as discussion. 173 5.3 Results and Discussions To train and test the addressee classifiers, we used the hand-annotated M4 data from the corpus.

Adjacency pairs and addressing - Adjacency pairs (AP) are minimal dialogic units that consist of pairs of utterances called “first pair-part” (or a-part) and the “second pair-part” (or b-part) that are produced by different speakers. Examples include question-answers or statement-agreement. In the exploration of the conversational organization, special attention has been given to the a-parts that are used as one of the basic techniques for selecting a next speaker (Sacks et al., 1974). For addressee identification, the main focus is on b-parts and their addressees. It is to be expected that the a-part provides a useful cue for identification of addressee of the b-part (Galley et al., 2004). However, it does not imply that the speaker of the a-part is always the addressee of the b-part. For example, A can address a question to B, whereas B’s reply to A’s question is addressed to the whole group. In this case, the addressee of the b-part includes the speaker of the a-part.
