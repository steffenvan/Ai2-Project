Dialect groupings can be discovered ob-
jectively and automatically by cluster
analysis of phonetic transcriptions such
as those found in a. linguistic atlas. The
first step in the analysis, the computa-
tion of linguistic distance. between each
pair of sites, can be computed as Leven-
shtein distance between phonetic strings.
This correlates closely with the much
more laborious technique of determining
and counting isoglosses, and is more ac-
curate than the more familiar metric of
computing Hamming distance based on
whether vocabulary entries match. In
the actual clustering step, traditional ag-
glomerative clustering works better than
the top-down technique of partitioning
around medoids. When agglomerative
clustering of phonetic string comparison
distances is applied to Gaelic, reasonable
dialect boundaries are obtained, corre-
sponding to national and (within Ire-
land) provincial boundaries.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.982695375">
Defining dialects is one of the first tasks that lin-
guists need to pursue when approaching a lan-
guage. Knowing the dialect areas helps one allo-
cate resources in language research and has impli-
cations for language learners, publishers, broad-
casters, educators, and language planners. Un-
fortunately, dialect definition can be a time-
consuming and ill-defined process. The traditional
approach has been to plot isoglosses, delineating
regions where the same word is used for the same
concept, or perhaps the same pronunciation for
the same phoneme. But isoglosses are frustrat-
ing. The first problem, as Gaston Paris noted
(apud Durand, 1889:49), is that isoglosses rarely
coincide. At best, isoglosses for different features
approach each other, forming vague bundles; at
*I thank Martin Kay, Paul Kiparsky, Tom Wasow,
and a reviewer for helpful comments.
worst, isoglosses may cut across each other, de-
scribing completely contradictory binary divisions
of the dialect area. That is, language may vary ge-
ographically in many dimensions, but the require-
ments we usually impose require that a specific
site be placed in a unique dialect. Traditional di-
alectological methodology gives little guidance as
to how to perform such reduction to one dimen-
sion.
A second problem is that many isoglosses do not
neatly bisect the language area. Often variants
do not neatly line up on two sides of a line, but
are intermixed haphazardly. More importantly,
for some sites information may be lacking, or the
question is simply not applicable. When compar-
ing how various sites pronounce the first conso-
nant of a particular word, it is meaningless to ask
that question if the site does not use that word. So
the isogloss is incomplete and cannot be meaning-
fully compared with isoglosses based on different
sets of sites.
The third problem is that most languages have
dialect continua, such that the speech of one com-
munity differs little from the speech of its neigh-
bours. Even though the cumulative effects of such
differences may be great when one considers the
ends of the continua (such as southern Italian ver-
sus northern French), still it seems arbitrary to
draw major dialect boundaries between two vil-
lages with very similar speech patterns. Such co-
nundrums led Paris and others to conclude that
the dialect boundary, and therefore the very no-
tion of dialect, is an ill-defined concept.
More recently, the field of dialectometry, as in-
troduced by Seguy (1971, 1973), has addressed
these issues by developing several techniques for
summarizing and presenting variation along mul-
tiple dimensions. They replace isoglosses with a
distance matrix, which compares each site directly
with all other sites, ultimately yielding a single
figure that measures the linguistic distances be-
tween each pair of sites. There is however no firm
agreement on just how to compute the distance
matrices. Seguy&apos;s earliest work (1971) was based
on lexical correspondences: sites differed in the
extent to which they used different words for the
</bodyText>

same concept. Seguy (1973), Philps (1987), and
Durand (1989) use some combination of lexical,
phonological, and morphological data. Babitch
(1988) described the dialectal distances in Aca-
dian villages by the degree to which their fishing
terminology varied. Babitch and Lebrun (1989)
did a similar analysis based on the varying pro-
nunciation of /r/. Elsie (1986) grouped the Gaelic
dialects on the basis of whether the vocabulary
matched. Ebobisse (1989) grouped the Sawabantu
languages of Cameroon by whether phonologi-
cal correspondences in matching vocabulary items
were complete, partial, or lacking. There seems to
be a certain bias in favour of working with lexical
correspondences, which is understandable, since
deciding whether two sites use the same word for
the same concept is perhaps one of the easiest lin-
guistic judgements to make. The need to figure
out such systems as the comparative phonology of
various linguistic sites can be very time-consuming
and fraught with arbitrary choices.
Not all dialectometrists agree on the wisdom of
delineating dialect areas. Seguy (1973:18) insisted
that the concept of dialect boundaries was mean-
ingless, and his emphasis on the gradience of lan-
guage similarity has been widely maintained. But
those who do look for firm dialect affiliations (such
as Babitch and Ebobisse) use bottom-up agglom-
erative techniques. The two linguistically closest
sites are grouped into one dialect, and thence-
forth treated as a unit. The process continues
recursively until all sites are grouped into one su-
perdialect embracing the entire language area un-
der consideration. This yields a binary tree. But
Kaufman and Rousseeuw (1990:44) suggest that
when the emphasis in a clustering problem is on
the top-level clusters—here, finding the two main
dialects—then such bottom-up methods, which
can potentially introduce error at each of several
steps, are less reliable than top-down partitioning
methods. Perhaps past researchers have used in-
ferior bottom-up techniques simply because the
necessary algorithms are computationally more
tractable. Comparing all possible pairs of sites is a
0(N2) problem,&apos; whereas considering all possible
two-way partitions of the dialect area is 0(2&amp;quot;).
The current state of dialectometry thus presents
two main questions which constitute the method-
ological focus of this paper. The first deals with
distance matrices. Is there a way to build ac-
curate distance matrices that minimize editorial
decisions without discarding relevant data? My
research suggests that this may be done by us-
ing string distances computed directly on pho-
netic transcriptions, and that this is better than
restricting the study to lexical comparisons. The
second deals with clustering. Do bottom-up or
&apos;The overall algorithm is 0(N3) since for each neW
group one must compute the distances between it and
each of the other sites or groups.
top-down techniques work best? My conclusion
is that the traditional bottom-up technique works
better than a typical top-down method. These
conclusions are based partly on an analysis of
the mathematical properties of the clusters them-
selves, partly on how well they correlate with
analyses based on more traditional isogloss tech-
niques, and partly on how well they compare with
previously-published descriptions of dialects in a
specific language, Irish Gaelic.
At one time the Gaelic language group was spo-
ken throughout Ireland, from where it spread to
the Isle of Man and to much of Scotland. Cur-
rently fully native use of Gaelic is limited to a few
discontiguous areas in the westernmost reaches of
Ireland and Scotland. In the case of Ireland, ev-
eryone agrees that Gaelic is nowadays found in
three main dialects: that of Ulster, that of Con-
nacht, and that of Munster (6 Siadhail, 1989).
But several questions are raised that are less eas-
ily answered. Do the three provinces separate out
so neatly for intrinsic linguistic reasons, or simply
because their speakers have become so widely sep-
arated from each other geographically as speakers
in intervening areas have adopted English? Does
the language of Connacht naturally group with
that of Ulster or with that of Munster? And look-
ing beyond Ireland, many have commented that
the language of Ulster in general is similar to that
of Scotland. Are Irish, Manx, and Scottish Gaelic
considered three separate languages for intrinsic
linguistic reasons, or because they are spoken in
different countries? To a large extent, dialectolo-
gists have found these questions difficult to an-
swer .because they accepted Paris&apos;s conundrum.
For 0 Siadhail, the ultimate scientific justifica-
tion in adopting the three-dialect account is the
fact that the Gael tacit (Irish-speaking territory)
is so fragmented nowadays that it no longer forms
a continuum. 0 Cuiv (1951:4-49) felt that. there
can be no dialect boundaries because transitions
are gradual. Elsie (1986:240) considers a dialect to
be an area where all communities are linguistically
more similar to each other than any community is
to any site outside the dialect. Such notions pro-
vide a very firm, absolute notion of dialecthood:
a set of communities either constitutes a dialect
area, or it does not. But as the dialectometrists
have shown, other notions of clustering are equally
scientific and may more accurately correspond to
intuitive notions of what it means to be a dialect.

had not spoken Irish since their youth. The at-
las is therefore an approximate reconstruction of
the linguistic landscape of the turn of the century,
when the Gaeltacht was more continuous. Wag-
ner also presents material from the Isle of Man and
seven sites in Scotland. The mapped entries are
presented in a very narrow phonetic transcription
based on the International Phonetic Alphabet.
Volume 1 of Wagner 1958 consists of 300 maps,
plotting about 370 concepts. I used the first 51
concepts, or about 4500 different string tokens, as
part of an ongoing project to enter all of the atlas
into machine readable format. These 51 concepts
were represented by 312 different Gaelic words or
phrases, whose stems derived from 171 different
etymons.

3 Methodology and results

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999202">
3.1 Distance matrices
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99991331">
To form a baseline for comparison, I analysed the
distribution of each of the 51 plotted concepts,
finding a total of 3,337 features by which two or
more sites differed. For example, for the concept
&apos;sell&apos;, I identified two sets, one using the word
diol (most sites in Ireland), and one using the
word creic (Rathlin Island, the Isle of Man, and
Scotland). The dialects partitioned in a different
way according to how much stress they placed on
the verb relative to the pronoun in &apos;I sold&apos; (even
stress in Dunlewy and four of the Scottish sites,
else extra stress on the verb). Not all partitions
covered the entire map. In this example, only
sites that used the word diol were compared on
the basis of whether a schwa developed in the se-
quence [i:1]. In some cases the divisions were more
than two-way: for example, Wagner distinguishes
whether the final consonant in creic is unpalatal-
ized, palatalized, or slightly palatalized. Distance
between sites was determined by counting 0 when-
ever two sites were in the same set and 1 whenever
two sites were in contrasting sets, then taking the
mean. This baseline approach corresponds for-
mally to determining distance by the number of
isoglosses that separate sites, which is in principle
the traditional technique.
This baseline was compared to several other ap-
proaches. The etymon identity metric averaged
the number of times the sites agreed in using
words whose stem had the same ultimate deriva-
tion. For example, the dialects differed as to
whether they used some form of bull- or damh-
for the word &apos;bullock&apos;. Etymon identity is one
of the more common approaches in dialectom-
etry; Elsie for example used it in his study of
the Gaelic dialects (1986). Closely related is the
idea of word identity, where the words are not
counted the same unless all of their morphemes
agree. In this analysis, sites that used some form
of the word bulldn, with the suffix -cin, were dis-
tinguished from those using the suffix -e.g.
Another set of approaches for computing dis-
tance was based on the phonetics. This com-
puted the Levenshtein distance between phonetic
strings. The Levenshtein distance is the cost of
the least expensive set of insertions, deletions, or
substitutions that would be needed to transform
one string into the other (Sankoff and Kruskal,
1983). The simplest technique used was phone
string comparison. In this approach, all opera-
tions cost 1 unit. Thus in comparing the forms
[AL:i] and [aid] for eallaigh &apos;cattle&apos;, the (minimal)
distance was 2, for the substitutions [a]/[A] and
HALL (For this measure, diacritics such as the
length mark `:&apos; were counted as part of the letter,
and different diacritics were adjudged to make for
different letters.) A pair of unrelated words like
[AL:i] and [khruh] (for crodh, another word for &apos;cat-
tle&apos;) would get a much larger score, 5.
In the above technique, very small phonetic
differences, such as that between a moderately
palatalized and a very palatalized [t], count the
same as major differences, such as that between
a [t] and an [e]. It would seem to be more ac-
curate to assign a greater distance to substitu-
tions involving greater phonetic distinctions. Un-
fortunately I know of no comprehensive study on
the differences between phones, at least not for
all 277 contrasts made by Wagner. Instead I dis-
tinguished them on the basis of twelve phonetic
features that systematically account for all of the
distinctions in Wagner&apos;s inventory: nasality, stric-
ture, laterality, articulator, glottis, place, palatal-
ization, rounding, length, height, strength, and
syllabicity. The features were given discrete ordi-
nal values scaled between 0 and 1, the exact values
being arbitrary. For example, place took on the
values glottal=0, uvular=0.1, postvelar=0.2, ye-
lar=0.3, prevelar=0.4, palatal=0.5, alveolar=-0. 7,
dental=0.8, and labial=1. The distance between
any two phones was judged to be the difference
between the feature values, averaged across all
twelve features. These distances were used instead
of uniform 1-unit costs in computing Levenshtein
distance. The resulting metric was called feature
string comparison.
It could be argued that it is meaningless to com-
pare the phonetics of different words, as in the case
of eallaigh vs. crodh mentioned above. Therefore
the feature string comparison was also computed
only for pairs of citations that used the same word,
so that [AL:i] vs. [aLi] would be compared, but
[AL:i] vs. [khruh] would be ignored. The differ-
ent approaches are called all-word vs. same-word
feature string comparisons.
All of these distance matrices were compared
with the isogloss matrix, to see which of them
gives results closest to that base method. I used
two different methods of comparison, Pearson&apos;s p
computed between all corresponding cells in the

which is a derivative of Kendall&apos;s 7 that Dietz
(1983) empirically found particularly accurate as
a test statistic for comparing distance matrices.&apos;
Table 1 shows that the two measures give paral-
lel results. More importantly, it shows that the
approaches based on string comparisons of the
phonetic transcriptions correlate more highly with
the isogloss approach than do the word or etymon
identity measures. Furthermore, comparing whole
phone letters works better than the more sophis-
ticated technique of comparing features, and re-
stricting comparison to pairs based on the same
words does not make the latter any better.
Of course, I do not expect that this technique
using flat 1-unit costs will prove superior to all
methods that are more sensitive to phonetic de-
tails. Feature comparison may work better if fea-
tures were weighted differentially, or if the numeric
values they assume were assigned less arbitrarily,
or if the Manhattan-style distance computation
were replaced by some formula that did not as-
sume that the features are independent of each
other. An ideal comparison would be based on
data telling how likely it is for the one phone to
turn into the other in the course of normal lan-
guage change. In the method described here, [s]
is adjudged closer to [g] than to [h]. But [s] of-
ten changes into [h] in the world&apos;s languages, and
so the pair should have a small distance; whereas
the change of [s] to [g] has never occurred to my
knowledge, and so should have a very large dis-
tance. The unfortunate fact that such ideal data
are lacking is compensated for by the fact that the
inexpensive phone-string comparison employed in
this study performs quite well.

3.2 Clustering techniques
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996731882352941">
The traditional agglomerative technique for clus-
tering has been described above. There is some

pairs of sites, j and k, and asks whether the linguistic

Kc is the average of these numbers.
variation in how the distance between two clus-
ters is measured. For this study I used the average
distance between all pairs of elements that are in
different clusters. I compared agglomeration to a
top-down method that Kaufman and Rousseeuw
(1990) call partitioning around nzedoids. This
model reduces the 0(2N) intractability of top-
down approaches discussed above by dramatically
reducing the number of binary partitions that are
considered. Here one seeks to divide the sites into
two groups by finding the two representative sites
(the medoids) around which all the other sites
cluster in such a way as to give the least average
distance between the sites and their representa-
tives. This is therefore a 0(N3) algorithm, com-
parable in efficiency to agglomeration. The pro-
cess was repeated recursively on each dialect.
One way of measuring how well a binary clus-
tering technique works for dialect grouping is to
compare for each site i its average dissimilarity
from the other sites in the same dialect, a(i), with
its average dissimilarity from the sites in the other
dialect, b(i). Kaufman and Rousseeuw (1990:83-
86) define the statistic s(i) to be 1 — a(i)lb(i) if
a(i) is less than b(i), otherwise b(i)/a(i) — 1. The
statistic thus ranges from 1 (perfect fit) to —1 (site
i would perfectly fit in the other group). Plotting
this statistic gives a silhouette by which the eye
can judge how well classified each site is. Aver-
aging this statistic across all sites gives an idea of
how felicitous the overall clustering is,
Figures 1-2 present the silhouette for clustering
the isogloss distance matrix by partitioning. This
analysis produces a large dialect which groups to-
gether the sites in Munster, Scotland, the Isle of
Man, and almost all sites in Connacht, as well
as Rathlin Island in Ulster; and another which
groups together all the other sites in Ulster, as
well as County Cavan in Connacht. Although the
Ulster group is fairly tight, with an S- of 0.41, the
other group has a more anemic .§ of 0.25, with
the sites outside of Munster and Southern Con-
nacht being indifferently classified. The weighted
.§ for both groups comes out at 0.29. By com-
parison, Figures 3-4 show what happens when
the traditional agglomerative technique is used.
The dialects of Scotland and the Isle of Man
form a cluster with a great deal of internal di-
versity (.§ = 0.12), and all the sites in Ireland
form another cluster averaging = 0.37, with only
Rathlin Island being indifferently classified. The
weighted average is 0.35, which is superior to that
of the partitioning technique.
The same comparative results obtain for almost
all of the distance measuring techniques. Table 2
shows that the .S for the first binary split is usually
appreciably higher for agglomeration than it is for
partitioning. This result suggests not any inferi-
ority of top-down techniques in general—applying
the § statistic to all binary partitions would by

appears that the assumption behind this parti-
tioning heuristic, that a site will be closer to the
medoid of its own group than to the medoid of
the other group, often fails to hold true in dialec-
tology. The lack of clean breaks between dialects

erating the distance matrix computed by pho-
netic string comparison, and indeed the top-level
topologies produced by both techniques are vir-
tually identical. Both group into one loosely-
connected entity all the sites in Scotland, and into
another all the sites in Ireland. The isogloss ap-
proach groups Manx as a cousin of the Scottish
dialects, and the phonetic approach makes it a
cousin of the Irish dialects, but in both cases the
s of Manx is very small (less than 0.06), making it
essentially intermediate between the two groups.
Thus the popular notion that Scottish, Irish and
Manx Gaelic are distinct entities is well supported
by the analyses. Both analyses group Rathlin Is-
land very weakly with the rest of Irish, but the s
for Rathlin is so low (less than 0.09) that its group-
ing too is essentially arbitrary. This aligns with
the fact that authorities disagree as to whether it
is a dialect of Irish (as does Wagner) or of Scot-
tish (O&apos;Rahilly 1932:191). Except for Rathlin Is-
land, both methods group the Irish sites into one
group containing all the sites in Ulster, and an-
other, Southern, group, which itself breaks into
a group containing all the sites in Connacht and
one containing all the sites in Munster.4 Both
methods agree on how the 87 sites are distributed
among these dialects. This three-way division ac-
cords with the universal perception that Ulster,
Connacht and Munster form the three major di-
alect groups. The special status of Ulster con-
tradicts the position of O&apos;Rahilly (1932:18) that
Connacht groups with Ulster to form a Northern
dialect over against Munster. But it agrees with
Elsie&apos;s finding (1986:255) that that province is lex-
icostatistically more remote from Connacht and
Munster than those two are from each other. Fur-
thermore, Hindley reports (1990:63) that speakers
of other dialects often switch off radio broadcasts
in Ulster Irish, &apos;which is very distinctive&apos;.
Thus the classification of the major Gaelic di-
alects gives the same general results by both dis-
tance metrics, if one discounts Manx and Rathlin
Island Gaelic, which are flagged as indifferent in
both schemes. It is encouraging that the resultant
dialect areas are continuous, align with traditional
provincial boundaries, and agree with commonly
accepted taxonomies. However, dialect groupings
at narrower levels, such as the exact subgrouping
of the major provincial dialects, are at this point
unstable. This is no doubt to be explained by the
fairly small number of mapped concepts on which
the distance metrics are based (51).5 As language

the Ulster and the Southern group. Wagner also gives
two sites in Leinster. The more southern site, in
Kilkenny, groups with the Southern group, and the
more northern site, in Co. Louth, groups with Ulster,

that province.

<bodyText confidence="0.999995935483871">
This experiment shows that an automatic proce-
dure can reliably group a language into its di-
alect areas, starting from nothing more than pho-
netic transcriptions as commonly found in linguis-
tic surveys. Accurate distance matrices, corre-
sponding highly to those obtained by the tedious
uncovering of thousands of isoglosses, can be ob-
tained by averaging the Levenshtein distance be-
tween phonetic strings, weighting equally all inser-
tion, deletion, and substitution operations on the
constituent phones. This turns out to be quite
a bit more precise than the common technique
of measuring distances by judging etymon iden-
tity, and requires even less editorial work. That
phonetic comparison is more precise is not par-
ticularly surprising, since etymon identity ignores
a wealth of phonetic, phonological, and morpho-
logical data, whereas comparing phones has the
side effect of also counting higher-level variation:
if words differ in morphemes, their phonetic dif-
ference is going to be high. As for clustering the
sites into dialect areas, the familiar bottom-up ag-
glomeration method proves superior to top-down
partitioning around medoids.
Of course simply knowing the dialect areas is
not the last word in dialectology. There remain
such essential problems as identifying the differ-
ing linguistic structures that characterize the di-
alects, and discovering their history. But all of
these tasks will be greatly facilitated by a quick
and accurate grouping of the dialects.

<abstract confidence="0.997570916666667">Dialect groupings can be discovered objectively and automatically by cluster analysis of phonetic transcriptions such as those found in a. linguistic atlas. The first step in the analysis, the computation of linguistic distance. between each pair of sites, can be computed as Levenshtein distance between phonetic strings. This correlates closely with the much more laborious technique of determining and counting isoglosses, and is more accurate than the more familiar metric of computing Hamming distance based on whether vocabulary entries match. In the actual clustering step, traditional agglomerative clustering works better than the top-down technique of partitioning around medoids. When agglomerative clustering of phonetic string comparison distances is applied to Gaelic, reasonable dialect boundaries are obtained, corresponding to national and (within Ireland) provincial boundaries.</abstract>

Are Irish, Manx, and Scottish Gaelic considered three separate languages for intrinsic linguistic reasons, or because they are spoken in different countries? To a large extent, dialectologists have found these questions difficult to answer .because they accepted Paris&apos;s conundrum. For 0 Siadhail, the ultimate scientific justification in adopting the three-dialect account is the fact that the Gael tacit (Irish-speaking territory) is so fragmented nowadays that it no longer forms a continuum. 0 Cuiv (1951:4-49) felt that. there can be no dialect boundaries because transitions are gradual. Elsie (1986:240) considers a dialect to be an area where all communities are linguistically more similar to each other than any community is to any site outside the dialect. Such notions provide a very firm, absolute notion of dialecthood: a set of communities either constitutes a dialect area, or it does not. But as the dialectometrists have shown, other notions of clustering are equally scientific and may more accurately correspond to intuitive notions of what it means to be a dialect. 2 Data The data for my study were taken from Wagner 1958.

Seguy (1973:18) insisted that the concept of dialect boundaries was meaningless, and his emphasis on the gradience of language similarity has been widely maintained. But those who do look for firm dialect affiliations (such as Babitch and Ebobisse) use bottom-up agglomerative techniques. The two linguistically closest sites are grouped into one dialect, and thenceforth treated as a unit. The process continues recursively until all sites are grouped into one superdialect embracing the entire language area under consideration. This yields a binary tree. But Kaufman and Rousseeuw (1990:44) suggest that when the emphasis in a clustering problem is on the top-level clusters—here, finding the two main dialects—then such bottom-up methods, which can potentially introduce error at each of several steps, are less reliable than top-down partitioning methods. Perhaps past researchers have used inferior bottom-up techniques simply because the necessary algorithms are computationally more tractable. Comparing all possible pairs of sites is a 0(N2) problem,&apos; whereas considering all possible two-way partitions of the dialect area is 0(2&amp;quot;).

For this study I used the average distance between all pairs of elements that are in different clusters. I compared agglomeration to a top-down method that Kaufman and Rousseeuw (1990) call partitioning around nzedoids. This model reduces the 0(2N) intractability of topdown approaches discussed above by dramatically reducing the number of binary partitions that are considered. Here one seeks to divide the sites into two groups by finding the two representative sites (the medoids) around which all the other sites cluster in such a way as to give the least average distance between the sites and their representatives. This is therefore a 0(N3) algorithm, comparable in efficiency to agglomeration. The process was repeated recursively on each dialect. One way of measuring how we</context>

Even though the cumulative effects of such differences may be great when one considers the ends of the continua (such as southern Italian versus northern French), still it seems arbitrary to draw major dialect boundaries between two villages with very similar speech patterns. Such conundrums led Paris and others to conclude that the dialect boundary, and therefore the very notion of dialect, is an ill-defined concept. More recently, the field of dialectometry, as introduced by Seguy (1971, 1973), has addressed these issues by developing several techniques for summarizing and presenting variation along multiple dimensions. They replace isoglosses with a distance matrix, which compares each site directly with all other sites, ultimately yielding a single figure that measures the linguistic distances between each pair of sites.

This is no doubt to be explained by the fairly small number of mapped concepts on which the distance metrics are based (51).5 As language 4The one site in Co. Cavan is intermediate between the Ulster and the Southern group. Wagner also gives two sites in Leinster. The more southern site, in Kilkenny, groups with the Southern group, and the more northern site, in Co. Louth, groups with Ulster, and indeed the county used to be considered part of that province. 5Seguy (1973) cites empirical research suggesting 65 differences get smaller, one expects that more data will be required in order to elucidate them. 4 Conclusions This experiment shows that an automatic procedure can reliably group a language into its dialect areas, starting from nothing more than phonetic transcriptions as commonly found in linguistic surveys. Accurate distance matrices, corresponding highly to those obtained by the tedious uncovering of thousands of isoglosses, can be obtained by averaging the Levenshtein distance between phonetic strings, weighting equally all insertion, deletion, and </context>

Elsie (1986:240) considers a dialect to be an area where all communities are linguistically more similar to each other than any community is to any site outside the dialect. Such notions provide a very firm, absolute notion of dialecthood: a set of communities either constitutes a dialect area, or it does not. But as the dialectometrists have shown, other notions of clustering are equally scientific and may more accurately correspond to intuitive notions of what it means to be a dialect. 2 Data The data for my study were taken from Wagner 1958. Wagner administered a questionnaire to native speakers of Irish Gaelic in 86 sites.2 Most of the informants were over seventy years old and 2The atlas also maps for Kilkenny some information gathered from another source. 61 had not spoken Irish since their youth. The atlas is therefore an approximate reconstruction of the linguistic landscape of the turn of the century, when the Gaeltacht was more continuous. Wagner also presents material from the Isle of Man and seven sites in Scotland. The mapped entries are presented in a very narrow phonetic transcription based on the International Phone</context>
