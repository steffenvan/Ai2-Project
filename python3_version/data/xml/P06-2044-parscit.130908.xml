Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999941133333333">
We present a computationally tractable ac-
count of the interactions between sentence
markers and focus marking in Somali. So-
mali, as a Cushitic language, has a ba-
sic pattern wherein a small ‘core’ clause
is preceded, and in some cases followed
by, a set of ‘topics’, which provide scene-
seting information against which the core
is interpreted. Some topics appear to carry
a ‘focus marker’, indicating that they are
particularly salient. We will outline a com-
putationally tractable grammar for Somali
in which focus marking emerges naturally
from a consideration of the use of a range
of sentence markers.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998065">
This paper presents a computationally tractable
account of a number of phenomena in Somali. So-
mali displays a number of properties which dis-
tinguish it from most languages for which com-
putational treatments are available, and which are
potentially problematic. We therefore start with
a brief introduction to the major properties of the
language, together with a description of how we
cover the key phenomena within a general purpose
NLP framework.

2 Morphology
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999086666666666">
Somali has a fairly standard set of inflectional af-
fixes for nouns and verbs, as outlined below. In
addition, there are a substantial set of ‘spelling
rules’ which insert and delete graphemes at the
boundaries between roots and suffixes (and cli-
tics). There is not that much to be said about the
spelling rules – Fig. 1 shows the format of a typi-
cal rule, which we compile into an FST to be used
during the process of lexical lookup.

<bodyText confidence="0.999944625">
The rule in Fig. 1 would, for instance, say
that the surface form ‘saca’ might correspond to
the underlying form ‘sac+ka’, with a morpheme
boundary and a ‘k’ inserted after the ‘c’. These
rules, of which we currently employ about 30, can
be efficiently implemented using the standard ma-
chinery of cascaded FSTs (Koskiennemi, 1985)
interwoven with the general lookup process.

2.1 Noun morphology
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99983825">
In general, a noun consists of a root and a single
affix, which provides a combination of gender and
number marking. The main complication is that
there are several declension classes, with specific
singular and plural suffixes for groups of classes
(e.g. the plural ending for declensions 1 and 3 is
‘o’) (Saeed, 1999; Lecarme, 2002). Some plural
forms involve reduplication of some part of the
word ending, e.g. declension 4 nouns form their
plural by adding ‘aC’ where ‘C’ is the final conso-
nant of the root, but this can easily be handled by
using spelling rules.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.993839">
2.2 Verb morphology
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999904333333333">
Verb morphology is slightly more complex.
Again, a typical verb consists of a root plus a num-
ber of affixes. These include derivational affixes
(Somali includes a passivising form which can
only be applied to verbs which have a ‘causative’
argument, and a causative affix which adds such

an argument) and a set of inflectional affixes which
mark aspect, tense and agreement (Andrzejewski,
1968).
The forms of the tense and agreement mark-
ers vary depending on whether the clause con-
taining the verb is the main clause or is a sub-
ordinate clause (either a relative clause or a sen-
tential complement), marked by ±main and on
whether it is in a context where the subject is re-
quired to be a zero item, marked by ±fullForm.
Note that the situation here is fairly complicated:
-fullForm versions are required in situations
where the subject is forced by local syntactic con-
straints to be a zero. There are also situations
where the subject is omitted for discourse rea-
sons, and here the +fullForm version is used
((Lecarme, 1995) uses the terms ‘restrictive’ and
‘extensive’ for -fullForm and +fullForm re-
spectively).

2.3 Cliticisation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.962264461538462">
There are a number of Somali morphemes which
can appear either bound to an adjacent word (usu-
ally the preceding word) or as free-standing lexi-
cal items. The sentence marker ‘waa’ and the pro-
noun ‘uu’, for instance, combine to produce the
form ‘wuu’ when they are adjacent to one another.
In several cases, there are quite dramatic morpho-
phonemic alterations at the boundary, so that it is
extremely important to ensure that the processes of
applying spelling rules and inspecting the lexicon
are appropriately interwoven. The definite articles,
in particular, require considerable care. There are
a number of forms of the definite article, as in

<bodyText confidence="0.999946142857143">
We deal with this by assuming that determiners
have the form gender-root-case, where the gender
markers are ‘k-’ (masculine) and ‘t-’ (feminine),
and the case markers are ‘-’ (accusative) and ‘-
u’ (nominative), with spelling rules that collapse
‘kau’ to ‘ku’ and ‘kiiu’ to ‘kii’.
The definite articles, however, cliticise onto
the preceding word, with consequential spelling
changes. It is again important to ensure that the
spelling changes are applied at the right time to
ensure that we can recognise ‘barahu’ as ‘bare’
plus ‘k+a+u’, with appropriate changes to the ‘e’
at the end of the root ‘bare’ and the ‘k’ at the start
of the determiner ‘ku’.

3.1 Framework

The syntactic description is couched in a frame-

HPSG schemas, supplemented by a variant on the
well-known distinction between internal and ex-

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.973955">
3.1.1 Lexical heads and their arguments
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99999275">
We assume that lexical items specify a (pos-
sibly empty) list of required arguments, together
with a description of whether these arguments are
normally expected to appear to the left or right.
The direction in which the arguments are expected
is language dependent, as shown in Fig. 3. Note
that the description of where the arguments are to
be found specifies the order of combination, very
much like categorial descriptions. The descrip-
tion of an English transitive verb, for instance,
is like the categorial description (S\NP)/NP,
which corresponds to an SVO surface order.

Then if we said that an English adjec-

allow it to combine with an NN to its right
to form an NN, and likewise saying that a

a VP to its left to form a VP.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.945422">
3.1.3 Non-canonical order
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99991575">
The patterns and principles outlined in §3.1.1
and §3.1.2 specify the unmarked orders for the rel-
evant phenomena. Other orders are often permit-
ted, sometimes for discourse reasons (particularly
in free word order languages such as Arabic and
Persian) and sometimes for structural reasons (e.g.
the left shifting of the WH-pronoun in ‘I distrust
the man whoz she wants to marry OZ.’).
We take the view that rather than introducing
explicit rules to allow for various non-canonical
orders, we will simply allow all possible or-
ders subject to the application of penalties. This
approach has affinities with optimality theory
(Grimshaw, 1997), save that our penalties are
treated cumulatively rather than being applied
once and for all to competing local analyses. The
algorithm we use for parsing withing this frame-
work is very similar to the algorithm described by
(Foth et al., 2005), though we use the scores asso-
ciated with partial analyses to guide the search for
a complete analysis, whereas Foth et al. use them
to choose a complete but flawed analysis to be re-
constructed. We have described the application of
this algorithm to a variety of languages (includ-
ing Greek, Spanish, German, Persian and Arabic)
elsewhere (Ramsay and Sch¨aler, 1997; Ramsay
and Mansour, 2003; Ramsay et al., 2005): space
precludes a detailed discussion here.

3.1.4 Internal:external syntax
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998727823529412">
In certain circumstances a phrase that looks as
though it belongs to category A is used in circum-
stances where you would normally expect an item
belonging to category B. The phrase ‘eating the
owl’ in ‘He concluded the banquet by eating the
owl.’, for instance, has the internal structure of a
VP, but is being used as the complement of the
preposition ‘by’ where you would normally expect
an NP. This notion has been around for too long
for its origin to be easily traced, but has been used
more recently in (Malouf, 1996)’s addition of ‘lex-
ical rules’ to HPSG for treating English nominal
gerunds, and in (Sadler, 1996)’s description of the
possibility of allowing a single c-structure to map
to multiple f-structures in LFG. We write ‘equiva-
lence rules’ of the kind given in Fig. 5 to deal with
such phenomena:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.8601034">
fsyn(head(cat(xbar(-v, +n))),

The rule in Fig. 5 says that if you have a
present participle VP (something of type +v, -n
which has vform participle, present and
which needs one more argument) then you can use
whereever you need an NP (type -v, +n with a
specifier +specified).

3.2 Somali syntax
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999939833333333">
As noted earlier, the framework outlined in §3.1
has been used to provide accounts of a number of
languages. In the current section we will sketch
some of the major properties of Somali syntax and
show how they can be captured within this frame-
work.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.501788">
3.2.1 The ‘core &amp; topic’ structure
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999524">
Every Somali sentence has a ‘core’, or ‘verbal
complex’ (Svolacchia et al., 1995), consisting of
the verb and a number of pronominal elements.
The structure of the core can be fairly easily de-
scribed by the rule in Fig. 6:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.544999">
CORE ==&gt; SUBJ,(OBJ1),(ADP*),(OBJ2),VERB
</equation>
<figureCaption confidence="0.999033">
Figure 6: The structure of the core
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.751270333333333">
The situation is not, in fact, quite as simple as
suggested by Fig. 6. The major complications are
outlined below:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.836293636363636">
1. the third person object pronouns are never ac-
tually written, so that in many cases what you
see has the form SUBJ, VERB, as in (1a),
rather than the full form given in (1b) (we will
write ‘(him)’ to denote zero pronouns):
(1) a. he (him) waited for
uu sugay
uu i sugay
b. he me waited for
2. The second complication arises with ditran-
sitive verbs. The distinction between OBJ1
</listItem>
<page confidence="0.996789">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.917398266666667">
and OBJ2 in Fig. 6 simply corresponds to
the surface order of the two pronouns, and
has very little connection with their semantic
roles (Saeed, 1999). Thus each of the sen-
tences in (2a) could mean ‘He gave me to
you’, and neither of the sentences in (2b) is
grammatical.
(2) a. i. he me1 you2 gave
uu i kaa siiyey
uu ku kay siiyey
ii. he you1 me2 gave
uu kay ku siiyey
b. i. he me2 you1 gave
uu kaa i siiyey
ii. he you2 me1 gave
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.904945125">
3. The next problem is that subject pronouns are
also sometimes omitted. There are two cases:
(i) in certain circumstances, the subject pro-
noun must be omitted, and when this happens
the verb takes a form which indicates that
this has happened. (ii) in situations where the
subject is normally present, and hence where
the verb has its standard form, the subject
may nonetheless be omitted (usually for dis-
course reasons) (Gebert, 1986).
4. There are a small number of preposition-like
items, referred to as adpositions in Fig. 6,
which can occur between the two objects, and
which cliticise onto the preceding pronoun if
there is one. The major complication here
is that just like prepositions, these require an
NP as a complement: but unlike prepositions,
they can combine either with the preceding
pronoun or the following one, or with a zero
pronoun. Thus a core like (3) has two analy-
ses, as shown in Fig. 7:
uu ika sugaa
(3) uu ika sugaa
he me at (it) waits-for

Figure 7: Analyses for (3) (0.010 secs)
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.994939769230769">
The second analysis in Fig. 7, ‘he waits for
it at me’, doesn’t make much sense, but it is
nonetheless perfectly grammatical.
5. Finally, there are a number of other minor el-
ements that can occur in the core. We do not
have space to discuss these here, and their
presence or absence does not affect the dis-
cussion in §3.3 and §3.4.
To capture these phenomena within the frame-
work outlined in §3.1, we assign Somali transitive
verbs a subcat frame like the one in Fig. 8 (the pat-
terns for intransitive and ditransitive verbs differ
from this in the obvious ways).

foot(...))}
</equation>
<figureCaption confidence="0.92007975">
Figure 8: Somali transitive verb
Fig. 8 says that the core of a Somali sentence
is a clause of the form S-O-V, where S and O are
both clitic pronouns.

<bodyText confidence="0.99955275">
The canonical position of S and O is as given.
They can appear further to the left than that to al-
low for clitic modifiers: exactly where they can
go is specified by requiring the clitic modifiers to
appear adjacent to the verb (subject to further lo-
cal constraints on their positions relative to one
another), and requiring S and O to fall inside the
scope of the ‘sentence markers’.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998612">
3.3 Sentence markers
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.86496">
A core by itself cannot be uttered as a free standing
sentence. At the very least, it has to include a ‘sen-
tence marker’. The simplest of these is the word
‘waa’. (4), for instance, is a well-formed sentence,
with the structure shown in Fig. 9.
wuu sugaa.
(4) waa uu sugaa.

<bodyText confidence="0.995430636363637">
Note that the pronoun ‘uu’ cliticises onto the
end of the sentence marker ‘waa’, producing the
written form ‘wuu’, as discussed above.
In general, however, the situation is not quite
as simple as in (4). Most sentences contain NPs
other than the pronouns in the core. The first such
examples involve introducing ‘topics’ in front of
the sentence marker.
Topics are normally definite NPs or PPs which
set the scene for the interpretation of the core. A
typical example is given in (5):

Figure 10: Sentence with topic
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.986021625">
The analysis in Fig. 10 was obtained by exploit-
ing an equivalence rule which says that an item
which has the internal properties of a -clitic
NP can be used as a ‘topic’, which we take to be a
sentence modifier.
Topics set the scene for the interpretation of
the core by providing potential referents for the
pronominal elements in the core. There are no
very strong syntactic links between the topics and
the clitic pronouns – if a topic is +nom then it will
provide the referent for the subject, but in some
(focused) contexts subject referents are not explic-
itly marked as +nom. The situation is rather like
saying ‘You know that man we were talking about,
and you know the girl we were talking about. Well,
she’s waiting for him.’.

<bodyText confidence="0.999891103448276">
The logical form given in Fig. 11, which
was constructed using using standard compo-
sitional techniques (Dowty et al., 1981), says
the speaker is marking some known man
ref(AB(NIM(B))) as being topical, and is then
making a claim about the existence of a waiting
event SUG(C) involving some known female as
its agent and some other known entity as its object.
Note that we include discourse related information
– that the speaker is first marking something as be-
ing topical and then making a claim – in the log-
ical form. This seems like a sensible thing to do,
since this information is encoded by lexical and
syntactic choices in the same way as the proposi-
tional content itself, and hence it makes sense to
extract it compositionally at the same time and in
the same way as we do the propositional content.
Somali provides a number of such sentence
markers. ‘in’ is used for marking sentential com-
plements, in much the same way as the English
complementiser ‘that’ is used to mark the start
of a sentential clause in ‘I know that she like
strawberry icecream.’ (Lecarme, 1984). There
is, however, an alternative form for main clauses,
where one of the topics is marked as being par-
ticularly interesting by the sentence markers ‘baa’
or ‘ayaa’ (‘baa’ and ‘ayaa’ seem to be virtually
equivalent, with the choice between them being
driven by stylistic/phonological considerations):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.644678">
(6) baraha baa ninka sugaa.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.997230315789474">
‘baa’/‘ayaa’ and ‘waa’ are in complementary
distribution: every main clause has to have a sen-
tence marker, which is nearly always one of these
two, and they never occur in the same sentence.
The key difference is that ‘baa’ marks the item
to its left as being particularly significant. Ordi-
nary topics introduce an item into the context, to
be picked up by one of the core pronouns, with-
out marking any of them as being more prominent
than the others. The item to the left of ‘baa’ is
indeed available as an anchor for a core pronoun,
but it is also marked as being more important than
the other topics.
We deal with this by assuming that ‘baa’ sub-
categorises for an NP to its left, and then forms a
sentence marker looking to modify a sentence to
its right. The resulting parse tree for (6) is given
in Fig. 12, with the interpretation that arises from
this tree in Fig. 13.

focused item, and also accounting for its comple-
mentary distribution with ‘waa’. The fact that the
combination of ‘baa’ and the focussed NP can be
either preceded or followed by other topics means
that we have to put very careful constraints on
where it can appear. This is made more complex
by the fact that the subject of the core sentence can
cliticise onto ‘baa’, despite the fact that there may
be a subsequent topic, as in (7).

3.4 Relative clauses &amp; ‘waxa’-clefts
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999922342857143">
We noted above that in general Somali clauses
contain a sentence marker – generally one of
‘waa’, ‘baa’ and ‘ayaa’ for main clauses, or one
of ‘in’ for subordinate clauses. There are two
linked exceptions to this rule: relative clauses, and
‘waxa’-clefts.
Somali does not possess distinct WH-pronouns
(Saeed, 1999). Instead, the clitic pronouns (in-
cluding the zero third-person pronoun) can act as
WH-markers.
This is a bit awkward for any parsing algo-
rithm which depends propagating the WH-marker
up the parse tree until a complete clause has been
analysed, and then using it to decide whether that
clause is a relative clause or not. We do not want
to introduce two versions of each pronoun, one
with a WH-marker and the other without, and then
produce alternative analyses for each. Doing this
would produce very large numbers of alternative
analyses, since each core item is can be viewed ei-
ther way, so that a simple clause involving a transi-
tive clause would produce three analyses (one with
the subject WH-marked, one with the object WH-
marked, and one with neither).
We therefore leave the WH-marking on the
clitic pronouns open until we have an analysis of
the clause containing them. If we need to con-
sider using this clause in a context where a relative
clause is required, we inspect the clitic pronouns
and decide which ones, if any are suitable for use
as the pivot (i.e. the WH-pronoun which links to
the modified analysis).
Relative clauses do not require a sentence
marker. We thus get analyses of relative clauses
as shown in Fig. 15 for (8).

Note the reduced form of ‘wadaya’ in (8). The
key here is that the subject of ‘wadaya’ is the
‘pivot’ of the relative clause (the item linking the
clause to the modified nominal). When the subject
plays this role it is forced to be a zero item, and it
is this that makes the verb take the -fullForm
versions of the agreement and tense markers.
Apart from the fact that you can’t tell whether
a clitic pronoun is acting as a WH-marker or not
until you see the context, and the requirement for

reduced form verbs with zero subjects, Somali rel-
ative clauses are not all that different from relative
clauses in other languages. They are, however, re-
lated to a phenomenon which is rather less com-
mon.
We start by considering nominal sentences. So-
mali allows for scarenominal sentences consisting
of just a pair of NPs. This is a fairly common
phenomenon, where the overall semantic effect is
as though there were an invisible copula linking
them (see Arabic, malay, English ‘small clauses’,
... ). We deal with this by assuming that any ac-
cusative NP could be the predication in a zero sen-
tence. The only complication is that in ordinary
Somali sentences the only items which follow the
sentence marker are clitic pronouns and modifiers.
For nominal sentences, the predicative NP, and
nothing else, follows the sentence marker.
For uniformity we assume that there is in fact a
zero subject, with the +nom NP that appears be-
fore the sentence marker acting as a topic.
waxu waa baabuurka.
(9) wax ka I waa baabuur ka
thing the +NOM s-marker truck the
Any normal NP can appear as the topic of such
a sentence. In particular, the noun ‘wax’, which
means ‘thing’, can appear in this position:
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.966008">
Figure 16: ‘the thing: it’s the truck’
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.97420832">
The analysis in Fig. 16 corresponds to an inter-
pretation something like ‘The thing we were talk-
ing about, well it’s the truck’. Note the analysis of
‘waxu’ here as the noun ‘wax’ followed by the def-
inite article ‘ka’ and the nominative case marker
‘I’.
There is no reason why the topic in such a sen-
tence should not contain a relative clause. In (10),
for instance, the topic is ‘waxaan doonayo I’ – ‘the
thing which I want’.
waxaan doonayaa waa lacag.
(10) wax ka aan doonayo I waa lacag
thing the I want +NOM s-marker money
Note that ‘doonayaa’ here is being read as
the {+fullForm,-main} version of the verb
‘doonayo’ followed by a cliticised nominative
marker ‘I’. The choice of +fullForm this time
arises because the subject pronoun is not WH-
marked, which means that it is not forced to be
zero: remember that -fullForm is used if the
local constraints require the subject to be zero, not
just if it happens to be omitted for discourse or
stylistic reasons. Then in the analysis in Fig. 17
‘wax ka aan doonayo I’ is a +nom NP functioning
as the topic of a nominal sentence.

So far so simple. ‘waxa’, however, also takes
part in a rather more complex construction.
In general, the items that occur as topics in So-
mali are definite NPs (Saeed, 1984). In all the
examples above, we have used definite NPs in
the topic positions, because that it is what nor-
mally happens. If you want to introduce some-
thing into the conversation it is more usual to use a
‘waxa-cleft’, or ‘heralding sentence’ (Andrzejew-
ski, 1975).
The typical surface form of such a construction
is shown in (11):
waxaan doonayaa lacag.
(11) waxa aan doonayaa lacag
waxa I want money
The key things to note about (11) are as follow:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.967941857142857">
• There is no sentence marker. Or at any
rate, the standard sentence markers ‘waa’ and
‘baa’ are missing.
• The subject pronoun ‘aan’ has cliticised onto
the word ‘waxa’ to form ‘waxaan’.
• The verb ‘doonayaa’ is +fullForm
• The noun ‘lacag’ follows the verb. This is

unusual, since generally NPs are used as top-
ics preceding the core and, generally, the sen-
tence marker.

These facts are very suggestive: (i) the lack
of any other item acting as sentence marker sug-
gests that ‘waxa’ is playing this role. (ii) the fact
that ‘uu’ has cliticised onto this item supports this
claim, since subject pronouns typically cliticise
onto sentence markers rather than onto topic NPs.
We therefore suggest that ‘waxa’ here is func-
tioning as sentence marker. Like ‘baa’, it focuses
attention on some particular NP, but in this case
the NP follows the core.

<figureCaption confidence="0.968467">
Figure 18: Parse tree for (11)

<bodyText confidence="0.999985166666667">
Thus ‘waxa’, as a sentence marker, is just like
‘baa’ except that ‘baa’ expects its focused NP to
follow it immediately, with the core following that,
whereas the order is reversed for ‘waxa’ (Andrze-
jewski, 1975).
It seems extremely likely that ‘waxa’-clefts are
historically related to sentences like (10). The sub-
tle differences in the surface forms (presence or
absence of ‘waa’ and form of the verb), however,
lead to radically different analyses. How simple
nominal sentences with topics including ‘waxa’
and a relative clause turned into ‘waxa’-clefts is
beyond the scope of this paper. The key obser-
vation here is that ‘waxa’-clefts can be given a
straightforward analysis by assuming that ‘waxa’
can function as a sentence-marker that focuses at-
tention on a topical NP that ‘follows’ the core of
the sentence.

4 Conclusions

<bodyText confidence="0.999990857142857">
We have outlined a computational treatment of
Somali that runs right through from morphology
and morphographemics to logical forms. The con-
struction of logical forms is a fairly routine activ-
ity, given that we have carried out this work within
a framework that has already been used for a num-
ber of other languages, and hence the machinery
for deriving logical forms from semantically an-
notated parse trees is already available. The most
notable point about Somali semantics within this
framework is the inclusion of the basic illocution-
ary force within the logic form, which allows us to
also treat topic and focus as discourse phenomena
within the logical form.

<abstract confidence="0.999648">We present a computationally tractable account of the interactions between sentence markers and focus marking in Somali. Somali, as a Cushitic language, has a basic pattern wherein a small ‘core’ clause is preceded, and in some cases followed by, a set of ‘topics’, which provide sceneseting information against which the core is interpreted. Some topics appear to carry a ‘focus marker’, indicating that they are particularly salient. We will outline a computationally tractable grammar for Somali in which focus marking emerges naturally from a consideration of the use of a range of sentence markers.</abstract>

The forms of the tense and agreement markers vary depending on whether the clause containing the verb is the main clause or is a subordinate clause (either a relative clause or a sentential complement), marked by ±main and on whether it is in a context where the subject is required to be a zero item, marked by ±fullForm.

The next problem is that subject pronouns are also sometimes omitted. There are two cases: (i) in certain circumstances, the subject pronoun must be omitted, and when this happens the verb takes a form which indicates that this has happened. (ii) in situations where the subject is normally present, and hence where the verb has its standard form, the subject may nonetheless be omitted (usually for discourse reasons) (Gebert, 1986). 4. There are a small number of preposition-like items, referred to as adpositions in Fig. 6, which can occur between the two objects, and which cliticise onto the preceding pronoun if there is one. The major complication here is that just like prepositions, these require an NP as a complement: but unlike prepositions, they can combine either with the preceding pronoun or the following one, or with a zero pronoun.

Other orders are often permitted, sometimes for discourse reasons (particularly in free word order languages such as Arabic and Persian) and sometimes for structural reasons (e.g. the left shifting of the WH-pronoun in ‘I distrust the man whoz she wants to marry OZ.’). We take the view that rather than introducing explicit rules to allow for various non-canonical orders, we will simply allow all possible orders subject to the application of penalties. This approach has affinities with optimality theory (Grimshaw, 1997), save that our penalties are treated cumulatively rather than being applied once and for all to competing local analyses. The algorithm we use for parsing withing this framework is very similar to the algorithm described by (Foth et al., 2005), though we use the scores associated with partial analyses to guide the search for a complete analysis, whereas Foth et al. use them to choose a complete but flawed analysis to be reconstructed.

This seems like a sensible thing to do, since this information is encoded by lexical and syntactic choices in the same way as the propositional content itself, and hence it makes sense to extract it compositionally at the same time and in the same way as we do the propositional content. Somali provides a number of such sentence markers. ‘in’ is used for marking sentential complements, in much the same way as the English complementiser ‘that’ is used to mark the start of a sentential clause in ‘I know that she like strawberry icecream.’ (Lecarme, 1984). There is, however, an alternative form for main clauses, where one of the topics is marked as being particularly interesting by the sentence markers ‘baa’ or ‘ayaa’ (‘baa’ and ‘ayaa’ seem to be virtually equivalent, with the choice between them being driven by stylistic/phonological considerations): (6) baraha baa ninka sugaa. ‘baa’/‘ayaa’ and ‘waa’ are in complementary distribution: every main clause has to have a sentence marker, which is nearly always one of these two, and they never occur in the same sentence. The key difference is that ‘baa’ marks the item to its left as being particula</context>

Note that the situation here is fairly complicated: -fullForm versions are required in situations where the subject is forced by local syntactic constraints to be a zero. There are also situations where the subject is omitted for discourse reasons, and here the +fullForm version is used ((Lecarme, 1995) uses the terms ‘restrictive’ and ‘extensive’ for -fullForm and +fullForm respectively). 2.3 Cliticisation There are a number of Somali morphemes which can appear either bound to an adjacent word (usually the preceding word) or as free-standing lexical items. The sentence marker ‘waa’ and the pronoun ‘uu’, for instance, combine to produce the form ‘wuu’ when they are adjacent to one another. In several cases, there are quite dramatic morphophonemic alterations at the boundary, so that it is extremely important to ensure that the processes of applying spelling rules and inspecting the lexicon a</context>

In general, the items that occur as topics in Somali are definite NPs (Saeed, 1984). In all the examples above, we have used definite NPs in the topic positions, because that it is what normally happens. If you want to introduce something into the conversation it is more usual to use a ‘waxa-cleft’, or ‘heralding sentence’ (Andrzejewski, 1975). The typical surface form of such a construction is shown in (11): waxaan doonayaa lacag. (11) waxa aan doonayaa lacag waxa I want money The key things to note about (11) are as follow: • There is no sentence marker. Or at any rate, the standard sentence markers ‘waa’ and ‘baa’ are missing. • The subject pronoun ‘aan’ has cliticised on</context>

The major complications are outlined below: 1. the third person object pronouns are never actually written, so that in many cases what you see has the form SUBJ, VERB, as in (1a), rather than the full form given in (1b) (we will write ‘(him)’ to denote zero pronouns): (1) a. he (him) waited for uu sugay uu i sugay b. he me waited for 2. The second complication arises with ditransitive verbs. The distinction between OBJ1 339 and OBJ2 in Fig. 6 simply corresponds to the surface order of the two pronouns, and has very little connection with their semantic roles (Saeed, 1999). Thus each of the sentences in (2a) could mean ‘He gave me to you’, and neither of the sentences in (2b) is grammatical. (2) a. i. he me1 you2 gave uu i kaa siiyey uu ku kay siiyey ii. he you1 me2 gave uu kay ku siiyey b. i. he me2 you1 gave uu kaa i siiyey ii. he you2 me1 gave 3. The next problem is that subject pronouns are also sometimes omitted. There are two cases: (i) in certain circumstances, the subject pronoun must be omitted, and when this happens the verb takes a form which indicates that this has happened. (ii) in situations where the subject is normally present, and hence where t</context>

Between them, these two ensure that we get unique analyses for sentences involving a sentence marker and a number of topics, despite the wide range of potential surface orders. 3.4 Relative clauses &amp; ‘waxa’-clefts We noted above that in general Somali clauses contain a sentence marker – generally one of ‘waa’, ‘baa’ and ‘ayaa’ for main clauses, or one of ‘in’ for subordinate clauses. There are two linked exceptions to this rule: relative clauses, and ‘waxa’-clefts. Somali does not possess distinct WH-pronouns (Saeed, 1999). Instead, the clitic pronouns (including the zero third-person pronoun) can act as WH-markers. This is a bit awkward for any parsing algorithm which depends propagating the WH-marker up the parse tree until a complete clause has been analysed, and then using it to decide whether that clause is a relative clause or not. We do not want to introduce two versions of each pronoun, one with a WH-marker and the other without, and then produce alternative analyses for each. Doing this would produce very large numbers of alternative analyses, since each core item is can be viewed either way, so that a</context>

In the current section we will sketch some of the major properties of Somali syntax and show how they can be captured within this framework. 3.2.1 The ‘core &amp; topic’ structure Every Somali sentence has a ‘core’, or ‘verbal complex’ (Svolacchia et al., 1995), consisting of the verb and a number of pronominal elements. The structure of the core can be fairly easily described by the rule in Fig. 6: CORE ==&gt; SUBJ,(OBJ1),(ADP*),(OBJ2),VERB Figure 6: The structure of the core The situation is not, in fact, quite as simple as suggested by Fig. 6.
