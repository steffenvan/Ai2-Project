ABSTRACT
A method is described for handling the
ambiguity and vagueness that is often found
in quantifications - the semantically complex
relations between nominal and verbal
constituents. In natural language certain
aspects of quantification are often left
open; it is argued that the analysis of
quantification in a model-theoretic framework
should use semantic representations in which
this may also be done. This paper shows a form
for such a representation and how &amp;quot;ambiguous&amp;quot;
representations are used in an elegant and
efficient procedure for semantic analysis,
incorporated in the TENDUM dialogue system.
The quantification ambiguity explosion
problem
Quantification is a complex phenomenon
that occurs whenever a nominal and a verbal
constituent are combined in such a way that
the denotation of the verbal constituent is
predicated Of arguments supplied by the
(denotation of the) nominal constituent.
This gives rise to a number of questions such
as (1) What objects serve as predicate
arguments? (2) Of how many objects is the
predicate true? (3) How many objects are
considered as potential arguments of the
predicate?
When we consider these questions for a
sentence with a few noun phrases, we readily
see that the sentence has a multitude of
possible interpretations. Even a sentence
with only one NP such as
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.554975">
(1) Five boats were lifted
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999657261904762">
has a variety of possible readings, depending
on whether the boats were lifted individually,
collectively, or in groups of five, and on
whether the total number of boats involved
is exactly five or at least five. For a
sentence with two numerically quantified
NPs, such as &apos;Three Russians visited five
Frenchmen&apos;, Partee (1975) distinguished 8
readings depending on whether the Russians
and the Frenchmen visited each other indivi-
dually of collectively and on the relative
scopes of the quantifiers. Partee&apos;s analysis
is in fact still rather crude; a somewhat
more refined analysis, which distinguished
group readings and readings with equally wide
scope of the quantifiers, leads to 30 inter-
pretations (Bunt, in press).
This presents a problem for any attempt
at a precise and systematic description of
semantic structures in natural language. On
the one hand an articulate analysis of
quantification is needed for obtaining the
desired interpretations of every sentence,
while on the other hand we do not want to end
up with dozens of interpretations for every
sentence.
To some extent this &amp;quot;ambiguity explosion
problem&amp;quot; is an artefact of the usual method
of formal semantic analysis. In this method
sentences are translated into formulae of a
logical language, the truth conditions of
which are determined by model-theoretic in-
terpretation rules. Now one might want to
consider a sentence like (1) not as ambiguous,
but only as sayingthat five boats were lifted,
without specifying how they were lifted. But
translation of the sentence into a logical
representation forces one to be specific. That
is, the logical representation language
requires distinction between such interpreta-
tions as represented by (2) (individual
reading) and (3) (group reading):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.998794">
(2) #({x E BOATS: LIFTED(x)} ) = 5
(3) 3xe{yC BOATS:# (y) = 5} : LIFTED (x)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998203863636364">
In other words, the analysis framework forces
us to make distinctions which we might not
always want to make.
To tackle this problem, I have devised a
method of representing quantified expressions
in a logical language with the possibility of
leaving certain quantification aspects open.
This method has been implemented in the TENDUM
dialogue system, developed jointly at the
Institute for Perception Research in Eindhoven
and the Computational Linguistics Research
Unit at Tilburg University, Department of
Linguistics (Bunt, 1982; 1983; Bunt &amp; thoe
Schwartzenberg, 1982;). This method is not
only of theoretical interest, but also pro-
vides a computationally efficient treatment
of quantification.
Ambiguity resolution
In a semantic analysis system which
translates natural language expressions into
formal representations, all disambiguation
takes place during this translation.
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999985777777778">
This applies both to purely lexical ambiguities and
to structural ambiguities. For lexical disambigua-
tion this means that a lexical item has several
translations in the representation language (RL),
which are all produced by a dictionary lookup at
the beginning of the analysis. The generation of
semantic representations for sentences that display
both lexical and structural ambiguity thus takes
place as depicted in Fig. 1:

Since the lexical ambiguities considered here are
purely semantic, the same grammar rules will be
applicable to all the lexical interpretations
(assuming that the grammar does not contain world
knowledge to filter out those interpretations that
are meaningless in the discourse domain under
consideration). Since the amount of processing
involved in the application of grammar rules is
very large compared to that of translating a lexi-
cal item to its RL instances, this set-up is not
very efficient. In the PHLIQA1 question-answering
system (Bronnenberg et al., 1980) the syntactic/
semantic and lexical processing stages were there-
fore reversed, so that disambiguation takes place
as depicted in Fig. 2:

grammar rules lookup tation

In this setup an intermediate representation
language is uded which is identical to RL except
that is has an ambiguous constant for every content
word of the natural language.
It turns out that semantic analysis along
these lines can be formulated entirely in terms of
the traditional model-theoretic framework (Bunt,
in press), therefore this method is appropriately
called two-level model-theoretic semantics. This
method has been implemented in the TENDUM system,
with an intermediate representation language that
contains ambiguous constants corresponding to
quantification aspects, in addition to ambiguous
constants corresponding to nouns, verbs, etc.
Quantification aspects
The different aspects of quantification are
closely related to the semantic functions of
determiners. These functions depend on their
syntactic position in a determiner sequence. A
full-fledged basic noun phrase has the layout:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9846602">
(4) pre- + central + post- + head
determiner determiner determiner noun
(see Quirk et al., 1972, p.146). For example, in
the NP
(5) All my four children
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.98557926">
the centraldeterminer &apos;my&apos; restricts the range of
reference of the head noun &apos;children&apos; to the set
of my children; the predeterminer &apos;all&apos; indicates
that a predicate, combined with the noun phrase to
form a proposition, is associated with all the
members of that set, and the postdeterminer &apos;four&apos;
expresses the presupposition that the set consists
of four elements. This set is determined by the
central determiner plus the denotation of the head
noun; I will call it the source of the quantifica-
tion. In the case of an NP without central
determiner the source is the denotation of the head
noun. For the indication of the quantity or
fraction of that part of the source that is invol-
ved in a predication I will use the term source
involvement.
Quantification owes its name to the fact that
source involvement is often made explicit by means
of quantitative (pre-)determiners like &apos;five&apos;,
&apos;many&apos;, &apos;two liters of&apos;. Obviously, source
involvement is a central aspect of quantification.
Another important aspect of quantification is
illustrated by the following sentences:
(6a) The chairs were lifted by all the boys
(6b) The chairs were lifted by each of the boys
These sentences differ in that (6b) says
unambiguously that every one of the boys lifted the
chairs, whereas (6a) is unspecific as to what each
individual boy did: it only says that the chairs
were lifted and that all the boys were involved in
the lifting, but it does not specify, for instance,
whether every one of the boys lifted the chairs or
all the boys together lifted the chairs. The
quantifiers &apos;all&apos; and &apos;each (of)&apos; thus both
indicate complete involvement of the source, but
differ in their determination of how a predicate
(&apos;lifted the chairs&apos;) is applied to the source.
&apos;Each&apos; indicates that the predicate is applied to
the individual members of the source; &apos;all&apos; leaves
open whether the predicate is applied to individual
members, to groups of menbers, or to the sources
as a whole. To designate the way in which a pre-
dicate is applied to, or &amp;quot;distributed over&amp;quot;, the
source of a quantification, I use the term
distribution. A way of expressing the distribution
of a quantification is by specifying the class of
objects that the predicate is applied to, and how
this class is related to the source. In the
distributive case this class is precisely the :
NL
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.990235">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.98749252">
source; in the collective case it is the set
having the source as its only element. I will
refer to the class of objects that the predicate is
applied to as the domain of the quantification. The
distribution of a quantification over an NP
denotation can be viewed as specifying how the
domain can be computed from the source. Where
domain = source I will speak of individual distri-
bution, where domain = {source} of collective
distribution.
Individual and collective are not the only
possible distributions. Consider the sentence
(7) All these machines assemble 12 parts.
This sentence may describe a situation in which
certain machines assemble sets of twelve parts,
i.e. a relation between individual machines and
groups of twelve parts. If PARTS is the set denoted
by &apos;parts&apos;, the direct object quantification domain
is gi,(PARTS), the subset of P(PARTS) containing
only those subsets of PARTS that have twelve
members. I call this type of distribution group
distribution. In this case the numerical quantifier
indicates group size.
A slightly different form of &amp;quot;group
quantification&amp;quot; is found in the sentence
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.780839">
(8) Twelve men conspired.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998280380952381">
In view of the collective nature of conspiring, it
would seem that &apos;twelve&apos; should again be inter-
preted as indicating group size, so that the
sentence may be represented by
(9) 3 x E 12 CONSPIRE(x)
However, as the existential quantifier brings out
clearly, this interpretation would leave open the
possiblity that several groups of 12 men conspired,
which is probably not what was intended. The more
plausible interpretation, where exactly one group
of 12 men conspired, I will call the strong group
reading of the sentence, and the other one the
weak group reading. On the strong group reading
the quantifier &apos;twelve&apos; has a double function: it
indicates both source involvement and group size.
In a sentence like
(10) The crane lifted the tubes
there is no indication as to whether the tubes were
lifted one by one (individual distribution), two by
two (weak group distribution with group size 2),
one-or-two by one-or-two (weak group distribution
with group size 1-2), ..., or all in one go
(collective distribution). The quantification is
unspecific in this respect. In such a case I will
say that the distribution is unspecific. If S is
the source of the quantification, the domain is in
this case the set consisting of the elements of S
and the plural subsets of S.
Distribution and source involvement are the
two central aspects of quantification that I will
focus on here.
Quantification in two-level model-theoretic
semantics
Consider a non-intensional verb, denoting a
one-place predicate P (a function from individuals
to truth values), which is combined with a noun
phrase with associated source S (a set of indivi-
duals). The quantification then predicates the
source involvement of the set of those elements of
the quantification domain, defined by S and the
distribution, for which P is true. This can be
represented by a formula of the following form:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.954727777777778">
(11) S-INVOLVEMENT({xEQUANT.DOMAIN: P(x) } )
For example, consider the representation of the
readings of sentence (1) &apos;Five boats were lifted&apos;,
with individual, collective, and weak and strong
group distribution:
(12a) (Xz:-4z)=5) ({x e BOATS: LIFTED(x)1)
(12b) (Xz:04z)&gt;1) ({x E 95(BOATS): LIFTED(x)/)
(12c) az:06(z)=1) ({x ESIVBOATS): LIFTED(x)})
(12d) (Xz:75.1(z)&apos;5-)UBOATS
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.890943142857143">
(fx e BOATS UP+(BOATS):
- (
LIFTED(x)1))
where 9+(S) denotes the set of plural subsets of S.
The notation Us(D) is used to represent the set of
those members of S &amp;quot;occuring in D&amp;quot;; the precise
definition is:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999664692307692">
(13) U (D) = {xEES: xED v (3 yEED: xEEy)}
Note that in all cases the quantification domain is
closely related to the source in a way determined
by the distribution. I have claimed above that the
distribution canbe construed as a function that
computes the quantification domain, given the
source. Indeed, this can be acomplished by nears
of a function of two arguments, one being the
source and the other the group size, in the case
of a group distribution. A little bit of formula
manipulation readilyshowsthat all the formulas
(12a-d) can be cast in the form
(14) (Xz: N( Us(z)))({xEd(k,S): 9(x) 1)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999909142857143">
where S represents the quantification source,
(Xz: N(Uc (z))) the source involvement, k the group
size, and d the &amp;quot;distribution function&amp;quot; computing
the quantification domain. (For technical details
of this representation see Bunt, in press). The
most interesting point to note about this represen-
tation is that the distribution of the quantifica-
tion, which in other treatments is always reflec-
ted in the syntactic structure of the representa-
tion, corresponds to a term of the representation
language here. For this term we substitute
expressions like (Ak,s:el(s)) to obtain a particu-
lar interpretation.
I will now indicate how representations of
the form (14) are constructed in the TENDUM system.
The construction of quantification
representation in the TENDUM system
The TENDUM system uses a grammar consisting
of phrase-structure rules augmented with semantic
rules that construct a representation of a rewrit-
ten phrase from those of its constituents (see
Bunt, 1983). For the sentence &apos;Five boats were
lifted this works as follows.
The number &apos;five&apos; is represented in the
lexicon as an item of syntactic category &apos;number
with representation &apos;5&apos;. To this item, a rule
applies that constructsa syntactic structure of
category numeral with representation
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.993188">
132
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999719">
(AY:# (Y)=5), which I abbreviate as FIVE. To this
structure a rule applies that constructs a
syntactic structure of category&apos;determinee with
representation
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.649954">
(15) (AX: (AP: FIVE(Ux. ({xE d(FIVE,X): P(x) } ))))
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.982492097560976">
A rule constructing a syntactic structure of cate-
gory&apos;noun phrase&apos; from a determiner and a nominal
(inthe simplest case: a noun) applies to &apos;five&apos; and
&apos;boats&apos;, combining their representations by
applying (15) as a function to the noun representa-
tion BOATS. After A-conversion, this results in
(16) (A P : FIVE (UBOATS( {xE d (FIVE, BOATS) : P (x) }) ) )
A rule constructing a sentence from a noun phrase
and a verb applies to &apos;five boats&apos; and &apos;were
lifted&apos;, combining their representations by
applying (16) as a function to the verb representa-
tion LIFTED. After A-conversion, this results in
(17):
(17) FIVE (UBOATS({ xE d (FIVE, BOATS) : P(x)1 ) )
Now suppose the sentence is interpreted relative
to a domain of discourse where we have such boats
and lifting facilities that it is impossible for
more than one boat to be lifted at the same time.
This is reflected in the fact that the RL predicate
LIFTED is of such a type that it can only apply to
individual boats. Assuming that the ambiguous
constant BOATS has the single instance BOATSr and
that LIFTED has the single instance
(Az: LIFTED (z)), the instantiation rules, con-
strained byrthe type restrictions of RL, will
produce the representation:
(18) FIVE(uBoaTS ({xE BOATSr: LIFTEDr(x)} ))
(For the instantiation process see Bunt, in press,
chapter 7.) This is readily seen to be
equivalent to the more familiar form:
(19) 06( {sEBOATSr: LIFTED (x)}) = 5
If, in addition to, or instead of the distributive
reading we want to generate another reading of the
sentence, then we extend or modify the instantia-
tion function for LIFTED accordingly.
This shows how the analysis method generates
the representations of only those interpretations
which are relevant in a given domain of discourse,
and does so without generating intermediate
representations as artefacts of the use of a
logical representation language.

In a semantic analysis system which translates natural language expressions into formal representations, all disambiguation takes place during this translation. 130 This applies both to purely lexical ambiguities and to structural ambiguities. For lexical disambiguation this means that a lexical item has several translations in the representation language (RL), which are all produced by a dictionary lookup at the beginning of the analysis.

These functions depend on their syntactic position in a determiner sequence. A full-fledged basic noun phrase has the layout: (4) pre- + central + post- + head determiner determiner determiner noun (see Quirk et al., 1972, p.146). For example, in the NP (5) All my four children the centraldeterminer &apos;my&apos; restricts the range of reference of the head noun &apos;children&apos; to the set of my children; the predeterminer &apos;all&apos; indicates that a predicate, combined with the noun phrase to form a proposition, is associated with all the members of that set, and the postdeterminer &apos;four&apos; expresses the presupposition that the set consists of four elements. This set is determined by the central determiner plus the denotation of the head I will call it the sourceof the quantification. In the case of an NP without central determiner the source is the denotation of the head noun. For the indication of the quantity or fraction of that part of the source that is involin a predication I will use the term involvement. Quantification owes its name to the fact that source involvement is often made explicit by means of quantitative (pre-)determiners like &apos;five&apos;, &apos;many&apos;, &apos;two liters of&apos;. Obviously, source involvement is a central aspect of quantification. Another important aspect of quantification is illustrated by the following sentences: (6a) The chairs were lifted by all the boys (6b) The chairs were lifted by each of the boys These sentences differ in that (6b) says unambiguously that every one of the boys lifted the chairs, whereas (6a) is unspecific as to what each individual boy did: it only says that the chairs were lifted and that all the boys were involved in the lifting, but it does not specify, for instance, whether every one of the boys lifted the chairs or all the boys together lifted the chairs. The quantifiers &apos;all&apos; and &apos;each (of)&apos; thus both indicate complete involvement of the source, but differ in their determination of how a predicate (&apos;lifted the chairs&apos;) is applied to the source. &apos;Each&apos; indicates that the predicate is applied to the individual members of the source; &apos;all&apos; leaves open whether the predicate is applied to individual members, to groups of menbers, or to the sources as a whole. To designate the way in which a predicate is applied to, or &amp;quot;distributed over&amp;quot;, the source of a quantification, I use the term distribution.A way of expressing the distribution of a quantification is by specifying the class of objects that the predicate is applied to, and how this class is related to the source. In the distributive case this class is precisely the : 131 source; in the collective case it is the set having the source as its only element. I will refer to the class of objects that the predicate is to as the domainof the quantification. The distribution of a quantification over an NP denotation can be viewed as specifying how the domain can be computed from the source. Where = source I will speak of individualdistriwhere domain = {source} of distribution. Individual and collective are not the only possible distributions. Consider the sentence (7) All these machines assemble 12 parts. This sentence may describe a situation in which certain machines assemble sets of twelve parts, i.e. a relation between individual machines and groups of twelve parts. If PARTS is the set denoted by &apos;parts&apos;, the direct object quantification domain the subset of P(PARTS) containing only those subsets of PARTS that have twelve I call this type of distribution distribution.In this case the numerical quantifier indicates group size. A slightly different form of &amp;quot;group quantification&amp;quot; is found in the sentence (8) Twelve men conspired. In view of the collective nature of conspiring, it would seem that &apos;twelve&apos; should again be interpreted as indicating group size, so that the sentence may be represented by (9) 3 x E 12 CONSPIRE(x) However, as the existential quantifier brings out clearly, this interpretation would leave open the possiblity that several groups of 12 men conspired, which is probably not what was intended. The more plausible interpretation, where exactly one group of 12 men conspired, I will call the strong group readingof the sentence, and the other one the group reading.On the strong group reading the quantifier &apos;twelve&apos; has a double function: it indicates both source involvement and group size. In a sentence like (10) The crane lifted the tubes there is no indication as to whether the tubes were lifted one by one (individual distribution), two by two (weak group distribution with group size 2), one-or-two by one-or-two (weak group distribution with group size 1-2), ..., or all in one go (collective distribution). The quantification is unspecific in this respect. In such a case I will that the distribution is unspecific.If S is the source of the quantification, the domain is in this case the set consisting of the elements of S and the plural subsets of S. Distribution and source involvement are the two central aspects of quantification that I will focus on here. Quantification in two-level model-theoretic semantics Consider a non-intensional verb, denoting a one-place predicate P (a function from individuals to truth values), which is combined with a noun phrase with associated source S (a set of individuals). The quantification then predicates the source involvement of the set of those elements of the quantification domain, defined by S and the distribution, for which P is true. This can be represented by a formula of the following form: (11) S-INVOLVEMENT({xEQUANT.DOMAIN: P(x) } ) For example, consider the representation of the readings of sentence (1) &apos;Five boats were lifted&apos;, with individual, collective, and weak and strong group distribution:</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.999425521739131">where 9+(S) denotes the set of plural subsets of S. notation is used to represent the set of members of S &amp;quot;occuring in precise definition is: (13) U (D) = {xEES: xED v (3 yEED: xEEy)} Note that in all cases the quantification domain is closely related to the source in a way determined by the distribution. I have claimed above that the distribution canbe construed as a function that computes the quantification domain, given the source. Indeed, this can be acomplished by nears of a function of two arguments, one being the source and the other the group size, in the case of a group distribution. A little bit of formula manipulation readilyshowsthat all the formulas (12a-d) can be cast in the form (Xz: N( 9(x) 1) where S represents the quantification source, (z))) the source involvement, k the group size, and d the &amp;quot;distribution function&amp;quot; computing quantification domain. technical details of this representation see Bunt, in press). The most interesting point to note about this representation is that the distribution of the quantification, which in other treatments is always reflected in the syntactic structure of the representation, corresponds to a term of the representation language here. For this term we substitute expressions like (Ak,s:el(s)) to obtain a particular interpretation. will now how representations of the form (14) are constructed in the TENDUM system. The construction of quantification representation in the TENDUM system The TENDUM system uses a grammar consisting of phrase-structure rules augmented with semantic rules that construct a representation of a rewritphrase from those of its (see the sentence &apos;Five boats were lifted this works as follows. The number &apos;five&apos; is represented in the lexicon as an item of syntactic category &apos;number with representation &apos;5&apos;. To this item, a rule applies that constructsa syntactic structure of category numeral with representation 132 (AY:# (Y)=5), which I abbreviate as FIVE. To this structure a rule applies that constructs a syntactic structure of category&apos;determinee with representation (AX: (AP: ({xE d(FIVE,X): P(x) } )))) A rule constructing a syntactic structure of category&apos;noun phrase&apos; from a determiner and a nominal (inthe simplest case: a noun) applies to &apos;five&apos; and &apos;boats&apos;, combining their representations by applying (15) as a function to the noun representation BOATS. After A-conversion, this results in (A P : FIVE {xE d (FIVE, BOATS) : P (x) }) ) ) A rule constructing a sentence from a noun phrase and a verb applies to &apos;five boats&apos; and &apos;were lifted&apos;, combining their representations by applying (16) as a function to the verb representation LIFTED. After A-conversion, this results in (17): FIVE xE d (FIVE, BOATS) : P(x)1 ) ) Now suppose the sentence is interpreted relative to a domain of discourse where we have such boats and lifting facilities that it is impossible for more than one boat to be lifted at the same time. This is reflected in the fact that the RL predicate LIFTED is of such a type that it can only apply to individual boats. Assuming that the ambiguous BOATS has the single instance that LIFTED has the single instance (Az: LIFTED (z)), the instantiation rules, contype restrictions of RL, will produce the representation: (18) )) the instantiation process see in chapter 7.) This is readily seen to be equivalent to the more familiar form: (19) (x)}) = 5 If, in addition to, or instead of the distributive reading we want to generate another reading of the sentence, then we extend or modify the instantiation function for LIFTED accordingly. This shows how the analysis method generates the representations of only those interpretations which are relevant in a given domain of discourse, and does so without generating intermediate representations as artefacts of the use of a logical representation language.</abstract>

To tackle this problem, I have devised a method of representing quantified expressions in a logical language with the possibility of leaving certain quantification aspects open. This method has been implemented in the TENDUM dialogue system, developed jointly at the Institute for Perception Research in Eindhoven and the Computational Linguistics Research Unit at Tilburg University, Department of Linguistics (Bunt, 1982; 1983; Bunt &amp; thoe Schwartzenberg, 1982;). This method is not only of theoretical interest, but also provides a computationally efficient treatment of quantification. Ambiguity resolution In a semantic analysis system which translates natural language expressions into formal representations, all disambiguation takes place during this translation. 130 This applies both to purely lexical ambiguities and to structural ambiguities. For lexical disambiguation this means that a lexical item has several translations in the representation language (RL), which are all produced by a dictionary lookup a</context>

When we consider these questions for a sentence with a few noun phrases, we readily see that the sentence has a multitude of possible interpretations. Even a sentence with only one NP such as (1) Five boats were lifted has a variety of possible readings, depending on whether the boats were lifted individually, collectively, or in groups of five, and on whether the total number of boats involved is exactly five or at least five. For a sentence with two numerically quantified NPs, such as &apos;Three Russians visited five Frenchmen&apos;, Partee (1975) distinguished 8 readings depending on whether the Russians and the Frenchmen visited each other individually of collectively and on the relative scopes of the quantifiers. Partee&apos;s analysis is in fact still rather crude; a somewhat more refined analysis, which distinguished group readings and readings with equally wide scope of the quantifiers, leads to 30 interpretations (Bunt, in press). This presents a problem for any attempt at a precise and systematic description of semantic structures in natural language. On the one hand an articulate analysis of quantification is needed for obtaining t</context>

This method has been implemented in the TENDUM system, with an intermediate representation language that contains ambiguous constants corresponding to quantification aspects, in addition to ambiguous constants corresponding to nouns, verbs, etc. Quantification aspects The different aspects of quantification are closely related to the semantic functions of determiners. These functions depend on their syntactic position in a determiner sequence. A full-fledged basic noun phrase has the layout: (4) pre- + central + post- + head determiner determiner determiner noun (see Quirk et al., 1972, p.146). For example, in the NP (5) All my four children the centraldeterminer &apos;my&apos; restricts the range of reference of the head noun &apos;children&apos; to the set of my children; the predeterminer &apos;all&apos; indicates that a predicate, combined with the noun phrase to form a proposition, is associated with all the members of that set, and the postdeterminer &apos;four&apos; expresses the presupposition that the set consists of four elements. This set is determined by the central determiner plus the denotation of the head noun; I will call it the source of the quantification. In the case of an NP without central de</context>
