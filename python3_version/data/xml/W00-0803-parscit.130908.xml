In this paper, we investigate cross language
information retrieval (CUR) for Chinese
and Japanese texts utilizing the Han
characters — common ideographs used in
writing Chinese, Japanese and Korean (CJK)
languages. The Unicode encoding scheme,
which encodes the superset of Han
characters, is used as a common encoding
platform to deal with the multilingual
collection in a uniform manner. We discuss
the importance of Han character semantics
in document indexing and retrieval of the
ideographic languages. We also analyse the
baseline results of the cross language
information retrieval using the common Han
characters appeared in both Chinese and
Japanese texts.

Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999944020408164">
After the opening of the Cross Language
Information Retrieval (CUR) track in the
TREC-6 conference (TREC-1998), several
reports have been published on cross language
information retrieval in European languages, and
sometimes, European languages along with one
of the Asian languages (e.g., Chinese, Japanese
or Korean). However, no report is found in cross
language IR that focuses on the Asian languages
exclusively. In 1999, Pergamon published a
special issue of the journal, Information
Processing and Management focusing on
Information Retrieval with Asian Languages
(Pergamon-1999). Among the eight papers
included in that special issue, only one paper
addressed CLIR (Kim et al., 1999). Kim et al.
reported on multiple Asian language information
retrieval (English, Japanese and Korean CUR)
using multilingual dictionaries and machine
translation techniques (to translate both queries
and documents).
In TREC, intensive research efforts are made for
the European languages, for example, English,
German, French, Spanish, etc. Historically, these
languages share many similar linguistic
properties. However, exclusive focus on Asian
languages, for example, Chinese, Japanese and
Korean (CJK) - which also share significantly
similar linguistic properties, has not been given.
Enormous amount of CJK information is
currently on the Internet. The combined growth
rate of the CJK electronic information is also
predicted to be growing at a faster rate. Cross
language IR focusing on these Asian languages
is therefore inevitable.
In this paper, we investigate the potential of
indexing the semantically correlated Han
characters appear in both Chinese and Japanese
documents and queries to facilitate a cross
language information retrieval. Using Han
character oriented document and query vectors,
within the framework of the vector space
information retrieval, we then evaluate the
effectiveness of the cross language IR with
respect to their monolingual counterparts. We
conclude with a discussion about further
research possibilities and potentials of Han
character oriented cross language information
retrieval for the CJK languages.

1 Related Research and Motivation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999945533333333">
Several approaches are investigated in CJK text
indexing to address monolingual information
retrieval (MLIR) - for example, (1) indexing
single ideographic character, (2) indexing n-
gram&apos; ideographic characters and (3) indexing
words or phrases after segmentation and
morphological analysis. Monolingual infor-
mation retrieval (MLIR) of CJK languages is
further complicated with the fact that CJK texts
do not contain word delimiters (e.g., a blank
space after each word in English) to separate
words. From the un-delimited sequence of
characters, words must be extracted first (this
process is known as segmentation). For
inflectional ideographic language like Japanese,
morphological analysis must also be performed.
Sentences are segmented ins) words with the
help of a dictionary and using some machine
learning techniques. Morphological analysis also
needs intensive linguistic knowledge and
computer processing. Segmentation and
morphological analysis are tedious tasks and the
accuracy of the automatic segmentation and
morphological analysis drastically vary in
different domains. The word based indexing of
CJK texts is therefore computationally
expensive. Segmentation aad morphological
analysis related issues of both Chinese and
Japanese are intensively addressed elsewhere
(Sproat et al., 1996; Matsumcxo et al., 1997 and
many others).
The n-gram (n &gt;1) character based indexing is
computationally expensive as well. The number
of indexing terms (n-grams) increases drastically
as n increases. Moreover, not all the n-grams are
semantically meaningful &apos;words; therefore,
smoothing and filtering houristics must be
employed to extract linguistioally meaningful n-
grams for effective retrieval of information. See
Nie et al. (1996, 1998, 1999), Chen et al. (1997),
Fujii et al. (1993), Kim et al.1:1999) for details.
In contrast, indexing sinsle characters is
straightforward and less demnnding in terms of
both space and time. In single character
indexing, there is no need to (1) maintain a

multilingual dictionary or thesaurus of words,
(2) to extract word and morphemes, and (3) to
employ machine learning and smoothing to
prune the less important n-grams or ambiguity
resolution in word segmentation (Kwok, 1997;
Ogawa et al., 1997; Lee et al., 1999; etc.).
Moreover, a CUR system, based on Han
character semantics, incurs no translation
overhead for both queries and documents. In a
single character based CLIR approach for CJK
languages, some of the CLIR related problems
discussed in (Grefenstette, 1998) can also be
circumvented.
Comparison of experimental results in
monolingual IR using single character indexing,
n-gram character indexing and (segmented)
word indexing in Chinese information retrieval
is reported in Nie et al. (1996, 1998, 1999) and
Kwok (1997). For the case of monolingual
information retrieval (MLIR) task, in
comparison to the single character based
indexing approach, n-gram based and word
based approaches obtained better retrieval at the
cost of the extra time and space complexity.
Similar comparison and conclusion for Japanese
and Korean MLIR are made in Fujii et al. (1993)
and Lee et al. (1999), respectively.
Cross language information retrieval (CLIR,
Oard and Dorr, 1996) refers to the retrieval
when the query and the document collection are
in different languages. Unlike MLIR, in cross
language information retrieval, a great deal of
efforts is allocated in maintaining the
multilingual dictionary and thesaurus, and
translating the queries and documents, and so
on. There are other approaches to CLIR where
techniques like latent semantic indexing (LSI)
are used to automatically establish associations
between queries and documents independent of
language differences (Rehder et al., 1998).
Due to the special nature (ideographic, un-
delimited, etc.) of the CJK languages, the cross
language information retrieval of these
languages is extremely complicated. Probably,
this is the reason why only a few reports are
available so far in Cross Asian Language
Information Retrieval (CALIR).

Tan and Nagao (1995) used correlated Han
characters to align Japanese-Chinese bilingual
texts. According to them, the occurrence of
common Han characters (in Japanese and
Chinese language texts) sometimes is so
prevalent that even a monolingual reader could
perform a partial alignment of the bilingual
texts.
One of the authors of this paper is not a native
speaker of Chinese or Japanese but has the
intermediate level proficiency in both languages
now. However, before learning Japanese, based
on the familiar Han characters (their visual
similarity and therefore, the semantic relation)
appeared in the Japanese texts, the author could
roughly comprehend the theme of the articles
written in Japanese. This is due to the fact that
unlike Latin alphabets, Han characters capture
significant semantic information in them. Since
document retrieval is inherently a task of
semantic distinction between queries and
documents, Han character based CUR approach
can therefore be justified. It is worthy to mention
here that the pronunciation of the Han characters
varies significantly across the CJK languages,
but the visual appearance of the Han characters
in written texts (across CJK language) retains
certain level of similarity.
As discussed above, we can make use of the
non-trivial semantic information encoded within
the ideographic characters to find associations
between queries and documents across the
languages and perform cross language
information retrieval. By doing so, we can avoid
complicated segmentation or morphological
analysis process. At the same time, multilingual
dictionary and thesaurus lookup, and query-
documents translations can also be
circumvented.
In our research, we index single Han characters
(common and/or semantically related) appeared
in both Japanese and Chinese texts to model a
new simplistic CUR for Japanese and Chinese
cross language information retrieval. CJK
languages use a significant number of common
(or similar) Han characters in writing. Although
some ambiguities2 exist in the usage of Han

characters across the languages, there are
obvious contextual and semantic associations in
the usage of Han characters in the written texts
across the CJK languages (Tan and Nagao,
1995).
2 Encoding scenarios of CNC languages
Character encoding schemes of CJK languages
have several variations (e.g., Chinese: GB and
BIG-5, etc.; Japanese: ITS, EUC, etc.)3. The
number of Han characters encoded under a
particular encoding scheme also varies.
However, due to the continuous acceptance and
popularity of the Unicode (Unicode-2000) by
the computer industry, we have a way to
investigate these languages comprehensively.
The Common CJK Ideograph section of the
Unicode encoding scheme includes all
characters encoded in each individual language
and encoding scheme. Unicode version 3.0
assigned codes to 27,484 Han characters, a
superset of characters encoded in other popular
standards.

<bodyText confidence="0.980139380952381">
However, Unicode encoding is not a
linguistically based encoding scheme; it is rather
an initiative to cope with the variants of different
local standards. A critical analysis of Unicode
and a proposal of Multicode can be found in
Mudawwar (1997). Unicode standard avoids
duplicate encoding of the same character; for
example, the character &apos;a&apos; is encoded only once
although it is being used in several western
languages. However, for ideographic characters,
such efforts failed to a certain extent due to the
variation of typeface used under different
situations and cultures. The characters in Figure
1, although they represent the same word (sword
in English), is given a unique code under
Unicode encoding scheme to satisfy the round-

sometimes asks users to specify not only the
language but also the encoding scheme (e.g.,
simplified (GB) or traditional Chinese (BIG-5)) for a
single language search.

trip criteria&apos;&apos;, that is, to allow round-trip
conversion between the sourct: standard (in this
case, JIS) and the Unicode. The 27,484 Han
characters encoded in Unicode, therefore,
includes semantic redundancy in both single-
language and multiple-language perspectives.
In the unified CJK ideograph section, Unicode
maintains redundancy to accommodate
typographical or cultural corrpatibility because
the design goal of Unicode i s mainly to attain
compatibility with the existing corporate and
national encoding standards. In a Han character
based CLIR approach, such redundancy and
multiplicity must be identified and resolved to
achieve semantic uniformity and association.
Such multiplicity resolution tasks, with compare
to maintaining multilingual (word) dictionaries,
are less painstaking. In our Han character based
CLIR, we use a table lookup rnapping approach
to resolve semantic ambiguities of the Han
characters and associate the seinantically related
ideographs within and across CJK languages, as
a preprocessing task.

Chinese text is written homogeneously using
only Han characters. That are no word
delimiters and therefore, segmentation must be
performed to extract words from the string of
Han characters. Chinese is a non-inflectional
language and therefore morphological analysis is
not essential.
In contrast, Japanese text is written usually as a
mixture of Han characters,, Hiragana and
Katakana. ICatakana is usually used to write non-
Japanese words (except those borrowed from
Chinese). Hiragana is mostly used to represent
the inflectional part of a word and to substitute
complicated (and less common) Han characters
in modem Japanese. JapaniSse texts are also
written without word delimiters and therefore,
must be segmented. Prior t O any word based
indexing, due to the inflOctional nature of
Japanese, text must be morphologically analyzed

(equivalent to the stemming in western
languages) to cope with the inflectional
variations.
Due to the historical evolution and cultural
differences, Han character itself become
ambiguous across the CJK languages. We will
discuss the semantic irregularities of Han
characters in Japanese and Chinese below with
examples.
Han Characters: In Japanese, the ideographic
character-string, 2J* means postal stamp. The
constituent characters, if used independently in
other contexts, represent &amp;quot;to cut&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;hand&amp;quot;,
respectively. However, in Chinese, ea
represents postal stamp and the constituent
characters represent &amp;quot;postal&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;ticket&amp;quot;,
respectively. Interestingly, both in Japanese and
in Chinese, the character string, NEN,
represents post office. However, majority of the
postal service related words, in both Chinese and
Japanese, consist of the Han character, *IS as a
component. Although there are some
idiosyncrasies, there are significant regularities
in the usage of Han characters across the CJK
languages. Like word sense disambiguation
(WSD), ICanji Sense Disambiguation (KSD)
within and across the CJK languages is an
interesting area of research by itself. Lua (1995)
reported an interesting neural network based
experiment to predict the meaning of Han
character based words using their constituent
characters&apos; semantics.
For effective CLIR, we need to analyze the
irregular Han characters and work out relevant
mapping algorithm to augment the query and
document vectors. A simplistic approach (with
binary weight) is illustrated in Table 1. For the
partial co-occurrences of the characters like, VI,
and 0, etc. in a particular document or a
query requires adjustments of the document or
the query vector. We are aware that such manual
modification is not feasible for a large
heterogeneous document collection.
Dimensionality reduction techniques, like LSI
(Evans at al., 1998; Rehder et al, 1998) or Han
character clustering are the potential solutions to
automatically discover associations among Han
characters.

technological domain, Katakana is
predominantly used to transliterate foreign
words. For example, in modern Japanese, the
words, &apos;/—)I.. and 5- 11:1:)—, etc. (tool
and technology, respectively) are very common.
Their Han character equivalents are apl and
41*, etc., and they are similar to those used in
Chinese. A Katakana to Kanji (Han character)
mapping table is created to transfer the
semantics of Katakana in the form of Han
characters (relative positions of the document or
query vector need to be adjusted) to help our
Chinese-Japanese CLIR task. In this purpose,
the definition part of a Japanese monolingual
dictionary is used to find the relevant Han
characters for a particular Katakana string.
Manual correction is then conducted to retain the
meaningful Han character(s).
Proper Names: In Japanese, foreign proper
names are consistently written in Katakana.
However, in Chinese, they are written in Han
characters. For a usable CLIR system for
Chinese and Japanese, a mapping table is
therefore inevitable. In our experiment, due to
the nature of the text collection, we manually
edited the small number of proper names to
establish association. We are aware that such
manual approach is not feasible for large scale
CLIR task. However, since proper name
detection and manipulation is itself a major
research issue for natural language processing,
we will not address it here.
Hiragana Strings: Continuous long strings of
Hiragana need to be located and replaced5 with
the respective Han characters, and the document
and the query vectors must be adjusted
accordingly. Shorter hiragana strings can be
ignored as stop word since such hiragana strings
are mostly functional words or inflectional
attributes.

<bodyText confidence="0.99997840625">
The most popular IR model, the Vector Space
Model, uses vectors to represent documents and
queries. Each element of a document or a query
vector represents the presence or absence of a
particular term (binary), or the weight (entropy,
frequency, etc.). Functional words are
eliminated; stemming and other preprocessing
are also done prior to the vectorization. As a
result, syntactic information is lost. The vector
simply consists of an ordered list of terms, and
therefore, the contextual cues have also
disappeared. The document and the query
vectors are gross approximation of the original
document or query (Salton et al., 1983). In
vector space information retrieval, we sacrifice
syntactic, contextual and other information for
representational and computational simplicity.
For western languages, sometimes phrase
indexing is proposed to offset such losses and to
achieve better retrieval quality. In vector space
model, a term usually refers to a word. For
western languages, a document or a query vector
constructed from the letters of the alphabets
would not yield any effective retrieval.
However, representing CJK documents and
query in terms of Han character vectorization
yields reasonably effective retrieval. This is due
to the fact that a Han character encodes non-
trivial semantics information within itself, which
is crucial for information retrieval. Han
Character based document and query
representation is therefore justified. For CLIR,

We collected the translated versions of the
Lewis Carroll&apos;s &amp;quot;Alice&apos;s AVventure in the
Wonderland&amp;quot; in Japanese and in Chinese. The
original Chinese version (in (iE code) and the
original Japanese version (in S-MS code) are
then converted into Unicode. Preprocessing is
also conducted to correlate the proper names, to
resolve the semantic multiplicity of coding and
to associate the language specific irregularities,
etc. as described in Section 2 and 3.
The mg system (a public domain indexing
system from the New Zealand Digital Library
project, Witten et al., 1999) is adapted to handle
Unicode and used to index the Unicode files. We
consider each paragraph of tho book as a single
document. There are 835 paragraphs in the
original book and the translated versions in both
Japanese and Chinese also preserve the total
number of paragraphs. In this way, we have a
collection of 1670 paragraphs (hereafter, we
refer to each paragraph as a document of our
bilingual text collection) in both Chinese and
Japanese. We used the mg system to index the
collection based on TRIDF weighting. For a
particular query the mg system is used to
retrieve documents in order of relevance.
We asked 2 native Japanese who have an
intermediate level understanding of Chinese
language and who are the frequent users of the
Internet search engines, to formulate 5 queries
each in natural Japanese. S Imilarly, we also
asked 2 native Chinese who have the
intermediate level understanding of Japanese
and who are the frequent users of the Internet, to
formulate 5 queries each in Chinese. Therefore,
4 bilingual human subjects formulated a total of
20 queries in their respective native tongue (10
queries in Chinese and 10 quinies in Japanese).
The subjects were initially not told about the
cross language issues involved in the
experimental process, that is, the subjects
formulated the queries as how they would
usually do for monolingual information
retrieval.
All the 4 subjects are familiar with the story of
the Alice&apos;s Adventure in the Wonderland.
However, we asked them to take a quick look at
the electronic version of the book in their own
language to help them to formulate 5 different
queries in their own native language.

As shown in Table 2, it can be concluded that
the cross language information retrieval in this

Cross language information retrieval of
European languages, with the help of
multilingual thesaurus enhancement reaches
about 75% performance of their monolingual
counterparts (Eichman et al., 1998). The
effectiveness of Han character based CLIR for
CJK languages is therefore promising. It is
important to note here that in business, political
and natural science domains, Han characters are
prevalently correlated across Japanese and
Chinese documents. Our approach should
perform even better if applied in those domains.

6 Further Research
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999995224489796">
In our experiment, we represent Chinese and
Japanese documents and queries as weighted
vectors of Han Characters. Before the
vectorisation, necessary preprocessing is done to
cope with the multiplicity of coding problem of
semantically similar ideographs and to cope with
some obvious language specific issues. Same as
the monolingual vector space information
retrieval approach, we measured cosine
similarity between a query and a document to
retrieve relevant documents in order of
relevance. Similarity is measured for both cases;
that is, (1) monolingual: the query and the
document are in the same language, and (2)
cross-language: the query and the document are
of different languages. The comparative result
shows that the effectiveness of cross language
information retrieval between Chinese and
Japanese in this way is comparable to that of
other CLIR experiments conducted mainly with
multiple western languages with the help of
thesauri and machine translation techniques.
One of the promising applications of this
approach can be in identifying and aligning
Chinese and Japanese documents online. For
example, retrieving relevant news articles
published in both languages from the Internet. It
is understood that several mathematical
techniques, like Han character clustering and
dimensionality reduction techniques (Evans et
al., 1998) can augment and automate the process
of finding associations among the Han
characters within and across the CJK languages.
The vector space model is also flexible for the
adjustment of weighting scheme. Therefore, we
can flexibly augment the Han character based
query vectors (a pseudo- query expansion
techniques) and document vectors (a pseudo-
relevance feedback technique) for effective
CLIR. We left these parts as our immediate
future work.
As done with the ML1R, n-gram characters
based indexing can also be experimented.
However, due to the small document collection
and the number of queries we had, n-gram based
indexing suffers from data sparseness problem.
We, therefore, left out the n-gram character
based CLIR evaluation until a huge collection of
documents and queries are ready.

Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999744454545455">
In this paper, we experimented on a small
collection of homogeneous bilingual texts and a
small set of queries. The result obtained supports
the promising aspect of using Han characters for
cross language information retrieval of CJK
languages. Such an approach has its own
advantage since no translation of query or
documents are needed. In comparison to
maintaining multilingual dictionaries or thesauri,
maintaining Han characters mapping table is
more effective because the mapping table needs
not to be updated so often. Sophisticated
mathematical analysis of Han characters can
bring a new dimension in retrieving cross Asian
language information. Kanji Sense
Disambiguation (KSD) techniques using
advanced machine learning techniques can make
the proposed CLIR method more effective. KSD
is a long neglected area of research.

<abstract confidence="0.9989445">In this paper, we investigate cross language information retrieval (CUR) for Chinese and Japanese texts utilizing the Han characters — common ideographs used in writing Chinese, Japanese and Korean (CJK) languages. The Unicode encoding scheme, which encodes the superset of Han characters, is used as a common encoding platform to deal with the multilingual collection in a uniform manner. We discuss the importance of Han character semantics in document indexing and retrieval of the ideographic languages. We also analyse the baseline results of the cross language information retrieval using the common Han characters appeared in both Chinese and Japanese texts.</abstract>

Interestingly, both in Japanese and in Chinese, the character string, NEN, represents post office. However, majority of the postal service related words, in both Chinese and Japanese, consist of the Han character, *IS as a component. Although there are some idiosyncrasies, there are significant regularities in the usage of Han characters across the CJK languages. Like word sense disambiguation (WSD), ICanji Sense Disambiguation (KSD) within and across the CJK languages is an interesting area of research by itself. Lua (1995) reported an interesting neural network based experiment to predict the meaning of Han character based words using their constituent characters&apos; semantics. For effective CLIR, we need to analyze the irregular Han characters and work out relevant mapping algorithm to augment the query and document vectors. A simplistic approach (with binary weight) is illustrated in Table 1. For the partial co-occurrences of the characters like, VI, and 0, etc. in a particular document or a query requires adjustments of the document or the query vector. We are aware that such manual modification is not feasible</context>

A critical analysis of Unicode and a proposal of Multicode can be found in Mudawwar (1997). Unicode standard avoids duplicate encoding of the same character; for example, the character &apos;a&apos; is encoded only once although it is being used in several western languages. However, for ideographic characters, such efforts failed to a certain extent due to the variation of typeface used under different situations and cultures.

Comparison of experimental results in monolingual IR using single character indexing, n-gram character indexing and (segmented) word indexing in Chinese information retrieval is reported in Nie et al. (1996, 1998, 1999) and Kwok (1997). For the case of monolingual information retrieval (MLIR) task, in comparison to the single character based indexing approach, n-gram based and word based approaches obtained better retrieval at the cost of the extra time and space complexity. Similar comparison and conclusion for Japanese and Korean MLIR are made in Fujii et al. (1993) and Lee et al. (1999), respectively. Cross language information retrieval (CLIR, Oard and Dorr, 1996) refers to the retrieval when the query and the document collection are in different languages. Unlike MLIR, in cross language information retrieval, a great deal of efforts is allocated in maintaining the multilingual dictionary and thesaurus, and translating the queries and documents, and so on. There are other approaches to CLIR where techniques like latent semantic indexing (LSI) are used to automatically establish associations between queries and documents independent of language differences (Rehder et al., 19</context>

For effective CLIR, we need to analyze the irregular Han characters and work out relevant mapping algorithm to augment the query and document vectors. A simplistic approach (with binary weight) is illustrated in Table 1. For the partial co-occurrences of the characters like, VI, and 0, etc. in a particular document or a query requires adjustments of the document or the query vector. We are aware that such manual modification is not feasible for a large heterogeneous document collection. Dimensionality reduction techniques, like LSI (Evans at al., 1998; Rehder et al, 1998) or Han character clustering are the potential solutions to automatically discover associations among Han characters. 22 Table 1: Enhancement of query or document vectors to create semantic association (an example) Document or Query Vector Representation (partial) Han Characters appeared in a Japanese or a Chinese document or a query: [-VI. *.. Possible binary vectors [..l.. 1.. *.. *..[&apos; representing a query or [..*.. *.. 1.. 1..]&apos; a document etc. (before enhancement) Mapped binary vector [..1.. 1.. 1..

The number of Han characters encoded under a particular encoding scheme also varies. However, due to the continuous acceptance and popularity of the Unicode (Unicode-2000) by the computer industry, we have a way to investigate these languages comprehensively.

The original Chinese version (in (iE code) and the original Japanese version (in S-MS code) are then converted into Unicode. Preprocessing is also conducted to correlate the proper names, to resolve the semantic multiplicity of coding and to associate the language specific irregularities, etc. as described in Section 2 and 3. The mg system (a public domain indexing system from the New Zealand Digital Library project, Witten et al., 1999) is adapted to handle Unicode and used to index the Unicode files. We consider each paragraph of tho book as a single document. There are 835 paragraphs in the original book and the translated versions in both Japanese and Chinese also preserve the total number of paragraphs. In this way, we have a collection of 1670 paragraphs (hereafter, we refer to each paragraph as a document of our bilingual text collection) in both Chinese and Japanese. We used the mg system to index the collection based on TRIDF weighting. For a particular query the mg system is used to retrieve documents in order of re</context>
