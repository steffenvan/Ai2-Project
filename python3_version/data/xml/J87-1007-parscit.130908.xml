is the constant of the pumping lemma, the pumped
substring cannot be longer than k, and therefore the only
other place we might be able to pump would be in the
middle as and the middle cs. But this would result in
violating the condition that I may not be greater than i.
Thus, z cannot be pumped without violating the pumping
lemma, and hence (7) is not context free. Since
context-free languages are closed under intersection with
regular sets, it follows that (6) is not context-free either.
Since context-free languages are also closed under substi-
tution, this means that (5) is also not context-free. Final-
ly, since (5) is the intersection of English, with the
regular set (4), it follows that English, is not context-
free. Q.E.D.

tutions have not figured at all prominently, whereas homomor-

be helpful, therefore, to point out that a substitution is a mapping
like a homomorphism except that it is usually denoted by a rather
than h and that it may associate each element in the vocabulary of a
language with a whole set (possibly infinite) of strings rather than
with just one string, as in the case of a homomorphism. In the pres-
ent case, we needed to employ a (slightly more general kind of)
substitution in order to be able to associate the women with sing as
well as danced. It should also be noted that, while the man and the
women are linguistically analyzable, we have for technical conven-
ience treated them as single elements of the terminal vocabulary in
defining the substitutions.

A NOTE ON A STUDY OF CASES
This note describes and illustrates a study of deep
cases using a large sample of sentences. The purpose
of the note is to draw attention to the value of the
source material used for those interested in case-
based representations of sentence meaning, and to
indicate the potential utility of the study results.
The purpose of this note is to draw attention to the utility
of a specific source of data relevant to the use of case-
based meaning representations in language processing, by
illustrating the way we have exploited this source.
Like many others, we have used a language analyser
that builds meaning representations expressing semantic
case roles; specifically, Boguraev&apos;s (1979) analyser builds
dependency trees with word senses defined by semantic
category primitive formulae, and with case labels, i.e.,
semantic relation primitives, on the constituents of verb
(and some other) structures.
Using the analyser for more varied and demanding
purposes than Boguraev&apos;s original tests (see, e.g., Bogu-
raev and Sparck Jones 1983) left us dissatisfied with the
original set of case relations. We therefore carried out a
detailed analysis of a large sample of English sentences
to evaluate our proposals for a better-founded and more
comprehensive set of case relations. This study exploited
F.T. Wood&apos;s &amp;quot;English prepositional idioms&amp;quot; (Wood
1967), which provides a careful account, supported by
extensive examples, of the uses of English prepositions
and preposition-like terms. For instance,

Our study was intended to establish both the justifica-
tion for each case relation individually, by reference to a
range of sentences, and the plausibility of the set of
relations as a whole, by reference to the complete set of
sentences. Looking at Wood&apos;s description of a preposi-
tion&apos;s sense, and its accompanying illustration(s), we
tried to assign a case label to the link between the
sentence elements made by the preposition which we felt
captured the essential nature of that link, at the level of
generality represented by a set of 20-30 cases. Thus
&amp;quot;location&amp;quot; would be the label associated with a number
of specific space-relation prepositions, e.g., above, at, by.
The study was primarily concerned with prepositionally-

based cases, but we considered other case instantiations,
though not systematically. While additional cases might
therefore be motivated by non-prepositional sources we
have not examined, we believe that a complete set would
have to include something like our list, to cover prep-
ositions adequately.
The study was a purely investigative one; we were
interested in the legitimacy of the cases as characterisa-
tions of sentence relations, and did not address the ques-
tion of how the specific assignments, for the individual
sentences, could be achieved automatically. However, as
we had already demonstrated that a quite refined set of
cases could be applied by Boguraev&apos;s existing analyser,
and have since, as practical need has arisen, implemented
further cases, we feel some confidence in the feasibility
of automatic assignment of the cases in the present set.
(This of course accepts that some individual sentences
may present considerable difficulties.) We are neverthe-
less not offering our results here with any great claims
about the especial novelty or merits of our case set, but
rather as a practical contribution to the utilisation of case
labels, justified by the large and varied sentence sample
studied. Though domain-specific strategies may reduce
the need to handle lexical ambiguity, especially in nouns
and verbs but even in prepositions, it may nevertheless
be necessary even in the domain-specific case to provide
for distinct semantic functions in prepositions.
Wood&apos;s complete set of sentences is substantial; we
took one sentence for each straightforward sense defined
by Wood&apos;s numbering, omitting items labelled &amp;quot;phrases&amp;quot;
and with occasional modifications, e.g., to shorten
sentences. This gave us 421 sentences altogether, for 86
prepositions. As a result of our analysis we emerged with
28 cases. These are listed below with notes on the types
of source from which they may be derived, and (our)
examples showing both prepositional and non-preposi-
tional uses. This list is followed by illustrations from the
Wood sample.
In the list each case, or tag, name is prefaced by its
abbreviation. The meaning of the case is not explicitly
defined, but is assumed to be ostended by the subsequent
examples (and more particularly by the fuller sample
derived from Wood). Possible sources for the cases
include the lexicon and syntactic structures like embed-
ded clauses identified by the parsing program (and in our
analyser elements of structure identified by semantic
pattern matching). The normal linkage marked by a case
is between verb and noun group, but two nominal groups
may also be case-linked, and also more than two items
(though this is not common). In the illustrations we have
adopted the convention of marking the head words of the
two linked constituents by —. Thus the tag &amp;quot;after&amp;quot; labels
the relation between left and breakfast in John left
following breakfast, written as &amp;quot;John —left following
—breakfast&amp;quot;. In the cases where complete constituents
like embedded clauses fill case roles, they are bracketed
with [ ], and the whole item is marked with —. The cases
are alphabetically ordered here on their abbreviations.

Our treatment of the sample of sentences taken from
Wood is illustrated by the two selections below. These
show first the complete analyses for two prepositions,
and then the complete set of sentences for two cases.
The average number of sentences per case in the sample
is 15, with low variation. However, &amp;quot;location&amp;quot; has 80
sentences, reflecting the very large number of different
space-relation prepositions there are. It is possible that
more specific space-location cases would be desirable,
though the right level of discrimination and particular set
would not be easy to establish. We are, in any case, not
suggesting that the use of a case tag in the representation
of a sentence delivered by the analyser makes it unneces-
sary to indicate the specific lexical sense of the preposi-
tion.

Thus &amp;quot;location&amp;quot; would be the label associated with a number specific space-relation prepositions, e.g., at, by. study was primarily concerned with prepositionally- Computational Linguistics, Volume 13, Numbers 1-2, January-June 1987 65 Technical Correspondence A Note on a Study of Cases based cases, but we considered other case instantiations, though not systematically. While additional cases might therefore be motivated by non-prepositional sources we have not examined, we believe that a complete set would have to include something like our list, to cover prepositions adequately. The study was a purely investigative one; we were interested in the legitimacy of the cases as characterisations of sentence relations, and did not address the question of how the specific assignments, for the individual sentences, could be achieved automatically. However, as we had already demonstrated that a quite refined set of cases could be applied by Boguraev&apos;s existing analyser, and have since, as practical need has arisen, implemented further cases, we feel some confidence in the feasibility of automatic assignment of the cases in the present set. (This of course accepts that some individual sentences may present considerable difficulties.) We are nevertheless not offering our results here with any great claims about the especial novelty or merits of our case set, but rather as a practical contribution to the utilisation of case labels, justified by the large and varied sentence sample studied. Though domain-specific strategies may reduce the need to handle lexical ambiguity, especially in nouns and verbs but even in prepositions, it may nevertheless be necessary even in the domain-specific case to provide for distinct semantic functions in prepositions. Wood&apos;s complete set of sentences is substantial; we took one sentence for each straightforward sense defined by Wood&apos;s numbering, omitting items labelled &amp;quot;phrases&amp;quot; and with occasional modifications, e.g., to shorten sentences. This gave us 421 sentences altogether, for 86 prepositions. As a result of our analysis we emerged with 28 cases. These are listed below with notes on the types of source from which they may be derived, and (our) examples showing both prepositional and non-prepositional uses. This list is followed by illustrations from the Wood sample. the list each case, or is prefaced by its abbreviation. The meaning of the case is not explicitly defined, but is assumed to be ostended by the subsequent examples (and more particularly by the fuller sample derived from Wood). Possible sources for the cases include the lexicon and syntactic structures like embedded clauses identified by the parsing program (and in our analyser elements of structure identified by semantic pattern matching). The normal linkage marked by a case is between verb and noun group, but two nominal groups may also be case-linked, and also more than two items (though this is not common). In the illustrations we have adopted the convention of marking the head words of the two linked constituents by —. Thus the tag &amp;quot;after&amp;quot; labels relation between left breakfast, as &amp;quot;John —left following —breakfast&amp;quot;. In the cases where complete constituents like embedded clauses fill case roles, they are bracketed with [ ], and the whole item is marked with —.

Our treatment of the sample of sentences taken from Wood is illustrated by the two selections below. These show first the complete analyses for two prepositions, and then the complete set of sentences for two cases. The average number of sentences per case in the sample is 15, with low variation. However, &amp;quot;location&amp;quot; has 80 sentences, reflecting the very large number of different space-relation prepositions there are. It is possible that more specific space-location cases would be desirable, though the right level of discrimination and particular set would not be easy to establish. We are, in any case, not suggesting that the use of a case tag in the representation of a sentence delivered by the analyser makes it unnecessary to indicate the specific lexical sense of the preposition.
