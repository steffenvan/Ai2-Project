Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999946136363636">
The term word association is used in a very
particular sense in the psycholinguistic literature.
(Generally speaking, subjects respond quicker than
normal to the word &amp;quot;nurse&amp;quot; if it follows a highly
associated word such as &amp;quot;doctor.&amp;quot;) We will extend
the term to provide the basis for a statistical
description of a variety of interesting linguistic
phenomena, ranging from semantic relations of the
doctor/nurse type (content word/content word) to
lexico-syntactic co-occurrence constraints between
verbs and prepositions (content word/function
word). This paper will propose a new objective
measure based on the information theoretic notion
of mutual information, for estimating word
association norms from computer readable corpora.
(The standard method of obtaining word association
norms, testing a few thousand subjects on a few
hundred words, is both costly and unreliable.) The
proposed measure, the association ratio, estimates
word association norms directly from computer
readable corpora, making it possible to estimate
norms for tens of thousands of words.

It is common practice in linguistics to classify words
not only on the basis of their meanings but also on
the basis of their co-occurrence with other words.
Running through the whole Firthian tradition, for
example, is the theme that &amp;quot;You shall know a word
by the company it keeps&amp;quot; (Firth, 1957).
&amp;quot;On the one hand, bank co-occurs with words and expression

we find bank co-oorurring with river swim, boat, east (and
of course Wen and South, which have acquired special
meanings of their own), on top of the, and of the Rhine.&amp;quot;
[Hanks (1987), p. 127]
The search for increasingly delicate word classes is
not new. In lexicography, for example, it goes back
at least to the &amp;quot;verb patterns&amp;quot; described in Hornby&apos;s
Advanced Learner&apos;s Dictionary (first edition 1948).
What is new is that facilities for the computational
storage and analysis of large bodies of natural
language have developed significantly in recent
years, so that it is now becoming possible to test and

2. Practical Applications
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99992037037037">
The proposed statistical description has a large
number of potentially important applications,
including: (a) constraining the language model both
for speech recognition and optical character
recognition (OCR), (b) providing disambiguation
cues for parsing highly ambiguous syntactic
structures such as noun compounds, conjunctions,
and prepositional phrases, (c) retrieving texts from
large databases (e.g., newspapers, patents), (d)
enhancing the productivity of computational linguists
in compiling lexicons of lexico-syntactic facts, and
(e) enhancing the productivity of lexicographers in
identifying normal and conventional usage.
Consider the optical character recognizer (OCR)
application. Suppose that we have an OCR device
such as [Kahan, Pavlidis, Baird (1987)], and it has
assigned about equal probability to having
recognized &amp;quot;farm&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;form,&amp;quot; where the context is
either: (1) &amp;quot;federal credit&amp;quot; or (2) &amp;quot;some
of.&amp;quot; The proposed association measure can make
use of the fact that &amp;quot;farm&amp;quot; is much more likely in
the first context and &amp;quot;form&amp;quot; is much more likely in
the second to resolve the ambiguity. Note that
alternative disambiguation methods based on
syntactic constraints such as part of speech are
unlikely to help in this case since both &amp;quot;form&amp;quot; and
&amp;quot;farm&amp;quot; are commonly used as nouns.

3. Word Association and Psycholinguistics
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.986053413793103">
Word association norms are well known to be an
important factor in psycholinguistic research,
especially in the area of lexical retrieval. Generally
speaking, subjects respond quicker than normal to
the word &amp;quot;nurse&amp;quot; if it follows a highly associated
word such as &amp;quot;doctor.&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;Some results and implications are summarized from
reaction-time . experiments in which subjects either (a)
classified successive strings of letters as words and nonwords,
or (b) pronounced the strings. Both types of response to
words (e.g., BUTTER) were consistently faster when
preceded by associated words (e.g., BREAD) rather than
unassociated words (e.g. NURSE).&amp;quot; (Meyer, Schvaneveldt
and Ruddy (1975), p. 98)
Much of this psycholinguistic research is based on
empirical estimates of word association norms such
as [Palermo and Jenkins (1964)], perhaps the most
influential study of its kind, though extremely small
and somewhat dated. This study measured 200
words by asking a few thousand subjects to write
down a word after each of the 200 words to be
measured. Results are reported in tabular form,
indicating which words were written down, and by
how many subjects, factored by grade level and sex.
The word &amp;quot;doctor,&amp;quot; for example, is reported on pp.
98-100, to be most often associated with &amp;quot;nurse,&amp;quot;
followed by &amp;quot;sick,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;health,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;medicine,&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;hospital,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;man,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;sickness,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;lawyer,&amp;quot; and about
70 more words.

4. An Information Theoretic Measure
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999321875">
We propose an alternative measure, the association
ratio, for measuring word association norms, based
on the information theoretic concept of mutual
information. The proposed measure is more
objective and less costly than the subjective method
employed in [Palermo and Jenkins (1964)]. The
association ratio can be scaled up to provide robust
estimates of word association norms for a large
portion of the language. Using the association ratio
measure, the five most associated words are (in
order): &amp;quot;dentists,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;nurses,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;treating,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;treat,&amp;quot;
and &amp;quot;hospitals.&amp;quot;
What is &amp;quot;mutual information&amp;quot;? According to [Fano
(1961), p. 28], if two points (words), x and y, have
probabilities P(x) and P(y), then their mutual
information, /(x ,y), is defined to be
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.99548">
P(x,y)
1(x,y) &amp;quot; log2 P(x) P(y)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.998166783333334">
Informally, mutual information compares the prob-
ability of observing x and y together (the joint
probability) with the probabilities of observing x and
y independently (chance). If there is a genuine
association between x and y, then the joint
probability P(x,y) will be much larger than chance
P(x) P(y), and consequently 1(x,y) &gt;&gt; 0. If
there is no interesting relationship between x and y,
then P(x,y) P(x) P(y), and thus, 1(x,y)2-- 0.
If x and y are in complementary distribution, then
P(x,y) will be much less than P(x) P(y), forcing
1(x,y) &lt;&lt; 0.
In our application, word probabilities, P(x) and
P(y), are estimated by counting the number of
observations of x and y in a corpus, f(x) and f(y),
and normalizing by N, the size of the corpus. (Our
examples use a number of different corpora with
different sizes: 15 million words for the 1987 AP
corpus, 36 million words for the 1988 AP corpus,
and 8.6 million tokens for the tagged corpus.) Joint
probabilities, P(x,y), are estimated by counting the
number of times that x is followed by y in a window
of w words, f(x,y), and normalizing by N.
The window size parameter allows us to look at
different scales. Smaller window sizes will identify
fixed expressions (idioms) and other relations that
hold over short ranges; larger window sizes will
highlight semantic concepts and other relationships
that hold over larger scales. For the remainder of
this paper, the window size, w, will be set to 5
words as a compromise; this setting is large enough
to show some of the constraints between verbs and
arguments, but not so large that it would wash out
constraints that make use of strict adjacency.1
Since the association ratio becomes unstable when
the counts are very small, we will not discuss word
pairs with f(x,y) S 5. An improvement would make
use of t-scores, and throw out pairs that were not
significant. Unfortunately, this requires an estimate
of the variance of f(x,y), which goes beyond the
scope of this paper. For the remainder of this
paper, we will adopt the simple but arbitrary
threshold, and ignore pairs with small counts.
Technically, the association ratio is different from
mutual information in two respects. First, joint
probabilities are supposed to be symmetric:
P(x,y)= P(y,x), and thus, mutual information is
also symmetric: 1(x,y) = 1(y ,x). However, the
association ratio is not symmetric, since f(x,y)
encodes linear precedence. (Recall that f(x,y)
denotes the number of times that word x appears
before y in the window of w words, not the number
of times the two words appear in either order.)
Although we could fix this problem by redefining
f(x,y) to be symmetric (by averaging the matrix
with its transpose), we have decided not to do so,
since order information appears to be very
interesting. Notice the asymmetry in the pairs
below (computed from 36 million words of 1988 AP
text), illustrating a wide variety of biases ranging

be interesting to consider alternatives (e.g., a triangular
window or a decaying exponential) that would weight words
less and less as they are separated by more and more words.

doctors lawyers 25 16
bread butter 14 0
save life 106 8
save money 155 8
save from 144 16
supposed to 982 21
Secondly, one might expect f(x,y) _f(x) and
f(x,y) f(Y), but the way we have been counting,
this needn&apos;t be the case if x and y happen to appear
several times in the window. For example, given
the sentence, &amp;quot;Library workers were prohibited
from saving books from this heap of ruins,&amp;quot; which
appeared in an AP story on April 1, 1988,
f(prohibited) = 1 and f(prohibited, front) = 2.
This problem can be fixed by dividing f(x,y) by
w — 1 (which has the consequence of subtracting
log2(W — I) 2 from our association ratio
scores). This adjustment has the additional benefit
of assuring that f(x,y) = f(x)
= f(y) = N.
When 1(x ,y) is large, the association ratio produces
very credible results not unlike those reported in
[Palermo and Jenkins (1964)], as illustrated in the
table below. In contrast, when 1(x,y)=-&apos; 0, the pairs
less interesting. (As a very rough rule of thumb, we
have observed that pairs with 1(x,y)&gt; 3 tend to be
interesting, and pairs with smaller f(x,y) are
generally not. One can make this statement precise
by calibrating the measure with subjective measures.
Alternatively, one could make estimates of the
variance and then make statements about confidence
levels, e.g., with 95% confidence, P(x,y) &gt;
P(x) P(y).)

If 1(x ,y) &lt;&lt;0, we would predict that x and y are in
complementary distribution. However, we are
rarely able to observe 1(x,y)&lt;&lt;0 because our
corpora are too small (and our measurement
techniques are too crude). Suppose, for example,
that both x and y appear about 10 times per million
words of text. Then, P(x) P(y) 10-5 and
-
chance is P(x)P(x) = 10i0. Thus, to say that
/(x,y) is much less than 0, we need to say that
P(x,y) is much less than 10-1°, a statement that is
hard to make with much confidence given the size of
presently available corpora. In fact, we cannot
(easily) observe a probability less than
1/N 10-7, and therefore, it is hard to know if
I(x,y) is much less than chance or not, unless
chance is very large. (In fact, the pair (a, doctors)
above, appears significantly less often than chance.
But to justify this statement, we need to compensate
for the window size (which shifts the score
downward by 2.0, e.g. from 0.96 down to — 1.04)
and we need to estimate the standard deviation,
using a method such as [Good (1953)].)

5. Lexico-Syntactic Regularities
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99973637037037">
Although the psycholinguistic literature documents
the significance of noun/noun word associations such
as doctor/nurse in considerable detail, relatively little
is said about associations among verbs, function
words, adjectives, and other non-nouns. In addition
to identifying semantic relations of the doctor/nurse
variety, we believe the association ratio can also be
used to search for interesting lexico-syntactic
relationships between verbs and typical
arguments/adjuncts. The proposed association ratio
can be viewed as a formalization of Sinclair&apos;s
argument:
&amp;quot;How common are the phrasal verbs with set? Set is
particularly rich in making combinations with words like
about. in. up, out. on, off, and these words are themselves
very common. How likely is set off to occur? Both are
frequent words; (set occurs approximately 250 times in a
million words and) off occurs approximately 556 times in a
million words... [The question we are asking can be
roughly rephrased as follows: how likely is off to occur
immediately after set? ... This is 0.00025 x0.00055
[P(s) P(y)], which gives us the tiny figure of 0.0000001375
... The assumption behind this calculation is that the words
are distributed at random in a text [at chance, in our
terminology). It is obvious to a linguist that this is not so,
and a rough measure of how much set and off attract each
other is to compare the probability with what actually
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.991848">

<bodyText confidence="0.984584052631579">
happens... Set off occurs nearly 70 times in the 7.3 million
word corpus [P(x,y).0701(7.3 106) &gt;&gt; P(x) P(y)].
That is enough to show its main patterning and it suggests
that in currently-held corpora there will be found sufficient
evidence for the descliption of a substantial collection of
phrases... [Sinclair (1987)e. pp. 151-152]
It happens that set ... off was found 177 times in the
1987 AP Corpus of approximately 15 million words,
about the same number of occurrences per million as
Sinclair found in his (mainly British) corpus.
Quantitatively, 1( set ,o ff ) = 5.9982, indicating that
the probability of set ... off is almost 64 times
greater than chance. This association is relatively
strong; the other particles that Sinclair mentions
have association ratios of: about (1.4), in (2.9), up
(6.9), out (4.5), on (3.3)in the 1987 AP Corpus.
As Sinclair suggests, the approach is well suited for
identifying phrasal verbs. However, phrasal verbs
involving the preposition to raise an interesting
problem because of the possible confusion with the
infinitive marker to. We have found that if we first
tag every word in the corpus with a part of speech
using a method such as [Church (1988)], and then
measure associations between tagged words, we can
identify interesting contrasts between verbs
associated with a following preposition to/in and
verbs associated with a following infinitive marker
to/to. (Part of speech notation is borrowed from
[Francis and Kucera (1982)]; in = preposition; to =
infinitive marker; vb = bare verb; vbg = verb +
ing; vbd = verb + ed; vbz = verb + s; vbn = verb
+ en.) The association ratio identifies quite a
number of verbs associated in an interesting way
with to; restricting our attention to pairs with a
score of 3.0 or more, there are 768 verbs associated
with the preposition to/in and 551 verbs with the
infinitive marker to/to. The ten verbs found to be
most associated before to/in are:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.936133428571428">
• to/in: alluding/vbg, adhere/vb, amounted/vbn, re-

ing/vbg, tried/vbd, enabling/vbg, tends/vbz,

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999825">
Thus, we see there is considerable leverage to be
gained by preprocessing the corpus and manipulating
the inventory of tokens. For measuring syntactic
constraints, it may be useful to include some part of
speech information and to exclude much of the
internal structure of noun phrases. For other
purposes, it may be helpful to tag items and/or
phrases with semantic labels such as *person*,
*place*, *time*, *body-part*, *bad*, etc. Hindle
(personal communication) has found it helpful to
preprocess the input with the Fidditch parser [Hindle
(1983a,b)] in order to identify associations between
verbs and arguments, and postulate semantic classes
for nouns on this basis.

6. Applications in Lexicography
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999853177777778">
Large machine-readable corpora are only just now
becoming available to lexicographers. Up to now,
lexicographers have been reliant either on citations
collected by human readers, which introduced an
element of selectivity and so inevitably distortion
(rare words and uses were collected but common
uses of common words were not), or on small
corpora of only a million words or so, which are
reliably informative for only the most common uses
of the few most frequent words of English. (A
million-word corpus such as the Brown Corpus is
reliable, roughly, for only some uses of only some of
the forms of around 4000 dictionary entries. But
standard dictionaries typically contain twenty times
this number of entries.)
The computational tools available for studying
machine-readable corpora are at present still rather
primitive. There are concordancing programs (see
Figure 1 at the end of this paper), which are
basically KWIC (key word in context [Aho,
Kernighan, and Weinberger (1988), p. 122]) indexes
with additional features such as the ability to extend
the context, sort leftwards as well as rightwards,
and so on. There is very little interactive software.
In a typical situation in the lexicography of the
1980s, a lexicographer is given the concordances for
a word, marks up the printout with colored pens in
order to identify the salient senses, and then writes
syntactic descriptions and definitions.
Although this technology is a great improvement on
using human readers to collect boxes of citation
index cards (the method Murray used in
constructing the Oxford English Dictionary a
century ago), it works well if there are no more
than a few dozen concordance lines for a word, and
only two or three main sense divisions. In
analyzing a complex word such as &amp;quot;take&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;save&amp;quot;,
or &amp;quot;from&amp;quot;, the lexicographer is trying to pick out
significant patterns and subtle distinctions that are
buried in literally thousands of concordance lines:
pages and pages of computer printout. The unaided
human mind simply cannot discover all the
significant patterns, let alone group them and rank
in order of importance.
The AP 1987 concordance to &amp;quot;save&amp;quot; is many pages

It is hard to know what is important in such a
concordance and what is not. For example,
although it is easy to see from the concordance
selection in Figure 1 that the word &amp;quot;to&amp;quot; often comes
before &amp;quot;save&amp;quot; and the word &amp;quot;the&amp;quot; often comes after
&amp;quot;save,&amp;quot; it is hard to say from examination of a
concordance alone whether either or both of these
co-occurrences have any significance.
Two examples will be illustrate how the association
ratio measure helps make the analysis both quicker
and more accurate.

The association ratios (above) show that association
norms apply to function words as well as content
words. For example, one of the words significantly
associated with &amp;quot;save&amp;quot; is &amp;quot;from&amp;quot;. Many
dictionaries, for example Merriam-Webster&apos;s Ninth,
make no explicit mention of &amp;quot;from&amp;quot; in the entry for
&amp;quot;save&amp;quot;, although British learners&apos; dictionaries do
make specific mention of &amp;quot;from&amp;quot; in connection with
&amp;quot;save&amp;quot;. These learners&apos; dictionaries pay more
attention to language structure and collocation than
do American collegiate dictionaries, and
lexicographers trained in the British tradition are
often fairly skilled at spotting these generalizations.
However, teasing out such facts, and distinguishing
true intuitions from false intuitions takes a lot of
time and hard work, and there is a high probability
of inconsistencies and omissions.

&amp;quot;Save ... from&amp;quot; is a good example for illustrating
the advantages of the association ratio. Save is
ranked 319th in this list, indicating that the
association is modest, strong enough to be important
(21 times more likely than chance), but not so
strong that it would pop out at us in a concordance,
or that it would be one of the first things to come to

6.2 Example 2: Identifying Semantic Classes
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998449670886076">
Having established the relative importance of &amp;quot;save
... from&amp;quot;, and having noted that the two words are
rarely adjacent, we would now like to speed up the
labor-intensive task of categorizing the concordance
lines. Ideally, we would like to develop a set of
semi-automatic tools that would help a lexicographer
produce something like Figure 2, which provides an
annotated summary of the 65 concordance lines for
&amp;quot;save ... from.&amp;quot;2 The &amp;quot;save ... from&amp;quot; pattern occurs
in about 10% of the 666 concordance lines for
&amp;quot;save.&amp;quot;
Traditionally, semantic categories have been only
vaguely recognized, and to date little effort has been
devoted to a systematic classification of a large
corpus. Lexicographers have tended to use
concordances impressionistically; semantic theorist,
AI-ers, and others have concentrated on a few
interesting examples, e.g., &amp;quot;bachelor,&amp;quot; and have not
given much thought to how the results might be
scaled up.
With this concern in mind, it seems reasonable to
ask how well these 65 lines for &amp;quot;save ... from&amp;quot; fit
in with all other uses of &amp;quot;save&amp;quot;? A laborious
concordance analysis was undertaken to answer this
question. When it was nearing completion, we
noticed that the tags that we were inventing to
capture the generalizations could in most cases have
been suggested by looking at the lexical items listed
in the association ratio table for &amp;quot;save&amp;quot;. For
example, we had failed to notice the significance of
time adverbials in our analysis of &amp;quot;save,&amp;quot; and no
2. The last unclassified line, &amp;quot;...save shoppers anywhere from
SSD...&amp;quot; raises interesting problems. Syntactic &amp;quot;chunking&amp;quot;
shows that, in spite of its co-occurrence of &amp;quot;from&amp;quot; with
&amp;quot;save&amp;quot;, this line does not belong here. An intriguing exercise,
given the lookup table we are trying to construct, is how to
guard against false inferences such as that since &amp;quot;shoppers&amp;quot; is
tagged (PERSON]. &amp;quot;$SO to $500&amp;quot; must here count an either
BAD or a LOCATION. Accidental coincidences of this kind
do not have a significant effect on the measure, however,
although they do serve u a reminder of the probabilistic
nature of the findings.
dictionary records this. Yet it should be clear from
the association ratio table above that &amp;quot;annually&amp;quot; and
&amp;quot;month&amp;quot;3 are commonly found with &amp;quot;save&amp;quot;. More
detailed inspection shows that the time adverbials
correlate interestingly with just one group of &amp;quot;save&amp;quot;
objects, namely those tagged [MONEY]. The AP
wire is full of discussions of &amp;quot;saving $1.2 billion per
month&amp;quot;; computational lexicography should measure
and record such patterns if they are general, even
when traditional dictionaries do not.
As another example illustrating how the association
ratio tables would have helped us analyze the &amp;quot;save&amp;quot;
concordance lines, we found ourselves contemplating
the semantic tag ENV(IRONMENT) in order to
analyze lines such as:
the trend to save the forests[ENV]
it&apos;s our turn to save the lake[ENV],
joined a fight to save their forests[ENV],
can we get busy to save the planet[ENV]?
If we had looked at the association ratio tables
before labeling the 65 lines for &amp;quot;save ... from,&amp;quot; we
might have noticed the very large value for &amp;quot;save ...
forests,&amp;quot; suggesting that there may be an important
pattern here. In fact, this pattern probably
subsumes most of the occurrences of the &amp;quot;save
[ANIMAL)&amp;quot; pattern noticed in Figure 2. Thus,
tables do not provide semantic tags, but they
provide a powerful set of suggestions to the
lexicographer for what needs to be accounted for in
choosing a set of semantic tags.
It may be that everything said here about &amp;quot;save&amp;quot;
and other words is true only of 1987 American
journalese. Intuitively, however, many of the
patterns discovered seem to be good candidates for
conventions of general English. A future step
would be to examine other more balanced corpora
and test how well the patterns hold up.

We began this paper with the psycholinguistic notion

toward the information theoretic definition of
mutual information. This provided a precise

but on closer examination it is clear that this use of &amp;quot;time&amp;quot;
(e.g., &amp;quot;to save time&amp;quot;) counts as something like a commodity or
resource, not as part of a time adjunct. Such are the pitfalls of
lexicography (obvious when they are pointed out).

large corpus of text in order to produce a table of
associations for tens of thousands of words. We
were then able to show that the table encoded a
number of very interesting patterns ranging from
doctor ... nurse to save ... from. We finally
concluded by showing how the patterns in the
association ratio table might help a lexicographer
organize a concordance.
In point of fact, we actually developed these results
in basically the reverse order. Concordance analysis
is still extremely labor-intensive, and prone to errors
of omission. The ways that concordances are sorted
don&apos;t adequately support current lexicographic
practice. Despite the fact that a concordance is
indexed by a single word, often lexicographers
actually use a second word such as &amp;quot;from&amp;quot; or an
equally common semantic concept such as a time
adverbial to decide how to categorize concordance
lines. In other words, they use two words to
triangulate in on a word sense. This triangulation
approach clusters concordance lines together into
word senses based primarily on usage (distributional
evidence), as opposed to intuitive notions of
meaning. Thus, the question of what is a word
sense can be addressed with syntactic methods
(symbol pushing), and need not address semantics
(interpretation), even though the inventory of tags
may appear to have semantic values.
The triangulation approach requires &amp;quot;art.&amp;quot; How
does the lexicographer decide which potential cut
points are &amp;quot;interesting&amp;quot; and which are merely due to
chance? The proposed association ratio score
provides a practical and objective measure which is
often a fairly good approximation to the &amp;quot;art.&amp;quot;
Since the proposed measure is objective, it can be
applied in a systematic way over a large body of
material, steadily improving consistency and
productivity.
But on the other hand, the objective score can be
misleading. The score takes only distributional
evidence into account. For example, the measure
favors &amp;quot;set ... for&amp;quot; over &amp;quot;set ... down&amp;quot;; it doesn&apos;t
know that the former is less interesting because its
semantics are compositional. In addition, the
measure is extremely superficial; it cannot cluster
words into appropriate syntactic classes without an
explicit preprocess such as Church&apos;s parts program
&apos;or Hindle&apos;s parser. Neither of these preprocesses,
though, can help highlight the &amp;quot;natural&amp;quot; similarity
between nouns such as &amp;quot;picture&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;photograph.&amp;quot;
Although one might imagine a preprocess that would
help in this particular case, there will probably
always be a class of generalizations that are obvious
to an intelligent lexicographer, but lie hopelessly
beyond the objectivity of a computer.
Despite these problems, the association ratio could
be an important tool to aid the lexicographer, rather
like an index to the concordances. It can help us
decide what to look for; it provides a quick
summary of what company our words do keep.

(Generally speaking, subjects respond quicker than normal to the word &amp;quot;nurse&amp;quot; if it follows a highly associated word such as &amp;quot;doctor.&amp;quot;) We will extend the term to provide the basis for a statistical description of a variety of interesting linguistic phenomena, ranging from semantic relations of the doctor/nurse type (content word/content word) to lexico-syntactic co-occurrence constraints between verbs and prepositions (content word/function word).

The measure, association ratio, word association norms directly from computer readable corpora, making it possible to estimate norms for tens of thousands of words. 1. Meaning and Association common practice in linguistics to classify words not only on the basis of their meanings but also on the basis of their co-occurrence with other words. Running through the whole Firthian tradition, for example, is the theme that &amp;quot;You shall know a word by the company it keeps&amp;quot; (Firth, 1957). the one hand, with words and expression u notes, loan, account, investment, clerk. manager, robbery, vaults, working in a, National. of England. so forth.

Practical Applications The proposed statistical description has a large number of potentially important applications, including: (a) constraining the language model both for speech recognition and optical character recognition (OCR), (b) providing disambiguation cues for parsing highly ambiguous syntactic structures such as noun compounds, conjunctions, and prepositional phrases, (c) retrieving texts from large databases (e.g., newspapers, patents), (d) enhancing the productivity of computational linguists in compiling lexicons of lexico-syntactic facts, and (e) enhancing the productivity of lexicographers in identifying normal and conventional usage. Consider the optical character recognizer (OCR) application. Suppose that we have an OCR device such as [Kahan, Pavlidis, Baird (1987)], and it has assigned about equal probability to having recognized &amp;quot;farm&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;form,&amp;quot; where the context is either: (1) &amp;quot;federal credit&amp;quot; or (2) &amp;quot;some of.&amp;quot; The proposed association measure can make use of the fact that &amp;quot;farm&amp;quot; is much more likely in the first context and &amp;quot;form&amp;quot; is much more likely in the second to resolve the ambiguity. Note that alternative disambiguation methods based on syntactic constraints such as part of speech are unlikely to help in this case since both &amp;quot;form&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;farm&amp;quot; are commonly used as nouns. 3. Word Association and Psycholinguistics Word association norms are well known to be an important factor in psycholinguistic research, especially in the area of lexical retrieval. Generally speaking, subjects respond quicker than normal to the word &amp;quot;nurse&amp;quot; if it follows a highly associated word such as &amp;quot;doctor.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Some results and implications are summarized from reaction-time . experiments in which subjects either (a) classified successive strings of letters as words and nonwords, or (b) pronounced the strings. Both types of response to words (e.g., BUTTER) were consistently faster when preceded by associated words (e.g., BREAD) rather than unassociated words (e.g. NURSE).&amp;quot; (Meyer, Schvaneveldt and Ruddy (1975), p. 98) Much of this psycholinguistic research is based on empirical estimates of word association norms such as [Palermo and Jenkins (1964)], perhaps the most influential study of its kind, though extremely small and somewhat dated. This study measured 200 words by asking a few thousand subjects to write down a word after each of the 200 words to be measured. Results are reported in tabular form, indicating which words were written down, and by how many subjects, factored by grade level and sex. The word &amp;quot;doctor,&amp;quot; for example, is reported on pp. 98-100, to be most often associated with &amp;quot;nurse,&amp;quot; followed by &amp;quot;sick,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;health,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;medicine,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;hospital,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;man,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;sickness,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;lawyer,&amp;quot; and about 70 more words. 4. An Information Theoretic Measure propose an alternative measure, association measuring word association norms, based the information theoretic concept of proposed measure is more objective and less costly than the subjective method employed in [Palermo and Jenkins (1964)]. The association ratio can be scaled up to provide robust estimates of word association norms for a large portion of the language. Using the association ratio measure, the five most associated words are (in order): &amp;quot;dentists,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;nurses,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;treating,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;treat,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;hospitals.&amp;quot; What is &amp;quot;mutual information&amp;quot;? According to [Fano p. 28], if two points (words), their mutual ,y), defined to be log2 P(y) Informally, mutual information compares the probof observing together (the with the probabilities of observing independently If there is a genuine between the joint be much larger than chance P(y), consequently &gt;&gt; If is no interesting relationship between P(x) P(y), thus, 0. are complementary distribution, then be much less than P(y), &lt;&lt; our application, word probabilities, are by counting the number of of y in a corpus, normalizing by size of the corpus. (Our examples use a number of different corpora with different sizes: 15 million words for the 1987 AP corpus, 36 million words for the 1988 AP corpus, and 8.6 million tokens for the tagged corpus.) Joint are estimated counting the of times that x is followed by in window w words, normalizing by The window size parameter allows us to look at different scales. Smaller window sizes will identify fixed expressions (idioms) and other relations that hold over short ranges; larger window sizes will highlight semantic concepts and other relationships that hold over larger scales. For the remainder of this paper, the window size, w, will be set to 5 words as a compromise; this setting is large enough to show some of the constraints between verbs and arguments, but not so large that it would wash out that make use of strict Since the association ratio becomes unstable when the counts are very small, we will not discuss word with An improvement would make use of t-scores, and throw out pairs that were not significant. Unfortunately, this requires an estimate the variance of goes beyond the scope of this paper. For the remainder of this paper, we will adopt the simple but arbitrary threshold, and ignore pairs with small counts. the ratio different from information in respects. First, joint probabilities are supposed to be symmetric: P(y,x), thus, mutual information is symmetric: = 1(y ,x). the ratio is not symmetric, since linear precedence. (Recall that the number of times that word y in window of w words, not the number of times the two words appear in either order.) Although we could fix this problem by redefining be symmetric (by averaging the matrix with its transpose), we have decided not to do so, since order information appears to be very interesting. Notice the asymmetry in the pairs below (computed from 36 million words of 1988 AP text), illustrating a wide variety of biases ranging This definition a rectangular window.

This adjustment has the additional benefit assuring that = f(x) ,y) large, the association ratio produces very credible results not unlike those reported in [Palermo and Jenkins (1964)], as illustrated in the below. In contrast, when the pairs less interesting. (As a very rough rule of thumb, we observed that pairs with tend to be and pairs with smaller generally not. One can make this statement precise by calibrating the measure with subjective measures. Alternatively, one could make estimates of the variance and then make statements about confidence e.g., with 95% confidence, &gt; P(x) P(y).) Some Interesting Associations with &amp;quot;Doctor&amp;quot; In the 1987 AP Corpus (N = 15 million) y) f(x, y) f(x) x f(Y) 11.3 12 111 honorary 621 doctor 11.3 8 1105 doctors 44 dentists 10.7 30 1105 doctors 241 nurses 9.4 a 1105 doctors 154 treating 9.0 6 275 examined 621 doctor 8.9 11 1105 doctors 317 treat 8.7 25 621 doctor 1407 bills 8.7 6 621 doctor 350 visits 8.6 19 1105 doctors 676 hospitals 8.4 6 241 nurses 1105 doctors 0.96 6 621 doctor 73785 with 0.95 41 284690 a 1105 doctors 0.93 12 84716 is 1105 doctors ,y) we would predict that in complementary distribution. However, we are able to observe our corpora are too small (and our measurement techniques are too crude). Suppose, for example, both about 10 times per million of text. Then, P(y) and is Thus, to say that /(x,y) is much less than 0, we need to say that much less than a statement that is hard to make with much confidence given the size of presently available corpora. In fact, we cannot (easily) observe a probability less than and therefore, it is hard to know if much less than chance or not, unless is very large. (In fact, the pair doctors) above, appears significantly less often than chance. But to justify this statement, we need to compensate for the window size (which shifts the score by 2.0, e.g. from 0.96 down to — and we need to estimate the standard deviation, a method such as (1953)].) 5. Lexico-Syntactic Regularities Although the psycholinguistic literature documents the significance of noun/noun word associations such as doctor/nurse in considerable detail, relatively little is said about associations among verbs, function words, adjectives, and other non-nouns. In addition to identifying semantic relations of the doctor/nurse variety, we believe the association ratio can also be used to search for interesting lexico-syntactic relationships between verbs and typical arguments/adjuncts. The proposed association ratio can be viewed as a formalization of Sinclair&apos;s argument: common are the phrasal verbs with Set particularly rich in making combinations with words like in. up, out. on, off, these words are themselves common. How likely is off occur? Both are words; approximately 250 times in a words and) approximately 556 times in a million words... [The question we are asking can be rephrased as follows: how likely is occur after ... is 0.00025 x0.00055 P(y)], gives us the tiny figure of 0.0000001375 ... The assumption behind this calculation is that the words are distributed at random in a text [at chance, in our terminology). It is obvious to a linguist that this is not so, a rough measure of how much each other is to compare the probability with what actually 78 off nearly 70 times in the 7.3 million word corpus &gt;&gt; P(y)]. That is enough to show its main patterning and it suggests that in currently-held corpora there will be found sufficient evidence for the descliption of a substantial collection of phrases... [Sinclair (1987)e. pp. 151-152] happens that ... off found 177 times in the 1987 AP Corpus of approximately 15 million words, about the same number of occurrences per million as Sinclair found in his (mainly British) corpus. set ,o ff ) = indicating that probability of ... off is 64 times greater than chance. This association is relatively strong; the other particles that Sinclair mentions association ratios of: (1.4), up out (4.5), on (3.3)in 1987 AP Corpus. As Sinclair suggests, the approach is well suited for identifying phrasal verbs. However, phrasal verbs the preposition an interesting problem because of the possible confusion with the marker have found that if we first tag every word in the corpus with a part of speech using a method such as [Church (1988)], and then measure associations between tagged words, we can identify interesting contrasts between verbs with a following preposition verbs associated with a following infinitive marker of speech notation is borrowed from [Francis and Kucera (1982)]; in = preposition; to = marker; vb = bare verb; vbg = + ing; vbd = verb + ed; vbz = verb + s; vbn = verb + en.) The association ratio identifies quite a number of verbs associated in an interesting way our attention to pairs with a score of 3.0 or more, there are 768 verbs associated the preposition 551 verbs with the marker ten verbs found to be associated before are: to/in: adhere/vb, amounted/vbn, relating/vbg , amounting/vbg, revert/vb, verted/vbn, resorting/vbg, relegatecUvbn to/to: trying/vbg, compelled/vbn, enables/vbz, supposed/vbn, intends/vbz, vowing/vbg, tried/vbd, enabling/vbg, tends/vbz, tend/vb, intend/vb, tries/vbz Thus, we see there is considerable leverage to be gained by preprocessing the corpus and manipulating the inventory of tokens. For measuring syntactic constraints, it may be useful to include some part of speech information and to exclude much of the internal structure of noun phrases. For other purposes, it may be helpful to tag items and/or phrases with semantic labels such as *person*, *place*, *time*, *body-part*, *bad*, etc. Hindle (personal communication) has found it helpful to the input with parser [Hindle (1983a,b)] in order to identify associations between verbs and arguments, and postulate semantic classes for nouns on this basis. 6. Applications in Lexicography Large machine-readable corpora are only just now becoming available to lexicographers. Up to now, lexicographers have been reliant either on citations collected by human readers, which introduced an element of selectivity and so inevitably distortion (rare words and uses were collected but common uses of common words were not), or on small corpora of only a million words or so, which are reliably informative for only the most common uses of the few most frequent words of English. (A million-word corpus such as the Brown Corpus is reliable, roughly, for only some uses of only some of the forms of around 4000 dictionary entries. But standard dictionaries typically contain twenty times this number of entries.) The computational tools available for studying machine-readable corpora are at present still rather There are (see Figure 1 at the end of this paper), which are basically KWIC (key word in context [Aho, and Weinberger (1988), p. 122])indexes with additional features such as the ability to extend the context, sort leftwards as well as rightwards, and so on. There is very little interactive software. In a typical situation in the lexicography of the 1980s, a lexicographer is given the concordances for a word, marks up the printout with colored pens in order to identify the salient senses, and then writes syntactic descriptions and definitions. Although this technology is a great improvement on using human readers to collect boxes of citation index cards (the method Murray used in constructing the Oxford English Dictionary a century ago), it works well if there are no more than a few dozen concordance lines for a word, and only two or three main sense divisions. In analyzing a complex word such as &amp;quot;take&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;save&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;from&amp;quot;, the lexicographer is trying to pick out significant patterns and subtle distinctions that are buried in literally thousands of concordance lines: pages and pages of computer printout. The unaided human mind simply cannot discover all the significant patterns, let alone group them and rank in order of importance. The AP 1987 concordance to &amp;quot;save&amp;quot; is many pages 79 long; there are 666 lines for the base form alone, and many more for the inflected forms &amp;quot;saved,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;saves,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;saving,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;savings.&amp;quot; In the discussion that follows, we shall, for the sake of simplicity, not analyze the inflected forms and we shall only look at the patterns to the right of &amp;quot;save&amp;quot;. Words Often Co-Occurring to the right of &amp;quot;save&amp;quot; I(x, y) fix,y) f(x) x f(Y) 9.5 6 724 save &apos; 170 forests 9.4 6 724 save 180 $1.2 8.8 37 724 save 1697 lives 8.7 6 724 save 301 enormous 8.3 7 724 save 447 annually 7.7 20 724 save 2001 jobs 7.6 64 724 save 6776 money 7.2 36 724 save 4875 rife 6.6 8 724 save 1668 dollars 6.4 7 724 save 1719 costs 6.4 6 724 save 1481 thousands 6.2 9 724 save 2590 face 5.7 6 724 save 2311 SOD 5.7 6 724 save 2387 estimated 5.5 7 724 save 3141 your 5.5 24 724 save 10880 billion 5.3 39 724 save 20846 million 5.2 8 724 save 4398 US 5.1 6 724 save 3513 less 5.0 7 724 save 4590 OW11 4.6 7 724 save 5798 world 4.6 7 724 save 6028 my 4.6 15 724 save 13010 them 4.5 8 724 save 7434 country 4.4 15 724 save 14296 time 4.4 64 724 save 61262 from 4.3 23 724 save 23258 more 4.2 25 724 save 27367 their 4.1 8 724 save 9249 company 4.1 6 724 save 7114 month It is hard to know what is important in such a concordance and what is not. For example, although it is easy to see from the concordance selection in Figure 1 that the word &amp;quot;to&amp;quot; often comes before &amp;quot;save&amp;quot; and the word &amp;quot;the&amp;quot; often comes after &amp;quot;save,&amp;quot; it is hard to say from examination of a concordance alone whether either or both of these co-occurrences have any significance. Two examples will be illustrate how the association ratio measure helps make the analysis both quicker and more accurate. 6.1 Example 1: &amp;quot;save ... from&amp;quot; The association ratios (above) show that association norms apply to function words as well as content words. For example, one of the words significantly associated with &amp;quot;save&amp;quot; is &amp;quot;from&amp;quot;. Many dictionaries, for example Merriam-Webster&apos;s Ninth, make no explicit mention of &amp;quot;from&amp;quot; in the entry for &amp;quot;save&amp;quot;, although British learners&apos; dictionaries do make specific mention of &amp;quot;from&amp;quot; in connection with &amp;quot;save&amp;quot;. These learners&apos; dictionaries pay more attention to language structure and collocation than do American collegiate dictionaries, and lexicographers trained in the British tradition are often fairly skilled at spotting these generalizations. However, teasing out such facts, and distinguishing true intuitions from false intuitions takes a lot of time and hard work, and there is a high probability of inconsistencies and omissions. Which other verbs typically associate with &amp;quot;from,&amp;quot; and where does &amp;quot;save&amp;quot; rank in such a list? The association ratio identified 1530 words that are associated with &amp;quot;from&amp;quot;; 911 of them were tagged as verbs. The first 100 verbs are: refrain/vb, gIeaned/obn, stems/vbz, stemmed/vbd, stemming/vbs. ranging/ohs, stemmed/vbn, ranged/vbn, derived/vbn, ranged/vbd, extort/vb, graduated/vbd, barred/vba, benefiting/vbs, benefitted/vbn, benefited/vbn, exeused/vbd, arising/vbs, range/vb, exempts/vbz, suffers/vbz, exempting/vbg, benefited/vbd, prevented/vbd (7.0), seeping/vbs, barred/vbd, prevents/vbz, suffering/vbg, excluded/oho, marks/vbz, profiting/vbs, recovering/vbg, discharged/vbn, rebounding/vbs, vary/vb, exempted/vbn, separate/vb, banished/vbn, withdrawing/vbg, ferry/vb, prevented/vbn, profit/vb, bar/vb, excused/vbn, bars/vbx, benefit/vb, emerges/vbz, emerge/oh, varies/vbz, differ/vb, removed/vbn, exempt/vb, expelled/obit, withdraw/vb, stern/vb, separated/vbn, judging/vbg, adapted/vbn. escaping/vbg, inherited/vbn, differed/vbd, emerged/vbd, withheld/vbd, leaked/vbn, strip/vb, resulting/ohs, discourage/oh, prevent/vb, withdrew/vbd, prohibits/vbz, borrowing/vbg. Preventing/vbs, prohibk/vb, resulted/vbd (6.0), preclude/vb, divert/vb, distinguish/vb, pulled/vbn, felYvbn, varied/vbn, emerging/vbg, suffer/vb, prohibiting/vbg, extraet/vb, subtract/vb, recover/vb, paralyzed/vbn, stole/vbd. departing/vbg, esezped/vbn, prohibited/vbn, forbid/vb, evacuated/vbn, reap/vb, barring/ohs, removing/vbg, sto1en/vba, receives/vbz. &amp;quot;Save ... from&amp;quot; is a good example for illustrating advantages of the association ratio. ranked 319th in this list, indicating that the association is modest, strong enough to be important (21 times more likely than chance), but not so strong that it would pop out at us in a concordance, or that it would be one of the first things to come to mind. If the dictionary is going to list &amp;quot;save ... from,&amp;quot; for consistency&apos;s sake, it ought to consider listing all of the more important associations as well. Of the 27 bare verbs (tagged `vb, in the list above, all but 7 are listed in the Cobuild dictionary as occurring with &amp;quot;from&amp;quot;. However, this dictionary not note that ferry, strip, divert, forbid, with &amp;quot;from.&amp;quot; If the Cobuild lexicographers had had access to the proposed measure, they could possibly have obtained better coverage at less cost. 6.2 Example 2: Identifying Semantic Classes Having established the relative importance of &amp;quot;save ... from&amp;quot;, and having noted that the two words are rarely adjacent, we would now like to speed up the labor-intensive task of categorizing the concordance lines. Ideally, we would like to develop a set of semi-automatic tools that would help a lexicographer produce something like Figure 2, which provides an annotated summary of the 65 concordance lines for ... The &amp;quot;save ... from&amp;quot; pattern occurs in about 10% of the 666 concordance lines for &amp;quot;save.&amp;quot; Traditionally, semantic categories have been only vaguely recognized, and to date little effort has been devoted to a systematic classification of a large corpus. Lexicographers have tended to use concordances impressionistically; semantic theorist, AI-ers, and others have concentrated on a few interesting examples, e.g., &amp;quot;bachelor,&amp;quot; and have not given much thought to how the results might be scaled up. With this concern in mind, it seems reasonable to ask how well these 65 lines for &amp;quot;save ... from&amp;quot; fit in with all other uses of &amp;quot;save&amp;quot;? A laborious concordance analysis was undertaken to answer this question. When it was nearing completion, we noticed that the tags that we were inventing to capture the generalizations could in most cases have been suggested by looking at the lexical items listed in the association ratio table for &amp;quot;save&amp;quot;. For example, we had failed to notice the significance of time adverbials in our analysis of &amp;quot;save,&amp;quot; and no 2. The last unclassified line, &amp;quot;...save shoppers anywhere from SSD...&amp;quot; raises interesting problems. Syntactic &amp;quot;chunking&amp;quot; shows that, in spite of its co-occurrence of &amp;quot;from&amp;quot; with &amp;quot;save&amp;quot;, this line does not belong here. An intriguing exercise, given the lookup table we are trying to construct, is how to guard against false inferences such as that since &amp;quot;shoppers&amp;quot; is tagged (PERSON]. &amp;quot;$SO to $500&amp;quot; must here count an either BAD or a LOCATION. Accidental coincidences of this kind do not have a significant effect on the measure, however, although they do serve u a reminder of the probabilistic nature of the findings. dictionary records this. Yet it should be clear from the association ratio table above that &amp;quot;annually&amp;quot; and are commonly found with &amp;quot;save&amp;quot;. More detailed inspection shows that the time adverbials correlate interestingly with just one group of &amp;quot;save&amp;quot; objects, namely those tagged [MONEY]. The AP wire is full of discussions of &amp;quot;saving $1.2 billion per month&amp;quot;; computational lexicography should measure and record such patterns if they are general, even when traditional dictionaries do not. As another example illustrating how the association ratio tables would have helped us analyze the &amp;quot;save&amp;quot; concordance lines, we found ourselves contemplating the semantic tag ENV(IRONMENT) in order to analyze lines such as: the trend to save the forests[ENV] it&apos;s our turn to save the lake[ENV], joined a fight to save their forests[ENV], can we get busy to save the planet[ENV]? If we had looked at the association ratio tables before labeling the 65 lines for &amp;quot;save ... from,&amp;quot; we might have noticed the very large value for &amp;quot;save ... forests,&amp;quot; suggesting that there may be an important pattern here. In fact, this pattern probably subsumes most of the occurrences of the &amp;quot;save [ANIMAL)&amp;quot; pattern noticed in Figure 2. Thus, tables do not provide semantic tags, but they provide a powerful set of suggestions to the lexicographer for what needs to be accounted for in choosing a set of semantic tags. It may be that everything said here about &amp;quot;save&amp;quot; and other words is true only of 1987 American journalese. Intuitively, however, many of the patterns discovered seem to be good candidates for conventions of general English. A future step would be to examine other more balanced corpora and test how well the patterns hold up. 7. Conclusions We began this paper with the psycholinguistic notion • of word association norm, and extended that concept toward the information theoretic definition of mutual information. This provided a precise statistical calculation that could be applied to a very 3. The word &amp;quot;time&amp;quot; itself also occurs significantly in the table, but on closer examination it is clear that this use of &amp;quot;time&amp;quot; (e.g., &amp;quot;to save time&amp;quot;) counts as something like a commodity or resource, not as part of a time adjunct. Such are the pitfalls of lexicography (obvious when they are pointed out). 81 large corpus of text in order to produce a table of associations for tens of thousands of words. We were then able to show that the table encoded a number of very interesting patterns ranging from ... nurse to save ... from. finally concluded by showing how the patterns in the association ratio table might help a lexicographer organize a concordance. In point of fact, we actually developed these results in basically the reverse order. Concordance analysis is still extremely labor-intensive, and prone to errors of omission. The ways that concordances are sorted don&apos;t adequately support current lexicographic practice. Despite the fact that a concordance is indexed by a single word, often lexicographers actually use a second word such as &amp;quot;from&amp;quot; or an equally common semantic concept such as a time adverbial to decide how to categorize concordance lines. In other words, they use two words to on a word sense. This triangulation approach clusters concordance lines together into word senses based primarily on usage (distributional evidence), as opposed to intuitive notions of meaning. Thus, the question of what is a word sense can be addressed with syntactic methods (symbol pushing), and need not address semantics (interpretation), even though the inventory of tags may appear to have semantic values. The triangulation approach requires &amp;quot;art.&amp;quot; How does the lexicographer decide which potential cut points are &amp;quot;interesting&amp;quot; and which are merely due to chance? The proposed association ratio score provides a practical and objective measure which is often a fairly good approximation to the &amp;quot;art.&amp;quot; Since the proposed measure is objective, it can be applied in a systematic way over a large body of material, steadily improving consistency and productivity. But on the other hand, the objective score can be misleading. The score takes only distributional evidence into account. For example, the measure favors &amp;quot;set ... for&amp;quot; over &amp;quot;set ... down&amp;quot;; it doesn&apos;t know that the former is less interesting because its semantics are compositional. In addition, the measure is extremely superficial; it cannot cluster words into appropriate syntactic classes without an explicit preprocess such as Church&apos;s parts program &apos;or Hindle&apos;s parser. Neither of these preprocesses, though, can help highlight the &amp;quot;natural&amp;quot; similarity between nouns such as &amp;quot;picture&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;photograph.&amp;quot; Although one might imagine a preprocess that would help in this particular case, there will probably always be a class of generalizations that are obvious to an intelligent lexicographer, but lie hopelessly beyond the objectivity of a computer. Despite these problems, the association ratio could be an important tool to aid the lexicographer, rather like an index to the concordances. It can help us decide what to look for; it provides a quick summary of what company our words do keep.</abstract>

The proposed measure, the association ratio, estimates word association norms directly from computer readable corpora, making it possible to estimate norms for tens of thousands of words. 1. Meaning and Association It is common practice in linguistics to classify words not only on the basis of their meanings but also on the basis of their co-occurrence with other words.

However, phrasal verbs involving the preposition to raise an interesting problem because of the possible confusion with the infinitive marker to. We have found that if we first tag every word in the corpus with a part of speech using a method such as [Church (1988)], and then measure associations between tagged words, we can identify interesting contrasts between verbs associated with a following preposition to/in and verbs associated with a following infinitive marker to/to. (Part of speech notation is borrowed from [Francis and Kucera (1982)]; in = preposition; to = infinitive marker; vb = bare verb; vbg = verb + ing; vbd = verb + ed; vbz = verb + s; vbn = verb + en.) The association ratio identifies quite a number of verbs associated in an interesting way with to; restricting our attention to pairs with a score of 3.0 or more, there are 768 verbs associated with the preposition to/in and 551 verbs with the infinitive marker to/to. The ten verbs found to be most associated before to/in are: • to/in: alluding/vbg, adhere/vb, amounted/vbn, relating/vbg , amounting/vbg, revert/vb, reverted/vbn, resorting/vbg, relegatecUvbn • to/to: </context>

In fact, we cannot (easily) observe a probability less than 1/N 10-7, and therefore, it is hard to know if I(x,y) is much less than chance or not, unless chance is very large. (In fact, the pair (a, doctors) above, appears significantly less often than chance. But to justify this statement, we need to compensate for the window size (which shifts the score downward by 2.0, e.g. from 0.96 down to — 1.04) and we need to estimate the standard deviation, using a method such as [Good (1953)].) 5. Lexico-Syntactic Regularities Although the psycholinguistic literature documents the significance of noun/noun word associations such as doctor/nurse in considerable detail, relatively little is said about associations among verbs, function words, adjectives, and other non-nouns. In addition to identifying semantic relations of the doctor/nurse variety, we believe the association ratio can also be used to search for interesting lexico-syntactic relationships between verbs and typical arguments/adjuncts.

Both types of response to words (e.g., BUTTER) were consistently faster when preceded by associated words (e.g., BREAD) rather than unassociated words (e.g. NURSE).&amp;quot; (Meyer, Schvaneveldt and Ruddy (1975), p. 98) Much of this psycholinguistic research is based on empirical estimates of word association norms such as [Palermo and Jenkins (1964)], perhaps the most influential study of its kind, though extremely small and somewhat dated. This study measured 200 words by asking a few thousand subjects to write down a word after each of the 200 words to be measured. Results are reported in tabular form, indicating which words were written down, and by how many subjects, factored by grade level and sex. The word &amp;quot;doctor,&amp;quot; for example, is reported on pp. 98-100, to be most often associated with &amp;quot;nurse,&amp;quot; followed by &amp;quot;sick,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;health,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;medicine,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;hospital,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;man,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;sickness,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;lawyer,&amp;quot; and about 70 more words. 4.

This problem can be fixed by dividing f(x,y) by w — 1 (which has the consequence of subtracting log2(W — I) 2 from our association ratio scores). This adjustment has the additional benefit of assuring that f(x,y) = f(x) = f(y) = N. When 1(x ,y) is large, the association ratio produces very credible results not unlike those reported in [Palermo and Jenkins (1964)], as illustrated in the table below.

It is obvious to a linguist that this is not so, and a rough measure of how much set and off attract each other is to compare the probability with what actually 78 happens... Set off occurs nearly 70 times in the 7.3 million word corpus [P(x,y).0701(7.3 106) &gt;&gt; P(x) P(y)]. That is enough to show its main patterning and it suggests that in currently-held corpora there will be found sufficient evidence for the descliption of a substantial collection of phrases... [Sinclair (1987)e. pp. 151-152] It happens that set ... off was found 177 times in the 1987 AP Corpus of approximately 15 million words, about the same number of occurrences per million as Sinclair found in his (mainly British) corpus. Quantitatively, 1( set ,o ff ) = 5.9982, indicating that the probability of set ... off is almost 64 times greater than chance.
