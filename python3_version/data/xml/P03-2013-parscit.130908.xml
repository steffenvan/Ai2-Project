This paper describes our preliminary at-
tempt to automatically recognize zero ad-
nominals, a subgroup of zero pronouns, in
Japanese discourse. Based on the corpus
study, we define and classify what we call
“argument-taking nouns (ATNs),” i.e.,
nouns that can appear with zero adnomi-
nals. We propose an ATN recognition al-
gorithm that consists of lexicon-based
heuristics, drawn from the observations of
our analysis. We finally present the result
of the algorithm evaluation and discuss
future directions.

Therefore, even while eating grass, so that able
to see behind, eyes are placed at face-side.
This is a surface-level English translation of a
naturally occurring “unambiguous” Japanese dis-
course. By “unambiguous,” we mean that Japa-
nese speakers find no difficulty in interpreting this
discourse segment, including whose eyes are being
talked about. Moreover, Japanese speakers find
this segment quite “coherent,” even though there
seems to be no surface level indication of who is
eating or seeing, or whose eyes are being men-
tioned in this four-clause discourse segment. 1
However, this is not always the case with Japanese
as a Second Language (JSL) learners.2
What constitutes “coherence” has been studied
by many researchers. Reference is one of the lin-
guistic devices that create textual unity, i.e., cohe-

sion (Halliday and Hasan, 1976). Reference also
contributes to the semantic continuity and content
connectivity of a discourse, i.e., coherence. Co-
herence represents the natural and reasonable con-
nections between utterances that make for easy
understanding, and thus lower inferential load for
hearers.
The Japanese language uses ellipsis as its major
type of referential expression. Certain elements
are ellipted when they are recoverable from a given
context or from relevant knowledge. These ellip-
ses may include verbals and nominals; the missing
nominals have been termed “zero pronouns,” “zero
pronominals,” “zero arguments,” or simply “zeros”
by researchers.
How many zeros are contained in (1), for ex-
ample, largely depends on how zeros are defined.
In the literature, zeros are usually defined as ele-
ments recoverable from the valency requirements
of the predicate with which they occur. However,
does this cover all the zeros in Japanese? Does this
explain all the content connectivity created by
nominal ellipsis in Japanese?
In this paper, we introduce a subgroup of zeros,
what we call “zero adnominals,” in contrast to
other well-recognized “zero arguments” and inves-
tigate possible approaches to recognizing these
newly-defined zeros, in an attempt to incorporate
them in an automatic zero detecting tool for JSL
teachers that aims to promote effective instruction
of zeros. In section 2, we provide the definition of
zero adnominals, and present the results of their
manual identification in the corpus. Section 3 de-
scribes the theoretical and pedagogical motivations
for this study. Section 4 illustrates the syntac-
tic/semantic classification of the zero adnominal
examples found in the corpus. Based on the classi-
fication results, we propose lexical information-
based heuristics, and present a preliminary evalua-
tion. In the final two sections, we present related
work, and discuss possible future directions.

Zero arguments are unexpressed elements that are
predictable from the valency requirements of their
heads, i.e., a given predicate of the clause. Zero
nominatives in (2b) and (2c) are of this type. Zero
adnominals, analogously, are missing elements that
can be inferred from some features specified by
their head nouns. A noun for body-part, me ‘eyes’
in (2d) usually calls hearers’ attention to “of-
whom” information and hearers recover that in-
formation in the flow of discourse. That missing
information can be supplied by a noun phrase (NP)
followed by an adnominal particle no, i.e., si-
mauma-no ‘zebras’(= their)’ in the case of (2d)
above. Hence, as a first approximation, we define
a zero adnominal as an unexpressed “NP no” in the
NP no NP (a.k.a., A no B) construction.

2.3 Identification

Our primary goal is to identify relevant informa-
tion for recognizing zero adnominals. Since such
information is unavailable in the surface text, the
identification of missing adnominal elements and
their referents in the corpus was based on the na-
tive speaker intuitions and the linguistic expertise
of the author, who used the definition in 2.1, with
occasional consultation with a JSL teaching ex-
pert/linguist. As a result, we located a total of 320
zero adnominals. These adnominals serve as the
zero adnominal samples on which our later analy-
sis is based.

3 Theoretical/Pedagogical Motivations

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999799">
3.1 Centering Analysis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997386818181818">
One discourse account that models the perceived
degree of coherence of a given discourse in rela-
tion to local focus of attention and the choice of
referring expressions is centering (e.g., Grosz,
Joshi and Weinstein, 1995).
The investigation of zeros behavior in our cor-
pus, within the centering framework, shows that
zero adnominals make a considerable contribution
to center continuity in discourse by realizing the
central entity in an utterance (called Cb) just as
well-acknowledged zero arguments do.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.980717083333333">
Recall example (2). Its center data structure is
given in (3). The Cf (forward-looking center) list
is a set of discourse entities that appear in each
utterance (Ui). The Cb (backward-looking center)
is a special member of the Cf list, and is meant to
represent the entity that the utterance is most cen-
trally about; it is the most highly ranked element of
the Cf (Ui-1) that is realized in Ui.
(3) a. Cb: none [Cf: zebra, lion]
b. Cb: zebra [Cf: zebra, grass]
c. Cb: zebra [Cf: zebra, what is behind]
d. Cb: zebra [Cf: zebra, eye, face-side]
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999481117647059">
In (3b) and (3c), the Cb is realized as a zero nomi-
native, and in (3d), it is realized by the same entity
(zebra) as a zero adnominal, maintaining the
CONTINUE transition that by definition is maxi-
mally coherent. This matches the intuitively per-
ceived degree of coherence in the utterance. Our
corpus contains a total of 138 zero adnominals that
refer to previously mentioned entities (15.56% of
all the zero Cbs), and realize the Cb of the utter-
ance in which they occur, as in (3d=2d).
Our corpus study shows that discourse coher-
ence can be more accurately characterized, in the
centering account, by recognizing the role of zero
adnominals as a valid realization of Cbs (see Ya-
mura-Takei et al., ms. for detailed discussion).
This is our first motivation towards zero adnominal
recognition.

3.2 Zero Detector
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999995238095238">
Yamura-Takei et al. (2002) developed an auto-
matic zero identifying tool. This program, Zero
Detector (henceforth, ZD) takes Japanese written
narrative texts as input and provides the zero-
specified texts and their underlying structures as
output. This aims to draw learners’ and teachers’
attention to zeros, on the basis of a hypothesis
about ideal conditions for second language acquisi-
tion, by making invisible zeros visible. ZD regards
teachers as its primary users, and helps them pre-
dict the difficulties with zeros that students might
encounter, by analyzing text in advance. Such dif-
ficulties often involve failure to recognize dis-
course coherence created by invisible referential
devices, i.e., the center continuity maintained by
the use of various types of zeros.
As our centering analysis above indicates, in-
clusion of zero adnominals into ZD’s detecting
capability enables a more comprehensive coverage
of the zeros that contributes to discourse coherence.
This is our project goal.

Unexpressed elements need to be predicted from
other expressed elements. Thus, we need to char-
acterize B nouns (which are overt) in the (A no) B
construction, assuming that zero adnominals (A)
are triggered by their head nouns (B) and that cer-
tain types of NPs tend to take implicit (A) argu-
ments. Our first approach is to use an existing A
no B classification scheme. We adopted, from
among many A no B works, a classification mod-
eled on Shimazu, Naito and Nomura (1985, 1986,
and 1987) because it offers the most comprehen-
sive classification (Fais and Yamura-Takei, ms).

We conjecture that certain nouns are more
likely to take zero adnominals than others, and that
the head nouns which take zero adnominals, ex-
tracted from our corpus, are representative samples
of this particular group of nouns. We call them
“argument-taking nouns (ATNs).” ATNs syntacti-
cally require arguments and are semantically de-
pendent on their arguments. We use the term ATN
only to refer to a particular group of nouns that can
take implicit arguments (i.e., zero adnominals).
We closely examined the 127 different ATN
tokens among the 320 cases of zero adnominals
and classified them into the four types that corre-
spond to Groups I, II, III and V in Table 1. We
then listed their syntactic/semantic properties
based on the syntactic/semantic properties pre-
sented in the Goi-Taikei Japanese Lexicon (hereaf-
ter GT, Ikehara, Miyazaki, Shirai, Yokoo, Nakaiwa,
Ogura, Oyama, and Hayashi, 1997). GT is a se-
mantic feature dictionary that defines 300,000
nouns based on an ontological hierarchy of ap-
proximately 2,800 semantic attributes. It also uses
nine part-of-speech codes for nouns. Table 3 lists
the syntactic/semantic characterizations of the
nouns in each type and the number of examples in
the corpus. What bold means in the table will be
explained later in section 4.3.

When we examine these four types, we see that
they partially overlap with some particular types of
nouns studied theoretically in the literature. Tera-
mura (1991) subcategorizes locative relational
nouns like mae ‘front’, naka ‘inside’, and migi
‘right’ as “incomplete nouns” that require elements
to complete their meanings; these are a subset of
Type II. Iori (1997) argues that certain nouns are
categorized as “one-place nouns,” in which he
seems to include Type I and some of Type V nouns.
Kojima (1992) examines so-called “low-
independence nouns” and categorizes them into
three types, according to their syntactic behaviors
in Japanese copula expressions. These cover sub-
sets of our Type I, II, III and V. In computational
work, Bond, Ogura, and Ikehara (1995) extracted
205 “trigger nouns” from a corpus aligned with
English. These nouns trigger the use of possessive
pronouns when they are machine-translated into
English. They seem to correspond mostly to our
Type V nouns. Our result offers a comprehensive
coverage which subsumes all of the types of nouns
discussed in these accounts.
Next, let us more closely look at the properties
expressed by our samples. The most prevalent
ATNs (21 in number) are nominalized verbals in
the semantic category of human activity. The next
most common are kinship nouns (14 in number)
and body-part nouns (14), both in the common
noun category; location nouns (13), either in the
common noun or formal noun category; and nouns
that express amount (9) whose syntactic category
is either common or de-adjectival. The others in-
clude some “human” subcategories, etc.
The part-of-speech subcategory, “nominalized
verbal” (sahen-meishi) is a reasonably accurate
indicator of Type 1 nouns. So is “formal noun”
(keishiki-meishi) for Type II, although this does not
offer a full coverage of this type. Numeral noun
and counter suffix noun compounds also represent
a major subset of Type III.
Semantic properties, on the other hand, seem
helpful to extract certain groups such as location
(Type II), amount (Type III), kinship, body-part,
organization, and some human subcategories (Type
V). But other low-frequency ATN samples are
problematic for determining an appropriate level of
categorization in GT’s semantic hierarchy tree.

4.3 Algorithm
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998041863636363">
Our goal is to build a system that can identify the
presence of zero adnominals. In this section, we
propose an ATN (hence zero adnominal) recogni-
tion algorithm. The algorithm consists of a set of
lexicon-based heuristics, drawn from the observa-
tions in section 4.2.
The algorithm takes morphologically-analyzed
text as input and provides ATN candidates as out-
put. The process consists of the following three
phases: (i) bare noun extraction, (ii) syntactic cate-
gory (part-of-speech) checking, and (iii) semantic
category checking.
Zero adnominals usually co-occur with “bare
nouns.” Bare nouns, in our definition, are nouns
without any pre-nominal modifiers, including de-
monstratives, explicit adnominal phrases, relative
clauses, and adjectives.3 Bare nouns are often sim-
plex as in (4a), and sometimes are compound (e.g.,
numeral noun + counter suffix noun) as in (4b).
These are immediately followed by case-marking,
topic/focus-marking or other particles (e.g., ga, o,
ni, wa, mo).

b. 70-paasento-o 70-percent-ACC
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999775916666667">
The extracted nouns under this definition are initial
candidates for ATNs.
Once bare nouns are identified, they are
checked against our syntactic-property- (i.e., part-
of-speech, POS) based-, followed by semantic-
attribute (SEM) based-heuristics. For semantic
filtering, we decided to use the noun groups of
high frequency (more than two tokens categorized
in the same group; indicated in bold in Table 3
above) to minimize a risk of over-generalization.
The algorithm checks the following two condi-
tions, for each bare noun, in this order:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.901999285714286">
[1] If POS = [nominalized verval, derived noun,

Therefore, nouns that pass condition [1] are labeled
as ATNs, without checking their semantic proper-
ties. A noun that fails to pass condition [1] and
passes condition [2] is labeled as ATN. A noun
that fails to match both [1] and [2] is labeled as
non-ATN. Consider the noun sintyo ‘height’ for
example. Its POS code in GT is common noun, so
it fails condition [1] and goes to [2]. This noun is
categorized in the “2591: measures” group which
is under the “2585: amount” node in the hierarchy
tree, so it is labeled as ATN. In this way, the algo-
rithm labels each bare noun as either ATN or non-
ATN.

examination of those errors indicates that most of
them (8 out of 9 cases) involve verbal idiomatic

We take a zero adnominal approach, as in (6c),
because we assume, for our pedagogical purpose
discussed in section 3.2, that zero adnominals, by
making them visible, more effectively prompt peo-
ple to notice referential links than lexical relations,
such as meronymy in (6a) and (6b).
However, insights from other approaches are
worth attention. There is a strong resemblance
between bare nouns (that zero adnominals co-occur
with) in Japanese and definite descriptions in Eng-
lish in their behaviors, especially in their referen-
tial properties (Sakahara, 2000). The task of
classifying several different uses of definite de-
scriptions (Vieira and Poesio, 2000; Bean and
Riloff, 1999) is somewhat analogous to that for
bare nouns. Determining definiteness of Japanese
noun phrases (Heine, 1998; Bond et al., 1995; Mu-
rata and Nagao, 1993)8 is also relevant to ATN
(which is definite in nature) recognition.

We have proposed an ATN (hence zero adnomi-
nal) recognition algorithm, with lexicon-based heu-
ristics that were inferred from our corpus
investigation. The evaluation result shows that the
syntactic/semantic feature-based generalization
(using GT) is capable of identifying potential
ATNs. The evaluation on a larger corpus, of
course, is essential to verify this claim. Implemen-
tation of the algorithm is also in our future agenda.
This approach has its limitations, too, as is
pointed out by Kurohashi et al. (1999). One limi-
tation is illustrated by a pair of Japanese nouns,
sakusya ‘author’ and sakka ‘writer,’ which fall un-
der the same GT semantic property group (at the
deepest level).9 These nouns have an intuitively
different status for their valency requirements; the
former requires “of-what work” information, while
the latter does not. 10 We risk over- or under-
generation when we designate certain semantic
properties, no matter how fine-grained they might

8 Their interests are in machine-translation of Japanese into
languages that require determiners for their nouns.

seven native speakers of Japanese.

be. We proposed the idiom-filtering rule to solve
one case of over-detection. A larger-scale evalua-
tion of the algorithm and its error analysis might
lead to additional rules that refine extracted ATN
candidates. Insights from the works presented in
the previous section could also be incorporated.
Determining an appropriate level of generaliza-
tion is a significant factor for this type of approach,
and this was done, in this study, according to our
introspective judgments. More systematic methods
should be explored.
A related issue is the notoriously hard-to-define
argument-adjunct distinction for nouns, which is
closely related to the distinction between ATNs
and non-ATNs. We experimentally tested seven
native-Japanese-speaking subjects in distinguish-
ing these two. We presented 26 nouns in the same
GT semantic category (at the deepest level): “per-
sons who write.” There were six nouns which all
the subjects agreed on categorizing as ATNs, in-
cluding sakusha ‘author.’ Five nouns, including
sakka ‘writer,’ on the other hand, were judged as
non-ATNs by all the subjects. For the remaining
15 nouns, however, their judgments varied widely.
As Somers (1984) suggests for verbs, binary dis-
tinction does not work well for nouns, either. This
distinction might largely depend on the context in
some cases. This is also something we will need to
address.
In this study, we focused on “implicit argu-
ment-taking nouns.” There may be a line (al-
though it may be very thin) between nouns which
take explicit arguments and those which take im-
plicit arguments. This distinction also needs fur-
ther investigation in the corpus.

Based on the corpus study, we define and classify what we call “argument-taking nouns (ATNs),” i.e., nouns that can appear with zero adnominals. We propose an ATN recognition algorithm that consists of lexicon-based heuristics, drawn from the observations of our analysis. We finally present the result of the algorithm evaluation and discuss future directions.</abstract>

Coherence represents the natural and reasonable connections between utterances that make for easy understanding, and thus lower inferential load for hearers. The Japanese language uses ellipsis as its major type of referential expression. Certain elements are ellipted when they are recoverable from a given context or from relevant knowledge.

However, insights from other approaches are worth attention. There is a strong resemblance between bare nouns (that zero adnominals co-occur with) in Japanese and definite descriptions in English in their behaviors, especially in their referential properties (Sakahara, 2000). The task of classifying several different uses of definite descriptions (Vieira and Poesio, 2000; Bean and Riloff, 1999) is somewhat analogous to that for bare nouns. Determining definiteness of Japanese noun phrases (Heine, 1998; Bond et al., 1995; Murata and Nagao, 1993)8 is also relevant to ATN (which is definite in nature) recognition. 6 Future Directions We have proposed an ATN (hence zero adnominal) recognition algorithm, with lexicon-based heuristics that were inferred from our corpus investigation. The evaluation result shows that the syntactic/semantic feature-based generalization (</context>

The number and percentage of examples of each group are presented in Table 2.

We experimentally tested seven native-Japanese-speaking subjects in distinguishing these two. We presented 26 nouns in the same GT semantic category (at the deepest level): “persons who write.” There were six nouns which all the subjects agreed on categorizing as ATNs, including sakusha ‘author.’ Five nouns, including sakka ‘writer,’ on the other hand, were judged as non-ATNs by all the subjects. For the remaining 15 nouns, however, their judgments varied widely. As Somers (1984) suggests for verbs, binary distinction does not work well for nouns, either. This distinction might largely depend on the context in some cases. This is also something we will need to address. In this study, we focused on “implicit argument-taking nouns.” There may be a line (although it may be very thin) between nouns which take explicit arguments and those which take implicit arguments. This distinction also needs further investigation in the corpus.

Our corpus contains a total of 138 zero adnominals that refer to previously mentioned entities (15.56% of all the zero Cbs), and realize the Cb of the utterance in which they occur, as in (3d=2d). Our corpus study shows that discourse coherence can be more accurately characterized, in the centering account, by recognizing the role of zero adnominals as a valid realization of Cbs (see Yamura-Takei et al., ms. for detailed discussion). This is our first motivation towards zero adnominal recognition. 3.2 Zero Detector Yamura-Takei et al. (2002) developed an automatic zero identifying tool. This program, Zero Detector (henceforth, ZD) takes Japanese written narrative texts as input and provides the zerospecified texts and their underlying structures as output. This aims to draw learners’ and teachers’ attention to zeros, on the basis of a hypothesis about ideal conditions for second language acquisition, by making invisible zeros visible. ZD regards teachers as its primary users, and helps them predict the difficulties with zeros that students might encounter, by analyzing text in advance. Such difficulties often involve failure to r</context>
