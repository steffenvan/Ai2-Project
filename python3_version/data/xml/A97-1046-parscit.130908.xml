Information Retrieval (IR) is an important
application area of Natural Language Pro-
cessing (NLP) where one encounters the
genuine challenge of processing large quan-
tities of unrestricted natural language text.
While much effort has been made to apply
NLP techniques to IR, very few NLP tech-
niques have been evaluated on a document
collection larger than several megabytes.
Many NLP techniques are simply not ef-
ficient enough, and not robust enough, to
handle a large amount of text. This pa-
per proposes a new probabilistic model for
noun phrase parsing, and reports on the
application of such a parsing technique to
enhance document indexing. The effective-
ness of using syntactic phrases provided by
the parser to supplement single words for
indexing is evaluated with a 250 megabytes
document collection. The experiment&apos;s re-
sults show that supplementing single words
with syntactic phrases for indexing consis-
tently and significantly improves retrieval
performance.

<bodyText confidence="0.999713807017544">
Information Retrieval (IR) is an increasingly impor-
tant application area of Natural Language Process-
ing (NLP). An IR task can be described as to find,
from a given document collection, a subset of docu-
ments whose content is relevant to the information
need of a user as expressed by a query. As the doc-
uments and query are often natural language texts,
an IR task can usually be regarded as a special NLP
task, where the document text and the query text
need to be processed in order to judge the relevancy.
A general strategy followed by most IR systems is
to transform documents and the query into certain
level of representation. A query representation can
then be compared with a document representation
to decide if the document is relevant to the query. In
practice, the level of representation in an IR system
is quite &amp;quot;shallow&amp;quot; — often merely a set of word-like
strings, or indexing terms. The process to extract in-
dexing terms from each document in the collection
is called indexing. A query is often subject to simi-
lar processing, and the relevancy is judged based on
the matching of query terms and document terms.
In most systems, weights are assigned to terms to
indicate how well they can be used to discriminate
relevant documents from irrelevant ones.
The challenge in applying NLP to IR is to deal
with a large amount of unrestricted natural lan-
guage text. The NLP techniques used must be very
efficient and robust, since the amount of text in
the databases accessed is typically measured in gi-
gabytes. In the past, NLP techniques of different
levels, including morphological, syntactic/semantic,
and discourse processing, were exploited to enhance
retrieval (Smeaton 92; Lewis and Sparck Jones 96),
but were rarely evaluated using collections of docu-
ments larger than several megabytes. Many NLP
techniques are simply not efficient enough or are
too labor-intensive to successfully handle a large size
document set. However, there are some exceptions.
Evans et al. used selective NLP techniques, that are
especially robust and efficient, for indexing (Evans
et al. 91). Strzalkowski reported a fast and robust
parser called TTP in (Strzalkowski 92; Strzalkowski
and Vauthey 92). These NLP techniques have been
successfully used to process quite large collections,
as shown in a series of TREC conference reports by
the CLARITTA&amp;quot; system group and the New York
University (later GE/NYU) group (cf., for example,
(Evans and Lefferts 95; Evans et al. 96), and (Strza-
lkowski 95; Strzalkowski et al. 96)) These research
efforts demonstrated the feasibility of using selec-
tive NLP to handle large collections. A special NLP
track emphasizing the evaluation of NLP techniques
for IR is currently held in the context of TREC (Har-
man 96).
In this paper, a fast probabilistic noun phrase
parser is described. The parser can be exploited to

automatically extract syntactic phrases from a large
amount of documents for indexing. A 250-megabyte
document set2 is used to evaluate the effectiveness of
indexing using the phrases extracted by the parser.
The experiment&apos;s results show that using syntactic
phrases to supplement single words for indexing im-
proves the retrieval performance significantly. This
is quite encouraging compared to earlier experiments
on phrase indexing. The noun phrase parser pro-
vides the possibility of combining different kinds of
phrases with single words.

2 Phrases for Document Indexing
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.990189323529412">
In most current IR systems, documents are primarily
indexed by single words, sometimes supplemented by
phrases obtained with statistical approaches, such as
frequency counting of adjacent word pairs. However,
single words are often ambiguous and not specific
enough for accurate discrimination of documents.
For example, only using the word &amp;quot;bank&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;ter-
minology&amp;quot; for indexing is not enough to distinguish
&amp;quot;bank terminology&amp;quot; from &amp;quot;terminology bank&amp;quot;. More
specific indexing units are needed. Syntactic phrases
(i.e., phrases with certain syntactic relations) are al-
most always more specific than single words and thus
are intuitively attractive for indexing. For example,
if &amp;quot;bank terminology&amp;quot; occurs in the document, then,
we can use the phrase &amp;quot;bank terminology&amp;quot; as an ad-
ditional unit to supplement the single words &amp;quot;bank&amp;quot;
and &amp;quot;terminology&amp;quot; for indexing. In this way, a query
with &amp;quot;terminology bank&amp;quot; will match better with the
document than one with &amp;quot;bank terminology&amp;quot;, since
the indexing phrase &amp;quot;bank terminology&amp;quot; provides ex-
tra discrimination.
Despite the intuitive rationality of using phrases
for indexing, syntactic phrases have been reported
to show no significant improvement of retrieval per-
formance (Lewis 91; Belkin and Croft 87; Fagan
87). Moreover Fagan (Fagan 87) found that syn-
tactic phrases are not superior to simple statistical
phrases. Lewis discussed why the syntactic phrase
indexing has not worked and concluded that the
problems with syntactic phrases are for the most
part statistical (Lewis 91). Indeed, many (perhaps
most) syntactic phrases have very low frequency and
tend to be over-weighted by the normal weighting
method. However, the size of the collection used in

these early experiments is relatively small. We want
to see if a much larger size of collection will make a
difference. It is possible that a larger document col-
lection might increase the frequency of most phrases,
and thus alleviate the problem of low frequency.
We only consider noun phrases and the sub-
phrases derived from them. Specifically, we want to
obtain the full modification structure of each noun
phrase in the documents and query. From the view-
point of NLP, the task is noun phrase parsing (i.e.,
the analysis of noun phrase structure). When the
phrases are used only to supplement, not replace,
the single words for indexing, some parsing errors
may be tolerable. This means that the penalty for
a parsing error may not be significant. The chal-
lenge, however, is to be able to parse gigabytes of
text in practically feasible time and as accurately
as possible. The previous work taking on this chal-
lenge includes (Evans et al. 91; Evans et al. 96;
Evans and Zhai 96; Strzalkowski and Carballo 94;
Strzalkowski et al. 95) among others. Evans et
al. exploited the &amp;quot;attestedness&amp;quot; of subphrases to
partially reveal the structure of long noun phrases
(Evans et al. 91; Evans et al. 96). Strzalkowski et
al. adopted a fast Tagged Text Parser (TTP) to ex-
tract head modifier pairs including those in a noun
phrase (Strzalkowski 92; Strzalkowski and Vauthey
92; Strzalkowski and Carballo 94; Strzalkowski et
al. 95). In (Strzalkowski et al. 95), the structure
of a noun phrase is disambiguated based on certain
statistical heuristics, but there seems to be no ef-
fort to assign a full structure to every noun phrase.
Furthermore, manual effort is needed in constructing
grammar rules. Thus, the approach in (Strzalkowski
et al. 95) does not address the special need of scal-
ability and robustness along with speed. Evans and
Zhai explored a hybrid noun phrase analysis method
and used a quite rich set of phrases for document in-
dexing (Evans and Zhai 96). The indexing method
was evaluated using the Associated Press newswire
89 (AP89) database in Tipster Disk 1, and a general
improvement of retrieval performance over the in-
dexing with single words and full noun phrases was
reported. However, the phrase extraction system
as reported in (Evans and Zhai 96) is still not fast
enough to deal with document collections measured
by gigabytes.&apos;
We propose here a probabilistic model of noun
phrase parsing. A fast statistical noun phrase parser
has been developed based on the probabilistic model.
The parser works fast and can be scaled up to parse
gigabytes text within acceptable time.&apos; Our goal
is to generate different kinds of candidate syntactic

3 Fast Noun Phrase Parsing
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999091186046512">
A fast and robust noun phrase parser is a key to
the exploration of syntactic phrase indexing. Noun
phrase parsing, or noun phrase structure analy-
sis ( also known as compound noun analysis5),
is itself an important research issue in computa-
tional linguistics and natural language processing.
Long noun phrases, especially long compound nouns
such as &amp;quot;information retrieval technique&amp;quot;, generally
have ambiguous structures. For instance, &amp;quot;informa-
tion retrieval technique&amp;quot; has two possible structures:
&amp;quot;[[information retrieval] techniquer and &amp;quot;[informa-
tion [retrieval technique]/&apos;. A principal difficulty
in noun phrase structure analysis is to resolve such
structural ambiguity. When a large corpus is avail-
able, which is true for an IR task, statistical prefer-
ence of word combination or word modification can
be a good clue for such disambiguation. As summa-
rized in (Lauer 95), there are two different models
for corpus-based parsing of noun phrases: the adja-
cency model and the dependency model. The differ-
ence between the two models can be illustrated by
the example compound noun &amp;quot;informationeretrieval
technique&amp;quot;. In the adjacency model, the structure
would be decided by looking at the adjacency as-
sociation of &amp;quot;information retrieval&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;retrieval
technique&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;information retrieval&apos; will be grouped
first, if &amp;quot;information retrieval&apos; has a stronger as-
sociation than &amp;quot;retrieval technique&amp;quot;, otherwise, &amp;quot;re-
trieval technique&amp;quot; will be grouped first. In the de-
pendency model, however, the structure would be
decided by looking at the dependency between &amp;quot;in-
formation&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;retrieval&apos; (i.e., the tendency for
&amp;quot;information&amp;quot; to modify &amp;quot;retrieval&apos;) and the depen-
dency between &amp;quot;information&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;technique&amp;quot;. If
&amp;quot;information&amp;quot; has a stronger dependency associa-
tion with &amp;quot;retrieval&amp;quot; than with &amp;quot;technique&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;infor-
mation retrieval&apos; will be grouped first, otherwise,
&amp;quot;retrieval technique&amp;quot; will be grouped first. The ad-
jacency model dates at least from (Marcus 80) and
has been explored recently in (Liberman and Sproat
92; Pustejovsky et al. 93; Resnik and Hearst 93;
Lauer 95; Strzalkowski et al. 95; Evans and Zhai
96); The dependency model has mainly been stud-
ied in (Lauer 94). Evans and Zhai (Evans and Zhai
96) use primarily the adjacency model, but the as-
sociation score also takes into account some degree
of dependency. Lauer (Lauer 95) compared the ad-
jacency model and the dependency model for com-
pound noun disambiguation, and concluded that the
&apos;Strictly speaking, however, compound noun analysis
is a special case of noun phrase analysis, but the same
technique can often be used for both.
dependency model provides a substantial advantage
over the adjacency model.
We now propose a probabilistic model in which the
dependency structure, or the modification structure,
of a noun phrase is treated as &amp;quot;hidden&amp;quot;, similar to
the tree structure in the probabilistic context-free
grammar (Jelinek et al. 90). The basic idea is as
follows.
A noun phrase can be assumed to be generated
from a word modification structure (i.e., a depen-
dency structure). Since noun phrases with more
than two words are structurally ambiguous, if we
only observe the noun phrase, then the actual struc-
ture that generates the noun phrase is &amp;quot;hidden&amp;quot;. We
treat the noun phrases with their possible structures
as the complete data and the noun phrases occur-
ring in the corpus (without the structures) as the
observed incomplete data. In the training phase, an
Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm (Demp-
ster et al. 77) can be used to estimate the parame-
ters of word modification probabilities by iteratively
maximizing the conditional expectation of the likeli-
hood of the complete data given the observed incom-
plete data and a previous estimate of the parameters.
In the parsing phase, a noun phrase is assigned the
structure that has the maximum conditional proba-
bility given the noun phrase.
Formally, assume that each noun phrase is gener-
ated using a word modification structure. For exam-
ple, &amp;quot;information retrieval technique&amp;quot; may be gener-
ated using either the structure &amp;quot;[X1[X2X3]]&amp;quot; or the
structure &amp;quot;[[X1X2]X3]&amp;quot;. The log likelihood of gen-
erating a noun phrase, given the set of noun phrases
observed in a corpus NP = { ripi} can be written as:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9423325">
L(0) E c(npi)log E po(npi, Sj)

<bodyText confidence="0.998487916666667">
where, S is the set of all the possible modification
structures; c(npi) is the count of the noun phrase npi
in the corpus; and Pit,(npi, sj) gives the probability of
deriving the noun phrase npi using the modification
structure si.
With the simplification that generating a noun
phrase from a modification structure is the same as
generating all the corresponding word modification
pairs in the noun phrase and with the assumption
that each word modification pair in the noun phrase
is generated independently, P4,(npi, sj) can further
be written as

P4,(npi, sj) = Po(u,

modification pairs (u, v) being generated when npi
is derived from si. P(s3) is the probability of struc-
ture si ; while Po(u, v) is the probability of generat-
ing the word pair (u, v) given any word modifica-
tion relation. P4,(si) and Po(u, v) are subject to the
constraint of summing up to 1 over all modification
structures and over all possible word combinations
respectively.&apos;
The model is clearly a special case of the class of
the algebraic language models, in which the proba-
bilities are expressed as polynomials in the param-
eters(Lafferty 95). For such models, the M-step in
the EM algorithm can be carried out exactly, and

<bodyText confidence="0.999383625">
70ne problem with such simplification is that the
model may generate a set of word modification pairs that
do not form a noun phrase, although such &amp;quot;illegal noun
phrases&amp;quot; are never observed. A better model would be
to write the probability of each word modification pair
as the conditional probability of the modifier (i.e., the
modifying word) given the head (i.e., the word being
modified). That is,

<equation confidence="0.962799">

<bodyText confidence="0.999543047619048">
where h(np,) is the head (i.e., the last word) of the noun
phrase np, (Lafferty 96).
The EM algorithm ensures that L(n +1) is greater
than L(n). In other words, every step of parameter
update increases the likelihood. Thus, at the time of
training, the parser can first randomly initialize the
parameters, and then, iteratively update the param-
eters according to the update formulas until the in-
crease of the likelihood is smaller than some pre-set
threshold.8 In the implementation described here,
the maximum length of any noun phrase is limited
to six. In practice, this is not a very tight limit, since
simple noun phrases with more than six words are
quite rare Summing over all the possible structures
for any noun phrase is computed by enumerating all
the possible structures with an equal length as the
noun phrase. For example, in the case of a three-
word noun phrase, only two structures need to be
enumerated.
At the time of parsing noun phrases, the structure
of any noun phrase np (S(np)) is determined by
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9979165">
S (np) = argmas P(sinp)

argmax, H P(u, v)P(s)
(u,v)EM(np,$)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999711413793103">
We found that the parameters may easily be bi-
ased owing to data sparseness. For example, the
modification structure parameters naturally prefer
left association to right association in the case of
three-word noun phrases, when the data is sparse.
Such bias in the parameters of the modification
structure probability will be propagated to the word
modification parameters when the parameters are
iteratively updated using EM algorithm. In the ex-
periments reported in this paper, an over-simplified
solution is adopted. We simply fixed the modifica-
tion structure parameter and assumed every depen-
dency structure is equally likely.
Fast training is achieved by reading all the noun
phrase instances into memory.9 This forces us to
split the whole noun phrase corpus into small chunks
for training. In the experiments reported in this
paper, we split the corpus into chunks of a size of
around 4 megabytes. Each chunk has about 170,000
(or about 100,000 unique) raw multiple word noun
phrases. The parameters estimated on each sub-
corpus are then merged (averaged). We do not know
how much the merging of parameters affects the pa-
rameter estimation, but it seems that a majority of
phrases are correctly parsed with the merged param-
eter estimation, based on a rough check of the pars-
ing results. With this approach, it takes a 133-MHz
DEC Alpha workstation about 5 hours to train the
parser over the noun phrases from a 250-megabyte
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.9937394">

threshold is 2.
9An alternative way would be to keep the corpus in
the disk. In this way, it is not necessary to split the
corpus, unless it is extremely large.

text corpus. Parsing is much faster, taking less than ( Original Document Set
1 hour to parse all noun phrases in the corpus of i
a 250-megabyte text. The parsing speed can be
scaled up to gigabytes of text, even when the parser
needs to be re-trained over the noun phrases in the
whole corpus. However, the speed has not taken into
account the time required for extracting the noun
phrases for training. In the experiments described
in the following section, the CLARIT noun phrase
extractor is used to extract all the noun phrases from
the 250-megabyte text corpus.
After the training on each chunk, the estimation
of the parameter of word modifications is smoothed
to account for the unseen word modification pairs.
Smoothing is made by &amp;quot;dropping&amp;quot; a certain number
of parameters that have the least probabilities, tak-
ing out the probabilities of the dropped parameters,
and evenly distributing these probabilities among
all the unseen word pairs as well as those pairs of
the dropped parameters. It is unnecessary to keep
the dropped parameters after smoothing, thus this
method of smoothing helps reduce the memory over-
load when merging parameters. In the experiments
reported in the paper, nearly half of the total num-
ber of word pairs seen in the training chunk were
dropped. Since, word pairs with the least probabil-
ities generally occur quite rarely in the corpus and
usually represent semantically illegal word combina-
tions, dropping such word pairs does not affect the
parsing output so significantly as it seems. In fact, it
may not affect the parsing decisions for the majority
of noun phrases in the corpus at all.
The potential parameter space for the probabilis-
tic model can be extremely large, when the size of
the training corpus is getting larger. One solution
to this problem is to use a class-based model similar
to the one proposed in (Brown et al. 92) or use pa-
rameters of conceptual association rather than word
association, as discussed in (Lauer 94)(Lauer 95).
4 Experiment Design
We used the CLARIT commercial retrieval system
as a retrieval engine to test the effectiveness of differ-
ent indexing sets. The CLARIT system uses the vec-
tor space retrieval model(Salton and McGill 83), in
which documents and the query are all represented
by a vector of weighted terms (either single words or
phrases), and the relevancy judgment is based on the
similarity (measured by the cosine measure) between
the query vector and any document vector(Evans et
al. 93; Evans and Lefferts 95; Evans et al. 96). The
experiment procedure is described by Figure 1.
First, the original database is parsed to form dif-
ferent sets of indexing terms (say, using different
combination of phrases). Then, each indexing set is
passed to the CLARIT retrieval engine as a source
document set. The CLARIT system is configured to
accept the indexing set we passed as is to ensure that

the actual indexing terms used inside the CLARIT
system are exactly those generated.
It is possible to generate three different
kinds/levels of indexing units from a noun phrase:
(1) single words; (2) head modifier pairs (i.e., any
word pair in the noun phrase that has a linguis-
tic modification relation); and (3) the full noun
phrase. For example, from the phrase structure
&amp;quot;Mheavy=constructioni=industry}]=groupr (a real
example from WSJ90), it is possible to generate the
following candidate terms:
SINGLE WORDs:
heavy, construction, industry, group
HEAD MODIFIERS:
construction industry, industry group,
heavy construction
FULL NP:
heavy construction industry group
Different combinations of the three kinds of terms
can be selected for indexing. In particular, the in-
dexing set formed solely of single words is used as a
baseline to test the effect of using phrases. In the ex-
periments reported here, we generated four different
combinations of phrases:
- WD-SET:
single word only (no phrases, baseline)
- WD-HM-SET:
316
single word + head modifier pair
- WD—NP—SET:
single word + full NP
- WD—HM—NP—SET:

We used, as our document set, the Wall Street Jour-
nal database in Tipster Disk2 (Harman 96) the size
of which is about 250 megabytes. We performed
the experiments by using the TREC-5 ad hoc topics
(i.e., TREC topics 251-300). Each run involves an
automatic feedback with the top 10 documents re-
turned from the initial retrieval. The CLARIT au-
tomatic feedback is performed by adding terms from
a query-specific thesaurus extracted from the top N
documents returned from the initial retrieval(Evans
and Lefferts 95). The results are evaluated using
the standard measures of recall and precision. Re-
call measures how many of the relevant documents
have actually been retrieved. Precision measures
how many of the retrieved documents are indeed rel-
evant. They are calculated by the following simple
formulas:

We used the standard TREC evaluation package
provided by Cornell University and used the judged-
relevant documents from the TREC evaluations as
the gold standard(Harman 94).
In Table 1, we give a summary of the results and
compare the three phrase combination runs with the
corresponding baseline run. In the table, &amp;quot;Ret-rel&amp;quot;
means &amp;quot;retrieved-relevant&amp;quot; and refers to the total
number of relevant documents retrieved. &amp;quot;mit Prec&amp;quot;
means &amp;quot;initial precision&amp;quot; and refers to the highest
level of precision over all the points of recall. &amp;quot;Avg
Prec&amp;quot; means &amp;quot;average precision&amp;quot; and is the average
of all the precision values computed after each new
relevant document is retrieved.
It is clear that phrases help both recall and pre-
cision when supplementing single words, as can be
seen from the improvement of all phrase runs (WD-
HM-SET, WD-NP-SET, WD-HM-NP-SET) over
the single word run WD-SET.
It can also be seen that when only one kind of
phrase (either the full NPs or the head modifiers) is
used to supplement the single words, each can lead
to a great improvement in precision. However, when
we combine the two kinds of phrases, the effect is a
greater improvement in recall rather than precision.
The fact that each kind of phrase can improve pre-
cision significantly when used separately shows that

these phrases are indeed very useful for indexing.
The combination of phrases results in only a smaller
precision improvement but causes a much greater
increase in recall. This may indicate that more ex-
periments are needed to understand how to combine
and weight different phrases effectively.
The same parsing method has also been used
to generate phrases from the same data for the
CLARIT NLP track experiments in TREC-5(Zhai
et al. 97), and similar results were obtained, al-
though the WD-NP-SET was not tested. The results
in (Zhai et al. 97) are not identical to the results
here, because they are based on two separate train-
ing processes. It is possible that different training
processes may result in slightly different parameter
estimations, because the corpus is arbitrarily seg-
mented into chunks of only roughly 4 megabytes for
training, and the chunks actually used in different
training processes may vary slightly.

6 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.984135307692308">
Information retrieval provides a good way to quanti-
tatively (although indirectly) evaluate various NLP
techniques. We explored the application of a fast
statistical noun phrase parser to enhance document
indexing in information retrieval. We proposed a
new probabilistic model for noun phrase parsing and
developed a fast noun phrase parser that can han-
dle relatively large amounts of text efficiently. The
effectiveness of enhancing document indexing with
the syntactic phrases provided by the noun phrase
parser was evaluated on the Wall Street Journal
database in Tipster Disk2 using 50 TREC-5 ad hoc
topics. Experiment results on this 250-megabyte
document collection have shown that using differ-
ent kinds of syntactic phrases provided by the noun
phrase parser to supplement single words for index-
ing can significantly improve the retrieval perfor-
mance, which is more encouraging than many early
experiments on syntactic phrase indexing. Thus, us-
ing selective NLP, such as the noun phrase parsing
technique we proposed, is not only feasible for use in
information retrieval, but also effective in enhancing
the retrieval performance.1°
10Whether such syntactic phrases are more effective
than simple statistical phrases (e.g., high frequency word
number of relevant items retrieved

There are two lines of future work:
First, the results from information retrieval ex-
periments often show variances on different kinds
of document collections and different sizes of collec-
tions. It is thus desirable to test the noun phrase
parsing technique in other and larger collections.
More experiments and analyses are also needed to
better understand how to more effectively combine
different phrases with single words. In addition, it
is very important to study how such phrase effects
interact with other useful IR techniques such as rel-
evancy feedback, query expansion, and term weight-
ing.
Second, it is desirable to study how the parsing
quality (e.g., in terms of the ratio of phrases parsed
correctly) would affect the retrieval performance. It
is very interesting to try the conditional probabil-
ity model as mentioned in a footnote in section 3
The improvement of the probabilistic model of noun
phrase parsing may result in phrases of higher qual-
ity than the phrases produced by the current noun
phrase parser. Intuitively, the use of higher qual-
ity phrases might enhance document indexing more
effectively, but this again needs to be tested.

<abstract confidence="0.99823188">Information Retrieval (IR) is an important application area of Natural Language Processing (NLP) where one encounters the genuine challenge of processing large quantities of unrestricted natural language text. While much effort has been made to apply NLP techniques to IR, very few NLP techniques have been evaluated on a document collection larger than several megabytes. Many NLP techniques are simply not efficient enough, and not robust enough, to handle a large amount of text. This paper proposes a new probabilistic model for noun phrase parsing, and reports on the application of such a parsing technique to enhance document indexing. The effectiveness of using syntactic phrases provided by the parser to supplement single words for indexing is evaluated with a 250 megabytes document collection. The experiment&apos;s results show that supplementing single words with syntactic phrases for indexing consistently and significantly improves retrieval performance.</abstract>
