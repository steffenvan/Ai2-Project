We are pleased to present the 10 papers that have been accepted for presentation at the first HLT/NAACL
Doctoral Consortium (New York City, June 2006). The goal of this event is to create an opportunity
for a group of senior Ph.D. students to discuss and explore their research and career objectives with a
panel of researchers in the fields of natural language processing, speech technology, and information
retrieval. The event is also an opportunity for students to gain exposure for their work among the entire
HLT/NAACL research community.
On June 4, 2006, the 10 participating students share their research in the form of short “job talk”
presentations and receive feedback from a panel of researchers drawn from industry and academia. The
day also includes a panel presentation by established researchers on the topic of “How to best present
yourself on the academic/industrial job market.” We would like to thank all of the researchers who have
volunteered to serve on panels throughout the day.
Students also participate in a poster session held during the main HLT/NAACL conference and have
their professional biography, research abstract, and photograph included in a face book to be distributed
to all attendees of HLT/NAACL-2006.
This year, we received 18 submissions representing 8 countries. We would like to thank all of the
authors who have submitted their work to this event.
We are grateful for the help and support of our faculty advisor Mitch Marcus and the HLT/NAACL-
2006 main conference organizers, especially Bob Moore, Satoshi Sekine, Brian Roark, Jennifer Chu-
Carroll, Mark Sanderson, Jeff Bilmes, Ed Hovy, Patrick Pantel, and Priscilla Rasmussen. We are also
grateful for the advice we’ve received from Lillian Lee during the planning of this event. Finally, we
gratefully acknowledge the National Science Foundation and Microsoft Corp., whose support will make
it possible to provide financial assistance to the presenters.
