This book describes Word Manager (WM), a
lexical database system intended to serve a
wide range of NLP applications. The most
striking aspect of WM itself, and of this pre-
sentation, is its windowed user interface. The
book consists of five chapters (&apos;Introduction,&apos;
&apos;The Word Manager Approach,&apos; Inflection,&apos;
&apos;Wordformation&apos; [sic], and &apos;Linguistic Theo-
ries&apos;) and a lengthy appendix giving syntax
definitions for the user language.
A WM linguistic description consists of
a tree-shaped hierarchy whose nodes con-
tain declarations, feature specifications, and
rules and entries of various kinds. Each node
is identified by a feature set and associated
with a window, the label of the node being
inherited by those below it in the tree.
Affixation in its simplest form is indi-
cated by juxtaposing feature specifications
that identify the segments concerned. More
complex cases requiring spelling adjustments
at segment boundaries are treated by means
of &apos;match and map&apos; rules. These are regular
expression pattern matchers with bindings
and substitutions, and may be paired with
feature sets that govern their application.
WM spelling rules differ from the more fa-
miliar two-level variety in being ordered. So,
for example, the plural form amici of the Ital-
ian amico &apos;friend&apos; can be produced by adding
h to the stem (as would be done for the nor-
mal case baco, bachi &apos;silkworm&apos;) and then re-
moving it again. The authors adopt without
comment extrinsic rule ordering and radical
non-monotonicity when elsewhere the ten-
dency, shared by many theoretical linguists,
has for some time been to abandon them.
One reason for choosing a hierarchical or-
ganization is that redundancy can be mini-
mized through the use of inheritance. How-
ever, several aspects of WM give rise to
unnecessarily redundant specifications. Pat-
terns in spelling rules must apparently sub-
sume the entire string against which they
match; this leads to the presence of repeated
subexpressions whose only function is to
skip irrelevant characters. What has been
missed here is the fact that the phenomena
these rules are intended to handle are essen-
tially boundary effects. The pattern-matching
component of the rules shows no sign of hav-
ing been designed for, or even adapted to, the
purpose for which it is employed. Similarly,
it seems necessary to specify for each word
segment mentioned in a rule not only its lex-
ical form but also all of its surface forms,
in addition to supplying spelling rules that
implicitly express the same correspondence.
The intention is to permit cross-checking dur-
ing compilation, but the tracing facilities of-
fered by WM should make this unnecessary.
There is a general impression of piecemeal
design, almost as if the shell of WM had been
developed without regard to linguistic con-
siderations and then fleshed out with rules
and entries at the last moment when it was
too late to change anything.
But the real weak point of this book lies
less in WM itself than in the presentation.
Typically, this proceeds by describing some
morphological phenomenon, and comparing
two or three possible analyses. The emphasis
is entirely on examples and the syntax of the
system; nowhere do we find a clear statement
of how the syntax is to be interpreted, an
account of the formal properties of the var-
ious mechanisms employed, or proper mo-
tivation for the choice of these mechanisms
rather than others. There are some interest-
ing ideas hidden below the surface (morpho-
logical rules can be specialized to handle ex-
ceptions, feature values are used to encode
paths through the hierarchy), but it is hard
to evaluate them in this form.
The first chapter sets out to provide jus-
tification for WM and draws comparisons
with other approaches to morphology and
lexical organization. The authors&apos; awareness
of such work seems quite rudimentary: the
three contrasted approaches are finite-state
lexicons with two-level rules (Koskenniemi
1983), DATR (Evans and Gazdar 1990), and
the Celex databases. No mention is made
of, for example, the lexical knowledge base
created for the Acquilex project (Copestake
[1992] is a recent report, but the project has
been well publicized for much longer), or
the large amount of work that has been
done by Bear (1988), Trost (1991), and oth-

ers to augment the original two-level method
with more powerful devices. The omissions
would be less damaging had the authors not
couched the discussion in terms of an eval-
uation of competing proposals from which
WM emerges as the victor. The chapter as a
whole is marked by a distastefully patron-
izing tone, and contains many unsupported
and contentious statements.
Finally, it seems to me that the authors
have greatly overestimated the utility of their
approach. The central idea is that WM will
provide a purely morphological resource for
a wide range of applications, including MT,
spelling correctors, text-to-speech, and so on,
in a client-server arrangement. Most of these
require other kinds of information (phono-
logical, semantic, translation, etc.), which
WM provides no natural way of express-
ing. As a result, in order to support any but
the most trivial application, a parallel dictio-
nary must be created and accessed alongside
that available via WM. Contrary to the au-
thors&apos; claim, this is not simply a matter of
building an interface; it is likely often to re-
quire at least as much work as creating the
original dictionary. Given the network con-
text they assume, maintaining consistency
between the two sets of data will impose an
extra burden.
The book is a strange mixture, and not
one that I can recommend. Some parts of
it (like the desultory and shallow &amp;quot;evalua-
tion of other approaches&amp;quot;) are reminiscent
of a dissertation, while others (annotations
to the appendix and a description of some
bizarre conventions concerning the interpre-
tation of white space) read like a satirical par-
ody of a user manual; interspersed with the
surrounding system description is a naïve
and unconvincing sales pitch.—Graham Rus-

For many years, Herbert Clark has studied
the pragmatics of how people actually use
language and how reality differs from neat
linguistic theory. His research brings together
the methods and theories of experimental
psycholinguistics, sociolinguistics, and inten-
tional analyses of language; and a knowledge
of Clark&apos;s research and his results is impor-
tant for anyone in computational linguistics
who wants to make computers use language
in the same way that people do. Many read-
ers of this journal will already be familiar
with Clark&apos;s work; those who aren&apos;t will find
Arenas of Language Use to be a convenient in-
troduction.
The book contains 12 papers by Clark and
his students and colleagues, all but one of
them previously published (between 1981
and 1991), that weave together, in differ-
ent ways, Clark&apos;s central themes: the crucial
role in language understanding of common
ground and mutual knowledge among con-
versation participants; the collaborative na-
ture of conversation; the difference between
merely hearing a conversation and partici-
pating in it; and the methods by which con-
versants construct and understand referring
expressions.
Almost all the papers remain up-to-date
and relevant. (The only exceptions are the

What a welcome addition to the collection of
books on machine translation research this
book is! Although this volume of six articles
spans an eclectic mix of linguistic issues and
theoretical approaches, this range reflects the
current refreshing burst of energy in the field.
Aficionados of lexical-functional grammar
can jump to Sadler&apos;s chapter for one view
of the broader ongoing debate to define both
the strengths and limits of this linguistic the-
ory as extended to MT research. (For an-
other recent contribution to the debate, see
Kaplan and Wedekind 1993.) The chapter
also contains several &amp;quot;translationally rele-
vant&amp;quot; arguments in favor of shifting the LFG-
based computational approach from one that
is &amp;quot;structural&amp;quot; (or recursive) to one that is
constraint-based.
By contrast, those interested in depen-
dency theory can turn to Badia&apos;s chapter.
There the dependency-theory concepts of
governor and dependency relations provide
the theoretical framework for one level of
representation in MT systems, namely the
&amp;quot;interface structures&amp;quot; that encode the source
or input language sentence at the final stage
of analysis, just before translation per se be-
gins in a transfer-based system. The semantic
predicative relations presented here, as well
as their limitations, are well known to MT
researchers (see Hutchins and Somers 1992).
What will be intriguing to those involved
in interlingua research is the particular way
that relations traditionally captured in inter-
lingual structures have been integrated into
the transfer-based approach.
Another view of MT research comes from
the chapters that address the general re-
quirements that any MT system must meet
if it is to handle the translation of specific
types of linguistic data: unbounded depen-
dencies, prepositions, and the subparts of
words. These chapters, by Allegranza, Du-
rand, and Bennett respectively, lean more ex-
tensively on the reader&apos;s background knowl-
edge of general linguistics than do the two
theory-specific chapters mentioned above. Of
all the research challenges raised by these
three authors, Bennett has identified the one
that is still the most neglected: developing
principles for the compositional translation
of subparts of words. This shows up, as it
were, close to home: though Durand does
not focus at this level in his chapter, he too
will eventually have to work on translating
the subparts of words—prepositions in one
language can translate to affixes in other lan-
guages.
Finally a word about the editor&apos;s chapter
in the book: Van Eynde holds the uncon-
troversial position that transfer-based sys-
tems are too difficult and costly to scale
up, and furthermore, that their design is
not optimized for reusability. His design re-
quirements for addressing these issues are
that transfer-based MT systems must be
cleanly divided into monolingual and bilin-
gual modules, and that the functions of the
bilingual modules should be reduced as far
as possible. The most fascinating part of this
chapter is Van Eynde&apos;s proposal for this re-
duction: the closed-class elements are to be
represented interlingually and removed from
the bilingual modules. Perhaps Van Eynde&apos;s
proposal will inspire even the staunchest of
interlingua proponents to take a new look
at transfer-based MT research.—Clare R. Voss,

This book is an introduction to formal
semantics, especially Montague semantics,
within a linguistic framework. It presup-
poses no previous background in logic, but
takes the student from simple predicate–
argument structures and their interpretation
through to Montague&apos;s intensional logic, cov-
ering set theory, propositional logic, type the-
ory, lambda abstraction, traditional and gen-
eralized quantifiers, inference, tense and as-
pect, possible-worlds semantics, and inten-
sionality. The emphasis throughout is on the
use of logical tools for linguistic semantics,
rather than on purely logical topics, and the
introductory chapter situates formal seman-
tics within the general framework of linguis-
tic semantics. The book assumes some basic
knowledge of linguistics, but aims to be as
nontechnical as possible within a technical
subject.—Adapted from the publisher&apos;s announce-

The authors&apos; awareness of such work seems quite rudimentary: the three contrasted approaches are finite-state lexicons with two-level rules (Koskenniemi 1983), DATR (Evans and Gazdar 1990), and the Celex databases. No mention is made of, for example, the lexical knowledge base created for the Acquilex project (Copestake [1992] is a recent report, but the project has been well publicized for much longer), or the large amount of work that has been done by Bear (1988), Trost (1991), and oth699 Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 4 ers to augment the original two-level method with more powerful devices. The omissions would be less damaging had the authors not couched the discussion in terms of an evaluation of competing proposals from which WM emerges as the victor. The chapter as a whole is marked by a distastefully patronizing tone, and contains many unsupported and contentious statements. Finally, it seems to me that the authors have greatly overestimated the utility of their approach. The central idea is that WM will provide a purely morphological resource fo</context>
