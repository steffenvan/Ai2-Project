1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999854404761905">
Due to Internet grow, the number of available
documents grows dramatically. There is a strategic
need for companies to produce and manage
information written in more than 30 languages
(HP, IBM, MS, Caterpillar). This requires
powerful tools to manage multilingual documents.
Current techniques for handling multilingual
documents use large-grained linking (at the level
of HTML pages), but don&apos;t allow fine-grained
synchronization (at paragraph or sentence level)
and don&apos;t permit bilingual or multilingual editing
through the Web.
The interest to synchronize at least at the level of
sentences is double:
■ make it possible to use Machine Aided Human
Translation (MAHT) techniques, in particular
translation memories, for translating and
postediting multilingual documents.
■ add UNL tags at sentence level to store the
translations as well as UNL hypergraphs
(anglosemantic interlingual representations),
from which raw (or rough!) translations into
other languages can be obtained from distant
&amp;quot;deconversion&amp;quot; servers.
Here, we are not concerned with the problem of
aligning parallel monolingual documents, or
realigning them after they have been modified, a
frequent need in the case of leaflets and booklets.
(Assimi,2000) proposed a tool to handle the non-
centralized management of the evolution of
multilingual parallel documents. We consider the
case, frequent in the industry, where documents are
managed centrally, even if they are distributed on
several sites. What happens in general is that they
are aligned at the level of large blocks, with one
file per block and language (fileXXX.en.htm,
fileXXX.fr.htm etc. for HTML pages).
What we propose is to align them at the level of
sentences, but of course not to have one file per
sentence. Rather, if there are N languages, for a
given &amp;quot;block&amp;quot; corresponding to some unit of
processing (e.g. visualization), we will have either

<bodyText confidence="0.999952754385965">
The PolyphraZ tool is being developed in the
framework of the TraCorpEx project
(Translation of Corpora of Examples), to
manage parallel multilingual corpora through
the web. Corpus files (monolingual or
multilingual) are firstly converted to a
standard coding (CXM.dtd, UTF8). Then, they
are assembled (CPXM.dtd) to visualize them
in parallel through the web. In a third stage,
they are put in a Multilingual Polyphraz
Memory (MPM). A &amp;quot;polyphrase&amp;quot; is a structure
containing an original sentence and various
proposals of equivalent sentences, in the same
and other languages. An MPM stores one or
more corpora of polyphrazes. The MPM part
of PolyphraZ has 3 main web interfaces. One
is a web-oriented translator workstation
(TWS), where suggestions or translations
come from the MPM itself, which functions as
its own translation memory, and from calls to
MT systems. Another serves to send sentences
to MT systems with appropriate parameters,
and to run various evaluation measures (NIST,
BLEU, and distance computations) in order to
propose to the translator a &amp;quot;best&amp;quot; proposal. A
third interface is planned for giving feedbacks
to the developers of the MT systems, in the
form of lists of unknown or wrongly translated
words, with suggestions for correct
translations, and of parallel presentation of
pairs of translations showing the &amp;quot;editing
work&amp;quot; to be done to get one from the other.
The first 2 stages are operational, and used for
experimentation and MT evaluation on the
CSTAR 5-lingual BTEC corpus and on the
Japanese-English Tanaka corpus used as a
source of examples in electronic dictionaries
(JDict, Papillon). A main goal of this effort is
to offer occasional and volunteer translators
and posteditors access to a free TWS and to
sharable translation memories put in the MPM
format.
N monolingual sentence-aligned files, or 1
multilingual file. In both cases, sentences or place
holders for sentences will be linked to a MPM to
manage translation and postedition.
We began to build PolyphraZ in the context of
the TraCorpEx project (Translation of Corpora of
Examples). A more recent motivation is to extend
the BTEC corpus of CSTAR III (163000 sentences
in tourism) to French and Arabic, and to evaluate
various Chinese-English MT systems on it.
We will first present the data we start with, and
our goals in more detail. In a second part, we will
describe the architecture of PolyphraZ, starting
from scenarios of use and types of users. Lastly,
we will describe the current status of this work.

2 TraCorpEx and PolyphraZ
2.1 Context
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999972333333333">
The TraCorpEx project has several contexts: the
Papillon project (Papillon) of co-operative
construction of a large multilingual lexical base on
the Web, the C-STAR III project (C-STAR III) of
translation of spoken dialogues, a French and
Tunisian project (Hajlaoui, Boitet, 2003b), the
UNL project (UNL) of communication and
multilingual information system, and the PhD
research of the various participants in this project.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.9999">
2.2 Current data and problems
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999838019607844">
We have initially 2 &amp;quot;parallel&amp;quot; corpora, structured
differently.
■ The BTEC corpus of C-STAR is made of 5
sets of 163 files of 12K to 40K, each
containing 1000 sentences, in English,
Japanese (coded in EUC), Chinese and
Korean, for a total of 6.1 Mo per language.
■ The TANAKA corpus (Japanese-English),
given to the Papillon project a few months
before the death of its author in 2002, is made
of 45 files for a total of 18.4 Mo. It contains
sentences of newspapers or teaching works of
NHK for the training of English by the
Japanese. Each file is bilingual.
We have also corpora from the UNL project,
where each document is a multilingual file
containing for each sentence its text in source
language, a UNL graph, the result of
deconversions in a certain number of languages,
and possibly their revisions, or direct manual
translations.
All these &amp;quot;parallel&amp;quot; corpora are aligned at the
level of sentences. As it would be interesting to
show correspondences at finer levels (syntagms,
chunks, words), we design PolyphraZ to later add
tools for subsential alignement such as the one
developed by Ch. Chenon for his Ph.D.
In other corpora, we may be obliged to go up to
the level of paragraphs, because sentences will not
be aligned perfectly. That will not be done
completely in PolyphraZ, but at the level of the
structure of the multilingual document itself: if 2
sentences are translated by 3, each of the 5
sentences will be in a different polyphrase, with
their individual translations, and there will be
another polyphrase, of &amp;quot;n-m&amp;quot; type, to contain the 2
complete segements.
The first problem we encounter with the
available parallel corpora it is that there is no tool
to visualize their contents at a glance, sentence by
sentence, nor to show the fine correspondences
between subsentential segments. In addition, in the
case of UNL documents, we cannot visualize at the
same time a sentences in several languages and its
corresponding UNL graph. Lastly, it is not possible
to see successive versions in parallel.
When it comes to evaluation, we can only see
the monolingual files, and associated statistical
measurements (NIST, BLEU...), but we can never
confront them with the real translations and make a
direct subjective evaluation.

2.3 Detailed objectives
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998135">
The objectives of TraCorpEx project are as
follows.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.986055">
2.3.1 Construction of a software platform
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999619285714286">
We want to build an environment, which
supports the import and the export of parallel
corpora, the preparation of the data for automatic
translators, the postedition (HAMT), the evaluation
(various feedbacks methods) and finally a
preparation of &amp;quot;feedbacks&amp;quot; to the developers of
used MT systems.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99838">
2.3.2 Addition of new languages
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999971">
Starting from parallel corpora, we want to add
one or more languages (those of the Papillon
project for the Tanaka corpus, French and Arabic
for the BTEC corpus).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.988684">
2.3.3 Evaluation of MT systems
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999953230769231">
We also wish that the same platform makes it
possible to evaluate automatic translators with
automatic methods such as NIST, BLEU, PER, and
to use this possibility in CSTAR, to evaluate the
Chinese-English and Japanese-English translations.
To evaluate the results of various MT systems will
also enable us to determine &amp;quot;the best&amp;quot; (or less bad!)
translation, proposable to a contributor as a starting
point for revision.
We also want to test a hypothesis by the second
author: the quality of the translations could also be
evaluated using calculations of distances between
sentences and reverse translations.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.547505">
2.3.4 Feedbacks to developers of MT systems
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999973416666667">
We also want to give feedbacks to the
developers of the systems used (unknown words,
badly translated sentences...), and a comparative
presentation between the various translation
systems.
The whole of the objectives of this project led
us to propose interactive Web interfaces allowing
us to chooses, use, compare, publish machine
translations corresponding to several language
pairs, and to contribute to the improvement of the
results by sending feedbacks to the developers of
these systems.

2.4 The PolyphraZ platform
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999901222222222">
PolyphraZ is a software platform making it
possible at the same time to visualize the available
corpora on the Web by showing several languages,
with the choice of the user and to work on a basis
of &amp;quot;polyphrases&amp;quot; initialised from these corpora
while making it possible to control all functions
described above (call of MT systems, distance
computation, collaborative postedition,
evaluation).

2.4.2 Intended users of PolyphraZ
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.974201666666667">
We distinguish four principal users: the preparer,
the reader (&amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; user), the posteditor and the
manager.
■ The preparer
His role consists in calling translation systems,
thereby parameterizing them as well as pos-
sible, which supposes a certain linguistic
ability (to compare the results of various
parameter settings, and of various segmenta-
tions in &amp;quot;blocks&amp;quot;, each corresponding to some
parameter settings).
The preparer can also call objective evaluation
methods (NIST, BLEU...) on the results of
translation, tune with parameters to compute
distances between sentences (results of
translation and/or reverse translations), and
post the results. The distance computation
produces, in addition to a value, a XML string
from which a “track changes” presentation can
be generated. The preparer can also set the
parameters determining &amp;quot;the best&amp;quot; suggestion
among the various translation candidates.
■ The reader (normal user)
A reader can visualize the data (the original,
various translations, and distances between the
character strings) through Web interfaces, but
is not allowed to edit the translations.
■ The translator-posteditor
The translator-posteditor is a contributor who
translates from scratch or revises proposed
translations (MT results or translations of
similar sentences found in the MPM or in other
TM put in CPXM or MPM format). There is
an editable area to modify the active sentence.
One can also ask for global modifications (ex:
&amp;quot;SVP&amp;quot; changed into &amp;quot;s&apos;il vous plait&amp;quot; in tran-
scribed spoken utterances) and correct or sup-
plement the local dictionary attached to the
MPM. The system uses the reference sentences
already produced like a translation memory.
PolyphraZ is thus also a system of assistance
to the translator, limited to the translation of
sets of sentences (or titles), with less function-
alities than commercial TWS, but usable for
collaborative volunteer work by non-
professionals.
■ The manager
The last type of user is the manager, who will
produce from a MPM &amp;quot;feedbacks&amp;quot; for the de-
velopers of the MT systems used. A manager
cans himself be a developer of an MT system.
He can draw up a list of unknown words and
words badly translated by each system (pro-
duced from the traces of distance computa-
tions). A second function is to propose for
these words suggestions of translation from the
&amp;quot;reference&amp;quot; translations obtained after human

2.6 Evaluation of translation results
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999025">
We have programmed and integrad in
PolyphraZ three evaluation methods (NIST, BLEU
and distance calculation). NIST and BLEU are
well known. Let us give more details about
distance calculation between 2 sentences.
The distance we compute between two strings is
a linear combination of two edit distances, one at
the level of characters, the other at the level of
words. In general, the edit distance between two
strings P1 and P2 of atoms (characters or words
here) is the minimal number of suppressions,
insertions or replacements of atoms necessary to
transform P1 into P2 or, equivalently, P2 into P1.
To compute the edit distance between P1 and P2 at
the level of words, one segments them into words,
computes the character distances between words of
P1 and words of P2, and then computes the word
distance using words as &amp;quot;large characters&amp;quot;.
We use the well-known dynamic programming
algorithm of (Wagner, Fischer, 1974). To combine
the two levels (characters and words), we use the
formula:

This representation corresponds to the
presentation used by Microsoft Word in
&amp;quot;Track changes&amp;quot; mode. It is very readable. In
certain cases, the representation at the level of
the characters is more compact and readable
that at the level of words, while it is the
opposite in other cases. In fact, this
representation is not &amp;quot;faithful&amp;quot; to the trace,
because a sequence of exchanges is
transformed into a sequence of suppressions
and a sequence of insertions.

3 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999924629629629">
The CXM and CPXM levels of PolyphraZ are
already used. They have allow us to import the
BTEC multilingual corpus of parallel sentences
(into the common CPM format), to transform it
(163000 sentenes in 5 languages) into files in
CPXM formats, and to visualize it1 on the web.
The Tanaka corpus should be available when this
paper will be presented. The &amp;quot;inner&amp;quot; level of MPM
(Multilingual Polyphrase Memory) is almost
completed. It will also support versioning.
In the future, we plan to use MPMs not only to
handle multilingual corpora of parallel sentences,
but also like &amp;quot;pivots&amp;quot;, to establish the sentence-
level correspondence between parallel monolingual
structured documents. If no high quality TWS (like
Trados, TM2, Déjà Vu; Transit, etc.) is available,
PolyphraZ could be used as a &amp;quot;bare bone&amp;quot; TWS,
directly through the web, in the Montaigne2 spirit.
We are also studying how to integrate into a
MPM structure &amp;quot;generators&amp;quot; specifying classes of
sentences (automata for messages with variables
and variants, regular expressions for CSTAR IF
expressions, etc.), and to use them to extend a
MPM not only &amp;quot;in width&amp;quot; (addition of new
languages), but also &amp;quot;in height&amp;quot;, by the automatic
creation of new &amp;quot;statements&amp;quot;, natural and/or
formal.
