1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999979709677419">
Although there is an extensive body of research
concerned with anaphora resolution (e.g. (Fox,
1987; Grosz et al., 1995)), event anaphora has
been widely neglected. This paper describes
the results of an empirical study regarding event
reference. The experiment investigated event
anaphora in narrative discourse via a sentence
completion task. The results of the experiment
suggest that the discourse structure established by
an explanation or elaboration relation has an in-
fluence on whether the last mentioned event, pre-
viously mentioned events or a complex event is
preferably referred to.
First, a short introduction is given to the ob-
servation that reference by the demonstrative pro-
noun this can only be done to antecedents men-
tioned in segments at the right frontier of the dis-
course structure tree (Webber, 1991). Second, al-
though the right frontier restriction is generally
agreed on by researchers, it is still unclear what
kind of information is actually stored on higher
levels of the discourse tree. Segmented Discourse
Structure Theory (SDRT) is introduced (Asher,
1993) and the predictions of this theory are dis-
cussed regarding event anaphora for two example
discourses. These predictions are also compared
with the predictions according to Webber (1991).
Neither theory adequately explains the results
of the current experiment. Thus the presentation
concludes with an outline of a proposed computa-
tional theory.

ten by a snake once. (d) This was unfor-
tunate.
The pronoun this in (1d) may refer to the en-
tire situation described by (la) through (lc). But
there are other conceivable antecedents for this.
The situation described by (lc) may be referred
to by this as well, if we consider an alternation of
(1d) as in the following:
(1&apos;) d&apos;. This was quite dangerous.
The example discourse illustrates that the dis-
course in (la-c) is organised hierarchically and
consists of different discourse segments (e.g. (la-
c) and (lb-c)). Webber (1991) points out that
events are only available for anaphoric reference
when they are mentioned by the last utterance
(e.g. (lc)) or by the situation that is constructed
by the preceding discourse segment (e.g. (la-c)).
The right frontier hypothesis reflects this observa-
tion as shown by bold typeset in figure 1. The dis-

course structure also influences how we conceptu-
alise situations described in a text. In particular,
a segment in (la-c) establishes a complex event
that can be referred to.

3 Predictions

Unfortunately, there is much disagreement be-
tween theoretical approaches to discourse process-
ing on what exactly is available on the right fron-
tier. The tree structure proposed by Webber, for
example, contains the semantic content grouped
together for the entire segment.

Asher (1993), on the other hand, defines open
attachment sites of the discourse structure by the
term openness via rhetorical relations. Only elab-
oration and explanation allow reference to an-
tecedents mentioned in sentences other than the
current one. An explanation relation holds, for
example, between (2h) and (2c) (and elaboration
between (313) and (3c) see below):

<bodyText confidence="0.987622583333333">
Following Webber&apos;s account, this can only refer to
the situation described by the last utterance (2c)
or the situations described by the sentences (2b-c)
or (2a-c), but not to (2a) and (2c).
In contrast, SDRT predicts that the situations
described by sentence (2b) or (2c) are available,
but not by (2a) nor any combined situation.
Consequently, the empirical investigation fo-
cuses especially on the question of which described
events are available for further attachments and
event anaphora depending on the chosen rhetori-
cal relation (i.e. explanation or elaboration).

4 Experimental data
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98037806060606">
Six ambiguous sequences such as (2) or (3) were
presented to 115 participants. They were asked
first to continue the sentences and then to specify
explicitly what this referred to.
(3) Saturday was Jerry&apos;s birthday. Several
students organized a dinner for Jerry.
Some students had written fancy invita-
tion cards. This was...
Note that the results as shown by table 1 can-
not be explained by either theoretical approach.
The results for the explanation relation is best ex-
plained by Webber, since either the last mentioned
situation or a combined situation of the segments
(2b-c) were most often chosen by the participants.
On the other hand, results for the elaboration re-
lation contradict the predictions made. The sit-
uation described by (3b) should not be available
according to Webber&apos;s account, instead an ambi-
guity between (3b) and (3c) can be observed for
this sequence. This would be predicted by SDRT.
But SDRT cannot explain the combination of two
situations that was chosen by subjects 18% of the
time for an explanation relation.2
Results suggest that the type of rhetorical re-
lation has a crucial influence. An explanation re-
lation linking (2b) and (2c) focuses on the sen-
tence describing the cause (i.e. the last utterance),
whereas an elaboration relation as in (3) estab-
lishes an ambiguous sequence between the last two
described situations. In addition, note that a sig-
nificant proportion of the participants referred to
a combined event regardless of the rhetorical rela-
tion.

5 A computational model
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999987421052632">
A computational model could benefit from the re-
sults presented in this paper. First, the choice of
rhetorical relation should affect the way possible
antecedents are represented for anaphora resolu-
tion. Second, the current data as well as data from
reading experiments, for instance, could be used
to determine the likelihood of possible attachment
sites in the discourse structure.
However, another question remains: what
should the representation of a complex event look
like? The tree structure proposed by Webber con-
tains the semantic content grouped together for
the entire segment. It seems more plausible that
at a higher level of a discourse some form of ab-
straction takes place.
Future research must focus on the information
that is available from preceding text and what
is obtainable for anaphoric expressions such as
demonstrative pronouns and definite descriptions.
