This paper reports on and demonstrates
META-SHARE/QT21, a prototype im-
plementation of a data sharing and an-
notation service platform, which was
based on the META-SHARE infrastruc-
ture. META-SHARE, which has been
designed for sharing datasets and tools,
is enhanced with a processing layer for
annotating textual content with appro-
priate NLP services that are documented
with the appropriate metadata. In
META-SHARE/QT21 pre-defined pro-
cessing workflows are offered to the us-
ers; each workflow is a pipeline of
atomic NLP services/tools (e.g. sen-
tence splitting, part-of-speech tagging).
Currently, workflows for annotating
monolingual and bilingual resources of
various formats are provided (e.g.
XCES, TXT, TMX). From the legal
framework point of view, a simple op-
erational model is adopted by which on-
ly openly licensed datasets can be
processed by openly licensed services.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.990141907407408">
Language technology research and development
relies on the deployment of appropriate resources
and processing services more than ever before.
However, the resources and services landscape is
unorganized and highly fragmented (Soria et al.,
2012). Recently, initiatives like CLARIN (Wit-
tenburg et al., 2010), Language Grid (Ishida,
2011), Panacea (Poch and Bel, 2011), LAPPS
Grid (Ide et al., 2014) have been launched aim-
ing at improving discoverability and accessibility
of resources and services, as well as their lawful
re-use and direct deployment in modern compu-
tational environments. In this paper, we present
META-SHARE/QT21, a prototype implementa-
tion of a linguistic data infrastructure enhanced
with linguistic processing services, thus bringing
language datasets and processing services to-
gether in a unified platform. META-
SHARE/QT21 builds upon and extends META-
SHARE (Piperidis, 2012). Section 2 briefly in-
troduces the basics of META-SHARE, the un-
derlying data model and the supporting software
implementation. Section 3 elaborates on the op-
erations of the new language processing layer
and Section 4 presents the assumptions of the
current implementation. Finally, in section 5 we
conclude and present directions of future work.
2 META-SHARE design and repository
META-SHARE is designed as a network of dis-
tributed repositories of language data, tools and
web services, documented with high-quality
metadata, aggregated in central inventories al-
lowing for uniform search and access to re-
sources and services. Language resources and
services are documented with the META-
SHARE metadata schema (Gavrilidou et al.,
2012)1 which builds upon previous initiatives
(Broeder et al., 2010), including elements, most
of which are linked to ISOCat Data Categories1,
as well as relations (e.g. is_part_of,
is_annotation_of) used to describe and link re-
sources that are included in the META-SHARE
repository.
Every resource in META-SHARE is primari-
ly assigned to one of the network&apos;s repositories,
implementing the notion of a master copy of a
resource, with the member maintaining the re-
pository undertaking its curation. Metadata rec-
ords are harvested and stored in the META-
SHARE central servers, which maintain an in-
ventory including metadata of all resources
available in the distributed network. META-
SHARE users, depending on their role, are able
to create a user profile, log-in, browse and search

3 Enhancing META-SHARE with anno-

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99996575">
For the purposes of infrastructural projects where
META-SHARE was to be used as the language
resource sharing platform, notably the CLARIN
EL national language infrastructure4, its func-
tionalities have been extended by providing a
mechanism for processing language datasets with
appropriate natural language services. The moti-
vation behind this extension is twofold: a) to
make language processing services accessible to
and usable by a wide range of users (e.g. lin-
guists, lexicographers, social sciences and digital
humanities researchers), relieving them from the
burden of the technical details of running the
tools or services, and b) to bring these tools and
services together in a unified platform and facili-
tate their combination with language datasets,
thus paving the way towards the organic growth
of the data infrastructure.
Language processing tools are documented
with the appropriate metadata in the enhanced

the Django framework, a Python-based web framework,
PostgreSQL database and Apache web server. META-
SHARE comes with a pre-configured Apache Solr server
used to index the META-SHARE database for browsing
and searching.

repository version (META-SHARE/QT21)5, and
are provided as web services through the lan-
guage processing (LP) layer. The LP layer has
been implemented in Java, based on the Apache
Camel framework6, an open-source project that
provides libraries, which enable the easy integra-
tion of different technologies and the creation of
data processing workflows7. For example, Camel
offers ready-to-use components/connectors for a)
reading the files of a directory b) split-
ting/aggregating their contents (e.g. txt or XML)
into chunks c) forwarding the chunks to data
processors d) writing final results to disk.
In the typical scenario that we propose to
demonstrate, when a registered META-
SHARE/QT21 user selects to process a resource,
a list of all available annotation levels (Figure 1)
is provided. Then all the available tools/services
that correspond to the chosen level are presented
(Figure 2). Annotation services can be atomic or
composite (a.k.a. workflows) and include: to-
kenization, sentence splitting, POS tagging,
lemmatization, dependency parsing, named enti-
ty recognition, and parallel text alignment. As
soon as the user selects a service (Figure 2), the
META-SHARE/QT21 application consults its
database. If the user requests to process a dataset
with a specific service, and this dataset has al-
ready been processed by the specific service,
then the system will forward the user to the pro-
cessed dataset that has been created and stored in
the repository.

Otherwise, META-SHARE/QT21 sends the
user request to the LP layer. When the LP gets
the request, it starts to process the specified re-
source by invoking the appropriate tools; when it
finishes it notifies the META-SHARE/QT21 ap-
plication so that the result of the processing is
added to the META-SHARE/QT21 repository
along with appropriate metadata. Finally, the
META-SHARE/QT21 application sends the user
an email with the link to the newly created re-
source. LP’s workflows are implemented based
on a variety of natural language processing ser-
vices. These services run either within the LP
application environment (loc), or they are ac-
cessed via services (rmt). Currently, OpenNLP8
services (loc) are deployed for English, German
and Portuguese, Panacea-DCU9 services (rmt)
for English, LX-Center/University of Lisbon10
services (rmt) for Portuguese, Heart of Gold
(HoG) services11 (rmt) for German, ILSP NLP12
services (loc) for Greek, and HunAlign (Varga et
al., 2005) text alignment services for aligning
parallel corpora at sentence level (loc).
Each set of workflows forms an acyclic di-
rected graph (tree) where each node corresponds
to a processing service/tool (e.g. Figure 4). The

<bodyText confidence="0.998682064516129">
processing of a data chunk is performed by fol-
lowing a path in such a workflow tree. For ex-
ample, in case the input is raw text the starting
point is the root of the tree. However, LP is also
capable of processing already annotated re-
sources thus saving processing time and re-
sources; i.e., if the user requests to process a
dataset at a level L (e.g. OpenNLP chunking),
and the resource has already been processed at a
level A that is a prerequisite for L (e.g. Open
NLP Tokenization), then the process will start
from the already existing level A annotated re-
source. Also, the system is aware of what annota-
tion levels make sense and therefore are available
for an already processed resource and presents
the corresponding choices (e.g. a POS-tagged
corpus can be parsed or chunked, but not to-
kenised) to the user via the web interface (as in
Figure 1).
Currently, LP implements services and work-
flows that can process a) monolingual resources
in raw text as well as XCES format and b) bilin-
gual resources in TMX, MOSES, and XCES
formats. Bilingual resources, essentially parallel
corpora, are split into their language specific
parts and monolingual processing services are
invoked for each language side.
The resources are stored in the META-
SHARE/QT21 repository in a compressed format
(e.g. .zip, tar.gz, .gz). Before processing starts,
META-SHARE/QT21 decompresses the speci-

fied resource file and then uses an appropriate
reader that splits the content of the extracted files
in smaller text (data) chunks, so that any file size
constraints that a service might have can be met.
These chunks are then forwarded to the appropri-
ate processing service/workflow. As soon as the
META-SHARE/QT21 has completed the data
processing a symmetric procedure collects the
resulting (annotated) data chunks and merges
them in a single compressed resource.
Additional features of the implemented infra-
structure include: a) mechanisms for automatical-
ly creating the metadata records of the newly
generated datasets, as a result of processing using
an annotation service or workflow, b) discovera-
bility of processing services for a particular lan-
guage and annotation level by simple or faceted
search, c) describing and uploading of user-
owned datasets up to a size limit (in compressed
format) depending on the user’s status (Figure 3),
d) temporarily storing user-owned processed da-
tasets for 48 hours and deleting them afterwards,
unless the user decides to publicly share them, e)
checking processed resources for potential errors
(e.g. number of files processed as expected), f)
monitoring progress of all processing requests
and using mechanisms to prevent the application
from hanging when waiting for a service re-
sponse, g) automatically cancelling processing
requests that either hang for a long period (e.g.
due to network connectivity problems) or are not
executed correctly (e.g. when the encoding or
the format is not compatible with a service/tool)
h) concurrently executing several workflows or
parts of a workflow.

Initially, we conducted a set of user tests which
aimed at spotting bugs; then we assessed the sta-
bility and usability of META-SHARE/QT21 by
asking 15 users to complete a list of 8 annotation
tasks for resources of various formats and lan-
guages. All testers were researchers and they
managed to locate or create the needed resources,
submit their requests and receive the annotation
results within a few hours without problems.
Completion times varied depending on the re-
quested task.
In addition, we assessed the performance and
scalability of the LP application by testing it with
resources of various lengths depending on the
workflow.

Locally running services (tools that run within
our application) were tested with resources of
1MB, 10MB and 50MB. Remote services were
tested with smaller resources of 500KB, 5MB
and 10MB. First, each tool/service was tested
separately (not concurrently) so as to assess its
processing efficiency. Then, we initiated concur-
rent workflows. All performed tests, concurrent
or not, were completed successfully generating
the expected output, with the processing times of
all growing linearly with resource size; (Figure
5). The tests have also shown that LP application
can handle in parallel at least 4 workflows that
process ~200MB of data. We plan to handle the
processing overload that can be generated by
multiple user request for large datasets by using
multiple instances of the Camel-based LP in a
distributed environment (e.g. Hadoop) in which
processing will be carried out in parallel.

4 Assumptions and limitations
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999591666666667">
Currently, each META-SHARE/QT21 workflow
chains together components or services of the
same suite of tools, e.g. OpenNLP or the Pana-
cea/DCU services. To accommodate cases where
the services deployed belong to different suites,
we have developed the appropriate converters.
For example, in a UIMA-based tree, where a
GATE-based Named Entity Recogniser (NER) is
integrated in the respective NER workflow, the
UIMA output of the processing services preced-
ing named entity recognition is converted to the
GATE format and is fed to the GATE-
compatible NER (e.g. Tokenizer → Splitter →
POS-Tagger → UIMA-GATE Converter →
NER).

Enabling the user to define and deploy custom
workflows, cross-suite or not, is on our agenda
for the immediate future. The implementation of
cross-suite workflows requires the development
of several data format converters for each pair of
different technologies (e.g. UIMA-GATE,
OpenNLP-Panacea/DCU). There are several per-
formance, compatibility and interoperability is-
sues that arise in such cases and have to be
investigated and addressed, especially in the light
of Language Grid and LAPPS Grid develop-
ments (Ide et al., 2014).
Last, but not least, considering the experi-
mental META-SHARE/QT21 repository opera-
tions from the legal framework point of view, we
have adopted a rather simple operational model
by which only openly licensed, with no no-
derivatives restriction, datasets can be processed
by openly licensed services and workflows. In
future versions, in collaboration with other infra-
structure providers, we intend to elaborate on a
business logic that will allow processing of oth-
erwise licensed datasets and services supporting
the appropriate business models.

The demonstration presented META-
SHARE/QT21, a data sharing and annotation
service infrastructure. META-SHARE/QT21 is
based on META-SHARE, an open-source data
infrastructure platform and a language processing
layer. The latter is implemented using a widely
used integration framework which enables easy
creation of data workflows by providing appro-
priate mechanisms and components for gluing
different technologies, services and data sources
(XML, txt, TMX). This capability is very useful
in a data processing platform, since there is a) an
abundance of NLP and machine learning tools
implemented (or offered) using different tech-
nologies and libraries (e.g. UIMA, GATE, SOAP
services, etc.) and b) a variety of data formats
(e.g. XCES, TMX). The user evaluation that we
conducted has shown that META-SHARE/QT21
can be easily used by NLP researchers for ob-
taining annotations on a set of resources of vari-
ous formats. Also a set of stress tests that we
conducted revealed that the LP layer can process
concurrently a significant amount of data. We are
now investigating how data annotation can run
on multiple machines in a distributed environ-
ment (e.g. Hadoop clusters), thus enabling the
processing of large volumes of data.

Language resources and services are documented with the METASHARE metadata schema (Gavrilidou et al., 2012)1 which builds upon previous initiatives (Broeder et al., 2010), including elements, most of which are linked to ISOCat Data Categories1, as well as relations (e.g. is_part_of, is_annotation_of) used to describe and link resources that are included in the META-SHARE repository. Every resource in META-SHARE is primarily assigned to one of the network&apos;s repositories, implementing the notion of a master copy of a resource, with the member maintaining the repository undertaking its curation. Metadata records are harvested and stored in the METASHARE central servers, which maintain an inventory inc</context>

Currently, workflows for annotating monolingual and bilingual resources of various formats are provided (e.g. XCES, TXT, TMX). From the legal framework point of view, a simple operational model is adopted by which only openly licensed datasets can be processed by openly licensed services. 1 Introduction Language technology research and development relies on the deployment of appropriate resources and processing services more than ever before. However, the resources and services landscape is unorganized and highly fragmented (Soria et al., 2012). Recently, initiatives like CLARIN (Wittenburg et al., 2010), Language Grid (Ishida, 2011), Panacea (Poch and Bel, 2011), LAPPS Grid (Ide et al., 2014) have been launched aiming at improving discoverability and accessibility of resources and services, as well as their lawful re-use and direct deployment in modern computational environments. In this paper, we present META-SHARE/QT21, a prototype implementation of a linguistic data infrastructure enhanced with linguistic processing services, thus bringing language datasets and processing services together in a unified platform.

The implementation of cross-suite workflows requires the development of several data format converters for each pair of different technologies (e.g. UIMA-GATE, OpenNLP-Panacea/DCU). There are several performance, compatibility and interoperability issues that arise in such cases and have to be investigated and addressed, especially in the light of Language Grid and LAPPS Grid developments (Ide et al., 2014). Last, but not least, considering the experimental META-SHARE/QT21 repository operations from the legal framework point of view, we have adopted a rather simple operational model by which only openly licensed, with no noderivatives restriction, datasets can be processed by openly licensed services and workflows. In future versions, in collaboration with other infrastructure providers, we intend to elaborate on a business logic that will allow processing of otherwise licensed datasets and services supporting the appropriate business models. 5 Conclusions and Future Work The demonstration prese</context>
