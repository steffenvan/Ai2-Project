For the past 25 years, Bernard Vauquois headed a series
of machine translation projects at the University of
Grenoble in France that were distinguished by the
consistent exploration of sophisticated computational
linguistic techniques. A paper describing a significant
part of this work, entitled &amp;quot;Automated Translation at
Grenoble University&amp;quot; (co-authored with Christian
Boitet), appeared in the January-March 1985 issue of
Computational Linguistics [Volume 11, Number 1].
However, throughout his life he was a continuous source
of new ideas and new projects and a powerful presence
nationally and internationally in the field of machine
translation. That his influence was not just local is illus-
trated by the EUROTRA project, the inception of which
owes much to his efforts. Over the last five years he was
instrumental in establishing, in both Malaysia and Thai-
land, research groups that are developing machine trans-
lation systems for the indigenous languages. In fact, it
was in Penang that the leukemia, which claimed his life,
resulted in hospitalization. He was transferred to Paris
and seemed on the road to recovery when lung compli-
cations led to his death.
From 1969 to 1984 Professor Vauquois chaired the
International Committee on Computational Linguistics,
the organizing body for the COLING conferences. I first
met him at the 1967 Conference, not yet called COLING.
It was an exciting meeting, and a significant part of that
excitement was contributed by his enthusiasm and his
organizational skills. However, equally well conveyed
was his personal charm and his sense of humor.
Throughout his life, he used these traits, coupled of
course with his intellectual competence, in the service not
only of computational linguistics and machine translation,
but of scientific research more generally.

CSNET: ghgonnetvaterloo BITNET: gonnet@watdcs
The abstract must provide sufficient detail to allow the
program committee to assess the merits of the paper.
Late submissions risk rejection without consideration.
Authors will be notified of acceptance or rejection by 15
August 1986. A working draft of the paper, not to exceed
15 pages, for inclusion in the conference proceedings will
be due by 30 September 1986. Conference proceedings
will be available at the conference. It is anticipated that
most of these papers will be reports on continuing
research and that many of them will appear, in more
complete form, in scholarly journals.
Subject to the availability of funding, financial assist-
ance will be provided to speakers.
