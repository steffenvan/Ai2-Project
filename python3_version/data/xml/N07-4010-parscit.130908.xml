<bodyText confidence="0.999743846153846">
We introduce a simple opinion mining
system for analyzing Japanese Weblog re-
views called OMS-J. OMS-J is designed
to provide an intuitive visual GUI of opin-
ion mining graphs for a comparison of
different products of the same type to
help a user make a quick purchase de-
cision. We first use an opinion mining
method using a combination of supervised
(a Naive Bayes Classifier) and unsuper-
vised (an improved SO-PMI: Semantic
Orientation Using Pointwise Mutual In-
formation) learning.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.988289333333333">
Nowadays, there are numerous Web sites containing
personal opinions, e.g. customer reviews of prod-
ucts, forums, discussion groups, and blogs. Here,
we use the term Weblog for these sites. How to ex-
tract and analyze these opinions automatically, i.e.
“Opinion Mining”, has seen increasing attention in
recent years.
This paper presents a simple opinion mining sys-
tem (OMS-J) for analyzing Japanese Weblog re-
views automatically. The novelty of OMS-J is two-
fold: First, it provides a GUI using intuitive visual
mining graphs aimed at inexperienced users who
want to check opinions on the Weblog before pur-
chasing something. These graphs can help the user
to make a quick decision on which product is suit-
able. Secondly, this system combines a supervised
and an unsupervised approach to perform opinion
mining. In related work (Chaovalit, 2005; Tur-
ney, 2002), both supervised and unsupervised ap-
proaches have been shown to have their pros and

cons. Based on the merits of these approaches and
the characteristics of Japanese (Kobayashi, 2003),
we proposed an opinion mining method using a
Naive Bayes Classifier (supervised approach) and an
improved SO-PMI method (unsupervised approach)
to perform different parts of the classification task
(Wang, 2006).
OMS-J implements Weblog opinion mining by
the steps shown in Figure 1. In the next section, we
describe the proposed system in detail.

2.1 Information Search
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999991142857143">
The first step is information search. We used the
Google search engine1 to get all the information on
one product category or one specific product in the
Japanese weblog on the Internet. The search key-
word is the product category name or the product
name. The URL range of the search is restricted by
the URL type (e.g. blog, bbs, review).

2.3 Opinion Mining
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999968606060606">
Opinion mining methods can usually be divided into
two types: supervised and unsupervised approaches.
Supervised approaches are likely to provide more
accurate classification results but need a training cor-
pus. Unsupervised approaches on the other hand re-
quire no training data but tend to produce weaker
results.
We propose a combined opinion mining method
by performing feature classification and P/N classi-
fication (Wang, 2006). The purpose of these classifi-
cations is to know what the opinion expresses about
a certain product’s features. Feature means a prod-
uct’s attribute, i.e. price, design, function or battery
feature. Based on our previous study, it is easy to
create a feature corpus. Therefore feature classifica-
tion is performed by a supervised approach, a Naive
Bayes Classifier. P/N classification classifies repu-
tation expressions into positive or negative meaning
using an unsupervised approach, SO-PMI. The SO-
PMI approach measures the similarity of pairs of
words or phrases based on the mutual information
theory, in our case the closeness of an opinion and
words for ”good” or ”bad”.
No human effort is required when mining a new
product or category. Only inputting the name of the
product or category is needed. It does however re-
quire quite a lot of processing time, since the SO-
PMI approach using a search engine is very time
consuming. Adding new features requires manual
work, since a small hand labeled training corpus is
used. Similar categories of products, for instance
cameras and mp3 players, use the same features
though, so this is not done very often.

2.4 Mining Graphs GUI
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999871272727273">
Finally, OMS-J provides a GUI with mining graphs
showing the opinion mining data in the database, as
shown in Figure 2. These graphs show the distribu-
tion of positive and negative opinions of each feature
type such as ”design”, and for each product. The
distribution of positive opinions among the different
product choices are shown in a pie chart, as is the
same for negative opinions. This GUI can also show
graphs for a single product’s mining results, show-
ing the positive/negative opinion distribution of each
feature.

3 Demonstration
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999006">
During the demonstration, we will show that OMS-
J is an intuitive opinion mining system that can help
people to make a quick decision on purchasing some
product. OMS-J’s trial version has been developed
and tested with three kinds of products: Electronic
Dictionaries, MP3 Players and Notebook PCs. The
experiment results were positive. We will show how
the system works when a user wants to buy a good
MP3 player or wants to get a feel for the general
opinions on a specific Notebook PC etc.
