1 INTRODUCTION

<bodyText confidence="0.9995023125">
MIT Press has given us two new introductory philoso-
phy-of-language books, both of which fall within the
category of &amp;quot;single-author&amp;quot; texts (despite the multiple
authorship of one of them); that is, they are not anthol-
ogies, but presentations of the material from the per-
spective of the author(s). Why would a publisher issue
two such texts in the same year, running the risk of
having each undercut the other? One answer might be
that these books address very different audiences. Mi-
chael Devitt and Kim Sterelny&apos;s Language and Reality
is a scholarly, high-level introduction, while Robert M.
Martin&apos;s The Meaning of Language is an elementary,
somewhat simplified introduction. In what follows, I
shall describe and briefly summarize the two books, and
conclude with some observations and recommenda-
tions.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992263685714285">
According to Devitt and Sterelny, Language and Real-
ity &amp;quot;is an introduction to the philosophy of lan-
guage . . . intended primarily, but not solely, as a
textbook. . . . We make no pretence at neutrality. A
definite theoretical perspective pervades this book&amp;quot; (p.
ix). Of course, all &amp;quot;single&amp;quot;-author texts suffer, albeit
inevitably, from such lack of neutrality (even antholo-
gies do, in the editor&apos;s choice of what to include and
what to exclude), although the less neutral such a book
is, the less it can be considered an introductory text.
Before examining the substance of this book&apos;s per-
spective, I should make some observations on its style:
Each chapter ends with a detailed and helpful biblio-
graphical/historical essay called &amp;quot;Suggested Reading&amp;quot;.
There is also a brief glossary and an index. The writing
style is conversational and somewhat colorful, even
sarcastic at times. For example:
Much of this work [on modal logic] is complex, difficult
and technical. All of it depends to some extent on modern
logic. We shall, therefore, spare you an exposition of
these results. (p. 23.)
We are as enthusiastic for conquest as any causal theorist
could be, but the wise imperialist knows his limitations.
We think that Putnam goes way too far. (p. 75.)
The text is aimed at a wide variety of students from
various disciplines, with harder passages—from as
short as a part of a sentence to as long as an entire
chapter—delimited by the mark **. The placement of
**s is often odd: sometimes the middle of a sentence is
**ed, and there is at least one un**ed sentence whose
pronouns refer back to a **ed sentence! Curiously, the
passage in the Preface that describes the authors&apos; the-
oretical perspective is within **s!
What, then, is their perspective? It consists of four
aspects:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9805438">
1. Naturalism: &amp;quot;The theory of language . . . is an
empirical and conjectural theory like any
other. . . . [P]eople [are] . . . nothing but com-
plex parts of the physical world&amp;quot; (p. x). Thus the
authors are opposed to certain views of Whorf,
Kuhn, Feyerabend, Putnam, Dummett, structur-
alists, and Wittgenstein, but they are not opposed
to Quine (although he is only mentioned, not
discussed).
2. Functionalism: The authors view philosophy of
language as part of cognitive science; they are in
sympathy with certain views of Fodor, Dennett,
Lycan, and Stich.
3. The authors accept some of &amp;quot;the insights of
transformational generative grammar, whilst re-
maining sceptical of its claims about psychological
reality&amp;quot; (p. x).
4. The authors are in favor of causal theories of
reference, as presented by Kripke, Donnellan,
Putnam, and Field.

Semantics and only brief mention of Montague&apos;s con-
tributions.
Part I (&amp;quot;Introduction&amp;quot;) discusses ways in which
philosophy is concerned with language. It discusses the
nature of language for communication and for private
use; it characterizes language as being stimulus-inde-
pendent, abstract, arbitrary, medium-independent, pro-
ductive, and powerful (in the sense of being able to talk
about anything); and it spells out the authors&apos; natural-
ism.
Part II (&amp;quot;Meaning&amp;quot;) begins with a chapter on &amp;quot;Truth
and Reference&amp;quot;, which cites the importance of truth
conditions as &amp;quot;central to explaining meaning&amp;quot; (p. 17).
The authors discuss reference, syntactic structure, and
&amp;quot;decompositionality&amp;quot; as aspects of explaining truth
conditions. There is a **ed section covering speech-act
theory, theories of questions, and Gricean implicature
(all in three pages). Next, they turn to theories of proper
names, as a challenge to the doctrine that word meaning
= reference. They state that they &amp;quot;are attempting to
give a scientific theory of language. There is no place in
science for talk of the non-existent&amp;quot; (p. 27). This stands
in stark contrast with their claim in Part I concerning the
&amp;quot;power&amp;quot; of language. For surely there is a place in
science for talk of nonexistents, perhaps especially in
cognitive science and computational natural-language
understanding, where it is essential to recognize that
people use language to talk about everything and any-
thing, existing or otherwise (including such once scien-
tifically respectable things as phlogiston and such cur-
rently respectable but, for all we now know, nonexisting
things as quarks: cf. Castarieda 1972; Rapaport 1978,
1981, 1985; Routley 1979; Parsons 1980; Maida and
Shapiro 1982; Zalta 1983; Shapiro and Rapaport 1987.)
Although Devitt and Sterelny introduce the notion of
opacity, they decide, unfortunately, that opaque con-
texts &amp;quot;are too hard for more than a passing mention in
this book&amp;quot; (p. 29). Finally, they offer two strategies to
cope with nonreferential roles: the Fregean strategy
introduces senses as new roles for meaning, besides the
referential role; and the strategy of Alexius Meinong
and David Lewis is to extend ontology to include
possible worlds (though the authors are technically
wrong here: Meinong did extend ontology, but to inten-
sional individuals, not to possible worlds: cf. Casta-
iieda, Rapaport, Routley, Parsons, and Zalta, op. cit.).
Chapter 3 (&amp;quot;Description Theories of Reference:
Names&amp;quot;) presents the theory of Frege and Russell,
shows how it handles various problems, and raises
several objections to it. The authors then do the same
for the cluster theory of Wittgenstein, Strawson, and
Searle. Next comes Kripke&apos;s argument against descrip-
tion theories, followed by the authors&apos; claim that &amp;quot;We
think that description theories of names are wrong not
merely in details but in fundamentals&amp;quot; (p. 51). In
Chapter 4 (&amp;quot;A Causal Theory of Reference: Names&amp;quot;),
they present a simplified causal theory a la Kripke, and
show how it has some of the good features of the earlier
(rejected) theories while avoiding some of the bad ones.
They then develop the theory to handle empty names,
existence statements, etc. Chapter 5 (&amp;quot;Theories of
Reference: Other Terms&amp;quot;) extends (and rejects) de-
scription theories and extends (without rejecting) causal
theories to natural-kind terms and artifactual-kind
terms. There is also a section on DonneIlan&apos;s distinction
(although it is **ed, which I find odd, given its impor-
tance).
In Chapter 6, (&amp;quot;Syntactic Structure&amp;quot;), the authors
state that they &amp;quot;are setting aside the findings of the
logicians [about syntactic structure] as too difficult for
this book. . . . In the present chapter, we shall discuss
the findings of the grammarians, in particular, the
revolutionary findings of Noam Chomsky&amp;quot; (p. 89). This
is, then, another major omission, one that—given the
reliance of most philosophers of language on logical
analyses of sentences—is difficult to comprehend in an
allegedly introductory text. Nevertheless, an introduc-
tion to syntactic theory as done by (at least some)
linguists is valuable and important, and that they give.
They discuss phrase-structure trees, the notions of
surface and deep structures, transformations, and such
contemporary transformational theories as generative
semantics, extended standard theory, and trace theory
(but they do not discuss government and binding theory
or, for that matter, such newer grammatical theories as
generalized phrase-structure grammar or the several
functional-unification grammar formalisms).
Part III (&amp;quot;Language and Mind&amp;quot;) begins with a chap-
ter on &amp;quot;Thought and Meaning&amp;quot;, in which thoughts are
identified with propositional attitudes. The authors take
the view that &amp;quot;Thoughts . . . are inner states: beliefs,
desires, hopes, fears, etc. . . . They are inner represen-
tations (and misrepresentations) of the external world;
they have content&amp;quot; (p. 115). Further, thoughts are
&amp;quot;language-like. . . . [They] seem to have the same
semantic properties as sentences of human lan-
guages. . . . [They] have the syntax of sentences&amp;quot; (p.
116), and they are productive and abstract. The authors
consider and reject Chomsky&apos;s and Grice&apos;s objections
to this view, but &amp;quot;seem caught in the following circle:
(a) speaker meaning is explained by thought content; (b)
that content is explained by the meaning of the thought
sentence; (c) that meaning is explained by conventional
meaning; and (d) conventional meaning is explained by
speaker meaning&amp;quot; (p. 124). They extricate themselves
from the circle by patching up Grice&apos;s theory.
Chapter 8 (&amp;quot;Linguistic Competence&amp;quot;) explains that
syntax is a formal theory of symbols and that compe-
tence is a theory about human minds. This poses a
problem for Chomskian linguistics, which claims that
linguistics is supposed to be the study of both. The
authors, however, &amp;quot;think that linguistic theories are not
mostly about competence. By taking their theories to be
about competence instead of symbols, the grammarians
turn possibly true theories into almost certainly false
ones&amp;quot; (p. 134). There is a nice philosophical analysis of
Computational Linguistics, Volume 14, Number 3, September 1988 109
Book Reviews The Meaning of Language
the notion of &amp;quot;following a rule&amp;quot; and an application of
this analysis to the &amp;quot;grammarians&amp;quot; problem. This
involves a discussion of what Devitt and Sterelny call
the propositional assumption: a competent speaker of
English is not competent in virtue of knowing pro posi-
tionally the grammar of English. They relate this as-
sumption to Fodor&apos;s theory of modularity, and then
present reasons for doubting that a competent speaker
of English is competent in virtue of actually following a
grammar of English. Their conclusion is that &amp;quot;compe-
tence in a language . . . is a set of skills or abili-
ties. . . . It consists in the speaker being able to do
things with a language&amp;quot; (p. 148). The chapter ends with
discussions of Chomsky and Fodor on innateness.
Chomsky&apos;s theory is interpreted in three ways: The
&amp;quot;boring&amp;quot; interpretation is that &amp;quot;human beings are in-
nately predisposed to learn languages&amp;quot; (p. 150); the
&amp;quot;interesting&amp;quot; interpretation is that &amp;quot;humans have an
innate, richly structured, language-specific, learning
device, and this device determines that the grammar of
any language that a human can learn conforms to the
universal grammar&amp;quot; (pp. 150-151); and finally, the
&amp;quot;very exciting&amp;quot; interpretation is that &amp;quot;the innate lan-
guage-acquisition device consists in propositional
knowledge of universal grammar&amp;quot; (p. 151). They con-
clude &amp;quot;that it is plausible to think that there is an innate
language-acquisition device, but are not convinced that
this device embodies a universal grammar. We reject
the view that speakers have innate knowledge of uni-
versal grammar or of anything else about their lan-
guage&amp;quot; (p. 154).
All of Chapter 9 (&amp;quot;Truth and Explanation&amp;quot;) is **ed.
The authors ask, &amp;quot;Do we really need truth to explain
meaning?&amp;quot; (p. 161). Their line of argument is that we
do, because linguistics is not part of psychology; its task
is to explain linguistic symbols, which are the products
of behavior, and &amp;quot;truth is needed to explain the sym-
bols&amp;quot; (p. 162).
Chapter 10 (&amp;quot;Linguistic Relativity&amp;quot;) presents and
critiques Whorf s arguments, and discusses Kuhn, Fe-
yerabend, and the notion of incommensurability of
scientific theories and scientific terms. Curiously, there
is no mention of the work of Kay and Berlin on
linguistic relativity. (An excellent discussion of this
work, as well as that of Whorf, may be found in Lakoff
1987.)
Part IV (&amp;quot;Language and Realism&amp;quot;) is a more purely
philosophical defense of realism: &amp;quot;Physical entities. . .
exist . . . [and] do not depend for their existence or
nature on our minds, nor on our awareness, perception
or cognizance of them&amp;quot; (p. 187). Chapter 11 (&amp;quot;Verdi-
cationism&amp;quot;) discusses the verification theory of mean-
ing, but doesn&apos;t given any of the strong arguments
against it or even a reference to Church&apos;s refutation of
it (Church 1949; cf. Ashby 1967). The chapter concludes
with a detailed examination of a new form of veri-
ficationism due to Michael Dummett. Chapter 12
(&amp;quot;Neo-Kantianism&amp;quot;) briefly sketches Kant&apos;s theory of
mind-dependent appearances (phenomena) and mind-
independent things-in-themselves (noumena). It shows
how Whorf s, Kuhn&apos;s, Feyerabend&apos;s, and even Put-
nam&apos;s theories are Kantian, and it rejects such neo-
Kantiartism. Chapter 13 (&amp;quot;Structuralism&amp;quot;) contains a
nice discussion of de Saussure&apos;s theory and criticizes
structuralists&apos; rejections of reference and of realism. In
this reviewer&apos;s opinion, however, many of the features
of de Saussurean structuralism—internal relations, ho-
lism, and autonomy—are central to computational the-
ories of natural-language understanding (cf. Rapaport
1987).
The fifth and final Part of the book is on &amp;quot;Language
and Philosophy&amp;quot;. Chapter 14 (&amp;quot;First Philosophy&amp;quot;)
views philosophy in a Quinean fashion as &amp;quot;continuous
with science&amp;quot; (p. 225). It presents the problem of
universals versus particulars as a &amp;quot;pseudoproblem&amp;quot; (p.
228) and an &amp;quot;example of a bad theory of language
leading to a bad theory of the world&amp;quot; (p. 229). The
authors reject the ordinary-language school of philoso-
phy as well as rejecting conceptual analysis as a way of
doing philosophy: &amp;quot;The study of language, and the
concepts it expresses, is important but it should not be
identified with philosophy or even made central to it.
The linguistic turn is a mistake and does not re-establish
first philosophy&amp;quot; (p. 234). Finally, Chapter 15 is a **ed
chapter on &amp;quot;Rational Psychology&amp;quot;, in which the au-
thors discuss and reject Dennett&apos;s intentional-stance
theory and Davidson&apos;s anomalous monism.

3 THE MEANING OF LANGUAGE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998040884615385">
Robert Martin&apos;s book &amp;quot;is written for newcomers and
presupposes absolutely no background in philosophy of
language, or in philosophy in general. My aim is to
provide a comprehensible and reasonably thorough
introduction to the field&amp;quot; (p. 1). Thus the intended
audience is less sophisticated than that of Devitt and
Sterelny&apos;s book. Unlike those authors&apos; ** strategy, and
like a good textbook, the indication of which chapters
can be skipped, which are independent of others, and
which are dependent upon others is in the introduction.
There are annotated suggested readings at the ends of
chapters, and there is an index. Although the style of
writing is plain and not as pretentious as Devitt and
Sterelny&apos;s, Martin can be equally &amp;quot;down to earth&amp;quot; at
times: after quoting Berkeley as saying, &amp;quot;All of which
seems very plain and not to include any difficulty in it&amp;quot;,
Martin observes, &amp;quot;Beware when philosophers say
things like that last sentence!&amp;quot; (p. 24). As with the other
book under review, there is no discussion of situation
semantics or Montague grammar.
The book is divided into two parts. The first, &amp;quot;Lan-
guage and Minds&amp;quot; is &amp;quot;about what language is for&amp;quot; (p.
2). It begins with a chapter on &amp;quot;The Structure of
Language&amp;quot;, which discusses infinity and novelty as two
features of language. Phrase-structure grammar is pre-
sented, quite nicely, as a way to explain these features,

and there is an excellent discussion of recursive rules.
There is an elementary discussion of surface and deep
structure, with a mention of transformation rules, but
only an overly simple example for an artificial language,
the sole purpose of which is to highlight the distinction
between syntax and semantics: &amp;quot;The rest of this book
deals in one way or another with what this thing called
meaning might be&amp;quot; (p. 17). I find this order of introduc-
ing linguistic facts before philosophizing about them
quite pedagogically congenial.
Chapter 2 (&amp;quot;Meanings as Ideas&amp;quot;) begins by setting
up the distinction between speaker&apos;s meaning and sen-
tence meaning. The &amp;quot;idea theory of meaning&amp;quot; (viz.,
&amp;quot;words express the speaker&apos;s thoughts&amp;quot;; p. 20), is
given as an example of speaker&apos;s meaning, and an
argument against it, based only on word (and not
sentence) meanings, is given.
Chapter 3 (&amp;quot;Innateness&amp;quot;) is an optional chapter, but
it is not clear why it follows Chapter 2). It presents a
sketch of Chomsky&apos;s arguments for innateness, fol-
lowed by several replies. But whose replies are they?
Martin provides no key to the literature. This is a
general problem with many single-author texts and is a
specific failure of this one. There is, however, a refer-
enced discussion of Fodor&apos;s theories about the language
of thought, viewed as an &amp;quot;extension of the innateness
hypothesis&amp;quot; (p. 32). Chapter 4, a nonoptional chapter
with the uninformative title, &amp;quot;Going on in the Same
Way&amp;quot;, depends on the discussion in the optional Chap-
ter 3! It discusses inferring general rules from finite
samples, and it discusses the grue/bleen paradox.
Chapter 5 is on &amp;quot;The Private Language Argument&amp;quot;,
presented as an argument against the notion of speak-
er&apos;s meaning. Chapter 6 (&amp;quot;Radical Translation&amp;quot;) dis-
cusses Quine&apos;s theories of radical translation, holism,
and the analytic/synthetic distinction, relating the radi-
cal-translation argument to Whorf s arguments. Chapter
7 (&amp;quot;Are Rules Central to Language?&amp;quot;) is optional. It
examines arguments of Quine, Ziff, and Searle on the
issues of the nature of rules and rule-following, and
whether they are important for understanding language.
Chapter 8 (&amp;quot;Conventions&amp;quot;) discusses David Lewis&apos;s
theory of convention as an explanation of &amp;quot;what sort of
social arrangement the existence of natural languages
actually represents&amp;quot; (p. 77). Chapter 9 (&amp;quot;Speech Acts&amp;quot;)
discusses Grice&apos;s theory of speaker&apos;s meaning and
shows how to modify it to handle sentence meaning.
The notions of speaker&apos;s meaning and privacy are
related to Whorf&apos;s arguments.
Chapter 10 (&amp;quot;Animal and Machine Language&amp;quot;) is
optional. It contains a rather sketchy overview of some
of the issues involved in the controversy over whether
chimps can be taught language. There is also a discus-
sion of the problem of other minds and whether animals
and machines that exhibit (some of) the same behavior
as humans &amp;quot;can be counted as having a mental life&amp;quot; (p.
102). This chapter also contains a brief introduction to
propositional attitudes and a very brief discussion of
whether animals or machines can have them.
Part II is titled &amp;quot;Language and Things&amp;quot; and is about
&amp;quot;the connection between bits of language and the bits of
the world each is about&amp;quot; (p. 2). It begins, in Chapter 11
(&amp;quot;Function and Object&amp;quot;), with an investigation of &amp;quot;the
connection between words (and sentences) and things,
leaving out the detour through ideas&amp;quot; (p. 111). Martin
&amp;quot;call[s] &apos;the father of&apos; an object —&gt; object function,
abbreviated o —&gt; o, . . . [which] means that &apos;the father
of&apos; takes an object as argument and yields an object
as value. (An object is abbreviated by or (p. 113). This
is curious, since I would have thought that &apos;the father
of&apos; would be an NP —&gt; NP function. In any event,
Martin then does something that I heartily disap-
prove of, especially in (what is merely) an introductory
text:
The notation I use in this chapter, the following notation
for functions, and the trees analyzing sentences (intro-
duced in what follows) are not standard logical notation.
I use them because I think they are easily learned and
clearly represent the structural features they analyze and
are in these ways superior to standard notation. For
readers already familiar with standard logical notation,
however, I sometimes, when things get a bit more com-
plicated, give the equivalent standard logical notation. If
you are not familiar with modern symbolic logic, you can
safely ignore these. (p. 113)
But why introduce nonstandard notation, especially if it
has to be given up &amp;quot;when things get a bit more compli-
cated&amp;quot;, if you are not trying to show that it clarifies
some issue in a new way? It certainly won&apos;t help the
reader follow the discipline in the standard literature.
What&apos;s even more curious is that the &amp;quot;nonstandard
notation&amp;quot; is akin to that of categorial grammar, but with
no mention of that fact or even a reference to any of the
literature on it!
Predicates are analyzed as o —&gt; v (where v is a truth
value; an analysis attributed to Frege); adverbs are
treated as (o v) —&gt; (o —&gt; v); and, for conjunctions of
predicates, and is analyzed as (o —&gt; v)—&gt; [(o —&gt; v)—&gt; (o
—&gt; v)]. For example, Fred is a fat professor is analyzed
as in Figure 1.
This analysis is continued in Chapter 12 (&amp;quot;Quanti-
fiers&amp;quot;): quantifiers are treated as (o —&gt; v) —&gt; v, or is
treated like and, the not of predicate negation as (o—&gt; v)
—&gt; (o —&gt; v), and the it is not the case that of sentence
negation as v —&gt; v.
In Chapter 13 (&amp;quot;Definite Descriptions&amp;quot;), Martin dis-
cusses the problem of nonreferring definite descrip-
tions: what to do about the daughter of Igor if Igor has
no daughter. He gives Frege&apos;s answer (take the output
of the function to be the null set), and discusses its
notorious difficulties for natural-language semantics.
He then turns to Russell&apos;s analysis in terms of existence
and uniqueness conditions, and gives Donnellan&apos;s the-
ory as an argument against Russell. (Note that one
book&apos;s **ed section is another&apos;s nonoptional one.) This

is followed by a brief discussion of Searle&apos;s theory of
truth-value gaps.
Chapter 14 (&amp;quot;Extensionality&amp;quot;) contains a clear pre-
sentation of the differences between extensional and
nonextensional contexts. But the discussion of the latter
is odd. Here is the example of a nonextensional context
that Martin uses to show that the referent of a sentence
is not its truth value:
Fred went to the store and then
Filling the blank with
He went home.
and
He woke up that morning.
—both assumed to be true—yield, respectively, a truth
and a falsehood. But surely that is a highly nonstandard
example of a nonextensional context! The chapter ends
with the introduction of states of affairs as referents of
sentences, in order to preserve the extensional theory of
meaning.
In Chapter 15 (&amp;quot;Modal Contexts and Possible
Worlds&amp;quot;), Martin shows why modal contexts are non-
extensional, and he discusses and rejects (on grounds
having to do with the analytic/synthetic distinction)
quotational interpretations of modal contexts as a way
of making them extensional. This is followed by discus-
sions of the use of possible worlds for giving semantics
for the modalities and of rigid designators. Chapter 18
(&amp;quot;Psychological Contexts&amp;quot;), which might better follow
Chapter 15, discusses propositional attitudes in connec-
tion with extensionality and possible worlds.
Chapter 16 (&amp;quot;Proper Names&amp;quot;) introduces Russell&apos;s
theory of names as disguised definite descriptions and
Kripke&apos;s theory that names are rigid designators. There
is also a version of Putnam&apos;s twin-Earth example,
although Martin offers it as an argument against Russell.
Chapter 17 continues the examination of proper names
and definite descriptions, introducing the causal theory
of proper names.
Cha pl.er 19 (&amp;quot;Sense and Reference&amp;quot;) introduces
Frege&apos;s theory of senses as a way of resolving issues
about nonreferring names and nonextensional contexts.
Martin objects to senses on the following grounds:
&amp;quot;senses are subjective . . . perhaps private and vary
from individual to individual&amp;quot; (p. 184). But this con-
fuses Frege&apos;s notion of &amp;quot;idea&amp;quot; with that of &amp;quot;sense&amp;quot;;
what Martin says is simply not true of Frege&apos;s senses
(Frege 1892, 1960: 59-60). The chapter also presents a
theory, without senses and internal representations,
that purports to account for nonextensional contexts
by, roughly, treating them as de re (although that term
is not used).
Chapter 20 discusses indexicals, proper names, and
propositional attitudes. Indexicals are analyzed in Mar-
tin&apos;s categorial theory as o o. There is even a
discussion of Hector-Neri Castaiieda&apos;s theory of quasi-
indicators, although they are not called that, nor is there
any reference to Castafieda&apos;s writings (e.g., Castatieda
1967, 1968).
Chapter 21 (&amp;quot;General Terms&amp;quot;) covers descriptivism,
accidental and essential properties, proper names, nat-
ural kinds, and &amp;quot;unnatural&amp;quot; kinds. The book ends with
two optional chapters on &amp;quot;Truth and Meaning&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;The
Boundaries of Meaning&amp;quot;. The first discusses Davidson&apos;s
truth-conditional theory of meaning and briefly com-
pares Davidson and Quine. The other looks at &amp;quot;[Wow
language functions in nonliteral ways&amp;quot; (p. 217), cover-
ing Grice&apos;s theory of implicature, metaphor (Grice,
Searle, and Davidson—but not Lakoff and Johnson),
and further discussion of Searle&apos;s and Davidson&apos;s views.

4 CONCLUSIONS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999978136363637">
The two books under review are very different: Devitt
and Sterelny&apos;s is more accurate and scholarly in its
references to the literature, far richer, and philosophi-
cally sophisticated and original. The tone of their book
is not suitable for a novice, although it could be read
profitably by someone already familiar with the issues
and controversies and who is looking for an overview.
In contrast, Martin&apos;s book is more textbookish. It
would be suitable at most for a novice—it&apos;s clearly
written and easy to read, but it is inaccurate and
oversimplified in spots.
For a typical reader of this journal wishing to learn
some philosophy of language and having only these two
texts to choose from, Devitt and Sterelny&apos;s would be
the clear choice, as long as their theoretical stance is
kept firmly in mind and not taken for granted. Far better
would be not to rely solely on their book, but to use it
as a guide to the primary sources.
However, a single-author text can be preferable for
undergraduate students, who, being used to such texts,
might have difficulties reading anthologies, in which
there are abrupt shifts in style and level of clarity, and

even inconsistencies(!), among the different authors.
Anthologies, in a discipline such as philosophy of
language, are better in that they (usually) contain pri-
mary sources. My own preference when teaching phi-
losophy of language is not to use a single-author text
(except at most to supplement the primary sources and
to serve as a guide to the problems and the literature, for
the student who prefers such a guide). Rather, I have
the students read original sources, while I provide back-
ground, connecting material, and explications in lectures.
To sum up, as a &amp;quot;single&amp;quot;-author text, Devitt and
Sterelny&apos;s book is probably better than Martin&apos;s, but
the appropriate audience for it (advanced undergradu-
ates at the very least, graduate students (or beyond) at
best) could do as well with an anthology. It would
certainly serve as an excellent, if somewhat idiosyn-
cratic, supplement to an anthology. Martin&apos;s book
would be better for (primarily undergraduate) students
who need the security of a single-author text, but the
instructor would need to correct the errors along the
way. It could, in any case, be usefully supplemented by
an anthology of primary sources.

Natural Language Generation is a collection of papers
that were presented at the Third International Work-
shop on Natural Language Generation in Nijmegen, The
Netherlands, on August 19-23, 1986. Instead of a soft-
cover proceedings, the workshop contents are captured
in this hardcover book containing edited versions of the
papers. The contributions are from computational lin-
guistics, linguistics, and psychology. In the preface,
Kempen, the editor, states that the interactions among
workshop participants demonstrated how much these
different disciplines share. Unfortunately, the interac-
tions do not appear to be reflected in the edited versions
of the papers, even though they might have been of
interest to non-attendees.
Language generation research has been viewed as
the poorer cousin of work on language understanding.
This has been true of computational work as well as
psychological research. People sometimes claim that
until computers have something to talk about, language
generation is not worth studying. Or, they assert that
language understanding is much &apos;harder&apos;, so is more
deserving of attention. This book presents the work of
researchers who have ignored such pronouncements,

It shows how Whorf s, Kuhn&apos;s, Feyerabend&apos;s, and even Putnam&apos;s theories are Kantian, and it rejects such neoKantiartism. Chapter 13 (&amp;quot;Structuralism&amp;quot;) contains a nice discussion of de Saussure&apos;s theory and criticizes structuralists&apos; rejections of reference and of realism. In this reviewer&apos;s opinion, however, many of the features of de Saussurean structuralism—internal relations, holism, and autonomy—are central to computational theories of natural-language understanding (cf. Rapaport 1987). The fifth and final Part of the book is on &amp;quot;Language and Philosophy&amp;quot;. Chapter 14 (&amp;quot;First Philosophy&amp;quot;) views philosophy in a Quinean fashion as &amp;quot;continuous with science&amp;quot; (p. 225). It presents the problem of universals versus particulars as a &amp;quot;pseudoproblem&amp;quot; (p. 228) and an &amp;quot;example of a bad theory of language leading to a bad theory of the world&amp;quot; (p. 229). The authors reject the ordinary-language school of philosophy as well as rejecting conceptual analysis as a way of doing philosophy: &amp;quot;The study of language, and the concepts it expresses, is important but it should not be identified with ph</context>

This stands in stark contrast with their claim in Part I concerning the &amp;quot;power&amp;quot; of language. For surely there is a place in science for talk of nonexistents, perhaps especially in cognitive science and computational natural-language understanding, where it is essential to recognize that people use language to talk about everything and anything, existing or otherwise (including such once scientifically respectable things as phlogiston and such currently respectable but, for all we now know, nonexisting things as quarks: cf.

Although Devitt and Sterelny introduce the notion of opacity, they decide, unfortunately, that opaque contexts &amp;quot;are too hard for more than a passing mention in this book&amp;quot; (p. 29). Finally, they offer two strategies to cope with nonreferential roles: the Fregean strategy introduces senses as new roles for meaning, besides the referential role; and the strategy of Alexius Meinong and David Lewis is to extend ontology to include possible worlds (though the authors are technically wrong here: Meinong did extend ontolog</context>
