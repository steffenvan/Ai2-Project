ABSTRACT
</email>
<bodyText confidence="0.943591239130435">
The topic of the paper is the intro-
duction of a formalism that permits a
homogeneous representation of definite
temporal adverbials, temporal quanti-
fications (as frequency and duration),
temporal conjunctions and tenses, and
of their combinations with propositions.
This unified representation renders it
possible to show how these components
refer to each other and interact in
creating temporal meanings. The formal
representation is based on the notions
&amp;quot;phase-set&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;phase-operator&amp;quot;, and it
involves an interval logic. Furthermore
logical connections are used, but the
(always troublesome) logical quantifica-
tions may be avoided. The expressions
are rather near to linguistic struc-
tures, which facilitates the link to
text analysis. Some emprical confir-
mations are outlined.
1. THE GENERAL FRAME
This paper presents some results
that have been obtained in the field
of time and tense-phenomena (Kunze 1987).
In connection with this some links to
text analysis, knowledge representation
and inference mechanisms have been
taken into account.
The formalism presented here differs
from what is under label of temporal
logic on the market (e. g. Prior (1967),
Aqvist/Guenthner (1978). Our main in-
tention is to establish a calculus that
is rather near to linguistic structures
on one side (for text analysis) and to
inference mechanisms on the other
side.
The whole formalism has integrating
features, i. e. the following compo-
nents are represented by the same for-
mal means in a way, that it becomes
easy and effective to refer the differ-
ent components to each other:
- The propositions and their validity
with respect to time;
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.993048375">
- Definite temporal adverbials (next
week, every Tuesday);
- Definite temporal quantifications as
frequency (three times) and duration
(three hours), comparision of fre-
quencies, durations etc.;
- Temporal conjunctions;
- Tenses and their different meanings.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.930188">
The unified representation renders
it possible to observe how the compo-
nents interact in creating temporal
meanings and relations. Some details
have to be left out here, e. g. the
notion &amp;quot;determined time&amp;quot; and the axio-
matic basis of the calculus.

2. PHASE-SETS AND PROPOSITIONS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998246230769231">
A phase p is an interval (either un-
bounded or a span or a moment) which a
truth value (denoted by q(p)) is as-
signed to:
q(p) T : p is considered as an affir-
mative phase.
q(p) = F p is considered as a denying
phase.
The intervals are subsets of the time
axis U (and never empty!).
A phase-set P is a pair
where P* is a set of intervals, and q
(the evaluation function) assigns a
truth value to each pe P*. P has to ful-
fil the following consistency demand:
(A) For all p&apos;,p&amp;quot; e. P&apos; holds:
If p&apos;n p&amp;quot; 4 0, then q(p&apos;) = q(p&amp;quot;).
A phase-set P is called complete, iff
the union of all phases of P covers U.
Propositions R are replaced by com-
plete phase-sets that express the
&amp;quot;structured&amp;quot; validity of R on the time
axis U. Such a phase-set, denoted by
CR&gt;, has to be understood as a possible
temporal perspective of R. There are
propositions that differ from each
other in this perspective only: For
(1) John sleeps in the dining room.
one has several such perspectives: He
is sleeping there, he sleeps there be-
cause the bedroom is painted (for some
days), he sleeps always there. SO the
phases of CR&gt; are quite different, even
with clear syntactic consequences for
the underlying verb: The local adver-
bial may not be omitted in the second
and third case!&apos;
I skip here completely the following
problems:

3. PHASE-OPERATORS
• A phase-operator is a mapping with
phase-sets as arguments and values.
There are phase-operators with one and
with two arguments. A two-place phase-
operator P-0(P1,P2) is characterized by
the following properties:
(B) If P = P-0(P1&apos;P2)&apos; then P* = P*
1&apos;

e. the -set of intervals of the
resulting phase-set is the same as

<bodyText confidence="0.859324333333333">
of the first argument;
(C) For each phase-operator there is a
characteristic condition that says
how q(p) is defined by q1(p) and
P2 for all p6P*. This condition
implies always that q(p) = F fol-
lows from q1(p) = F.
So the effect of applying P-0(131,P2)

truth value, new phases are not created
The characteristic conditions are
based on two-place relations between
intervals. Let rel( , ) be such a rela-
tion. Then we define (by means of rel)
q(p) according to the following scheme:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.958234">
T, if q1(p) = T and there
a P26 11 with q2(132)
q(p) = and rel(p2,p);
F otherwise
- 198 -
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999979333333333">
We will use three phase-operators and
define their evaluation functions in the
following way by (D):
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.894960428571429">
(E) P = OCC(P1,P2):
rel(P21P) is the relation
&amp;quot;p2 and p overlap&amp;quot;, i. e. p2np 0.
(F) P = PER(P1,P2):
rel(P2,P) is the relation
&amp;quot;p2 contains p&amp;quot;, i. e. p2 p.
(G) P = NEX(131,P2):
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.981861">
rel(P2,p) is the relation
&amp;quot;p2 and p are not seperated from
each other&amp;quot;, i. e. p2up is an
interval.
As an illustration we consider some
examples. Needless to say, that their
exact represention requires further
formal equipment we have not introduced
yet. Typical cases for OCC and PER are:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.705047833333333">
(2) Yesterday was bad weather.
Overlapping of (yesterday) and a T-
phase of &lt;bad weather).
(3) John worked the whole evening.
A T-phase of (22m1A0 is contained
in a T-phase of (John works).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.933432130434783">
(for (evening), (yesterday&gt; cf. 7.)
There is only a slight difference be-
tween the characteristic conditions for
OCC and NEX: NEX admits additionally
only MEETS(p2,p) and MEETS(p,p2) in the
sense of Allen (1984). Later T will mo-
tivate that NEX is the appropriate
phase-operator for the conjunction when.
Therefore, sentences of the form
(4) R1, when R2. (cf. (N), (0))
will be represented by an expression
that contains NEXC&lt;R2), (R1&gt;) as core.
The interpretation is that nothing hap-
pens between a certain T-phase of (R1)
and a certain T-phase of &lt;R2&gt; (if they
do not overlap).
The next operation we are going to
define is a one-place phase-operator
with indeterminate character. It may be
called &amp;quot;choice&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;singling out&amp;quot; and
will be denoted by xPl, where P1 =
is again an arbitrary phase-set:
(H) xPi =

<equation confidence="0.9942602">
P* = 10* (set of intervals unchanged)
1
{ T for exactly one p with
q(p) = T (if there is some
q(p) = T-phase in P1):
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9833174">
If we need different choices, we write
xP1&apos; yP1&apos; zP2&apos; ..., using the first sign
as an index in the mathematical sense.
Moreover, ve define one-place phase-
operators with parameters:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.7694872">
(1) KAR(Pi,n) = DA,01
FIE = p,1 (set of intervals unchanged)
T, if q1(p) = T and there are
exactly n T-phases in
(1(P) =
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.997270714285714">
F otherwise (for all p
independently of qi(p))
Similarily one defines ORD(Pi,g) for
integers g: ORD(Pi,g) assigns the value
T exactly to the g-th T-phase of Pl, if
there is one, with certain arrangements
for g (e. g. how to express &amp;quot;the last
but second&amp;quot; etc.)
Finally we define the &amp;quot;alternation&amp;quot;
alt(Pi) of an arbitrary phase-set P1 =
(II,q13. By alternation new phases may
be created: alt(Pi) contains exactly
those phases which one gets by joining
all phases of P1 that are not seperated

from each other and have the same value
1:11(p1). So the intervals of alt(Pi) are
unions of intervals of P1&apos; the q-values
are the common q1-values of their parts
(cf. (A)). It is always alt(alt(Pi)) =
alt(111), and alt(Pi) is complete, if
P1 is complete. Going from left to
right on the time axis U, one has an
alternating succession of phases in
alt(Pi) with respect to the q-values.
alt(Pi) is the &amp;quot;maximal levelling&amp;quot; of
the phase-set Pl.

4. LOGICAL CONNECTIONS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.818676666666667">
The negation of a phase-set P1 is de-
fined as follows:
(J) ^&amp;quot;Pi = [P1,q1:

Note that (^•R&gt; and -&apos;(R&gt; may be dif-
ferent because of non-equivalent phase-
perspectives for -,11 and R!
For each two-place functor &amp;quot;a&amp;quot; (e.
g. &amp;quot;CI&amp;quot; MI &amp;quot;v&amp;quot;) we define P1 a P2, if
the sets P1 and P2 are equal:
(K) P1 a P2 = [P*,q):
P8 n P* nP*
1 2
q(p) = e(cl1(p),q2(p)), where F° is
the corresponding truth func-
tion (e. g. vel for &amp;quot; Y&amp;quot;).
Obviously for every phase-operator P-0

<bodyText confidence="0.716637">
the expression P-0(P1,P2) or. P1 repre-
sents both a phase-set and a clear &amp;quot;tau-
tology&amp;quot; - in other words - a phase-set
that is &amp;quot;always true&amp;quot;, if P1 is complete.
Therefore, alt(P-0(171,P2) P1) U°
(where U° is the phase-set that contains
the time axis U as the only interval
with the q-value T) reflects the double
nature of the aforesaid implication.

5. TRUTH CONDITIONS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99548325">
The last considerations lead imme-
deately to the following definitions.
The whole formalism requires two types
of truth conditions, namely
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.6255995">
(L) alt(P) = U°
(M) alt(P) * ^,U° .
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998262285714286">
They have different status: (L) is
used, if the phase-set P is considered
as a temporal representation of some-
thing that is valid, independently of
time. (M) is applied,if P is considered
as something that represents a certain
&amp;quot;time&amp;quot; (expressed by the phases of P).
Because of the second possibility, alt
appears not only in truth conditions,
but it may constitute arguments in
phase-operators etc., too. This will be
shown in the examples below.
Obviously one has for arbitrary
phase-sets P = 113*,q3:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.99764">
alt(P) = U° iff dtaU3pe P*
(q(p) ai T &amp; tap)
alt(P) * iff 3t eU 3p sP*
(q(p) T &amp; t a p)

6. SOME COMMENT ON THE FORMALISM
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.984528159090909">
By regarding the time axis U as a
basic notion one has to take the
trouble to consider the topology of U,
and gets difficulties with closed and
- 200 -
and open sets, environments etc.. This
may be avoided by taking an axiomatic
viewpoint: For all operations, relations
etc. one formulates the essential prop-
erties needed and uses them without di-
rect connection to the time axis. In
this way U becomes a part of a model
of the whole formalism. This is inde-
pendent of the fact, that in definitions
and explanations U may appear for mak-
ing clear what is meant.
7. TEMPORAL ADVERBI ALS
In section 2. we have outlined, how
propositions R are substituted by phase-
sets (II&gt;. The same has to be done for
temporal adverbials. First we consider
definite adverbials: (tuesday&gt; is a
phase-set P, where Pm is the set of all
days (as spans p covering together the
whole time axis U), and exactly the
Tuesdays have the value q(p) = T. For
(&gt; the set 10 is the same, but it
is q(p) = T for all p G Pm. (evening)
has as intervals suitable subintervals
of the days with q(p) = T, whereas the
remaining parts of the days form phases
with q(p) = F in (evening) Analo-
gously (year&gt; contains all years as
spans p with q(p) = T, whereas 41986)
has the same spans, but exactly one
with q(p) = T.
Now we combine temporal adverbials
with propositions. An exact representa-
tion would require that we list all
possible structures of phrases, clauses
etc. that express a certain combination.
We use instead of this &amp;quot;standard para-
phrases&amp;quot; as &amp;quot;at least on Tuesdays R&amp;quot;. If
R is a certain proposition, e. g.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.69932275">

set defined by an alt-operation. This
phase-set has as T-phases exactly those
maximal periods during which (8) holds.
,PER((mar),...) selects the years that
are covered by such a period, and the
whole expression says that 1986 is such
a year (and nothing about other years). &apos;
The time of speech L is formally rep-
resented by a phase-set L° with three
phases, namely L itself with q(L) = T,
and the two remaining infinite inter-
vals with the q-value F. Then one may

(there are three T-phases of (R) in this

are different. The expression in (12)
may appear as an argument in other ex-
pressions again.

day the value T iff the T-phases of (R)
on this day have been preserved. There-
fore, occ(...,...) is a T-F-distribu-
tion over all days if x runs over all

that all T-days are Tuesdays.

As one can see, the expressions ren-
der it possible to formulate even rath-
er complex temporal relations in a com-
prehensible manner without much redun-
dancy, the necessary arguments appear
only once (or twice for certain quanti-
fications as e. g. (puesday) and (AM)
in .(8)). In order to handle durations,
one needs another phase-operator EXT
that is quite similar to KAR and ORD.
The argument R stands either for &amp;quot;bare&amp;quot;
propositions (without any temporal com-
ponent) or for propositions with some
temporal components. In the latter case
the corresponding expression has to be
substituted for &lt;It&gt;:
(16) Every Tuesday John watches tele-
vision in the evening.
Take (R&gt; = (in the evening R&apos;)
with R&apos; = John watches television.
Then one can represent (10 by
(R) = 00C( (R&apos;), (evening))
with alt(...) ^#1.1° (John&apos;s t.v.-
phases in evenings) and apply (8):
(tuesUy)
OCC(Q.11V,00C((R&apos;), (evening)))
alt(...) = U°
Similarily one obtains (10) from (8). .
The truth condition in (8) causes that
alt(...) occurs as argument in (10).
The sign &amp;quot;=&amp;quot; in the examples means that
the left side is defined by the right
side, the left side is stripped of one
(or mare) temporal components. In this
sense (6), (8) and (9) are rules, (7)
and (10) include two rules in each case
The full and exact form of such rules
requires more than the standard para-
phrases, namely corresponding (syntac-
tic) structures on their lett side.

8. TENSES
Till now nothing has been said about
tenses. It is indeed possible to repre-
sent tenses in the formalism that we
have outlined. But it is impossible to
introduce &amp;quot;universal&amp;quot; rules for tenses.
Even between closely related languages
like English and German there are essen-
tial differences. So it does not make
sense to explain here the details for
the German tenses (cf. Kunze 1987).
The main points in describing tenses
are these: At first one needs a dis-
tinction between &amp;quot;tense meanings&amp;quot; and
&amp;quot;tense forms&amp;quot; (e. g. a Present-Perfect-
form may be used as Future Perfect).
After that one has to introduce special
conditions for special tense meanings
(e. g. for perfect tenses in German and
English, for the aorist in other lan-
guages). Further a characterization of
tense meanings by a scheme like Reichen-
bach&apos;s is necessary, including the in-
troduction of the time of speech L°.
On this basis rules for tense-assign-
ment may be formulated expressing which
tenses (. meanings) a phase xP or a
phase-set P can be assigned to. From
the formal point of view tenses then
look like very general adverbials, and
it is rather easy to explain how tenses
and adverbials fit together. Tense-
assignments create new expressions in
addition to those used above. It is im-
portant that the position of the phases
of (R) does not depend on the tense R
is used with: The tense selects some of
these phases by phase-operators. So
alt(NEX(xP,e)) * -de is the basic con-
dition for the actual Present (cf. (G)).

9. TEMPORAL CONJUNCTIONS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.872025833333333">
For some temporal conjunctions there
are two basic variants, the &amp;quot;particular&amp;quot;
usage and the &amp;quot;iterative&amp;quot; usage. We il-
lustrate this phenomenon for when:
(N) wheni (particular usage of when):
WHEN1(R1,R2): (for &amp;quot;R., when
c
alt(NEX((R2&gt;,(111))) * ^1U0.
(17) When John went to the library,
he found 10 $. (Once. when )
In (17) there is a reference to a single
T-phase of (R1&gt; and a single T-phase of
(R2). One can show that the truth con-
dition for wheni is equivalent to
3x 3y(alt(NEX(x(R2),y(111))) * —0)
but this form is avoidable (cf. (H)
and the end of 5.).

he took the bus. (Whenever )
In (18) something is said about all
T-phases of (112), namely
V x 3y(alt(NEX(x(R2) ) * ^-11°) ,
which is equivalent to the truth condi-
tion for when
Conjunctions like while, as long as
etc. are represented in a similar way
with the phase-operator PER (cf. (F)).
For the conjunctions after, before,
since and till one needs in addition an
ANTE- and a POST-operator, which are
tense-dependent (the main difference
is caused by imperfective vs. perfec-
tive) and modify the arguments of the
phase-operators. Some of the conjunc-
tions have both basic variants, whereas
since admits no iterative usage.
--2•
- 203 -
The meaning of since is expressed by
(P) since: (only particular usage)
SINCE(R1,R2): (for &amp;quot;R1, since R211)
alt(PER(POST((R2)), (R1))) *
and the truth condition for after is
(q) afteri (particular usage of after):
A1TER1(R1,R2): (for &amp;quot;R1, after R21t)
alt(PER((R1),POST((R2)))) * -0110
It turns out that an analysis of tem-
poral conjunctions based only on the
Reicbsnbadh scheme causes some difficul-
ties. It works very well for when and
while (cf. Hornstein 1977) and the Ger-
man equivalents (als/wenn, wahrend and
solange), but for the remaining cases
ANTE- and POST-operations seem to be
inivitable.
10. AN EMPIRICAL CONFIRMATION
By combining the rules for tense-as-
signment and the truth conditions for
the temporal conjunctions (in German
there are seven basic types) and by al-
lowing for some restrictions for their
use (e. g. als only for Past, seit not

<abstract confidence="0.995681163511189">The topic of the paper is the introduction of a formalism that permits a homogeneous representation of definite temporal adverbials, temporal quantifications (as frequency and duration), temporal conjunctions and tenses, and of their combinations with propositions. This unified representation renders it possible to show how these components refer to each other and interact in creating temporal meanings. The formal representation is based on the notions &amp;quot;phase-set&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;phase-operator&amp;quot;, and it involves an interval logic. Furthermore logical connections are used, but the (always troublesome) logical quantifications may be avoided. The expressions are rather near to linguistic structures, which facilitates the link to text analysis. Some emprical confirmations are outlined. 1. THE GENERAL FRAME This paper presents some results that have been obtained in the field of time and tense-phenomena (Kunze 1987). In connection with this some links to text analysis, knowledge representation and inference mechanisms have been taken into account. The formalism presented here differs from what is under label of temporal logic on the market (e. g. Prior (1967), Aqvist/Guenthner (1978). Our main intention is to establish a calculus that is rather near to linguistic structures on one side (for text analysis) and to inference mechanisms on the other side. whole formalism features, i. e. the following components are represented by the same formal means in a way, that it becomes and effective to different components to each other: - The propositions and their validity with respect to time; - Definite temporal adverbials (next Tuesday); - Definite temporal quantifications as times)and duration (three hours), comparision of frequencies, durations etc.; - Temporal conjunctions; - Tenses and their different meanings. The unified representation renders it possible to observe how the components interact in creating temporal meanings and relations. Some details have to be left out here, e. g. the notion &amp;quot;determined time&amp;quot; and the axiomatic basis of the calculus. - 197 - 2. PHASE-SETS AND PROPOSITIONS A phase p is an interval (either unbounded or a span or a moment) which a truth value (denoted by q(p)) is assigned to: : p is considered as an mative phase. q(p) = F p is considered as a denying phase. The intervals are subsets of the time axis U (and never empty!). P is a pair is a set of intervals, and q (the evaluation function) assigns a value to each pe P has to fulfil the following consistency demand: all p&apos;,p&amp;quot; e. P&apos; holds: p&amp;quot; 4 then q(p&apos;) = A phase-set P is called complete, iff the union of all phases of P covers U. Propositions R are replaced by complete phase-sets that express the validity of the time axis U. Such a phase-set, denoted by to be understood as a possible temporal perspective of R. There are propositions that differ from each other in this perspective only: For sleeps in the dining room. one has several such perspectives: He is sleeping there, he sleeps there because the bedroom is painted (for some days), he sleeps always there. SO the phases of CR&gt; are quite different, even with clear syntactic consequences for the underlying verb: The local adverbial may not be omitted in the second and third case!&apos; here completely the following problems: A sophisticated application of nested phase-sets for the representaof discontinuous phases in the motivation of phases (e. g. accord ing to Vendler (1967)) and their adequacy. 3. PHASE-OPERATORS A is a mapping with phase-sets as arguments and values. There are phase-operators with one and with two arguments. A two-place phasecharacterized by the following properties: If = = 1&apos; 1. e. the -set of intervals of the resulting phase-set is the same as of the first argument; For each there is a condition says q(p) is defined by and all This condition implies always that q(p) = F follows from q1(p) = F. the effect of some T-phases of change their. truth value, new phases are not created The characteristic conditions are based on two-place relations between intervals. Let rel( , ) be such a relation. Then we define (by means of rel) to the following scheme: if = T there 11 with F otherwise - 198 - We will use three phase-operators and define their evaluation functions in the following way by (D): P = rel(P21P) is the relation and p overlap&amp;quot;, i. e. 0. P = rel(P2,P) is the relation contains p&amp;quot;, i. e. p. P = rel(P2,p) is the relation and p are not seperated from other&amp;quot;, i. e. is an interval. As an illustration we consider some examples. Needless to say, that their exact represention requires further formal equipment we have not introduced yet. Typical cases for OCC and PER are: (2) Yesterday was bad weather. of (yesterday)and a Tof weather). (3) John worked the whole evening. T-phase of contained a T-phase of works). (yesterday&gt;cf. 7.) There is only a slight difference between the characteristic conditions for OCC and NEX: NEX admits additionally and in the of Allen (1984). Later motivate that NEX is the appropriate phase-operator for the conjunction when. Therefore, sentences of the form (4) when (cf. (N), (0)) will be represented by an expression contains as core. The interpretation is that nothing hapbetween a certain T-phase of a certain T-phase of (if they do not overlap). The next operation we are going to define is a one-place phase-operator with indeterminate character. It may be called &amp;quot;choice&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;singling out&amp;quot; and be denoted by where = is again an arbitrary phase-set: = = (set of intervals unchanged) 1 { T for exactly one p with q(p) = T (if there is some = T-phase in If we need different choices, we write using the first sign as an index in the mathematical sense. Moreover, ve define one-place phaseoperators with parameters: = DA,01 = of intervals unchanged) if = T and there are exactly n T-phases in (1(P) = F otherwise (for all p of one defines for g: assigns the value exactly to the g-th T-phase of if there is one, with certain arrangements for g (e. g. how to express &amp;quot;the last but second&amp;quot; etc.) Finally we define the &amp;quot;alternation&amp;quot; of an arbitrary phase-set = By alternation new phases may created: contains exactly those phases which one gets by joining phases of that are not seperated F otherwise - 199 from each other and have the same value So the intervals of are of intervals of q-values the common of their parts (A)). It is always = and is complete, if is complete. Going from left to right on the time axis U, one has an alternating succession of phases in with respect to the q-values. is the &amp;quot;maximal levelling&amp;quot; of phase-set 4. LOGICAL CONNECTIONS negation of a phase-set is defined as follows: (J) = = PT (set of intervals unchanged) = that -&apos;(R&gt; may be difof non-equivalent phasefor and R! For each two-place functor &amp;quot;a&amp;quot; (e. MI &amp;quot;v&amp;quot;) define a if sets and equal: a = n P* nP* 1 2 = where is the corresponding truth function (e. g. vel for &amp;quot; Y&amp;quot;). Obviously for every phase-operator P-0 expression or. represents both a phase-set and a clear &amp;quot;tauother words a phase-set is &amp;quot;always true&amp;quot;, if is complete. is the phase-set that contains the time axis U as the only interval with the q-value T) reflects the double nature of the aforesaid implication. CONDITIONS The last considerations lead immedeately to the following definitions. The whole formalism requires two types of truth conditions, namely alt(P) = alt(P) * . They have different status: (L) is used, if the phase-set P is considered as a temporal representation of something that is valid, independently of time. (M) is applied,if P is considered as something that represents a certain &amp;quot;time&amp;quot; (expressed by the phases of P). Because of the second possibility, alt appears not only in truth conditions, but it may constitute arguments in phase-operators etc., too. This will be shown in the examples below. Obviously one has for arbitrary P = = iff dtaU3pe ai T &amp; alt(P) * iff 3t eU 3p sP* T &amp; t a SOME COMMENT ON THE By regarding the time axis U as a basic notion one has to take the trouble to consider the topology of U, and gets difficulties with closed and - 200 and open sets, environments etc.. This may be avoided by taking an axiomatic viewpoint: For all operations, relations etc. one formulates the essential properties needed and uses them without direct connection to the time axis. In this way U becomes a part of a model of the whole formalism. This is independent of the fact, that in definitions and explanations U may appear for making clear what is meant. ADVERBI ALS In section 2. we have outlined, how propositions R are substituted by phasesets (II&gt;. The same has to be done for temporal adverbials. First we consider adverbials: (tuesday&gt;is a P, where is the set of all days (as spans p covering together the whole time axis U), and exactly the Tuesdays have the value q(p) = T. For set is the same, but it = T for all p G (evening) has as intervals suitable subintervals of the days with q(p) = T, whereas the remaining parts of the days form phases q(p) = F in (evening)Analo- (year&gt;contains all years as p with q(p) = T, whereas 41986) has the same spans, but exactly one with q(p) = T. Now we combine temporal adverbials with propositions. An exact representation would require that we list all possible structures of phrases, clauses etc. that express a certain combination. of this &amp;quot;standard paraas least on TuesdaysR&amp;quot;. If R is a certain proposition, e. g. = works in the library, then this paraphrase stands (as a remedy) for John works, worked,... in the library every Tuesday. every Tuesday John... Tuesday of every week John... least on Tuesdays John... Examples with truth conditions: (the days, whenR&gt; = OCCUElly&gt;,(R)) (cf. (B) - (E)) (the Tuesdays in 1986. whenR&gt; 000(00((tuesdaY),(R&gt;), (1986&gt;) alt(...) (at least on TuesdaysR (tuesday&gt;OCC(&lt;), (R&gt;) = u° (cf. (J)) (at most on TuesdaysII&gt; = (in 1986 at least on TuesdaysR) (1986) PERC(year&gt;, alt((tuesd)-..00C((kaz), (R)))) (cf. (F)) (1986 is a year, throughout which it is always true, that every Tuesday is a day, when R occurs.) The second argument of PER is a phaseset defined by an alt-operation. This phase-set has as T-phases exactly those maximal periods during which (8) holds. selects the are covered by such a period, and the expression 1986 is such a year (and nothing about other years). &apos; The time of speech L is formally repby a phase-set with phases, namely L itself with q(L) = T, and the two remaining infinite intervals with the q-value F. Then one may (today)= By - 201 using the phase-operator ORD (cf. (I)) introduces (yesterday)etc., and These examples demonstrate the application of logical functors. year) (in this year three timesR) = (R&gt; -NoKAR(00C((R), = (the three timesR this year&gt; KAR(000((R&gt;, alt(...) In (11) a yes-no-decision is expressed (there are three T-phases of (R) in this year), but in (12) a &amp;quot;time&amp;quot; is defined, namely the three T-phases of (R) in this truth conditions are different. The expression in (12) may appear as an argument in other expressions again. Now we apply the operation &amp;quot;choice&amp;quot;: (at most on Tuesdays three times11) occ(xuw, KAR(000((R), x(m)),3)) .•..(tuesday&gt; = 00C((R),x(dly)) determines the T-phases of (R) on a single day, KAR(...,3) keeps them iff there are exactly three (otherwise they become F-phases, cf. (I)), OCC(x(day),...) assigns to the single day the value T iff the T-phases of (R) this day have been preserved. Therefore, a tion over all days if x runs over all days, and the whole expression says that all T-days are Tuesdays. (exactly on Mondays and FridaysR) = OCC((silx&gt;, (R)) ((rigila) v (friday)) = (of. (8), (9)) (never on TuesdaysR&gt; 000((11X), alt(...) = (0f. (9)) As one can see, the expressions render it possible to formulate even rathcomplex temporal relations a comprehensible manner without much redundancy, the necessary arguments appear only once (or twice for certain quantias e. g. (puesday)and In order to handle durations, one needs another phase-operator EXT that is quite similar to KAR and ORD. The argument R stands either for &amp;quot;bare&amp;quot; propositions (without any temporal component) or for propositions with some temporal components. In the latter case the corresponding expression has to be substituted for &lt;It&gt;: (16) Every Tuesday John watches television in the evening. (R&gt; = the eveningR&apos;) R&apos; = watches television. Then one can represent (10 by = 00C( (R&apos;), (evening)) alt(...) (John&apos;s t.v.phases in evenings) and apply (8): (tuesUy) (evening))) = Similarily one obtains (10) from (8). . The truth condition in (8) causes that alt(...) occurs as argument in (10). The sign &amp;quot;=&amp;quot; in the examples means that the left side is defined by the right side, the left side is stripped of one (or mare) temporal components. In this sense (6), (8) and (9) are rules, (7) and (10) include two rules in each case The full and exact form of such rules more standard paraphrases, namely corresponding (syntactic) structures on their lett side. - 202 - 8. TENSES Till now nothing has been said about tenses. It is indeed possible to represent tenses in the formalism that we have outlined. But it is impossible to introduce &amp;quot;universal&amp;quot; rules for tenses. Even between closely related languages like English and German there are essential differences. So it does not make sense to explain here the details for the German tenses (cf. Kunze 1987). The main points in describing tenses are these: At first one needs a distinction between &amp;quot;tense meanings&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;tense forms&amp;quot; (e. g. a Present-Perfectform may be used as Future Perfect). After that one has to introduce special conditions for special tense meanings (e. g. for perfect tenses in German and English, for the aorist in other languages). Further a characterization of tense meanings by a scheme like Reichenbach&apos;s is necessary, including the inof the time of speech On this basis rules for tense-assignment may be formulated expressing which tenses (. meanings) a phase xP or a phase-set P can be assigned to. From the formal point of view tenses then look like very general adverbials, and it is rather easy to explain how tenses and adverbials fit together. Tenseassignments create new expressions in addition to those used above. It is important that the position of the phases of (R) does not depend on the tense R is used with: The tense selects some of these phases by phase-operators. So alt(NEX(xP,e)) * -de is the basic condition for the actual Present (cf. (G)). 9. TEMPORAL CONJUNCTIONS For some temporal conjunctions there are two basic variants, the &amp;quot;particular&amp;quot; usage and the &amp;quot;iterative&amp;quot; usage. We illustrate this phenomenon for when: (particular usage of when): (for &amp;quot;R., when c * (17) When John went to the library, found 10 $. (Once. when) In (17) there is a reference to a single of and a single T-phase of One can show that the truth confor is equivalent to * but this form is avoidable (cf. (H) and the end of 5.). usage of when): (for when ) ) (18) When John went to the library, took the bus. (Whenever) In (18) something is said about all of namely x ) * , which is equivalent to the truth condition for when like while, long as etc. are represented in a similar way with the phase-operator PER (cf. (F)). For the conjunctions after, before, since and till one needs in addition an ANTEand a POST-operator, which are tense-dependent (the main difference is caused by imperfective vs. perfective) and modify the arguments of the phase-operators. Some of the conjunctions have both basic variants, whereas since admits no iterative usage. --2• - 203 - The meaning of since is expressed by (P) since: (only particular usage) (for since * and the truth condition for after is (particular usage of after): (for after * It turns out that an analysis of temporal conjunctions based only on the Reicbsnbadh scheme causes some difficulties. It works very well for when and while (cf. Hornstein 1977) and the Gerequivalents wahrendand solange),but for the remaining cases ANTEand POST-operations seem to be inivitable. 10. AN EMPIRICAL CONFIRMATION By combining the rules for tense-assignment and the truth conditions for the temporal conjunctions (in German there are seven basic types) and by allowing for some restrictions for their g. als only for Past, seit not for Future) one gets for each conjunction a prediction about the possible combinations of tenses in the matrix and the temporal clause. Gelhaus (1974) has published statistical data about the distributions of tenses in the matrix and the temporal clause for German.

The main points in describing tenses are these: At first one needs a distinction between &amp;quot;tense meanings&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;tense forms&amp;quot; (e. g. a Present-Perfectform may be used as Future Perfect). After that one has to introduce special conditions for special tense meanings (e. g. for perfect tenses in German and English, for the aorist in other languages). Further a characterization of tense meanings by a scheme like Reichenbach&apos;s is necessary, including the introduction of the time of speech L°. On this basis rules for tense-assignment may be formulated expressing which tenses (. meanings) a phase xP </context>
