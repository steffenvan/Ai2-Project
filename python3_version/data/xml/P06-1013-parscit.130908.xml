Combination methods are an effective way
of improving system performance. This
paper examines the benefits of system
combination for unsupervised WSD. We
investigate several voting- and arbiter-
based combination strategies over a di-
verse pool of unsupervised WSD systems.
Our combination methods rely on predom-
inant senses which are derived automati-
cally from raw text. Experiments using the
SemCor and Senseval-3 data sets demon-
strate that our ensembles yield signifi-
cantly better results when compared with

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999881666666667">
Word sense disambiguation (WSD), the task of
identifying the intended meanings (senses) of
words in context, holds promise for many NLP
applications requiring broad-coverage language
understanding. Examples include summarization,
question answering, and text simplification. Re-
cent studies have also shown that WSD can ben-
efit machine translation (Vickrey et al., 2005) and
information retrieval (Stokoe, 2005).
Given the potential of WSD for many NLP
tasks, much work has focused on the computa-
tional treatment of sense ambiguity, primarily us-
ing data-driven methods. Most accurate WSD sys-
tems to date are supervised and rely on the avail-
ability of training data, i.e., corpus occurrences of
ambiguous words marked up with labels indicat-
ing the appropriate sense given the context (see
Mihalcea and Edmonds 2004 and the references
therein). A classifier automatically learns disam-
biguation cues from these hand-labeled examples.
Although supervised methods typically achieve
better performance than unsupervised alternatives,
their applicability is limited to those words for
which sense labeled data exists, and their accu-
racy is strongly correlated with the amount of la-
beled data available (Yarowsky and Florian, 2002).
Furthermore, obtaining manually labeled corpora
with word senses is costly and the task must be
repeated for new domains, languages, or sense in-
ventories. Ng (1997) estimates that a high accu-
racy domain independent system for WSD would
probably need a corpus of about 3.2 million sense
tagged words. At a throughput of one word per
minute (Edmonds, 2000), this would require about
27 person-years of human annotation effort.
This paper focuses on unsupervised methods
which we argue are useful for broad coverage
sense disambiguation. Unsupervised WSD algo-
rithms fall into two general classes: those that per-
form token-based WSD by exploiting the simi-
larity or relatedness between an ambiguous word
and its context (e.g., Lesk 1986); and those that
perform type-based WSD, simply by assigning
all instances of an ambiguous word its most fre-
quent (i.e., predominant) sense (e.g., McCarthy
et al. 2004; Galley and McKeown 2003). The pre-
dominant senses are automatically acquired from
raw text without recourse to manually annotated
data. The motivation for assigning all instances
of a word to its most prevalent sense stems from
the observation that current supervised approaches
rarely outperform the simple heuristic of choos-
ing the most common sense in the training data,
despite taking local context into account (Hoste
et al., 2002). Furthermore, the approach allows
sense inventories to be tailored to specific do-
mains.
The work presented here evaluates and com-
pares the performance of well-established unsu-
pervised WSD algorithms. We show that these
algorithms yield sufficiently diverse outputs, thus
motivating the use of combination methods for im-
proving WSD performance. While combination
approaches have been studied previously for su-
pervised WSD (Florian et al., 2002), their use
in an unsupervised setting is, to our knowledge,
novel. We examine several existing and novel
combination methods and demonstrate that our
combined systems consistently outperform the

state-of-the-art (e.g., McCarthy et al. 2004). Im-
portantly, our WSD algorithms and combination
methods do not make use of training material in
any way, nor do they use the first sense informa-
tion available in WordNet.

their performance on SemCor (Miller et al., 1993).

2 The Disambiguation Algorithms
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999935133333334">
In this section we briefly describe the unsuper-
vised WSD algorithms used in our experiments.
We selected methods that vary along the follow-
ing dimensions: (a) the type of WSD performed
(i.e., token-based vs. type-based), (b) the represen-
tation and size of the context surrounding an am-
biguous word (i.e., graph-based vs. word-based,
document vs. sentence), and (c) the number and
type of semantic relations considered for disam-
biguation. We base most of our discussion below
on the WordNet sense inventory; however, the ap-
proaches are not limited to this particular lexicon
but could be adapted for other resources with tra-
ditional dictionary-like sense definitions and alter-
native structure.

originally introduced by Lesk (1986) for perform-
ing token-based WSD. The method assigns a sense
to a target word by comparing the dictionary defi-
nitions of each of its senses with those of the words
in the surrounding context. The sense whose defi-
nition has the highest overlap (i.e., words in com-
mon) with the context words is assumed to be the
correct one. Banerjee and Pedersen (2003) aug-
ment the dictionary definition (gloss) of each sense
with the glosses of related words and senses. The
extended glosses increase the information avail-
able in estimating the overlap between ambiguous
words and their surrounding context.
The range of relationships used to extend the
glosses is a parameter, and can be chosen from
any combination of WordNet relations. For every
sense sk of the target word we estimate:

<equation confidence="0.878271">
SenseScore(sk) = ∑ Overlap(context,Rel(sk))
RelERelations
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.988698809523809">
where context is a simple (space separated) con-
catenation of all words wi for −n &lt; i &lt; n,i =� 0 in
a context window of length fn around the target
word w0. The overlap scoring mechanism is also
parametrized and can be adjusted to take the into
account gloss length or to ignore function words.
Distributional and WordNet Similarity
McCarthy et al. (2004) propose a method for
automatically ranking the senses of ambiguous
words from raw text. Key in their approach is the
observation that distributionally similar neighbors
often provide cues about a word’s senses. As-
suming that a set of neighbors is available, sense
ranking is equivalent to quantifying the degree
of similarity among the neighbors and the sense
descriptions of the polysemous word.
Let N(w) = {n1,n2,...,nk} be the k most (dis-
tributionally) similar words to an ambiguous tar-
get word w and senses(w) = {s1,s2,...sn} the set
of senses for w. For each sense si and for each
neighbor nj, the algorithm selects the neighbor’s
sense which has the highest WordNet similarity
score (wnss) with regard to si. The ranking score
of sense si is then increased as a function of the
WordNet similarity score and the distributional
similarity score (dss) between the target word and
the neighbor:
where wnss(si,nj) = max wnss(si,nsx).
nsxEsenses(nj)
The predominant sense is simply the sense with
the highest ranking score (RankScore) and can be
consequently used to perform type-based disam-
biguation. The method presented above has four
parameters: (a) the semantic space model repre-
senting the distributional properties of the target
words (it is acquired from a large corpus repre-
sentative of the domain at hand and can be aug-
mented with syntactic relations such as subject or
object), (b) the measure of distributional similarity
for discovering neighbors (c) the number of neigh-
bors that the ranking score takes into account, and
(d) the measure of sense similarity.

resented via lexical chains, i.e., sequences of re-
lated words spanning a topical text unit (Mor-
ris and Hirst, 1991). Algorithms for computing
lexical chains often perform WSD before infer-
ring which words are semantically related. Here
we describe one such disambiguation algorithm,
proposed by Galley and McKeown (2003), while
omitting the details of creating the lexical chains
themselves.
Galley and McKeown’s (2003) method consists
of two stages. First, a graph is built represent-
ing all possible interpretations of the target words

in question. The text is processed sequentially,
comparing each word against all words previously
read. If a relation exists between the senses of the
current word and any possible sense of a previous
word, a connection is formed between the appro-
priate words and senses. The strength of the con-
nection is a function of the type of relationship and
of the distance between the words in the text (in
terms of words, sentences and paragraphs). Words
are represented as nodes in the graph and seman-
tic relations as weighted edges. Again, the set of
relations being considered is a parameter that can
be tuned experimentally.
In the disambiguation stage, all occurrences of a
given word are collected together. For each sense
of a target word, the strength of all connections
involving that sense are summed, giving that sense
a unified score. The sense with the highest unified
score is chosen as the correct sense for the target
word. In subsequent stages the actual connections
comprising the winning unified score are used as a
basis for computing the lexical chains.
The algorithm is based on the “one sense per
discourse” hypothesis and uses information from
every occurrence of the ambiguous target word in
order to decide its appropriate sense. It is there-
fore a type-based algorithm, since it tries to de-
termine the sense of the word in the entire doc-
ument/discourse at once, and not separately for
each instance.

spired by lexical chains, Navigli and Velardi
(2005) developed Structural Semantic Intercon-
nections (SSI), a WSD algorithm which makes use
of an extensive lexical knowledge base. The latter
is primarily based on WordNet and its standard re-
lation set (i.e., hypernymy, meronymy, antonymy,
similarity, nominalization, pertainymy) but is also
enriched with collocation information represent-
ing semantic relatedness between sense pairs. Col-
locations are gathered from existing resources
(such as the Oxford Collocations, the Longman
Language Activator, and collocation web sites).
Each collocation is mapped to the WordNet sense
inventory in a semi-automatic manner (Navigli,
2005) and transformed into a relatedness edge.
Given a local word context C = {w1,...,wn},

Valid interconnections are computed in advance
on the lexical database, not at runtime.
Disambiguation is performed in an iterative
fashion. At each step, for each sense s of a word
in C (the set of senses of words yet to be disam-
biguated), SSI determines the degree of connectiv-
ity between s and the other senses in C:

∑ |Interconn(s,s)|

<bodyText confidence="0.999837137931034">
where Interconn(s,s0) is the set of interconnec-
tions between senses s and s0. The contribution of a
single interconnection is given by the reciprocal of
its length, calculated as the number of edges con-
necting its ends. The overall degree of connectiv-
ity is then normalized by the number of contribut-
ing interconnections. The highest ranking sense s
of word wi is chosen and the senses of wi are re-
moved from the context C. The procedure termi-
nates when either C is the empty set or there is no
sense such that its SSIScore exceeds a fixed thresh-
old.
Summary The properties of the different
WSD algorithms just described are summarized
in Table 1. The methods vary in the amount of
data they employ for disambiguation. SSI and Ex-
tended Gloss Overlap (Overlap) rely on sentence-
level information for disambiguation whereas Mc-
Carthy et al. (2004) (Similarity) and Galley and
McKeown (2003) (LexChains) utilize the entire
document or corpus. This enables the accumula-
tion of large amounts of data regarding the am-
biguous word, but does not allow separate consid-
eration of each individual occurrence of that word.
LexChains and Overlap take into account a re-
stricted set of semantic relations (paths of length
one) between any two words in the whole docu-
ment, whereas SSI and Similarity use a wider set
of relations.

<bodyText confidence="0.999940472222222">
We evaluated the disambiguation algorithms out-
lined above on two tasks: predominant sense ac-
quisition and token-based WSD. As previously
explained, Overlap and SSI were not designed for
acquiring predominant senses (see Table 1), but
a token-based WSD algorithm can be trivially
modified to acquire predominant senses by dis-
ambiguating every occurrence of the target word
in context and selecting the sense which was cho-
sen most frequently. Type-based WSD algorithms
simply tag all occurrences of a target word with its
predominant sense, disregarding the surrounding
context.
Our first set of experiments was conducted on
the SemCor corpus, on the same 2,595 polyse-
mous nouns (53,674 tokens) used as a test set by
McCarthy et al. (2004). These nouns were attested
in SemCor with a frequency &gt; 2 and occurred in
the British National Corpus (BNC) more than 10
times. We used the WordNet 1.7.1 sense inventory.
The following notation describes our evaluation
measures: W is the set of all noun types in the
SemCor corpus (|W |= 2,595), and Wf is the set
of noun types with a dominant sense. senses(w)
is the set of senses for noun type w, while fs(w)
and fm(w) refer to w’s first sense according to the
SemCor gold standard and our algorithms, respec-
tively. Finally, T(w) is the set of tokens of w and
senses(t) denotes the sense assigned to token t ac-
cording to SemCor.
We first measure how well our algorithms can
identify the predominant sense, if one exists:
A baseline for this task can be easily defined for
each word type by selecting a sense at random
from its sense inventory and assuming that this is
the predominant sense:

<bodyText confidence="0.999954666666667">
We evaluate the algorithms’ disambiguation per-
formance by measuring the ratio of tokens for
which our models choose the right sense:

<bodyText confidence="0.999840583333333">
In the predominant sense detection task, in case of
ties in SemCor, any one of the predominant senses
was considered correct. Also, all algorithms were
designed to randomly choose from among the top
scoring options in case of a tie in the calculated
scores. This introduces a small amount of ran-
domness (less than 0.5%) in the accuracy calcu-
lation, and was done to avoid the pitfall of default-
ing to the first sense listed in WordNet, which is
usually the actual predominant sense (the order of
senses in WordNet is based primarily on the Sem-
Cor sense distribution).

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999273">
3.2 Parameter Settings
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999739146341464">
We did not specifically tune the parameters of our
WSD algorithms on the SemCor corpus, as our
goal was to use hand labeled data solely for testing
purposes. We selected parameters that have been
considered “optimal” in the literature, although
admittedly some performance gains could be ex-
pected had parameter optimization taken place.
For Overlap, we used the semantic relations
proposed by Banerjee and Pedersen (2003),
namely hypernyms, hyponyms, meronyms,
holonyms, and troponym synsets. We also
adopted their overlap scoring mechanism which
treats each gloss as a bag of words and assigns an
n word overlap the score of n2. Function words
were not considered in the overlap computation.
For LexChains, we used the relations reported
in Galley and McKeown (2003). These are all
first-order WordNet relations, with the addition of
the siblings – two words are considered siblings
if they are both hyponyms of the same hypernym.
The relations have different weights, depending
on their type and the distance between the words
in the text. These weights were imported from
Galley and McKeown into our implementation
without modification.
Because the SemCor corpus is relatively small
(less than 700,00 words), it is not ideal for con-
structing a neighbor thesaurus appropriate for Mc-
Carthy et al.’s (2004) method. The latter requires
each word to participate in a large number of co-
occurring contexts in order to obtain reliable dis-
tributional information. To overcome this prob-
lem, we followed McCarthy et al. and extracted
the neighbor thesaurus from the entire BNC. We
also recreated their semantic space, using a RASP-
parsed (Briscoe and Carroll, 2002) version of the
BNC and their set of dependencies (i.e., Verb-
Object, Verb-Subject, Noun-Noun and Adjective-
Noun relations). Similarly to McCarthy et al., we
used Lin’s (1998) measure of distributional simi-
larity, and considered only the 50 highest ranked

The performance of the individual algorithms is
shown in Table 2. We also include the baseline
discussed in Section 3 and the upper bound of
defaulting to the first (i.e., most frequent) sense
provided by the manually annotated SemCor. We
report predominant sense accuracy (Accps), and
WSD accuracy when using the automatically ac-
quired predominant sense (Accwsd/ps). For token-
based algorithms, we also report their WSD per-
formance in context, i.e., without use of the pre-
dominant sense (Accwsd/dir).
As expected, the accuracy scores in the WSD
task are lower than the respective scores in the
predominant sense task, since detecting the pre-
dominant sense correctly only insures the correct
tagging of the instances of the word with that
first sense. All methods perform significantly bet-
ter than the baseline in the predominant sense de-
tection task (using a χ2-test, as indicated in Ta-
ble 2). LexChains and Overlap perform signif-
icantly worse than Similarity and SSI, whereas
LexChains is not significantly different from Over-
lap. Likewise, the difference in performance be-
tween SSI and Similarity is not significant. With
respect to WSD, all the differences in performance
are statistically significant.

an extended gloss and a word’s context, the comparison is
done between two extended glosses of two synsets.
2The LexChains results presented here are not directly
comparable to those reported by Galley and McKeown
(2003), since they tested on a subset of SemCor, and included
monosemous nouns. They also used the first sense in Sem-
Cor in case of ties. The results for the Similarity method are
slightly better than those reported by McCarthy et al. (2004)
due to minor improvements in implementation.

Interestingly, using the predominant sense de-
tected by the Gloss Overlap and the SSI algo-
rithm to tag all instances is preferable to tagging
each instance individually (compare Accwsd/dir
and Accwsd/ps for Overlap and SSI in Table 2).
This means that a large part of the instances which
were not tagged individually with the predominant
sense were actually that sense.
A close examination of the performance of the
individual methods in the predominant-sense de-
tection task shows that while the accuracy of all
the methods is within a range of 7%, the actual
words for which each algorithm gives the cor-
rect predominant sense are very different. Table 3
shows the degree of overlap in assigning the ap-
propriate predominant sense among the four meth-
ods. As can be seen, the largest amount of over-
lap is between Similarity and SSI, and this cor-
responds approximately to 2 3 of the words they
correctly label. This means that each of these two
methods gets more than 350 words right which the
other labels incorrectly.
If we had an “oracle” which would tell us
which method to choose for each word, we would
achieve approximately 82.4% in the predominant
sense task, giving us 58% in the WSD task. We
see that there is a large amount of complementa-
tion between the algorithms, where the successes
of one make up for the failures of the others. This
suggests that the errors of the individual methods
are sufficiently uncorrelated, and that some advan-
tage can be gained by combining their predictions.

An important finding in machine learning is that
a set of classifiers whose individual decisions are
combined in some way (an ensemble) can be more
accurate than any of its component classifiers, pro-
vided that the individual components are relatively
accurate and diverse (Dietterich, 1997). This sim-
ple idea has been applied to a variety of classi-

recognition to medical diagnosis, part-of-speech

Since our effort is focused exclusively on un-
supervised methods, we cannot use most ma-
chine learning approaches for creating an en-
semble (e.g., stacking, confidence-based combina-
tion), as they require a labeled training set. We
therefore examined several basic ensemble com-
bination approaches that do not require parameter
estimation from training data.
We define Score(Mi,sj) as the (normalized)
score which a method Mi gives to word sense sj.
The predominant sense calculated by method Mi

better than the best individual methods, i.e., Simi-
larity and SSI. On the WSD task, the voting, prob-
ability mixture, and rank-based ensembles signif-
icantly outperform the arbiter-based one. The per-
formances of the probability mixture, and rank-
based combinations do not differ significantly but
both ensembles are significantly better than vot-
ing. One of the factors contributing to the arbiter’s
worse performance (compared to the other ensem-
bles) is the fact that in many cases (almost 30%),
none of the senses suggested by the disagreeing
methods is correct. In these cases, there is no way
for the arbiter to select the correct sense. We also
examined the relative contribution of each compo-
nent to overall performance. Table 5 displays the
drop in performance by eliminating any particular
component from the rank-based ensemble (indi-
cated by −). The system that contributes the most
to the ensemble is SSI. Interestingly, Overlap and
Similarity yield similar improvements in WSD ac-
curacy (0.6 and 0.9, respectively) when added to
the ensemble.
Figure 1 shows the WSD accuracy of the best
single methods and the ensembles as a function of
the noun frequency in SemCor. We can see that
there is at least one ensemble outperforming any
single method in every frequency band and that
the rank-based ensemble consistently outperforms
Similarity and SSI in all bands. Although Similar-
ity has an advantage over SSI for low and medium
frequency words, it delivers worse performance
for high frequency words. This is possibly due to
the quality of neighbors obtained for very frequent
words, which are not semantically distinct enough
to reliably discriminate between different senses.
Table 6 lists the performance of the rank-based
ensemble on the Senseval-3 (noun) corpus. We
also report results for the best individual method,
namely SSI, and compare our results with the best
unsupervised system that participated in Senseval-

target word with the domains of its senses and uses
a version of WordNet augmented with domain la-
bels (e.g., economy, geography). Our baseline se-
lects the first sense randomly and uses it to disam-
biguate all instances of a target word. Our upper
bound defaults to the first sense from SemCor. We
report precision, recall and Fscore. In cases where
precision and recall figures coincide, the algorithm
has 100% coverage.
As can be seen the rank-based, ensemble out-
performs both SSI and the IRST-DDD system.
This is an encouraging result, suggesting that there
may be advantages in developing diverse classes
of unsupervised WSD algorithms for system com-
bination. The results in Table 6 are higher than
those reported for SemCor (see Table 4). This is
expected since the Senseval-3 data set contains
monosemous nouns as well. Taking solely polyse-
mous nouns into account, SSI’s Fscore is 53.39%
and the ranked-based ensemble’s 55.0%. We fur-
ther note that not all of the components in our en-
semble are optimal. Predominant senses for Lesk
and LexChains were estimated from the Senseval-
3 data, however a larger corpus would probably
yield more reliable estimates.

6 Conclusions and Discussion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998885205128205">
In this paper we have presented an evaluation
study of four well-known approaches to unsuper-
vised WSD. Our comparison involved type- and
token-based disambiguation algorithms relying on
different kinds of WordNet relations and different
amounts of corpus data. Our experiments revealed
two important findings. First, type-based disam-
biguation yields results superior to a token-based
approach. Using predominant senses is preferable
to disambiguating instances individually, even for
token-based algorithms. Second, the outputs of
the different approaches examined here are suffi-
ciently diverse to motivate combination methods
for unsupervised WSD. We defined several ensem-
bles on the predominant sense outputs of individ-
ual methods and showed that combination systems
outperformed their best components both on the
SemCor and Senseval-3 data sets.
The work described here could be usefully em-
ployed in two tasks: (a) to create preliminary an-
notations, thus supporting the “annotate automati-
cally, correct manually” methodology used to pro-
vide high volume annotation in the Penn Treebank
project; and (b) in combination with supervised
WSD methods that take context into account; for
instance, such methods could default to an unsu-
pervised system for unseen words or words with
uninformative contexts.
In the future we plan to integrate more com-
ponents into our ensembles. These include not
only domain driven disambiguation algorithms
(Strapparava et al., 2004) but also graph theoretic
ones (Mihalcea, 2005) as well as algorithms that
quantify the degree of association between senses
and their co-occurring contexts (Mohammad and
Hirst, 2006). Increasing the number of compo-
nents would allow us to employ more sophisti-
cated combination methods such as unsupervised
rank aggregation algorithms (Tan and Jin, 2004).

Extended Gloss Overlap Gloss Overlap was originally introduced by Lesk (1986) for performing token-based WSD. The method assigns a sense to a target word by comparing the dictionary definitions of each of its senses with those of the words in the surrounding context. The sense whose definition has the highest overlap (i.e., words in common) with the context words is assumed to be the correct one. Banerjee and Pedersen (2003) augment the dictionary definition (gloss) of each sense with the glosses of related words and senses. The extended glosses increase the information available in estimating the overlap between ambiguous words and their surrounding context. The range of relationships used to extend the glosses is a parameter, and can be chosen from any combination of WordNet relations. For every sense sk of the target word we estimate: SenseScore(sk) = ∑ Overlap(context,Rel(sk)) RelERelations where context is a simple (space separated) concatenation of all words wi for −n &lt; i &lt; n,i =� 0 in a context window of l</context>

We selected parameters that have been considered “optimal” in the literature, although admittedly some performance gains could be expected had parameter optimization taken place. For Overlap, we used the semantic relations proposed by Banerjee and Pedersen (2003), namely hypernyms, hyponyms, meronyms, holonyms, and troponym synsets. We also adopted their overlap scoring mechanism which treats each gloss as a bag of words and assigns an n word overlap the score of n2. Function words were not considered in the overlap computation. For LexChains, we used the relations reported in Galley and McKeown (2003). These are all first-order WordNet relations, with the addition of the siblings – two words are considered siblings if they are both hyponyms of the same hypernym. The relations have different weights, depending on their type and the distance between th</context>

These weights were imported from Galley and McKeown into our implementation without modification. Because the SemCor corpus is relatively small (less than 700,00 words), it is not ideal for constructing a neighbor thesaurus appropriate for McCarthy et al.’s (2004) method. The latter requires each word to participate in a large number of cooccurring contexts in order to obtain reliable distributional information. To overcome this problem, we followed McCarthy et al. and extracted the neighbor thesaurus from the entire BNC. We also recreated their semantic space, using a RASPparsed (Briscoe and Carroll, 2002) version of the BNC and their set of dependencies (i.e., VerbObject, Verb-Subject, Noun-Noun and AdjectiveNoun relations).

We see that there is a large amount of complementation between the algorithms, where the successes of one make up for the failures of the others. This suggests that the errors of the individual methods are sufficiently uncorrelated, and that some advantage can be gained by combining their predictions. 4 Combination Methods An important finding in machine learning is that a set of classifiers whose individual decisions are combined in some way (an ensemble) can be more accurate than any of its component classifiers, provided that the individual components are relatively accurate and diverse (Dietterich, 1997). This simple idea has been applied to a variety of classification problems ranging from optical character recognition to medical diagnosis, part-of-speech tagging (see Dietterich 1997 and van Halteren et al. 2001 for overviews), and notably supervised 101 WSD (Florian et al., 2002). Since our effort is focused exclusively on unsupervised methods, we cannot use most machine learning approaches for creating an ensemble (e.g., stacking, confidence-based combination), as they require a labeled training set.

Furthermore, obtaining manually labeled corpora with word senses is costly and the task must be repeated for new domains, languages, or sense inventories. Ng (1997) estimates that a high accuracy domain independent system for WSD would probably need a corpus of about 3.2 million sense tagged words. At a throughput of one word per minute (Edmonds, 2000), this would require about 27 person-years of human annotation effort. This paper focuses on unsupervised methods which we argue are useful for broad coverage sense disambiguation. Unsupervised WSD algorithms fall into two general classes: those that perform token-based WSD by exploiting the similarity or relatedness between an ambiguous word and its context (e.g., Lesk 1986); and those that perform type-based WSD, simply by assigning all instances of an ambiguous word its most frequent (i.e., predominant) sense (e.g., McCarthy et al. 2004; Galley and McKeown 2003).

This simple idea has been applied to a variety of classification problems ranging from optical character recognition to medical diagnosis, part-of-speech tagging (see Dietterich 1997 and van Halteren et al. 2001 for overviews), and notably supervised 101 WSD (Florian et al., 2002). Since our effort is focused exclusively on unsupervised methods, we cannot use most machine learning approaches for creating an ensemble (e.g., stacking, confidence-based combination), as they require a labeled training set. We therefore examined several basic ensemble combination approaches that do not require parameter estimation from training data. We define Score(Mi,sj) as the (normalized) score which a method Mi gives to word sense sj. The predominant sense calculated by method Mi for word w is then determined by: PS(Mi,w) = argmax Score(Mi,sj) sjcsenses(w) All ensemble methods receive </context>

This paper focuses on unsupervised methods which we argue are useful for broad coverage sense disambiguation. Unsupervised WSD algorithms fall into two general classes: those that perform token-based WSD by exploiting the similarity or relatedness between an ambiguous word and its context (e.g., Lesk 1986); and those that perform type-based WSD, simply by assigning all instances of an ambiguous word its most frequent (i.e., predominant) sense (e.g., McCarthy et al. 2004; Galley and McKeown 2003). The predominant senses are automatically acquired from raw text without recourse to manually annotated data. The motivation for assigning all instances of a word to its most prevalent sense stems from the observation that current supervised approaches rarely outperform the simple heuristic of choosing the most common sense in the training data, despite taking local context into account (Hoste et al., 2002).

Lexical Chains Lexical cohesion is often represented via lexical chains, i.e., sequences of related words spanning a topical text unit (Morris and Hirst, 1991). Algorithms for computing lexical chains often perform WSD before inferring which words are semantically related. Here we describe one such disambiguation algorithm, proposed by Galley and McKeown (2003), while omitting the details of creating the lexical chains themselves. Galley and McKeown’s (2003) method consists of two stages. First, a graph is built representing all possible interpretations of the target words RankScore(si) = ∑ dss(w,nj) njENw wnss(si,nj) ∑ wnss(sZ ,nj) s�iEsenses(w) 98 in question. The text is processed sequentially, comparing each word against all words previously read. If a relation exists between the senses of the current word and any possible sense of a previous word, a connection is formed between the appropriate words and senses. The strength of the connection is</context>

The highest ranking sense s of word wi is chosen and the senses of wi are removed from the context C. The procedure terminates when either C is the empty set or there is no sense such that its SSIScore exceeds a fixed threshold. Summary The properties of the different WSD algorithms just described are summarized in Table 1. The methods vary in the amount of data they employ for disambiguation. SSI and Extended Gloss Overlap (Overlap) rely on sentencelevel information for disambiguation whereas McCarthy et al. (2004) (Similarity) and Galley and McKeown (2003) (LexChains) utilize the entire document or corpus. This enables the accumulation of large amounts of data regarding the ambiguous word, but does not allow separate consideration of each individual occurrence of that word. LexChains and Overlap take into account a restricted set of semantic relations (paths of length one) between any two words in the whole document, whereas SSI and Similarity use a wider set of relations.

We selected parameters that have been considered “optimal” in the literature, although admittedly some performance gains could be expected had parameter optimization taken place. For Overlap, we used the semantic relations proposed by Banerjee and Pedersen (2003), namely hypernyms, hyponyms, meronyms, holonyms, and troponym synsets. We also adopted their overlap scoring mechanism which treats each gloss as a bag of words and assigns an n word overlap the score of n2. Function words were not considered in the overlap computation. For LexChains, we used the relations reported in Galley and McKeown (2003). These are all first-order WordNet relations, with the addition of the siblings – two words are considered siblings if they are both hyponyms of the same hypernym. The relations have different weights, depending on their type and the distance between the words in the text. These weights were imported from Galley and McKeown into our implementation without modification.

Likewise, the difference in performance between SSI and Similarity is not significant. With respect to WSD, all the differences in performance are statistically significant. 1This measure is identical to the Extended gloss Overlap from Section 2, but instead of searching for overlap between an extended gloss and a word’s context, the comparison is done between two extended glosses of two synsets. 2The LexChains results presented here are not directly comparable to those reported by Galley and McKeown (2003), since they tested on a subset of SemCor, and included monosemous nouns. They also used the first sense in SemCor in case of ties. The results for the Similarity method are slightly better than those reported by McCarthy et al.

We base most of our discussion below on the WordNet sense inventory; however, the approaches are not limited to this particular lexicon but could be adapted for other resources with traditional dictionary-like sense definitions and alternative structure. Extended Gloss Overlap Gloss Overlap was originally introduced by Lesk (1986) for performing token-based WSD. The method assigns a sense to a target word by comparing the dictionary definitions of each of its senses with those of the words in the surrounding context. The sense whose definition has the highest overlap (i.e., words in common) with the context words is assumed to be the correct one. Banerjee and Pedersen (2003) augment the dictionary definition (gloss) of each sense with the glosses of related words and senses.

They also used the first sense in SemCor in case of ties. The results for the Similarity method are slightly better than those reported by McCarthy et al.

Lexical Chains Lexical cohesion is often represented via lexical chains, i.e., sequences of related words spanning a topical text unit (Morris and Hirst, 1991). Algorithms for computing lexical chains often perform WSD before inferring which words are semantically related. Here we describe one such disambiguation algorithm, proposed by Galley and McKeown (2003), while omitting the details of creating the lexical chains themselves. Galley and McKeown’s (2003) method consists of two stages. First, a graph is built representing all possible interpretations of the target words RankScore(si) = ∑ dss(w,nj) njENw wnss(si,nj) ∑ wnss(sZ ,nj) s�iEsenses(w) 98 in question.

In subsequent stages the actual connections comprising the winning unified score are used as a basis for computing the lexical chains. The algorithm is based on the “one sense per discourse” hypothesis and uses information from every occurrence of the ambiguous target word in order to decide its appropriate sense. It is therefore a type-based algorithm, since it tries to determine the sense of the word in the entire document/discourse at once, and not separately for each instance. Structural Semantic Interconnections Inspired by lexical chains, Navigli and Velardi (2005) developed Structural Semantic Interconnections (SSI), a WSD algorithm which makes use of an extensive lexical knowledge base.

A classifier automatically learns disambiguation cues from these hand-labeled examples. Although supervised methods typically achieve better performance than unsupervised alternatives, their applicability is limited to those words for which sense labeled data exists, and their accuracy is strongly correlated with the amount of labeled data available (Yarowsky and Florian, 2002). Furthermore, obtaining manually labeled corpora with word senses is costly and the task must be repeated for new domains, languages, or sense inventories. Ng (1997) estimates that a high accuracy domain independent system for WSD would probably need a corpus of about 3.2 million sense tagged words. At a throughput of one word per minute (Edmonds, 2000), this would require about 27 person-years of human annotation effort. This paper focuses on unsupervised methods which we argue are useful for broad coverage sense disambiguation.

The work described here could be usefully employed in two tasks: (a) to create preliminary annotations, thus supporting the “annotate automatically, correct manually” methodology used to provide high volume annotation in the Penn Treebank project; and (b) in combination with supervised WSD methods that take context into account; for instance, such methods could default to an unsupervised system for unseen words or words with uninformative contexts. In the future we plan to integrate more components into our ensembles. These include not only domain driven disambiguation algorithms (Strapparava et al., 2004) but also graph theoretic ones (Mihalcea, 2005) as well as algorithms that quantify the degree of association between senses and their co-occurring contexts (Mohammad and Hirst, 2006). Increasing the number of components would allow us to employ more sophisticated combination methods such as unsupervised rank aggregation algorithms (Tan and Jin, 2004).
