Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999669266666667">
We present an overview of recent work in which eye
movements are monitored as people follow spoken
instructions to move objects or pictures in a visual workspace.
Subjects naturally make saccadic eye-movements to objects
that are closely time-locked to relevant information in the
instruction. Thus the eye-movements provide a window into
the rapid mental processes that underlie spoken language
comprehension. We review studies of reference resolution,
word recognition, and pragmatic effects on syntactic
ambiguity resolution. Our studies show that people seek to
establish reference with respect to their behavioral goals
during the earliest moments of linguistic processing.
Moreover, referentially relevant non-linguistic information
immediately affects how the linguistic input is initially
structured.

Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999854644444445">
Many important questions about language comprehension
can only be answered by examining processes that are
closely time-locked to the linguistic input. These processes
take place quite rapidly and they are largely opaque to
introspection. As a consequence, psycholinguists have
increasingly turned to experimental methods designed to tap
real-time language processing. These include a variety of
reading time measures as well as paradigms in which
subjects monitor the incoming speech for targets or respond
to visually presented probes. The hope is that these &amp;quot;on-
line&amp;quot; measures can provide information that can be used to
inform and evaluate explicit computational models of
language processing.
Although on-line measures have provided increasingly
fine-grained information about the time-course of language
processing, they are also limited in some important respects.
Perhaps the most serious limitation is that they cannot be
used to study language in natural tasks with real-world
referents. This makes it difficult to study how interpretation
develops. Moreover, the emphasis on processing
&amp;quot;decontextualized&amp;quot; language may be underestimating the
importance of interpretive processes in immediate language
processing.
Recently, we have been exploring a new paradigm for
studying spoken language comprehension. Participants in
our experiments follow spoken instructions to touch or
manipulate objects in a visual workspace while we monitor
their eye-movements using a lightweight camera mounted
on a headband. The camera, manufactured by Applied
Scientific Laboratories, provides an infrared image of the
eye at 60Hz. The center of the pupil and the corneal
reflection are tracked to determine the orbit of the eye
relative to the head. Accuracy is better than one degree of
arc, with virtually unrestricted head and body movements
[Ballard, Hayhoe, and Pelz, 1995]. Instructions are spoken
into a microphone connected to a Hi-8 VCR. The VCR also
records the participant&apos;s field of view from a &amp;quot;scene&amp;quot;
camera mounted on the headband. The participant&apos;s gaze
fixation is superimposed on the video image We analyze
each frame of the instructions to determine the location and
timing of eye movements with respect to critical words in
the instruction.
We find that subjects make eye-movements to objects in
the visual workspace that are closely time-locked to relevant
information in the instruction. Thus the timing and patterns

of the eye movements provide a window into
comprehension processes as the speech unfolds. Unlike
most of the on-line measures that have been used to study
spoken language processing in the past, our procedure can
be used to examine comprehension during natural tasks with
real-world referents [Tanenhaus, M. K., Spivey-Knowlton,
M. J., Eberhard, K. M., &amp; Sedivy, J. C., 1996].
In the remainder of this paper, we review some of our
recent work using the visual world paradigm. We will focus
on three areas: (a) reference resolution; (b) word
recognition, and (c) the interaction of referential context and
syntactic ambiguity resolution.

Evidence for Incremental Interpretation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999980980392157">
In order to investigate the time course with which people
establish reference we use different displays to manipulate
where in an instruction the referent of a definite noun phrase
becomes unique. The timing and patterns of the eye-
movements clearly show that people establish reference
incrementally by continuously evaluating the information in
the instruction against the alternatives in the visual
workspace. For example, in one experiment [Eberhard,
Spivey-Knowlton, Sedivy &amp; Tanenhaus, 1995], participants
were told to touch one of four blocks. The blocks varied
along three dimensions: marking (plain or starred), color
(pink, yellow, blue and red) and shape (square or rectangle).
The instructions referred to the block using a definite noun
phrase with adjectives (e.g., &amp;quot;Touch the starred yellow
square.&amp;quot;). The display determined which word in the noun
phrase disambiguated the target block with respect to the
visual alternatives For example, the earliest point of
disambiguation would be after &amp;quot;starred&amp;quot; if only one of the
blocks was starred, after &amp;quot;yellow&amp;quot; if only one of the starred
blocks was yellow, and after &amp;quot;square&amp;quot; if there were two
starred yellow blocks, only one of which was a square
(Instructions with definite noun phrases always had a unique
referent).
An instruction began with subjects looking at a fixation
cross. We then measured the latency from the beginning of
the noun phrase until the onset of the eye-movement to the
target object. Subjects made eye-movements before
touching the target block on about 75% of the trials.
Eye-movement latencies increased monotonically as the
point of disambiguation shifted from the marking adjective
to the color adjective to the head noun. Moreover, eye-
movements were launched within 300 milliseconds of We
end of the disambiguating word. It takes about 200
milliseconds from the point that an eye-movement is
programmed until when the eye actually begins to move.
On average then, participants began programming an eye-
movement to the target block once they had heard the
disambiguating word and Mug they had finished hearing
the next word in the instruction.
We used the same logic in an experiment with displays
containing more objects and syntactically more complex
instructions [Eberhard et al, 1995]. Participants were
instructed to move miniature playing cards placed on slots
on a 5X5 vertical board. Seven cards were displayed on
each trial. A trial consisted of a sequence of three
instructions. On the instructions of interest, there were two
cards of the same suit and denomination in the display. The
target card was disambiguated using a restrictive relative
clause, e.g. &amp;quot;Put the five of hearts that is below the eight of
clubs above the three of diamonds.&amp;quot; Figure 1 shows one of
the displays for this instruction.

</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.999992375">
The display determined the point of disambiguation in the
instruction. For the display in Figure 1, the point of
disambiguation occurs after the word &amp;quot;eight&amp;quot; because only
one of the fives is below an eight. We also used an early
point of disambiguation display in which only one of the
potential target cards was immediately below a&amp;quot; &amp;quot;context&amp;quot;
card and a late point of disambiguation display in which the
denomination of the &amp;quot;context&amp;quot; card disambiguated the target
(i.e., one five was below an eight of spades and the other
was below and eight of clubs).
Participants always made an eye-movement to the target
card before reaching for it. We again found a clear point of
disambiguation effect. The mean latency of the eye-
movement that preceded the hand movement to the target
card (measured from a common point in the instruction)
increased monotonically with the point of disambiguation.
In addition, participants made sequences of eye-
movements which made it clear that interpretation was
taking place continuously. We quantified this by examining
the probability that the subject would be looking at (fixating
on) particular classes of cards during segments of the
instruction. For example, during the noun phrase that
introduced the potential targets, &amp;quot;the five of hearts&amp;quot;, nearly
all of the fixations were on one of the potential target cards.
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.9999682">
During the beginning of the relative clause &amp;quot;...that is below
the...&amp;quot; , most of the fixations were to one of the context
cards (i.e. the card that was above or below a potential
target card). Shortly after the disambiguating word, the
fixations shifted to the target card.

Contrastive focus
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999952838709678">
The presence of a circumscribed set of referents in a
visual model makes it possible to use eye-movements to
examine how presuppositional information associated with
intonation is used in on-line comprehension. [Sedivy,
Tanenhaus, Spivey-Knowlton, Eberhard &amp; Carlson, 1995]
For example, semantic analyses of contrast have converged
on a representation of contrastive focus which involves the
integration of presupposed and asserted information [e.g.,
Rooth, 1992; Kratzer, 1991; Krifka, 1991]. Thus a speaker
uttering &amp;quot;Computational linguists give good talks&amp;quot; is
making an assertion about computational linguists.
However, a speaker who says &amp;quot;COMPUTATIONAL
linguists give good talks.&amp;quot; is both complimenting the
community of computational linguists =1 making a
derogatory comparison with a presupposed set of
contrasting entities (perhaps the community of non-
computationally oriented linguists).
We explored whether contrast sets are computed on-line
by asking whether contrastive focus could be used to
disambiguate among potential referents, using a variation
on the point of disambiguation manipulation described
earlier. We used displays with objects that could differ
along three dimensions: size (large or small), color (red,
blue and yellow), and shape (circles, triangles and squares).
Each display contained four objects [see Sedivy et al., 1995
for details].
Consider now the display illustrated in Figure 2 which
contains a small yellow triangle, a large blue circle and two
red squares, one large and one small. With the instruction
&amp;quot;Touch the large red square.&amp;quot; the point of disambiguation
comes after &amp;quot;red&amp;quot; . After &amp;quot;large&amp;quot; there are still two possible
referents: the large red square and the large blue circle.
After &amp;quot;red&amp;quot; only the large red square is a possible referent..
However, with the instruction &amp;quot;Touch the LARGE red
square&amp;quot;, contrastive focus on &amp;quot;large&amp;quot; restricts felicitous
reference to objects that have a contrast member differing
along the dimension indicated by the contrast (size). In the
display in Figure 2, the small red square contrasts with the
large red square. However, the display does not contain a
contrast element for the large blue circle. Thus, if people
use contrastive stress to compute a contrast set on-line, then
they should have sufficient information to determine the
target object after hearing the size adjective Thus eye-
movements to the target object should be faster with
contrastive stress. That is, in fact, what we found.
Latencies to launch a saccade to the target were faster with
contrastive stress than with neutral stress.
However, there is a possible objection to an interpretation
invoking contrasts sets. One could argue that stress simply
focused participants&apos; attention on the size dimension,
allowing them to restrict attention to the large objects. To
rule out this alternative, we also included displays with two
contrast sets: e.g., two red squares, one large and one small,
and two blue circles, one large and one small. With a two
contrast display, contrastive focus is still felicitous.
However, the point of disambiguation now does not come
until after the color adjective for instructions with
contrastive stress and with neutral stress. Under these
conditions, we found no effect of contrast. The interaction
between type of display and stress provides clear evidence
that participants were computing contrast sets rapidly
enough to select among potential referents.

Word Recognition
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999884590909091">
The time course of spoken word recognition is strongly
influenced by both the properties of the word itself (e.g., its
frequency) and the set of words to which it is phonetically
similar. Recognition of a spoken word occurs shortly after
the auditory input uniquely specifies a lexical candidate
[Marslen-Wilson, 1987]. For polysyllabic words, this is
often prior to the end of the word. For example, the word
&amp;quot;elephant&amp;quot; would be recognized shortly after the &amp;quot;phoneme&amp;quot;
If/. Prior to that, the auditory input would be consistent with
the beginnings of several words, including &amp;quot;elephant&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;elegant&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;eloquent&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;elevator&amp;quot;.
Most models of spoken word recognition account for
these data by proposing that multiple lexical candidates are
activated as the speech stream unfolds. Recognition then
takes place with respect to the set of competing activated
candidates. However, models differ in how the candidate
set is defined. In some models, such as Marslen-Wilson&apos;s
classic Cohort model, competition takes place in a strictly
&amp;quot;left-to right&amp;quot; fashion. [Marslen-Wilson, 1987]. Thus the
competitor set for &amp;quot;paddle&amp;quot; would contain &amp;quot;padlock&amp;quot;, which
has the same initial phonemes as &amp;quot;paddle&amp;quot;, but would not
include a phonetically similar word that did not overlap in
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.980098">
50
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999867027027027">
its initial phonemes, such as a rhyming word like &amp;quot;saddle&amp;quot;.
In contrast, activation models such as TRACE [McClelland
&amp; Elman, 1986] assume that competition can occur
throughout the word and thus rhyming words would also
compete for activation.
Our initial experiments used real objects and instructions
such as &amp;quot;Pick up the candy&amp;quot;. We manipulated whether or
not the display contained an object with a name that began
with the same phonetic sequence as the target object
[Tanenhaus, Spivey-Knowlton, Eberhard &amp; Sedivy, 1995;
Spivey-Knowlton, Tanenhaus, Eberhard &amp; Sedivy, 1995].
Examples of objects with overlapping initial phonemes were
&amp;quot;candy&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;candle&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;doll&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;dolphin&amp;quot;. An eye-
movement to the target object typically began shortly after
the word ended, indicating that programming of the eye-
movement often began before the end of the word. The
presence of a competitor increased the latency of eye-
movements to the target and induced frequent false launches
to the competitor. The timing of these eye-movements
indicated that they were programmed during the
&amp;quot;ambiguous&amp;quot; segment of the target word. These results
demonstrated that the two objects with similar names were,
in fact, competing as the target word unfolded. Moreover,
they highlight the sensitivity of the eye-movement
paradigm.
In ongoing work, we are exploring more fine-grained
questions about the time-course of lexical activation. For
example, in an experiment in progress [Allopenna,
Magnuson &amp; Tanenhaus, 1996], the stimuli are line
drawings of objects presented on a computer screen (see
Figure 3). On each trial, participants are shown a set of four
objects and asked to &amp;quot;pick up&amp;quot; one of the objects with the
mouse and move it to a specified location on the grid. The
paddle was the target object for the trial shown in Figure 3.
The display includes a &amp;quot;cohort&amp;quot; competitor sharing initial
phonemes with the target (padlock) a rhyme competitor
(saddle) and an unrelated object (castle).

Figure 4 shows the probability that the eye is fixating on
the target and the cohort competitor as the spoken target
word unfolds. Early on in the speech stream, the eye is on
the fixation cross, where subjects are told to look at the
beginning of the trial. The probability of a fixation to the
target word and the cohort competitor then increases. As
the target word unfolds, the probability that the eye is
fixated on the target increases compared to the cohort
competitor. These data replicate our initial experiments and
show how eye-movements can be used to trace the time
course of spoken word recognition. Our preliminary data
also make it clear that rhyme competitors attract fixations,
as predicted by activation models.

Reference and Syntactic Ambiguity Resolution
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999786315789474">
There has been an unresolved debate in the language
processing community about whether there are initial stages
in syntactic processing that are strictly encapsulated from
influences of referential and pragmatic context. The
strongest evidence for encapsulated processing modules has
come from studies using sentences with brief syntactic
&amp;quot;attachment&amp;quot; ambiguities in which readers have clear
preferences for interpretations, associated with particular
syntactic configurations. For example, in the. instruction
&amp;quot;put the apple on the towel...,&amp;quot; people prefer to attach the
prepositional phrase &amp;quot;on the towel&amp;quot; to the verb &amp;quot;put&amp;quot;, rather
than the noun phrase &amp;quot;the apple&amp;quot;, thus interpreting it as the
argument of the verb (encoding the thematic relation of
Goal), rather than as a modifier of the noun.
If the instruction continues &amp;quot;Put the apple on the towel
into the box&amp;quot;, the initial preference for a verb-phrase
attachment is revealed by clear &amp;quot;garden-path&amp;quot; effects when
&amp;quot;into&amp;quot; is encountered. Encapsulated models account for this
preference in terms of principles such as pursue the simplest

attachment first, or initially attach a phrase as an argument
rather than as an adjunct. In contrast, constraint-based
models attribute these preferences to the strength of multiple
interacting constraints, including those provided by
discourse context. [For a recent review, see Tanenhaus and
Trueswell, 1995]
An influential proposal, most closely associated with
Crain and Steedman [1985], is that pragmatically driven
expectations about reference are an important source of
discourse constraint. For example, a listener hearing &amp;quot;put
the apple...&amp;quot; might reasonably assume that there is a single
apple and thus expect to be told where to put the apple (the
verb-phrase attachment). However, in a context in which
there was more than one apple, the listener might expect to
be told which of the apples is the intended referent and thus
prefer the noun phrase attachment.
Numerous experiments have investigated whether or not
the referential context established by a discourse context can
modify attachment preferences. These studies typically
introduce the context in a short paragraph and examine eye-
movements to the disambiguating words in a target
sentences containing the temporary ambiguity. While some
studies have shown effects of discourse context, others have
not. In particular, strong syntactic preferences persist
momentarily, even when the referential context introduced
by the discourse supports the normally less-preferred
attachment. For example, the preference to initially attach a
prepositional phrase to a verb requiring a goal argument
(e.g., &amp;quot;put&amp;quot;) cannot be overridden by linguistic context.
These results have been taken as strong evidence for an
encapsulated syntactic processing system.
However, typical psycholinguistic experiments may be
strongly biased against finding pragmatic effects on
syntactic processing. For example, the context may not be
immediately accessible because it has to be represented in
memory. Moreover, readers may not consider the context to
be relevant when the ambiguous region of the sentence is
being processed.
We reasoned that a relevant visual context that was
available for the listener to interrogate as the linguistic input
unfolded might influence initial syntactic analysis even
though the same information might not be effective when
introduced linguistically.
Sample instructions are illustrated by the examples in (1).
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.813625">
1. a. Put the apple on the towel in the box.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.993627565217392">
b. Put the apple that&apos;s on the towel in the box.
In sentence (la), the first prepositional phrase &amp;quot;on the
towel&amp;quot;, is ambiguous as to whether it modifies the noun
phrase (&amp;quot;the apple&amp;quot;) thus specifying the location of the
object to be picked up, or whether it modifies the verb, thus
introducing the goal location. In example (lb) the word
&amp;quot;that&apos;s&amp;quot; disambiguates the phrase as a modifier, serving as
an unambiguous control condition.
These instructions were paired with three types of display
contexts. Each context contained four sets of real objects
placed on a horizontal board. Sample displays for the
instructions presented in (1) are illustrated in Figures 5, 6,
and 7 Three of the objects were the same across all of the
displays. Each display contained the target object (an apple
on a towel) the correct goal, (a box) and an incorrect goal
(another towel). In the one referent display (Figure 4) there
was only one possible referent for the definite noun phrase
&amp;quot;the apple&amp;quot;, the apple on the towel. Upon hearing the phrase
&amp;quot;the apple&amp;quot;, participants can immediately identify the object
to be moved because there is only one apple and thus they
are likely to assume that &amp;quot;on the towel&amp;quot; is specifying the
goal. In the two-referent display (Figure 5), there was a
second possible referent (an apple on a napkin). Thus, &amp;quot;the
apple&amp;quot;, could refer to either of the two apples and the phrase
&amp;quot;on the towel&amp;quot; provides modifying information that specifies
which apple is the correct referent. Under these conditions a
listener seeking to establish reference should interpret the
prepositional phrase &amp;quot;on the towel&amp;quot; as providing
disambiguating inforination about the location of the apple.
In the three and one display, we added an apple cluster. The
uniqueness presupposition associated with the definite noun
phrase should bias the listener to assume that the single
apple (the apple on the towel) is the intended referent for the
theme argument. However, it is more felicitous to use a
modifier with this instruction. This display was used to test
if even a relatively subtle pragmatic effects will influence
syntactic processing
Strikingly different fixation patterns among the visual
contexts revealed that the ambiguous phrase &amp;quot;on the towel&amp;quot;
was initially interpreted as the goal in the one-referent
context but as a modifier in the two-referent contexts and
the three-and-one contexts [for details see Spivey-Knowlton
et al, 1995; Tanenhaus et al., 1995] In the one-referent
context, subjects looked at the incorrect goal (e.g., the
irrelevant towel) on 55% of the trials shortly after hearing
the ambiguous prepositional phrase, whereas they never
looked at the incorrect goal with the unambiguous
instruction. In contrast, when the context contained two
possible referents, subjects rarely looked at the incorrect
goal, and there were no differences between the ambiguous
and unambiguous instructions. Similar results obtained for
the three-and-one context.
Figures 5 and 6 summarize the most typical sequences of
eye-movements and their timing in relation to words in the
ambiguous instructions for the one-referent and the two-
referent contexts, respectively. In the one-referent context,
subjects first looked at the target object (the apple) 500 ms
after hearing &amp;quot;apple&amp;quot; then looked at the incorrect goal (the
towel) 484 ins after hearing &amp;quot;towel&amp;quot;. In contrast, with the
unambiguous instruction, the first look to a goal did not
OMIT until 500 ms after the subject heard the word &amp;quot;box&amp;quot;.
In the two-referent context, subjects often looked at both
apples, reflecting the fact that the referent of &amp;quot;the apple&amp;quot; was
temporarily ambiguous. Subjects looked at the incorrect
object on 42% of the unambiguous trials and on 61% of the
ambiguous trials. In contrast, in the one-referent context,
subjects rarely looked at the incorrect object (0% and 6% of
the trials for the ambiguous and unambiguous instructions,
respectively). In the two-referent context, subjects selected

the correct referent as quickly for the ambiguous instruction
as for the unambiguous instruction providing additional
evidence that the first prepositional phrase was immediately
interpreted as a modifier.
The three-and-one context provided additional
information. Typical sequences of eye-movements for this
context are presented in Figure 7. Participants rarely looked
at the apple cluster, making their initial eye-movement to
the apple on the towel. The next eye-movement was to the
box for both the ambiguous and unambiguous instruction.
These data also rule out a possible objection to the results
from the two referent condition. One could argue that
participants were, in fact, temporarily misparsing the
prepositional phrase as the goal. However, this misanalysis
might not be reflected in eye-movements to the towel
because the eye was already in transit, moving between the
two apples. However, in the three-and-one condition, the
eye remains on the referent throughout the prepositional
phrase. Given the sensitivity of eye-movements to
probabilistic information, e.g., false launches to cohort and
rhyme competitors, it is difficult to argue that the
participants experienced a temporary garden-path that was
too brief to influence eye-movements.

Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999995739130435">
We have reviewed results establishing that, with well-
defined tasks, eye-movements can be used to observe under
natural conditions the rapid mental processes that underlie
spoken language comprehension. We believe that this
paradigm will prove valuable for addressing questions on a
full spectrum of topics in spoken language comprehension,
ranging from the uptake of acoustic information during
word recognition to conversational interactions during
cooperative problem solving.
Our results demonstrate that in natural contexts people
interpret spoken language continuously, seeking to establish
reference with respect to their behavioral goals during the
earliest moments of linguistic processing. Thus our results
provide strong support for models that support continuous
interpretation. Our experiments also show that referentially
relevant non-linguistic information immediately affects how
the linguistic input is initially structured. Given these
results, approaches to language comprehension that
emphasize fully encapsulated processing modules are
unlikely to prove fruitful. More promising are approaches
in which grammatical constraints are integrated into
processing systems that coordinate linguistic and non-
linguistic information as the linguistic input is processed.

<abstract confidence="0.9865045625">We present an overview of recent work in which eye movements are monitored as people follow spoken instructions to move objects or pictures in a visual workspace. Subjects naturally make saccadic eye-movements to objects that are closely time-locked to relevant information in the instruction. Thus the eye-movements provide a window into the rapid mental processes that underlie spoken language comprehension. We review studies of reference resolution, word recognition, and pragmatic effects on syntactic ambiguity resolution. Our studies show that people seek to establish reference with respect to their behavioral goals during the earliest moments of linguistic processing. Moreover, referentially relevant non-linguistic information immediately affects how the linguistic input is initially structured.</abstract>

Participants in our experiments follow spoken instructions to touch or manipulate objects in a visual workspace while we monitor their eye-movements using a lightweight camera mounted on a headband. The camera, manufactured by Applied Scientific Laboratories, provides an infrared image of the eye at 60Hz. The center of the pupil and the corneal reflection are tracked to determine the orbit of the eye relative to the head. Accuracy is better than one degree of arc, with virtually unrestricted head and body movements [Ballard, Hayhoe, and Pelz, 1995]. Instructions are spoken into a microphone connected to a Hi-8 VCR.

Moreover, eyemovements were launched within 300 milliseconds of We end of the disambiguating word. It takes about 200 milliseconds from the point that an eye-movement is programmed until when the eye actually begins to move. On average then, participants began programming an eyemovement to the target block once they had heard the disambiguating word and Mug they had finished hearing the next word in the instruction. We used the same logic in an experiment with displays containing more objects and syntactically more complex instructions [Eberhard et al, 1995]. Participants were instructed to move miniature playing cards placed on slots on a 5X5 vertical board. Seven cards were displayed on each trial. A trial consisted of a sequence of three instructions. On the instructions of interest, there were two cards of the same suit and denomination in the display. The target card was disambiguated using a restrictive relative clause, e.g. &amp;quot;Put the five of hearts that is below the eight of clubs above the three of diamonds.&amp;quot; Figure 1 shows one of the displays for this instruction. to 3, o 84 5 5 Vs &amp;quot;Put the five of hearts that is below the eight of clubs</context>

The large circle is blue; the small triangle is yellow. Word Recognition The time course of spoken word recognition is strongly influenced by both the properties of the word itself (e.g., its frequency) and the set of words to which it is phonetically similar. Recognition of a spoken word occurs shortly after the auditory input uniquely specifies a lexical candidate [Marslen-Wilson, 1987]. For polysyllabic words, this is often prior to the end of the word. For example, the word &amp;quot;elephant&amp;quot; would be recognized shortly after the &amp;quot;phoneme&amp;quot; If/. Prior to that, the auditory input would be consistent with the beginnings of several words, including &amp;quot;elephant&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;elegant&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;eloquent&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;elevator&amp;quot;. Most models of spoken word recognition account for these data by proposing that multiple lexical candidates are activated as the speech stream unfolds. Recognition then takes place with respect to the set of competing activated candidates. However, models differ in how the candidate set is </context>

In some models, such as Marslen-Wilson&apos;s classic Cohort model, competition takes place in a strictly &amp;quot;left-to right&amp;quot; fashion. [Marslen-Wilson, 1987]. Thus the competitor set for &amp;quot;paddle&amp;quot; would contain &amp;quot;padlock&amp;quot;, which has the same initial phonemes as &amp;quot;paddle&amp;quot;, but would not include a phonetically similar word that did not overlap in 50 its initial phonemes, such as a rhyming word like &amp;quot;saddle&amp;quot;. In contrast, activation models such as TRACE [McClelland &amp; Elman, 1986] assume that competition can occur throughout the word and thus rhyming words would also compete for activation.

We used displays with objects that could differ along three dimensions: size (large or small), color (red, blue and yellow), and shape (circles, triangles and squares). Each display contained four objects [see Sedivy et al., 1995 for details].

Encapsulated models account for this preference in terms of principles such as pursue the simplest Probability 500 1000 1500 51 attachment first, or initially attach a phrase as an argument rather than as an adjunct. In contrast, constraint-based models attribute these preferences to the strength of multiple interacting constraints, including those provided by discourse context. [For a recent review, see Tanenhaus and Trueswell, 1995] An influential proposal, most closely associated with Crain and Steedman [1985], is that pragmatically driven expectations about reference are an important source of discourse constraint. For example, a listener hearing &amp;quot;put the apple...&amp;quot; might reasonably assume that there is a single apple and thus expect to be told where to put the apple (the verb-phrase attachment). However, in a context in which there was more than one apple, the listener might expect to be told which of the apples is the intended referent and thus prefer the noun phrase attachment.
