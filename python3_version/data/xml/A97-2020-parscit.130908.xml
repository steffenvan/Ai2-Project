BBN has developed a system, called VALAD (Voice-Activated Logistics An-
chor Desk), which provides a spoken language interface to a logistics information
system. Logistics experts can use their natural voice to ask for different types
of information or to control the display of the logistics system. The information
is displayed on a map or appears in tabular form, as is appropriate. The voice
interface is seamless in that the user can choose to use either voice or the tra-
ditional keyboard and mouse interface. However, the use of voice often allows
the user to short-cut many mouse clicks with a single query or command. The
1200-word VALAD is speaker independent, and runs completely in software on
off-the-shelf workstations.
VALAD was developed by BBN under the sponsorship of DARPA, the De-
fense Advanced Research Projects Agency, to demonstrate the applicability of
advanced speech recognition and language understanding technology to realistic
data base tasks. By enabling users to specify information in the database in nat-
ural English, VA LAD supports applications such as military planning processes
and enhances decision-support environments.
A formal experiment with VALAD (conducted by Major T. Bowman at the
Command and General Staff College at Ft. Leavenworth) concluded that users
could perform routine tasks in 1/3 the time using speech, compared to using the
keyboard and mouse. The users, all Army personnel, also thought that speech
would reduce training time because it was so easy to use.
VALAD was used at the Integrated Feasibility Demonstration at the JDEF
in Washington DC in June, 1996. VALAD was also used in the Prairie Warrior
&apos;96 military exercise at Ft. Leavenworth in May 1996.
