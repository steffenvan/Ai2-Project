This definition of synonymy provides us with a tool
to relate the words in the vocabulary of a language to
one another, and, hence, a tool with the aid of which we
can define all the word-uses of each word-sign simply
and in a form allowing comparisons of definitions. It can
be objected that if this approach is applied to special
vocabulary (technical and scientific terminology) in
which synonymy is rare, the definitions of word-uses
will often remain empty. The author analyzes various
potential classifications of sets of synonyms (sets of
rows) enabled by the synonymy definition, as well as
the possibilities of their groupings. She finds a few ways
of row grouping resulting in conceptual groupings sim-
ilar to those found in thesauri. She made a computer
experiment whose aim was to find out whether the
suggested procedure of grouping is practicable for the
natural language vocabulary. She selected 21 word-
signs and, on the basis of information about them
contained in the Oxford English Dictionary, assigned
500 rows to them (given in her Appendix 2). With aid of
the computer, she tried to establish groupings similar to
those in thesauri. The results have been satisfactory in
part only. After modifying classification criteria, the
author intended to carry out a new experiment involving
about 2,000 rows. The results of that experiment were
not mentioned in the chapter &amp;quot;Twenty years later&amp;quot;.
Sparck Jones is looking for an answer to the question
as to why we expect to find synonyms in natural
languages. She arrives at the conclusion that synonymy
is not a mere redundance and that it exists because, in
the extra-linguistic world, we encounter situations that
are unique, but, at the same time, similar to each other
in certain aspects. Synonymy reflects this fact; other-
wise language would be an inadequate representation of
the extra-linguistic world. She gives four models of the
way linguistic symbols are set up and she claims that her
Model 4 is the one that represents natural language:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.4489645">
Model 4:
a. A word-use may have more than one sign;
b. Two or more word-uses may have the same sign, where
these word-uses are similar. (p. 135)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.994118533333333">
It remains unclear why also homonymy, which is in-
cluded in her Model 2 and which does constitute a
language relation, is not dealt with in Model 4, and why
the word homonymy is never used in the book.
The book exemplifies an excellent way the efforts
made to solve practical problems in computational
linguistics bring new and promising knowledge in a field
of linguistic theory. The rendering of the subject has a
solid, logical structure; it is clear and systematic. The
text is not burdened with the artificial linguistic termi-
nology that flooded the linguistic publications of the
sixties. It can be regretted that the book was not
published at the time of its origin. Even for the present
time, however, it yields a number of suggestions for
linguistic research.

Reasoning and Discourse Processes is a collection of
papers in the Cognitive Science series of Academic
Press. The authors are largely from psychology and
linguistics departments in the U.K. and Europe.
The book begins with a brief preface, which clearly sets
out the theme of the book: exploring the relation
between verbal reasoning and discourse, with an aim of
contributing to an adequate theory of natural language
processing. The very first chapter of the book, written
by the editors, serves to describe how the different
authors address the theme mentioned in the preface.
This chapter is an excellent summary of the upcoming
chapters, providing the reader with an index into those
parts of the book of most interest to his/her own
research.
The editors divide the papers into two main topics:
forms of representation and the role of inference for
reasoning within discourse. The first six chapters dis-
cuss representation: &amp;quot;whether rules of inference for-
malized in a logical calculus adequately characterize the
deductive component of the verbal reasoning capac-
ity&amp;quot;. The remaining chapters are primarily concerned
with characterizations of coherence; these consider-
ations may introduce a deductive component into dis-
course.
The book thus addresses issues of concern to com-
putational linguists. Constructing models for the proc-
essing of natural language requires considerations both
of the form of the representation and the inferencing

required to build the representation. Characterizations
of coherence may be useful in controlling the analysis,
and considering the form of reasoning underlying the
discourse may help to characterize the form. As the
book focuses on discourse, particular issues such as
reference resolution and the maxims of conversation are
highlighted. There are in fact particular questions ad-
dressed in some of the chapters which are especially
relevant to certain computational linguistics research
efforts.
The first three chapters present conceptions of the
form of reasoning underlying discourse, especially ar-
guments. These papers are relevant to computational
linguists involved in constructing models for the analy-
sis of discourse. Johnson-Laird argues that logical form
has no role in accounting for deductive competence.
Connectives and quantifiers do not merit a special
treatment; people need only know the truth conditions
of these terms in order to make deductions. In another
chapter, Moore presents some evidence for induction as
a model of reasoning. In contrast, Allwood-claims that
speakers share a normative intuition, following tradi-
tional logic, of the shape of an argument. He contributes
some insights as well into the role of utterance-level
intentions in discourse structure. Hagert and Waern
present some insight into the form of invalid plans
underlying discourse. They comment on the need to
distinguish inferences underlying actual sentences from
those used for inferencing (i.e., the point of view of the
observer and the speaker).
The last three chapters of the book, by Kempson,
Wilson and Sperber, and Wilks, present an interesting
discussion of the procedures for discourse processing.
Kempson draws on some suggestions of Wilson and
Sperber to discuss the relationship between semantic
and pragmatic processing, with an application to ana-
phora resolution. She proposes a mapping from surface
structure to a logical form, which then interacts with a
pragmatic, relevance-driven rule of antecedent identifi-
cation. Wilson and Sperber address the use of &amp;quot;rele-
vance&amp;quot; to utterance-level analysis, which is seen as a
process of hypothesis formation. Wilks then criticizes
Sperber and Wilson for failing to distinguish beliefs of
conversants, in interpreting inference in discourse.
In general, the collection is a useful reference. My
main negative comment is that some of the papers do
not include enough examples (which would be emi-
nently useful for people constructing implementations),
and as a result end up appearing too general, too
superficial. But on the whole I continue to have faith
that dialog between cognitive scientists (psychologists,
linguists) and computer science researchers is possible,
even for those computer science people without the aim
of having a cognitively accurate model of human proc-
essing. The class of input to process can be made
clearer, and intuitions for the characterizations of proc-
essing models can be provided.

argument and discourse. Cohen&apos;s address is: Department of

The glib freedom with which we use the word informa-
tion would lead one to suppose we know what we are
talking about. Alas, not so. In a field that concerns itself
with &amp;quot;information processing&amp;quot;, it is remarkable if not
embarrassing that there is still, after 40 years, no
generally accepted, coherent definition of information
to underwrite the enterprise.
It is well known that information theory is not
concerned with the information content or meanings of
particular texts or utterances. It interprets certain mea-
sures of probability or uncertainty in an ensemble of
signal sequences (which may indeed be meaningless) as
a metric of the difficulty of transmitting a given signal
sequence, and then calls this metric, in a notoriously
misleading way, the &amp;quot;amount of information&amp;quot; in the
signal.&apos;
Carnap and Bar-HilleI2 announced long ago what was
essentially a ramification of Carnap&apos;s work in inductive
logic and probability, a Theory of Semantic Information
dealing solely with linguistic entities (&amp;quot;state descrip-
tions&amp;quot; in some logical language) and what they stand for
or designate. Carnap&apos;s aim was to devise measures of
&amp;quot;semantic content&amp;quot; that would enable him to get at
&amp;quot;confirmation functions&amp;quot; to underwrite inductive logic.
Bar-Hillel&apos;s initial enthusiasm was to develop a perhaps
broader &amp;quot;calculus of information.&amp;quot; Although the ban-
ner they dropped was taken up in the &apos;60s by Hintikka
and others,3 it is safe to say that this line of thought has
contributed little to a satisfactory definition of informa-
tion.
Today, we witness the spectacle of Dretske and the
situation semantics folks4 mounted precariously on the
Scylla of naive realism, tilting with Fodor atop the
Charybdis of a mental representationalism that is philo-
sophically more sophisticated but no less ad hoc in its
misuse of metaphor.5 Unfortunately, a summary of the
well-deserved doubt that each casts upon the merits of
the other&apos;s case is beyond the scope of this review.
