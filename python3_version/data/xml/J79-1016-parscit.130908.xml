purpose of this paper is to present a synthesis and clarification
of established methods so as to encourage other computational lin-
guists to tackle digital speech synthesis. The approach is semi-
tutorial: crucial algorithms are given in Fortran or block-diagram
form, and bibliographic references that were found to be most
useful in the system development are listed and discussed.
The system described requires a minimum of hardware; a mini-
computer is sufficient, if it is equipped with tape or disk
secondary memory. The sound pressure wave is calculated entirely
by software and only a digital-to-analog converter and a low-pass
filter. are .required to convert it to a recordable electrical signal.
The vocal apparatus is simulated by a rough model which is still
general enough to make most speech sounds. The two main types of
excitation of the vocal tract -- periodic glottal waves for voicing
and random noise for frication or aspiration -- are supplied by
algorithms presented as function subroutines. The effect of the
vocal tract on these inputs is modelled by combinations of three
other elemental functions, whose coding is based on recursive equa-
tion theory for computational efficiency. A resonance provides the
user with a means for accentuating the signal at a certain frequen-
cy, such as a formant frequency of a vowel; an anti-resonance or
notch filter is provided to cut back the energy at a certain fre-
quency, as in simulation of the nasal anti-formant; and a radiation-
effect subroutine simulates the effect on the speech signal of
passage from the lips through a short stretch of air. Empirically
obtained wave shapes and spoctra of the outputs of these five basic
functions are given in order to give the reader a better feel for
what they do.
These five elements can be combined in a number of ways.
A detailed discussion is given for one of the simplest reasonable
models, in which the glottal wave and frication generators excite
a series of three variable resonators, using a set of fixed reso-
nances to simulate higher frequency formants in addition to the
radiation-effect simulator. Several other more complex arrangements
are presented, including parallel resonator models and models with
separate filters for shaping voiced, fricative, and nasal components,
and their advantages and disadvantages are discussed.
An example is given of a complete modular Fortran program
generating the word &amp;quot;seat&amp;quot;. The equations for specifying the param-
eters controlling the elemental functions were derived, with much
effort, from analysis of or token utterance, and spectrographs of
the real and synthetic words are shown to illustrate the degree of
naturalness obtainable with the simple three-resonator series model.
A simpler example for generating a constant vowel sound is also
given, along with a summary of data useful in making many vowels.

Several years ago, it was decided that the Research Depart-
ment at Central Institute for the, Deaf in St. Louis should have
a- digital speech synthesizer to aid studies in psychoacousticeP
and phonetic perception. The equipment on hand at the time
consisted primarily of a 12-bit-word mini-computer with keyboard
and scope, with special-purpose hardware for doing digital-to-
analog conversion, low-pass filtering, and floating-point
arithmetic More peripheral devices and core memory have now
blt.en added. We have been working since then on writing digital
computer programs to synthesize speech studying the literature
and gaining practical experience.
Almost all of the theory and techniques necessary to program
the synthesis of English sounds oan be found in published literature,
but in bits and pleces, here and there. Utilizing the contributions
of many authors, plus our own experience, we present and explain
a basic program or synthesizing speech, in the hope that computa-
tional lingUists who have not worked with low-level speech phenomena
may be encouraged to program synthesizers.
The use of synthetic-speech stimuli has been extremely import-
ant to the investigation of the perceptually ,distinctive features
of speech and of low-level phonological rules, but much work remains
undone. Synthesizing speech is clearly important to phonetic
research, and the field could well use mare researchers with
linguistic training. The system described in this paper requires
relatively small investments in equipment and programming.
II. Overview
Synthesizers use varying amounts of special-purpose hardware.
The type of synthesis we describe here uses the bare minimum,
calculating the speech wave on a digital computer and requiring
only a digital-to-analog converter and a low-pass analog filter
as special. hardware. This minimum set of equipment is shown in

storage is available, then a 4 k 12-bit-word mini-computer is suffic-
iently large, and a 12-bit D/A converter.will give enough dynamic
range.
Once the speech wave is generated and stored on tape or
disk, there is a problem of writing a program to output enough
of it synchronously at a fast enough rate. We will not go
further into this problem here, since the solution will depend
on the particular machine installation you have. Whatever output
sample rate you achieve, there are two things to note: the
analog low-pass filter should pass only frequencies below
the output sample rate, and the output sample rate is a parameter
whose value must be fed into the digital calbulations.
Although our synthesizer can be described as a terminal
analog model of the vocal apparatus, the attitude we take is
that our method of synthesis is used rather to produce the aig-
nificant acoustic features of speech. To set the stage for an
understanding of the synthesizer presented here, and for the
benefit of those not familiar with acoustic phonetics, let us
review for a minute what we are synthesizing.

and darker marks indicate more energy. The mottled area at
the upper left is the qUasi-random noise of the /s/ sound.
To make other fricatives, such as /f/, we need to alter the
frequency spectrum and intensity of the noise. The dark
horizontal bands in the center are concentrations of energy
-- resonances called &amp;quot;formants&amp;quot; charactetistic of vowel
sounds. To make different vowels, we Leed to change the
center frequencies, bandwidths, and relative intensities of
the three lower formants visible here. There are higher-
frequency formants, which do not show up well in this spectro-
gram, but they seem to be important only to the naturalness
of the speech, not to which vowel is perceived. Note the
beginning and ending slopes of the formants; these formant
transitions are crucial to the perception of occlusive con-
sonants such as the stops /b/, /d/, and /g/, And finally, the
vertical mark at the tar right is a burst ot noise marking the
release of the final consonant,
The detailed algorithms we present here will be expressed
in Fortran for clarity, although the synthesizer with which
we have had the most experience is coded in assembly language.
We are presently converting to Fortran, and the subroutines
and final example program listed in this paper have been tested
in their Fortran form.
Before we get into details of synthesis, consider the
overall logic, Figure 3, page 9. The main thing to.note ix

Natural glottal waves, while subject to much variation, are
usually considered to consist of three parts: a glottis-opening
phase in which the volume velocity is increasing, a glottis-closing
phase in which the volume velocity is decreasing, and a glottis-
closed phase in which the volume velocity is zero. The spectrum of
such waves is supposed to fall off at about 10 to 12 dB/octave,1

and a theoretical spectral analysis of a linear approximation shows
regular lobes sdperimposed on this spectrum) We have just begun
to study natural glottal waves in our Research Department, and while
no definite results can be reported yet, Figure 4, page 12, shows
the wave shape and spectral analysis of one typical male glottal
wave period, The opening and closing phases will be more apparent
if the wave is considered to begin and end at the minimum value
instead of a zero value as our analysis program has done. There
does not appear to be a closed phase of the wave, but this is bne
of the variations reported in the literature.

tions to glottal waves: in the first, an impulse is generated
and fed into appropriate spectral shaping filters,2 while in the
second, a standard wave shape is used as a pattern for each
glottal pulse.3 We chose the second method, because Rosenberg
has shown that some simple wave shapes produce synthetic speech
that sounds natural,4 and the method semed conceptually cleaner.
Rosenberg studied the naturalness of speech synthesized
from a number of different wave shapes used as glottal pulses.
We have used two of his shapes in our work: the linear (called
by some &amp;quot;triangular&amp;quot;) and the polynomial approximations. Of the
shapes he studied, the linear requires the least amount of

execution time and the polynomial scored the highest in his
tests of naturalness. Figure 5, page 14, shows the wave shape
and spectrum of a linear approximation and Figure 6, page 14,
shows that of a polynomial approximation. The over-all falloff
of the spectrum of the polynomial more nearly matches our example
wave, but no lobes are apparent, as they are in the spectra of
the linear approximation and the natural example. Judging
from some informal listening tests we have made, these dis-
tinctions do not seem to make a great difference: both approx-
imations sound good.
As Figure 7, page 15, we present a Fortran function
GLOT(P,AV) for generating glottal waves using the polynomial
approximation. Values of pitch (P) and zero-to-peak amplitude
(AV) are passed directly as control parameters.
The subroutine uses the common area to store several variables,
which or course could be declared as formal parameters instegd.
ISWV is a voicing switch used in the logic internal to GLOT.
TDEL is the period between output sample points in milliseconds;
in the over-all initialization of the program, its value should
be calculated as 1000.0/0SR, where OSR is the output sample
rate in samples per second. TG is a variable used as a simulated
time clock by GILT, keeping track of how far through the glottal
wave it has gone. TP, T1, and T2 are durations (in milliseconds)
from the beginning or tne glottal pulse, calculated and used by
GUN&apos;: TP is the duration of the pulse, Ti is the duration of
the opening phase, and T2 is the duration of the opening and
closing pnases combined. OPTR (an acronym far &amp;quot;opening time

and CLTR is the fraction occupied by closing. In the over-all
initialization, OPT R should be set to .40 and CLTR to .16, values
which maximize naturalness according to Rosenberg&apos;s paper.
If the instantaneous values of AV mere used by GLOT, the
standard wave shape would be altered if AV were changing during
generation of a glottal wave. To keep the wave shape constant,
GLOT uses the variable AVSAVE to store the value of AV at the
beginning of each pitch period, and during the generation of
the pulse, AVSAVE is used as the (constant) amplitude.
Between calls to GLOT, the values of ISWV, TG, TP, Ti, T2,
and AVSAVE should not be altered,
Rosenberg&apos;s equations for the polynomial approximation
are used in GLOT; to get the linear approximation, the follow-
ing two lines of Fortran should be substituted in GLOT for
lines number 60 and 64:
140 YAVSAVE*(TG/T1)
160 Y=AVSAVE*(1.0-(TG-T1)/(T2-T1))

2. White Noise Generator
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.984330384615385">
Almost any reasonably good random-number generator can
be used as a source of white noise. If the spectrum of the
random numbers produced is flat, it will be easier to shape
into the desired spectra for the different fricative sounds.
The algorithm we use was developed for use in synthetic
speech work; it is very fast, and produces noise with a quite
flat spectrum. Its presentation by Rader, Rabiner, Schafer,
17.
and Perry1 is easy to follow and implement. The logic of the
algorithm is formally stated in Fortran in Figure 8, page 18,
hut if possible this should be one function coded in assembly
language: if the right machine instructions are available,
it will be a snap, but &amp;quot;bit fiddling&amp;quot; in Fortran is very slow.
Our function IRN4(X) -- X is a dummy variable required
by our Fortran compUer -- contains this algorithm in assembly
language, producing on successive calls a series of random
numbers with a uniform distribution over the interval from
-2047 to +2047. To implement a white noise generator, only this
line of coding is needed:
Y=AN*(FLOAT(IRN4(X))/2047.0)
where AN is a variable whose value is the amplitude of noise
desired.
A typical stretch of noise produced in this manner, along
with its spectrum, is given as Figure 9, page 19. Note that
there does not appear to be any significant deviation from
flatness in the spectrum intensity.

resonant filters are used to make *Ehe formants of voiced speech
and, in a rather strained fashion, to shape the noise spectrum
during frication and aspiration.
All of the elements in this figure should now be familiar
except the one called &amp;quot;higher otder correction filter.&amp;quot; This is
a series of resonant filters of fixed center frequency and
bandwidth which compensate for the effect of higher-frequency
resonances present in a real vocal tract but absent in a digital
simulation of this kind. Their use is discussed in Rabiner (&apos;1968i
from which the values presented in Figure 16, page 27, were taken.
These are the values to use for center frequency and bandwidth of
the higher order correcting filters. Only higher-order filters
with center frequency less than i the output sample rate should be
used. The recursive equation coefficients AO, Al, and A2 need &apos;12e
calculated only once, in the over-all initialization.
Theoretically, the cader of computation of the series elements
such as those in the main stem of Model T, makes no difference.
However, because the digital numbers are finite in length round-off
or truncation errors are introduced at each step of the computation
The overall error increases afl the number of computational steps
increase. Some types of computation such as differentiation tend
to increase the error, while other types such as integration tend
to uecrease -Erie error. For this reason, overall system error is
related in a complex way to the order of computation. An understandin
of error buildup and testing of the various algorithms will help in
choosing the computational sequence that results in smallest errors
In the case of cascaded resonators. it is better to perform the
computation in reverse order from that implied by Fig. 15 - radia-
tion effect first, then higher order filters in descending center
frequency order, then formant filters.

In the Model T organization, nine control parameters are avail-

and the center frequency and bandwidth of three variable formant
filters. In the main loop, just before generating the next speech
wave point, a subroutine (it can be in-line code, of course) calcu-
lating values of these parameters is needed. If at the beginning
of the program the variable T (time) is initialized to zero
and incremented by TDEL at the end of the main loop, it can serve
as a simulated-time clock on which to base calculation of ihe,
control parameters. The simplest method of control is to formu-
late the desired control parameter curves algebraically and just

to 100 Hz in the next 100 msec and stay at that value from then on.

When new values of CF and BW are computed for the three
variable formant filters, subroutine COEFF should be called to
translate these into the coefficients AO, Al, and A2 actually
used by function RES.
If new valUes of tr control parameters are calculated every
sample point, the execution time of the program will be very long

One way is to calculate new values for P and AV only at

One model used in some synthesizers is the parallel
formant model, whose block diagram is given as Figure 18,
page 32. In serial formant models such as Model T, no
independent control of the relative iretensities of formants
is possible, since the order of operations is immaterial. It
has been shown that the relative intensities of formants in a
serial synthesis closely match those found in natural speech,1
which is some justification of the serial model as an analog
of the vocal tract. But in a parallel formant arrangement, each
parallel channel must have a separate gain control. This is fine
if you&apos;re investigating the perception of relative formant intens-
ities, but not many have chosen this model for general speech
synthesis

A separee channel is devoted to noise, with its own resonant

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.887744470588235">
Model T does not use anti-resonances; they are not typical
of voiced speech, but rather are present in the spectra of
fricatives and nasalized segments. For making nasal sounds, a
parallel nasal channel whose input is the glottal wave and whose
output is added in just before the radiance effect calculation
can be added. The spectral shaping filters needed in this channel
are not obvious from published reports, but one variable anti-
resonance and several fixed resonances are probably a minimum
complement.
A, multitude of more complex models can be seen in the litera-
ture -- Rabiner (1968), to take one example, includes a special
drrangement for generating voiced fricatives.

Figure 21, page 44. Deriving the parameter curves from the
token utterance took a lot of work, but as Figure 21 shows, the
resulting synthetic word is a reasonably close copy of the original.
For those who may want to use, this program as a beginning to
their work, several features of it will be explained.
The basic model used is the simplest, model Hilt&apos; (Figure 15,
page 25) with one addition: the noise signal is multiplied by a
relative gain constant (GFRIC) before entering the vocal tract
(variable filter) section.
The output sound wave is stored a block at a time in file
RAPWRKI. This file is opened by the subroutine called in line 43
written into in line 455, and closed in line 470.
Parameter values are periodically calculated from piece-
wise polynomial algebraic specifications in the section called
l&apos;GPARII, lines 142 to 415. The periods between parameter
re-calculations are controlled by two variables serving as
clocks, TVOC for voicing parameters and TFRIC for frication
parameters. The values of PVOC and PFRIC are the times in msec
between re-calculations of vocalic and fricative parameter values,
respectively. These parameter values can be reset more often by
merely changing the values assigned to PVOC and PFRIC in lines
.33 and 37; at present frication parameters are reset every
0.1 msec and vocalic parameters every 0.2 msec. The Fortran
logic calculating the parameters was coded for clarity, not econ-
omy, and though lengthy should be easy to follow. The primitive
subroutine TPOW returns powers of a variable for ease in calcu-
lating polynomial functions of time: after calling TPOW(T,N,TX)
TX(l)=T-, TX(2)=T2, TX(N)=TN
Certain parameters are constant during some of the sounds,
e.g., spectral parameters during &amp;quot;S&amp;quot;. As a minor concession to
execution speed, these constant parameters are not reset after
the first entry into the section during which they are constant
The variables ISW1, ISW, and I3W3 are &apos;first-time-through&amp;quot;
switches, used to remember whether or not the temporarily
constant parametets have been calculated yet.
We have found that duplicating a token of natural speech
using this simple basic synthesis model, though possible, can
be quite difficult, requiring much trial-and-error work.
Fortunately, much research on speech perception does not require
exact duplication of given utterances, but instead uses simpler
sets of parameter curves. An example of such a program, which
synthesizes the vowel /i/ with constant pitch and intensity can
be made by substituting the following code for the °GPAR° Section,
lines 151 to 411 of the sample program.

<bodyText confidence="0.907242608695652">
The simple schemes for speech synthesis presented here are
sufficient to make speech containing most of the sounds of English.
Figure 22, page 45, is a handy reference containing char-
acteristics of English vowels from several primary sources,
assembled in tabtlar form by Dunn as part of his section of
Automatic Syeech Recognition (1963). Since this reference is
not easily available, the primary sources of Dunn&apos;s data are also
listed in the bibliography. The fundamental and three formant
frequencies for men, women, and children were taken from Peterson
and Barney (1952). The three formant amplitudes for each vowel
are also from the Peterson and Barney measurements, but averaged
over all three classes of speakers. Dunn took the relative
strengths of the first formants of the different vowels from the
measurements Of Sacia and Beck (1926), as qu9ted by Fletcher (1953)
arbitrarily assigning the zero deCibel level to the strongest
vowel,[ The three formant bandwidths are the average of
three sets given by Fant (1962), one set his -own measurements,
one those of House and Stevens, and the third m-easured by Dunn
himself (1961). Dunn cautions that the bandwidths vary widely
among individual speakers.
These values of center frequency and bandwidth of formants
for the different vowels can be used as variable formant filter
control parameters in Model T with unimpeachable results.

<abstract confidence="0.975919220779221">Relatively simple computer methods for synthesizing speech to used in phonetic/perceptual research are presented, references to the problems and successes encountered in the development of such a system at Cettral InstitUte for the Deaf and the Biomedical Computer Laboratory of Washington University. The purpose of this paper is to present a synthesis and clarification of established methods so as to encourage other computational linguists to tackle digital speech synthesis. The approach is semitutorial: crucial algorithms are given in Fortran or block-diagram and bibliographic references that were found most useful in the system development are listed and discussed. The system described requires a minimum of hardware; a minicomputer is sufficient, if it is equipped with tape or disk secondary memory. The sound pressure wave is calculated entirely software and only a converter and a low-pass filter. are .required to convert it to a recordable electrical signal. is simulated by a rough model which is still to make most speech sounds. The two main types of excitation of the vocal tract -periodic glottal waves for voicing and random noise for frication or aspiration -are supplied by presented as The effect of tract on these modelled by combinations of three other elemental functions, whose coding is based on recursive equation theory for computational efficiency. A resonance provides the with a means for accentuating the signal at a certain frequenas a formant of a vowel; an anti-resonance filter is provided to cut back the energy a certain freas in simulation of the nasal and a radiationsubroutine simulates the on speech signal of passage from the lips through a short stretch of air. Empirically obtained wave shapes and spoctra of the outputs of these five basic given in order to give the reader better feel for what they do. five elements can be combined in a of ways. discussion is for one of the reasonable models, in which the glottal wave and frication generators excite series of three variable resonators, using a fixed resoto higher frequency formants in addition to radiation-effect simulator. Several other more complex arrangements presented, parallel resonator models models with filters shaping voiced, fricative, and nasal components, and their advantages and disadvantages are discussed. is given of modular Fortran program generating the word &amp;quot;seat&amp;quot;. The equations for specifying the parameters controlling the elemental functions were derived, with much effort, from analysis of or token utterance, and spectrographs of real and synthetic words are shown to the degree of obtainable with the simple three-resonator series example for generating a constant vowel sound is also given, along with a summary of data useful in making many vowels. paper is a slightly expanded version of one orally the,12th annual meeting in Amherst Massaahusetts.

The glottal wave generator and noise generator produce sounds whose spectra are then shaped by combinations of the other elements. A. Sources 1. Glottal-Wave Generator Natural glottal waves, while subject to much variation, are usually considered to consist of three parts: a glottis-opening phase in which the volume velocity is increasing, a glottis-closing phase in which the volume velocity is decreasing, and a glottisclosed phase in which the volume velocity is zero. The spectrum of such waves is supposed to fall off at about 10 to 12 dB/octave,1 Cf. Flanagan (1958) 11. and a theoretical spectral analysis of a linear approximation shows regular lobes sdperimposed on this spectrum) We have just begun to study natural glottal waves in our Research Department, and while no definite results can be reported yet, Figure 4, page 12, shows the wave shape and spectral analysis of one typical male glottal wave period, The opening and closing phases will be more apparent if the wave is considered to begin and end at the minimum value instead of a zero value as our analysis program has done.

(1973) is a clear presentation, with some more general Fortran algorithms than will be given here. Figure 10, page 21, gives one Fortran subroutine and two Fortran functions which we use to simulate resonant and anti-resonant tilters. The functions RES and ARES return the outiput values of simple resonant (conjugate pole pair) and anti-resonant (con jugate zero pair) filters, respectively. AO, Al, and A2 are coefficients used in the recursive equations. YM1 and YM2 are remembered previous values of the signal, and Y is the input to the filter. AO. Al, and A2 determine the characteristics of the filt</context>

It has been shown that the relative intensities of formants in a serial synthesis closely match those found in natural speech,1 which is some justification of the serial model as an analog of the vocal tract. But in a parallel formant arrangement, each parallel channel must have a separate gain control. This is fine if you&apos;re investigating the perception of relative formant intensities, but not many have chosen this model for general speech synthesis Rabiner (1968) contains a worthwhile discussion of the relative merits of serial and parallel synthesis.2 If you decide to try a parallel formant model, the higher order correcting filters are apparently unnecessary, and Rabiner (1968) mentions that zeros -- anti-resonances -- are introduced into the spectrum. 2. Separate Noise Shaping Channel In Model T, the same three filters are used to make the formants or voiced speech and to shape the spectrum of noise during unvoiced speech. This is cumbersome and difficult, and a simple alternative is illustrated in Figure 19, page 34. 1. Pant (1956) 2. so does Flan</context>

For making nasal sounds, a parallel nasal channel whose input is the glottal wave and whose output is added in just before the radiance effect calculation can be added. The spectral shaping filters needed in this channel are not obvious from published reports, but one variable antiresonance and several fixed resonances are probably a minimum complement. A, multitude of more complex models can be seen in the literature -- Rabiner (1968), to take one example, includes a special drrangement for generating voiced fricatives. D.
