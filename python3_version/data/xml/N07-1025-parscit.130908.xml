1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999805894736842">
Ambiguity is inherent to human language. In partic-
ular, word sense ambiguity is prevalent in all natural
languages, with a large number of the words in any
given language carrying more than one meaning.
For instance, the English noun plant can mean green
plant or factory; similarly the French word feuille
can mean leaf or paper. The correct sense of an am-
biguous word can be selected based on the context
where it occurs, and correspondingly the problem of
word sense disambiguation is defined as the task of
automatically assigning the most appropriate mean-
ing to a polysemous word within a given context.
Among the various knowledge-based (Lesk,
1986; Galley and McKeown, 2003; Navigli and Ve-
lardi, 2005) and data-driven (Yarowsky, 1995; Ng
and Lee, 1996; Pedersen, 2001) word sense dis-
ambiguation methods that have been proposed to
date, supervised systems have been constantly ob-
served as leading to the highest performance. In
these systems, the sense disambiguation problem
is formulated as a supervised learning task, where
each sense-tagged occurrence of a particular word
is transformed into a feature vector which is then
used in an automatic learning process. Despite their
high performance, these supervised systems have an
important drawback: their applicability is limited to
those few words for which sense tagged data is avail-
able, and their accuracy is strongly connected to the
amount of labeled data available at hand.
To address the sense-tagged data bottleneck prob-
lem, different methods have been proposed in the
past, with various degrees of success. This includes
the automatic generation of sense-tagged data using
monosemous relatives (Leacock et al., 1998; Mi-
halcea and Moldovan, 1999; Agirre and Martinez,
2004), automatically bootstrapped disambiguation
patterns (Yarowsky, 1995; Mihalcea, 2002), paral-
lel texts as a way to point out word senses bear-
ing different translations in a second language (Diab
and Resnik, 2002; Ng et al., 2003; Diab, 2004),
and the use of volunteer contributions over the Web
(Chklovski and Mihalcea, 2002).
In this paper, we investigate a new approach for
building sense tagged corpora using Wikipedia as a
source of sense annotations. Starting with the hy-
perlinks available in Wikipedia, we show how we
can generate sense annotated corpora that can be
used for building accurate and robust sense clas-
sifiers. Through word sense disambiguation ex-
periments performed on the Wikipedia-based sense
tagged corpus generated for a subset of the SENSE-
VAL ambiguous words, we show that the Wikipedia
annotations are reliable, and the quality of a sense
tagging classifier built on this data set exceeds by a
large margin the accuracy of an informed baseline
that selects the most frequent word sense by default.
The paper is organized as follows. We first pro-

view of Wikipedia as a sense tagged corpus. We then

can be used to derive sense annotated corpora, and
we show how a word sense disambiguation system

Wikipedia is a free online encyclopedia, represent-
ing the outcome of a continuous collaborative effort
of a large number of volunteer contributors. Virtu-
ally any Internet user can create or edit a Wikipedia
webpage, and this “freedom of contribution” has a
positive impact on both the quantity (fast-growing
number of articles) and the quality (potential mis-
takes are quickly corrected within the collaborative
environment) of this online resource. Wikipedia edi-
tions are available for more than 200 languages, with
a number of entries varying from a few pages to
more than one million articles per language.1
The basic entry in Wikipedia is an article (or
page), which defines and describes an entity or an
event, and consists of a hypertext document with hy-
perlinks to other pages within or outside Wikipedia.
The role of the hyperlinks is to guide the reader to
pages that provide additional information about the
entities or events mentioned in an article.
Each article in Wikipedia is uniquely referenced
by an identifier, which consists of one or more words
separated by spaces or underscores, and occasion-
ally a parenthetical explanation. For example, the
article for bar with the meaning of “counter for
drinks” has the unique identifier bar (counter).2
The hyperlinks within Wikipedia are created us-
ing these unique identifiers, together with an an-
chor text that represents the surface form of the hy-
perlink. For instance, “Henry Barnard, [[United
StatesjAmerican]] [[educationalist]], was born in
[[Hartford, Connecticut]]” is an example of a sen-
tence in Wikipedia containing links to the articles
United States, educationalist, and Hartford, Con-
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.999666">
1In the experiments reported in this paper, we use a down-
load from March 2006 of the English Wikipedia, with approxi-
mately 1 million articles, and more than 37 millions hyperlinks.
2The unique identifier is also used to form the article URL,
e.g. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar (counter)
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.998149903225806">
necticut. If the surface form and the unique iden-
tifier of an article coincide, then the surface form
can be turned directly into a hyperlink by placing
double brackets around it (e.g. [[educationalist]]).
Alternatively, if the surface form should be hyper-
linked to an article with a different unique identi-
fier, e.g. link the word American to the article on
United States, then a piped link is used instead, as in
[[United StatesjAmerican]].
One of the implications of the large number of
contributors editing the Wikipedia articles is the
occasional lack of consistency with respect to the
unique identifier used for a certain entity. For in-
stance, the concept of circuit (electric) is also re-
ferred to as electronic circuit, integrated circuit,
electric circuit, and others. This has led to the so-
called redirect pages, which consist of a redirection
hyperlink from an alternative name (e.g. integrated
circuit) to the article actually containing the descrip-
tion of the entity (e.g. circuit (electric)).
Finally, another structure that is particularly rel-
evant to the work described in this paper is the
disambiguation page. Disambiguation pages are
specifically created for ambiguous entities, and con-
sist of links to articles defining the different mean-
ings of the entity. The unique identifier for a dis-
ambiguation page typically consists of the paren-
thetical explanation (disambiguation) attached to
the name of the ambiguous entity, as in e.g. cir-
cuit (disambiguation) which is the unique identifier
for the disambiguation page of the entity circuit.

3 Wikipedia as a Sense Tagged Corpus
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998748">
A large number of the concepts mentioned in
Wikipedia are explicitly linked to their correspond-
ing article through the use of links or piped links.
Interestingly, these links can be regarded as sense
annotations for the corresponding concepts, which
is a property particularly valuable for entities that
are ambiguous. In fact, it is precisely this observa-
tion that we rely on in order to generate sense tagged
corpora starting with the Wikipedia annotations.
For example, ambiguous words such as e.g. plant,
bar, or chair are linked to different Wikipedia ar-
ticles depending on their meaning in the context
where they occur. Note that the links are manually
created by the Wikipedia users, which means that
they are most of the time accurate and referencing

the correct article. The following represent five ex-
ample sentences for the ambiguous word bar, with
their corresponding Wikipedia annotations (links):
In 1834, Sumner was admitted to the [[bar
(law)|bar]] at the age of twenty-three, and entered
private practice in Boston.
It is danced in 3/4 time (like most waltzes), with
the couple turning approx. 180 degrees every [[bar
(music)|bar]].
Vehicles of this type may contain expensive au-
dio players, televisions, video players, and [[bar
(counter)|bar]]s, often with refrigerators.
Jenga is a popular beer in the [[bar
(establishment)|bar]]s of Thailand.
This is a disturbance on the water surface of a river
or estuary, often cause by the presence of a [[bar
(landform)|bar]] or dune on the riverbed.
To derive sense annotations for a given ambigu-
ous word, we use the links extracted for all the hy-
perlinked Wikipedia occurrences of the given word,
and map these annotations to word senses. For in-
stance, for the bar example above, we extract five
possible annotations: bar (counter), bar (establish-
ment), bar (landform), bar (law), and bar (music).
Although Wikipedia provides the so-called dis-
ambiguation pages that list the possible meanings of
a given word, we decided to use instead the anno-
tations collected directly from the Wikipedia links.
This decision is motivated by two main reasons.
First, a large number of the occurrences of ambigu-
ous words are not linked to the articles mentioned
by the disambiguation page, but to related concepts.
This can happen when the annotation is performed
using a concept that is similar, but not identical to the
concept defined. For instance, the annotation for the
word bar in the sentence “The blues uses a rhyth-
mic scheme of twelve 4/4 [[measure (music)|bars]]”
is measure (music), which, although correct and di-
rectly related to the meaning of bar (music), is not
listed in the disambiguation page for bar.
Second, most likely due to the fact that Wikipedia
is still in its incipient phase, there are several in-
consistencies that make it difficult to use the disam-
biguation pages in an automatic system. For exam-
ple, for the word bar, the Wikipedia page with the
identifier bar is a disambiguation page, whereas for
the word paper, the page with the identifier paper
contains a description of the meaning of paper as
“material made of cellulose,” and a different page
paper (disambiguation) is defined as a disambigua-
tion page. Moreover, in other cases such as e.g. the
entries for the word organization, no disambiguation
page is defined; instead, the articles corresponding
to different meanings of this word are connected by
links labeled as “alternative meanings.”
Therefore, rather than using the senses listed in
a disambiguation page as the sense inventory for
a given ambiguous word, we chose instead to col-
lect all the annotations available for that word in
the Wikipedia pages, and then map these labels to
a widely used sense inventory, namely WordNet.3

3.1 Building Sense Tagged Corpora
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998369">
Starting with a given ambiguous word, we derive a
sense-tagged corpus following three main steps:
First, we extract all the paragraphs in Wikipedia
that contain an occurrence of the ambiguous word
as part of a link or a piped link. We select para-
graphs based on the Wikipedia paragraph segmen-
tation, which typically lists one paragraph per line.4
To focus on the problem of word sense disambigua-
tion, rather than named entity recognition, we ex-
plicitly avoid named entities by considering only
those word occurrences that are spelled with a lower
case. Although this simple heuristic will also elim-
inate examples where the word occurs at the begin-
ning of a sentence (and therefore are spelled with an
upper case), we decided nonetheless to not consider
these examples so as to avoid any possible errors.
Next, we collect all the possible labels for the
given ambiguous word by extracting the leftmost
component of the links. For instance, in the
piped link [[musical notation|bar]], the label musi-
cal notation is extracted. In the case of simple links
(e.g. [[bar]]), the word itself can also play the role
of a valid label if the page it links to is not deter-
mined as a disambiguation page.
Finally, the labels are manually mapped to their
corresponding WordNet sense, and a sense tagged
3Alternatively, the Wikipedia annotations could also play
the role of a sense inventory, without the mapping to WordNet.
We chose however to perform this mapping for the purpose of
allowing evaluations using a widely used sense inventory.

corpus is created. This mapping process is very fast,
as a relatively small number of labels is typically
identified for a given word. For instance, for the
dataset used in the experiments reported in Section
5, an average of 20 labels per word was extracted.
To ensure the correctness of this last step, for
the experiments reported in this paper we used two
human annotators who independently mapped the
Wikipedia labels to their corresponding WordNet
sense. In case of disagreement, a consensus was
reached through adjudication by a third annotator.
In a mapping agreement experiment performed on
the dataset from Section 5, an inter-annotator agree-
ment of 91.1% was observed with a kappa statistics
of κ=87.1, indicating a high level of agreement.

3.2 An Example
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999955733333333">
As an example, consider the ambiguous word bar,
with 1,217 examples extracted from Wikipedia
where bar appeared as the rightmost component of
a piped link or as a word in a simple link. Since
the page with the identifier bar is a disambigua-
tion page, all the examples containing the single
link [[bar]] are removed, as the link does not re-
move the ambiguity. This process leaves us with
1,108 examples, from which 40 different labels are
extracted. These labels are then manually mapped
to nine senses in WordNet. Figure 1 shows the la-
bels extracted from the Wikipedia annotations for
the word bar, the corresponding WordNet definition,
as well as the Wikipedia definition (when the sense
was defined in the Wikipedia disambiguation page).

4 Word Sense Disambiguation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999957115384616">
Provided a set of sense-annotated examples for a
given ambiguous word, the task of a word sense dis-
ambiguation system is to automatically learn a dis-
ambiguation model that can predict the correct sense
for a new, previously unseen occurrence of the word.
We use a word sense disambiguation system that
integrates local and topical features within a ma-
chine learning framework, similar to several of the
top-performing supervised word sense disambigua-
tion systems participating in the recent SENSEVAL
evaluations (http://www.senseval.org).
The disambiguation algorithm starts with a pre-
processing step, where the text is tokenized and an-
notated with part-of-speech tags. Collocations are
identified using a sliding window approach, where
a collocation is defined as a sequence of words that
forms a compound concept defined in WordNet.
Next, local and topical features are extracted from
the context of the ambiguous word. Specifically, we
use the current word and its part-of-speech, a local
context of three words to the left and right of the am-
biguous word, the parts-of-speech of the surround-
ing words, the verb and noun before and after the
ambiguous words, and a global context implemented
through sense-specific keywords determined as a list
of at most five words occurring at least three times

in the contexts defining a certain word sense.
This feature set is similar to the one used by (Ng
and Lee, 1996), as well as by a number of state-of-
the-art word sense disambiguation systems partici-
pating in the SENSEVAL-2 and SENSEVAL-3 evalu-
ations. The features are integrated in a Naive Bayes
classifier, which was selected mainly for its perfor-
mance in previous work showing that it can lead to
a state-of-the-art disambiguation system given the
features we consider (Lee and Ng, 2002).

5 Experiments and Results
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998221875">
To evaluate the quality of the sense annotations gen-
erated using Wikipedia, we performed a word sense
disambiguation experiment on a subset of the am-
biguous words used during the SENSEVAL-2 and
SENSEVAL-3 evaluations. Since the Wikipedia an-
notations are focused on nouns (associated with the
entities typically defined by Wikipedia), the sense
annotations we generate and the word sense disam-
biguation experiments are also focused on nouns.
Starting with the 49 ambiguous nouns used during
the SENSEVAL-2 (29) and SENSEVAL-3 (20) evalu-
ations, we generated sense tagged corpora follow-
ing the process outlined in Section 3.1. We then re-
moved all those words that have only one Wikipedia
label (e.g. detention, which occurs 58 times, but
appears as a single link [[detention]] in all the oc-
currences), or which have several labels that are all
mapped to the same WordNet sense (e.g. church,
which has 2,198 occurrences with several differ-
ent labels such as Roman church, Christian church,
Catholic church, which are all mapped to the mean-
ing of church, Christian church as defined in Word-
Net). This resulted in a set of 30 words that have
their Wikipedia annotations mapped to at least two
senses according to the WordNet sense inventory.
Table 2 shows the disambiguation results using
the word sense disambiguation system described in
Section 4, using ten-fold cross-validation. For each
word, the table also shows the number of senses, the
total number of examples, and two baselines: a sim-

sense by default,5 and a more refined baseline that

a word. The baseline is therefore “informed,” as compared to a

Overall, the Wikipedia-based sense annotations
were found reliable, leading to accurate sense classi-

44% compared to the most frequent sense baseline,
and 30% compared to the Lesk-corpus baseline.
There were a few exceptions to this general trend.
For instance, for some of the words for which only

data set have highly skewed sense distributions, such
as e.g. bank, which has a total number of 1,074 ex-
amples out of which 1,044 examples pertain to the
meaning of financial institution, or the word mate-
rial with 213 out of 223 examples annotated with
the meaning of substance.
One aspect that is particularly relevant for any su-
pervised system is the learning rate with respect to
the amount of available data. To determine the learn-
ing curve, we measured the disambiguation accu-
racy under the assumption that only a fraction of the
data were available. We ran ten fold cross-validation
experiments using 10%, 20%, ..., 100% of the data,
and averaged the results over all the words in the
data set. The resulting learning curve is plotted in
Figure 1. Overall, the curve indicates a continuously
growing accuracy with increasingly larger amounts
of data. Although the learning pace slows down after
a certain number of examples (about 50% of the data
currently available), the general trend of the curve
seems to indicate that more data is likely to lead to
increased accuracy. Given that Wikipedia is growing
at a fast pace, the curve suggests that the accuracy of
the word sense classifiers built on this data is likely
to increase for future versions of Wikipedia.
Another aspect we were interested in was the cor-
relation in terms of sense coverage with respect to
other sense annotated data currently available. For
the set of 30 nouns in our data set, we collected
all the word senses that were defined in either the
Wikipedia-based sense-tagged corpus or in the SEN-
SEVAL corpus. We then determined the percentage
covered by each sense with respect to the entire data
set available for a given ambiguous word. For in-
stance, the noun chair appears in Wikipedia with
senses #1 (68.0%), #2 (31.9%), and #4(0.1%), and
in SENSEVAL with senses #1 (87.7%), #2 (6.3%),
and #3 (6.0%). The senses that do not appear are in-
dicated with a 0% coverage. The correlation is then
measured between the relative sense frequencies of
all the words in our dataset, as observed in the two
corpora. Using the Pearson (r) correlation factor, we
found an overall correlation of r = 0.51 between the
sense distributions in the Wikipedia corpus and the
SENSEVAL corpus, which indicates a medium cor-
relation. This correlation is much lower than the
one observed between the sense distributions in the
training data and in the test data in the SENSEVAL
corpus, which was measured at a high r = 0.95.
This suggests that the sense coverage in Wikipedia
follows a different distribution than in SENSEVAL,
mainly reflecting the difference between the gen-
res of the two corpora: an online collection of en-
cyclopedic pages as available from Wikipedia, ver-
sus the manually balanced British National Cor-
pus used in SENSEVAL. It also suggests that using
the Wikipedia-based sense tagged corpus to disam-
biguate words in the SENSEVAL data or viceversa
would require a change in the distribution of senses
as previously done in (Agirre and Martinez, 2004).

Overall the sense distinctions identified in
Wikipedia are fewer and typically coarser than those
found in WordNet. As shown in Table 3, for the
set of ambiguous words listed in Table 2, an aver-
age of 4.6 senses were used in the SENSEVAL an-
notations, as compared to about 3.3 senses per word
found in Wikipedia. This is partly due to a differ-
ent sense coverage and distribution in the Wikipedia
data set (e.g. the meaning of ambiance for the am-
biguous word atmosphere does not appear at all in
the Wikipedia corpus, although it has the highest fre-
quency in the SENSEVAL data), and partly due to the
coarser sense distinctions made in Wikipedia (e.g.
Wikipedia does not make the distinction between the
act of grasping and the actual hold for the noun grip,
and occurrences of both of these meanings are anno-
tated with the label grip (handle)).
There are also cases when Wikipedia makes dif-
ferent or finer sense distinctions than WordNet. For
instance, there are several Wikipedia annotations for
image as copy, but this meaning is not even defined
in WordNet. Similarly, Wikipedia makes the distinc-
tion between dance performance and theatre perfor-
mance, but both these meanings are listed under one
single entry in WordNet (performance as public pre-
sentation). However, since at this stage we are map-
ping the Wikipedia annotations to WordNet, these
differences in sense granularity are diminished.

In word sense disambiguation, the line of work most
closely related to ours consists of methods trying to
address the sense-tagged data bottleneck problem.
A first set of methods consists of algorithms that
generate sense annotated data using words semanti-
cally related to a given ambiguous word (Leacock et
al., 1998; Mihalcea and Moldovan, 1999; Agirre and
Martinez, 2004). Related non-ambiguous words,
such as monosemous words or phrases from dictio-
nary definitions, are used to automatically collect
examples from the Web. These examples are then
turned into sense-tagged data by replacing the non-
ambiguous words with their ambiguous equivalents.
Another approach proposed in the past is based on
the idea that an ambiguous word tends to have dif-
SENSEVAL-3 words, an average accuracy of 71.31% was mea-
sured (the output of the systems participating in SENSEVAL is
publicly available from http://www.senseval.org).
ferent translations in a second language (Resnik and
Yarowsky, 1999). Starting with a collection of paral-
lel texts, sense annotations were generated either for
one word at a time (Ng et al., 2003; Diab, 2004), or
for all words in unrestricted text (Diab and Resnik,
2002), and in both cases the systems trained on these
data were found to be competitive with other word
sense disambiguation systems.
The lack of sense-tagged corpora can also be cir-
cumvented using bootstrapping algorithms, which
start with a few annotated seeds and iteratively gen-
erate a large set of disambiguation patterns. This
method, initially proposed by (Yarowsky, 1995),
was successfully evaluated in the context of the
SENSEVAL framework (Mihalcea, 2002).
Finally, in an effort related to the Wikipedia col-
lection process, (Chklovski and Mihalcea, 2002)
have implemented the Open Mind Word Expert sys-
tem for collecting sense annotations from volunteer
contributors over the Web. The data generated using
this method was then used by the systems participat-
ing in several of the SENSEVAL-3 tasks.
Notably, the method we propose has several ad-
vantages over these previous methods. First, our
method relies exclusively on monolingual data, thus
avoiding the possible constraints imposed by meth-
ods that require parallel texts, which may be difficult
to find. Second, the Wikipedia-based annotations
follow a natural Zipfian sense distribution, unlike the
equal distributions typically obtained with the meth-
ods that rely on the use of monosemous relatives
or bootstrapping methods. Finally, the grow pace
of Wikipedia is much faster than other more task-
focused and possibly less-engaging activities such
as Open Mind Word Expert, and therefore has the
potential to lead to significantly higher coverage.
With respect to the use of Wikipedia as a re-
source for natural language processing tasks, the
work that is most closely related to ours is per-
haps the name entity disambiguation algorithm pro-
posed in (Bunescu and Pasca, 2006), where an SVM
kernel is trained on the entries found in Wikipedia
for ambiguous named entities. Other language pro-
cessing tasks with recently proposed solutions re-
lying on Wikipedia are co-reference resolution us-
ing Wikipedia-based measures of word similarity
(Strube and Ponzetto, 2006), enhanced text classi-
fication using encyclopedic knowledge (Gabrilovich

<bodyText confidence="0.999991628571429">
In this paper, we described an approach for us-
ing Wikipedia as a source of sense annotations for
word sense disambiguation. Starting with the hy-
perlinks available in Wikipedia, we showed how we
can generate a sense annotated corpus that can be
used to train accurate sense classifiers. Through ex-
periments performed on a subset of the SENSEVAL
words, we showed that the Wikipedia sense annota-
tions can be used to build a word sense disambigua-
tion system leading to a relative error rate reduction
of 30–44% as compared to simpler baselines.
Despite some limitations inherent to this approach
(definitions and annotations in Wikipedia are avail-
able almost exclusively for nouns, word and sense
distributions are sometime skewed, the annotation
labels are occasionally inconsistent), these limi-
tations are overcome by the clear advantage that
comes with the use of Wikipedia: large sense tagged
data for a large number of words at virtually no cost.
We believe that this approach is particularly
promising for two main reasons. First, the size of
Wikipedia is growing at a steady pace, which conse-
quently means that the size of the sense tagged cor-
pora that can be generated based on this resource
is also continuously growing. While techniques for
supervised word sense disambiguation have been re-
peatedly criticized in the past for their limited cover-
age, mainly due to the associated sense-tagged data
bottleneck, Wikipedia seems a promising resource
that could provide the much needed solution for this
problem. Second, Wikipedia editions are available
for many languages (currently about 200), which
means that this method can be used to generate sense
tagged corpora and build accurate word sense clas-
sifiers for a large number of languages.

This suggests that the sense coverage in Wikipedia follows a different distribution than in SENSEVAL, mainly reflecting the difference between the genres of the two corpora: an online collection of encyclopedic pages as available from Wikipedia, versus the manually balanced British National Corpus used in SENSEVAL.

There were a few exceptions to this general trend.

Despite their high performance, these supervised systems have an important drawback: their applicability is limited to those few words for which sense tagged data is available, and their accuracy is strongly connected to the amount of labeled data available at hand. To address the sense-tagged data bottleneck problem, different methods have been proposed in the past, with various degrees of success. This includes the automatic generation of sense-tagged data using monosemous relatives (Leacock et al., 1998; Mihalcea and Moldovan, 1999; Agirre and Martinez, 2004), automatically bootstrapped disambiguation patterns (Yarowsky, 1995; Mihalcea, 2002), parallel texts as a way to point out word senses bearing different translations in a second language (Diab and Resnik, 2002; Ng et al., 2003; Diab, 2004), and the use of volunteer contributions over the Web (Chklovski and Mihalcea, 2002).

A first set of methods consists of algorithms that generate sense annotated data using words semantically related to a given ambiguous word (Leacock et al., 1998; Mihalcea and Moldovan, 1999; Agirre and Martinez, 2004). Related non-ambiguous words, such as monosemous words or phrases from dictionary definitions, are used to automatically collect examples from the Web. These examples are then turned into sense-tagged data by replacing the nonambiguous words with their ambiguous equivalents.

With respect to the use of Wikipedia as a resource for natural language processing tasks, the work that is most closely related to ours is perhaps the name entity disambiguation algorithm proposed in (Bunescu and Pasca, 2006), where an SVM kernel is trained on the entries found in Wikipedia for ambiguous named entities. Other language processing tasks with recently proposed solutions relying on Wikipedia are co-reference resolution using Wikipedia-based measures of word similarity (Strube and Ponzetto, 2006), enhanced text classification using encyclopedic knowledge (Gabrilovich 202 and Markovitch, 2006), and the construction of comparable corpora using the multilingual editions of Wikipedia (Adafre and de Rijke, 2006). 8 Conclusions In this paper, we described an approach for using Wikipedia as a source of sense annotations for word sense disambiguation. Starting with the hyperlinks available in Wikipedia, we showed how we can generate a sense annotated corpus that can be used to train accurate sense classifiers. Through experiments performed on a subset of the SENSEVAL words, we showed that the</context>

For instance, the English noun plant can mean green plant or factory; similarly the French word feuille can mean leaf or paper. The correct sense of an ambiguous word can be selected based on the context where it occurs, and correspondingly the problem of word sense disambiguation is defined as the task of automatically assigning the most appropriate meaning to a polysemous word within a given context. Among the various knowledge-based (Lesk, 1986; Galley and McKeown, 2003; Navigli and Velardi, 2005) and data-driven (Yarowsky, 1995; Ng and Lee, 1996; Pedersen, 2001) word sense disambiguation methods that have been proposed to date, supervised systems have been constantly observed as leading to the highest performance. In these systems, the sense disambiguation problem is formulated as a supervised learning task, where each sense-tagged occurrence of a particular word is transformed into a feature vector which is then used in an automatic learning process. Despite their high performance, these supervised systems have an important drawback: their applicability is limited to those few words for which sense tagged data is a</context>

Starting with a collection of parallel texts, sense annotations were generated either for one word at a time (Ng et al., 2003; Diab, 2004), or for all words in unrestricted text (Diab and Resnik, 2002), and in both cases the systems trained on these data were found to be competitive with other word sense disambiguation systems. The lack of sense-tagged corpora can also be circumvented using bootstrapping algorithms, which start with a few annotated seeds and iteratively generate a large set of disambiguation patterns. This method, initially proposed by (Yarowsky, 1995), was successfully evaluated in the context of the SENSEVAL framework (Mihalcea, 2002). Finally, in an effort related to the Wikipedia collection process, (Chklovski and Mihalcea, 2002) have implemented the Open Mind Word Expert system for collecting sense annotations from volunteer contributors over the Web. The data generated using this method was then used by the systems participating in several of the SENSEVAL-3 tasks. Notably, the method we propose has several advantages over these previous methods. First, our method relies exclusively on monolingual data, thus avoiding the possible const</context>
