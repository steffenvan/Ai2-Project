The DARPA IXO mission is to develop “systems
for real-time sensing, exploitation, and decision making
in a rich tactical environment”. The mission includes
the development of individual technologies for sensors,
sensor exploitation and command/control as well as the
technology of information integration. Our research
focuses on how to integrate distributed services in a
dynamic networked environment to support IXO
applications. This dynamic networked environment
should include the following capabilities (DARPA,
2002):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.8799103">
• Information users should have scalable dynamically
changing subscription services to heterogeneous
information services;
• Information providers should have scalable
publishing services for their dynamically changing
information products;
• Scalable intelligent middleware to dynamically
broker, compose, and manage the intermediate
services necessary to connect information users to
the right information products at the right time.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.997247484848485">
While some of these capabilities can be realized
with existing technologies, several challenging
problems, particularly in the areas of scalability,
semantic interoperability and dynamic extensibility,
may need 5 or 10 years basic research efforts to
adequately address. The Information Integration
Research Prototype (I2RP) we describe is a vehicle for
exploring which new paradigms and frameworks are
most promising for future investment while calibrating
what existing technologies can do today (Jiang et al.,
2002). This demonstration illustrates the I2RP
architecture and the underlying technology approaches.
In six months, we implemented an extensible prototype
system with basic capability as a proof-of-concept to
show some fundamental new ideas for implementing
next generation dynamic information integration
systems.
IR2P is an information integration research
prototype built with commercial-off-shelf technologies.
With the prototype system, the declaration-composition-
production process of semantic integration has been
investigated, with specific emphasis on semantic
interoperability issues (Sirin et al., 2002). A target-
tracking scenario was developed to test the system and
all components in the I2RP were successfully integrated
“on the fly” to support this mission. Meanwhile we
proposed and analyzed some metrics to quantify the
semantic integration process such as semantic depth,
markup complexity and information fluidity. From
different aspects, we built some models to analyze the
relationship between semantic depth and markup
complexity, and between semantic interoperability and
information fluidity.

Queries

<bodyText confidence="0.9998925">
The work on IR2P has evolved into a more general
engine for tracking, fusing, and querying processes. We
are presently developing a generic process querying
capability that can be used to retrieve information about
objects as diverse as physical objects on a battlefield or
worms propagating through the Internet. Later we plan
to build a natural language querying capability as
proposed by Lulich and Thompson (2002).
