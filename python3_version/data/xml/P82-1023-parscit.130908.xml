As I was reflecting deeply in front of the
statue of Bodhisattva of Grammar and Wisdom in the
University Museum, I was startled to see Jane.
Having heard from Don that he had asked the old
cats to reflect on the 20 years of ACL, Jane had
decided that she should drop in on some of them
to seek their advice concerning the future of ACL.
&apos;,This work is supported by the unfunded grant FSN-
RND-HIN-82-57. I wish to thank Alice, the Cheshire
Puss, and Lewis Carroll for their help in the pre-
paration of this paper.
&amp;quot;What brings you here?&amp;quot; I asked with a grin.
Jane thought for a while and said:
&amp;quot;Would you tell me, please, which way I
ought to take ACL in the future?&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;That depends a good deal on where you think
it should go,&amp;quot; I replied.
&amp;quot;I don&apos;t such care where ,&amp;quot;, said Jane.
&amp;quot;Then it doesn&apos;t matter 7E10E:way you take
it,&amp;quot; I said after prolonged reflection.
so long as I take it somewhere,&amp;quot; Jane
added as an explanation.
&amp;quot;Oh, you are sure to do that,&amp;quot; said I, &amp;quot;if
you only parse long enough.&amp;quot;
Jane felt that this could not be denied, so
just to be friendly She decided to ask another
question:
&amp;quot;What sort of computational linguists live
about here?&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;Well, in that direction lives Bonnie,&amp;quot; I
said waving my right paw and waving the other paw,
&amp;quot;and in that direction lives Ra-rbara. Visit
either you like:they&apos;re both mad.&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;But I don&apos;t want to go among mad people,&amp;quot;
Jane remarked.
&amp;quot;Oh, you can&apos;t help that,&amp;quot; said I, &amp;quot;we&apos;re all
mad here. I&apos;m mad. You&apos;re mad.&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;How do you know I&apos;m mad?&amp;quot; said Jane.
&amp;quot;You must be,&amp;quot; said I, &amp;quot;or you wouldn&apos;t have
come here.&amp;quot;
Jane didn&apos;t think that proved it at all. How-
ever, she went on: &amp;quot;And how do you know that
you&apos;re mad?&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;Well, to begin with,&amp;quot; said I, &amp;quot;Don is not
mad. You grant that?&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;I suppose so,&amp;quot; said Jane.
Neal, then,&amp;quot; I went on, &amp;quot;Don is not mad and
I am not Don. Therefore, I am mad.&amp;quot;
Jane didn&apos;t appear to be satisfied with this
bit of catatonic logic (quite distinct from the
monotonic logic).
&amp;quot;I must go for a walk now and continue re-
flecting,&amp;quot; I said, as I left her, leaving my grin
behind.
