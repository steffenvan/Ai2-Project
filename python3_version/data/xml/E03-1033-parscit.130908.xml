In (Kanazawa, 1998) it was shown
that rigid Classical Categorial Gram-
mars are learnable (in the sense of
(Gold, 1967)) from strings. Surpris-
ingly there are recent negative results
for, among others, rigid associative
Lambek (L) grammars.
In this paper the non-learnability

LP (Associative-Commutative Lam-

<bodyText confidence="0.966265611111111">
The question of learnability of categorial gram-
mar (CG) was first taken up in (Kanazawa,
1998). Categorial grammar is an example of
a radically lexicalized formalism, the details of
which will be discussed in Section 2. Kanazawa
studied only subclasses of Classical Catego-
rial Grammar, results for subclasses of Lam-
bek grammars can be found in (Foret and Nir,
2002a), (Foret and Nir, 2002b).
The model of learnability used here is iden-
tification in the limit from positive data as in-
troduced in (Gold, 1967).1 In order to show
the non-learnability of rigid LP and LP0 we
&apos;Space restrictions do not allow a full exposition of
this model. The interested reader is referred to the first
two chapters of (Kanazawa, 1998).

in Section 3) for these classes.

Categorial grammar originated in (Aj-
dukiewicz, 1935) and was further developed in
(Bar-Hillel, 1953) and (Lambek, 1958). This
paper will only give a brief introduction in
this field, (Casadio, 1988) or (Moortgat, 1997)
offers a more comprehensive overview.
A categorial grammar is a set of assignments
of types to symbols from a fixed alphabet E,
the types are either primitives or are composed
from types with the binary connectives /, \,..
Rules specify how types are to be combined to
form new types. A string is said to be in the
language generated by grammar G (written as
s e L(G), L is known as a naming function)
if G assigns types to the symbols in the string
such that these types can be combined to de-
rive the distinguished type, normally written as
s or t.

In an application AI B,B H A or B,B\A H
A the type B is an argument and AI B and
B\A are known as functors.
In (Foret and Nir, 2002a) it was shown that
rigid grammars (grammars that assign only
one type to any particular symbol) in L are
not learnable from strings. They made use of
the fact that in L the axiom A/A, A/A —&gt; A/A
(and in Lo the axiom BI(A1A) B) holds.
These axioms cause contraction-like phenom-
ena that allow the existence of limit points
even in a class of rigid grammars. They de-
fined rigid grammars Gn, n C N and G such
that L(an) = c(b*a*)&amp;quot; and L(G) = e{a,b}*.
For G„ the number of alternations between a
sequence of a&apos;s and a sequence of b&apos;s, (both of
unbounded length) is bounded. This approach
is not readily applicable to either LP or LP0
grammars, since commutativity removes the
bound on the number of alterations in L(a).
Instead we exploit an assymmetry inherent in
the Lifting operation.
As noted in (Lambek, 1988), Lifting is a clo-
sure operation as it enjoys the following prop-
erties (we write AB for both B I(A\B) and

<bodyText confidence="0.9990911">
if A C, then AB CB.
Note that in general AB 74 A, which implies
that, during a derivation, once an atomic type
is lifted it cannot be lowered anymore.
The calculus LP was introduced in (van
Benthem, 1986) because of its natural relation
with a fragment of the lambda calculus, but
there is also linguistic motivation for introduc-
ing commutativity. Also see (van Benthem,
1987).
All permutation closures of context-free lan-
guages are recognizable in LP (van Benthem,
1991). Also note that the languages express-
ible in L and NL are precisely the context-
free languages (see (Pentus, 1993; Kandulski,
1988), respectively). These formalisms do not
have the necessary expressive power to capture
natural languages (which require at least mild
context-sensitivity). Therefore more expres-
sive variants have been proposed, for example

the multi-modal variant (MMCG) where appli-
cability of postulates is controlled through the
use of modal operators in the lexicon. This
variant, without restrictions on postulates, is
a Turing-complete system (Carpenter, 1999).
Recently some restrictions on postulates have
been proposed that restrict expressive power to
(mild) context-sensitivity, see (Moot, 2002).
The presentation of LP used here is due to
(Kurtonina and Moortgat, 1997), it takes NL
(Figure 1) as the &apos;base logic&apos;3 and adds asso-
ciativity and commutativity postulates (Figure
2). This facilitates some of the steps in our
(syntactic) proofs, and makes the derivations
more explicit.
3 The construction of a limit point
The following is taken from (Kapur, 1991):
Definition 2 Existence Of A Limit Point
A class G of languages is said to have a limit
point if and only if there exists an infinite se-
quence (L,),EN of languages in G such that
Lo c Li c C C
and there exists another language L in f such
3Note that, unless otherwise stated, the empty se-
quent is not allowed, i.e. I— A may not occur in any
derivation. Lambek variants which allow the empty
string have 0 added as subscript, for example NL with
empty sequent is written as NL0.

The language L is called a limit point of L.
Lemma 3 If L(g) has a limit point, then g is
not (non-effectively) learnable.
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.903037363636364">
In other words, when a class has a limit
point it is not learnable because the input to
the learner can never provide enough informa-
tion to justify convergence. Thus even allow-
ing a non-computable learning function makes
no difference in such a case, and establishing
the existence of a limit point provides a very
strong negative result.

Lemma 6 The language generated by G+ is
a, c+ )perm.
Proof:
1. We show that (s, a, c+)Peim C L(G+):
Grammar G+ assigns (sla)1(cle) to s,
and c/c to c. Since in LP the axiom
A/A, A/A —&gt; A/A holds, it follows imme-
diately that co... c H c/c, thus with right-
elimination we get s oc+ H s/a. Grammar
G+ assigns a to a, thus (s 0 c+)oa H s. By
associativity and commutativity any per-
mutation of this sequent will also derive
s, thus any string in (s, a, c+)P&amp;quot;m can be
derived.
2. We show that L(G+) C (s, a, c+)Pelm:
For a string a to be included in a lan-
guage generated by an LP grammar G,
G must assign a type T+ to a symbol in
a that has s as subtype. Grammar G+
assigns such a type only to the symbol
s. Furthermore, 8 occurs only once, as
range subtype, ill this type. Hence s
must occur (only) once in every sentence
in L(G+). Since T+ has only two domain
subtypes TD+ = a and TM F= c/c, every
sentence in L(G+) must contain at least
one symbol to which G+ assigns a type
with a as range subtype, the only symbol
that qualifies is a. Thus all derivations
for a string in this language must start

the class under consideration is bi-directional,

4 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999051066666667">
We have shown that the classes of rigid LP
and LP0 grammars have limit points and are
thus not learnable from strings. These results,
as well as the negative results from (Foret and
Nir, 2002a) and (Foret and Nir, 2002b) are
quite surprising in the light of certain gen-
eral results in learnability theory. To quote
(Kanazawa, 1998), page 159:
Placing a numerical bound on the
complexity of a grammar can lead to a
non-trivial learnable class. [.. .1 To-
gether with Shinohara&apos;s ((Shinohara,
1990a), (Shinohara, 1990b)) earlier
result [context-free grammars having
at most k rules are learnable], this
suggests that something like this may
in fact turn out to be typical in learn-
ability theory.
The negative results for Lambek-like systems
show that this is not the case. Even placing
bounds on the complexity of the types appear-
ing in the grammar may not help: rigid L is
not even learnable when the order of types is
bounded to 2.
The most important (subclass of) L-variant
for which the question of learnability is still
open is (rigid) NL. Results on the strong gene-
rative capacity of NL can be found in (Tiede,
1999), where it is suggested that they may help
in establishing learnability results.

A final thought concerns the claim in (Foret
and Nir, 2002a) and (Foret and Nir, 2002b)
that these results demonstrate the paucity of
&apos;fiat&apos; strings as input for a learner. They
suggest that enriched input (i.e. some kind
of bracketing or additional semantic informa-
tion) may overcome this problem, which is
certainly an interesting approach. However,
one could also take another approach to con-
structing learnable classes within some Lam-
bek(like) calculus by restricting the use of pos-
tulates. The multimodal approach (see for ex-
ample (Moortgat and Morrill, 1991)) offers a
way of doing this in the lexicon. The viability
of this approach is of course dependent on the
learnability of the class of rigid NL grammars.
Even given a positive result for this class it
may prove to be very hard to find characteri-
zations of learnable classes of grammars within
the multimodal paradigm.

Surprisingly there are recent negative results for, among others, rigid associative Lambek (L) grammars. In this paper the non-learnability of the class of rigid grammars in LP (Associative-Commutative Lambek calculus) and LP0 (same, but allowing the empty sequent in derivations) will be shown. 1 Introduction The question of learnability of categorial grammar (CG) was first taken up in (Kanazawa, 1998).

This corrolary gives an easy result for multiplicative intuitionistic linear logic (MILL), which is an alternative formulation of LPO: Corollary 14 The class of rigid MILL grammars is not (non-effectively) learnable from strings. 4 Conclusion We have shown that the classes of rigid LP and LP0 grammars have limit points and are thus not learnable from strings. These results, as well as the negative results from (Foret and Nir, 2002a) and (Foret and Nir, 2002b) are quite surprising in the light of certain general results in learnability theory. To quote (Kanazawa, 1998), page 159: Placing a numerical bound on the complexity of a grammar can lead to a non-trivial learnable class. [.. .1 Together with Shinohara&apos;s ((Shinohara, 1990a), (Shinohara, 1990b)) earlier result [context-free grammars having at most k rules are learnable], this suggests that something like this may in fact turn out to be typical in learnability theory. The negative results for Lambek-like systems show that this is not the case. Even placing bounds on the complexity of the types appearing in the grammar may not help: rigid L is not even learnable when the order of types is bounded to 2. T</context>

The calculus LP was introduced in (van Benthem, 1986) because of its natural relation with a fragment of the lambda calculus, but there is also linguistic motivation for introducing commutativity. Also see (van Benthem, 1987). All permutation closures of context-free languages are recognizable in LP (van Benthem, 1991). Also note that the languages expressible in L and NL are precisely the contextfree languages (see (Pentus, 1993; Kandulski, 1988), respectively).

These axioms cause contraction-like phenomena that allow the existence of limit points even in a class of rigid grammars. They defined rigid grammars Gn, n C N and G such that L(an) = c(b*a*)&amp;quot; and L(G) = e{a,b}*. For G„ the number of alternations between a sequence of a&apos;s and a sequence of b&apos;s, (both of unbounded length) is bounded. This approach is not readily applicable to either LP or LP0 grammars, since commutativity removes the bound on the number of alterations in L(a). Instead we exploit an assymmetry inherent in the Lifting operation. As noted in (Lambek, 1988), Lifting is a closure operation as it enjoys the following properties (we write AB for both B I(A\B) and (B A)\B): A —&gt; AB , (AB)B AB, if A C, then AB CB. Note that in general AB 74 A, which implies that, during a derivation, once an atomic type is lifted it cannot be lowered anymore. The calculus LP was introduced in (van Benthem, 1986) because of its natural relation with a fragment of the lambda calculus, but there is also linguistic motivation for introducing commutativity.

They suggest that enriched input (i.e. some kind of bracketing or additional semantic information) may overcome this problem, which is certainly an interesting approach. However, one could also take another approach to constructing learnable classes within some Lambek(like) calculus by restricting the use of postulates. The multimodal approach (see for example (Moortgat and Morrill, 1991)) offers a way of doing this in the lexicon. The viability of this approach is of course dependent on the learnability of the class of rigid NL grammars. Even given a positive result for this class it may prove to be very hard to find characterizations of learnable classes of grammars within the multimodal paradigm. 5 Appendix: Derivations The following list of derivations was obtained using Grail7, included to give a feel for the kind of derivations our construction allows.
