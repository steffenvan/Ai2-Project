The goal of the PANGLOSS projectl is to develop a sys-
tem which will, from the very beginning, produce high-
quality translations of unconstrained text. This can only
be attained currently by keeping the human in the trans-
lation loop, in our case via a software module called the
AUGMENTOR. The main measure of progress in the de-
velopment of the Pangloss system will therefore be the
gradual decrease in need for user assistance, as the level
of automation increases.
The analyzer used in the first version of PANGLOSS, PAN-
GLOSS MARK I, is a version of the ULTRA Spanish analyzer
from NMSU [Farwell 19901, while generation is carried
out by the PENMAN generator from ISI [Mann 1983]. The
Translator&apos;s Workstation (Tws) provides the user inter-
face and the integration platform [Nirenburg 1992]. This
paper focuses on this use of TVs as a substrate for PAN-
GLOSS.
PANGLOSS operates in the following mode: a) a fully-
automated translation of each full sentence is attempted;
if it fails, then b) a fully-automated translation of smaller
chunks of text is attempted (in the first PANGLOSS con-
figuration, PANGLOSS MARK I, these were noun phrases);
c) the material that does not get covered by noun phrases
is treated in &amp;quot;word-for-word&amp;quot; mode, whereby translation
suggestions for each word (or phrase) are sought in the
system&apos;s MT lexicons, a machine-readable dictionary, and
a set of user glossaries; d) The resulting list of trans-
lated noun phrases and translation suggestions for words
and phrases is displayed in a special editor window of
TWS, where the human user finalizes the translation. At
stages a) and b) there is an option of the user being pre-
sented by the system with disambiguation questions via
the AUGMEN1DR. We provide an intelligent environment,
the CMAT (Constituent Machine-Aided Translation) edi-
tor, for postediting. It allows the user to select, move,
and delete words and phrases (constituents) quickly and
easily, using dynamically-changing menus.
As can be seen in Figure 1, each constituent in the target
window is surrounded by &amp;quot;&lt;&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;&gt;&gt;&amp;quot; characters. If the
user clicks with the mouse anywhere within a constituent
(between the &amp;quot;&lt;&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;&gt;&gt;&amp;quot; symbols), a CMAT menu for
that constituent appears. It contains the word or phrase
in the source text if available, the functions Move and
Delete, and alternative translations of the word or phrase
from the source text if any. Using these popup menus, the
user moves, replaces, or deletes a constituent with a single
mouse action, rapidly turning the list of translated words

and phrases into a coherent, high-quality target language
text. The user is not forced to use the CMAT editor at any
particular time. Its use can be intermingled with other
translation activities, according to the user&apos;s preferences.
While the above environment is useful as a substrate
for a gradual shift to ever more automatic systems, it is
also useful as a practical translator&apos;s tool. Many minor
improvements of the tool itself are planned that should
together result in a significant increase in the human trans-
lator&apos;s comfort and efficiency.
