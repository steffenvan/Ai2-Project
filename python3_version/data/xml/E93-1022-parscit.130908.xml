An algorithm for automatic
identification of topic and focus of
the sentence is presented, based on
dependency syntax and using
written input, which is much more
ambiguous than spoken utterance.
1. The dichotomy of topic and focus, based,
in the Praguean Functional Generative
Description, on the scale of communicative
dynamism (underlying word order), is relevant
not only for a possible placement of the
sentence in a context, but also for its semantic
interpretation.
The underlying word order differs from
the surface one especially in that the verb
stands more to the right than all its
complementations belonging to the topic of the
sentence (or to the local topic of the clause
headed by the verb), and more to the left than
those belonging to the focus. Using a
dependency grammar (or, more or less
equivalently, a flat structure in a constituency
based grammar), we can illustrate this by the
following example, where (1&apos;) is a simplified
underlying representation of (1) on a reading
answering e.g. the question Where has Charles
found my pen?:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.65176875">
(1) Charles has found your pen in a box lying
on the table.
(1&apos;) (Charles)Act ((you)Appuit Pen)ob; find. Perf
(box.Indef ORepAct lie (table) L..... )Ge.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998449857142857">
In (1&apos;) every pair of parentheses encompasses
a dependent item (i.e. corresponds to an edge
of the linearized dependency tree), the indices
of parentheses denote kinds of dependency
(valency slots, or theta roles and adjuncts):
Act stands for Actor (underlying Subject),
Appurt for Appurtenance (Possessivity in a
broader sense), Obj for Objective (underlying
Object), Loc for Locative, Gener for the
General Relationship (of an adjunct to its
head); the other indices denote values of
morphological categories (Perfect,
Indefiniteness) and of adverbial prepositions
(in, on), Rel denotes a relative pronoun (here

deleted on the surface). For more details of
the descriptive framework used, see Sgall et
al. (1986, Chapters 2 and 3).
An automatic identification of topic and
focus may use the input information on surface
word order, on the dependency relations
between autosemantic lexical occurrences, on
the systemic ordering of kinds of
complementations (reflected by the underlying
order of the items included in the focus), on
definiteness, on lexical semantic properties of
words and (if spoken input is used) on the
position of the intonation center (sentence
stress). The primary position of the intonation
center is at the end of the sentence (where it
need not be phonetically realized by a specific
stress), but also in another (secondary)
position the intonation center marks the most
dynamic part of the sentence (focus proper),
cf. (2), where the underlying order is as
indicated by (2&apos;):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.978986">
(2) Charles has found your PEN in a box lying
on the table.
(2&apos;) (Charles) (box ((Rel) (table) lie)) find
((you) pen)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.983100630769231">
After several years of research in this
domain, which has included psycholinguistic
experiments with Czech and German
sentences, as well as investigations with native
speakers of English, we are convinced that in
the individual languages there exists a basic
ordering of the kinds of complementations of
every verb (noun, adjective). We assume that
this ordering, called systemic ordering,
directly determines the underlying word order
in the focus, so that if a sentence part A
follows another one, B, under systemic
ordering, then B is less dynamic than A (i.e.
B precedes A in the underlying word order)
only if B belongs to the topic. In the topic part
of the sentence the underlying word order
often differs from systemic ordering. The
systemic ordering of some of the main kinds
of complementations in English has the
following shape: Time - Actor - Addressee -
Objective - Origin - Effect - Manner -
Directional(from) - Means - Directional(to) -
Locative
2. An automatic identification of topic,
focus and the degrees of communicative
dynamism, discussed in a preliminary way by
Haji6ova and Sgall (1985), can be based on
the following considerations: In languages with
a high degree of &amp;quot;free&amp;quot; word order (as in most
Slavonic languages), a secondary position of
the intonation center is frequent only in spoken
dialogues. In technical texts (spoken or
written) there is a strong tendency to arrange
the words so that the intonation center falls on
the last word of the sentence (where it need
not be phonetically manifested), of course with
the exception of enclitic words.
A general procedure for determining the
topic-focus articulation in such languages can
then be formulated as follows:
(i) All complementations (participants and
adverbials, or arguments and adjuncts)
preceding the verb are contextually bound. As
for the complementations following the verb,
a &amp;quot;main rule&amp;quot; may be stated: the boundary
between topic (to the left) and focus (to the
right) can be drawn between any two
elements, provided that those belonging to the
focus are arranged in the surface word order
in accordance with systemic ordering of the
kinds of complementations.
(ii) The verb is ambiguous as for its
position in the topic or in the focus.
(iii) If a spoken utterance (with its
intonation center identified) is analyzed, then
similar regularities hold for sentences with
normal intonation (intonation center at the
end). However, if a non-final element carries
the intonation center, then all the
complementations standing after this element
are contextually bound; for the rest of the
sentence, (i) and (ii) hold; the bearer of the
intonation center belongs to the focus.
In English the surface word order is
determined by grammatical rules to a large
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.99478">
179
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.974499423913043">
extent, so that intonation plays a more decisive
role than in the Slavonic languages. The
written shape of the sentence does not suffice
here to determine the topic-focus articulation
to such a degree as e.g. in Czech. The &amp;quot;main
rule&amp;quot; also applies, but otherwise only certain
important regularities can be stated here on the
basis of word order and grammatical values
(especially the articles and other determiners).
In order to be able to reduce the ambiguity
of the written shape of the English sentence as
much as possible, it is also necessary to take
into account certain semantic clues: especially
with Locative and the Temporal modifications,
it is important to distinguish between specific
information (e.g. on a nice September day, on
October 22, 1991, seven months ago) and
items containing just a general setting (e.g.
always) or being directly (as indexicals)
determined from the utterance (here, today,
this year). The latter examples usually belong
to the topic, the former ones typically
occurring in the focus. As for the verb, it is
important to have access to the verb of the
preceding utterance: if the main verb of
sentence n has the same meaning as (or a
meaning included in) that of sentence n-1, then
it belongs to the topic; also verbs with very
general lexical meanings (such as be, have,
happen, carry out, become) may be handled as
belonging to the topic. Otherwise (i.e. in the
unmarked case), the verb generally belongs to
the focus.
3. In the output of the algorithmic
procedure completing the parsing of a written
English sentence, many ambiguities remain,
but it is known that sentences (even in their
spoken shape) often are ambiguous as for their
topic-focus articulation, so that it should be
understood as a good result if the procedure
identifies such an ambiguity. The algorithm
has been formulated as follows:
(a) The input to our part of the parser is
assumed to have passed through the preceding
parts, by which the dependency structure of
the sentence has been identified, so that also
the underlying dependency relations (valency
positions) of the complementations (to the
governing verb) are known.
(b) If the verb occupies the rightmost
position in the sentence and its subject is
(ba) definite (including noun groups with
this, one of the, etc.), then the verb belongs to
the focus getting the index f, and its subject
belongs to the topic, which we denote by the
index t;
(bb) indefinite, then the subject is
(indexed by) f and the verb is t. In either case,
the other complementations are handled
according to (cb) below.
(c) If the verb does not occupy the
rightmost position, then:
(ca) the verb itself is understood as t, if
it has a very general lexical meaning (see
above), or as f if its meaning is very specific,
or else the verb is characterized as
intermediate, i.e. ambiguous, abbreviated as
WO;
(cb) the complementations preceding the
verb are denoted as t, with the exception of an
indefinite subject and of a specific (i.e. neither
general nor highly indexical, see above)
Temporal complementation; either of the latter
two is characterized as t/f;
(cc) to the right of the verb,
(i) if there is a single
complementation, and this is a personal
pronoun or another definite noun group, then
it is t or t/f, respectively;
(ii) if the rightmost complementation
is Temp or Loc, then if it is specific, it is f
and otherwise it is t; if it is another kind of
complementation, then if it is indefinite, it is
f and if definite, it is t/f;
(iii) if there is such an ordered pair
A,B to the right of the verb that fails to follow
systemic ordering (see Section 2 and the &amp;quot;main
rule&amp;quot; above), and B has not been assigned the
index t according to (ii), then, for the
rightmost such pair, A belongs to the topic (t),
and so do all the complementations between A
and the verb; the rightmost complementation
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.993192">
180
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.934222888888889">
of the whole sentence is f (only a personal
pronoun following another one is t/f in this
position), all those standing between A and the
rightmost one are t/f;
(iv) if (iii) does not apply then all
remaining complementations to the right of the
verb are t/f.
(d) If all the complementations have been
determined as t, then
(da) if the verb was t/f after point (ca)
and the rightmost complementation is a
definite noun group, an indexical word or
pronoun, then this rightmost element gets f
(this result is abbreviated as t(f));
(db) if (da) does not apply, then both the
rightmost element of the sentence and its verb
get t/f.
(e) The remaining representations
containing no f are discarded.
(f) The complementations with the index t
are shifted to the left of the verb, those with f,
to the right of it.
Let us add that our algorithm only
determines the appurtenance of an element to
the topic or to the focus, but does not specify
the underlying word order within topic. When
implemented (together with a simplified
parser), the algorithm was checked with a set
of sentences, and it yielded the expected
results, cf. the following examples (the
notation of which is simplified in that the
indices characterizing the underlying structure
(cf. (1&apos;) above) are left out). NOTE: Our
examples concern written English sentences. In
its present form, the algorithm handles only
the verb and the parts of sentence immediately
depending on it; deeper embedded items (esp.
adjuncts of nouns) are left aside for the time
being.

(A) Charles found the pen in a box.

In the topic part of the sentence the underlying word order often differs from systemic ordering. The systemic ordering of some of the main kinds of complementations in English has the following shape: Time - Actor - Addressee - Objective - Origin - Effect - Manner - Directional(from) - Means - Directional(to) - Locative 2. An automatic identification of topic, focus and the degrees of communicative dynamism, discussed in a preliminary way by Haji6ova and Sgall (1985), can be based on the following considerations: In languages with a high degree of &amp;quot;free&amp;quot; word order (as in most Slavonic languages), a secondary position of the intonation center is frequent only in spoken dialogues. In technical texts (spoken or written) there is a strong tendency to arrange the words so that the intonation center falls on the last word of the sentence (where it need not be phonetically manifested), of course with the exception of enclitic words. A general procedure for determining the topic-focus articulation in such languages can then be formulated as follows: (i) All comp</context>
