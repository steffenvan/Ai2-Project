The use of examples as the basis for machine translation systems has gained consider-
able acceptance since the original proposal of Nagao in 1984. In this short book, Jones
first reviews the fundamental principles of example-based machine translation (EBMT)
in order to then introduce the specific mechanisms of his model. The key characteristic
of this model is its purely stochastic processing, which is based on the algorithm put
forth by Skousen (1989) in his Analogical Modeling strategy for language comprehen-
sion.
Overall, the book is well-written and offers a good introduction to some of the
very interesting problems of machine translation. But my reading left me somewhat
unsatisfied. In order to explain this, let me first summarize the chapters.
The goals and method of the work are clearly stated in the nine pages that form the
introduction: Jones intends to demonstrate the possibility of uniformly using examples
rather than rules for machine translation. I emphasize that, in this context, &amp;quot;the term
&apos;analogy&apos; refers to the general process of deriving information about some new piece of
language by comparison with known piece(s) of language&amp;quot; (p. 4). Also, it is important
to understand that &amp;quot;the rejection of rule-based natural language processing does not
mean that linguistic representations cannot be used&amp;quot; (p. 5). Indeed, Jones subscribes
to a non-inferential heavily-predicated representational strategy based on Functional
Grammar. Within this framework, &amp;quot;source language predications and their target lan-
guage equivalents are stored as instantiated examples of translation, the source half of
which attempt to clone themselves onto the source language input.... The translations
are achieved by generating the target language half of the best matching example into
a surface realization.... Where only partial cloning is being achieved across a set of
examples, the process of recombination can be used to recombine elements of example
predications based on the results of the analogical modelling&amp;quot; (p. 6).
The second chapter provides some additional background material on EBMT, as
well as a partial survey of relevant research. Depth is typically privileged over breadth.
For example, Functional Grammar seems to reduce exclusively to the work of Dik
(1978) and van der Korst (1989), with the consequence that some details are mentioned
but not explained, or discussed at length and then never revisited in the rest of the
book.
Chapter 3 then overviews the proposed model, and more specifically, the rep-
resentations it uses. Very quickly the reader discovers complex hand-coded frames
littered with the primitives of Functional Grammar, as well as somewhat artificial ex-
amples from a narrow domain. Thus, the usual criticism against complex innate (nay,
ad hoc) data structures soon comes to mind. Jones does motivate the use of Functional
Grammar for machine translation and raises lots of interesting questions for MT. But

he fails to address convincingly the problem of having to specify these frames and
of having to associate them to their translations. Furthermore, generation is taken to
be a relatively straightforward process once the appropriate translation has been pro-
cessed, and thus is not discussed in the book. Finally, the importance of contextual
representation, and in particular of rhetorical information, is stressed throughout the
chapter. But Jones forewarns us in the introduction that rhetorical information is not
yet part of the implementation. Indeed, the rest of the book does not make clear how
much of the contextual processing has been implemented and tested, though, as he
insists, it is crucial to measure distance between input and pre-coded examples.
Instead, in the fourth chapter, Jones details the probabilistic mechanism that under-
lies the cloning process. More specifically, Jones explains how the processing scheme of
Analogical Modeling can be reused to stochastically assign case information to inputs
(in order to subsequently match them against prepared examples). A very interesting
comparison with the PDP work of McClelland and Kawamoto (1986) on this topic
follows (and continues in section 5.2). But the author fails to elaborate on the choice
of variables (and associated values) for his model.
Finally, chapter 5 presents the experiments carried out by Jones. These experiments
do not address machine translation per se, but rather focus on specific problems such
as determining sentential constituent structure by employing a simple frame-driven
heuristic algorithm. The reader must soon conclude that the proposed approach is
computationally very expensive and most likely does not scale up. The ad hoc—ness
of some of the facets of the model also inevitably emerges from the long descriptions
of these experiments. For example, for predicting lexical category, a span of only three
words is used.
In the end, the very short conclusions of chapter 6 only confirmed some of my
hesitations vis-à-vis the work. Beyond scalability, innateness, and ad hoc—ness issues,
beyond the disadvantages of predication, the book did not convince me that the pro-
posed model was interesting from a practical viewpoint. This is due in part to the
following concerns:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9501343">
1. a rather narrow bibliography that leaves out too much of the existing
research on Functional Grammar and on lexical statistics. (Consequently,
I doubt that the work has any appeal as a textbook even for an advanced
graduate course.)
2. the disclaimer about suprasentential contextual descriptions not being
part of the current implementation.
3. a lack of detailed comparisons with other (example-based and
non-example-based) strategies for MT.
4. the absence of a comprehensive example that addresses the multitude of
problems raised by Jones for MT.
