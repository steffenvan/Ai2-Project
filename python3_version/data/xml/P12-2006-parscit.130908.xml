Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.9924435">
In this work we present two extensions to
the well-known dynamic programming beam
search in phrase-based statistical machine
translation (SMT), aiming at increased effi-
ciency of decoding by minimizing the number
of language model computations and hypothe-
sis expansions. Our results show that language
model based pre-sorting yields a small im-
provement in translation quality and a speedup
by a factor of 2. Two look-ahead methods are
shown to further increase translation speed by
a factor of 2 without changing the search space
and a factor of 4 with the side-effect of some
additional search errors. We compare our ap-
proach with Moses and observe the same per-
formance, but a substantially better trade-off
between translation quality and speed. At a
speed of roughly 70 words per second, Moses
reaches 17.2% BLEU, whereas our approach
yields 20.0% with identical models.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999940121212121">
Research efforts to increase search efficiency for
phrase-based MT (Koehn et al., 2003) have ex-
plored several directions, ranging from generalizing
the stack decoding algorithm (Ortiz et al., 2006) to
additional early pruning techniques (Delaney et al.,
2006), (Moore and Quirk, 2007) and more efficient
language model (LM) querying (Heafield, 2011).
This work extends the approach by (Zens and
Ney, 2008) with two techniques to increase trans-
lation speed and scalability. We show that taking
a heuristic LM score estimate for pre-sorting the
phrase translation candidates has a positive effect on
both translation quality and speed. Further, we intro-
duce two novel LM look-ahead methods. The idea
of LM look-ahead is to incorporate the LM proba-
bilities into the pruning process of the beam search
as early as possible. In speech recognition it has
been used for many years (Steinbiss et al., 1994;
Ortmanns et al., 1998). First-word LM look-ahead
exploits the search structure to use the LM costs of
the first word of a new phrase as a lower bound for
the full LM costs of the phrase. Phrase-only LM
look-ahead makes use of a pre-computed estimate
of the full LM costs for each phrase. We detail the
implementation of these methods and analyze their
effect with respect to the number of LM computa-
tions and hypothesis expansions as well as on trans-
lation speed and quality. We also run comparisons
with the Moses decoder (Koehn et al., 2007), which
yields the same performance in BLEU, but is outper-
formed significantly in terms of scalability for faster
translation. Our implementation is available under
a non-commercial open source licence†.

We apply the decoding algorithm described in (Zens

2.1 Phrase candidate pre-sorting
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999997555555556">
In addition to the source sentence f1J, the beam
search algorithm takes a matrix E(·,·) as input,
where for each contiguous phrase f˜ = fj ... fj0
within the source sentence, E(j, j0) contains a list of
all candidate translations for f˜. The candidate lists
are sorted according to their model score, which was
observed to speed up translation by Delaney et al.
(2006). In addition to sorting according to the purely
phrase-internal scores, which is common practice,
we compute an estimate qLME(˜e) for the LM score
of each target phrase ˜e. qLME(˜e) is the weighted
LM score we receive by assuming e˜ to be a com-
plete sentence without using sentence start and end
markers. We limit the number of translation options
per source phrase to the No top scoring candidates
(observation histogram pruning).
The pre-sorting during phrase matching has two
effects on the search algorithm. Firstly, it defines
the order in which the hypothesis expansions take
place. As higher scoring phrases are considered first,
it is less likely that already created partial hypothe-
ses will have to be replaced, thus effectively reduc-
ing the expected number of hypothesis expansions.
Secondly, due to the observation pruning the sorting
affects the considered phrase candidates and conse-
quently the search space. A better pre-selection can
be expected to improve translation quality.

2.2 Language Model Look-Ahead
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999345735849057">
LM score computations are among the most expen-
sive in decoding. Delaney et al. (2006) report signif-
icant improvements in runtime by removing unnec-
essary LM lookups via early pruning. Here we de-
scribe an LM look-ahead technique, which is aimed
at further reducing the number of LM computations.
The innermost loop of the search algorithm iter-
ates over all translation options for a single source
phrase to consider them for expanding the current
hypothesis. We introduce an LM look-ahead score
qLMLA(˜e|˜e0), which is computed for each of the
translation options. This score is added to the over-
all hypothesis score, and if the pruning threshold is
§number of lexical hypotheses per coverage vector
exceeded, we discard the expansion without com-
puting the full LM score.
First-word LM look-ahead pruning defines the
LM look-ahead score qLMLA(˜e|˜e0) = qLM(˜e1|˜e0) to
be the LM score of the first word of target phrase e˜
given history ˜e0. As qLM(˜e1|˜e0) is an upper bound for
the full LM score, the technique does not introduce
additional seach errors. The score can be reused, if
the LM score of the full phrase e˜ needs to be com-
puted afterwards.
We can exploit the structure of the search to speed
up the LM lookups for the first word. The LM prob-
abilities are stored in a trie, where each node cor-
responds to a specific LM history. Usually, each
LM lookup consists of first traversing the trie to find
the node corresponding to the current LM history
and then retrieving the probability for the next word.
If the n-gram is not present, we have to repeat this
procedure with the next lower-order history, until a
probability is found. However, the LM history for
the first words of all phrases within the innermost
loop of the search algorithm is identical. Just be-
fore the loop we can therefore traverse the trie once
for the current history and each of its lower order n-
grams and store the pointers to the resulting nodes.
To retrieve the LM look-ahead scores, we can then
directly access the nodes without the need to traverse
the trie again. This implementational detail was con-
firmed to increase translation speed by roughly 20%
in a short experiment.
Phrase-only LM look-ahead pruning defines the
look-ahead score qLMLA(˜e|˜e0) = qLME(˜e) to be the
LM score of phrase ˜e, assuming e˜ to be the full sen-
tence. It was already used for sorting the phrases,
is therefore pre-computed and does not require ad-
ditional LM lookups. As it is not a lower bound for
the real LM score, this pruning technique can intro-
duce additional search errors. Our results show that
it radically reduces the number of LM lookups.

To observe the effect of the proposed search al-

pruning parameters, keeping track of the number of
hypothesis expansions and LM computations. The
LM score pre-sorting affects both the set of phrase
candidates due to observation histogram pruning and
the order in which they are considered. To sepa-
rate these effects, experiments were run both with
histogram pruning (No = 100) and without. From
Table 1 we can see that in terms of efficiency both
cases show similar improvements over the baseline,

lation model scores only. The number of hypothesis
expansions is reduced by ∼20% and the number of
LM lookups by ∼50%. When observation pruning
is applied, we additionally observe a small increase
by 0.2% in BLEU.
Application of first-word LM look-ahead further
reduces the number of LM lookups by 23%, result-
ing in doubled translation speed, part of which de-
rives from fewer trie node searches. The heuristic
phrase-only LM look-ahead method introduces ad-
ditional search errors, resulting in a BLEU drop by
0.3%, but yields another 85% reduction in LM com-
putations and increases throughput by a factor of 2.2.

tion performance in BLEU is plotted against speed
in Figure 1. Without the proposed extensions, Moses
slightly outperforms our decoder in terms of BLEU.
However, the latter already scales better for higher
speed. With LM score pre-sorting, the best BLEU
value is similar to Moses while further accelerat-
ing translation, yielding identical performance at 16
words/sec as Moses at 1.8 words/sec. Application
of first-word LM look-ahead shifts the graph to the
right, now reaching the same performance at 31
words/sec. At a fixed translation speed of roughly
70 words/sec, our approach yields 20.0% BLEU,
whereas Moses reaches 17.2%. For phrase-only LM
look-ahead the graph is somewhat flatter. It yields
nearly the same top performance with an even better
trade-off between translation quality and speed.
The final set of experiments is performed on both
the WMT and the IWSLT task. We directly com-
pare our decoder with the two LM look-ahead meth-
ods with Moses in four scenarios: the best possi-
ble translation, the fastest possible translation with-
out performance constraint and the fastest possible
translation with no more than 1% and 2% loss in
BLEU on the dev set compared to the best value.
Table 2 shows that on the WMT data, the top per-
formance is similar for both decoders. However, if
we allow for a small degradation in translation per-
formance, our approaches clearly outperform Moses
in terms of translation speed. With phrase-only LM
look-ahead, our decoder is faster by a factor of 6
for no more than 1% BLEU loss, a factor of 11 for
2% BLEU loss and a factor of 22 in the fastest set-
ting. The results on the IWSLT data are very similar.
Here, the speed difference reaches a factor of 19 in
the fastest setting.
