This paper is the result of an attempt to understand &apos;flavors&apos;, the object-
oriented programming system in Lispmachine Lisp. The authors argue
that the basic principles of such systems are not easily accessible to the
programming public, because papers on the subject rarely discuss concrete
details. Accordingly, the authors&apos; approach is pedagogical, and takes the
form of a description of the evolution of their own flavor system. An
appendix contains programming examples that are sufficiently detailed to
enable an average Lisp programmer to build a flavor system, and exper-
iment with the essential concepts of object-oriented programming.
This paper describes a parser for French based on an adaptation of
Chomsky&apos;s Government and Binding theory. Reflecting the modular
conception of GB-grammars, the parser consists of several modules corre-
sponding to some of the subtheories of the grammar, such as X bar, bind-
ing, etc. Making an extensive use of lexical information and following
strategies that attempt to take advantage of the basic properties of natural
languages, this parser is powerful enough to produce all of the grammatical
structures of sentences for a fairly substantial subset of French. At the
same time, it is restricted enough to avoid a proliferation of alternative
analyses, even with highly complex constructions. Particular attention has
been paid to the problem of the grammatical interpretation of wh-phrases,
to clitic constructions, as well as to the organisation and management of
the lexicon.

This paper outlines the system design of TOPIC and TOPOGRAPHIC, text
analysis and condensation projects within the general framework of infor-
mation science. Special information processing requirements (domain-
specific full-texts, varying user expectations) demand knowledge-based
parsing (frame model), supported by devices which are appropriate for
full-text analysis (word expert model) and by suitable condensation tech-
niques (computing of text constituents). The concept of cascaded conden-
sates (gradation of information from generic, classification-like concepts
over fragments of knowledge nets down to the original full-texts) guides
the realization of the output, which is supported by graphical means. Some
examples for graphically supported navigation and editing in the know-
ledge network are given. It is assumed that presentation on the display
must find an appropriate balance between over- and under-information.
The knowledge nets will be presented gradually via moving pictures. The
performance of TOPIC/TOPOGRAPHIC is at the moment comparable to
the information value of indicative abstracts. The texts to be analyzed and
condensed deal with information technologies from the point of view of
possible application in an office environment (management decisions about
the acquisition of information and communication technologies). The
system will be realized on an ONYX-microcomputer (under UNIX,1
programming in C) and on a workstation LILITH (programs in Modula-2).

In this paper prototype versions of a collection of word experts for text
analysis are dealt with in order to demonstrate that word experts are a
feasible tool for parsing texts on the level of text cohesion as well as text
coherence. The analysis is based on two major knowledge sources:
context information is modelled in terms of a frame knowledge base,
while the co-text keeps record of the linear sequence of text analysis. The
result of text parsing consists of a text graph which represents the thematic
organization of topics in a text.
