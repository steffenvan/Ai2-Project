One of the most robust findings of experimental psycholinguistics is that the context in which
a word is presented influences the effort involved in processing that word. We present a com-
putational model of contextual facilitation based on word co-occurrence vectors, and empiri-
cally validate the model through simulation of three representative types of context
manipulation: single word priming, multiple-priming and contextual constraint. The aim of our
study is to find out whether special-purpose mechanisms are necessary in order to capture the
pattern of the experimental results.

<bodyText confidence="0.999931543859649">
In psycholinguistics, lexical access is the proc-
ess of retrieving a word from the mental lexi-
con using perceptual and contextual
information. In everyday life, the point of this
process is to facilitate communication. Many
different experimental methodologies have
been brought to bear on the study of this proc-
ess, including visual and auditory lexical deci-
sion tasks (e.g., Meyer &amp; Schvaneveldt, 1971;
Moss, Ostrin, Tyler &amp; Marslen-Wilson, 1995),
event-related brain potentials (e.g., Brown,
Hagoort &amp; Chwilla, 2000), and the recording
of eye movements during normal reading. The
extensive literature concerned with contextual
influences on lexical processing divides into
three main strands: (1) lexical priming (single-
word contexts, where the prime-target relation
is semantic or associative in nature); (2) multi-
ple priming (two or more individual lexical
primes); and (3) contextual constraint (the set
of primes is structured by linguistic relation-
ships with one another).
Because these effects are robust and appar-
ently automatic, researchers often seek expla-
nations in terms of low-level mechanisms such
as spreading activation, compound-cue models
(Ratcliff &amp; McKoon, 1988), and distributed
neural network models (Cree, McRae &amp;
McNorgan, 1999; Plaut, 1995). When these
relatively simple models fail to cover every
aspect of the behavioral data, one response has
been to develop theories that meld several
mechanisms (Keefe &amp; Neely, 1990). Another
response is to prefer simplicity over detailed
explanatory power. Plaut and Booth (2000),
for example, make no claim about their net-
work model&apos;s ability to account for blocking
and strategy effects, arguing that it would de-
tract from the main point of their work to focus
on these, which may in any case be due to
other mechanisms.
We present a model even simpler than Plaut
and Booth&apos;s. We demonstrate that distribu-
tional information available from the linguistic
environment — information about word usage
that is inherent in large language corpora — can
capture salient aspects of a range of data from
the literature. It is not necessary to invoke dis-
tinct mechanisms for the different priming set-
tings. Furthermore, we did not need to vary the
independently tunable parameters of our algo-
rithm in order to obtain our results. The same
model has been used in simulations of eye
movement behavior during reading (McDon-
ald, 2000) and event-related potentials re-
corded from the brain (McDonald &amp; Brew,
2001).

The normal setting for speech processing is an
environment in which acoustic cues are unreli-
able or absent, so it makes sense for the hearer
to draw upon available resources in order to
maximize the chances of successful compre-
hension. Such resources include any prior
knowledge that the hearer might have about
what the speaker will say next.
One way to encode prior knowledge is to
construct probabilistically weighted hypotheses
about the meaning of upcoming words. Our
model, which we call the ICE model (for In-
cremental Construction of semantic Expecta-
tions), is of this type. Specifically, it maintains
a vector of probabilities as its representation of
the current best guess about the likely location
in semantic space of the upcoming word. We
use the semantic space defined by the 500
most frequent content words of the spoken por-
tion of the British National Corpus (BNC-
spoken).
When a word is observed, the system up-
dates its meaning representation to reflect the
newly arrived information. The update mecha-
nism, which uses standard multivariate distri-
butions from Bayesian statistics, is designed to
give greater weight to recent words than to
those far in the past.
A number of studies have tried to uncover
correlations between the similarity structure of
word vectors and measurable indicators of hu-
man performance, such as lexical priming
(e.g., Lund, Burgess &amp; Atchley, 1995;
McDonald &amp; Lowe, 1998) and semantic simi-
larity ratings (McDonald, 2000). The same
representations also play a role in simulations
of children&apos;s vocabulary acquisition and syno-
nym choice tests (Landauer &amp; Dumais, 1997).
All of these studies rely on the basic assump-
tion that word vectors can function as conven-
ient proxies for more highly articulated
semantic representations. Our primary claim is
that word vectors also provide a compact and
perspicuous account of priming phenomena
normally ascribed to a multitude of mecha-
nisms.

The vector representations in Figure 1 encode
the number of times the window five words to
either side of the target word is discovered to
include each of two context words cx and
(Figure 1 shows the semantic space as having
two dimensions, rather than the 500 actually
used in our simulations.) The representations
for the real words are formed by examining the
distribution of context words in the neighbor-
hood of these target words, while the represen-
tation of the null context is derived from the
distribution of context words over the corpus
as a whole. &amp;quot;Sake&amp;quot; is shown as having a distri-
butional representation far from that of the null
context, while &amp;quot;make&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;run&amp;quot; are relatively
close. Therefore we predict that it will be
harder to process &amp;quot;sake&amp;quot; in the null context
than it is to process the other words.
The account of priming: in single word prim-
ing, we need two moves within the semantic
space. Consider the case of the word &amp;quot;metal&amp;quot;
being primed by the word &amp;quot;bronze&amp;quot;, as shown
in Figure 2. The first step moves the system&apos;s
hypothesis away from the null context. The
resulting intermediate position is shown as the
diagonal of the quadrilateral linking &amp;quot;metal&amp;quot; to
the origin and the null context.

<bodyText confidence="0.999960642857143">
In the second step, the system needs to move
from the intermediate position to the final posi-
tion, which is the vector representation of the
target word. The relative entropy between the
intermediate position and the target distribu-
tion is our simulation of the effort expended by
the lexical processor in understanding the
word.
The model: Our model is Bayesian; the vec-
tors shown in the diagrams are summaries of
its ongoing estimates of the underlying high-
dimensional probability distribution that gives
rise to the observed distribution of co-
occurring context words. This licenses the use
of relative entropy, which we employ as the
primary dependent variable in our simulations
of semantic context effects. Because every dis-
tribution that we consider involves a contribu-
tion from a highly unspecific distribution
associated with the null context, there are no
zeroes in the distributions, and relative entropy
can be used directly, with no need for smooth-
ing.
The distributions: We can simulate mean-
ings using multinomials — computing relative
entropy by comparing entries in the 500-
dimensional vectors associated with the con-
text words — but to model the dynamic proc-
esses involved in semantic priming we need to
represent more than just the maximum of the
likelihood. We also want to model the extent to
which the lexical processor is committed to the
hypothesis that the target will be found in the
location that we expect.
For reasons of simplicity we prefer distribu-
tions that have convenient analytical properties
and concise parametric representations. One
such is the Dirichlet distribution, which is
widely used in Bayesian statistics (Gelman,
Carlin, Stern &amp; Rubin, 1995). We begin with
prior information expressed in the form of a
Dirichlet, then update it with data drawn from
a multinomial. The resulting posterior distribu-
tion is also a Dirichlet, albeit one whose pa-
rameters have been adjusted to better fit the
recently observed data. This closure property
(known in the statistical literature as conju-
gacy) is crucial to our application, since it al-
lows us to model both prior and posterior
hypotheses in the same way.
The difference between the Dirichlet and the
multinomial is that the latter is parameterized
by a vector of probabilities, subject to the con-
straint that the sum must be zero, while the
Dirichlet is specified by a vector of arbitrary
real-valued weights, subject to no such con-
straint. It represents both a direction in seman-
tic space and the number of &amp;quot;virtual samples&amp;quot;
on which the estimate of that direction is
based. It can therefore be used in priming
simulations to represent both the current best
guess about the upcoming word&apos;s position in
semantic space and the strength with which
this belief is held.
We need to decide how the balance will be
struck between the prior and the incoming new
word, and we need to implement some dis-
counting strategy to prevent the weight given
to the prior from increasing without limit and
overwhelming the incoming data.
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.995274">
Figure 3: Discounting
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.998950078125">
To avoid this, we first add together the vectors
corresponding to the two words, then shrink
the result, as shown in Figure 3. The sum of
the two word vectors is the full diagonal of the
quadrilateral, while the shrunken version is just
the bold part of the diagonal.
Model parameters: The ICE model has two
free parameters. The first parameter deter-
mines how much weight should be given to
prior information. Recall that the ICE model
forms its probabilistically weighted hypotheses
by integrating prior knowledge (derived from
previous words in the context) with new data
(the currently encountered word). For example,
if the sum of the prior weights is 1000, and the
results of 100 new &amp;quot;multinomial trials&amp;quot; are
recorded, prior knowledge is deemed ten times
more important to the outcome than the newly
arrived evidence.
After every update we scale the total prior
weight so that it is constant. This produces a
straightforward discounting of old information,
and is the simplest approach that we could find
that has this biologically plausible property.
We set the total prior weight parameter to
2000 by maximizing the predictive probability
of a small corpus (see McDonald, 2000, for
details).
The second parameter is the scheme for de-
termining the weight to be given to the incom-
ing word. We could have given words weight
in proportion to their frequency, but that would
have given undue weight to frequent words.
We therefore used a fixed size sample, setting
the sample size parameter to 500. Thus, our
model weights prior context as four times more
significant than the incoming word. We have
tested the sensitivity of our results to variations
in this parameter, and the results are not sig-
nificantly impacted by any but the largest
changes. Although there are certainly other
conceivable discounting schemes, this one is
simple, robust, and easy to apply.
This tells us how to generate the vectors for
the intermediate stage of the priming process,
producing new positions in the semantic space.
We compare this positions using relative en-
tropy, just as if they were ordinary multinomi-
als. Although it is only an approximation, it
works well, as the results below demonstrate.
The account of multiple priming: with the
Dirichlet-based simulation of priming in hand,
the simulation of multiple priming is easy. We
just need three steps instead of two.
Reaction time modeling: Our Bayesian meas-
ure is only one of the components that would
be needed in a full mechanistic model of hu-
man reaction time (RT) behavior. To do justice
to the richness of RT data, one would need to
model not only the effects of informational
context but also those of time pressure and ex-
perimental setup. Our model could be used, for
example, to parameterize a diffusion model
(Ratcliff &amp; Smith, 2004).

3.1 Simulation 1: single-word priming
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999985096774194">
The first test of the ICE model was to simulate
the results of Hodgson&apos;s (1991) single-word
lexical priming study. We tested the hypothesis
that a minimal priming context — a single word
— would have a reliable effect on the amount of
information conveyed by the target word, and
that this effect would pattern with the human
behavioral data. Specifically, we predicted that
a related prime word (such as value) would
reduce the relative entropy of a target word
(like worth), compared with an unrelated prime
(such as tolerate). The difference in ICE val-
ues resulting from the divergent influence of
the related and unrelated prime words on the
form of the posterior distribution was expected
to correspond to the difference in lexical deci-
sion response times reported by Hodgson
(1991, Experiment 1).
Hodgson (1991) employed prime-target
pairs representing a wide range of lexical rela-
tions: antonyms (e.g., enemy-friend), syno-
nyms (e.g., dread-fear), conceptual associates
(e.g., teacher-class), phrasal associates (e.g.,
mountain-range), category co-ordinates (e.g.,
coffee-milk) and superordinate-subordinates
(e.g., travel-drive). Hodgson found equivalent
priming effects for all six types of lexical rela-
tion, indicating that priming was not restricted
to particular types of prime-target relation,
such as the category member stimuli employed
by the majority of semantic priming studies.

<bodyText confidence="0.999176227272727">
From the 144 original prime-target pairs listed
in Hodgson (1991, Appendix), 48 were re-
moved because either the prime or the target
word (or both) had a lexeme frequency of less
than 25 occurrences in the BNC-spoken. The
reliability of co-occurrence vector representa-
tions decreases with word frequency (McDon-
ald &amp; Shillcock, 2001), making it preferable to
refrain from collecting statistics for low-
frequency words. The number of items remain-
ing in each Lexical Relation condition after
frequency thresholding is displayed in Table 1.
The ICE value for each Related prime-target
combination was calculated using the model
parameter settings detailed earlier. The corre-
sponding value for each Unrelated item was
computed as the mean of the ICE values for
the target word paired with each of the other
primes in the Lexical Relation condition.&apos; For
example, each Unrelated datapoint in the An-
tonym condition was computed as the mean of
15 ICE values.

We conducted a two-way analysis of variance
on the simulated priming data generated by the
ICE model. The factors were Lexical Relation
(antonyms, synonyms, conceptual associates,
phrasal associates, category co-ordinates, su-
perordinate-subordinates) and Context (related,
unrelated). ICE values for each cell of the de-
sign are presented in Table 1. (ICE values can
be considered analogous to reaction times, the
smaller the value, the shorter the RT). As ex-

relative entropy was significantly less when
the target is preceded by a related prime than
when it is preceded by an unrelated prime:

3.2 Simulation 2: multiple priming
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99997005882353">
Simulation 1 demonstrated that single-word
lexical priming can be modeled as the influ-
ence of the local linguistic context on the
quantity of information conveyed by a word
about its contextual behavior. In Simulation 2,
we submit the ICE model to a more stringent
test: the lexical priming situation where more
than one prime word is presented before the
target. The multiple priming paradigm — the
procedure by which two or more lexical primes
precede the target word — is a natural extension
of the single-word priming task. Multiple
priming can be seen as occupying the middle
ground between the lexical priming and con-
textual constraint paradigms. In multiple prim-
ing experiments, the prime words are presented
as unstructured lists, but in contextual con-
straint studies, whole sentences are presented
in their original order, and the usual cues to
syntactic structure are present. Despite the fact
that multiple primes do not form a syntacti-
cally coherent unit, research by Balota and
Paul (1996) and others has shown that two (or
more) primes are better than one.
Balota and Paul were interested in how mul-
tiple primes — construed as independent
sources of spreading activation — influenced
target word processing. Using two-word con-
texts, they separately manipulated the related-
ness of each prime to the target word; this
procedure allowed additive priming effects to
be accurately measured. In their first experi-
ment, they demonstrated that the multiple-
prime advantage was additive: the facilitation
obtained in the two-related-primes condition
(RR) was equivalent to the sum of the facilita-
tion for the one-related-prime conditions (UR
and RU). (See Table 2 for sample stimuli). Be-
cause they found evidence for simple additiv-
ity using a range of prime presentation
durations and both lexical decision and naming
as response tasks (Balota &amp; Paul, 1996, Ex-
periments 1-5), the authors state that &amp;quot;... we

prime advantage.

The design was identical to that of Balota and
Paul&apos;s Experiment 1. This was a 2 x 4 mixed fac-
tors design, with Type of Target (homograph,
category label) as the between-items factor, and
Prime Type (RR, UR, RU, UU) as the within-
items factor.
Preparation of the lexical stimuli was very
similar to the procedure carried out in Simulation
1. Inflected stimuli were first converted to their
canonical forms, and items containing target or
related prime words that did not meet the 25-
occurrence frequency threshold were removed.
Unrelated prime words that failed to meet the
frequency threshold were replaced with unrelated
primes randomly chosen from the set of dis-

items, 69 could be used in the simulation. Out of
the 94 original category stimuli, 39 met the fre-

As in Simulation 1, facilitation was simulated by
a reduction in relative entropy in one of the Re-
lated prime conditions (RR, RU and UR), com-
pared with the UU (two-unrelated-primes)
condition. Facilitation was apparent for all three
Related conditions. The size of the context effect
was 0.110 bits for the RR condition, 0.041 bits
for the UR condition, and 0.079 bits for the RU
condition. These differences in mean ICE value
were verified by an analysis of variance, which
revealed a main effect of Prime Type,
F(3,306)=40.53, MSE=0.0058, p&lt;0.001. There
was no reliable effect of Target Type.
The pattern of results was closely comparable
to the human data. As expected, the strongest
context effect was observed in the RR condition,
which was larger than the effects in both the UR
and RU conditions. This result replicates the mul-
tiple-prime advantage reported by Balota and
Paul. The results of the ICE simulation did not
match the human data completely; specifically,
the context effect for the RU targets was larger
than for the UR targets, whereas the pattern ob-
served in human subjects was the opposite. This
difference between the RU and UR conditions
was statistically reliable: planned comparisons
(with suitable alpha corrections) confirmed that
all four conditions differed reliably from one
other, at the a=0.05 level of significance. We
investigated further. Briefly, it appears that the
discrepancy may be an artifact of the particular
choice of experimental materials. The larger
simulated priming effect for the RU condition
was probably due to the differences between the
Prime-1 words and the Prime-2 words.

4 Conclusions and future work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999909375">
Our approach is simple, and involves few tunable
parameters, and so lends itself to exploratory
work and to the generation of clear and testable
hypotheses. It is straightforward, given a large
corpus and a sufficiently precise working hy-
pothesis, to create sets of stimulus materials that
should produce context effects, and to test them
using human participants. Because of the multi-
plicity of relevant linking relations evidenced by
Hodgson, 1991, this would be harder to do in a
spreading activation framework.
Another avenue for exploration is to use the
combination of ICE and the refined lexical rela-
tions encoded in WordNet to create materials that
would allow a larger scale replication of the re-
sults of Hodgson (1991). Such replication is in-
dependently desirable, since new reaction times
would address the potential objection that we
have unintentionally tuned our method to Hodg-
son&apos;s data. In the same vein, since our distribu-
tional methods provide a cheap and easy tool for
exploratory studies, we intend to look more
closely at the reasons for the discrepancies be-
tween our results and those of Balota and Paul
(1996).
The present simulations show that a range of
contextual effects can be subsumed under the
same distributional mechanism, and that no task
specific tuning of the parameters is necessary.
Our model is computationally efficient and us-
able on a large scale to mine corpora for poten-
tially interesting experimental materials.

<abstract confidence="0.999073375">One of the most robust findings of experimental psycholinguistics is that the context in which a word is presented influences the effort involved in processing that word. We present a computational model of contextual facilitation based on word co-occurrence vectors, and empirically validate the model through simulation of three representative types of context manipulation: single word priming, multiple-priming and contextual constraint. The aim of our study is to find out whether special-purpose mechanisms are necessary in order to capture the pattern of the experimental results.</abstract>

Multiple priming can be seen as occupying the middle ground between the lexical priming and contextual constraint paradigms. In multiple priming experiments, the prime words are presented as unstructured lists, but in contextual constraint studies, whole sentences are presented in their original order, and the usual cues to syntactic structure are present. Despite the fact that multiple primes do not form a syntactically coherent unit, research by Balota and Paul (1996) and others has shown that two (or more) primes are better than one. Balota and Paul were interested in how multiple primes — construed as independent sources of spreading activation — influenced target word processing. Using two-word contexts, they separately manipulated the relatedness of each prime to the target word; this procedure allowed additive priming effects to be accurately measured. In their first experiment, they demonstrated that the multipleprime advantage was additive: the facilitation obtained in the two-related-primes condition (RR) was equivalent to the sum of the facilitati</context>

Another avenue for exploration is to use the combination of ICE and the refined lexical relations encoded in WordNet to create materials that would allow a larger scale replication of the results of Hodgson (1991). Such replication is independently desirable, since new reaction times would address the potential objection that we have unintentionally tuned our method to Hodgson&apos;s data. In the same vein, since our distributional methods provide a cheap and easy tool for exploratory studies, we intend to look more closely at the reasons for the discrepancies between our results and those of Balota and Paul (1996). The present simulations show that a range of contextual effects can be subsumed under the same distributional mechanism, and that no task specific tuning of the parameters is necessary. Our model is computationally efficient and usable on a large scale to mine corpora for potentially interesting experimental materials.

Specifically, we predicted that a related prime word (such as value) would reduce the relative entropy of a target word (like worth), compared with an unrelated prime (such as tolerate). The difference in ICE values resulting from the divergent influence of the related and unrelated prime words on the form of the posterior distribution was expected to correspond to the difference in lexical decision response times reported by Hodgson (1991, Experiment 1). Hodgson (1991) employed prime-target pairs representing a wide range of lexical relations: antonyms (e.g., enemy-friend), synonyms (e.g., dread-fear), conceptual associates (e.g., teacher-class), phrasal associates (e.g., mountain-range), category co-ordinates (e.g., coffee-milk) and superordinate-subordinates (e.g., travel-drive). Hodgson found equivalent priming effects for all six types of lexical relation, indicating that priming was not restricted to particular types of prime-target relation, such as the category member stimuli employed by the majority of semantic priming</context>

There was no main effect of Lexical Relation: F(5,90)&lt;1, and importantly, no evidence for a Lexical Relation x Context interaction: F(5,90)&lt;1. Separate ANOVAs conducted for each type of Relation showed consistent, reliable priming effects for all six relations As was the case for human subjects, Context did not interact with Lexical Relation. There is no evidence here for different mechanisms for Because the unrelated primes corresponding to each target word were not supplied in Hodgson (1991), we used this technique to simulate the unrelated Context condition. An alternative would be to select a prime word at random from the other items in the same condition to serve as the unrelated prime; both methods give the same results. the different types of word-to-word relations. We know that ICE is using nothing but distributional information, and it could be that human subjects are doing the same. 3.2 Simulation 2: multiple priming Simulation 1 demonstrated that single-word lexical priming can be modeled as the influence of the local linguistic context on the quantity of information con</context>

It is straightforward, given a large corpus and a sufficiently precise working hypothesis, to create sets of stimulus materials that should produce context effects, and to test them using human participants. Because of the multiplicity of relevant linking relations evidenced by Hodgson, 1991, this would be harder to do in a spreading activation framework. Another avenue for exploration is to use the combination of ICE and the refined lexical relations encoded in WordNet to create materials that would allow a larger scale replication of the results of Hodgson (1991).

Because these effects are robust and apparently automatic, researchers often seek explanations in terms of low-level mechanisms such as spreading activation, compound-cue models (Ratcliff &amp; McKoon, 1988), and distributed neural network models (Cree, McRae &amp; McNorgan, 1999; Plaut, 1995). When these relatively simple models fail to cover every aspect of the behavioral data, one response has been to develop theories that meld several mechanisms (Keefe &amp; Neely, 1990). Another response is to prefer simplicity over detailed explanatory power. Plaut and Booth (2000), for example, make no claim about their network model&apos;s ability to account for blocking and strategy effects, arguing that it would detract from the main point of their work to focus on these, which may in any case be due to other mechanisms.

We demonstrate that distributional information available from the linguistic environment — information about word usage that is inherent in large language corpora — can capture salient aspects of a range of data from the literature. It is not necessary to invoke distinct mechanisms for the different priming settings. Furthermore, we did not need to vary the independently tunable parameters of our algorithm in order to obtain our results. The same model has been used in simulations of eye movement behavior during reading (McDonald, 2000) and event-related potentials recorded from the brain (McDonald &amp; Brew, 2001). 2 Distributional models The normal setting for speech processing is an environment in which acoustic cues are unreliable or absent, so it makes sense for the hearer to draw upon available resources in order to maximize the chances of successful comprehension. Such resources include any prior knowledge that the hearer might have about what the speaker will say next. One way to encode prior knowledge is to construct probabilistically weighted hypotheses about the meaning of upcoming words. Our model, which we call the</context>

When a word is observed, the system updates its meaning representation to reflect the newly arrived information. The update mechanism, which uses standard multivariate distributions from Bayesian statistics, is designed to give greater weight to recent words than to those far in the past.

For example, if the sum of the prior weights is 1000, and the results of 100 new &amp;quot;multinomial trials&amp;quot; are recorded, prior knowledge is deemed ten times more important to the outcome than the newly arrived evidence. After every update we scale the total prior weight so that it is constant. This produces a straightforward discounting of old information, and is the simplest approach that we could find that has this biologically plausible property. We set the total prior weight parameter to 2000 by maximizing the predictive probability of a small corpus (see McDonald, 2000, for details). The second parameter is the scheme for determining the weight to be given to the incoming word. We could have given words weight in proportion to their frequency, but that would have given undue weight to frequent words. We therefore used a fixed size sample, setting the sample size parameter to 500. Thus, our model weights prior context as four times more significant than the incoming word. We have tested the sensitivity of our results to variations in this parameter, and the results are not significantly impacted by any but the largest changes. Although there are certainly ot</context>

To do justice to the richness of RT data, one would need to model not only the effects of informational context but also those of time pressure and experimental setup. Our model could be used, for example, to parameterize a diffusion model (Ratcliff &amp; Smith, 2004). 3 Simulations We used the same model settings for three experiments, of which two are reported here. The third is simulation of a contextual constraint study by Altarriba, Kroll, Sholl and Rayner (1996). This is described in a longer version of the present paper (McDonald &amp; Brew, 2002). 3.1 Simulation 1: single-word priming The first test of the ICE model was to simulate the results of Hodgson&apos;s (1991) single-word lexical priming study. We tested the hypothesis that a minimal priming context — a single word — would have a reliable effect on the amount of information conveyed by the target word, and that this effect would pattern with the human behavioral data.

We demonstrate that distributional information available from the linguistic environment — information about word usage that is inherent in large language corpora — can capture salient aspects of a range of data from the literature. It is not necessary to invoke distinct mechanisms for the different priming settings. Furthermore, we did not need to vary the independently tunable parameters of our algorithm in order to obtain our results. The same model has been used in simulations of eye movement behavior during reading (McDonald, 2000) and event-related potentials recorded from the brain (McDonald &amp; Brew, 2001). 2 Distributional models The normal setting for speech processing is an environment in which acoustic cues are unreliable or absent, so it makes sense for the hearer to draw upon available resources in order to maximize the chances of successful comprehension. Such resources include any prior knowledge that the hearer might have about what the speaker will say next. One way to encode prior knowledge is to construct probabilistically weighted hypotheses about the meaning of upcoming words. Our model, which we call the ICE model (for Incremental Construction of semantic Expectations), is of thi</context>

When a word is observed, the system updates its meaning representation to reflect the newly arrived information. The update mechanism, which uses standard multivariate distributions from Bayesian statistics, is designed to give greater weight to recent words than to those far in the past. A number of studies have tried to uncover correlations between the similarity structure of word vectors and measurable indicators of human performance, such as lexical priming (e.g., Lund, Burgess &amp; Atchley, 1995; McDonald &amp; Lowe, 1998) and semantic similarity ratings (McDonald, 2000). The same representations also play a role in simulations of children&apos;s vocabulary acquisition and synonym choice tests (Landauer &amp; Dumais, 1997). All of these studies rely on the basic assumption that word vectors can function as convenient proxies for more highly articulated semantic representations. Our primary claim is that word vectors also provide a compact and perspicuous account of priming phenomena normally ascribed to a multitude of mechanisms. 2.1 The ICE model We use a vector-based representation of the &amp;quot;best-guess&amp;quot; hypothesis about</context>

Hodgson found equivalent priming effects for all six types of lexical relation, indicating that priming was not restricted to particular types of prime-target relation, such as the category member stimuli employed by the majority of semantic priming studies. Method From the 144 original prime-target pairs listed in Hodgson (1991, Appendix), 48 were removed because either the prime or the target word (or both) had a lexeme frequency of less than 25 occurrences in the BNC-spoken. The reliability of co-occurrence vector representations decreases with word frequency (McDonald &amp; Shillcock, 2001), making it preferable to refrain from collecting statistics for lowfrequency words. The number of items remaining in each Lexical Relation condition after frequency thresholding is displayed in Table 1. The ICE value for each Related prime-target combination was calculated using the model parameter settings detailed earlier. The corresponding value for each Unrelated item was computed as the mean of the ICE values for the target word paired with each of the other primes in the Lexical Relation condition.&apos; For example, each Unrelated datapoint in the Antonym condition was computed as the mean </context>

The aim of our study is to find out whether special-purpose mechanisms are necessary in order to capture the pattern of the experimental results. 1 Introduction In psycholinguistics, lexical access is the process of retrieving a word from the mental lexicon using perceptual and contextual information. In everyday life, the point of this process is to facilitate communication. Many different experimental methodologies have been brought to bear on the study of this process, including visual and auditory lexical decision tasks (e.g., Meyer &amp; Schvaneveldt, 1971; Moss, Ostrin, Tyler &amp; Marslen-Wilson, 1995), event-related brain potentials (e.g., Brown, Hagoort &amp; Chwilla, 2000), and the recording of eye movements during normal reading. The extensive literature concerned with contextual influences on lexical processing divides into three main strands: (1) lexical priming (singleword contexts, where the prime-target relation is semantic or associative in nature); (2) multiple priming (two or more individual lexical primes); and (3) contextual constraint (the set of primes is structured by linguistic relationships with one another).

Because these effects are robust and apparently automatic, researchers often seek explanations in terms of low-level mechanisms such as spreading activation, compound-cue models (Ratcliff &amp; McKoon, 1988), and distributed neural network models (Cree, McRae &amp; McNorgan, 1999; Plaut, 1995). When these relatively simple models fail to cover every aspect of the behavioral data, one response has been to develop theories that meld several mechanisms (Keefe &amp; Neely, 1990). Another response is to prefer simplicity over detailed explanatory power. Plaut and Booth (2000), for example, make no claim about their network model&apos;s ability to account for blocking and strategy effects, arguing that it would detract from the main point of their work to focus on these, which may in any case be due to other mechanisms.

The account of multiple priming: with the Dirichlet-based simulation of priming in hand, the simulation of multiple priming is easy. We just need three steps instead of two. Reaction time modeling: Our Bayesian measure is only one of the components that would be needed in a full mechanistic model of human reaction time (RT) behavior. To do justice to the richness of RT data, one would need to model not only the effects of informational context but also those of time pressure and experimental setup. Our model could be used, for example, to parameterize a diffusion model (Ratcliff &amp; Smith, 2004). 3 Simulations We used the same model settings for three experiments, of which two are reported here. The third is simulation of a contextual constraint study by Altarriba, Kroll, Sholl and Rayner (1996). This is described in a longer version of the present paper (McDonald &amp; Brew, 2002). 3.1 Simulation 1: single-word priming The first test of the ICE model was to simulate the results of Hodgson&apos;s (1991) single-word lexical priming study. We tested the hypothesis that a minimal priming context — a single word — would have a reliable effect on the amount of information conveyed by the target wo</context>
