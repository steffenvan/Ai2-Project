Sproat’s book is an enjoyable collection of loosely connected discussions on writing
systems and their decipherment, ancient and modern speech technology, and machine
translation. The book arose from a course on Language, Technology, and Society but
it’s definitely not a textbook—instead of broad coverage, it offers a few enjoyable in-
depth discussions. In fact, it feels somewhat like a coffee-table book for computational
linguists.
The book starts off by showing how language and tool creation and use are both
peculiar characteristics of human beings. This leads nicely into the theme of language
technology as a combination of these distinctive human traits. Chapter 2 then presents
writing as the first case of language technology, contrasting writing with other symbolic
systems.
Chapter 3 gives a detailed discussion of how writing represents language. The main
point is that writing systems all end up basically representing sound. This is true even
though writing appears to have been independently invented in at least three places,
and has a huge variety of forms, with many differences in script type, glyph combi-
nation, and direction. Sproat argues convincingly, with examples from many different
languages, that sound is the level represented because it is only at this level that there
are few enough units to be remembered—syllables, words, concepts, or phrases are too
numerous.
Sproat next discusses the decipherment of writing systems where the mapping from
symbol to sound has been lost. Sproat starts with the classic case of hieroglyphics,
deciphered with the help of the parallel text on the Rosetta stone. He then discusses
potential scripts with fewer extant samples, emphasizing the point that we may never
be able to decipher some of them—without some gold standard we can never know
whether the mapping produced is actually correct. Indeed, for those sets of symbols for
which we have limited data and no linking to other texts, we may never know whether
they are even writing systems.
The following chapter talks about writing, literacy, and technology. Sproat shows
that complexity of a script appears to have little to do with literacy—general measures
of well being (such as health and schooling) are much more important. The chapter ends
with a very speculative discussion of the danger of losing the permanence of writing (as
in Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four) and returning to a culture where we have no reliable
records.
Chapter 6 gives a brief history of mechanized speech and language technology. It
begins with a detailed description of early attempts at speech synthesis and typewriters,
and then discusses telegraphy, computer encoding of text, and Braille. Chapter 7 then
moves to an overview of modern speech technology including both recognition and

synthesis. This section presents the state of the art without losing the reader in technical
details. It is very clearly written, well referenced, and authoritative.
Chapter 8 is mainly about machine translation. It combines a balanced historical
discussion of research and development in machine translation with a very accessible
introduction to statistical machine translation. It is a pity that the same level of detail
couldn’t have been extended to other fields of natural language processing, such as
information retrieval and question answering.
The book finishes with a discussion of the future of language technology. The first
section of the closing chapter predicts how language technology, especially speech
technology, will improve in the near future. This section includes a good discussion
of the importance of investment in developing technology—not everything that could
be done will be; the greatest improvement will be seen in those areas in which people
are prepared to invest time and money. It was nice to see this often neglected topic
addressed. The final section talks about the social implications of language technology,
warning that they are not all positive.
Overall the book is a pleasure to read,1 with well-chosen illustrations, nice exam-
ples, illuminating illustrations, and numerous examples of different writing systems.
The author is clearly knowledgeable about writing systems, especially the decipher-
ment of scripts with little extant text, as well as speech processing, his main field of
research. These sections are very clearly written, well referenced, and authoritative. The
sections on the social implications are more speculative.
The book’s weakness is that the coverage is very idiosyncratic. For example, there is
almost no discussion of printing, which is surely one of the great language technologies.
In contrast, several fairly minor topics, such as Blissymbolics and the Phaistos disc,
are treated very thoroughly. In particular, there is no discussion on the bandwidth and
compressibility of various scripts and almost nothing on computer-mediated commu-
nication and its effect on language. For a book on language and technology published
in 2010, this is a disappointment. The structure is also a little inconsistent: Chapters 3
and 6 have summaries, Chapter 7 has a synopsis, and the rest just finish.
In summary, Sproat’s book is an enjoyable collection of essays on language, tech-
nology, and society, but still leaves room for a more definitive tome.
