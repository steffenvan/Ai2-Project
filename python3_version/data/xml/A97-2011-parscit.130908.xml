The Natural Language Processing (NLP)
group at Microsoft Research has been
working for over five years on the
development of a broad-coverage NL
understanding system. In the last two
years, the NLP group has been joined by
the World Languages Research group,
whose current mission is to extend the
NLP group&apos;s technology to both
European and Far-Eastern languages,
and by the Natural Language
Development group, which is
responsible for transferring the
technology into Microsoft products.
The presentation will provide a brief
overview and demonstration of the
components that comprise the Microsoft
NLP technology, including the syntactic
parser, logical form component, and
lexical knowledge base (MindNet).
There will also be a description of how
the three NL groups at Microsoft have
collaborated successfully to move the
technology into real world products.
In particular, the grammar checker
integrated in Microsoft Word 97 (also
included in Office 97), which was
released in January of this year,
incorporates the NLP group&apos;s syntactic
parser. It is envisioned that this very
general and flexible component, together
with the other components under
development, will provide the basis for
many NL-enabled functions as well as
specific applications other than grammar
checking.
The grammar checker will be
demonstrated in the context of Word 97,
showing a number of the errors it detects
and some of the rewrites it suggests.
Some usability and integration issues,
such as background processing, will also
be discussed. Finally, there will be a
brief demonstration of the grammar
checking functionality in the context of
the more general NL understanding
system.
