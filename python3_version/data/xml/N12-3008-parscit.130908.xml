This paper presents a demonstration of a tem-
poral reasoning system that addresses three
fundamental tasks related to temporal expres-
sions in text: extraction, normalization to time
intervals and comparison. Our system makes
use of an existing state-of-the-art temporal ex-
traction system, on top of which we add sev-
eral important novel contributions. In addi-
tion, we demonstrate that our system can per-
form temporal reasoning by comparing nor-
malized temporal expressions with respect
to several temporal relations. Experimental
study shows that the system achieves excellent
performance on all the tasks we address.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998947333333333">
Performing temporal reasoning with respect to tem-
poral expressions is important in many NLP tasks
such as text summarization, information extraction,
discourse understanding and information retrieval.
Recently, the Knowledge Base Population track (Ji
et al., 2011) introduced the temporal slot filling task
that requires identifying and extracting temporal in-
formation for a limited set of binary relations such as
(person, employee of), (person, spouse). In the work
of (Wang et al., 2010), the authors presented the
Timely Yago ontology, which extracted and incorpo-
rated temporal information as part of the description
of the events and relations in the ontology. Temporal
reasoning is also essential in supporting the emerg-
ing temporal information retrieval research direction
(Alonso et al., 2011).
In this paper, we present a system that addresses
three fundamental tasks in temporal reasoning:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.98764575">
• Extraction: Capturing the extent of time expres-
sions in a given text. This task is based on task A in
the TempEval-2 challenge (Verhagen et al., 2010).
Consider the following sentence:
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.975664384615385">
Seventy-five million copies of the rifle have been
built since it entered production in February 1947.
In this sentence, February 1947 is a basic temporal
expression that should be extracted by the extraction
module. More importantly, we further extend the
task to support also the extraction of complex tem-
poral expressions that are not addressed by existing
systems. In the example above, it is important to rec-
ognize and capture the phrase since it entered pro-
duction in February 1947 as another temporal ex-
pression that expresses the time period of the manu-
facturing event (triggered by built.) For the best of
our knowledge, this extension is novel.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.98132294117647">
• Normalization: Normalizing temporal expres-
sions, which are extracted by the extraction module,
to a canonical form. Our system normalizes tem-
poral expressions (including complex ones) to time
intervals of the form [start point, end point]. The
endpoints follow a standard date and time format:
YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss. Our system accounts for
an input reference date when performing the normal-
ization. For example, given March 20th, 1947 as a
reference date, our system normalizes the temporal
expressions extracted in the example above as fol-
lows: [1947-02-01 00:00:00, 1947-02-28 23:59:59]
and [1947-02-01 00:00:00, 1947-03-20 23:59:59],
respectively.
• Comparison: Comparing two time intervals
(i.e. normalized temporal expressions). This mod-
ule identifies the temporal relation that holds be-

tween intervals, including the before, before-and-
overlap, containing, equal, inside , after and after-
and-overlap relations. For example, when compar-
ing the two normalized time intervals above, we get
the following result: [1947-02-01 00:00:00, 1947-
02-28 23:59:59] is inside [1947-02-01 00:00:00,
1947-03-20 23:59:59].
There has been much work addressing the prob-
lems of temporal expression extraction and normal-
ization, i.e. the systems developed in TempEval-2
challenge (Verhagen et al., 2010). However, our sys-
tem is different from them in several aspects. First,
we extend the extraction task to capture complex
temporal expressions. Second, our system normal-
izes temporal expressions (including complex ones)
to time intervals instead of time points. Finally, our
system performs temporal comparison of time inter-
vals with respect to multiple relations. We believe
that with the rapid progress in NLP and IR, more
tasks will require temporal information and reason-
ing, and a system that addresses these three funda-
mental tasks well will be able to support and facili-
tate temporal reasoning systems efficiently.

2 The System

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.996808">
2.1 Temporal Expression Extraction
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9976071">
We built the temporal expression extraction module
on top of the Heideltime system (Str¨otgen and Gertz,
2010) to take advantage of a state-of-the-art tempo-
ral extraction system in capturing basic expressions.
We use the Illinois POS tagger1 (Roth and Zelenko,
1998) to provide part-of-speech tags for the input
text before passing it to HeidelTime. Below is an
example of the HeidelTime output of the example in
the previous section:
Seventy-five million copies of the rifle have been
built since it entered production in &lt;TIMEX3
tid=”t2” type=”DATE” value=”1947-02”&gt;February
1947&lt;/TIMEX3&gt;
In this example, HeidelTime captures a basic tem-
poral expression: February 1947. However, Heidel-
Time cannot capture the complex temporal expres-
sion since it entered production in February 1947,
which expresses a period of time from February
1947 until the document creation time. This is ac-
tually the time period of the manufacturing event

(triggered by built). To capture complex phrases, we
make use of a syntactic parse tree2 as illustrated in
Figure 1. A complex temporal expression is recog-
nized if it satisfies the following conditions:

• It contains at least one basic temporal ex-

pression extracted by HeidelTime.
In addition, our extraction module also handles
holidays in several countries. For example, in
the sentence “The gas price increased rapidly after
Christmas.”, we are able to extract two temporal ex-
pressions Christmas and after Christmas, which re-
fer to different time intervals.

2.2 Normalization to Time Intervals
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999996888888889">
Our system normalizes a temporal expression to a
time interval of the form [start point, end point],
where start point &lt; endpoint. Each time endpoint of
an interval follows a standard date and time format:
YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss. It is worth noting that this
format augments the date format in TimeML, used
by HeidelTime and other existing systems. Our date
and time format of each time endpoint refer to an
absolute time point on a universal timeline, making
our time intervals absolute as well. Furthermore, we
take advantage of the predicted temporal value of
each temporal expression from the HeidelTime out-
put. For instance, in the HeidelTime output example
above, we extract 1947-02 as the normalized date
of February 1947 and then convert it to the inter-
val [1947-02-01 00:00:00, 1947-02-28 23:59:59]. If
HeidelTime cannot identify an exact date, month or
year, we then resort to our own temporal normalizer,

2.3 Comparison

To compare two time intervals (i.e. normalized
temporal expressions), we define six temporal rela-
tions: before, before-and-overlap, contains, equals,
inside, after and after-and-overlap. The temporal
relation between two normalized intervals is deter-
mined by a set of comparison rules that take the four
interval endpoints into consideration. For example,
A = [sA, eA] contains B = [sB, eB] if and only if
(sA &lt; sB) ∧ (eA &gt; eB), where s and e are intervals
start and end points, respectively.

the TimeBank data sets (Pustejovsky et al., 2003).

3.1 Data Preparation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999970833333333">
We focus on scaling up temporal systems to deal
with complex expressions. Therefore, we prepared
an evaluation data set that consists of a list of sen-
tences containing at least one of the five temporal
connectives since, betwen, from, before and after.
To do this, we extract all sentences that satisfy the
condition from 183 articles in the TimeBank 1.2
corpus3. This results in a total of 486 sentences.
Each sentence in the data set comes with the doc-
ument creation time (DCT) of its corresponding ar-
ticle. The second and the third columns of Table
1 summarize the number of sentences and appear-
ances of each temporal connective.
We use this data set to evaluate the extended tem-
poral extractor, the normalizer and also the com-
parator of our system. We note that although this
data set is driven by our focused temporal connec-
tives, it does not lose the generality of evaluating

We report the performance of our extended tem-

ble 1. We evaluate the normalization module on
the correctly extracted temporal expressions, includ-
ing basic expressions captured by HeidelTime and
the extended expressions identified by our extrac-
tor. A normalization is correct if and only if both
time interval endpoints are correctly identified. We
study the comparison module by evaluating it on
the comparisons of the correctly normalized expres-
sions against the corresponding DCT of the sen-
tences from which they are extracted. Because the
normalization and comparison outputs are judged as
correct or incorrect, we report the performance of
these modules in accuracy (Acc) as shown in Ta-
ble 2. Overall, the experimental study shows that
all modules in our system are robust and achieve ex-
cellent performance.

We believe that with the rapid progress in NLP and IR, more tasks will require temporal information and reasoning, and a system that addresses these three fundamental tasks well will be able to support and facilitate temporal reasoning systems efficiently. 2 The System 2.1 Temporal Expression Extraction We built the temporal expression extraction module on top of the Heideltime system (Str¨otgen and Gertz, 2010) to take advantage of a state-of-the-art temporal extraction system in capturing basic expressions. We use the Illinois POS tagger1 (Roth and Zelenko, 1998) to provide part-of-speech tags for the input text before passing it to HeidelTime. Below is an example of the HeidelTime output of the example in the previous section: Seventy-five million copies of the rifle have been built since it entered production in &lt;TIMEX3 tid=”t2” type=”DATE” value=”1947-02”&gt;February 1947&lt;/TIMEX3&gt; In this example, HeidelTime captures a basic temporal expression: February 1947. However, HeidelTime cannot capture the complex temporal expression since it entered production in February 1947, which expresses a period of time from February 1947 until the document creation t</context>

Temporal reasoning is also essential in supporting the emerging temporal information retrieval research direction (Alonso et al., 2011). In this paper, we present a system that addresses three fundamental tasks in temporal reasoning: • Extraction: Capturing the extent of time expressions in a given text. This task is based on task A in the TempEval-2 challenge (Verhagen et al., 2010). Consider the following sentence: Seventy-five million copies of the rifle have been built since it entered production in February 1947. In this sentence, February 1947 is a basic temporal expression that should be extracted by the extraction module. More importantly, we further extend the task to support also the extraction of complex temporal expressions that are not addressed by existing systems. In the example above, it is important to recognize and capture the phrase since it entered production in February 1947 as another temporal expression that expresses the time period of the manufact</context>

For example, when comparing the two normalized time intervals above, we get the following result: [1947-02-01 00:00:00, 1947- 02-28 23:59:59] is inside [1947-02-01 00:00:00, 1947-03-20 23:59:59]. There has been much work addressing the problems of temporal expression extraction and normalization, i.e. the systems developed in TempEval-2 challenge (Verhagen et al., 2010). However, our system is different from them in several aspects. First, we extend the extraction task to capture complex temporal expressions. Second, our system normalizes temporal expressions (including complex ones) to time intervals instead of time points. Finally, our system performs temporal comparison of time intervals with respect to multiple relations. We believe that with the rapid progress in NLP and IR, more tasks will require temporal information and reasoning, and a system that addresses these three fundamental tasks well will be able to support and facilitate temporal reasoning </context>

The temporal relation between two normalized intervals is determined by a set of comparison rules that take the four interval endpoints into consideration. For example, A = [sA, eA] contains B = [sB, eB] if and only if (sA &lt; sB) ∧ (eA &gt; eB), where s and e are intervals start and end points, respectively. 3 Experimental Study In this section, we present an evaluation of our extended temporal extractor, the normalizer and the comparator. We do not evaluate the HeidelTime temporal extractor again because its performance was reported in the TempEval-2 challenge (Verhagen et al., 2010), where it achieved 0.86 Fl score on the TimeBank data sets (Pustejovsky et al., 2003). 3.1 Data Preparation We focus on scaling up temporal systems to deal with complex expressions. Therefore, we prepared an evaluation data set that consists of a list of sentences containing at least one of the five temporal connectives since, betwen, from, before and after. To do this, we extract all sentences that satisfy the condition from 183 articles in the TimeBank 1.2 corpus3. This results in a total of 486 sentences.

Experimental study shows that the system achieves excellent performance on all the tasks we address. 1 Introduction Performing temporal reasoning with respect to temporal expressions is important in many NLP tasks such as text summarization, information extraction, discourse understanding and information retrieval. Recently, the Knowledge Base Population track (Ji et al., 2011) introduced the temporal slot filling task that requires identifying and extracting temporal information for a limited set of binary relations such as (person, employee of), (person, spouse). In the work of (Wang et al., 2010), the authors presented the Timely Yago ontology, which extracted and incorporated temporal information as part of the description of the events and relations in the ontology. Temporal reasoning is also essential in supporting the emerging temporal information retrieval research direction (Alonso et al., 2011). In this paper, we present a system that addresses three fundamental tasks in temporal reasoning: • Extraction: Capturing the extent of time expressions in a given text.
