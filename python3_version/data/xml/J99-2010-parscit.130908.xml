This timely book joins the growing number of leading introductory volumes on cor-
pus linguistics, including McEnery and Wilson (1996) and Biber, Conrad, and Reppen
(1998). The former volume represents the first-ever introductory textbook on corpus
linguistics; the latter, also recently published, is strong on reporting many of the au-
thors&apos; own analyses of speech and writing and providing &amp;quot;methodology boxes&amp;quot; for
the computer processing of text using the corpus-based paradigm. Space constraints
do not permit the comparison of all three volumes, especially in relation to the use of
the corpus-based approach for natural language processing. In the present instance, it
is to his credit that Graeme Kennedy has single-handedly achieved the difficult task
of systematically providing an historical overview and evaluating the significance of
many important studies that currently define the corpus-based approach.
The book is organized as follows:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.994306083333333">
1. Introduction (12 pages); the chapter includes the notion of a corpus and
the scope of corpus linguistics.
2. The design and development of corpora (75 pages); the chapter includes
the types of corpora, corpus design, representativeness, and markup.
3. Corpus-based descriptions of English (116 pages); the chapter details the
results of various studies of corpora from lexical, grammatical,
pragmatic, and language-variation perspectives.
4. Corpus analysis (64 pages); the chapter includes some common
corpus-based software, including software for corpus annotation, search,
concordancing, and retrieval.
5. Implications and applications of corpus-based analysis (27 pages); the
chapter includes a treatment of language as &amp;quot;possibility&amp;quot; and

&amp;quot;probability&amp;quot; and, from these two complementary perspectives, how the
corpus-based approach relates to the practice of computational
linguistics, language teaching, and computer-assisted language learning.
Kennedy&apos;s choice of treatment of these chapters clearly indicates the precedence
of linguistic issues over computing ones. Indeed, for him, &amp;quot;the most important skill
is not to be able to program a computer or even to manipulate available software ...

[but] to be able to ask insightful questions which address real issues and problems
in theoretical, descriptive and applied language studies&amp;quot; (p. 3). Notwithstanding this
preference, Chapter 3 does introduce the reader to a range of computer software for
the linguistic analysis of text, including software for lemmatization, word-class tag-
ging, semantic tagging, parsing, and concordancing. While Kennedy&apos;s main aim is to
introduce the reader to the linguistic rationale behind the processing and refer the
reader to the relevant sources for further understanding of the software, he does take
pains also to introduce the reader to the actual operations of the software. For instance,
in his treatment of Lancaster&apos;s CLAWS word-tagging system, he details the evolution
of this software from the first version of the tag set to the C5 tag set. He also details
the modular components of the software and provides a number of figures of the pro-
cessed output in order to enhance the reader&apos;s understanding (pp. 212-221). However,
most of the treatment of CLAWS is based on material written by the Lancaster team
between 1987 and 1994; the latest version of CLAWS, using the C7 tag set (as detailed
by Garside, Leech, and McEnery 1997), is not included in the book. To be fair, a piece
of linguistic software such as CLAWS is continually developed, and it would be hard
to keep pace with its latest release. Nowadays, a central means of resolving such prob-
lems is to get the reader into the practice of using the World Wide Web for updates of
the latest technological developments. Therefore, by the same token, Kennedy&apos;s docu-
mentation of the ENGCG Parser of English (which is software for word-class tagging
and syntactic parsing; see pp. 241-243) could be improved upon by providing the
relevant hypertextual links. The reader should know that analysis is available via e-
mail (engcg@lingsoft.fi), and the latest documentation and parsing demos are now on
the Web (http: II —tapanain/ cg/ index.html). Instead, throughout
the book, there are very few hyperlinks (which include, for instance, one link to the
British National Corpus on page 54 and another to the WordSmith Tools software on
page 267). Perhaps the evolving nature of the Internet and the World Wide Web means
that it would be less wise to provide Web links, which tend to get outdated after a
while, since computer technology will (without our vigilance) sooner or later tend to
outdate us all. But, then one can always look forward to the next book edition.
Kennedy&apos;s main focus is detailing the workings of language using the corpus-
based approach. Chapter 3, by far the longest, is devoted to an elucidation of various
linguistic investigations of the probabilistic nature of language. Language is rightly
seen as involving not only the Chomskyan set of possible or impossible structures
but (perhaps, more importantly) the set of probable or improbable structures. This
point concerning the nature of language is also made by no less a well-known linguist
than Michael Halliday (1992), who views lexicogrammar as an inherently probabilistic
system.
It is precisely the ability to interrogate or train the corpus for its relevant sta-
tistical probabilities that has allowed the emergence of natural language processing
systems that are more robust and successful in achieving language disambiguation.
This central fact has made the corpus so relevant to the practice of computational
linguistics nowadays. In his usual systematic manner, Kennedy traces the develop-
ments that have led to the much closer relationship between corpus linguistics and
computational linguistics (pp. 276-280).
An Introduction to Corpus Linguistics does not set out to be a book that details linguis-
tic programming for corpus analysis. Rather, the richness of the book is the author&apos;s
vast experience and knowledge in evaluating the development of corpora in linguistic
research; the book, in the author&apos;s own words, looks back &amp;quot;to the pre-electronic age
as well as to the massive growth of computer corpora in the electronic age.&amp;quot; A strong
feature of the book is the inclusion of many useful figures and tables that capture the

research findings in a concrete manner for the reader. This excellent book should be
required reading for students and teachers involved in corpus-based research and is
generally useful to anyone who seeks a more comprehensive understanding of the
resurgence of empirical linguistics.
