1. Overview
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997503">
The MIT Encyclopedia of the Cognitive Sciences (MITECS) brings together 471 brief articles
on a very wide range of topics within cognitive science. The general editors worked
with advisory editors in six contributing fields, including Gennaro Chierchia on Lin-
guistics and Language and Michael I. Jordan and Stuart Russell on Computational
Intelligence. MITECS opens with excellent overview articles by each of the advisory
editors on their fields.
The general quality of the contributors and their contributions is outstanding. The
editors secured the cooperation of leading scientists in every area including compu-
tational linguistics. Tables 1 and 2 suggest articles that are of particular interest in
computational linguistics. The division into sections is that of the book&apos;s companion
Web site;1 in the printed volume, the articles are arranged in a single alphabetical
sequence.
There are many other articles of immediate interest, including several on gram-
mar models popular in CL (Mark Steedman on Categorial Grammar, Georgia Green
on Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar, and Mary Dalrymple on Lexical Func-
tional Grammar) and several that treat computational simulations of psycholinguistic
phenomena. Dennis Norris&apos;s general article on computational psycholinguistics fo-
cuses nicely on interdisciplinary issues; it motivates why a range of computational
models remain interesting within cognitive science when language is the subject of
investigation.

cognitive science). Hector Levesque&apos;s article on Computational Complexity and Judea
Pearl&apos;s article on Bayesian Networks are notable exceptions: both consider the impli-
cations for cognitive science explicitly. It is easy to understand the editorial decision
to look to the major authorities on specific subjects and techniques rather than to
researchers who have emphasized application to issues of cognitive structure and
processing, but it reinforces the view of cognitive science as fragmented, perhaps im-
mature.

<bodyText confidence="0.999725727272727">
The CL articles may all be recommended. They will not serve professional computa-
tional linguists directly, but rather students in computational linguistics and colleagues
in allied fields who wish to get an idea of what CL is. One nonetheless gets the impres-
sion that CL fared suboptimally in the division of labor among the editors. To take
one obvious example, the articles on Computational Linguistics (by Aravind Joshi
in the section &amp;quot;Language and Linguistics&amp;quot;) and on Natural Language Processing (by
James Allen in the section &amp;quot;Computational Intelligence&amp;quot;) take little note of each other.
The article on CL mentions NLP as an alternative name for our field without, how-
ever, referring to the other article (in the fashion MITECS uses elsewhere). The NLP
article in turn discusses Machine Translation with no reference to the full article by
Hovy.

If computational linguistics focuses on language from a computational perspec-
tive (my favorite brief definition), then we might expect the Chomsky hierarchy of
languages and automata, together with their processing properties, to figure somehow
centrally, but this topic falls through the cracks. Arbib&apos;s article is extremely general, for
example explaining finite automata and regular languages (&amp;quot;finite-state languages&amp;quot;)
only as control mechanisms for Turing machines. The applicability of finite automata
to phonology and morphology gets no mention. Stabler&apos;s article on formal grammars
is interesting, but focuses on very general questions about the relation between human
language and formal models, in particular about the sorts of idealizations common in
work on formal language theory inspired by human language.
MITECS naturally reflects the impact that CL has on its scholarly neighbors in
cognitive science. It is gratifying to see CL acknowledged on the one hand in articles
on computation, for example in Bernhard Nebel&apos;s piece on Frame-Based Systems, and
on the other hand in articles on language, for example in Craige Roberts&apos;s article on
Discourse. Such references suggest cross-pollination of the sort that interdisciplinary
activity is meant to promote.
If MITECS may be taken as a reliable guide, however, then CL has limited impact
on cognitive science. Paul Gorrell&apos;s article on Sentence Processing might be expected
to attend to some of the work done on parsing in computational linguistics, but does
not. He mentions the Marcus parser and psycholinguistic work by Steedman in the
(miscited) volume edited by Dowty, Karttunen and Zwicky (1985), but ignores a com-
putational contribution there by Pereira (1985). There is no mention of incremental
processing, which Steedman (1990), Joshi (1990), Pereira and Pollack (1991), Shieber
and Johnson (1993), Nerbonne (1996), and others have written on. Tanenhaus and
Sedivy&apos;s article on ambiguity might be expected to teem with references to the disam-
biguation problem that has arguably been a major focus of CL over the past 20 years.
The article acknowledges only that ambiguity is a &amp;quot;central problem&amp;quot; in CL and is con-
tent to refer only to Allen (1995). There is no reason to doubt Gorrell&apos;s or Tanenhaus
and Sedivy&apos;s scholarship; rather, it suggests rather that CL work has little influence
on cognitive science of this sort.
Several articles report on psycholinguistic simulations that are taken to embody
hypotheses about human processing—for example, Norris&apos;s article (mentioned above),
and the two articles by Anne Cutler. These suggest points at which computational
linguists might profitably play a more active role. Computational models already exist
that account for human behavior with respect to recognition time, error as a function
of word frequency and similarity, and several other parameters that normally play no
role in core CL. These additional parameters might serve as interesting data from a
purely computational view. This sort of work is reported on by Dijkstra and de Smedt
(1996), but is not found (much) at ACL or similar conferences. MITECS suggests that
it is an interesting path to pursue further. It includes a nice pair of papers by Rick
Lewis and James McClelland on more general issues of symbolic versus connectionist
cognitive modeling.

Culture, cognition, and evolution is not a topic normally included in introduc-
tory texts on cognitive science, but may provide a fruitful perspective from which
to examine the current emphasis on &amp;quot;empiricist&amp;quot; methods in CL. The emphasis on
general data analysis techniques (as opposed to specifically linguistic methods) in
data-intensive CL may find its psychological counterpart in the emphasis on the rich
culture within which verbal activity is learned. Whether or not that seems plausible,
Stephen Levinson&apos;s article on Language and Culture is a useful modern perspective
on the issue of how culture, cognition, and language might be seen to interrelate.

5. Recommendation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999455">
Naturally, there are variations in style and quality in the articles, but on the whole they
are very good. More importantly for some purposes, the level at which the articles are
written is a bit uneven. Most articles will be accessible to advanced undergraduates in
any of the federated fields, but certainly not the articles on Bayesian Learning, Control
Theory, Statistical Learning Theory, Unsupervised Learning, and several others, all of
which rely on terse mathematical presentations.
The book is technically adequate: it is surprisingly sober, including relatively few
diagrams, charts, tables, or photos. An interesting article on Meter in Poetry by Jay
Keyser is marred by poor typesetting. Invaluable on the other hand, are the bibliogra-
phies at the ends of the articles. These appear to have enjoyed special attention, and
include very recent and, in general, very useful material. Only very occasionally do
we find contributors lapsing into references to &amp;quot;(unpublished)&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;(ms.)&amp;quot;, or the like.
MITECS is to be recommended to all libraries and to researchers in computa-
tional linguistics interested in cognitive science, especially those interested in how the
fields of linguistics, computation, and psychology might cooperate more effectively in
understanding language.

Paul Gorrell&apos;s article on Sentence Processing might be expected to attend to some of the work done on parsing in computational linguistics, but does not. He mentions the Marcus parser and psycholinguistic work by Steedman in the (miscited) volume edited by Dowty, Karttunen and Zwicky (1985), but ignores a computational contribution there by Pereira (1985). There is no mention of incremental processing, which Steedman (1990), Joshi (1990), Pereira and Pollack (1991), Shieber and Johnson (1993), Nerbonne (1996), and others have written on.

The article acknowledges only that ambiguity is a &amp;quot;central problem&amp;quot; in CL and is content to refer only to Allen (1995). There is no reason to doubt Gorrell&apos;s or Tanenhaus and Sedivy&apos;s scholarship; rather, it suggests rather that CL work has little influence on cognitive science of this sort.
