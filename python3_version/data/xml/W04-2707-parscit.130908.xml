We present the annotation of information
structure in the MULI project. To learn
more about the information structuring means
in prosody, syntax and discourse, theory-
independent features were defined for each
level. We describe the features and illustrate
them on an example sentence. To investigate
the interplay of features, the representation
has to allow for inspecting all three layers at
the same time. This is realised by a stand-off
XML mark-up with the word as the basic unit.
The theory-neutral XML stand-off annotation
allows integrating this resource with other lin-
guistic resources such as the Tiger Treebank
for German or the Penn treebank for English.

This paper reports on the project MULI (MUl-
tiLingual Information structure), a pilot study
in corpus annotation for the purpose of empir-
ically investigating the distribution of informa-
tion in texts. As the annotation happened on
an empirical basis, it was restricted to a small
scale, since the experimental design of the study
required testing of tools as well as manual anno-
tation. In a broader picture, we were especially
interested in contrasting the annotation schemes
as well as our findings for English and German,
as the name of the project indicates. MULI is
a step to enhance existing linguistically inter-
preted language resources like the Tiger Tree-
bank for German or the Penn Treebank for En-
glish with information on the interface between
prosody, syntax and (discourse) semantics. The
multilingual design of the study allows us to
identify language-specific realisations and pref-
erences of indicators of information structure.
The initial interest was to look into the corre-
lations and co-occurences of features on different
linguistic levels that can be interpreted as indi-
cators of information structure.
This resulted in a design of the annotation
scheme which was as theory independent as pos-
sible. We refrained from annotating abstract
categories of information structure like topic -
focus or theme - rheme and concentrated on
more concrete linguistic phenomena that have
been described as indicators of these abstract
categories on the different levels (cf. §2).
The challenge is to design, carry out and
maintain a corpus annotation to facilitate inter-
pretations of information distribution. Partic-
ularly, the different types of linguistic informa-
tion that are relevant for the analysis of informa-
tion distribution need to be combined in one re-
source, where the relevant types are drawn from
different linguistic levels. The goal in a multi-
layer annotation task like this is to keep each
layer of annotation intact, while at the same
time enabling relating the different layers when
analysing the corpus (e.g., in querying) (cf. §3).
In this paper we focus on the description of
the annotation scheme and the technical real-
ization of alignment of annotation layers. §2
describes the annotation scheme, discussing an
example from the corpus. §3 describes the tools
we used for the annotation at each layer and
presents our approach to relating the different
layers. §4 concludes with open challenges.

The MULI corpus comprisess app. 7.000 words
in 320 sentences extracted from the English
Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1994) and app.
3.500 words in 250 sentences from the German
Tiger Treebank (Brants et al., to appear). As
the Penn Treebank consists of newspaper texts
from the Wall Street Journal, we selected the
German sub-corpus from the economics section
of the newspaper Frankfurter Rundschau (which
makes up the Tiger Corpus) to make the con-
trastive sub-corpora as comparable as possible.
The use of existing syntactically annotated cor-
pora enabled us to concentrate on those phe-
nomena that are specific to information struc-
ture. The thus achieved annotation gives a com-
prehensive view on prosodic, syntactic and se-
mantic characteristics of the corpus.
In the following, we discuss the annotation of
prosody (§2.1), syntax (§2.2) and discourse se-
mantics (§2.3) and illustrate the annotation on
a sequence from the German corpus. The ex-
ample, given in Figure 1, was chosen because it
contains three subsequent sentences annotated
with fronting on the level of syntax. This cate-
gory was by far the most frequent in the German
syntax annotation and therefore was deemed a
suitable starting point for interpreting the inte-
gration of the three levels (§2.4).

2.1 Prosodic level
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998097866666667">
In spoken language, prosody (intonation, phras-
ing, stress, rhythm) is often used to realize in-
formation structure, e.g. the pragmatic struc-
ture (focus/background) or the degree of cog-
nitive activation of individual discourse refer-
ents (given/new). Accent placement and phras-
ing are the primary means to mark information
structural concepts, but pitch range, rhythm,
and speech rate also play an important role.
In order to carry out the prosodic annota-
tion, we recorded a German native speaker read-
ing aloud the German texts of the MULI cor-
pus.&apos; These recordings were digitised and an-

notated on six different levels: (1) word bound-
aries and pauses, (2) punctuation of the writ-
ten texts (which are not realised in the spo-
ken version), (3) position and type of pitch ac-
cents, force accents and boundary tones, (4) po-
sition and strength of phrase breaks, (5) rhyth-
mic phenomena, including non-canonical word
stress placement, and (6) comments.
The annotation of level 3 and 4 follows
the conventions of GToBI (German Tones
and Break Indices), which can be regarded
as standard for describing German intonation
within the framework of autosegmental-metrical
phonology (Grice et al., to appear).

Below we discuss, the prosodic annotation for
the German example sentences.
Phrasing Though the &amp;quot;Exporte&amp;quot; sentence is
realised as one intonational phrase, we can still
divide it into two parts. The first part, ending
after Libanon, marks the theme of the sentence
by a rising intonation contour on the focussed
constituent (Libanon). The second part marks
the rheme by a falling intonation on the focussed
constituent (kurzfristig). The overall contour is
called &apos;hat pattern&apos;, common for regular theme-
rheme sentences in German read speech.
Accent Placement, Accent Type The two
most prominent accents in the sentence are on
Libanon and kurzfristig, marking the end of
theme and rheme, respectively. There is another
accent on the word Exporte, however. At first
&amp;quot;Dem stehen, wie libanesische Gesprachspartner beklagten, beschrankte Ausfuhrgarantien entgegen.&amp;quot;
(This-DATIVE opposes, as Lebanese interlocutors deplore, limited export-guarantees PARTICLE.)
&amp;quot;Exporte in den Libanon sichert Bonn derzeit nur kurzfristig ab.&amp;quot;
(Exports in the Lebanon safeguards Bonn presently only short-term PARTICLE.)
&amp;quot;Bei aussichtsreichen mittel- und langfristigen Vorhaben versprach Rexrodt nun eine Einzelfallpriifung.&amp;quot;
(For promising medium- and long-term projects promised Rerrodt now an individual-case-examination.)

sight, the accent does not seem to be necessary,
neither for information structural nor rhythmic
reasons. Nevertheless, this weaker accent is ap-
propriate for marking a referent that is infer-
able from the preceding discourse. In this case,
Exporte is accessible via a bridging inference
from the term Ausfuhrgarantien mentioned in
the sentence before (cf. §2.3).
The most important information in the sen-
tence is provided by the word kurzfristig, since
it represents the only new part. Furthermore,
it is preceded by the focus particle nun under-
lining its informativeness. However, the word
kurzfristig does not receive a peak accent (H*),
which is the default marker of new or newswor-
thy information. It is instead marked by an
H+L* pitch accent. (Kohler, 1991) describes
this contour as typical for the end of an argu-
mentation or elaboration on something already
known. This nuclear contour (H+L* L-%) is
also common for marking the end of a para-
graph. This can be seen in the third sentence, in
which the H+L* accent is assigned to the para-
graph final word Einzelfallpriifung, although the
referent is brand-new in the discourse.

2.2 Syntactic level
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999961787234042">
On the syntactic level, the annotation concen-
trated on those structures which are relevant for
the information structure. These include struc-
tures deviating from the canonical word order
such as extraposition as well as those structures
which serve to focus on certain elements such as
clefting and voice, as far as the features were not
already explicitly annotated in the treebanks.
The syntactic annotation scheme builds on de-
scriptions of the analysed features in (Eisenberg,
1994) and (Weinrich, 1993) for German and in
(Quirk et al., 1985) and (Biber et al., 1999)
for English. It comprises cleft, pseudo-cleft, re-
versed pseudo-cleft, extraposition, fronting, ex-
pletive es for German and there-insertion for En-
glish, as well as active, medio-passive and pas-
sive. The unit under investigation on the syn-
tactic level is the clause, i.e. prior to the analysis
the corpus was segmented into clauses.
We annotated fronting, the feature found in
all three sentences in the sample sequence, when
an element of the clause structure which typ-
ically follows the finite verb is moved to the
clause initial position. For German the flexible
word order necessitates identifying the element
according to its status in the canonical sequence
of arguments rather than specifying the element
in question according to its respective syntactic
function. In clauses annotated with the feature
fronting another than the most inherent argu-
ment precedes the finite verb.
The three sentences of the sample sequence
were segmented into four clauses. The sec-
ond clause beginning with wie libanesische
Gesprchspartner is not marked with respect to
information structure. The fronted elements
in the other three clauses are the indirect ob-
ject realised by the anaphoric pronoun Dem in
the first sentence, the direct object Exporte in
den Libanon in the second sentence and the
circumstantial Bei aussichtsreichen mittel- ?Ind
langfristigen Vorhaben in the third sentence. All
four clauses in the three sentences are annotated
in active voice. However, the relevance of voice
for realising information structure has to be seen
with precaution, since this feature has also other
functions such as underspecifying the agent. 2

2.3 Discourse level
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.990522372093023">
At the level of discourse semantics we con-
centrated on linguistic expressions introduc-
ing or accessing discourse entities, annotating
them with their referential properties and the
anaphoric links between them. Below we briefly
motivate the choice of referential properties.
Information structure theories describe the
phenomena at hand at a surface level, at a
semantic level at both levels simultaneously,
i.e., an expression belongs to some IS partition,
in virtue of some the information-status of
the corresponding discourse entity For the
investigation of IS at the semantic level, we
need more information about the character
of the discourse entities introduced by lin-
guistic expressions. We annotated: Type
(intensional or extensional object,
property, eventuality or textuality)
and more finegrained Semantic Sort; refer-
ential properties of Delimitation (unique,
existential, variable, non-denotational
use (Hlavsa, 1975)) and Quantification
(uncountable, unspecific non-singular,
specific-nonsingular or specific
singular); Information Status (new,
unused, inferable, evoked (Prince, 1981))
and Form -because there are correlations
with the other features, though it does not
necessarily belong to this level.
Besides the properties of individual dis-
course referents, we annotate anaphoric
links. We distinguish between coreference
and bridging anaphoric links. The for-
mer is identity of reference, the latter in-
volves an associative relationship between the
anaphor and the the antecedent, such as set
containment, part-whole composition,
property attribution, generalized
appurtenance, causality or lexical
argument filling.
In line with the recommendations of the Text
Encoding Initiative3 and the Discourse Resource
Initiative4, we define what expressions are mark-

ables, what properties they have as attributes
and what links can hold among them. Our anno-
tation scheme and guidelines build on MUC-75
Coreference Specification, DRAMA (Passoneau,
1996), the MATE project6 and (Muller and
Strube, 2001).
In the example sequence, we find instances of
both (i) coreference (dem und Rextrodt -both
have unique, textually evoked referents) and (ii)
bridging (libanesische Gespriichspartner has a
unique referent of inferrable status (general ap-
purtenance to the business trip of minister Rex-
trodt); Bonn has a unique referent (the German
government) of inferrable status, being the su-
perset containing also the minister; Exporte in
den Libanon has a referent of the variable type
( &amp;quot;any&amp;quot;) which has inferrable status given its at-
tribute, the export guarranties mentioned in the
preceding sentence; aussichtsreichen mittel- ?Ind
langfristigen Vorhaben has again a variable ref-
erent of inferrable status ( general appurtenance
to exports). beschriikte Ausfuhrgarantien and
eine Einzelfallprillung have referents of existen-
tial type of brand new status. All these referents
are of extensional type.

2.4 Integrated view on the annotation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999346555555556">
To see whether the syntactic markedness is
matched by distinctive features on the other lev-
els under investigation, we look in more detail
at the second sentence. The fronted direct ob-
ject Exporte in den Libanon establishes a the-
matic relationship to the immediately preceding
element in the previous sentence. Semantically,
Exporte is linked by a bridging relation of the
type attribution to Ausfuhrgarantien in the
NP beschriinkte Ausfuhrgarantien. This way the
preceding rheme beschrankte Ausfuhrgarantien
is thematised. The accent on Exporte inter-
preted as pointing to an inferable referent in
(§2.1) substantiates this anaphoric link. In the
third sentence this theme is further specified
by langfristige Vorhaben in thematic position,
which is related to it by a bridging relation of
the type general appurtenance.

In the &amp;quot;Exporte&amp;quot; sentence the subject Bonn
follows the finite verb. The position in the Mit-
telfeld, syntactically the least focussed position
in the sentence, already suggests its unfocussed
character. The findings on the level of prosody
corroborate this assumption. Another accent
might have been expected on Bonn, since in read
speech normally every NP receives one. Here,
however, it has obviously been regarded as being
too &apos;given&apos; to &apos;deserve&apos; intonational prominence.
Indeed the agent does not contribute much infor-
mation to the message. Were the sentence pas-
sive, the syntactic structure would remain the
same and the loss of additional information ex-
pressed by the agent would be minimal. The
object in fronted position realises a link to the
immediately preceding discourse entity and thus
serves to make the present sequence coherent. In
canonical word order with the subject in initial
position the passage would lose its focus on the
subject matter of exports.
The circumstantial kurzfristig again realises
an anaphoric link to the rhematised subject of
the previous sentence. It specifies the limitation
of the export guarantees and is emphasised lex-
ically by the focus particle nun As explained
in (§2.1) against all expectation kurzfristig does
not receive a peak accent. The combination of
the levels reveals that the sentence as a whole is
an elaboration of the preceding rheme.
When looking at the prosody of the example,
we obtain yet another view on the information
structure. As seen in (§2.1) the fronted element
does not receive a marked accent but rather the
phrasing typical for an unmarked theme. Thus,
from the point of view of prosody, the specific
pattern of fronting is not discernable.7
With respect to the following sentence the cir-
cumstantial kurzfristig implies a link to the pre-
modifier mittel- und langfristig which together
form some kind of a member-set relationship.
The example shows that rather than the fea-
tures on the different levels all concentrating on

on the level of syntax is correlated with the realisation of
an intermediate phrase in combination with rising accent
on the prosodic level. But as this is a typical property of
initial accents it has only limited explanatory power.
certain elements in the sentence, the specificities
on each level spread over different elements in
the text. Level-specific annotation thus forms a
complex picture giving comprehensive evidence
on how the information is structured in the text.
This division of work between the levels requires
an integrated view on information structure that
is best represented in a stand-off annotation.

3 Technical realisation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999911829268293">
In the previous sections we presented a multi-
layered view of information structure, where
each layer is to be annotated independently,
in order to allow us to investigate interactions
across the layers. Such investigations involve ei-
ther exploration of the integrated data (i.e., si-
multaneous viewing of the different levels and
searching across levels) or integrated process-
ing, e.g., in order to discover correlations across
layers. There are two crucial technical require-
ments that must be satisfied to make this possi-
ble: (i) stand-off annotation at each layer and
(ii) alignment of base data across the layers.
Without the first, we would not be able to keep
the layers separate, without the latter we would
not be able to align the separate layers.
There are currently basically two kinds of
approaches dealing with multi-layer corpus an-
notation: one is committed to a hierarchical
data structure either implemented as rela-
tional databases (e.g., EMU (Cassidy and Har-
rington, 2001)) or in XML (e.g., XCES (Ide
et al., 2000) or MATE (McKelvie et al., 2001))
using XPointers or ordered directed acyclic
graphs (ODAGs) to represent intersecting hi-
erarchies. The other is based on the concept
of temporality using directed arcs representing
nodes at certain time offsets on a given time-
line this concept is reflected in the annotation
graph (AG) as proposed by (Bird and Liberman,
2001).
Our approach to multi-layer annotation is
based on both of these concepts (see also (Teich
et al., 2001)): from AGs we adopt the principle
of modularity, i.e., we keep independent layers of
annotation separate, even if they can in principle
be merged into a single hierarchy. From ODAGs
we adopt the possibility to explicitly represent
structural hierarchies if they are meaningful.
Like in MATE, we have chosen XML as the con-
crete data format to maintain and represent an-
notations, in order to take advantage of the rich
set of readily available tools to edit, validate,
transform, and query XML. This means the fol-
lowing for our stand-off annotation: The raw
text of the corpus is represented as a flat text
file each token carrying a unique ID. Each
layer of annotation is represented as a separate
XML file. Each markable containing the linguis-
tic information is equipped with the ID or the
IDs of the corresponding text sequence. Parallel
aligned texts (e.g. spoken and written versions
of the corpus) are also represented via shared
IDs in order to refer to overlapping segments.
A related issue is that of annotation tools.
One possibility would be to use a generic tool
supporting the annotation of either of the lev-
els we are concerned with (and any levels that
we may want to add in the future). The
most ambitious projects we are familiar with
are the MATE Workbench8 and the follow-up
NITE Workbench9 for multi-level, cross-level
and cross-modality annotation of language data.
The MATE Workbench has been developed as a
highly customizable tool for parallel annotation
of arbitrary and possibly non-hierarchical layers
of linguistic description. It is an open source
tool written in Java and handles XML-encoded
data. Unfortunately, practical experiences out-
side the MATE project itself have been rather
negative (e.g., (Muller and Strube, 2001)). The
NITE Workbench has equally ambitious goals,
however, the available prototype version is im-
plemented in C++ and only for Windows.
It is quite likely that any tool aimed at being
entirely generic will run into problems of effi-
ciency for (most of) the individual layers, be-
cause of too much additional processing over-
head. Therefore, we prefer to use tools specif-
ically designed to support the particular anno-
tation task(s) at hand. We describe the tools of
our choice below.

Prosodic Level Two people annotated the
spoken data with the EMU Speech Database
System1-9 ((Cassidy and Harrington, 2001)) fol-
lowing our annotation scheme (§2.1). For each
of the six annotation levels, EMU produces a file
in which time stamps are associated with the re-
spective annotated label.&amp;quot; The EMU files have
to be converted into stand-off XML. To be able
to align the prosodic annotation with the syn-
tax and the discourse level, we chose the word
as common basic unit. The prosodic annotation
itself can be organised in a strictly hierarchical
fashion: Each intonation phrase (IP) carries one
boundary tone and consists of one or more inter-
mediate phrases. Each intermediate phrase (ip)
carries one boundary tone and consists of one or
more words. Each word can be associated with
one or more (pitch or force) accents.
The word as basic unit poses several problems
for the prosodic level, though. First, punctua-
tion marks count as separate words, but are not
realised in spoken language. To be able to corre-
late prosodic phrasing and punctuation marks,
we store the punctuation marks as attributes of
the respective preceding word. Second, pauses
occur very often in speech, but as they are not
part of the written texts, they do not count as
words. Because they are an important feature
for phrasing and rhythm, we also code them as
attributes of the preceding word. Third, in some
cases a single word carries more than one accent,
e.g. long compounds ( Getriinkedosenhersteller),
or numbers. In these cases, it would be interest-
ing to know which part(s) of the word get ac-
cented. Finally, for some multi-word units, e.g.
18,50 Mark, the spoken realisation (achtzehn
Mark fiinfzig) cannot be aligned with the ortho-
graphic form, because spoken and orthographic
form differ in number and order of words.
Syntactic Level For the syntactic annota-
tion, we used the XML editor XML-Spy12. The
annotation scheme is defined in a DTD (see be-
low), which is used to check the well-formedness
and the validity of the annotation.

Discourse Level Two people annotated the
MULI corpus for the discourse annotation; (one
of the developers of the annotation scheme and
one annotator who was only instructed by the
annotation guidelines), using the MMAX an-
notation tool developed at EML, Heidelberg
(Muller and Strube, 2003). MMAX is a light-
weight tool written in Java rhat runs under both
Windows and Unix/Linux. It supports multi-
level annotation of XML-encoded data using an-
notation schemes defined as DTDs. MMAX im-
plements the above-mentioned general concepts
of markables with attributes and standing in link
relations to one another. To exploite and reuse
annotated data in the MMAX format, there is
the MMAX Discourse API.
Integration Of course, the tools output dif-
ferent data formats: on the prosodic level in the
EMU data format, on the syntactic level in Tiger
XML and on the discourse level in MMAX XML
format. Hence it is necessary to either convert
these &amp;quot;native&amp;quot; representations into a single data
format that can be processed by one common
tool, or implement an interface for each format
that can retrieve the relevant information. Ini-
tial steps in both directions have been made by
implementing a Java API using Tiger XML as
its common data format.
Figures 3-6 show how the raw text of the sam-
ple is encoded and how the annotation spans of
each annotated markable refer to the IDs of the
raw text in the example. The annotation lev-
els (prosody, syntax, disourse) are kept separate.
The time spans of the prosodic annotation are
aligned with base words.

The challenge in the MULI project is to define
theory-neutral and language-independent anno-
tation schemes for annotating linguistic data
with information that pertains to the realisa-
tion and interpretation of information structure
((Skut et al., 1997) is methodologically related).
An important characteristic of the MULI cor-
pus, arising from its theory-neutrality, is that
it is descriptive. The corpus annotation is not
based on explanatory mechanisms. We need to
derive such explanations from the data.
An important strand of research that the
MULI corpus facilitates is the linguistic investi-
gation of how phenomena at different annotation
layers interact. For example, how do syntactic
structure and intonation interact to realize in-
formation structure? Or, how does information
structure interact with anaphoric relationships?
In this way, linguistic investigations can help to
extend existing accounts of information struc-
ture, and can also be used to verify (or falsify)
predictions made by such accounts.
Also, the corpus makes it possible to construct
computational models from the corpus data. For
example, we can consider the integration of in-
formation structure into approaches to gram-
mar learning to provide a bridge between sur-
face phenomena and deeper levels of meaning.
Another challenge would be the construction of
lexicalized models of salience tracking, useful to
determine e.g. the appropriate answer context

in Q&amp;A-systems. Furthermore, we can use the
data to construct shallow parsers for information
structure and discourse structure, possibly using
co-training or active learning given the relatively
small amount of data we are working with.
Theory-neutrality not only raises interesting
challenges when for building explanatory mod-
els based on the data. It also facilitates the in-
tegration with other, theory-neutral resources.
To some extent we have already explored this
in MULI, combining e.g. Tiger annotation with
discourse-level annotation. Another possibility
to explore is the to integrate MULI annota-
tion with, e.g., the SALSA corpus (Erk et al.,
2003), which provides more detailed semantico-
pragmatic information in the style of FrameNet.

<abstract confidence="0.9723449375">We present the annotation of information structure in the MULI project. To learn more about the information structuring means in prosody, syntax and discourse, theoryindependent features were defined for each level. We describe the features and illustrate them on an example sentence. To investigate the interplay of features, the representation has to allow for inspecting all three layers at the same time. This is realised by a stand-off XML mark-up with the word as the basic unit. The theory-neutral XML stand-off annotation allows integrating this resource with other linguistic resources such as the Tiger Treebank for German or the Penn treebank for English.</abstract>
