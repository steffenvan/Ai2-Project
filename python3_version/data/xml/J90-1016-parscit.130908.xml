ACL MEMBERSHIP DIRECTORY Planned; Please Provide Complete Phone &amp; Email Information
Membership in the Association for Computational Linguistics is for the calendar year, regardless of when dues are paid. Membership
includes a full year of the ACL journal Computational Linguistics, reduced registration at most ACL-sponsored conferences, and
discounts on ACL-sponsored publications. A late payment fee will be charged for renewals made after 15 March; this fee does
not apply to new members. Institutions now subscribe to the journal through MIT Press Journals, 55 Hayward Street, Cambridge, MA
02142 USA; (+1-617)253-2889. Back issues and proceedings are available only from the ACL Office, except that institutions should
backorder journals from 1988 on through MIT Press. An order form is on the other side of this statement. Dues and back order
payments can be made in Europe and Japan as well as the U.S.; most Europeans should pay through Europe; read the directions
under the heading PAYMENT below carefully. Identify your institutional affiliation if it is not part of your address. Also provide
your telephone country &amp; city codes and your computer network &amp; email address.

The ACL set up a fund in 1982 to make ACL memberships and publications available to colleagues who have difficulty in using their
national currencies for international transactions or for whom membership would otherwise be impossible. Contributions may be
tax-deductible in the United States and in some other countries; check local regulations.
PAYMENT: Prepayment is necessary; invoices are available on request. Checks should be made out to the Association for
Computational Linguistics (or to ACL). Payments can be made to one of the addresses below, as follows:

Guidelines for Submissions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99944725">
Manuscripts to Computational Linguistics should be submitted on letter-size paper (8.5 by 11 inches, or
A4), double-spaced throughout, including footnotes and references. The paper should begin with an
informative abstract of approximately 150-250 words. Manuscripts must be written in English. Contact
the editor regarding the possibility of electronic submission.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.707535">
Submissions may be made in any of the following categories:
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.887168657894737">
PAPER: This category includes contributions that report significant new research results in computational
linguistics or that provide critical reviews of the literature on a particular topic. The length of a paper
depends on its content, but we suggest that manuscripts be limited to forty double-spaced pages. That is
the equivalent of twelve journal pages. Each paper is fully refereed, being read by at least two members of
the editorial board and usually by an additional expert in the particular subject matter.
The submission of an article to CL for refereeing means that the author certifies the manuscript is not
copyrighted; nor has it been published or submitted for publication to another refereed journal. If any
version of the paper has appeared, or will appear, in a non-refereed publication, the details of such
publication must be made known to the Editor at the time of submission. The final version of a paper
tentatively accepted for publication must be accompanied by a Copyright Transfer Agreement signed by
all of the authors or, in the case of a &amp;quot;work for hire,&amp;quot; by the employer. This written transfer is necessary
under the 1978 U.S. Copyright law.
TECHNICAL CORRESPONDENCE: This category includes short articles reporting preliminary results
of some project in progress, or the results of other studies of interest to the readership. Technical
correspondences should not generally exceed eight double-spaced pages. Each technical correspondence is
reviewed by at least two members of the editorial board before acceptance.
LETTERS TO THE EDITOR: This includes statements of opinion on issues relevant to the readership.
The Editor and the editorial board will evaluate the appropriateness of these contributions for inclusion.
Five copies of papers, technical correspondences, and letters should be sent to the Editor:
James F. Allen, CL Editor
Department of Computer Science
University of Rochester
Rochester, NY 14627, USA
INTERNET:acl@cssochester.edu
Anyone interested in reviewing a book, or in suggesting a book for review, should contact the Book Review
Editor; publishers may also submit copies of books for review directly to the Book Review Editor:
Graeme Hirst, CL Book Review Editor
Department of Computer Science
University of Toronto
Toronto, CANADA M5S 1A4
INTERNET:gh@ai.toronto.edu
The FINITE STRING Editor should receive (a) copies of technical reports and reprints of papers
published elsewhere—or at least citation information and abstracts of such items and of books and
monographs; (b) summaries of research in progress—of particular interest would be perspectives on the
activities at a particular institution; (c) announcements of meetings of potential interest to the
membership; and (d) personal notes (e.g., honors, moving, changes in status). Time-sensitive material
should be received by the first day of the second month of each quarter to appear in the next issue.
Submissions (where possible in electronic form) should be sent to The FINITE STRING Editor:
