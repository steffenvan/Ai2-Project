ABSTRACT

<bodyText confidence="0.99995847368421">
Computer synthesized speech is and will con-
tinue to be an important feature of many artifi-
cially intelligent systems. Although current
computer synthesized speech is intelligible, it
cannot yet pass a Turing test. One avenue for
improving the intelligibility of computer synthe-
sized speech and for making it more human-like is
to incorporate stress patterns on words. But to
achieve this improvement, a set of stress predic-
tion rules amenable to computer implementation is
needed.
This paper evaluates one such theory for pre-
dicting stress, that of Liberman and Prince. It
first gives an overview of the theory and then
discusses modifications which were necessary for
computer implementation. It then describes an
experiment which was performed to determine the
model&apos;s strengths and shortcomings. The paper con-
cludes with the results of that study.

I INTRODUCTION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.95906875">
Since speech is such an important component
of human activities, it is essential that it be
included in computer systems simulating human
behavior or performing human tasks. Advantages of
interacting with a computer system capable of
speech include that
a) special equipment (e.g. a terminal) is
unnecessary for receiving output from the
device.
b) the output may be communicated to several
people simultaneously.
c) it may be used to gain someone&apos;s atten-
tion.
d) it is useful in communicating information
in an emergency.

The primary methods for generating computer
synthesized speech are 1) to use a lexicon of word
pronunciations and then assemble a message from
these stored words or 2) to use a letter-co-sound
translator. A shortcoming common to both methods,
and of interest to linguists and more recently
computer scientists, is the inclusion of English
prosody in computer synthesized speech e.g. Klatt
[6], Lehiste (8], Witten eta]. [11] and Hill [5].
Of the three primary components of English
prosody, this paper considers only stress (the
other two are intonation and pause). It applies
the theory for stress prediction proposed by lin-
guists Mark Liberman and Alan Prince [9] to com-
puter synthesized speech. Their theory was chosen
primarily as a result of it having received wide-
spread attention since its introduction (see
Paradis (10], Yip [12], Fujimura (3 and 41 and
Basboll [2]).

II THE LIBERMAN-PRINCE MODEL
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999804964285714">
In addition to the attention it received, the
Liberman-Prince model (9] (hereafter referred to
as the LP model) is attractive for computer appli-
cation for two other reasons. First, the majority
of its rules can be applied without knowledge of
the lexical category (part-of-speech) of the word
being processed since the rules are based only on
the sequences and attributes of letters in a word.
This feature is especially important in an unre-
stricted text-to-speech translation system.
Secondly, since the metrical trees that define the
prominence relations are a common data structure,
a computer model may be designed which remains
very close to the foundations and intentions of
the theoretical model.
This section will summarize the LP theory as
presented in [9]. The LP method of predicting
stress focuses on two attributes of vowels: + or
- long and + or -low. The e of be is +long while
the e of pet is -long. Each of the vowels has
both a + and - long pronunciation. For example:
state, sat, pint, pin, snow, pot, cute, and cup.
The attribute + or - low is named for the height
of the tongue in the mouth during articulation of
the sound (see Figure 1). During production of a
+low vowel, the tongue is low in the mouth while
it is high for a -low vowel. Speaking aloud the
words in the figure demonstrates this difference.

Stress is not inherent to vowels in isolation
but is present only within words. Stress of a
vowel phoneme within a word is a relative quality
that is noticeable only by contrast with surround-
ing phonemes. Consonant phonemes may also be
defined in terms of several different attributes,
but within this theory their main purpose is to
combine with vowels to complete the syllable
structure of the words.
In English, each syllable of a word must con-
tain at least one vowel. A syllable can be a
single vowel, rode-o; it may be an open syllable
with the vowel at a syllable boundary, 22-lice,
ar-ticulate or it may be a closed syllable with
the vowel surrounded by consonants, Mon-tana. The
term &apos;vowel&apos; in this context means vowel phoneme
and not orthographic vowel; the same is true for
consonants. The th in thing is considered a sin-
gle consonant phoneme.
The LP model defines context sensitive rules
that can be used to predict which vowels within a
word should be stressed. The three rule types
are:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9941725">
1) English Stress Rule and the Stress Retrac-
tion Rule - ESR and SRA,
2) English Destressing Rule - EDR, and
3) Excepcionless Vowel Lengthening Rule - EVL.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999702630434783">
As the names imply, the first and second rules deal
with assignment of + or - stress, while the third
predicts which vowels should be 1921. All three
rules operate within a word from right to left.
In the first stage, the shape of the penulti-
mate (next-to-last) syllable determines the assign-
ment of the + stress attribute using the ESR rule.
&amp;quot;If the penultimate vowel is short and followed by
(at most) one consonant, then stress falls on the
preceding syllable,&amp;quot; [9] as in Table 1(a). &amp;quot;If
the penultimate vowel is long (Table 1(b)) or fol-
lowed by two or more consonants (Table 1(c)) then
it must bear stress itself.&amp;quot; (9] Each of the
previous statements assumes the final vowel is
short. The fourth case of the ESR says that if the
final vowel is long then it must bear stress.
Table 1(d). (See (9) for exceptions to this
first stage.)
In the second stage, the +stress attribute is
assigned based on the position of the leftmost
+stress vowel in the word. Since the rule
retracts stress across the word it is called the
Stress Retraction Rule (SRR).
The ESR and SRR mark certain vowels to be
stressed; this however does not imply that when
the word is spoken, each of the vowels will be
stressed. Thera are instances, depending on the
characteristics of the word, where vowels will
lose their stress through the application of the
English Destressing Rule (EDR).
The EDR depends on the notion of metrical
trees whose purpose it is to give an alternating
rhythm to the syllables of a word and define the
relative prominence of each syllable within the
word. Rhythm is reflected by the assignment of
the attribute s, strong, to stressed syllables and
w, weak, to unstressed syllables. For the words
labor, caprice, and Pamela the trees are simple
(see Figure 2). The first rule in building the
tree is if the vowel is -stress then its attribute
is w, if the vowel is +stress then it may be s or
w. The root node of any independent subtree or
the root node of the final tree is not labeled.
The s w labeling defines a contrast between two
adjacent components of a word; therefore, a soli-
tary s or w would have no meaning.
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.996067">
Figure 2. Assignment of s and w.
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.999850625">
Each time a +stress is assigned by either the
ESR or the SRA an attempt is made to add to the
tree. As in the word labor a node is added to the
tree and the vowels are marked s or w according to
their stress markings, + or -. Next, any
unattached vowels to the right of the new node are
added, as with Pamela. This builds a series of
binary subtrees that are necessarily left branching

The s, w assignment is made by the Lexical
Category Prominence Rule (LCPR). In its simplest
form it states: In the configuration [N1,N2]
within a lexical category, 142 is s if and only if
it branches. The LCPR has already been used in
the stress assignments of teleological, Pamela,
and execute, to connect unattached vowels to the
right of the + - sequences. The LCPR also follows
the convention that no -stress vowel is assigned

To insure that all vowels are included in the
tree, one final step is necessary as illustrated
by the word Monongahela. Following the rules as
previously outlined will generate a stress assign-
ment and tree such as that in Figure 6(a). The
first vowel must be included in the tree to pro-
duce Figure 6(b). This is done as the last stage
of tree building. The LCPR is used in this case
to join the vowel and the tree structure and to
assign s, w values.

The English Destressing Rule (EDR) is used to
determine which vowels should be reduced. Gener-
ally two things happen when a vowel is reduced.
First, it will lose its +stress attribute and
secondly, the vowel sound will be reduced to a
schwa (an indeterminate sound in many unstressed
syllables, e.g. the leading a in America). The
rule is based on the tree prominence relations of
the metrical trees, and is restricted to operating
on only those vowels that have been marked +stress
by either the ESR or SRR (see [9]).
Finally the Exceptionless Vowel Lengthening
Rule (see [91) is applied to handle apparent
exceptions in the operation of the ESR, e.g. words
such as alien, simultaneous, radium and labia
which contain a vowel sequence preceding the vowel
to be stressed.

III IMPLEMENTATION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999125722222222">
Converting a theoretical model such as that
proposed by LP into a computerized implementation
poses problems. One concern is whether the rules
and definitions of the theory are well suited to a
computer implementation, or if not, must they be
transformed to such an extent that they no longer
resemble the originals? Fortunately the LP theory
is expressed in rules and definitions that easily
lend themselves to an implementation.
Overcoming other problems while remaining
close to the LP theory involves a careful combina-
tion of three factors. First, certain modifica-
tions must be made with the application of the
rules for locating the +stress attribute and build-
ing metrical trees. Second, several assumptions
must be made about the exact definitions of the
terms such as VOWEL and CONSONANT. Third, some of
the rules which are too general must be restricted.
None of these modifications causes a drastic
reshaping of the model.
(see Figure 3). There are some situations where
nothing can be added to the tree after the assign-
ment of +stress. Such words cause a rephrasing of
the second step above to become: next attach any
vowels to the right of the present vowel that have
not been attached during the operation of a pre-
vious rule.
These two steps allow trees such as those in
Figure 4 to be formed. Two questions remain. How
is the tree completed? How are the s, w relations
defined above the vowel level?
To answer the first question; after all
unattached vowels to the right have been attached
into a left branching subtree, this subtree is
joined to the highest node of the subtree imme-
diately to the right, if it exists (see Figure 5).

Three outcomes exist for a word being pro-
cessed by such a system. One, the stress pattern
of the word will be correctly predicted. Two, the
stress pattern of the word will be incorrectly
predicted. Three, the word will drop through
without the system being able to predict any
stress. Any modifications, assumptions or
restrictions imposed should be done with the
primary intent of reducing the number of words for
which an incorrect stress pattern is predicted,
even if this means increasing the number of words
which drop through.
One modification was to use a phonetic trans-
lation of the word instead of its standard spell-
ing. This meant working from an underlying repre-
sentation rather than the surface representation.
By working from the underlying representation, the
attributes +-stress, and +-low could be differen-
tiated from the phonetic alphabet character
directly because a +long vowel and a -long, vowel
would be represented by two different characters
in the phonetic alphabet. Four immediate results
occur from making this modification. First, sin-
gle consonant sounds such as the th in thing are
represented by a single character. However, the
same is not true for dipthongs. Both IPA symbols
and VOTRAX codes (a VOTRAX ML-I speech synthesizer
was used to output the results of the stress pre-
diction) for dipthongs are multiple character
codes. Second, in a phonetic translation all
reduced vowels are already reduced. Therefore for
the most part the EDR is of little value. It only
retains its usefulness for initial syllables that
are not stressed but whose vowel is not schwa.
This syllable will draw stress by the SRR creating
a situation for the EDR to apply. Third, the ESR
and SRR also operate less freely because they will
not apply stress to a schwa. Fourth, a new rule
is required to operate in conjunction with the EVL.
This rule must give a final +long vowel, such as
the e in story, the -long attribute so that the
ESR can correctly assign stress.
A second change was that the SRR could be
applied in accordance with the principle of dis-
junctive ordering. This situation results from
the fact that a translator system has no lexicon.
Although the words therefore cannot be marked for
a particular type of stress retraction (SRI), it
does not cause a major problem.
One implication of these modifications is the
sequential ordering of the rules which group words
into classes based solely on the characteristics
of their phonetic translation. Therefore any set
of stress rules should be organized in terms of a
&apos;best fit&apos; mode of application. Secondly, the
stress rules cannot be defined in a way that can
differentiate syllable boundaries, so no rule can
be based on the concept of a &apos;light&apos; or &apos;heavy&apos;
syllable. Although the stress rule input form does
allow an affix option, it should be kept in mind
that the en of enforce is considered a prefix as
well as the en of English. Finally, there can be
no distinction between words based on the word
stem or the word origin, except, in the case of
word origin, if it can be defined in terms of a
distinct affix. For example the Greek prefix
hetero in: heterodox, heteronyn, or heterosexual
is a candidate for long retraction by the SRR.
Although the application model is a modified
version of the LP model, it still operates in the
manner of their original intent.

IV EVALUATION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997462625">
An experiment was conducted to evaluate
stress placement using the computerized version of
the LP model. A random sample of unique English
words and their correct phonetic translations used
for the experiment was selected from the American
Heritage Dictionary Cl]. Five hundred pairs of
random numbers were generated; the first number in
the pair was a random number between one and the
page number of the last page in the dictionary and
the second one was a random number between one and
sixty. For each pair, the first number was the
page on which the random word was to be found and
the second number, n, determined the word to be
the n&apos;th on the page. If n was larger than the
actual number of words on the page, then n modulo
the number of words on the page was used. If the
selected word was not polysyllabic, it was
rejected. Using this technique, 357 unique random
words were selected. Each word was translated
into ASCII codes for the VOTRAX according to the
phonetic translation in the dictionary. These
translations were then given as input to the
stress system.
Because the words in the random sample con-
tain combinations of primary, secondary, and
tertiary stress, several methods arise for evalu-
ating the results (listed in the order of impor-
tance):
1) The number of words completely correct,
the number of words incorrect, and the
number of words which dropped through.
2) The number of times primary, secondary,
and tertiary stress were each individually
predicted correctly regardless of the
other two.
3) The number of times when secondary or
tertiary stress was incorrectly predicted.
4) The number of times secondary or tertiary
stress was predicted but the word did not
require it.
5) The number of times secondary or tertiary
stress was needed but not predicted.
The figures for the first evaluation are shown
in Table 2. The totally correct words are slightly
under two thirds of the entire sample. However,
when the words with correct stress and the words
which fell through are combined, the total is
slightly over 707..

The results of the second evaluation are
shown in Table 3. While primary stress is pre-
dicted correctly in 75% of the cases, secondary
stress is only 53% and tertiary stress occurs too
infrequently to make any observations. The number
in parentheses in Table 3 indicates the total num-
ber of the particular stress level required.

The third evaluation results are shown in
Table 4. The 19% in which secondary stress was
placed on the wrong syllable is small but still
significant. Again tertiary stress occurrences
were too few to make observations.

words of Table 2. The importance of this fact
appears when one considers that the stress pattern
is partially correct, but is not distortec by
incorrect stressing. Therefore even though par-
tial, this stress pattern would be an improvement.
If these words are now combined with the totally
correct words and those which dropped through,
they equal 291 words or 81.51%, i.e. almost 82% of
the words can be stressed totally, partially, or
left unchanged.

With 63.3% of the sample words completely
correct, 73.10% of the sample words completely or
partially correct, 8.4% unmodified and 18.49% in
error, this test has demonstrated that the stress
model defined by the stress system and its input
rules does work in a substantial percentage of
cases.
Of the 66 words that were incorrectly
stressed, most fall into one of four categories.
1) Two syllable words where the vowel
pattern is -long -long or +long +1ong and
the last syllable is stressed. In these
cases the stress system incorrectly
assigns stress to the first vowel: e.g.,
transact, mistrust.

Finally the fifth evaluation leads to Table 6.
This table shows the number of times secondary or
tertiary stress was required but not predicted. An
interpretation of this table suggests that for 35
words which needed both primary and secondary
stress, only primary stress was predicted. These
words are also included in the incorrectly stressed
3) When in a two syllable word, the word
stem vowel is short and the prefix or
suffix vowel is long, the long vowel is
marked for stress, e.g. fancied.
4) The LCPR does not correctly assign nodes
s, w, values, e.g. contumacy, gastight.
Each of these groups is an exception to a larger
group whose stress patterns fit the predicted
patterns.
A final question is: How well does this
system predict stress in the most common English
words? Of the 200 most common, 162 have a single
vowel in their phonetic translation and therefore
would drop through the system without being modi-
fied. Of the 38 remaining words, 33 are correctly
stressed by the stress system, leaving 5 incor-
rectly stressed. However, since these are the
most common of words of English, it would seem
reasonable to include these words as special rules

V SUMMARY
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999927208333333">
Computer synthesized speech and linguistic
theories for predicting stress can interact with
one another to mutual benefit. Computer synthe-
sized speech techniques can be used to evaluate
the linguistic theory. Just as computers have
been used so often to evaluate theories in other
disciplines, so too can they be used in linguis-
tics. The organization, speed, accuracy and
unbiasedness of the computer makes it superior
to a person in many respects for judging a
hypothesis.
On the other hand, the linguistic theories
can provide a substantial base on which to build
language components of artificially intelligent
systems. The intelligibility of computer syn-
thesized speech can be improved with the applica-
tion of linguistic theories for predicting stress
such as that proposed by Liberman and Prince.
Evaluations such as that presented in this
paper will be of value not only in comparing com-
peting theories but will also be helpful in deter-
mining whether the accuracy of a theory&apos;s predic-
tions is acceptable for a particular application
and where improvements may be made to the theory.

<abstract confidence="0.9948497">Computer synthesized speech is and will continue to be an important feature of many artificially intelligent systems. Although current computer synthesized speech is intelligible, it cannot yet pass a Turing test. One avenue for improving the intelligibility of computer synthesized speech and for making it more human-like is to incorporate stress patterns on words. But to achieve this improvement, a set of stress prediction rules amenable to computer implementation is needed. This paper evaluates one such theory for predicting stress, that of Liberman and Prince. It first gives an overview of the theory and then discusses modifications which were necessary for computer implementation. It then describes an experiment which was performed to determine the model&apos;s strengths and shortcomings. The paper concludes with the results of that study.</abstract>

II THE LIBERMAN-PRINCE MODEL In addition to the attention it received, the Liberman-Prince model (9] (hereafter referred to as the LP model) is attractive for computer application for two other reasons. First, the majority of its rules can be applied without knowledge of the lexical category (part-of-speech) of the word being processed since the rules are based only on the sequences and attributes of letters in a word. This feature is especially important in an unrestricted text-to-speech translation system. Secondly, since the metrical trees that define the prominence relations are a commo</context>

Of the 66 words that were incorrectly stressed, most fall into one of four categories. 1) Two syllable words where the vowel pattern is -long -long or +long +1ong and the last syllable is stressed. In these cases the stress system incorrectly assigns stress to the first vowel: e.g., transact, mistrust. 2) Words in which the ESP or SRR skips over # 25(128) 1(4) syllables that should be stressed, e.g. isodynamic, epoxy, comprehend, remitter, % 19.53 25. inopportune.

As the names imply, the first and second rules deal with assignment of + or - stress, while the third predicts which vowels should be 1921. All three rules operate within a word from right to left. In the first stage, the shape of the penultimate (next-to-last) syllable determines the assignment of the + stress attribute using the ESR rule. &amp;quot;If the penultimate vowel is short and followed by (at most) one consonant, then stress falls on the preceding syllable,&amp;quot; [9] as in Table 1(a). &amp;quot;If the penultimate vowel is long (Table 1(b)) or followed by two or more consonants (Table 1(c)) then it must bear stress itself.&amp;quot; (9] Each of the previous statements assumes the final vowel is short. The fourth case of the ESR says that if the final vowel is long then it must bear stress. Table 1(d). (See (9) for exceptions to this first stage.) In the second stage, the +stress attribute is assigned based on the position of the leftmost +stress vowel in the word. Since the rule retracts stress across the word it is called the Stress Retraction Rule (SRR). The ESR and SRR m</context>

The English Destressing Rule (EDR) is used to determine which vowels should be reduced. Generally two things happen when a vowel is reduced. First, it will lose its +stress attribute and secondly, the vowel sound will be reduced to a schwa (an indeterminate sound in many unstressed syllables, e.g. the leading a in America). The rule is based on the tree prominence relations of the metrical trees, and is restricted to operating on only those vowels that have been marked +stress by either the ESR or SRR (see [9]). Finally the Exceptionless Vowel Lengthening Rule (see [91) is applied to handle apparent exceptions in the operation of the ESR, e.g. words such as alien, simultaneous, radium and labia which contain a vowel sequence preceding the vowel to be stressed. III IMPLEMENTATION Converting a theoretical model such as that proposed by LP into a computerized implementation poses problems. One concern is whether the rules and definitions of the theory are well suited to a computer implementation, or if not, must they be transformed to such an extent that they no longer resemble the originals?
