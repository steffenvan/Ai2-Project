As research in natural language processing
spawns commercial products, as it now begins to,
our research community acquires new ethical and
practical responsibilities. All software packages
have limitations, and research progress consists
in devising techniques that lead to reducing these
limitations. There is every reason to believe
that currently available natural language
interfaces may be of significant value to those
who purchase them, despite their limitations, and
that their successors will be of even greater
value. Our responsibility to accurately convey
the limitations of existing systems, as well as
their capabilities, is two-fold: an ethical
responsibility to the public not to mislead
potential consumers, and a practical
responsibility to each other not to destroy the
credibility of future research results that lead
to enhanced language processing capabilities.
How are we living up to this responsibility?
One commercially available product now advertises
by depicting users that are satisfied because they
can &amp;quot;simply type [their] question in everyday
conversational dialogue, PHRASED ANY WAY [THEY]
LIKE [emphasis added]&amp;quot;. Another boasts an
&amp;quot;understanding of UNRESTRICTED [emphasis added]
English queries comparable to a human&apos;s&amp;quot;. The
former acknowledges that &amp;quot;every product has a
limit to what it can do- (The only English
sentence offered as beyond the system&apos;s
capability, however, is: &amp;quot;To be or not to be.
But the latter proudly asserts:
&amp;quot;DISADVANTAGES: none&amp;quot;. The former is at best
misleading. But the latter makes a mockery of
both the intellectual content of our discipline
and the basic principles of honesty in
advertising.
How do we assess the limitations of natural
language systems? When we are presented with a
user-computer interaction, whether in a live
demonstration or in a scholarly paper such as
those being presented at this conference, there is
an implicit trust. We assume, for example, that
each sentence being processed is really being
processed, and further that each sentence is
merely one instance of a large class of similar
sentences, all of which can be processed in like
fashion. Likewise, when we see cooperative,
seemingly intelligent responses to queries, we
assume that there is some generality to the
intelligence, that it will exhibit itself in a
variety of different circumstances, and will
transport itself to different domains.
Thus we as a community would be shocked to
hear reports of public demonstrations of INSTALLED
natural language systems where unexpected
deviations from planned presentations expose what
appear to be &amp;quot;canned&amp;quot; responses rather than
intelligent language processing. If such
incidents were to occur, there would be great
cause for alarm. The implicit trust I referred to
earlier would have been violated, and the very
integrity of our discipline called into question.
To retain credibility as a responsible research
community, we must devise better methods for
evaluating research, ways of exposing hucksters
and charlatans in our midst, and some means of
enforcing standards that guard against overzealous
and unprincipled marketing of commercial products.
Sensible research of course takes many
shapes. Among the key issues of our field that
make good sense to address are the following:

1. new techniques for representation or
processing
2. limitations of existing techniques
3. comparisons among existing techniques

4. new problems for theories of represen-
tation or processing
5. properties of system design that ensure
desirable functioning (e.g., discussions of
modularity and portability)

6. assessing the limitations of existing
systems

<bodyText confidence="0.991796235294118">
The papers in this session touch on several
such issues. Boguraev and Sparck Jones discuss
number 5; both Finin and Palmer and Pazzani and
Engelman touch on number 3; Montgomery is
concerned with number 4; Lehnert and Shwartz
address number 6. In some cases the contribution
being made is clear. In other cases, I for one
find it difficult to assess whether the systems
being described do what they do in a principled
way that will generalize to other applications, or
in an ad hoc fashion that is devoid of
intellectual interest. In the absence of agreed-
upon standards for evaluating descriptions of such
systems, I can only urge both authors and audience
to address the Issues I have raised, doubtless not
for the first time, in the oral presentations and
subsequent discussion.
