As the development of information
technologies makes progress, large
morphologically annotated corpora become
a necessity, as they are necessary for
moving onto higher levels of language
computerisation (e. g. automatic syntactic
and semantic analysis, information
extraction, machine translation). Research
of morphological disambiguation and
morphological annotation of the 100
million word Lithuanian corpus are
presented in the article. Statistical methods
have enabled to develop the automatic tool
of morphological annotation for
Lithuanian, with the disambiguation
precision of 94%. Statistical data about the
distribution of parts of speech, most
frequent wordforms, and lemmas, in the
annotated Corpus of The Contemporary
Lithuanian Language is also presented.

The goal of this paper is to present the experience
and results of compiling a large Lithuanian
morphologically annotated corpus by using an
available Lithuanian morphological analyser and
dealing with the disambiguation problem.
The Corpus of the Contemporary Lithuanian
Language is a database of electronic texts, which is
widely used in Lithuania. It well represents the
present Lithuanian language and its different
varieties (more about that in http://donelaitis.vdu.lt/).

Morphological annotation of the corpus will
further increase capabilities of the corpus enabling
extraction of unambiguous lexical and morpho-
logical information. The annotated corpus will
soon be accessible for search on the internet. At the
moment this corpus is fully accessible only at the
Centre of Computational Linguistics of the
Vytautas Magnus University. The tools for
annotating Lithuanian texts are available for
research purposes by request.
The Lithuanian morphological analyser
Lemuoklis (Zinkevicius, 2000) produces results of
morphological analysis of Lithuanian wordforms,
but leaves unsolved the problem of morphological
ambiguity. Considering successful application of
statistical methods in solving the morphological
ambiguity for other languages, statistical methods
have also been chosen for Lithuanian. Research of
morphological disambiguation and results of
morphological annotation of the 100 million word
Lithuanian corpus are presented in the article.

2 Morphological analysis of Lithuanian
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999936">
Morphologically ambiguous wordforms are words
or wordforms that have two or more possible
lemma interpretations or morphological annota-
tions, e. g. for the wordform kovų (en. fights, pl.
Gen.) the morphological analyser Lemuoklis
identifies two lemmas kovas (en. rook [bird] or
March [month]) and kova (en. fight), while the
wordform naktis (en. night) can be in Singular
Nominative or in Plural Accusative case (more
information on ambiguity for Lithuanian see
Rimkute, 2006).
Approximately a half of all wordforms in the
Lithuanian annotated corpus are morphologically
ambiguous (Rimkute, 2006), which is comparable
to other inflected languages, e.g. for the Czech
language it is 46% (Hajic, 2004:173).
For developing the automatic disambiguation
system a morphologically annotated training
corpus is necessary. Manual creation of 1 M word
Lithuanian annotated corpus is a very time consu-
ming task, which has taken 5 man-years to
complete. Firstly, the annotation format needs to
be developed and mastered (see Figure 1), then it is
necessary to assign a word to an appropriate part of
speech, and often it is very difficult to find a
correct grammatical reading for a word. It also
takes a lot of time reviewing and trying to put all
annotated texts into one uniform standard.

3 Automatic morphological annotation of
the Lithuanian corpus
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99988215625">
Statistical morphological disambiguation using
small manually annotated training corpora looks as
quite a simple task, when frequencies of
grammatical features are generated during the
training phase and the most likely sequence of
morphological features is found in a new text by
the help of various probability methods. Drawing
on the experience of morphological annotation
systems for other free word order languages
(D@bowski, 2004; Hajic et al., 2001; Palanisamy et
al., 2006 etc.), it is obvious that the corpus-based
method is most suitable for the developing such
systems for Lithuanian.
The Czech experience (Hladká, 2000) was very
expedient for developing automatic morphological
annotation tool for Lithuanian, especially because
Czech similarly to Lithuanian is a free word order
language. Czech research applies statistical Hidden
Markov Models and formal rule-based methods for
Czech and English languages. It is important to
note that these methods are language independent
and can be applied to Lithuanian. The only
language dependent factor is a small morpho-
logically annotated corpus for training. In various
experiments the selection of Czech morphological
features was regularized and optimised, which
helped to achieve close to English language
precision of 96%. However this precision is
achieved with a limited number of Czech morpho-
logical features. The precision of 94 % is achieved
when all features of Czech language are selected
(Hladká, 2000).

Morphologically analysed words are the input of
the automatic morphological annotation system,
while the best sequence of morphological features
is its output. Annotation of a new text involves
establishing the most likely sequence of morpho-
logical features by the help of Hidden Markov
models. Not all combinations of trigrams and
bigrams can be found even in the biggest corpora.
Therefore, the linear smoothing of the missing
cases is used, as the probability of the most likely

If a trigram tag is not found in the training
corpus then the probability of a trigram is not
assigned to zero, but rather the probability of a
bigram is included with some weight. In case no
trigram tag, bigram tag and unigram tag is found
then the probability of a trigram assumes a very
small number which is equal to 1 divided by the
size of the tagset. The highest score is assigned to a
trigram, lower – to bigram, and lowest – unigram.
The disambiguation tool has been developed at the
Centre of Computational Linguistics of the
Vytautas Magnus University using C++ tools. All
results reported in this paper are based on approach
using an accuracy criterion (number of correctly
disambiguated results divided by number of input
words). We do not use any morphological pre-
processing. A precision of 94% has been achieved
for establishing tags, which is comparable to
results achieved for other languages, when the 1
million word training corpus is used. A precision
of 99% is achieved for establishing lemmas. For
the precision test a special 50 thousand word
corpus has been used, which is not included in the
training corpus.
The following statistics has been derived from
the 1 M word training corpus1:

we consider two subsequent tags (&lt;A&gt; &lt;B&gt;) or
two tags with a gap of 1 in between (&lt;A&gt; &lt;gap&gt;

subsequent tags (&lt;A&gt; &lt;B&gt; &lt;C&gt;) or a sequence of
three tags with a gap of 1 between the first and

225,319 different lemmas have been recognized

Distribution of parts of speech in the whole 100
M word corpus does not differ significantly from
the distribution in the training corpus (see Figure
2). The biggest difference is in the number of
unknown words. There are no unknown words in
the training corpus, because it has been semi-
automatically annotated and disambiguated. The
number of unknown words in the 100 M word
corpus is influenced by morphological analyzer,
i.e., not all words are successfully recognized.
A big part of unknown words are proper nouns.
Presently the dictionary of the morphological
analyser contains 5255 high frequency proper noun
lemmas (e.g. Lietuva (en. Lithuania)), which
account for 3.2% of the vocabulary in the large
annotated corpus. In the training corpus proper
nouns account for 4.3% of the vocabulary, and we
expect the similar proportion in the large annotated
corpus. The average frequency of a proper noun
lemma is 4.6 in the training corpus. Thus we could
estimate the size of the dictionary of proper nouns
at about 250,000 lemmas.

6 The remaining problems
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999978951219513">
The achieved precision of 94% for morphological
annotation leaves some room for improvement. It
is still difficult to solve homographic problems,
where some wordforms of different words are
identical. For example, wrong lemmas are
frequently chosen for the wordforms tonas (en.
tone) and tona (en. ton), kovas (en. rook [bird]) and
kova (en. fight), Biržai (Lithuanian town) and birža
(en. stock-market).
Syncretism of grammatical cases is not always
solved correctly. Most often the incorrect analysis
is given for words of feminine gender, when
singular Genitive and plural Nominative cases are
confused (e. g. mokyklos (en. school)).
Some cases are problematic even for a human
linguist, when it is not clear which part of speech
(noun or verb) is used in such collocations: kovos
dėl teisės likti pirmajame ešelone (lit. fight/ fights
for the right to stay in the first league); kovos su
narkotikais (lit. fight/ fights against drugs); kovos
su okupantais (lit. fight/ fights against occupants).
Even if the part of speech of the word kovos is
chosen as a noun, then the ambiguity case still
remains. The broader context is needed to solve
such problems.
Interjections are not very often used in
Lithuanian, nevertheless the morphological abbre-
viation a is confused with the interjection a.
Abbreviations that are identical to Roman
numerals are often annotated incorrectly: the most
problems are caused by the abbreviation V.
Sometimes wrong lemma is chosen. The words
with fixed forms such as ir (en. and), tik (en. only)
cause many problems as they can be interjections,
particles, or adverbs. The lemma of the wordform
vienas (en. one, alone, single) is not always chosen
correctly, as this word can be a pronoun, an
adjective, a numeral, or even a proper noun. It is
hoped that some of these problems will disappear
after improving the program of morphological
analysis.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999888785714286">
The method of Hidden Markov models for
morphological annotation has allowed achieving
the precision of 94%, which is comparable to the
precision achieved for other languages, when 1 M
word training corpus is used. The precision of 99%
is achieved for establishing lemmas of Lithuanian
words. The precision measure estimates only the
process of disambiguation, while unrecognised
words are not included in the precision test.
The amount of unrecognised wordforms makes
up 5,6% of all tokens (more that 800,000 different
wordforms). In order to analyse the missing
wordforms around 100-150 thousand lemmas need
to be added to the lexicon of morphological

<abstract confidence="0.994875809523809">As the development of information technologies makes progress, large morphologically annotated corpora become a necessity, as they are necessary for moving onto higher levels of language computerisation (e. g. automatic syntactic and semantic analysis, information extraction, machine translation). Research of morphological disambiguation and morphological annotation of the 100 million word Lithuanian corpus are presented in the article. Statistical methods have enabled to develop the automatic tool of morphological annotation for Lithuanian, with the disambiguation precision of 94%. Statistical data about the distribution of parts of speech, most frequent wordforms, and lemmas, in the annotated Corpus of The Contemporary Lithuanian Language is also presented.</abstract>
