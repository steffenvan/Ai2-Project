I show that the equational treatment of ellipsis
proposed in (Dalrymple et al., 1991) can further
be viewed as modeling the effect of parallelism
on semantic interpretation. I illustrate this
claim by showing that the account straightfor-

(Dalrymple et al., 1991; Shieber et al., 1996)
(henceforth DSP) present a treatment of VP-
ellipsis which can be sketched as follows. An el-
liptical construction involves two phrases (usu-
ally clauses) which are in some sense struc-
turally parallel. Whereas the first clause (we
refer to it as the source) is semantically com-
plete, the second (or target) clause is missing
semantic material which can be recovered from
the source.
Formally the analysis consists of two com-
ponents: the representation of the overall dis-
course (i.e. source and target clauses) and an
equation which permits recovering the missing
semantics.

S is the semantic representation of the source,
S1, , Sn and T1, , 2-&apos;,„ are the semantic rep-
resentations of the parallel elements in the
source and target respectively and R represents
the relation to be recovered. The equation is
solved using Higher-Order Unification (HOU):
Given any solvable equation M = N, HOU
yields a substitution of terms for free variables
that makes M and N equal in the theory of
On—identity.
The following example illustrates the work-
ings of this analysis:

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.996770714285714">
In this case the semantic representation and the
equation associated with the overall discourse
are:
For this equation, HOU yields the substitutionl:

and as a result, the resolved semantics of the
target is:

<equation confidence="0.444217">

The DSP approach has become very influen-
tial in computational linguistics for two main
reasons. First, it accounts for a wide range of
observations concerning the interaction of VP-
ellipsis, quantification and anaphora. Second,
it bases semantic construction on a tool, HOU,
which is both theoretically and computationally
attractive. Theoretically, HOU is well-defined
and well-understood — this permits a clear un-
derstanding of both the limitations and the pre-
dictions of the approach. Computationally, it
has both a declarative and a procedural inter-
pretation — this supports both transparency and
implementation.

<note confidence="0.8327302">
1 As (Dalrymple et al., 1991) themselves observe,
HOU also yields other, linguistically invalid, solutions.

lem, see (Gardent and Kohlhase, 1996b; Gardent et al.,

In this paper, I start (section 2) by clari-
fying the relationship between DSP&apos;s proposal
and the semantic representation of discourse
anaphors. In section 3 and 4, I then show that
the HOU-treatment of ellipsis naturally extends
to provide:

Section 6 concludes and compares the approach
with related work.
2 Representing discourse anaphors
The main tenet of the DSP approach is that
interpreting an elliptical clause involves recov-
ering a relation from the source clause and ap-
plying it to the target elements. This leaves
open the question of how this procedure relates
to sentence level semantic construction and in
particular to the semantic representation of VP-
ellipsis. Consider for instance the following ex-
ample:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.81633">
(2) Jon runs but Peter doesn&apos;t.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9241884">
Under the DSP analysis, the unresolved se-
mantics of (2) is (3)a and equation (3)b is set
up. HOU yields the solution given in (3)c and
as a result, the semantics of the target clause
Peter doesn&apos;t is (3)d.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9029244">
(3) a. pos(run(jon)) A R(neg)(peter)
b. R(pos)(jon) pos(run(jon))
c. A0Ax.0(run(x))1
d. AO Ax. 0 (run(x)) (neg) (peter)
neg (run (peter))
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99991337037037">
It is unclear how the semantic representa-
tion (3)a comes about. Under a Montague-type
approach where syntactic categories map onto
semantic types, the semantic type of a VP-
Ellipsis is (et), the type of properties of individ-
uals i.e. unary relations, not binary ones. And
under a standard treatment of subject NPs and
auxiliaries, one would expect the representation
of the target clause to be neg(P(peter)) not
P(neg)(peter). There is thus a discrepancy be-
tween the representation DSP posit for the tar-
get, and the semantics generated by a standard,
Montague-style semantic construction module.
Furthermore, although DSP only apply their
analysis to VP-ellipsis, they have in mind a
much broader range of applications:
[...] many other elliptical phenom-
ena and related phenomena subject to
multiple readings akin to the strict and
sloppy readings discussed here may be
analysed using the same techniques
(Dalrymple et al., 1991, page 450).
In particular, one would expect the HOU-
analysis to support a general theory of sloppy
identity. For instance, one would expect it to
account for the sloppy interpretation (I&apos;ll kiss
you if you don&apos;t want me to kiss you) of (4).
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.802933">
(4) I&apos;ll [help youll if you [want me to1]2.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.900466571428572">
I&apos;ll kiss you if you don&apos;t2.
But for such cases, the discrepancy between
the semantic representation generated by se-
mantic construction and the DSP representa-
tion of the target is even more obvious. Assum-
ing help and kiss are the parallel elements, the
equation generated by the DSP proposal is:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.947117">
R(h) wt(you, h(i, you)) —&gt; h(i, you)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998015">
and accordingly, the semantic representation of
the target is -,R(k) which is in stark contrast
with what one could reasonably expect from a
standard semantic construction process namely:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.476503">
(you) --+ k(i, you).
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9356548125">
What is missing is a constraint which states
that the representation of the target must unify
with the semantic representation generated by
the semantic construction component. If we in-
tegrate this constraint into the DSP account,
we get the following representations and con-
straints:
Representation S A R(Ti, • • • ,T)
Equations R(Si, . . . ,S,) = S
where T is the semantic representation gener-
ated for the target by the semantic construction
module. The second equation requires that this
representation T unifies with the representation
of the target postulated by DSP.
With this clarification in mind, example (2) is
handled as follows. The semantic representation

of (2) is (6)a where the semantic representation
of the target clause is the representation one
would expect from a standard Montague-style
semantic construction process. The equations
are as given in (6)b-c where C represents the se-
mantics shared by the parallel structures and P
the VP-Ellipsis. HOU then yields the solution
in (6)d: the value of C is that relation shared
by the two structures i.e. a binary relation as
in DSP. However the value of P (the semantic
representation of the VPE) is a property - as
befits a verbal phrase.
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.882817714285714">
(6) a. pos(run(jon)) A neg(P(peter))

d. {C A0Ax.0(run(x)),P
Ax.run(x)}
e. A0Ax 0 (run (x)) (neg) (peter)
neg (run (peter))
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.965057897435897">
In sum, provided one equation is added to
the DSP system, the relation between the
HOU-approach to VP-ellipsis and standard
Montague-style semantic construction becomes
transparent. Furthermore it also becomes im-
mediately obvious that the DSP approach does
indeed generalise to a much wider range of data
than just VP-Ellipsis. The key point is that
there is now not just one, but several, free vari-
ables coming into play; and that although the
free variable C always represents the semantics
shared by two parallel structures, the free vari-
able(s) occuring in the semantic representation
of the target may represent any kind of un-
resolved discourse anaphors - not just ellipsis.
Consider the following example for instance:
(7) Joni took hisi wife to the station. No,
BILL took his wife to the station.
There is no ellipsis in the target, yet the
discourse is ambiguous between a strict and a
sloppy interpretation2 and one would expect the
HOU-analysis to extend to such cases. Which
indeed is the case. The analysis goes as follows.
21 assume that in the target took his wife to the station
is deaccented. In such cases, it is clear that the ambiguity
of his is restricted by parallelism i.e. is a sloppy/strict
ambiguity rather than just an ambiguity in the choice of
antecedent.
As for ellipsis, anaphors in the source are
resolved, whereas discourse anaphors in the
target are represented using free variables
(alternatively, we could resolve them first and
let HOU filter unsuitable resolutions out).
Specifically, the target pronoun his is repre-
sented by the free variable X and therefore we
have the following representation and equations:
HOU yields inter alia two solutions for these
equations, the first yielding a strict and the sec-
ond, a sloppy reading:

3 Parallelism and Focus
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9992738">
Since (Jackendoff, 1972), it is widely agreed that
focus can affect the truth-conditions of a sen-
tence3. The following examples illustrate this,
where upper-letters indicate prosodic promi-
nence and thereby focus.
</bodyText>

Whereas (8a) says that the only person intro-
duced by Jon to Sue is Mary, (813) states that
the only person Jon introduced Mary to, is Sue.
To capture this effect of focus on semantics,
a focus va/ue4 is used which in essence, is the

Here I follow (Jackendoff, 1972) and use it to refer to
the semantics of that part of the sentence which is (or
contains an element that is) prosodically prominent.
4This focus value is defined and termed differently
by different authors: Jackendoff (Jackendoff, 1972) calls
it the presuppositional set, Rooth (Rooth, 1992b) the
Alternative Set and Krifka (Krifka, 1992) the Ground.

Thus the HOU-approach captures cases of
sloppy identity which do not involve ellipsis.
More generally, the HOU-approach can be
viewed as modeling the effect of parallelism on
interpretation. In what follows, I substantiate
this claim by considering two such cases: first,
the interaction of parallelism and sloppy iden-
tity and second, the interaction of parallelism
and focus.

set of semantic objects obtained by making an
appropriate substitution in the focus position.
For instance, in (Gardent and Kohlhase, 1996a),
the focus value of (8a) is defined with the help
of the equation:
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.577379">
Focus Value Equation Sem = X(F)
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999621">
where Sem is the semantic of the sentence
without the focus operator (e.g. intro(j,m,$) for
(8)), F represents the focus and X helps deter-
mine the value of the focus variable (written X)
as follows:

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.97921">
Given (8a), the focus value equation is thus

In a deaccenting context, the focus might be
part of the deaccented material and therefore
not prosodically prominent. Thus in (10)b, the
semantic focus Mary is deaccented because of
the partial repetition of the previous utterance.
Because they all use focus to determine the fo-
cus value and thereby the semantics of sentences
such as (8a), focus deaccenting is a challenge
for most theories of focus. So for instance, in
the HOU-analysis of both (Pulman, 1997) and
(Gardent and Kohlhase, 1996a), the right-hand
side of the focus equation for (10b) becomes
FV(F) where neither FV (the focus value) nor
F (the focus) are known. As a result, the equa-
tion is untyped and cannot be solved by Huet&apos;s
algorithm (Huet, 1976).
The solution is simple: if there is no focus,
there is no focus equation. After all, it is the
presence of a focus which triggers the formation
of a focus value.
But how do we determine the interpretation
of (10b)? Without focus equation, the focus
value remains unspecified and the representa-
tion of (10b) is:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.689942">
VP[P E FVA P —&gt; P = like(p,m)]
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.995938733333333">
which is underspecified with respect to FV.
(Rooth, 1992a) convincingly argues that
deaccenting and VP-ellipsis are constrained
by the same semantic redundancy constraint
(and that VP-ellipsis is additionally subject
to a syntactic constraint on the reconstructed
VP). Moreover, (Gardent, 1999) shows that the
equational constraints defined in (5) adequately
characterise the redundancy constraint which
holds for both VPE and deaccenting. Now
example (10b) clearly is a case of deaccenting:
because it repeats the VP of (10a), the VP only
likes mary in (10b) is deaccented. Hence the
redundancy constraint holding for both VPE
and deaccenting and encoded in (5) applies5:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.906852375">
C(j) = VP[P E {like(j,x)} A P
--+ P = like(j,m)]
C(p) =VP[P E FV A P P = like(p,m)]
These equations are solved by the following
substitution:
{C Az.VP[P E {like(z,x)} A P
P = like(z,m)],
FV {like(p,x)}}
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9898195">
so that the interpretation of (10b) is correctly
fixed to:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.690639">
VP[P E {like(p,x)} A P -+ P = like(p,m)]
</equation>

(SOE)6 such as (1013). It predicts that for these
cases, the focus value of the source is inherited
by the target through unification. Intuitively, a
sort of &amp;quot;parallelism constraint&amp;quot; is at work which
equates the interpretation of the repeated ma-
terial in an SOE with that of its source coun-
terpart.
Such an approach is in line with (Krifka,
1992) which argues that the repeated material
in an SOE is an anaphor resolving to its source
counterpart. It is also partially in line with
Rooth&apos;s account in that it similarly posits an
initially underspecified semantics for the target;
It is more specific than Rooth&apos;s however, as it
lifts this underspecification by unification. The
difference is best illustrated by an example:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.575002">
(11) ?? Jon only likes SARAH. No, PETER
only likes Mary.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999137">
Provided only likes Mary is deaccented, this
discourse is ill-formed (unless the second
speaker knows Sarah and Mary to denote the
same individual). Under the HOU-analysis
this falls out of the fact that the redundancy
constraint cannot be satisfied as there is no
unifying substitution for the following equa-
tions:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.997887333333333">
C(j) =VP[P E {like(j,x)} A P

C(p) =VP[P E FVAP—P= like(p,m)]
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999426">
In constrast, Rooth&apos;s approach does not cap-
ture the ill-formedness of (11) as it places no
constraint on the interpretation of PETER only
likes Mary other than that given by the compo-
sitional semantics of the sentence namely:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.902476">
VP[P E FV A P -÷ P = like(p,m)]
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.99983525">
where FV represents the quantification domain
of only and is pragmatically determined. With-
out going into the details of Rooth&apos;s treatment
of focus, let it suffice to say, that the first
clause does actually provide the appropriate an-
tecedent for this pragmatic anaphor so that de-
spite its ill-formedness, (11) is assigned a full-
fledged interpretation.

liberalism is necessary. Thus consider Rooth&apos;s
notorious example:

<bodyText confidence="0.998297">
This is understood to mean that people
who grow rice usually eat nothing else than
rice. But as the focus (RICE) and focus value
(Ax.eat(pwgr, x)) that need to be inherited by
the target VP only EAT rice are simply not
available from the previous context, the redun-
dancy constraint on deaccenting fails to predict
this and hence, fails to further specify the un-

Again the focus on LIKE is a contrastive fo-
cus which does not contribute information on
the quantification domain of only. In other
words, although the intended meaning of the
but-clause is of all the subjects that I like,
the only subject I like is semantics, the given
prosodic focus on LIKE fails to establish the
appropriate set of alternatives namely: all the
subjects that I like. Such cases clearly involve
inference, possibly a reasoning along the follow-
ing lines: the but conjunction indicates an ex-
pectation denial. The expectation is that if x
takes maths and semantics then x likes maths
and semantics. This expectation is thus made
salient by the discourse context and provides in
fact the set of alternatives necessary to interpret
only namely the set {like(i,sem), like (i,maths)} .
To be more specific, consider the representation
of I only like semantics:

4 Sloppy identity
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999871916666667">
As we saw in section 2, an important property of
DSP&apos;s analysis is that it predicts sloppy/strict
ambiguity for VP-Ellipsis whereby the multiple
solutions generated by HOU capture the multi-
ple readings allowed by natural language. As
(Hobbs and Kehler, 1997; Hardt, 1996) have
shown however, sloppy identity is not necessar-
ily linked to VP-ellipsis. Essentially, it can oc-
cur whenever, in a parallel configuration, the
antecedent of an anaphor/ellipsis itself contains
an anaphor/ellipsis whose antecedent is a par-
allel element. Here are some examples.

Because the HOU-analysis reconstructs the
semantics common to source and target rather
than (solely) the semantics of VP-ellipses, it can
capture the full range of sloppy/strict ambigu-
ity illustrated above (and as (Gardent, 1997)
shows some of the additional examples listed in
(Hobbs and Kehler, 1997)). Consider for in-
stance example (16). The ellipsis in the target
has an antecedent want me to which itself con-
tains a VPE whose antecedent (help you) has a
parallel counterpart in the target. As a result,
the target ellipsis has a sloppy interpretation as
well as a strict one: it can either denote the
same property as its antecedent VP want me to
help you, or its sloppy copy namely want me to
kiss you.
The point to note is that in this case, sloppy
interpretation results from a parallelism be-
tween VPs not as is more usual, from a par-
allelism between NPs. This poses no particular
problem for the HOU-analysis. As usual, the
parallel elements (help and kiss) determine the
equational constraints so that we have the fol-

Now consider example (15). The pronoun
it occurring in the second clause has a sloppy
interpretation in that it can be interpreted as
meaning Peter&apos;s paycheck, rather than Jon&apos;s
paycheck. In the literature such pronouns are
known as paycheck pronouns and are treated as
introducing a definite whose restriction is prag-
matically given (cf. e.g. (Cooper, 1979)). We
can capture this intuition by assigning paycheck
pronouns the following representation:

Thus the HOU—treatment of parallelism can
account for both paycheck pronouns and exam-
ples such as (16). Though lack of space prevents
showing how the other cases of sloppy identity
are handled, the general point should be clear:
because the HOU—approach associates sloppy
identity with parallelism rather than with VP—
ellipsis, it can capture a fairly wide range of
data providing some reasonable assumptions are
made about the representations of ellipses and
anaphors.

5 Implementation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99976732">
It is known that for the typed lambda—calculus,
HOU is only semi—decidable so that the unifi-
cation algorithm need not terminate for unsolv-
able problems. Fortunately, the class of equa-
tions that is needed for semantic construction
is a very restricted class for which much bet-
ter results hold. In particular, the fact that
free variables only occur on the left hand side
of our equations reduces the problem of find-
ing solutions to higher—order matching, a prob-
lem which is decidable for the subclass of third—
order formulae (Dowek, 1992).
These theoretical considerations have been
put into practice in the research proto-
type CHoLi, a system which permits testing
the HOU—approach to semantic construction.
Briefly, the system can: parse a sequence of sen-
tences and return its semantic representation,
interactively build the relevant equations (par-
allel elements are entered by the user and the
corresponding equations are computed by the
system) and solve them by means of HOU.
The test-suite includes approximately one
hundred examples and covers the following phe-
nomena:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.964679818181818">
• VP-ellipsis and its interaction with
anaphora, proper nouns (e.g., Mary,
Paul) and control verbs (i.e., verbs such
as try whose subject &amp;quot;control&amp;quot; i.e., is
co-referential with some other element in
the verb complement).
• Deaccenting and its interaction with
anaphora, VP-ellipsis, context and
sloppy/strict ambiguity.
• Focus with varying and ambiguous foci. It
is currently being extended to sentences

<bodyText confidence="0.999636785714285">
with multiple foci and the interaction with
deaccenting.
As mentioned in section 2 the HOU—approach
sometimes over—generates and yields solutions
which are linguistically invalid. However as
(Gardent et al., 1999) shows, this shortcoming
can be remedied using Higher—Order Colored
Unification (HOCU) rather than straight HOU.
In CHoLI both an HOU and an HOCU algo-
rithm can be used and all examples have been
tested with and without colors. In all cases, col-
ors cuts down the number of generated readings
to exactly these readings which are linguistically
acceptable.

6 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999900971428571">
It should by now be clear that the DSP—
treatment of ellipsis is better seen as a treat-
ment of the effect of semantic parallelism: the
equations constrain the interpretation of paral-
lel structures and as a side effect, a number of
linguistic phenomena are predicted e.g. VPE—
resolution, sloppy/strict ambiguity and focus
value inheritance in the case of SOEs.
There are a number of proposals (Hobbs and
Kehler, 1997; Priist et al., 1994; Asher, 1993;
Asher et al., 1997) adopting a similar approach
to parallelism and semantics of which the most
worked out is undoubtly (Hobbs and Kehler,
1997). (Hobbs and Kehler, 1997) presents a
general theory of parallelism and shows that it
provides both a fine-grained analysis of the in-
teraction between VP—ellipsis and pronominal
anaphora and a general account of sloppy iden-
tity. The approach is couched in the &amp;quot;interpre-
tation as abduction framework&amp;quot; and consists in
proving by abduction that two properties (i.e.
sentence or clause meaning) are similar. Be-
cause it interleaves a co-recursion on semantic
structures with full inferencing (to prove sim-
ilarity between semantic entities), Hobbs and
Kehler&apos;s approach is more powerful than the
HOU—approach which is based on a strictly
syntactic operation (no semantic reasoning oc-
curs). Furthermore, because it can represent
coreferences explicitely, it achieves a better ac-
count of the interaction between VP—ellipsis
and anaphora (in particular, it accounts for the
infamous &amp;quot;missing reading puzzles&amp;quot; of ellipsis
(Fiengo and May, 1994)).
On the other hand, the equational approach

provided by the HOU-treatment of parallelism
naturally supports the interaction of distinct
phenomena. We have seen that it correctly cap-
tures the interaction of parallelism and focus.
Further afield, (Niehren et al., 1997) shows that
context unification supports a purely equational
treatment of the interaction between ellipsis and
quantification whereas (Shieber et al., 1996)
presents a very extensive HOU-based treatment
of the interaction between scope and ellipsis.

There is thus a discrepancy between the representation DSP posit for the target, and the semantics generated by a standard, Montague-style semantic construction module. Furthermore, although DSP only apply their analysis to VP-ellipsis, they have in mind a much broader range of applications: [...] many other elliptical phenomena and related phenomena subject to multiple readings akin to the strict and sloppy readings discussed here may be analysed using the same techniques (Dalrymple et al., 1991, page 450). In particular, one would expect the HOUanalysis to support a general theory of sloppy identity.

Moreover, (Gardent, 1999) shows that the equational constraints defined in (5) adequately characterise the redundancy constraint which holds for both VPE and deaccenting. Now example (10b) clearly is a case of deaccenting: because it repeats the VP of (10a), the VP only likes mary in (10b) is deaccented.

There are a number of proposals (Hobbs and Kehler, 1997; Priist et al., 1994; Asher, 1993; Asher et al., 1997) adopting a similar approach to parallelism and semantics of which the most worked out is undoubtly (Hobbs and Kehler, 1997). (Hobbs and Kehler, 1997) presents a general theory of parallelism and shows that it provides both a fine-grained analysis of the interaction between VP—ellipsis and pronominal anaphora and a general account of sloppy identity.

Here I follow (Jackendoff, 1972) and use it to refer to the semantics of that part of the sentence which is (or contains an element that is) prosodically prominent. 4This focus value is defined and termed differently by different authors: Jackendoff (Jackendoff, 1972) calls it the presuppositional set, Rooth (Rooth, 1992b) the Alternative Set and Krifka (Krifka, 1992) the Ground.

In what follows, I substantiate this claim by considering two such cases: first, the interaction of parallelism and sloppy identity and second, the interaction of parallelism and focus. </context>

It predicts that for these cases, the focus value of the source is inherited by the target through unification. Intuitively, a sort of &amp;quot;parallelism constraint&amp;quot; is at work which equates the interpretation of the repeated material in an SOE with that of its source counterpart. Such an approach is in line with (Krifka, 1992) which argues that the repeated material in an SOE is an anaphor resolving to its source counterpart. It is also partially in line with Rooth&apos;s account in that it similarly posits an initially underspecified semantics for the target; It is more specific than Rooth&apos;s however, as it lifts this underspecification by unification. The difference is best illustrated by an example: (11) ?? Jon only likes SARAH. No, PETER only likes Mary.

Without going into the details of Rooth&apos;s treatment of focus, let it suffice to say, that the first clause does actually provide the appropriate antecedent for this pragmatic anaphor so that despite its ill-formedness, (11) is assigned a fullfledged interpretation. 6The terminology is borrowed from (Krifka, 1995) and refers to expressions which partially or totally repeat a previous expression.

Jon only likes MARY b. No, PETER only likes Mary. In a deaccenting context, the focus might be part of the deaccented material and therefore not prosodically prominent. Thus in (10)b, the semantic focus Mary is deaccented because of the partial repetition of the previous utterance. Because they all use focus to determine the focus value and thereby the semantics of sentences such as (8a), focus deaccenting is a challenge for most theories of focus. So for instance, in the HOU-analysis of both (Pulman, 1997) and (Gardent and Kohlhase, 1996a), the right-hand side of the focus equation for (10b) becomes FV(F) where neither FV (the focus value) nor F (the focus) are known. As a result, the equation is untyped and cannot be solved by Huet&apos;s algorithm (Huet, 1976). The solution is simple: if there is no focus, there is no focus equation. After all, it is the presence of a focus which triggers the formation of a focus value. But how do we determine the interpretation of (10b)? Without focus equation, the focus value remains unspecified and the representation of (10b) is: VP[P E FVA P —&gt; P = like(p,m)] </context>

I illustrate this claim by showing that the account straightforwardly extends to a general treatment of sloppy identity on the one hand, and to deaccented foci on the other. I also briefly discuss the results obtained in a prototype implementation. 1 Introduction (Dalrymple et al., 1991; Shieber et al., 1996) (henceforth DSP) present a treatment of VPellipsis which can be sketched as follows. An elliptical construction involves two phrases (usually clauses) which are in some sense structurally parallel. Whereas the first clause (we refer to it as the source) is semantically complete, the second (or target) clause is missing semantic material which can be recovered from the source. Formally the analysis consists of two components: the representation of the overall discourse (i.e. source and target clauses) and an equation which permits recovering the missing semantics.
