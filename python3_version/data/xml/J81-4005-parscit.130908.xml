How do computers understand natural language?
This question is asked by interested lay persons as well
as computer scientists who are not familiar with artifi-
cial intelligence. This book provides the reader with
an introduction to the field and the general flavor of
many natural language processing programs. The em-
phasis is on the positive results that have been attained
and general methods that are frequently employed.
The book opens with motivations for natural lan-
guage research: many practical advantages for user
interfaces and understanding the human mind. Subse-
quent chapters deal mainly with the first motivation.
A description of a simple natural language processor is
the vehicle used to introduce the concept of semantic
nets, rudimentary syntactic and semantic analysis, and
the inherently ambiguous nature of natural language.
Chapter 2 surveys a variety of early natural language
processing programs, including BASEBALL, SAD-
SAM, SYNTHEX, STUDENT, DEACON, and DOC-
TOR. Unfortunately, no rigorous analysis of the limi-
tations of these programs is presented, other than not-
ing the limited computing technology available at the
time and the necessary failure of a word-by-word
translation approach.
Chapter 3 is devoted to syntax, using BNF nota-
tion, transition networks, surface structure, deep struc-
ture and transformations (though no mention of
Chomsky!), followed by discussions of top-down,
bottom-up and hybrid parsing schemes. Chapters 4
and 5 present semantics. Chapter 4 is an excellent
introduction to the types of problems a semantic com-
ponent of a natural language processor must address.
For the person who has not thought deeply about the
nature of natural language, the examples clearly distin-
guish problems such as multiple word senses, modifier
attachment, noun-noun modification, pronouns, deter-
miners, ellipses, and substitution. Case frames and
concept decomposition are presented as means for
dealing with these problems. Chapter 5 is a large
collection of brief descriptions of implemented seman-
tic analyzers: Air Line Guide, ROBOT, Preference
Semantics, SOPHIE, LIFER, Linguistic String Project,
PLANES, RENDEZVOUS, and ELI. Each semantic
analyzer is presented independently; no analysis of
strengths and weaknesses is given.
The notion of frames is presented in Chapter 6,
along with a good discussion of understanding as a
memory-based process and the close coupling of natu-
ral language processing and knowledge representation.
Throughout the first six chapters, natural language
understanding is presented as single sentence under-
standing. The final chapter, however, addresses dis-
course analysis: speech acts, rules for discourse and
the difference between the rules for spoken and writ-
ten dialog.
I would recommend this book to the general reader
as a comprehensive introduction to natural language
processing that does not get bogged down with details
and the inner workings of particular implementations.
The reader will come away with an understanding of
both the enormous problems natural language under-
standing researchers must address and the many gener-
ally accepted methods of attacking these problems.
The reader will not, however, be provided with under-
lying linguistic theory, a unifying historical perspective
or an analysis of inadequacies.
Although the book is flawed by a lack of theory
and the use of formalisms, such as semantic nets and
BNF, without definition, it might be a good text for a
stand-alone introductory undergraduate Al course, if it
is supplemented with further readings and lectures that
provide more depth.
