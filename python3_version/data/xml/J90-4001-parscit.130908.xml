We present three algorithms for resolving anaphora in Slot Grammar: (1) an algorithm for interpreting
elliptical VPs in antecedent-contained deletion structures, subdeletion constructions, and intersentential
cases; (2) a syntactic filter on pronominal coreference; and (3) an algorithm for identifying the binder of an
anaphor (reflexive pronoun or the reciprocal phrase &amp;quot;each other&amp;quot;). These algorithms operate on the output of
a Slot Grammar parser, and, like the parser, they run in Prolog. The VP anaphora algorithm implements an
S-structure analysis of VP ellipsis that we argue provides a more unified and empirically motivated treatment
of VP anaphora resolution than analyses that attempt to interpret elliptical VPs at a level of logical form.
Each algorithm can operate independently of the others, and we have incorporated each into an integrated
anaphora resolution component. The interpreted elliptical VP structures that the VP anaphora algorithm
produces provide the input to the two NP anaphora resolution procedures. The integrated anaphora
resolution component provides a powerful syntactically driven module for generating partially interpreted
representations that can serve as input to semantic and discourse interpretation systems.

<bodyText confidence="0.999987785714286">
In this paper&apos; we present algorithms for handling three
different sorts of anaphora within Slot Grammar (McCord
1980, 1989b, 1990). These algorithms are second-pass
procedures that operate on the output of a Slot Grammar
parser. The parser and the algorithms constituting the
anaphora resolution component run in Prolog. In Section 2
we present a brief overview of Slot Grammar and the parser
that implements it. This section also includes a description
of an alternative network representation of parser output
on which the algorithms operate. In Section 3 we propose
an analysis of VP anaphora that involves applying rules of
interpretation directly to S-structure (parsed surface struc-
ture) rather than to LF (logical form), as required by
several recent accounts. We provide in Section 3.1 theoreti-
cal motivation for preferring our analysis to an LF treat-
ment. In Section 3.2 we present a schematic statement of
the algorithm that implements this analysis in Slot Gram-
mar, and illustrate the algorithm with examples of its
output. Section 4 is devoted to a syntactic filter on pronom-
inal anaphora that identifies noncoreferential NP-pronoun
pairs within a sentence. A more detailed presentation of the
filter algorithm is given in Lappin and McCord (1990).
Section 5 contains a rule for locating possible NP anteced-
ents for anaphors (reflexive pronouns and reciprocals). The
conjunction of the latter two algorithms has roughly the
same extension as Chomsky&apos;s (1981, 1986a) binding the-
ory. However, while the conditions of the binding theory
are stated in terms of the configurational relation of c-corn-
mand, the coreference filter and anaphor binding algorithm
employ the head-complement structures defined by Slot
Grammar.2
The three algorithms that make up the anaphora resolu-
tion component of Slot Grammar are fully modular in that
they apply independently of each other. Any two algo-
rithms in this set can be conjoined. Moreover, both the
pronominal noncoreference filter and anaphor binding algo-
rithms have been combined with the VP anaphora algo-
rithm to construct an integrated system of anaphora resolu-
tion in which the two NP anaphora rules apply to the
results of VP anaphora interpretation.3 In Section 6 we
illustrate the operation of the integrated system with exam-
ples of the representations it generates.

The original work on Slot Grammar was done around
1976-1978 and appeared in McCord (1980). Recently, a
new version (McCord 1989b, 1990) was developed in a
logic programming framework, in connection with the ma-
chine translation system LMT (McCord 1989a, 1989c,
1989d).
Slot Grammar is lexicalist and is dependency oriented.
Every phrase has a head word (with a given word sense and
morphosyntactic features). The constituents of a phrase
besides the head word, also called the modifiers of the head,
are obtained by &amp;quot;filling&amp;quot; slots associated with the head.
Slots are symbols like subj, obj, and iobj representing
grammatical relations, and are associated with a word
Computational Linguistics Volume 16, Number 4, December 1990 197

(sense) in two ways. The lexical entry for the word specifies
a set of complement slots, corresponding to logical argu-
ments of the word sense, and the grammar specifies a set of
adjunct slots for each part of speech.4 A complement slot
can be filled at most once, and an adjunct slot can by
default be filled any number of times.
The phenomena treated by augmented phrase structure
rules in some grammatical systems are treated modularly
by several different types of rules in Slot Grammar. The
most important type of rule is the (slot) filler rule, which
gives conditions (expressed largely through unification) on
the filler phrase and its relations to the higher phrase.
Filler rules are stated (normally) without reference to
conditions on order among constituents. But there are
separately stated ordering rules.5 Slot/head ordering rules
state conditions on the position (left or right) of the slot
(filler) relative to the head word. Slot/slot ordering rules
place conditions on the relative left-to-right order of (the
fillers of) two slots.
A slot is obligatory (not optional) if it must be filled,
either in the current phrase or in a raised position through
left movement or coordination. Adjunct slots are always
optional. Complement slots are optional by default, but
they may be specified to be obligatory in a particular lexical
entry, or they may be so specified in the grammar by
obligatory slot rules. Such rules may be unconditional or
be conditional on the characteristics of the higher phrase.
They also may specify that a slot is obligatory relative to
the filling of another slot. For example, the direct object
slot in English may be declared obligatory on the condition
that the indirect object slot is filled by a noun phrase.
One aim of Slot Grammar is to develop a powerful
language-independent module, a &amp;quot;shell,&amp;quot; which can be
used together with language-dependent modules, reducing
the effort of writing grammars for new languages. The Slot
Grammar shell module includes the parser, which is a
bottom-up chart parser. It also includes most of the treat-
ment of coordination, unbounded dependencies, controlled
subjects, and punctuation. And the shell contains a system
for evaluating parses, extending Heidorn&apos;s (1982) parse
metric. The Slot Grammar evaluator is used not only for
ranking final parses, as with Heidorn&apos;s, but also for pruning
away unlikely partial analyses during parsing, thus reduc-
ing the problem of parse space explosion. Parse evaluation
expresses preferences for close attachment, for choice of
complements over adjuncts, and for parallelism in coordina-
tion.
Although the shell contains most of the treatment of the
above phenomena (coordination, etc.), a small part of their
treatment is necessarily language dependent. A (language-
specific) grammar can include for instance (1) rules for
coordinating feature structures that override the defaults in
the shell; (2) declarations of slots (called extraposer slots)
that allow left extraposition of other slots out of their fillers;
(3) language-specific rules for punctuation that override
defaults; and (4) language-specific controls over parse eval-
uation that override defaults.
Currently, Slot Grammars are being developed for En-
glish (ESG) by McCord, for Danish (DSG) by Arendse
Bernth, and for German (GSG) by Ulrike Schwall. ESG
uses two lexicons: (1) a hand-coded lexicon of about 3,700
common words, and (2) the UDICT lexicon (Byrd 1983;
Klavans and Wacholder 1989) having over 60,000 lemmas,
with a heuristic interface that produces Slot Grammar—
style entries.
Our anaphora algorithms apply in a second pass to the
parse output; the remainder of this section describes Slot
Grammar syntactic analysis structures.
A syntactic structure is a tree; each node of the tree
represents a phrase in the sentence and has a unique head
word. Formally, a phrase is represented by a term
phrase(X,H,Sense,Features,SlotFrame,Ext,Mods),
where the components are as follows. (1) X is a logical
variable called the marker of the phrase. Unifications of
the marker play a crucial role in the anaphora algorithms.
(2) H is an integer representing the position of the head
word of the phrase. This integer identifies the phrase
uniquely, and is used in the anaphora algorithms as the way
of referring to phrases. (3) Sense is the word sense of the
head word. (4) Features is the feature structure of the head
word and of the phrase. It is a logic term (not an attribute-
value list), which is generally rather sparse in information,
showing mainly the part of speech and inflectional features
of the head word. (5) SlotFrame is the list of complement
slots, each slot being in the internal form slot(Slot,0b,X),
where Slot is the slot name, Ob shows whether it is an
obligatory form of Slot, and X is the slot marker. The slot
marker is unified (essentially) with the marker of the filler
phrase when the slot is filled, even remotely, as in left
movement or coordination. Such unifications are important
for the anaphora algorithms. (6) Ext is the list of slots that
have been extraposed or raised to the level of the current
phrase. (7) The last component Mods represents the modi-
fiers (daughters) of the phrase, and is of the form
mods(LMods,RMods) where LMods and RMods are the
lists of left modifiers and right modifiers, respectively. Each
member of a modifier list is of the form Slot:Phrase where
Slot is a slot and Phrase is a phrase that fills Slot. Modifier
lists reflect surface order, and a given slot may appear more
than once (if it is an adjunct). Thus modifier lists are not
attribute-value lists.
Figure 1 shows a sample parse produced by ESG for the
sentence Who did John say wanted to try to find him? The
tree is displayed by a procedure that uses only one line per
node and exhibits tree structure lines on the left. In this
display, each line (representing a node) shows (1) the tree
connection lines, (2) the slot filled by the node, (3) the word
sense predication, and (4) the feature structure. The fea-
ture structure is abbreviated here by a display option,
showing only the part of speech. The word sense predica-
tion consists of the sense name of the head word with the

following arguments. The first argument is the marker
variable for the phrase (node) itself; it is like an event or
state variable for verbs. The remaining arguments are the
marker variables of the slots in the complement slot frame
(u signifies &amp;quot;unbound&amp;quot;). As can be seen in the display, the
complement arguments are unified with the marker vari-
ables of the filler complement phrases. Note that in the
example the marker X2 of the &apos;who&apos; phrase is unified with
the subject variables of &amp;quot;want,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;try,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;find.&amp;quot; (There
are also some unifications created by adjunct slot filling,
which will not be described here.)
For the operation of our anaphora algorithms, there is a
preliminary step in which pertinent information about the
parse tree is represented in a more convenient way for the
algorithms. As indicated above, nodes (phrases) themselves
are represented by the word numbers of their head words.
Properties of phrases and relations between them are repre-
sented by unit clauses (predications) involving these inte-
gers (and other data), which are asserted into the Prolog
workspace. Because of this &amp;quot;dispersed&amp;quot; representation with
a collection of unit clauses, the original phrase structure
for the whole tree is first grounded (variables are bound to
unique constants) before the unit clauses are created.
As an example of this clausal representation, the clause
hasarg(P,X) says that phrase P has X as one of its argu-
ments; i.e., X is the slot marker variable for one of the
complement slots of P. For the above sample parse, then,
we would get clauses
hasarg(5,‘X2&apos;). hasarg(5, &apos;X 1 2&apos;).
as information about the &apos;want&apos; node (5).
As another example, the clause phmarker(P,X) is added
when phrase P has marker X. Thus for the above sample,
we would get the unit clause

<bodyText confidence="0.930852818181818">
An important predicate for our algorithms is pharg,
defined by
pharg(P, Q) phmarker(P,X) &amp; hasarg(Q, X).
This says that phrase P is an argument of phrase Q. This
includes remote arguments and controlled subjects, be-
cause of the unifications of marker variables performed by
the Slot Grammar parser. Thus for the above parse, we
would get
pharg(1,5). pharg(1,7). pharg(1,9).

3.1. THE RESOLUTION OF VP ANAPHORA AT
&amp;STRUCTURE
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99402435">
Before presenting our algorithm for the interpretation of
VP anaphora structures, we will provide motivation for the
general view of VP anaphora that the algorithm imple-
ments. We characterize VP anaphora as a relation between
the head V and selected arguments and adjuncts of a
structured empty, or partially empty, elliptical VP, and the
head A and corresponding adjuncts of an antecedent VP.
This relation is identified on S-structure parse representa-
tions. The VP anaphora interpretation procedure copies the
head A of the antecedent VP into the position of the head of
the elliptical VP, and specifies which arguments and ad-
juncts of the antecedent A are inherited by the elliptical V.
In this way, it provides an interpretation of the elliptical
VP. It is important to recognize that this procedure oper-
ates on S-structure representations rather than on a more
abstract level of LF.
Let us briefly consider the case for an LF-based ap-
proach to VP anaphora resolution. The elliptical VP in the
relative clause of the object NP in 1 is contained in the
matrix VP, which is its antecedent.

1. Dulles suspected everyone who Angelton did.
As May (1985) observes, if we copy the matrix VP into the
position of the empty VP at S-structure, an interpretive
regress results. The empty VP will reappear in the copied
matrix VP. May proposes to solve this problem by applying
the operation of quantifier raising (QR) to the object NP in
1. QR adjoins the quantified NP to the matrix sentence to
derive the LF representation 2.6

May concludes that antecedent-contained deletion (ACD)
structures can only be interpreted by a VP copying rule
that applies at LF.
There are at least two serious difficulties with May&apos;s
analysis of ACD structures.&apos; First, as Haik (1987) points
out, the wh-phrase in the relative clause of an ACD sen-
tence such as 1 is constrained by subjacency.
4a. John read everything which Bill believes he did.
b. *John read everything which Bill believes the claim
that he did.
On May&apos;s analysis, the VP in the relative clause in 1 and
4a—b is empty at S-structure, and the wh-phrase binds a
trace only after VP copying has applied to the LF produced
by the movement of the object NP. But it is generally
agreed that subjacency is a condition that constrains opera-
tor-trace binding chains only at S-structure.8 Given May&apos;s
account, there is no trace at S-structure for the wh-operator
to bind in 1 and 4a—b. Therefore, it is unclear how, on this
analysis, subjacency can constrain wh-movement in ACD
structures.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.876820888888889">
May (in press) seeks to avoid this problem by suggesting
that subjacency does, in fact, apply at LF. The examples in
5 indicate that this is not the case.
5a. At least one critic reviewed Mary&apos;s biography of each
author.
b. Who did at least one critic review
[Npa biography oft]
c. *Who did at least one critic review
[NpMary&apos;s biography oft]
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.955860157894737">
5a permits two scope readings for &amp;quot;each author&amp;quot; relative to
&amp;quot;at least one critic.&amp;quot; On the narrow scope reading, a single
critic reviewed all of Mary&apos;s biographies. When &amp;quot;each
author&amp;quot; receives wide scope, there is at least one (possibly
different) critic for each of Mary&apos;s biographies of an au-
thor. If we accept May&apos;s view that the scope of a quantified
NP is, in part, defined in terms of the constituent to which it
is adjoined by QR, the fact that &amp;quot;each author&amp;quot; can take
wide scope relative to &amp;quot;at least one critic&amp;quot; indicates that
QR can move the former NP out of the NP &amp;quot;Mary&apos;s
biography of each author.&amp;quot; But 5b—c shows that the latter
NP defines a syntactic island for wh-movement. It seems,
then, that subjacency does constrain binding chains visible
at S-structure, but not scope assignment.
The fact that antecedent-contained VP anaphora exhib-
its subjacency effects strongly suggests that the elliptical
VP in these cases is not necessarily empty at S-structure,
but may contain a trace bound by a wh-phase (or other
operator).
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.962849684210526">
Second, May&apos;s analysis does not extend to the subdele-
tion variety of ACD, where arguments and adjuncts of an
empty verb are realized within the partially elliptical VP
that it heads, as in the sentences in 6.9
6a. John writes more books than Bill does articles.
b. The university gives more money to the library for
books than the city does to the orchestra for instru-
ments.
c. The university gives more money to the library for
periodicals than it does for books.
d. John wrote more articles for the journal about politics
than he did about linguistics.
e. John showed everything to Mary which he did to Bill.
f. Mary argues about politics with everyone who she
does about linguistics.
g. Mary arrived in London before Sam did in New
York.
h. John reviewed the play for The New York Times
shortly after Bill did for The Washington Post.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9996768">
As these examples illustrate, subdeletion occurs in a
variety of syntactic environments, including comparative
NPs (6a—d), relative clauses (6e—f), and adverbial phrases
(6g--h). Given that May&apos;s analysis treats VP anaphora as a
global relation between an empty VP and an antecedent
VP, it does not cover subdeletion, where an anaphoric
relation holds between the head and selected constituents of
an elliptical VP and its antecedent. But the full and subde-
letion varieties of ACD are closely related phenomena, and
an analysis that provides a unified explanation of both types
of VP anaphora is clearly preferable to an account that
handles only one type of antecedent-contained anaphora.
It is possible to capture the properties of ACD structures
that create problems for May&apos;s LF analysis if we assume
that the empty VP of a VP anaphora environment is
structured, and may contain arguments or adjuncts of the
head.rn The arguments appearing in a partially empty
elliptical VP can be lexically realized, or they may be traces
(or their counterparts in Slot Grammar). If we apply this
analysis to 1, we obtain 7a as its S-structure.

<bodyText confidence="0.957683358974359">
In 7a, the object of the head of the elliptical VP is realized
as a trace, and the VP is interpreted by copying only the
head. &amp;quot;suspected,&amp;quot; of the antecedent VP into the position of
the empty head to yield 7b. Therefore, the interpretive
regress is avoided without QR. Moreover, subjacency viola-
tions can be identified at S-structure by computing the
relation between the wh-phrase and the trace that it binds.
Oar proposal handles subdeletion in a natural and
straightforward way. The only difference between the sub-
delet ion structures in 6 and the ACD structure in 7a is that
200 Computational Linguistics Volume 16, Number 4, December 1990
Shalom Lappin and Michael McCord Anaphora Resolution in Slot Grammar
arguments and adjuncts of the elliptical verbs in 6 are
lexically realized, while the object of the elliptical verb in
7a is not. The interpretation procedure is the same for the
two cases. The head of the antecedent VP is copied into the
head of the elliptical VP. If any arguments or adjuncts are
missing in the elliptical VP and corresponding arguments
or adjuncts are realized in the antecedent VP, the latter are
inherited by the head of the former.
This approach can be extended to intersentential VP
anaphora cases like 8.11
8. John arrived yesterday, and Mary did too.
We simply treat the anaphoric relation in these cases as
holding between the head and constituents of a structured
empty VP, and the head and counterpart constituents of a
full VP in another conjunct or sentence.
Subdeletion is generally marginal with intersentential
VP anaphora when arguments are left in the elliptical VP.
9a. ??John writes articles, and Bill does books.
b. ?Mary spoke to Max, but Sam won&apos;t to Lucy.
However, subdeletion with adjuncts in these structures is
considerably better.
10a. John arrived today, and Bill did yesterday.
b. Max spoke after Mary, and Sam will before Lucy.
The fact that adjuncts can remain in partially empty VPs in
these cases provides motivation for applying the structured
(partially) empty VP analysis to intersentential VP ana-
phora.

b. V is contained in a relative clause that modifies a

Part A of the algorithm specifies the procedures for
identifying pairs whose first element is the head of an
antecedent VP and whose second element is the head of an
elliptical VP. Elliptical VPs are identified by the presence
of a bare auxiliary verb or the bare complementizer &amp;quot;to.&amp;quot;
In fact, for reasons of convenience, we take bare auxiliaries
and bare complementizers as standing for the head of an
elliptical VP, and so the algorithm treats them as surrogate
VP heads. A.3 defines the structural relations that hold
between the head of an elliptical VP and the head of a
possible antecedent VP.12
Part B describes the operation of generating a new
interpreted VP anaphora tree in which the head of the
antecedent VP is substituted for the head of the elliptical
VP, and the features of the new head of the interpreted
elliptical VP are adjusted in accordance with the require-
ments of this VP.
Part C characterizes a procedure for filtering the argu-
ments of the antecedent verb to determine which of them
are inherited by the head of the interpreted elliptical VP.
Similarly, Part D describes the filtering process that gives
the adjuncts of the antecedent verb that are inherited by
the interpreted elliptical verb. The combination of the new
verb heading the elliptical VP and the lists of arguments
and adjuncts it inherits from the antecedent verb provide
the interpretation of the elliptical VP.

on the basis of the network representation, we will give the
clauses pertinent to A.3.b, which identifies the case in
which the elliptical verb V is contained in a relative clause.
The top-level predicate for testing that A is an anteced-
ent of an elliptical verb V (used for implementing A.3) is
anaph(A,V). The clauses for this predicate relevant to
A.3.b are
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.898612">
anaph(A,V) 4--- arel(A,V).
arel(A, V) 4—
A = /V &amp; relcont(V,N) &amp;
(pharg(N,A) I pharg(N,T) &amp; phadjunct(T,A)).
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999462909090909">
(Here A —/B means &amp;quot;A is not equal to B&amp;quot; in IBM Prolog.)
The relation relcont(V,N) holds if V is contained in a
relative clause adjunct of noun N. The predicate pharg
(P,Q), which says that P is an argument of Q, was defined
in Section 2 in terms of the network representation. The
relation phadjunct(P,Q) says that P is an adjunct of Q, and
is also straightforwardly defined in terms of the network.
Let us consider several examples of the VP algorithm&apos;s
results. The system produces the following output. For each
ESG analysis of the input sentence, the parse tree is dis-
played, and then all pairs ( antecedent verb, elliptical verb)
found by the algorithm are displayed. Then, for each such
pair, the following three things are displayed: (1) the new
arguments inherited by the interpreted elliptical verb from
its antecedent; (2) the new adjuncts inherited by the inter-
preted elliptical verb from its antecedent; and (3) the
interpreted VP anaphora tree, as a modification of the
original parse tree.
11 in Figure 2 shows the output for May&apos;s ACD example
1. In the parse tree, variable X5 in the object slot of the
complement frame for the auxiliary &amp;quot;did&amp;quot; unifies with the
phrase marker of the head of the relative &amp;quot;everyone&amp;quot; (and
that of the wh-phrase &amp;quot;who&amp;quot;). Moreover, this variable is
marked as a trace in the internal representation of the
phrase structure from which the tree is projected. (Such a
trace is marked in the feature structure of the verb—
although it is not shown in the following abbreviated dis-
play.) Hence, the parse tree corresponds to the S-structure
given in 7a. The VP anaphora algorithm identifies
&amp;quot;suspected&amp;quot; as the antecedent of the elliptical verb (repre-
sented by the auxiliary), and substitutes it for the auxiliary
in the interpreted VP anaphora tree. No arguments or
adjuncts are inherited from the antecedent verb. The inter-
preted VP anaphora tree in 11 is the SG counterpart of the
interpreted S-structure 7b.
A similar ACD case involving an elliptical VP that
follows a bare occurrence of the complementizer &amp;quot;to&amp;quot; is
given in 12 in Figure 3. Here, the interpreted verb &amp;quot;write&amp;quot;
inherits the object argument &amp;quot;notes,&amp;quot; while its indirect
object argument is a trace bound by the wh-phrase corre-
sponding to the head of the relative clause.
In the following examples, we give the output in an
abbreviated way in order to save space. The uninterpreted
tree is not shown, and the analysis resulting from the

algorithm is shown in an abbreviated linear form, consist-
ing simply of head words and their arguments.
In 13, both &amp;quot;promise&amp;quot; and its infinitival complement
&amp;quot;read&amp;quot; satisfy the condition given in A.3.b on the anteced-
ent of an elliptical verb in a relative clause. Therefore, the
algorithm correctly generates two possible interpreted VP
anaphora trees. Tree 1 gives the reading on which &amp;quot;promise&amp;quot;
is taken as the antecedent of the head of the empty VP in
the relative clause, and the infinitival clause headed by
&amp;quot;read&amp;quot; is inherited as a new argument of the interpreted
verb. Tree 2 specifies the interpretation where &amp;quot;read&amp;quot; is
substituted for the head of the empty verb, and the trace of
the relative operator &amp;quot;which&amp;quot; is its (noninherited) argu-
ment. The algorithm correctly excludes &amp;quot;said&amp;quot; as a possible
antecedent of the empty verb in the relative clause in 14.
This is because it has a tensed rather than an infinitival
complement that contains the verb that contains the noun
modified by the relative clause. Therefore, the algorithm
produces only two possible interpretations for 14, which are
represented by the two interpreted VP anaphora trees that
it generates.

15 is a subdeletion case in which all of the arguments of
the elliptical verb are filled locally within the elliptical VP.
Hence, the algorithm substitutes the antecedent verb
&amp;quot;write&amp;quot; for the auxiliary, and fills the direct and indirect
argument slots in its frames with &amp;quot;notes&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;to Bill,&amp;quot;
respectively. It should be pointed out that the algorithm
corrects ESG&apos;s parse of &amp;quot;to Bill&amp;quot; as a PP adjunct of &amp;quot;notes&amp;quot;
in the original tree. This misparse is due to the fact that
&amp;quot;do&amp;quot; does not allow an indirect object in its frame. The
algorithm recognizes this adjunct as a possible filler for the
indirect object slot in the frame of &amp;quot;write,&amp;quot; and uses it to fill
the slot when &amp;quot;write&amp;quot; is substituted for &amp;quot;do&amp;quot; in the inter-

4 A SYNTACTIC FILTER ON PRONOMINAL
ANAPHORA
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999883916666667">
The filter consists of six conditions for NP-pronoun non-
coreference within a sentence. To state these conditions, we
use the following terminology. The agreement features of
an NP are its number, person, and gender features. We will
say that a phrase P is in the argument domain of a phrase
N if P and N are both arguments of the same head. We
will say that P is in the adjunct domain of N if N is an
argument of a head H, P is the object of a preposition
PREP, and PREP is an adjunct of H. P is the NP domain of
N if N is the determiner of a noun Q and (i) P is an
argument of Q, or (ii) P is the object of a preposition PREP
and PREP is an adjunct of Q.

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999792666666667">
A pronoun P is noncoreferential with a (nonreflexive or
nonreciprocal) noun phrase N if any of the following
conditions hold.
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.611186142857143">
I. P and N have incompatible agreement features.
II. P is in the argument domain of N.
III. P is in the adjunct domain of N.
IV. P is an argument of a head H, N is not a pronoun, and
N is contained in H.
V. P is in the NP domain of N.
VI. P is a determiner of a noun Q, and N is contained in Q.
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.996544">
Condition I rules out coreference between a pronoun and
an NP with incompatible agreement features. It will iden-
tify the co-indexed expressions in 24a—c as noncoreferen-
tial.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.910312">

b. *The woman, said that he, is funny.
c. *I, believe that she; is competent.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998556">
The filter treats ( &amp;quot;he,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;they&amp;quot;) as a noncoreferring pair,
which entails only that the intended denotation of &amp;quot;he&amp;quot;
cannot be taken as identical to that of &amp;quot;they.&amp;quot; The referent
of &amp;quot;he&amp;quot; can, of course, be a part of the referent of &amp;quot;they,&amp;quot;
and, in appropriate contexts, a discourse interpretation
system, like the LODUS system of Bernth (1988, 1989),
should be able to recognize this possibility.
Condition II covers cases in which a pronoun and an NP
are arguments of the same head, and so it rules out corefer-
ence between the coindexed expressions in 25a—d.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.7438985">

<bodyText confidence="0.989743142857143">
It is important to note that the conditions of the filter
apply to pronouns and NPs regardless of whether they are
lexically realized in argument position (25a—b), or bind the
argument slots which they fill in their heads at a distance
through control (25c) and unbounded dependency relations
(25d). This is due to the fact that the variable that fills an
argument slot is unified with the phrase marker of the head
of the phrase to which it corresponds. Therefore, it is not
necessary to incorporate empty categories such as traces
and PRO into the parse output, and compute appropriate
binding chains for these categories in order for the algo-
rithm to handle noncoreference in cases involving control
and wh-movement. Mechanisms of this kind are required
for implementations of Chomsky&apos;s binding theory in Gov-
ernment Binding—based parsers, such as those described in
Correa (1988) and Ingria and Stallard (1989).

<listItem confidence="0.56191425">
26a. *Mary; arrived with her,.

27a. *Whoi did shei say Maryi kissed?
b. *This is the man; hei said Maxi wrote about.
c. *He, likes John,&apos;s mother.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999860142857143">
The filter does permit coreference in 28a—b. &amp;quot;His&amp;quot; in 28a is
not an argument of &amp;quot;likes,&amp;quot; and so (&amp;quot;his,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;John&amp;quot;) do not
satisfy Condition IV (or any other condition of the filter).
An ordering constraint attached to Condition IV requires
that a possessive adjunct of a noun contained in a head H
follow a pronominal argument of H for this condition to
apply to the pair.

28a. His, mother likes John,.

The filter on pronominal anaphora restricts the search
space that a discourse system of anaphora resolution must
consider. Bernth has integrated the filter into LODUS
(Bernd) 1988, 1989), which resolves pronominal anaphora
and NP denotation through semantic and pragmatic rules
of inference. The anaphora resolution component of
LODUS applies only to the pronoun-NP pairs that the
syntactic filter has not identified as noncoreferential.
An example of the filter algorithm&apos;s output is given in 30
in Figure 4. The list of noncoreferential pronoun-NP pairs
appears after the parse tree. Ulrike Schwall has success-
fully implemented the algorithm in German Slot Grammar

An example of the anaphor binding algorithm&apos;s output is

example is ambiguous concerning antecedents for &amp;quot;himself,&amp;quot;
and the algorithm correctly identifies both &amp;quot;who&amp;quot; and
&amp;quot;John&amp;quot; as possible binders of the reflexive. When a dis-
course interpretation system makes use of this algorithm, it
must, of course, constrain the interpetation of anaphors by
requiring that exactly one binding pair be selected from the
list of pairs that the algorithm provides for any given
anaphor, relative to the clause in which it appears.
Ulrike Schwall has implemented the algorithm in GSG,
and 40 in Figure 5 illustrates its output for a German

Our integrated system for anaphora resolution is syntac-

variable X10 is unified with the marker of the indirect
object slot in the argument frame of this verb. Therefore,
the interpreted VP anaphora tree correctly represents the
fact that the second conjunct in 42 must be understood as
asserting that Bill spoke to the same person as John did.
The list of noncoreferential pronoun-NP pairs specifies that
&amp;quot;him&amp;quot; is distinct in reference from both &amp;quot;John&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Bill.&amp;quot;
However, in its present form, the VP anaphora algorithm
unifies the marker variables of all inherited arguments with
the appropriate slots in the frame of an interpreted verb.
This will yield incorrect results for a sentence like 46, where
&amp;quot;a book&amp;quot; is the inherited argument.
46. John read a book, and Mary did too.
On at least one possible reading of the sentence, John and
Mary read distinct books. To complete the interpretation of
elliptical VPs, it will be necessary to add procedures for
substituting new marker variables for the occurrence of
inherited arguments and adjuncts in the interpreted VP,
when these expressions need not be taken as having the
same denotations that they receive as arguments and ad-
juncts of the antecedent verb.
A related problem concerns scope assignment in sen-
tences like 47.
47. Mary spoke to everyone after Max did.
Dalrymple, Shieber, and Pereira (1990) point out that 47 is
ambiguous between a narrow scope reading on which Mary
spoke to everyone after Max spoke to everyone, and a wide
scope reading according to which everyone is such that
Mary spoke to him/her after Max spoke to him/her. At
this point, the VP anaphora algorithm generates only the
former reading, as &amp;quot;everyone&amp;quot; is inherited as an argument
by the interpreted head of the ellided VP.
We could capture the wide scope reading by modifying
our S-structure copying analysis of VP anaphora to allow
copying to apply to more abstract semantic representations.
This approach involves adopting an interpolated copying
theory of VP ellipses on which copying is permitted not only
at the level of S-structure, but also after the antecedent
clause has been assigned a partial or full semantic interpre-
tation. In the case of 47, copying could apply after
&amp;quot;everyone&amp;quot; has been assigned scope through the operation
of NP storage and a semantic variable appears in its
place.15 The result of such copying would be an interpreta-
tion on which &amp;quot;everyone&amp;quot; would have wide scope by virtue
of the fact that it binds variables in both the antecedent and
interpreted VPs. The interpolated copying analysis could
be implemented within Slot Grammar by permitting either
expressions or simply their marker variables to be inher-
ited. The former case corresponds to S-structure copying of
a constituent, the latter to copying at a level of representa-
tion to which interpretation has already applied. If &amp;quot;every-
one&amp;quot; is inherited in 47, it is, in effect, copied, and the nar-
row scope reading of the sentence results. When only its
marker variable is inherited, the semantic variable within its
scope is copied, which yields the wide scope interpretation.16
43 is particularly interesting. The sentence is a variant of
an example that May (in press) claims provides evidence
for this QR treatment of ACD structures. He maintains
that only after QR has been applied to &amp;quot;everyone who he
did&amp;quot; and the matrix VP &amp;quot;sent John to t&amp;quot; copied into the
empty VP in the relative clause, can Principle C of Chom-
sky&apos;s binding theory rule out coreference between &amp;quot;he&amp;quot; and
&amp;quot;John.&amp;quot; In fact, the application of our filter to the inter-
preted VP anaphora tree provides the correct results for
this case. This is due to the fact that the VP algorithm
identifies &amp;quot;John&amp;quot; as the inherited object of the verb that it
Computational Linguistics Volume 16, Number 4, December 1990 209
Shalom Lappin and Michael McCord Anaphora Resolution in Slot Grammar
substitutes for the elliptical verb in the new tree. Condition
II of the filter algorithm is then satisfied by ( &amp;quot;he,&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;John&amp;quot; ).17 This example provides strong support for our
treatment of VP anaphora.
In the interpreted VP anaphora tree of 44, the substi-
tuted verb &amp;quot;writes&amp;quot; inherits &amp;quot;herself&amp;quot; as a new argument,
and so we capture the &amp;quot;sloppy&amp;quot; reading of this sentence, on
which each occurrence of the reflexive is bound by the
subject of the clause in which it occurs. To obtain the
&amp;quot;strict&amp;quot; interpretation, according to which &amp;quot;herself&amp;quot; is
bound only by &amp;quot;the girl,&amp;quot; it will be necessary to allow
copying of the marker variable associated with &amp;quot;herself,&amp;quot; in
the manner required for the wide scope reading of
&amp;quot;everyone&amp;quot; in 47 (see footnote 16).
The fully integrated algorithm provides the desired re-
sults for the sentence in 45. &amp;quot;They&amp;quot; is identified as nonco-
referential with any of the NPs contained in the head of
which it is the subject. &amp;quot;They&amp;quot; binds &amp;quot;each other&amp;quot; in the
matrix clause, and &amp;quot;John and Mary&amp;quot; binds &amp;quot;each other&amp;quot; as
the determiner of the inherited argument &amp;quot;portrait&amp;quot; in the
adverbial phrase. &amp;quot;Each other&amp;quot; binds &amp;quot;themselves,&amp;quot; and so,
by transitivity of binding, &amp;quot;they&amp;quot; binds &amp;quot;themselves&amp;quot; in its
occurrence in the object NP headed by &amp;quot;portrait&amp;quot; in the
matrix clause, and &amp;quot;John and Mary&amp;quot; binds &amp;quot;themselves&amp;quot; in
its occurrence in this NP as the inherited object of the
substituted verb in the adverbial phrase.

7 CONCLUSION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999998055555556">
We have presented three implemented algorithms for ana-
phora resolution in Slot Grammar. The conjunction of the
two NP anaphora rules covers approximately the same
phenomena as Chomsky&apos;s binding theory, but these rules
do not require empty categories and the definition of bind-
ing chains in parse output. The VP anaphora algorithm
implements an S-structure analysis of VP ellipsis that we
argue offers a more unified and principled explanation of
different sorts of VP anaphora than recent LF-based ac-
counts. The success of the algorithm in providing appropri-
ate representations for the VP anaphora cases that we used
to motivate our theoretical approach supports this view.
The combination of the three algorithms constitutes a
powerful syntactically driven system for anaphora resolu-
tion in Slot Grammar. This system reduces the burden on
modules of semantic and discourse interpretation by supply-
ing partially interpreted representations to which the rules
of the latter can apply.

NOTES
1. Earlier versions of the paper were presented to the SRI natural
language group at Menlo Park, CA in June, 1990, and to the AT&amp;T
Bell Laboratories natural language and speech generation group at
Murray Hill, NJ in July, 1990. We are grateful to the participants of
these two forums for their comments. We thank Mori Rimon for
detailed and useful comments on an earlier version of the paper. We
also very much appreciate the careful reading of the paper and the
suggestions of three anonymous referees. We would particularly like
to express our thanks to Fernando Pereira and Mary Dalrymple for
extended discussion of this paper and the problems involved in VP
anaphora resolution. Their own work in this area has provided us
with considerable stimulation and insight.
2. See Reinhart (1976, 1981, 1984), and Chomsky (1981, 1986b) for
alternative definitions of c-command, and discussions of the role of
c-command in determining the possibilities for anaphora. See Lap-
pin and McCord (1990) for comparisons between the pronominal
anaphora filter in Slot Grammar and recent implementations of
Chomsky&apos;s binding theory in GB-based parsers.
3. Shortly after we designed and implemented these three algorithms
in Slot Grammar, Karen Jensen constructed three alternative proce-
dures for anaphora resolution in the PEG grammar (see Jensen 1986
for a general description of PEG). Moreover, George Heidorn has
implemented a version of our filter on pronominal anaphora in PEG.
Jensen&apos;s procedures and Heidorn&apos;s implementation of our filter
algorithm rely on and apply after a set of second-pass operations that
comprise a module referred to as PEGASUS. This module computes
deep grammatical roles from the surface configurational structures
constituting the PEG parse. (See Jensen and Heidorn 1990 for a

brief description of PEGASUS and an outline of Jensen&apos;s anaphora
resolution procedures.) By contrast, in Slot Grammar deep grammat-
ical roles are obtained directly in the course of parsing, through the
unification of complement &amp;quot;marker variables&amp;quot; with variables in the
argument frames of their heads. While PEGASUS reconstructs
deep grammatical role information (primarily) from surface config-
urational relations, the representation of these roles in Slot Gram-
mar is lexically driven and is an integral part of the parsing process.
Therefore, where Jensen&apos;s anaphora resolution procedures operate
on the output of a second-pass module (they are, in effect, third-pass
rules), our algorithms are formulated in terms of the head-
complement structures provided directly by the Slot Grammar
parser. See McCord (1984) and Lappin et al. (1989) for earlier
systems that compute deep grammatical roles from PEG&apos;s surface
parse structures.

4. The list of complement slots in the argument frame of a verb
includes its subject. Therefore, SG represents argument structure in
a manner analogous to that of LFG in that it makes no structural
distinction between the subject as an external argument of a VP and
the internal arguments of the verb, as does Government Binding
theory.
5. The distinction between slot filler rules and ordering constraints
parallels the difference between immediate dominance rules and
linear precedence rules in GPSG. See Gazdar et al. (1985) for a
characterization of ID and LP rules in GPSG. See McCord (1989b)
for more discussion of the relation of Slot Grammar to other
systems.
6. IP is an inflectional phrase, the category to which sentences corre-
spond in current versions of X&apos; theory. See Chomsky (1986b) for
details of the IP analysis of sentences.
7. May&apos;s QR-based analysis of VP anaphora extends several of the
ideas concerning the interaction of quantified NPs and VP anaphora
originally proposed in Sag (1976). Webber (1978) adopts and
modifies Sag&apos;s approach to VP anaphora within a computationally
oriented framework. See Lappin (1984) for discussion of some of the
difficulties that arise with Sag&apos;s original analysis. Lappin (in press)
presents more detailed criticism of May&apos;s account, and of a variant
of this analysis proposed in Haik (1987). This paper also deals with
Larson&apos;s (1987, 1988) extension of May&apos;s account in ACD struc-
tures in adverbial phrases. Other treatments of VP anaphora are
discussed, and motivation is given for the S-structure interpretation
view adopted here. In the following, we limit ourselves to a brief
presentation of two main arguments against the LF approach to VP
anaphora resolution, and a summary of the S-structure alternative
that we propose.
8. See Chomsky 1981 and 1986b for formulations of subjacency and
arguments to the effect that it is an S-structure constraint. Haik
presents an LF analysis of VP anaphora that classifies an empty
antecedent-contained VP as a variable bound by a wh-(or empty)
operator at S-structure. While Haik&apos;s account permits subjacency to
constrain ACD structures, it requires that the VP variable be
reanalyzed as an NP trace at LF in order to obtain a structure like 3.
This is an ad hoc and otherwise unmotivated device. See Lappin (in
press) for more detailed discussion of Haik&apos;s proposal.
9. See Bresnan (1975) and Chomsky (1977) for the classical discussion
of subdeletion.
10. The idea that empty VPs are structured was initially proposed in
Wasow (1972) and adopted in Williams (1977).
11. See Lappin (1984) and the references cited there for discussions of
intersentential VP anaphora.
12. The VP anaphora algorithm identifies an elided VP by the presence
of a bare auxiliary or infinitival complementizer. Therefore, it will
not deal with elided VPs that are not introduced by auxiliaries or the
complementizer &amp;quot;to,&amp;quot; as in (i)a-b.
(i)a. John wrote more papers than Mary.
b. Bill arrived before Lucy.

guish &amp;quot;bare&amp;quot; VP ellipsis cases of this sort from structurally similar
sentences that do not contain elided VPs, such as (ii)a—b.
(ii)a. John gave more papers than books to Mary.
b. Bill arrived before the beginning of the concert.
Extending the algorithm to cover &amp;quot;bare&apos; VP ellipsis is clearly a
nontrivial task, which is beyond the scope of our current work. We
hope to take up this matter in future research.
13. Unlike the examples where the elliptical verb is identified by the
auxiliary &amp;quot;do,&amp;quot; the elliptical verb in 19 is represented by the
auxiliary &amp;quot;be&amp;quot; rather than the antecedent verb in the list of elliptical
verb—new argument pairs. This is due to the fact that with auxiliaries
other than &amp;quot;do&amp;quot; the algorithm copies the elliptical verb immediately
after the auxiliary in the interpreted tree, while in the case of &amp;quot;do&amp;quot;
the antecedent is substituted for the auxiliary. The filtering compo-
nent of the algorithm applies after the antecedent has been inserted
into the new tree, and so it identifies the antecedent with the
elliptical verb for purposes of listing new arguments and adjuncts
when the antecedent replaces the auxiliary, but not otherwise.
14. Unfortunately, Condition III also incorrectly blocks coreference in
cases like (i)a—b, (discussed in, for example, Reinhart (1981)) when
&amp;quot;near him&amp;quot; is taken as an adverb modifying the head verb &amp;quot;saw.&amp;quot;
(i)a. Dan, saw a snake near him,.
b. Near him,, Dan, saw a snake.
The problem with the cases of this kind is that the possibilities for
pronominal coreference are notoriously susceptible to lexical varia-
tion, as indicated by (ii)—(iii).
(ii)a. John, took a book with him,.
b. *John, took a walk with him,.
(iii)a. Mary, heard music near her,.
b. ??Mary, played music near her,.
</reference>
<bodyText confidence="0.972624205128205">
A variety of syntactic and lexical semantic factors seem to be
involved in determining the possibility of coreference in these cases.
However, when no complement intervenes between the subject of a
verb and the pronominal object of its PP adjunct, coreference is
always excluded. In light of this fact and the lexically governed
complexity of the coreference patterns in structures like (i)—(iii), we
have decided to retain Condition III in its present general form.
Clearly, it would be desirable to refine it to allow for the distinctions
illustrated in the examples given here.
15. Dalrymple, Shieber, and Pereira (1990) obtain both scope readings
for 47 by permitting interaction between storage and an equational
procedure for ellipsis resolution. This procedure involves solving an
equation in which the interpretation of the source clause appears on
one side and a predication containing a higher order property
variable corresponding to the ellided VP is on the other. The
representation of the source clause in the equation can contain either
a released or an unreleased stored NP interpretation. Lappin (1984)
employs an analogous free interaction between NP storage and
interpretation to derive both the globally wide and locally (conjunct)
wide readings of &amp;quot;many windows&amp;quot; in (i). Sentences of this kind were
originally discussed in Hirshbuhler (1982).
A Canadian flag was hanging in front of many windows, and an
American flag was too.
16. It will be necessary to constrain copying at all levels by the filter on
pronominal anaphora, as the possibilities for pronominal coreference
in ellided VPs are restricted by the conditions that the filter imple-
ments. Thus, even if only the marker variable of a pronoun is
inherited by an interpreted verb, it will be identified as the (denota-
tion) marker variable of a pronoun, and subject to the pronominal
coreference filter within the VP that the interpreted verb heads.
Similarly, copying of reciprocal NPs must be restricted by the
anaphor binding algorithm at every level of copying. The situation
with respect to reflexives is less clear, given the possibility of strict as
well as sloppy readings for reflexives in the interpretation of ana-
phoric VPs.
17. The variable of the wh-phrase (which unifies with that of the head
noun of the relative clause) fills the object slot in the frame of the
elliptical (auxiliary) verb in the original tree. It is correctly reana-
lyzed as filling the indirect object slot of the substituted verb.

<abstract confidence="0.99943075">We present three algorithms for resolving anaphora in Slot Grammar: (1) an algorithm for interpreting elliptical VPs in antecedent-contained deletion structures, subdeletion constructions, and intersentential cases; (2) a syntactic filter on pronominal coreference; and (3) an algorithm for identifying the binder of an anaphor (reflexive pronoun or the reciprocal phrase &amp;quot;each other&amp;quot;). These algorithms operate on the output of a Slot Grammar parser, and, like the parser, they run in Prolog. The VP anaphora algorithm implements an S-structure analysis of VP ellipsis that we argue provides a more unified and empirically motivated treatment of VP anaphora resolution than analyses that attempt to interpret elliptical VPs at a level of logical form. Each algorithm can operate independently of the others, and we have incorporated each into an integrated anaphora resolution component. The interpreted elliptical VP structures that the VP anaphora algorithm produces provide the input to the two NP anaphora resolution procedures. The integrated anaphora resolution component provides a powerful syntactically driven module for generating partially interpreted representations that can serve as input to semantic and discourse interpretation systems.</abstract>

Currently, Slot Grammars are being developed for English (ESG) by McCord, for Danish (DSG) by Arendse Bernth, and for German (GSG) by Ulrike Schwall. ESG uses two lexicons: (1) a hand-coded lexicon of about 3,700 common words, and (2) the UDICT lexicon (Byrd 1983; Klavans and Wacholder 1989) having over 60,000 lemmas, with a heuristic interface that produces Slot Grammar— style entries.

The interpreted elliptical VP structures that the VP anaphora algorithm produces provide the input to the two NP anaphora resolution procedures. The integrated anaphora resolution component provides a powerful syntactically driven module for generating partially interpreted representations that can serve as input to semantic and discourse interpretation systems. 1 INTRODUCTION In this paper&apos; we present algorithms for handling three different sorts of anaphora within Slot Grammar (McCord 1980, 1989b, 1990). These algorithms are second-pass procedures that operate on the output of a Slot Grammar parser. The parser and the algorithms constituting the anaphora resolution component run in Prolog. In Section 2 we present a brief overview of Slot Grammar and the parser that implements it. This section also includes a description of an alternative network representation of parser output on which the algorithms operate. In Section 3 we propose an analysis of VP anaphora that involves applying rules of interpretation directly to S-structure (parsed surface structure) rather than to LF (log</context>

In this way, it provides an interpretation of the elliptical VP. It is important to recognize that this procedure operates on S-structure representations rather than on a more abstract level of LF. Let us briefly consider the case for an LF-based approach to VP anaphora resolution. The elliptical VP in the relative clause of the object NP in 1 is contained in the matrix VP, which is its antecedent. 1. Dulles suspected everyone who Angelton did. As May (1985) observes, if we copy the matrix VP into the position of the empty VP at S-structure, an interpretive regress results. The empty VP will reappear in the copied matrix VP. May proposes to solve this problem by applying the operation of quantifier raising (QR) to the object NP in 1. QR adjoins the quantified NP to the matrix sentence to derive the LF representation 2.6 Computational Linguistics Volume 16, Number 4, December 1990 199 Shalom Lappin and Michael McCord Anaphora Resolution in Slot Grammar 2.

<rawString>NOTES 1. Earlier versions of the paper were presented to the SRI natural language group at Menlo Park, CA in June, 1990, and to the AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories natural language and speech generation group at Murray Hill, NJ in July, 1990. We are grateful to the participants of these two forums for their comments. We thank Mori Rimon for detailed and useful comments on an earlier version of the paper. We also very much appreciate the careful reading of the paper and the suggestions of three anonymous referees. We would particularly like to express our thanks to Fernando Pereira and Mary Dalrymple for extended discussion of this paper and the problems involved in VP anaphora resolution. Their own work in this area has provided us with considerable stimulation and insight.</rawString>

Jensen&apos;s procedures and Heidorn&apos;s implementation of our filter algorithm rely on and apply after a set of second-pass operations that comprise a module referred to as PEGASUS. This module computes deep grammatical roles from the surface configurational structures constituting the PEG parse. (See Jensen and Heidorn 1990 for a</rawString>

In this way, it provides an interpretation of the elliptical VP. It is important to recognize that this procedure operates on S-structure representations rather than on a more abstract level of LF. Let us briefly consider the case for an LF-based approach to VP anaphora resolution. The elliptical VP in the relative clause of the object NP in 1 is contained in the matrix VP, which is its antecedent. 1. Dulles suspected everyone who Angelton did. As May (1985) observes, if we copy the matrix VP into the position of the empty VP at S-structure, an interpretive regress results. The empty VP will reappear in the copied matrix VP. May proposes to solve this problem by applying the operation of quantifier raising (QR) to the object NP in 1. QR adjoins the quantified NP to the matrix sentence to derive the LF representation 2.6 Computational Linguistics Volume 16, Number 4, December 1990 199 Shalom Lappin and Michael McCord Anaphora Resolution in Slot Grammar 2.

<rawString>7. May&apos;s QR-based analysis of VP anaphora extends several of the ideas concerning the interaction of quantified NPs and VP anaphora originally proposed in Sag (1976). Webber (1978) adopts and modifies Sag&apos;s approach to VP anaphora within a computationally oriented framework. See Lappin (1984) for discussion of some of the difficulties that arise with Sag&apos;s original analysis. Lappin (in press) presents more detailed criticism of May&apos;s account, and of a variant of this analysis proposed in Haik (1987). This paper also deals with Larson&apos;s (1987, 1988) extension of May&apos;s account in ACD structures in adverbial phrases. Other treatments of VP anaphora are discussed, and motivation is given for the S-structure interpretation view adopted here. In the following, we limit ourselves to a brief presentation of two main arguments against the LF approach to VP anaphora resolution, and a summary of the S-structure alternative that we propose.</rawString>

Haik presents an LF analysis of VP anaphora that classifies an empty antecedent-contained VP as a variable bound by a wh-(or empty) operator at S-structure. While Haik&apos;s account permits subjacency to constrain ACD structures, it requires that the VP variable be reanalyzed as an NP trace at LF in order to obtain a structure like 3. This is an ad hoc and otherwise unmotivated device. See Lappin (in press) for more detailed discussion of Haik&apos;s proposal.</title>

We provide in Section 3.1 theoretical motivation for preferring our analysis to an LF treatment. In Section 3.2 we present a schematic statement of the algorithm that implements this analysis in Slot Grammar, and illustrate the algorithm with examples of its output. Section 4 is devoted to a syntactic filter on pronominal anaphora that identifies noncoreferential NP-pronoun pairs within a sentence. A more detailed presentation of the filter algorithm is given in Lappin and McCord (1990). Section 5 contains a rule for locating possible NP antecedents for anaphors (reflexive pronouns and reciprocals). The conjunction of the latter two algorithms has roughly the same extension as Chomsky&apos;s (1981, 1986a) binding theory. However, while the conditions of the binding theory are stated in terms of the configurational relation of c-cornmand, the coreference filter and anaphor binding algorithm employ the head-complement structures defined by Slot Grammar.2 The three algorithms that make up the anaphora resolution component of Slot Grammar are fully modular in that they apply independ</context>

On at least one possible reading of the sentence, John and Mary read distinct books. To complete the interpretation of elliptical VPs, it will be necessary to add procedures for substituting new marker variables for the occurrence of inherited arguments and adjuncts in the interpreted VP, when these expressions need not be taken as having the same denotations that they receive as arguments and adjuncts of the antecedent verb. A related problem concerns scope assignment in sentences like 47. 47. Mary spoke to everyone after Max did. Dalrymple, Shieber, and Pereira (1990) point out that 47 is ambiguous between a narrow scope reading on which Mary spoke to everyone after Max spoke to everyone, and a wide scope reading according to which everyone is such that Mary spoke to him/her after Max spoke to him/her. At this point, the VP anaphora algorithm generates only the former reading, as &amp;quot;everyone&amp;quot; is inherited as an argument by the interpreted head of the ellided VP. We could capture the wide scope reading by modifying our S-structure copying analysis of VP anaphora to allow copying to apply to more abstract semantic representations.
