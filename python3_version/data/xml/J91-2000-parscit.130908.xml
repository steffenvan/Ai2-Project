Editor&apos;s Note
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9996448">
This is the second issue of Computational Linguistics in the new single-column format,
and I hope you like it. The new format allows us to substantially reduce the cost of
production of the journal. It also eases the way toward better electronic submission of
manuscripts as the journal is now produced in LATEX. We are able to use manuscripts
in LATEX directly as the starting point for production. In the near future, we will be
releasing a LATEX style file for the journal so that authors may use these style files from
the start. This not only reduces production costs, but also allows the authors more
direct control over the final appearance of their papers.
The journal is receiving more submissions than ever. We received fifty submissions
in 1990, a significant increase over 1989. Yet in the first six months of 1991, we already
have fifty-six submissions! Part of the gain is because of two special issues currently
under review, but even without those papers we have an increase in submissions over
last year&apos;s rate. To handle the higher volume, we plan to put more papers in each
issue. To make space for these papers, we are discontinuing the Abstracts section. The
number of submissions to the Abstracts section has dropped considerably in the last
two years, indicating that the section no longer fills a need.
The other major change is that we will be introducing a new section to replace
the Technical Correspondence section. Squibs and Discussions, edited by James Puste-
jovsky and Robert Ingria, will start with issue 18:1. This section is intended for results
or data that are not yet amenable to treatment in a journal paper, but which contribute
to the practical working knowledge of researchers in the field of computational lin-
guistics. The section will allow the rapid dissemination of new observations and data
that can contribute to our understanding of natural language, even when these data
and observations are not yet fully analyzed. A more detailed description of the new
section appeared in the last FINITE STRING Newsletter.
