PREFACE
This Second Conference on Applied Natural Language Processing focuses on &amp;quot;the application
</note>
<bodyText confidence="0.98918925">
of natural language processing techniques to real world problems&amp;quot; and represents many of the
advances that have been made since the Association for Computational Linguistics organized its
first such conference four years ago in Santa Monica, California.
In addition to presentations of thirty-two papers, a panel discussion on &amp;quot;Natural Language
Interfaces: Present and Future,&amp;quot; and six tutorials, the conference includes a variety of exhibits
and demonstrations. The papers, the introduction to the panel session, and abstracts of the tu-
torials are included in this volume.
Such a meeting can be a success only through the efforts of a large number of people. We
are first indebted to the authors of the 106 papers that were received, representing over a dozen
countries. While the vast majority of these papers reported on interesting and important work,
fewer than a third of the papers could be included in the program. For having to make the
difficult decisions, we are also indebted to the members of the Program Committee:

TUTORIAL ABSTRACTS
Introduction to Natural Language
Processing
James Allen, University of Rochester
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.999850321428571">
This tutorial will cover the basic concepts
underlying the construction of natural language
processing systems. These include basic parsing
techniques, semantic interpretation and the
representation of sentence meaning, as well as
knowledge representation and techniques for
understanding natural language in context. In
particular, the topics to be addressed in detail
will include augmented transition networks
(ATNs), augmented context-free grammars, the
representation of lexical meaning, especially
looking at case-grammar based representations,
and the interpretation of pronouns and ellipsis.
In addition, there will be an overview of
knowledge representation, including semantic
networks, frame-based systems, and logic, and
the use of general world knowledge in language
understanding, including scripts and plans.
Given the large range of issues and techniques,
an emphasis will be placed on those aspects
relevant to existing practical natural language
systems, such as interfaces to database systems.
The remaining issues will be more quickly sur-
veyed to give the attendee an idea of what tech-
niques will become important in the next genera-
tion of natural language systems. The lecture
notes will include an extensive bibliography of
work in each area.

The lexical information contained explicitly
and implicitly in machine-readable dictionaries
(MRDs) can support a wide range of activities in
computational linguistics, both of theoretical in-
terest and of practical importance. This tutorial
falls into two parts. The first part will focus on
some characteristics of raw lexical data in elec-
tronic sources, which make MRDs particularly
relevant to natural language processing applica-
tions. The second part will discuss how theoreti-
cal linguistic research into the lexicon can
enhance the contribution of MRDs to applied
computational linguistics.
The first half will discuss issues concerning the
placement of rich lexical resources on-line; raise
questions related to the suitability, and ultimate-
ly the utility, of MRDs for automatic natural
language processing; outline a methodology
aimed at extracting maximally usable subsets of
the dictionary with minimal introduction of er-
rors; and present ways in which specific use can
be made of the lexical data for the construction
of practical language processing systems with
substantial coverage.
The second half of the tutorial will review
current theoretical linguistic research on the lexi-
con, emphasizing proposals concerning the nature
of lexical representation and lexical organization.
This overview will provide the context for an ex-
amination of how the results of this research can
be brought to bear on the problem of extracting
syntactic and semantic information encoded in
dictionary entries, but not overtly signaled to the
dictionary user.

Spoken Language Systems:
Past, Present, and Future
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.969378428571429">
Salim Roucos, BBN Laboratories, Inc.
This tutorial will present the issues in develop-
ing spoken language systems for natural speech
communication between a person and a machine.
In particular, the performance of complex tasks
using large vocabularies and unrestricted sen-
tence structures will be examined. The first Ad-
vanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) Speech
Understanding Research project during the
seventies will be reviewed, and then the current
state-of-the-art in continuous speech recognition
and natural language processing will be
described. Finally, the types of spoken language
systems&apos; capabilities expected to be developed
during the next two to three years will be
presented.
The technical issues that will be covered in-
clude acoustic-phonetic modeling, syntax, seman-
tics, plan recognition and discourse, and the is-
sues for integrating these knowledge sources for
speech understanding. In addition, computation-
al requirements for real-time understanding, and
performance evaluation methodology will be
described. Some of the human factors of speech
understanding in the context of performing in-
teractive tasks using an integrated interface will
also be discussed.

The Technology of Natural Language
Interfaces
Carole D. Hafner, Northeastern University
</note>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999444">
This tutorial will describe the development of
natural language processing from a research to-
pic into a commercial technology. This will in-
clude a description of some key research projects
of the 1970&apos;s and early 1980&apos;s which developed
methods for building natural language query in-
terfaces, initially restricted to just one database,
and later made &amp;quot;transportable&amp;quot; to many different
applications. The further development of this
technology into commercial software products
will be discussed and illustrated by a survey of
several current products, including both micro-
computer NL systems and those offered on
higher-performance machines. The qualities a
user should look for in a NL interface will be
considered, both in terms of linguistic capabili-
ties and general ease of use. Finally, some of the
remaining &amp;quot;hard problems&amp;quot; that current technol-
ogy has not yet solved in a satisfactory way will
be discussed.

The Role of Logic in Representing
Meaning and Knowledge
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.968313761904762">
Robert C. Moore, SRI International
This tutorial will survey the use of logic to
represent the meaning of utterances and the
extra-linguistic knowledge needed to produce and
interpret utterances in natural-language process-
ing systems. Problems to be discussed in mean-
ing representation include quantification, propo-
sitional attitudes, comparatives&apos; mass terms and
plurals, tense and aspect, and event sentences
and adverbials. Logic-based methods (unifica-
tion) for systematic specification of the
correspondence between syntax and semantics in
natural language processing systems will also be
touched on. In the discussion of the representa-
tion of extra-linguistic knowledge, special atten-
tion will be devoted to the role played by
knowledge of speakers&apos; and hearers&apos; mental
states (particularly their knowledge and beliefs)
in the generation and interpretation of utter-
ances and logical formalisms for representing and
reasoning about knowledge of those states.

Machine Translation
Sergei Nirenburg, Carnegie Mellon University
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9818594">
The central problems faced by a Machine
Translation (MT) research project are 1) the
design and implementation of automatic natural
language analyzers and generators that manipu-
late morphological, syntactic, semantic and prag-
matic knowledge; and 2) the design, acquisition
and maintenance of dictionaries and grammars.
Since a short-term goal (or even medium term
goal) of building a system that performs fully au-
tomated machine translation of unconstrained
text is not feasible, an MT project must carefully
constrain its objectives.
This tutorial will describe the knowledge and
processing requirements for an MT system. It
will present and analyze the set of design choices
for MT projects including distinguishing features
such as long-term/short-term, academic/com-
mercial, fully/partially automated, direct/
transfer/interlingua, pre-/post-/interactive edit-
ing. The knowledge acquisition needs of an MT
system, with an emphasis on interactive
knowledge acquisition tools that facilitate the
task of compiling the various dictionaries for an
MT system will be discussed. In addition, expec-
tations, possibilities and prospects for immediate
application of machine translation technology
will be considered. Finally, a brief survey of MT
research and development work around the
world will be presented.
