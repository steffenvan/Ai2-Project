I read with interest the recent response by Karen
Sparck Jones (1983) to my suggestions (1983) on
improving the extent to which published accounts of
NL prototypes convey an accurate impression of the
true capabilities of the systems they describe. She
begins by confirming that I am &amp;quot;right to call for better
standards&amp;quot;, and her subsequent remarks indicate that
we are in principle in agreement. I completely agree
with her that &amp;quot;raising the standard of reporting raises
the standard not only of the reader&apos;s work but that of
the writer&apos;s&amp;quot;, so any differences in perception lie in
methods rather than goals. Accordingly, Sparck Jones
proceeds to voice concerns that

what I&apos;m asking for; and
■ I ought to &amp;quot;show the way&amp;quot; by providing the type of
report I call for.
Before responding to each of these concerns, let me
remind the reader that my proposal called for provid-

Concerning the potential length of reports adhering
to my proposal, I&apos;m in partial agreement with Sparck
Jones: an accurate and responsible account of a com-
plex piece of Al software may take some space, more
than is available in a conference paper, and much
more than one can provide in an &amp;quot;extended abstract&amp;quot;.
But I do believe a standard journal-length paper can
provide most of what I have asked for. In fact, much
of what I call for (for example, topics 1, 2, 8, and 9)
can be accommodated by a simple reorganization of
material or by adding just a few paragraphs. Beyond
this, I have clearly recognized that &amp;quot;it may be useful
for some papers to gloss over a particular topic or
make it the subject of a separate report&amp;quot;. As to
Sparck Jones&apos; inference that I would expect a complete
grammar and dictionary, I suggest that a well-designed
theory, followed by a well-thought-out implementa-
tion, will lead to a system whose capabilties can be
quite well conveyed by carefully chosen but informal
statements, especially when complemented with repre-
sentative examples. To my mind, it&apos;s the sloppy, un-
certain, ad hoc theories and systems that can only be
truly understood through exhaustive detail. We must
endeavor, where possible, to provide capabilities
whose interactions are uniformly provided for, rather
than dealing independently with specific and perhaps
arbitrary combinations of features. This will lead to
systems that are easier to understand, to experiment
with, and to learn from.
Concerning Sparck Jones&apos;s suggestion that I consid-
er some papers that come close to what I&apos;m asking for,
I admit that I have my own favorite authors and pa-
pers, but I suspect my case would in fact be weakened
by my singling out authors for what might be con-
strued as political reasons. Instead I&apos;ve settled for an
idealized benchmark which to varying degrees we all
fall short of. Incidentally, I also have my favorite
examples of bad papers that, willfully or not, lure the
reader into grossly exaggerated impressions of what a
theory or system has achieved. This makes it all the
more difficult for subsequent researchers to build hon-
estly on previous work and convince the research com-
munity of their having gone further than earlier work-
ers, as observed in McDermott (1976).
Concerning the request that I &amp;quot;take some system
and provide the kind of account of it [I] am looking
for&amp;quot;, I reiterate my basic agreement with Sparck Jones
that the problem of accurately communicating on pa-
per the capability of a complex piece of Al software,
assuming an accurate account is indeed our intent, is a
difficult matter. Though I&apos;m out of reprints, I am
willing to direct the interested reader to our latest
paper (Ballard, Lusth, and Tinkham 1984) for an idea
of what I think we can do in the short term. Since
this paper appears in a &amp;quot;professional&amp;quot; as opposed to a
fully &amp;quot;technical&amp;quot; journal (such as this one), some of
what I&apos;ve called for is intentionally omitted, for exam-
ple, detailed descriptions of processing methods (topics
5 and 7). Other information (topics 4 and 8) is given
in simplified form due to the limitations of the version
of the system being written up. The humbling experi-
ence of having written a fairly extensive paper that
compromises on what with the same pen I proposed to
readers of this journal further convinces me of the
need for intensified attention to some of the problems
I raised.

In conclusion, I suspect that, were Karen and I to
sit down to discuss these matters, as I hope we soon
shall, there would be more concensus than difference
of opinion. To the extent that the dissemination of
her thoughts and mine might help to improve the clari-
ty and credibility of published reports of NL systems,
and thus contribute indirectly to more productive re-
search, I am grateful.
