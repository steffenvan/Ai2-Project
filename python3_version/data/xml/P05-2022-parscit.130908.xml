This paper describes a word and phrase
alignment approach based on a depend-
ency analysis of French/English parallel
corpora, referred to as alignment by “syn-
tax-based propagation.” Both corpora are
analysed with a deep and robust depend-
ency parser. Starting with an anchor pair
consisting of two words that are transla-
tions of one another within aligned sen-
tences, the alignment link is propagated to
syntactically connected words.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999837">
It is now an acknowledged fact that alignment of
parallel corpora at the word and phrase level plays
a major role in bilingual linguistic resource extrac-
tion and machine translation. There are basically
two kinds of systems working at these segmenta-
tion levels: the most widespread rely on statistical
models, in particular the IBM ones (Brown et al.,
1993); others combine simpler association meas-
ures with different kinds of linguistic information
(Arhenberg et al., 2000; Barbu, 2004). Mainly
dedicated to machine translation, purely statistical
systems have gradually been enriched with syntac-
tic knowledge (Wu, 2000; Yamada &amp; Knight,
2001; Ding et al., 2003; Lin &amp; Cherry, 2003). As
pointed out in these studies, the introduction of
linguistic knowledge leads to a significant im-
provement in alignment quality.
In the method described hereafter, syntactic infor-
mation is the kernel of the alignment process. In-
deed, syntactic dependencies identified on both
sides of English/French bitexts with a parser are
used to discover correspondences between words.
This approach has been chosen in order to capture
frequent alignments as well as sparse and/or cor-
pus-specific ones. Moreover, as stressed in previ-
ous research, using syntactic dependencies seems
to be particularly well suited to coping with the
problem of linguistic variation across languages
(Hwa et al., 2002). The implemented procedure is
referred to as “syntax-based propagation”.

2 Starting hypothesis
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9959015">
The idea is to make use of dependency relations to
align words (Debili &amp; Zribi, 1996). The reasoning
is as follows (Figure 1): if there is a pair of anchor
words, i.e. if two words w1i (community in the ex-
ample) and w2m (communauté) are aligned at the
sentence level, and if there is a dependency rela-
tion between w1i (community) and w1j (ban) on the
one hand, and between w2m (communauté) and w2n
(interdire) on the other hand, then the alignment
link is propagated from the anchor pair (commu-
nity, communauté) to the syntactically connected
words (ban, interdire).

<bodyText confidence="0.999987828571429">
The syntax-based alignment was tested on three
parallel corpora aligned at the sentence level:
INRA, JOC and HLT. The first corpus was com-
piled at the National Institute for Agricultural Re-
search (INRA)1 to enrich a bilingual terminology
database used by translators. It comprises 6815
aligned sentences2 and mainly consists of research
papers and popular-science texts.
The JOC corpus was made available in the frame-
work of the ARCADE project, which focused on
the evaluation of parallel text alignment systems
(Veronis &amp; Langlais, 2000). It contains written
questions on a wide variety of topics addressed by
members of the European Parliament to the Euro-
pean Commission, as well as the corresponding
answers. It is made up of 8765 aligned sentences.
The HLT corpus was used in the evaluation of
word alignment systems described in (Mihalcea &amp;
Pederson, 2003). It contains 447 aligned sentences
from the Canadian Hansards (Och &amp; Ney, 2000).
The corpus processing was carried out by a
French/English parser, SYNTEX (Fabre &amp; Bouri-
gault, 2001). SYNTEX is a dependency parser
whose input is a POS tagged3 corpus — meaning
each word in the corpus is assigned a lemma and
grammatical tag. The parser identifies dependen-
cies in the sentences of a given corpus, for instance
subjects and direct and indirect objects of verbs.
The parsing is performed independently in each
language, yet the outputs are quite homogeneous
since the syntactic dependencies are identified and
represented in the same way in both languages.
In addition to parsed English/French bitexts, the
syntax-based alignment requires pairs of anchor
words be identified prior to propagation.

To derive a set of words that are likely to be useful
for initiating the propagation process, we imple-
mented a widely used method of co-occurrence
counts described notably in (Gale &amp; Church, 1991;
Ahrenberg et al., 2000). For each source (w1) and
target (w2) word, the Jaccard association score is
computed as follows:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.800656">
j(w1, w2) = f(w1, w2)/f(w1) + f(w2) – f(w1, w2)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.99964775">
The Jaccard is computed provided the number of
overall occurrences of w1 and w2 is higher than 4,
since statistical techniques have proved to be par-
ticularly efficient when aligning frequent units.
The alignments are filtered according to the j(w1,
w2) value, and retained if this value was 0.2 or
higher. Moreover, two further tests based on cog-
nate recognition and mutual correspondence condi-
tion are applied.
The identification of anchor pairs, consisting of
words that are translation equivalents within
aligned sentences, combines both the projection of
the initial lexicon and the recognition of cognates
for words that have not been taken into account in
the lexicon. These pairs are used as the starting
point of the propagation process4.

5.1 Two types of propagation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.8976538">
The syntax-based propagation may be performed
in two different directions, as a given word is
likely to be both governor and dependent with re-
spect to other words. The first direction starts with
dependent anchor words and propagates the align-
ment link to the governors (Dep-to-Gov propaga-
tion). The Dep-to-Gov propagation is a priori not
ambiguous since one dependent is governed at
4 The process is not iterative up to date so the number of words it allows to align
depends on the initial number of anchor words per sentence.

most by one word. Thus, there is just one relation
on which the propagation can be based. The sec-
ond direction goes the opposite way: starting with
governor anchor words, the alignment link is
propagated to their dependents (Gov-to-Dep
propagation). In this case, several relations that
may be used to achieve the propagation are avail-
able, as it is possible for a governor to have more
than one dependent. So the propagation is poten-
tially ambiguous. The ambiguity is particularly
widespread when propagating from head nouns to
their nominal and adjectival dependents. In Figure
2, there is one occurrence of the relation pcomp in
English and two in French. Thus, it is not possible
to determine a priori whether to propagate using
the relations mod/pcomp2, on the one hand, and
pcomp1/pcomp2’, on the other hand, or
mod/pcomp2’ and pcomp1/pcomp2. Moreover,
even if there is just one occurrence of the same
relation in each language, it does not mean that the
propagation is of necessity performed through the
same relation, as shown in Figure 3.

In the following sections, we describe the two
types of propagation. The propagation patterns we
rely on are given in the form CDep-rel-CGov,
where CDep is the POS of the dependent, rel is the
dependency relation and CGov, the POS of the
governor. The anchor element is underlined and
the one aligned by propagation is in bold.

The two types of propagation described in section
5.2 for use with verbs are also used to align adjec-
tives and nouns. However, these latter categories
cannot be treated in a fully independent way when
propagating from head noun anchor words in order
to align the dependents. The syntactic structure of
noun phrases may be different in English and
French, since they rely on a different type of com-
position to produce compounds and on the same
one to produce free noun phrases. Thus, the poten-
tial ambiguity arising from the Gov-to-Dep propa-
gation from head nouns mentioned in section 5.1

may be accompanied by variation phenomena af-
fecting the category of the dependents. For in-
stance, a noun may be rendered by an adjective, or
vice versa: tax treatment profits is translated by
traitement fiscal des bénéfices, so the noun tax is in
correspondence with the adjective fiscal. The syn-
tactic relations used to propagate the alignment
links are thus different.
In order to cope with the variation problem, the
propagation is performed regardless of whether the
syntactic relations are identical in both languages,
and regardless of whether the POS of the words to
be aligned are the same. To sum up, adjectives and
nouns are aligned separately of each other by
means of Dep-to-Gov propagation or Gov-to-Dep
propagation provided that the governor is not a
noun. They are not treated separately when align-
ing by means of Gov-to-Dep propagation from
head noun anchor pairs.

Considering the potential ambiguity described in
section 5.1, the algorithm which supports Gov-to-
Dep propagation from head noun anchor words
(n1, n2) takes into account three situations which
are likely to occur.
First, each of n1 and n2 has only one dependent,
respectively dep1 and dep2, involving one of the
mod or pcomp relation; dep1 and dep2 are aligned.

Second, n1 has one dependent dep1 and n2 several

dep2i, check if one of the possible alignments has
already been performed, either by propagation or
anchor word spotting. If such an alignment exists,
remove the others (dep1, dep2k) such that k ≠ i, or
vice versa. Otherwise, retain all the alignments
(dep1, dep2i), or vice versa, without resolving the
ambiguity.

Third, both n1 and n2 have several dependents,
{dep11, dep12, ..., dep1m} and {dep21, dep22, ...,
dep2n} respectively. For each dep1i and each dep2j,
check if one/several alignments have already been
performed. If such alignments exist, remove all the
alignments (dep1k, dep2l) such that k ≠ i or l ≠ j.
Otherwise, retain all the alignments (dep1i, dep2j)
without resolving the ambiguity.

The implemented propagation algorithm has two
major advantages: it permits the resolution of some
alignment ambiguities, taking advantage of align-
ments that have been previously performed. This
algorithm also allows the system to cope with the
problem of non-correspondence between English
and French syntactic structures and makes it possi-
ble to align words using various syntactic relations
in both languages, even though the category of the
words under consideration is different.

in the giza++ package (Och &amp; Ney, 2000) (Table 2

tion of IBM-4 Viterbi alignments for both transla-
tion directions. Table 2 shows the precision
assessed against a reference set of 1000 alignments
manually annotated in the INRA and the JOC cor-
pus respectively. It can be observed that the syn-
tax-based alignment offers good accuracy, similar
to that of the baseline.

More complete results (precision, recall and f-

obtained using reference data from an evaluation
of word alignment systems (Mihalcea &amp; Pederson,
2003). It should be noted that the figures concern-
ing the syntax-based alignment were assessed in
respect to the annotations that do not involve
empty words, since up to now we focused only on
content words. Whereas the baseline precision5 for
the HLT corpus is comparable to the one reported
in Table 2, the syntax-based alignment score de-
creases. Moreover, the difference between the two
approaches is considerable with regard to the re-
call. This may be due to the fact that our syntax-
based alignment approach basically relies on iso-
morphic syntactic structures, i.e. in which the two
following conditions are met: i) the relation under
consideration is identical in both languages and ii)
the words involved in the syntactic propagation
have the same POS. Most of the cases of non-
isomorphism, apart from the ones presented sec-
tion 5.1, are not taken into account.

The results achieved by the syntax-based propaga-
tion method are quite encouraging. They show a
high global precision rate — 93% for the INRA
corpus and 95% for the JOC — comparable to that
reported for the giza++ baseline system. The fig-
ures vary more from the HLT reference set. One
possible explanation is the fact that the gold stan-
dard has been established according to specific
annotation criteria. Indeed, the HLT project con-
cerned above all statistical alignment systems aim-
ing at language modelling for machine translation.
In approaches such as Lin and Cherry’s (2003),
linguistic knowledge is considered secondary to
statistical information even if it improves the
alignment quality. The syntax-based alignment
approach was designed to capture both frequent
alignments and those involving sparse or corpus-
specific words as well as to cope with the problem
of non-correspondance across languages. That is
why we chose the linguistic knowledge as the main
information source.

7 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999960052631579">
We have presented an efficient method for aligning
words in English/French parallel corpora. It makes
the most of dependency relations to produce highly
accurate alignments when the same propagation
pattern is used in both languages, i.e. when the
syntactic structures are identical, as well as in
cases of noun/adjective transpositions, even if the
category of the words to be aligned varies (Oz-
dowska, 2004). We are currently pursuing the
study of non-correspondence between syntactic
structures in English and French. The aim is to de-
termine whether there are some regularities in the
rendering of specific English structures into given
French ones. If variation across languages is sub-
ject to such regularities, as assumed in (Dorr, 1994;
Fox, 2002; Ozdowska &amp; Bourigault, 2004), the
syntax-based propagation could then be extended
to cases of non-correspondence in order to improve
recall.

Starting with an anchor pair consisting of two words that are translations of one another within aligned sentences, the alignment link is propagated to syntactically connected words.</abstract>

Lacombe who allowed us to use this corpus for research purposes. 2 The sentence-level alignment was performed using Japa (http://www.rali.iro.umontreal.ca). 3 The French and English versions of Treetagger (http://www.ims.unistuttgart.de) are used. To derive a set of words that are likely to be useful for initiating the propagation process, we implemented a widely used method of co-occurrence counts described notably in (Gale &amp; Church, 1991; Ahrenberg et al., 2000). For each source (w1) and target (w2) word, the Jaccard association score is computed as follows: j(w1, w2) = f(w1, w2)/f(w1) + f(w2) – f(w1, w2) The Jaccard is computed provided the number of overall occurrences of w1 and w2 is higher than 4, since statistical techniques have proved to be particularly efficient when aligning frequent units. The alignments are filtered according to the j(w1, w2) value, and retained if this value was 0.2 or higher.

It contains written questions on a wide variety of topics addressed by members of the European Parliament to the European Commission, as well as the corresponding answers. It is made up of 8765 aligned sentences. The HLT corpus was used in the evaluation of word alignment systems described in (Mihalcea &amp; Pederson, 2003). It contains 447 aligned sentences from the Canadian Hansards (Och &amp; Ney, 2000). The corpus processing was carried out by a French/English parser, SYNTEX (Fabre &amp; Bourigault, 2001). SYNTEX is a dependency parser whose input is a POS tagged3 corpus — meaning each word in the corpus is assigned a lemma and grammatical tag. The parser identifies dependencies in the sentences of a given corpus, for instance subjects and direct and indirect objects of verbs. The parsing is performed independently in each language, yet the outputs are quite homogeneous since the syntactic dependencies are identified and represented in the same way in both languages.

In approaches such as Lin and Cherry’s (2003), linguistic knowledge is considered secondary to statistical information even if it improves the alignment quality. The syntax-based alignment approach was designed to capture both frequent alignments and those involving sparse or corpusspecific words as well as to cope with the problem of non-correspondance across languages. That is why we chose the linguistic knowledge as the main information source. 5 Precision, recall and f-measure reported by Och and Ney (2003) for the intersection of IBM-4 Viterbi alignments from both translation directions. 131 7 Conclusion We have presented an efficient method for aligning words in English/French parallel corpora. It makes the most of dependency relations to produce highly accurate alignments when the same propagation pattern is used in both languages, i.e. when the syntactic structures are identical, as well as in cases of noun/adjective transpositions, even if the category of the words to be aligned varies (Ozdowska, 2004).
