ABSTRACT: The definition texts of a machine-readable
pocket dictionary were analyzed to determine the
disambiguated word sense of the kernel terms of each
word sense being defined. The resultant sets of word
pairs of defined and defining words were then
computationally connected into two taxonomic semi-
lattices (&amp;quot;tangled hierarchies&amp;quot;) representing some
24,000 noun nodes and 11,000 verb nodes. The study of
the nature of the &amp;quot;topmost&amp;quot; nodes in these hierarchies.
and the structure of the trees reveal information about
the nature of the dictionary&apos;s organization of the
language, the concept of semantic primitives and other
aspects of lexical semantics. The data proves that the
dictionary offers a fundamentally consistent description
of word meaning and may provide the basis for future
research and applications in computational linguistic
systems.

1. INTRODUCTION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9984834625">
In the late 1960&apos;s, John Olney et al. at System
Development Corporation produced machine-readable copies
of the Merriam-Webster NRK Pocket Dictionary and the
Merriam-Webster Seventh golleziate Dictionary. These
massive data files have been widely distributed within
the computational linguistic cammunity, yet research
upon the basic structure of the dictionary has been
exceedingly slow and difficult due to the Significant
computer resources required to process tens of thousands
of definitions.
The dictionary is a fascinating computational resource.
It contains spelling, pronunciation, hyphenation,
capitalization, usage notes for semantic domains.
geographic regions, and propriety; etymological.
syntactic and semantic information about the most basic
units of the language. Accompanying definitions are
example sentences which often use words in prototypical
contexts. Thus the dictionary should be able to serve
as a resource for a variety of computational linguistic
needs. My primary concern within the dictionary has
been the development of dictionary data for use in
understanding systems. Thus I am concerned with what
dictionary definitions tell us about the semantic and
pragmatic structure of meaning. The hypothesis I am
proposing is that definitions in the lexicon can be
studied in the same manner as other large collections of
objects such as plants, animals, and minerals are
studied. Thus I am. concerned with enumerating the
classificational organization of the lexicon as it has
been implicitly used by the dictionary&apos;s lexicographers.
Each textual definition in the dictionary is
syntactically a noun or verb phrase with one or more
kernel terms. If one identifies these kernel terms of
definitions, and then proceeds to disambiguate them
relative to the senses offered in the same dictionary
under their respective definitions, then one can arrive
at a large collection of pairs of disambiguated words
which can be assembled into a taxonomic semi-lattice.
This task has been accomplished for all the definition
texts of nouns and verbs in a common pocket dictionary.
This paper is an effort to reveal the results of a
preliminary examination of the structure of these
databases.
The applications of this data are still in the future.
What might these applications be?
First, the data should provide information on the
contents of semantic domains. One should be able to
determine from a lexical taxonomy what domains one
might be in given one has encountered the word
&amp;quot;periscope&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;petiole&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;petroleum&amp;quot;.
Second, dictionary data should be of use in resolving
semantic ambiguity in text. Words in definitions
appear in the company of their prototypical
associates.
Third, dictionary data can provide the basis for
creating case grammar descriptions of verbs. and noun
argument descriptions of nouns. Semantic templates of
meaning are far richer when one considers the
taxonomic inheritance of elements of the lexicon.
Fourth. the dictionary should offer a classification .
which anthropological linguists and psycholinguists
can use as an objective reference in comparison with
other cultures or human memory observations. This
isn&apos;t to say that the dictionary&apos;s classification is
the same as the culture&apos;s or the human mind&apos;s, only
that it is an objective datum from which comparisons
can be made.
Fifth. knowledge of how the dictionary is structured
can be used by lexicographers to build better
dictionaries.
And finally, the dictionary if converted into a
computer tool can become more readily accessible to
all the disciplines seeking to use the current
paper-based versions. Education, historical
linguistics. sociology. English composition. etc. can
all make steps forward given that they can assume
access to a dictionary is immediately available via
computer. I do not know what all these applications
will be and the task at hand is simply an elucidation
of the dictionary&apos;s structure as it currently exists.

<bodyText confidence="0.99363212">
The grant. 14CS77-01315, &amp;quot;Development of a Computational
Methodology for Deriving Natural Language Semantic
Structures via Analysis of Machine-Readable
Dictionaries&amp;quot;, created a taxonomy for the nouns and
verbs of the Merriam-Webster Pocket Dictionary (MPD),
based upon the hand-disambiguated kernel words in their
definitions. This taxonomy confirmed the anticipated
structure of the lexicon to be that of a &amp;quot;tangled
hierarchy&amp;quot; (8,9) of unprecedented size (24,000 noun
senses. 11.000 verb senses). This data base is believed
to be the first to be assembled which is representative
of the structure of the entire English lexicon. (A
somewhat similar study of the Italian lexicon has been
done (2.111). The content categories agree
substantially with the semantic structure of the lexicon
proposed by Nide [151, and the verb taxonomy confirms
the primitives proposed by the San Diego LNR group 1161.
This &amp;quot;tangled hierarchy&amp;quot; may be described as a formal
data structure whose bottom is a set of terminal
disambiguated words that are not used as kernel defining
terms; these are the most specific elements in the
structure. The tops of the structure are senses of
words such as &amp;quot;cause&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;thing&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;class&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;being&amp;quot;, etc.
These are the most general elements in the tangled
hierarchy. If all the top terms are considered to be
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.97938140625">
members of the metaclass &amp;quot;&lt;word-sense&gt;&amp;quot;, the tangled
forest becomes a tangled tree.
The terminal nodes of such trees are in general each
connected to the top in a lattice. An individual
lattice can be resolved into a set of &amp;quot;traces&amp;quot;, each of
which describes an alternate path from terminal to top.
In a trace, each element implies the terms above it, and
further specifies the sense of the elements below it.
The collection of lattices forms a transitive acyclic
digraph (or perhaps more clearly, a &amp;quot;semi-lattice&amp;quot;, that
is, a lattice with a greatest upper bound, &lt;word-sense&gt;,
but no least lower bound). If we specify all the traces
composing such a structure, spanning all paths from top
to bottom. we have topologically specified the
upon these measurements. For example. &amp;quot;g&amp;quot; has the most
single-level descendants, 3, yet it is neither at the
top of the tangled hierarchy, nor does it have the
highest total number of descendants. The root node &amp;quot;a&amp;quot;
is at the top of the hierarchy, yet it only has 1
single-level descendant. For nodes to be considered of
major importance in a tangled hierarchy it is thus
necessary to consider not only their total number of
descendants, but whether these descendants are all
actually immediately under some other node to which this
higher node is attached. As we shall see, the nodes
which have the most single-level descendants are
actually more pivotal concepts in some cases.
Turning to the actual forest of tangled hierarchies,
Table 2 gives the frequencies of the size and depth of
semi-lattice. Thus the list on the left in Figure 1 the largest noun hierarchies and Table 3 gives the sizes
topologically specifies the tangled hierarchy on its alone for verb hierarchies (depths were not computed for

topmost nodes don&apos;t have many descendants at one level
below, but they each have one BIG descendant, the next
node in the chain. CAUSE-2.0A has approximately 240
direct descendants, and MAKE-1.1A has 480 direct
descendants - making these two the topmost nodes in
terms of number of direct descendants, though they are
ranked 9th and 13th in terms of total descendants (under
words such as RE(AIN-.4A, CONTINUE-.1A, etc.). This
points out in practice what the abstract tree of Figure
1 showed as possible in theory, and explains the seeming
contradiction in having a basic verb such as
&amp;quot;CAUSE-2.0A&amp;quot; defined in terms of a lesser verb such as
&amp;quot;REMAIN-.4a&amp;quot;.
The difficulty is explainable given two facts. First.
the lexicographers HAD to define CAUSE-2.0A using some
other verb, etc. This is inherent in the lexicon being
used to define itself. Second, once one reaches the top
of a tangled hierarchy one cannot go any higher -- and
consequently forcing further definitions for basic verbs
such as &amp;quot;be&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;cause&amp;quot; invariably leads to using more
specific verbs, rather than more general ones. The
situation is neither erroneous, nor inconsistent in the
context of a self-defined closed system and will be
discussed further in the section on noun primitives.

One phenomenon which was anticipated in computationally
grown trees was the existence of loops. Loops are
caused by having sequences of interrelated definitions
whose kernels form a ring-like array (5.201. However,
what was not anticipated was how important such clusters
of nodes would be both to the underlying basis for the
taxonomies and as primitives of the language. Such
circularity is sometimes evidence of a truly primitive
concept, such as the set containing the words CLASS,
GROUP, TYPE, KIND, SET. DIVISION, CATEGORY, SPECIES,
INDIVIDUAL, GROUP/NG, PART and SECTION. To understand
this, consider the subset of interrelated senses these

This essential property, the inability to write a
definition explaining a word&apos;s meaning without using
another member of some small set of near synonymous
words, is the basis for describing such a set as a
PRIMITIVE. It is based upon the notion of definition
given by Wilder [211, which in turn was based upon a
presentation of the ideas of Padoa, a
turn-of-the-century logician.
The definitions are given, the disambiguation of their
kernel&apos;s senses leads to a cyclic structure which cannot
be resolved by attributing erroneous judgements to
either the lexicographer or the disambiguator; therefore
the structure is taken as representative of an
undefinable primitive concept, and the words whose
definitions participate in this complex structure are
found to be undefinable without reference to the other
members of the set of undefined terms.
The question of what to do with such primitives is not
really a problem. as Winograd notes [221, once one
realizes that they must exist at some level, just as
mathematical primitives must exist. In tree
construction the solution is to form a single node whose
English surface representation may be selected from any
of the words in the primitive set. There probably are
connotative differences between the members of the set.
but the ordinary pocket dictionary does not treat these
in its definitions with any detail. The Merriam-Webster
Colleziate Dictionary does include so-called &amp;quot;synonym
paragraphs&amp;quot; which seem to discuss the connotative
differences between words sharing a &amp;quot;ring&amp;quot;.
While numerous studies of lexical domains such as the
verbs of motion [1.12,131 and possession [101 have been
carried out by other researchers, it is worth noting
that recourse to using ordinary dictionary definitions
as a source of material has received little attention.
Yet the &amp;quot;primitives&amp;quot; selected by Donald A. Norman,
David E. Rumelhart, and the LNR Research Group for
knowledge representation in their system bear a
remarkable similarity to those verbs used most often as
kernels in The MerriamWebster Pocket Dictionary and
Donald Sherman has shown (Table 4) these topmost verbs
to be among the most common verbs in the Collegiate
Dictionary as well [191. The most frequent verbs of the
MPD are, in descending order. MAKE, BE. BECOME, CAUSE.
GIVE, MOVE, TAKE, PUT, FORM, BRING, HAVE. and GO. The
similarity of these verbs to those selected by the LNR
group for their semantic representations, i.e., BECOME.
CAUSE. CHANGE, DO, MOVE. POSS (&amp;quot;have&amp;quot;), TRANSF
(&amp;quot;give&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;take&amp;quot;), etc., [10.14.181 is striking. This
similarity is indicative of an underlying &amp;quot;rightness&amp;quot; of
dictionary definitions and supports the proposition that
the lexical information extractable from study of the
dictionary will prove to be the same knowledge needed
for computational linguistics.
The enumeration of the primitives for nouns and verbs by
analysis of the tangled hierarchies of the noun and verb
forests grown from the MPD definitions is a considerable
undertaking and one which goes beyond the scope of this
paper. To see an example of how this technique works in
practice, consider the discovery of the primitive group
starting from PLACE-1.3A.
place-1.3a - a building or locality used for a
special purpose
The kernels of this definition are &amp;quot;building&amp;quot; and
&amp;quot;locality&amp;quot;. Looking these up in turn we have:
building-As - a usu. roofed and walled structure
(as a house) for permanent use
locality-.0a - a particular soot situation or
location

In addition to terminating in &amp;quot;dictionary circles&amp;quot; or

&amp;quot;carry&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;transport&amp;quot;.
vehicle - a means of carrying or transporting
something
&amp;quot;Leaf&amp;quot; is an example of the latter, being defined as a
part of a plant,
leaf - a usu. flat and green outgrowth of a plant
stem that is a unit of foliage and functions
esp. in photosynthesis.
Thus &amp;quot;leaf&amp;quot; isn&apos;t a type of anything. Even though under
a strictly genus/differentia interpretation one would
analyze &amp;quot;leaf&amp;quot; as being in an ISA relationship with
&amp;quot;outgrowth&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;outgrowth&amp;quot; hasn&apos;t a suitable homogeneous
set of members and a better interpretation for modeling
this definition would be to consider the &amp;quot;outgrowth of&amp;quot;
phrase to signify a part/whole relationship between
&amp;quot;leaf&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;plant&amp;quot;.
Hence we may consider the dictionary to have at least
two taxonomic relationships (i.e. ISA and ISPART) as
well as additional relations explaining noun terminals
as verb arguments. One can also readily see that there
will be taxonomic interactions among nodes connected
across these relationship &amp;quot;bridges&amp;quot;.
While the parts of a plant will include the &amp;quot;leaves&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;stem&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;roots&amp;quot;, etc., the corresponding parts of any
TYPE of plant may have further specifications added to
their descriptions. Thus &amp;quot;plant&amp;quot; specifies a functional
form which can be further elaborated by descent down its
ISA chain. For example, a &amp;quot;frond&amp;quot; is a type of &amp;quot;leaf&amp;quot;,
frond - a usu, large divided leaf (as of a fern)
We knew from &amp;quot;leaf&amp;quot; that it was a normal outgrowth of a
&amp;quot;plant&amp;quot;, but now we see that &amp;quot;leaf&amp;quot; can be specialized,
provided we get confirmation from the dictionary that a
&amp;quot;fern&amp;quot; is a &amp;quot;plant&amp;quot;. (Such confirmation is only needed
if we grant &amp;quot;leaf&amp;quot; more than one sense meaning, but
words in the Pocket Dictionary do typically average 2-3
sense meanings). The definition of &amp;quot;fern&amp;quot; gives us the
needed linkage, offering,
interaction of the PART-OF and ISA hierarchies.
Historically even Raphael [17] used a PART-OF
relationship together with the ISA hierarchy of SIR&apos;s
deduction system. What however is new is that I am not
stating &amp;quot;leaf&amp;quot; is a part of a plant because of some need
use this fact within a particular system&apos;s operation.
but &amp;quot;discovering&amp;quot; this in a published reference source
and noting that such information results naturally from
an effort to assemble the complete lexical structure of
the dictionary.

<bodyText confidence="0.999985428571428">
As mentioned in Section 2.3, the use of &amp;quot;outgrowth&amp;quot; in
the definition of &amp;quot;leaf&amp;quot; causes problems in the taxonomy
if we treat &amp;quot;outgrowth&amp;quot; as the true genus term of that
definition. This word is but one example of a broad
range of noun terminals which may be described as
&amp;quot;partitives&amp;quot;. A &amp;quot;partitive&amp;quot; may be defined as a noun
which serves as a general term for a PART of another
large and often very non-homogeneous set of concepts.
Additionally. at the opposite end of the partitive
scale, there is the class of &amp;quot;collectives&amp;quot;. Collectives
are words which serve as a general term for a COLLECTION
of other concepts.
The disambiguators often faced decisions as to whether
some words were indeed the true semantic kernels of
definitions, and often found additional words in the
definitions which were more semantically appropriate to
serve as the kernel -- albeit they did not appear
syntactically in the correct position. Many of these
terms were partitives and collectives. Figure 7 shows a
set of partitives and collectives which were extracted
and classified by Gretchen Hazard and John White during
the dictionary project. The terms under &amp;quot;group names&amp;quot;.
&amp;quot;whole units&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;system units&amp;quot; are collectives.
Those under &amp;quot;individuators&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;piece units&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;space
shapes&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;existential units&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;locus units&amp;quot;. and &amp;quot;event
units&amp;quot; are partitives. These terms usually appeared in
the syntactic frame &amp;quot;An of&amp;quot; and this
additionally served to indicate their functional role.

<abstract confidence="0.909619290726817">The definition texts of a machine-readable pocket dictionary were analyzed to determine the disambiguated word sense of the kernel terms of each word sense being defined. The resultant sets of word pairs of defined and defining words were then computationally connected into two taxonomic semilattices (&amp;quot;tangled hierarchies&amp;quot;) representing some 24,000 noun nodes and 11,000 verb nodes. The study of the nature of the &amp;quot;topmost&amp;quot; nodes in these hierarchies. and the structure of the trees reveal information about the nature of the dictionary&apos;s organization of the language, the concept of semantic primitives and other aspects of lexical semantics. The data proves that the dictionary offers a fundamentally consistent description of word meaning and may provide the basis for future research and applications in computational linguistic systems. In the late 1960&apos;s, John Olney et al. at System Development Corporation produced machine-readable copies the Merriam-WebsterNRK Dictionaryand the Seventh golleziate Dictionary.These massive data files have been widely distributed within the computational linguistic cammunity, yet research upon the basic structure of the dictionary has been exceedingly slow and difficult due to the Significant computer resources required to process tens of thousands of definitions. The dictionary is a fascinating computational resource. It contains spelling, pronunciation, hyphenation, capitalization, usage notes for semantic domains. geographic regions, and propriety; etymological. syntactic and semantic information about the most basic units of the language. Accompanying definitions are example sentences which often use words in prototypical contexts. Thus the dictionary should be able to serve as a resource for a variety of computational linguistic needs. My primary concern within the dictionary has been the development of dictionary data for use in understanding systems. Thus I am concerned with what dictionary definitions tell us about the semantic and pragmatic structure of meaning. The hypothesis I am proposing is that definitions in the lexicon can be studied in the same manner as other large collections of objects such as plants, animals, and minerals are studied. Thus I am. concerned with enumerating the classificational organization of the lexicon as it has been implicitly used by the dictionary&apos;s lexicographers. Each textual definition in the dictionary is syntactically a noun or verb phrase with one or more kernel terms. If one identifies these kernel terms of definitions, and then proceeds to disambiguate them relative to the senses offered in the same dictionary under their respective definitions, then one can arrive at a large collection of pairs of disambiguated words which can be assembled into a taxonomic semi-lattice. This task has been accomplished for all the definition texts of nouns and verbs in a common pocket dictionary. This paper is an effort to reveal the results of a preliminary examination of the structure of these databases. The applications of this data are still in the future. What might these applications be? First, the data should provide information on the contents of semantic domains. One should be able to determine from a lexical taxonomy what domains one might be in given one has encountered the word &amp;quot;periscope&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;petiole&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;petroleum&amp;quot;. Second, dictionary data should be of use in resolving semantic ambiguity in text. Words in definitions appear in the company of their prototypical associates. Third, dictionary data can provide the basis for creating case grammar descriptions of verbs. and noun argument descriptions of nouns. Semantic templates of meaning are far richer when one considers the taxonomic inheritance of elements of the lexicon. Fourth. the dictionary should offer a classification . which anthropological linguists and psycholinguists can use as an objective reference in comparison with other cultures or human memory observations. This isn&apos;t to say that the dictionary&apos;s classification is the same as the culture&apos;s or the human mind&apos;s, only that it is an objective datum from which comparisons can be made. Fifth. knowledge of how the dictionary is structured can be used by lexicographers to build better dictionaries. And finally, the dictionary if converted into a computer tool can become more readily accessible to all the disciplines seeking to use the current paper-based versions. Education, historical linguistics. sociology. English composition. etc. can make given that they can assume access to a dictionary is immediately available via computer. I do not know what all these applications will be and the task at hand is simply an elucidation of the dictionary&apos;s structure as it currently exists. RIERARCRIES NOUNSAKRE= The grant. 14CS77-01315, &amp;quot;Development of a Computational Methodology for Deriving Natural Language Semantic Structures via Analysis of Machine-Readable Dictionaries&amp;quot;, created a taxonomy for the nouns and of the Pocket Dictionary(MPD), based upon the hand-disambiguated kernel words in their definitions. This taxonomy confirmed the anticipated structure of the lexicon to be that of a &amp;quot;tangled hierarchy&amp;quot; (8,9) of unprecedented size (24,000 noun senses. 11.000 verb senses). This data base is believed to be the first to be assembled which is representative of the structure of the entire English lexicon. (A somewhat similar study of the Italian lexicon has been done (2.111). The content categories agree substantially with the semantic structure of the lexicon proposed by Nide [151, and the verb taxonomy confirms primitives proposed by the San Diego LNR group This &amp;quot;tangled hierarchy&amp;quot; may be described as a formal data structure whose bottom is a set of terminal disambiguated words that are not used as kernel defining terms; these are the most specific elements in the structure. The tops of the structure are senses of words such as &amp;quot;cause&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;thing&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;class&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;being&amp;quot;, etc. These are the most general elements in the tangled hierarchy. If all the top terms are considered to be 133 members of the metaclass &amp;quot;&lt;word-sense&gt;&amp;quot;, the tangled forest becomes a tangled tree. The terminal nodes of such trees are in general each connected to the top in a lattice. An individual lattice can be resolved into a set of &amp;quot;traces&amp;quot;, each of which describes an alternate path from terminal to top. In a trace, each element implies the terms above it, and specifies the sense of the elements it. The collection of lattices forms a transitive acyclic digraph (or perhaps more clearly, a &amp;quot;semi-lattice&amp;quot;, that is, a lattice with a greatest upper bound, &lt;word-sense&gt;, but no least lower bound). If we specify all the traces composing such a structure, spanning all paths from top to bottom. we have topologically specified the upon these measurements. For example. &amp;quot;g&amp;quot; has the most single-level descendants, 3, yet it is neither at the top of the tangled hierarchy, nor does it have the highest total number of descendants. The root node &amp;quot;a&amp;quot; is at the top of the hierarchy, yet it only has 1 single-level descendant. For nodes to be considered of major importance in a tangled hierarchy it is thus necessary to consider not only their total number of descendants, but whether these descendants are all actually immediately under some other node to which this higher node is attached. As we shall see, the nodes which have the most single-level descendants are actually more pivotal concepts in some cases. Turning to the actual forest of tangled hierarchies, Table 2 gives the frequencies of the size and depth of semi-lattice. Thus the list on the left in Figure 1 the largest noun hierarchies and Table 3 gives the sizes alone for verb hierarchies (depths were not computed for these, unfortunately). topologically specifies the right. tangled hierarchy on its Table 2.

Relations between Topmost Tangled Verb Hierarchy Nodes The list appears in terms of descending frequency. The topmost nodes don&apos;t have many descendants at one level below, but they each have one BIG descendant, the next node in the chain. CAUSE-2.0A has approximately 240 direct descendants, and MAKE-1.1A has 480 direct descendants making these two the topmost nodes in terms of number of direct descendants, though they are ranked 9th and 13th in terms of total descendants (under words such as RE(AIN-.4A, CONTINUE-.1A, etc.). This points out in practice what the abstract tree of Figure 1 showed as possible in theory, and explains the seeming contradiction in having a basic verb such as &amp;quot;CAUSE-2.0A&amp;quot; defined in terms of a lesser verb such as &amp;quot;REMAIN-.4a&amp;quot;. The difficulty is explainable given two facts. First. the lexicographers HAD to define CAUSE-2.0A using some other verb, etc. This is inherent in the lexicon being used to define itself. Second, once one reaches the top of a tangled hierarchy one cannot go any higher -and consequently forcing further definitions for basic verbs such as &amp;quot;be&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;cause&amp;quot; invariably leads to using more specific verbs, rather than more general ones. The situation is neither erroneous, nor inconsistent in the context of a self-defined closed system and will be discussed further in the section on noun primitives. 2.2 NOUN PRIMITIVES One phenomenon which was anticipated in computationally grown trees was the existence of loops. Loops are caused by having sequences of interrelated definitions whose kernels form a ring-like array (5.201. However, what was not anticipated was how important such clusters of nodes would be both to the underlying basis for the taxonomies and as primitives of the language. Such circularity is sometimes evidence of a truly primitive concept, such as the set containing the words CLASS, GROUP, TYPE, KIND, SET. DIVISION, CATEGORY, SPECIES, INDIVIDUAL, GROUP/NG, PART and SECTION. To understand this, consider the subset of interrelated senses these words share (Figure 3) and then the graphic representation of these in Figure 4. 1.0A a number of individualsrelated by a common factor (as physical association. community of interests, or blood) 1.1A a groupof the same general status or nature 3.5A a groupof persons or things of the same kind or having a common characteristic usu. classed together 1.1A a aroupof persons or things that have similar characteristics 1.1B - .1A - KIND .1B a taxonomic groupcomprising closely related organisms potentially able to breed with one another Key: The definition of an MPD run-on, taken from Collegiate Dictionaryto supplement the set.

It is based upon the notion of definition given by Wilder [211, which in turn was based upon a presentation of the ideas of Padoa, a turn-of-the-century logician. definitions are given, the disambiguation kernel&apos;s senses leads to a cyclic structure which cannot be resolved by attributing erroneous judgements to either the lexicographer or the disambiguator; therefore structure as representative of an undefinable primitive concept, and the words whose definitions participate in this complex structure are found to be undefinable without reference to the other members of the set of undefined terms. The question of what to do with such primitives is not really a problem. as Winograd notes [221, once one realizes that they must exist at some level, just as mathematical primitives must exist. In tree construction the solution is to form a single node whose English surface representation may be selected from any of the words in the primitive set. There probably are connotative differences between the members of the set. but the ordinary pocket dictionary does not treat these its definitions with any detail. The Dictionarydoes include so-called &amp;quot;synonym paragraphs&amp;quot; which seem to discuss the connotative differences between words sharing a &amp;quot;ring&amp;quot;. While numerous studies of lexical domains such as the verbs of motion [1.12,131 and possession [101 have been carried out by other researchers, it is worth noting that recourse to using ordinary dictionary definitions as a source of material has received little attention. Yet the &amp;quot;primitives&amp;quot; selected by Donald A. Norman, David E. Rumelhart, and the LNR Research Group for knowledge representation in their system bear a to those verbs used most often as in MerriamWebster Pocket Dictionaryand Donald Sherman has shown (Table 4) these topmost verbs the most common verbs in the Collegiate Dictionary as well [191. The most frequent verbs of the MPD are, in descending order. MAKE, BE. BECOME, CAUSE. MOVE, TAKE, PUT, FORM, BRING, HAVE. GO. The of these verbs to those selected by the group for their semantic representations, i.e., BECOME. CAUSE. CHANGE, DO, MOVE. POSS (&amp;quot;have&amp;quot;), TRANSF (&amp;quot;give&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;take&amp;quot;), etc., [10.14.181 is striking. This similarity is indicative of an underlying &amp;quot;rightness&amp;quot; of dictionary definitions and supports the proposition that the lexical information extractable from study of the dictionary will prove to be the same knowledge needed for computational linguistics. The enumeration of the primitives for nouns and verbs by analysis of the tangled hierarchies of the noun and verb forests grown from the MPD definitions is a considerable undertaking and one which goes beyond the scope of this To example of how this technique works in practice, consider the discovery of the primitive group starting from PLACE-1.3A. a buildingor localityused for a special purpose The kernels of this definition are &amp;quot;building&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;locality&amp;quot;. Looking these up in turn we have: a usu. roofed and walled (as a house) for permanent use a particular situationor location Table 4. 50 Most Frequent Verb Infinitive Forms of W7 Verb Definitions (from [191).</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.97775071257485">This gives us four new terms, &amp;quot;structure&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;spot&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;situation&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;location&amp;quot;. Looking these up we find the circularity forming the primitive group. somethingbuilt (as a house or a dam) - LOCATION,lin - PLACE lite And finally, the only new term we encounter is &amp;quot;site&amp;quot; which yields, jocation‹* of a building&gt; (battle *&gt; The primitive cluster thus appears as in Figure 5. something (built) structure-.2a building-.1a site-1.3a ------&gt; site-.0a I situation-.1a I I T\ \\ I locality-.0a location-.2a place-1.3a &lt; Figure 5. Diagram of Primitive Set Containing PLACE, LOCALITY, SPOT, SITE, SITUATION, and LOCATION 2.3 NOUNS TERMINATING IN RELATIONS TO OTHER NOUNS OR VERBS In addition to terminating in &amp;quot;dictionary circles&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;loops&amp;quot;, nouns also terminate in definitions which are actually text descriptions of case arguments of verbs or relationships to other nouns. &amp;quot;Vehicle&amp;quot; is a fine 136 example of the former, being as it were the canonical instrumental case argument of one sense of the verb &amp;quot;carry&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;transport&amp;quot;. vehicle a means of carrying or transporting something &amp;quot;Leaf&amp;quot; is an example of the latter, being defined as a part of a plant, leaf a usu. flat and green outgrowth of a plant stem that is a unit of foliage and functions esp. in photosynthesis. Thus &amp;quot;leaf&amp;quot; isn&apos;t a type of anything. Even though under a strictly genus/differentia interpretation one would analyze &amp;quot;leaf&amp;quot; as being in an ISA relationship with &amp;quot;outgrowth&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;outgrowth&amp;quot; hasn&apos;t a suitable homogeneous set of members and a better interpretation for modeling definition would consider the &amp;quot;outgrowth of&amp;quot; phrase to signify a part/whole relationship between &amp;quot;leaf&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;plant&amp;quot;. Hence we may consider the dictionary to have at least two taxonomic relationships (i.e. ISA and ISPART) as well as additional relations explaining noun terminals as verb arguments. One can also readily see that there will be taxonomic interactions among nodes connected across these relationship &amp;quot;bridges&amp;quot;. While the parts of a plant will include the &amp;quot;leaves&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;stem&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;roots&amp;quot;, etc., the corresponding parts of any TYPE of plant may have further specifications added to their descriptions. Thus &amp;quot;plant&amp;quot; specifies a functional form which can be further elaborated by descent down its ISA chain. For example, a &amp;quot;frond&amp;quot; is a type of &amp;quot;leaf&amp;quot;, frond a usu, large divided leaf (as of a fern) We knew from &amp;quot;leaf&amp;quot; that it was a normal outgrowth of a &amp;quot;plant&amp;quot;, but now we see that &amp;quot;leaf&amp;quot; can be specialized, provided we get confirmation from the dictionary that a &amp;quot;fern&amp;quot; is a &amp;quot;plant&amp;quot;. (Such confirmation is only needed if we grant &amp;quot;leaf&amp;quot; more than one sense meaning, but words in the Pocket Dictionary do typically average 2-3 sense meanings). The definition of &amp;quot;fern&amp;quot; gives us the needed linkage, offering, interaction of the PART-OF and ISA hierarchies. Historically even Raphael [17] used a PART-OF relationship together with the ISA hierarchy of SIR&apos;s deduction system. What however is new is that I am not stating &amp;quot;leaf&amp;quot; is a part of a plant because of some need this a particular system&apos;s operation. but &amp;quot;discovering&amp;quot; this in a published reference source and noting that such information results naturally from an effort to assemble the complete lexical structure of the dictionary. 2.4 PARTITIVES AND COLLECTIVES As mentioned in Section 2.3, the use of &amp;quot;outgrowth&amp;quot; in the definition of &amp;quot;leaf&amp;quot; causes problems in the taxonomy if we treat &amp;quot;outgrowth&amp;quot; as the true genus term of that definition. This word is but one example of a broad of noun terminals which may as &amp;quot;partitives&amp;quot;. A &amp;quot;partitive&amp;quot; may be defined as a noun which serves as a general term for a PART of another large and often very non-homogeneous set of concepts. Additionally. at the opposite end of the partitive scale, there is the class of &amp;quot;collectives&amp;quot;. Collectives are words which serve as a general term for a COLLECTION of other concepts. The disambiguators often faced decisions as to whether some words were indeed the true semantic kernels of definitions, and often found additional words in the definitions which were more semantically appropriate to serve as the kernel -albeit they did not appear syntactically in the correct position. Many of these terms were partitives and collectives. Figure 7 shows a set of partitives and collectives which were extracted and classified by Gretchen Hazard and John White during the dictionary project. The terms under &amp;quot;group names&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;whole units&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;system units&amp;quot; are collectives. Those under &amp;quot;individuators&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;piece units&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;space shapes&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;existential units&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;locus units&amp;quot;. and &amp;quot;event units&amp;quot; are partitives. These terms usually appeared in the syntactic frame &amp;quot;An of&amp;quot; and this additionally served to indicate their functional role. 1 QUANTIFIERS 3 EXISTENTIAL UNITS fern any of a group of flowerless seedless vascular green plants Thus we have a specialized name for the &amp;quot;leaf&amp;quot; appendage of a &amp;quot;plant&amp;quot; if that plant is a &amp;quot;fern&amp;quot;.

For example, a &amp;quot;frond&amp;quot; is a type of &amp;quot;leaf&amp;quot;, frond - a usu, large divided leaf (as of a fern) We knew from &amp;quot;leaf&amp;quot; that it was a normal outgrowth of a &amp;quot;plant&amp;quot;, but now we see that &amp;quot;leaf&amp;quot; can be specialized, provided we get confirmation from the dictionary that a &amp;quot;fern&amp;quot; is a &amp;quot;plant&amp;quot;. (Such confirmation is only needed if we grant &amp;quot;leaf&amp;quot; more than one sense meaning, but words in the Pocket Dictionary do typically average 2-3 sense meanings). The definition of &amp;quot;fern&amp;quot; gives us the needed linkage, offering, interaction of the PART-OF and ISA hierarchies. Historically even Raphael [17] used a PART-OF relationship together with the ISA hierarchy of SIR&apos;s deduction system. What however is new is that I am not stating &amp;quot;leaf&amp;quot; is a part of a plant because of some need use this fact within a particular system&apos;s operation. but &amp;quot;discovering&amp;quot; this in a published reference source and noting that such information results naturally from an effort to assemble the complete lexical structure of the dictionary. 2.4 PARTITIVES AND COLLECTIVES As mentioned in Section 2.3, the use of &amp;quot;outgrowth&amp;quot; in the definition of &amp;quot;leaf&amp;quot; causes problems in the taxonomy if we treat &amp;quot;outgrowth&amp;quot; as the true ge</context>
