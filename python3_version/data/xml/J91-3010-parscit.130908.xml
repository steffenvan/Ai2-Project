How do you judge whether to read a book? You look at the front and back cover, the
name of the author, the table of contents, the bibliography, and some formal aspects,
such as layout. If you have the time, you read some pages to get a taste. Doing all
this with Allan Ramsay&apos;s book will give you a good basis for your decision. From
the back cover you will learn that &amp;quot;recent work in formal semantics has provided
analyses of a number of isolated phenomena. The present work shows what it is like
to integrate these fragments into a single unified treatment. The book presents a set of
syntactic-semantic rules which build up a description of the logical content of English
sentences on the basis of the logical contents of their components. These rules, which
are the heart of the book, give an account of a substantial fragment of English.&amp;quot;
Allan Ramsay is a professor of Artificial Intelligence at University College Dublin
and in the past has done work in parsing (Ramsay 1985), formal methods in Al (Ram-
say 1988), and in feature logic (Ramsay 1990).
From the table of contents we learn that the book is organized into six chapters
and comes with an additional preface, an epilogue, a bibliography, an appendix listing
all the &amp;quot;Rules and Frames&amp;quot; introduced in the book, and an index. The bibliography
consists of 63 very diverse entries, including the landmarks in the respective fields:
from Koskenniemi on morphology to Searle on speech acts. It also contains a good
number of entries on different aspects of logic, which gives you a warning that this
book focuses on the formal aspects of language.
The layout of the book is pleasant. The examples are numbered in a clear manner.
Syntactic and semantic structure listings are all framed in boxes and thus contrasted
from the text. Spelling and syntactical errors are few in number. When browsing
through the book, one is immediately struck by the amount of structure displays. On
200 pages Ramsay has 75 Frames and 20 Rule structures and countless more auxiliary
structures. This results in bothersome reading, since the notation is not comprehen-
sible on first sight. Especially reading Chapter 4 reminded me of reading sparsely
annotated C code rather than narrative text.
So what is in the book? Chapter 1 is an easy-to-read introduction to the task at
hand: formalizing a fragment of English. It briefly explains the prerequisites of compo-
sitionality and computational representation that underlie the work. Some examples
illustrate the difficulties of formalizing natural language in an intuitive way. Chap-
ters 2 through 5 are the heart of the book. They are of about equal length. Chapters 2
and 3 introduce the semantic and the syntactic frameworks used for the formaliza-
tion. Chapter 4 tries to integrate semantic and syntactic aspects into a whole, whereas
Chapter 5 points to the limits of this approach and to an extension using thematic
roles. Chapter 6 is a brief tribute to discourse and speech act considerations.

Chapter 2, &amp;quot;Semantic Framework,&amp;quot; elaborates the language for formalizing seman-
tic aspects of natural language. The semantic aspects consist of propositions and prop-
erties. The language chosen by Ramsay is an extension of first-order predicate logic
and is called property theory. In particular, he introduces an operator for abstraction
or, as he calls it, objectification. Property theory is supplied with a &amp;quot;Game-theoretic
semantics.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;The basic objects that underlie our semantics are going to be not sets
of sentences, not sets of possible worlds, but games. ... It is a game in which you
argue with yourself about some proposition. You win if you show that you can de-
fend the proposition in question against all possible attacks&amp;quot; (p. 31). This is a less
known approach to semantics, which, according to Ramsay, dates back to Lorenz
(1961) and Lorenzen (1959). He chose this approach because it incorporates a treat-
ment of knowledge and belief that is supposedly superior to possible worlds semantics.
I found this choice interesting and thought-provoking, but I could not find out how
this choice influenced the formalization later in the book. Chapter 2 ends with dis-
cussions about correctness (soundness and completeness) of the proposed language,
as well as some details of how to apply this language to the phenomena of mutual
knowledge, intensionality, commitments, discourse entities, and temporal relations.
The latter two strike me as being treated very briefly and superficially. It is a problem
throughout the book that, because of the variety of issues, many have been glossed
over.
Chapter 3, &amp;quot;Syntactic Framework,&amp;quot; elaborates the syntactic formalism. This for-
malism is in the tradition of unification-based theories. It borrows most notably from
HPSG. The Head Feature Convention and Foot Feature Principle are taken from GPSG.
The chapter starts with a formal definition of classification (of words), substitution,
unification, and rules. Ramsay then demonstrates how phrasal constituents such as
sentences, verb phrases, and noun phrases are represented. The notation is very sim-
ilar to HPSG, though macros are used to abbreviate frequently needed structures,
while the phon-feature from HPSG is missing here. Next, words and word classes are
discussed, with some detail on how suffixes contribute to the lexical information at-
tached to each word and word class. That is, a lexical lookup consists of unifying
the frames for the word class, the word, and the suffix. Finally, rules are introduced.
They are illustrated with examples for sentences and for complex noun phrases. In
particular, relative clauses are discussed at length, distinguishing five different types:
those in which the relative pronoun is the subject and those in which it is an object;
those without a relative pronoun; those without a relative pronoun and without the
auxiliary be; and appositive NPs or VPs that resemble relative clauses.
Chapter 4, &amp;quot;Basic Meaning,&amp;quot; tries to bridge the gap between the semantic and the
syntactic structures. Towards this goal every (syntactic) structure is annotated with
a feature &amp;quot;semantics,&amp;quot; which again is divided into presupposition and content. The
notion of presupposition is very simplistic: &amp;quot;The presupposition is some proposition
which the speaker believes that the hearer already believes&amp;quot; (p. 20). Thus for a sentence
such as Mary sold the cows, the presuppositions given (p. 144) are (roughly):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.99974">
• there exists a &amp;quot;salient&amp;quot; person named Mary, and
• there exists a &amp;quot;salient&amp;quot; subset of all cows.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99952">
However, we don&apos;t learn how one finds out about what is salient: &amp;quot;Characterizing
the circumstances in which some item is indeed salient.., is outside the scope of
the present work&amp;quot; (p. 112). Starting off with the semantic formalization of simple
sentences Ramsay then focuses on the formalization of auxiliaries, temporal aspects,
complex NPs, and coordination.

Chapter 5, &amp;quot;Roles and Structures,&amp;quot; advances the formalism by introducing states
and events. This is done by borrowing from Fillmore&apos;s notion of thematic roles that
distinguishes between surface subjects and semantic subjects. Thematic roles are ap-
plied to the phenomena of agentive and agent] ess verbs (e.g., kill vs. die) as well as
to passives, generics (bare plurals and habituals), sentential and verbal complements,
intensional objects, and free modifiers (prepositional and adverbial phrases).
Chapter 6, &amp;quot;Linguistic Action,&amp;quot; gives a brief overview of the relevance of taking
general behavior into account while formalizing natural language understanding. This
is done by showing parallels between AT planning theory and speech act theory to
the task at hand. The main idea is that (linguistic) actions consist of preconditions
and effects. Ramsay illustrates how this could be incorporated into his formalism by
showing how the actions of informing, nagging, and declaring differ with respect to
their preconditions and effects. The chapter concludes with a call for increasing the
formalization of mutual knowledge in future NLP systems. None of this is actually
implemented in Ramsay&apos;s system. His formalization stops at the single-sentence level,
and leaves contextual and extratextual considerations for further studies.
The above summary shows that this book tackles a wide variety of phenomena.
This results in the superficial treatment of most details as, for example, temporal
aspects (pp. 51, 127). In addition, when reading phrases such as &amp;quot;This looks as though
it is an empirical claim. ... As far as we are concerned it is simply a technical device&amp;quot;
(p. 64), or &amp;quot;We simply assume... without further worrying about...&amp;quot; (p. 127), I got
the uneasy feeling that pragmatic considerations of getting the job done were more
important than scientific rigor.
The main question left unanswered is &amp;quot;Whom is this book written for?&amp;quot; It is cer-
tainly not a textbook. It does not contain any exercises. It is also not meant to present
new results in the formalization of English. Nor is the implementation meant to be
applied in any particular NLP system. The book is simply a report on the formaliza-
tion of a variety of phenomena of English. As such, it may serve as a repository of
methods and results on how to treat these phenomena in a computational framework.
Unfortunately the obscure notation prevents a reader from using it as a lookup source
for individual phenomena. He or she must work through a substantial part of the
book to get used to the representation.
Ramsay offers a disk that contains the implementation of the rules introduced in
the book. The program is written in Quintus Prolog, and I had no problems running
the demo sentences on my Sun. The output of the program for these sentences is even
harder to read than the structure displays in the book. Unfortunately there is neither
program documentation nor any manual for the software.
