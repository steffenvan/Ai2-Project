BACKGROUND

<bodyText confidence="0.992048148148148">
The analysis of iteration and habituality in
this paper Is part of a comprehensive semantic
ehelysis of temporal expressions in natural
ianclueoe. The research on this topic is carried
out in the framework of EUROTRA, the MT project of
the Eeropean Community. It is reported on
P:tEnsively in Van Eynde (1R67).
The original motive for starting this research
an the fact that verbal tenses and temporal
as:xiliaries do not correspond one-to-one in the
languages that EUROTRA has to deal with. Compare

The model consists of a set of linearly orderec
irteryals.
An interval is a continuous set of time points
on the time axis :

This set might also be empty, as in

It is, furthermore, possipie to define some

wiii, for instance, be analyseo in a basic
proposition &amp;quot;toe cat sit on the mat&amp;quot; and the
information conveyed by the past tense.
Toe relation between both is established in two
steps : the basic proposition is first relateo to
the interval for which it is said to be true, the
socalled time of event (E), and then this interval
is related to the time of speech (S) :

This formula states that the cat sit on the mat&amp;quot;
is true at an interval E which precedes the time
of speech S.
Following Reichenbach (1947) I will furthermore
assume that the relation between the time of event
and the time of speech is mediated by a third kind
of interval, namely the time of reference (R), So,
instead of the simple Rel(E,S) we will have a
composite Rel(E,R) &amp; Rel(R,S).
Net to this relational information the
temporal expressions can also give specific
information about the location or the length of
the relevant intervals. This is typically done by
means of t:me adverbials, such as &amp;quot;next year, In
the spring&apos;, for two years&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;till Christmas&apos;,

of one-place predicates over intervals : Fred(E)

In the following part I will introduce an

Cyclic Iteration
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998539681818182">
Cyclic iteration is marked by adverbials like
&apos;daily&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;every Monday&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;each year&amp;quot;, etc. In
e.a. (1972) they are calleo periodic
frequency adverbials.
For the analysis of these advertials I first
introduce the notion frame time. The frame time is
the Interval which contains all the instances of
the evert described in the basic proposition. jr
Fer is true in a world w at an Interval

subintervals of i distributed throughout i

Stump 5 i-interval corresponds to my frame
time, and his non-overlapping subintervals
correspond to my I-intervals.
As a representation of (8: this formula is not
sufficient, though, since the instances of chess
plang do not have to take a whole week for (8,
tc be true. A more adequate paraphrase is to say
that every week contained at least one subinterval

Temporal Quantifiers
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999929636363636">
The format developed for the analysis of cyclic
iteration can also be used for the analysis of the
temporal quantifiers, such as &amp;quot;always&amp;quot;,
&apos;ecmetimes&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;never&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;seldom&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;often&amp;quot;. The
leformation tney provide is less specific than the
one peovided by the period frequency adverbials,
ene tnis should be reflected in tneir
representation.
As a starting point I take the general format
for the representation of sentences with a
periodic frequency adverbial :
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9457615">

tne instances for whicn &amp;quot;quadratic equations oe

all. Iris might indicate, by the way, tnat the 1-
oojects are not necessarily intervals, but rather
cases or occasions wnich can but neeo not be given
a temporal interpretation (cf. Lewis 1975).
The third condition concerns the properties of
tne 1-objects. In the case of the periodic
frequency adverbials the relevant properties
concern the location or the length of the
Interval. In the case of the temporal quantifiers
one could think of specifying a relevance

in Agyisi, Hoepelman I. Rohrer (1980) one can
rind a proposal to incorporate this information in
the semantic representation, but I will not abut
tnis proposal here, since the conditions on the

the relevant occasions (I) could just as well te

Or which he leaves for work as all occasions on
which he leaves for watching the home game of his

As a result of the foregoing reductions ano
changes the aeneral format for analysing temporal

In the previous parts I have presentee a
formalism for the representation of temporal

especially designed for the analysis of natural
language, but not for the analysis of any
particular natural language, such as English,
Dutch or Kiswahili.
Its main purpose is to provide a conceptuellv
well-definee language for defining and comparing
the meanings of temporal expressions in different
natural languages. In order to serve this purpose
it is not sufficient to heve a formalism, though.
Wnat is alsc needed is a general specification of

Hess concludes from these observations that the
quantifier of the subject is universal in (24) and
existential in s25-27). However, this conclusion
does not follow automatically. In terms of hthe
formalism presented in this paper one could sav
that 24) has an habitual interpretation, whereas
the other sentences have a non-Iterative
interpretation. In the former case the existential
quantifier of the subject will be in the scope of
tne Most-quantifier, whereas in the latter case it
will not be in the scope of any non-existential
quantifier, and this accounts for the difference
in interpretation without having to postulate two
possitle meanings for the indefinite article.
The reievente of the i+/-Habitualityl-
distinction hes so far only been demonstrated from
a monolincual semantic point of view. It is,
however, possible to give some translational
evidence for this oistinction as well.
Tre relevant cases are tne ones where the
corresoondino verb forms have different

The framework of the analysis is modeltheoretic semantics. BACKGROUND analysis of and habituality this paper Is part of a comprehensive semantic ehelysis of temporal expressions in natural ianclueoe. The research on this topic is carried out in the framework of EUROTRA, the MT project of Eeropean Community. It is P:tEnsively in Van Eynde (1R67). The original motive for starting this research an the fact that verbal tenses and temporal as:xiliaries do not correspond one-to-one in the languages that EUROTRA has to deal with.

This formula states that the cat sit on the mat&amp;quot; is true at an interval E which precedes the time of speech S. Following Reichenbach (1947) I will furthermore assume that the relation between the time of event and the time of speech is mediated by a third kind interval, namely the of reference So, instead of the simple Rel(E,S) we will have a composite Rel(E,R) &amp; Rel(R,S). Net to this relational information the temporal expressions can also give specific information about the location or the length of the relevant intervals. This is typically done by means of t:me adverbials, such as &amp;quot;next year, In spring&apos;, years&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;till Christmas&apos;, et:. This information will be represented by means of one-place predicates over intervals : Fred(E) &apos; and Fred(P).

In the following part I will introduce an e:;tehged formalism which can deal with these types of iteration.</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.981308653061225">Cyclic iteration is marked by adverbials like &amp;quot;every Monday&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;each year&amp;quot;, etc. In (1972) they are calleo frequency adverbials.

Tne chain-like structure or the representation format is, hence, linguistically motivated. The net question is whether the temporal quantifiers introduce any extra-conditions on ieterve Is, euch as eA,E), eIee and Temporal Quantifiers The format developed for the analysis of cyclic iteration can also be used for the analysis of the quantifiers, as &amp;quot;always&amp;quot;, &apos;ecmetimes&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;never&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;seldom&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;often&amp;quot;. The leformation tney provide is less specific than the one peovided by the period frequency adverbials, ene tnis should be reflected in tneir representation.

Iris might indicate, by the way, tnat the 1oojects are not necessarily intervals, but rather can but neeo not be given a temporal interpretation (cf. Lewis 1975). The third condition concerns the properties of tne 1-objects. In the case of the periodic frequency adverbials the relevant properties concern the location or the length of the Interval. In the case of the temporal quantifiers one could think of specifying a relevance conalticn, for a sentence like he was always late GDES not mean that he was late at any possible occasion in the past, but rather that he was late occasions on which his being late or timely coLld have mattered. in Agyisi, Hoepelman I.

As a result of the foregoing reductions ano changes the aeneral format for analysing temporal ouantifiers looks as follows : 3 R,E [Rel(R,S) &amp; Pred(R) &amp; Rel(E,R) &amp; Pred;E; &amp; I Cc(I,E) ---&gt;/&amp; 3 e Ece,l) &amp; Mke) &amp; AT(e,p)113 where Q is replaced by any of (V, 3, &apos;3, Most, Few, Many} M is replaced by some time adverbial wnich specifies tne location or the length of e (if there is any Habituality sentences discusset so far all contain explicit indication of iteration. The presence of such an indication is, however, not necessary for deriving an iterative interpretation. Take, for instance, (IQ: he leaves at twelve Tis sentence cannot only mean tnat he will leave at twelve, but also that he has the habit of leaving at tweive. In the representation of the former interpretation the time adverbial &amp;quot;at twelve&apos; specifies the time of reference : 3 R,E (J.(R,S) &amp; at twelve(R; &amp; E,R; &amp; the representation of the interpretation, on tam other hand, the time advertial shoulo be taken to specify the multiple for sentence 00.E.S not on one of leay:age at Out ratner on several of such leevee.

The first are unequivocallv Cehabitua13, the second E-habitual3 and the last will be given the feature [4.f-habitual].

In practice there are some oisambiguating though. Pasic proposition (p) denotes a state, then the sentence can not have an habitual interpretation. Compare The Meanings of the Verb Forms In the previous parts I have presentee a formalism for the representation of temporal information in sentences. Tnis formalism is especially designed for the analysis of natural language, but not for the analysis of any language, such as English, Dutch or Kiswahili. Its main purpose is to provide a conceptuellv well-definee language for defining and comparing the meanings of temporal expressions in different natural languages. In order to serve this purpose it is not sufficient to heve a formalism, though. Wnat is alsc needed is a general specification of now the semantic representations relate tc tneir language specific counterearts, 1.c. tne tenses, the temporal aexliaries and tne time advertials. former two will furtner ce called forms. For English those verb forms are summec up in tee following re:e )1=, re leaves at twelve Verb form ---&gt; 1+1-Fast] (willeinf) ee is in jail car be interpreted as meaning that he has tne naoit of leaving at twelve, but (21) cannot be interpret ed as meaning that he has the habit of being in jail. 2, 0ertain verb forms can block the derivation of one of the two possiole interpretations.

In terms of hthe formalism presented in this paper one could sav an habitual interpretation, whereas the other sentences have a non-Iterative interpretation. In the former case the existential quantifier of the subject will be in the scope of tne Most-quantifier, whereas in the latter case it will not be in the scope of any non-existential quantifier, and this accounts for the difference in interpretation without having to postulate two possitle meanings for the indefinite article. reievente of the i+/-Habitualityldistinction hes so far only been demonstrated from a monolincual semantic point of view.
