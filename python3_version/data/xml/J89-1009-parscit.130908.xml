several potential mechanisms that might be used in
these cases, such as focusing (Sidner 1979), or prefer-
ence semantics (Wilks 1975), but none of them were
implemented.
Unfortunately, although early semantic analysis is an
intuitively plausible approach, and Mellish explores it
thoroughly, there are basic questions about its general-
ity and extensibility that are left unanswered. For
example, the system is unable to handle some very
central aspects of language, such as negation (&amp;quot;The
ends of the string are not fixed&amp;quot;) and generic reference
(&amp;quot;A string has two ends&amp;quot;). These problems arise from a
basic assumption in this system that noun phrases have
specific referents, and the system falls short when this
assumption is not met. If these problems are inevitable
consequences of early semantic analysis, then it is hard
to see how early semantic analysis could be used in a
realistic system. Mellish owes the reader a discussion of
these issues and not just a statement that handling them
would require a major revision.
Another disappointment is that there is no attempt to
integrate work done in the paradigm of focusing and
centering (Grosz 1977, Sidner 1979, Grosz et al. 1983)
with this approach. While this work may not have come
to the attention of Mellish while he was doing the
original work (1978-81), a detailed discussion of the
relevance of the focusing work to his work would have
been immensely valuable in the present volume. For
example, the notion of focusing (or the related concept
of centering (Grosz et al. 1983) can provide constraints
on referents (as suggested by Rich and Luper-Foy 1987)
and may be able to do some of the work that Mellish
assigns to domain-specific reasoning. Typically, work in
the focusing and centering paradigms has not been
concerned to any great extent with the role of domain-
specific reasoning. Because of this, an integration of
these two approaches would have been very valuable.
It would also have been interesting to see a discus-
sion of the pros and cons of using techniques like
focusing versus domain-specific reasoning in cases
where either could do the job. The exploration of early
semantic analysis would also have been much more
valuable if Mellish had spent more time discussing the
implications of this work for future work in computa-
tional linguistics. Does he believe that the shortcomings
in coverage that he points out mean that this work is just
an interesting blind alley? Are there parts of the work
that provide insights that should be used in future
systems? Discussions of these questions would have
been very helpful.
Mellish is refreshingly clear and explicit about the
limitations of his work. There is also a very useful and
detailed discussion of some relatively unexplored types
of noun phrases. For example, the program described
here has good coverage of some interesting types of
plural noun phrases, such as specific plurals with indef-
inite cardinality. An example of this is &amp;quot;Small blocks,
each of mass m, are clamped at the ends and at the
center of a light rod&amp;quot;. I am not aware of any other work
that addresses the problems of handling these kinds of
noun phrases to this extent.
This book contains some detailed information about
the program, including algorithms, actual code, and
traces of execution, which are very useful for under-
standing what is going on.

In this book, I take some steps toward providing a system-
atic framework within which to understand . . . ways of
characterizing mind and action in terms of intention. . . . I
am guided by a simple, but, I think, powerful idea. Our
commonsense conception of intention is inextricably tied
to the phenomena of plan and planning.
