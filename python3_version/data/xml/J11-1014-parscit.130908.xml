1. Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999947181818182">
Our reviewing practices today are failing. With the number of ACL submissions steadily
growing over the last several years (for example, ACL 2009 had a 24% increase in sub-
missions over ACL 2008), the need for more reviewers has become more pronounced.
However, qualified reviewers are becoming hard to find, and when they are found,
they are often hard-pressed for time. As a result, slipshod reviews are becoming com-
monplace. Allowing this situation to continue as before will result in the deterioration
of our ability to recognize excellence in our research. An ‘intervention’ is therefore
needed.
As I see it, there are two distinct problems to tackle: first, a lack of qualified
reviewers, and second, a lack of quality control in reviews. After discussing these, I
will suggest some solutions that I believe are worth implementing.

2. Problems with Reviewing
2.1 The Lack of Qualified Reviewers
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995909466666667">
In an earlier Last Words piece, Ken Church (Church 2006) pointed out how the ACL
conference reviewing process can be derailed by the lack of positive endorsement by
reviewers who are not well qualified to review a given paper. He went on to suggest
that papers rejected by NAACL are “often strong contenders for the best-paper award
at ACL.” An instance of this phenomenon was observed in 2009, when a paper rejected
from NAACL 2009 with an average acceptance score of 2.3 out of 5 was given a best
paper award at ACL 2009 (Branavan et al. 2009).1
It is especially hard to find qualified reviewers these days partly because compu-
tational linguistics has become increasingly specialized. Papers in fields like parsing
and machine translation involve very technical modifications to a few current models.
Reviewers for such areas need to be ‘insiders’, well-versed in the latest developments in
the sub-area. This need is likely to become more pronounced as the specialization trend
continues.
Reviewers are currently selected based on informal social networks. Unfortunately,
most researchers do not have an extensive set of names of reviewers at hand, and relying

on personal connections (not to mention memories of reviewers’ prior performance)
is limiting and could bias the selection of reviewers to those who share a particular
point-of-view. This lack of information as to whom to contact can result in woefully
inappropriate selections of reviewers.

2.2 The Lack of Quality Control
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999843">
Even when qualified reviewers can be found, reviews are often hurried. At the 2009 ACL
Business Meeting, Ido Dagan pointed to the growing dissatisfaction with the quality of
conference reviewing, adding that the problems seemed to be exacerbated by increasing
the number of reviewers. The lack of quality is in part due to the large number of
conferences that compete for the reviewer’s time. As Fortnow (2009) observes, in the
case of computer science conferences the intensive time commitment required for re-
viewing makes it less likely that more experienced researchers will sign on as reviewers.
Such hurried reviewing and decision-making can result in a preference for safe, more
incremental papers rather than those that develop new models and research directions
(Fortnow 2009).

3. Finding Qualified Reviewers: An ACL Reviewer Database
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999918142857143">
To encourage better selection of reviewers, improved information management is
needed in terms of keeping track of reviewer background and areas of expertise. This
goal can be achieved by maintaining an ACL database of reviewer profiles that is accessible
to the public, as a resource for use in selecting reviewers. It would work as follows:
Whenever reviews are produced in an ACL-related forum, the Program Chair or Editor
would be responsible for updating the database (assisted in part by the conference or
journal management software). S/he would record the reviewer’s name and affiliation,
the name and type of forum (conference, workshop, journal, etc.), its time and place, the
number of papers reviewed, and the reviewer’s areas of interest. To protect a reviewer’s
privacy, information as to which papers were assigned to the reviewer should not be
revealed. Note that most conferences already publish a list of reviewers involved, so
this is not a huge step beyond what is there today.
Once created, the ACL Reviewer Database would provide for easier selection of
reviewers, and would allow a forum organizer or editor to determine, at least semi-
automatically, categories of reviewers such as specialist/generalist, prolific/occasional,
and skill level (e.g., journal paper vs. workshop reviewing, senior vs. extended program
committee experience).
Many reviewers work extremely hard at their reviews. Being recognized as a
well-respected reviewer is well worth striving for, and ideally, this reputation would
be reflected in part by one’s reviewing profile. Just as the impacts of journals and
authors are measured based on citations, there is no reason why reviewers should
not be assessed in terms of their impacts in guiding and encouraging computational
linguistics. Specifically, the database can be used to track how many journal and
conference articles a person has reviewed, and how many articles were submitted
to those venues. A reviewer’s impact factor can be computed by dividing the for-
mer by the latter, and including some normalization parameters (such as taking into
account the level of publishing activity in the particular computational linguistics
subfield).

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.977993">
4.1 Open Peer Review: Signing and Publication History
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999962733333333">
Reviewers often get away with slipshod, low-quality reviews because they can hide
under the cloak of anonymity. Other research communities have reduced the level of
anonymity by using open peer review. In an open peer-review system, reviewers may
sometimes become known to the paper authors, and in some instances, reviewers and
the content of their reviews may become known to all the readers as well. Journals that
have successfully deployed open peer-review include Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics
(ACP),2 the British Medical Journal (BMJ),3 and all forty-one of the Biomed Central (BMC)
medical journals.4
Open peer-review systems can differ in terms of reviewer transparency: Some
venues (e.g., the BMJ, and BMC medical journals such as BMC Cancer) always require
that reviews be signed, that is, visible to the author, whereas others do not (e.g., the
ACP journal), or else they leave it up to the reviewer. Signed reviews can considerably
raise the stakes on review quality: It is one thing to palm off a hurried review on a
hapless author, quite another to be accountable in front of all one’s colleagues for the
poor quality of one’s review. Although it is theoretically possible that signed reviews
might be less frank, in order to avoid alienating particular authors, such a problem
tends not to occur in practice. In the case of a randomized trial with medical articles
in the BMJ, signing did not lower the review quality or recommendations (van Rooyen
et al. 1999). Nor has the presence of signed reviews in journals that have used them led
to a rise in litigation against those journals. Finally, many journals using signed reviews,
such as BMC Cancer, continue to thrive and flourish.
Whereas the BMJ publishes only the final version of the paper, both the BMC med-
ical journals and the ACP journal provide public access to the publication history, namely,
all previous versions of the paper along with their reviews and author responses.5 A
view of such a publication history can be extremely instructive to both prospective
authors and reviewers. A further advantage of publication history is that prior submis-
sions within the community can be tracked, providing a collective memory of reviewers’
comments. That is far better than the situation today, where regular reviewers can often
recall reviewing some version of a paper earlier for some other forum, but may not be
able to recall the individual recommendations.

4.2 Reviewer Training
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9990596">
Reviewing is one of the most important activities a researcher carries out, and yet no
formal training is provided to reviewers. If we require high-quality reviews, we need
to train reviewers as to the best practices in reviewing as carried out by a particular
ACL-related forum. This could be organized as an on-line course specific to the journal
or conference, which every reviewer for that forum should take. The course, even if

involving only self-study, can be viewed as a more stringent requirement than simply
being encouraged to read, as is customary today, the reviewing guidelines. Here, too,
the conference or journal management software can check that the course has been
completed within the last couple of years before allowing the reviewer to proceed. The
course can be updated from time to time.
As an example, journals like the BMJ offer materials for training reviewers.6 These
materials include PowerPoint presentations on reviewing best practices (“What we
know about peer review,” “What editors want”) and written exercises (reading and
assessing three referee reports for a paper, and comparing the assessments with the
editor’s critique of those reports, as well as doing a practice review of a paper and
comparing it with the published reviews). As shown in a BMJ study of the effectiveness
of these materials (Schroter et al. 2004), trained reviewers detected significantly more
major errors in papers than those who weren’t trained.
For computational linguistics journals and conferences, it would be straightfor-
ward, under either an open peer review system and/or with permission of authors and
reviewers, to collect published reviews of several articles and have potential reviewers
go through a similar exercise to that provided by the BMJ. In particular, one could focus
on practice reviews for a paper. In addition to such on-line courses, improved review
quality can be engendered by discussion of reviewing methods in classroom settings,
particularly in seminar courses where papers have to be read and jointly discussed.

5. Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999943166666667">
To discover qualified reviewers, I have suggested creating an ACL Reviewer Database.
To improve review quality, I have advocated more use of open peer review, with review
signing and/or maintaining a history of the publication of each article, as well as specific
measures for improved reviewer training. These methods for improving review quality
have become common practice in some other fields, and it is high time computational
linguists started to explore them.
These improvements will require a higher degree of transparency than has been
customary in computational linguistics reviewing, but this transparency will reap con-
siderable benefits in further recognizing and promoting excellence in our research. It
would therefore be worthwhile to initiate a discussion group or a workshop to plan a
pilot that will try out some of these methods. Over time, it will also be useful to conduct
studies of how effective these methods are.
