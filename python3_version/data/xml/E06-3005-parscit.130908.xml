<bodyText confidence="0.9999938">
In the current project, we aim at
developing an approach for automatically
answering why-questions. We created a
data collection for research, development
and evaluation of a method for
automatically answering why-questions
(why-QA) The resulting collection
comprises 395 why-questions. For each
question, the source document and one or
two user-formulated answers are
available in the data set. The resulting
data set is of importance for our research
and it will contribute to and stimulate
other research in the field of why-QA.
We developed a question analysis
method for why-questions, based on
syntactic categorization and answer type
determination. The quality of the output
of this module is promising for future
development of our method for why-QA.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999788">
Until now, research in the field of automatic
question answering (QA) has focused on factoid
(closed-class) questions like who, what, where
and when questions. Results reported for the QA
track of the Text Retrieval Conference (TREC)
show that these types of wh-questions can be
handled rather successfully (Voorhees 2003).
In the current project, we aim at developing an
approach for automatically answering why-
questions. So far, why-questions have largely
been ignored by researchers in the QA field. One
reason for this is that the frequency of why-
questions in a QA context is lower than that of
other questions like who- and what-questions
(Hovy et al., 2002a). However, although why-
questions are less frequent than some types of
factoids (who, what and where), their frequency
is not negligible: in a QA context, they comprise
about 5 percent of all wh-questions (Hovy, 2001;
Jijkoun, 2005) and they do have relevance in QA
applications (Maybury, 2002). A second reason
for ignoring why-questions until now, is that it
has been suggested that the techniques that have
proven to be successful in QA for closed-class
questions are not suitable for questions that
expect a procedural answer rather than a noun
phrase (Kupiec, 1999). The current paper aims to
find out whether the suggestion is true that
factoid-QA techniques are not suitable for why-
QA. We want to investigate whether principled
syntactic parsing can make QA for why-
questions feasible.
In the present paper, we report on the work that
has been carried out until now. More
specifically, sections 2 and 3 describe the
approach taken to data collection and question
analysis and the results that were obtained. Then,
in section 4, we discuss the plans and goals for
the work that will be carried out in the remainder
of the project.

2 Data for why-QA
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999877736842105">
In research in the field of QA, data sources of
questions and answers play an important role.
Appropriate data collections are necessary for the
development and evaluation of QA systems
(Voorhees, 2000). While in the context of the
QA track of TREC data collections in support of
factoid questions have been created, so far, no
resources have been created for why-QA. For the
purpose of the present research therefore, we
have developed a data collection comprising a
set of questions and corresponding answers. In
doing so, we have extended the time tested
procedures previously developed in the TREC
context.
In this section, we describe the requirements
that a data set must meet to be appropriate for
development and we discuss a number of
existing sources of why-questions. Then we
describe the method employed for data collection
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999924694444444">
and the main characteristics of the resulting data
set.
The first requirement for an appropriate data set
concerns the nature of the questions. In the
context of the current research, a why-question is
defined as an interrogative sentence in which the
interrogative adverb why (or one of its
synonyms) occurs in (near) initial position. We
consider the subset of why-questions that could
be posed in a QA context and for which the
answer is known to be present in the related
document set. This means that the data set should
only comprise why-questions for which the
answer can be found in a fixed collection of
documents. Secondly, the data set should not
only contain questions, but also the
corresponding answers and source documents.
The answer to a why-question is a clause or
sentence (or a small number of coherent
sentences) that answers the question without
giving supplementary context. The answer is not
literally present in the source document, but can
be deduced from it. For example, a possible
answer to the question Why are 4300 additional
teachers required?, based on the source snippet
The school population is due to rise by 74,000,
which would require recruitment of an additional
4,300 teachers, is Because the school population
is due to rise by a further 74,000.
Finally, the size of the data set should be large
enough to cover all relevant variation that occur
in why-questions in a QA context.
There are a number of existing sources of
why-questions that we may consider for use in
our research. However, for various reasons, none
of these appear suitable.
Why-questions from corpora like the British
National Corpus (BNC, 2002), in which
questions typically occur in spoken dialogues,
are not suitable because the answers are not
structurally available with the questions, or they
are not extractable from a document that has
been linked to the question. The same holds for
the data collected for the Webclopedia project
(Hovy et al., 2002a), in which neither the
answers nor the source documents were
included. One could also consider questions and
answers from frequently asked questions (FAQ)
pages, like the large data set collected by
Valentin Jijkoun (Jijkoun, 2005). However, in
FAQ lists, there is no clear distinction between
the answer itself (a clause that answers the
question) and the source document that contains
the answer.
The questions in the test collections from the
TREC-QA track do contain links to the possible
answers and the corresponding source
documents. However, these collections contain
too few why-questions to qualify as a data set
that is appropriate for developing why-QA.
Given the lack of available data that match our
requirements, a new data set for QA research
into why-questions had to be compiled. In order
to meet the given requirements, it would be best
to collect questions posed in an operational QA
environment, like the compilers of the TREC-
QA test collections did: they extracted factoid
and definition questions from search logs
donated by Microsoft and AOL (TREC, 2003).
Since we do not have access to comparable
sources, it was decided to revert to the procedure
used in earlier TRECs, and imitate a QA
environment in an elicitation experiment. We
extended the conventional procedure by
collecting user-formulated answers in order to
investigate the range of possible answers to each
question. We also added paraphrases of collected
questions in order to extend the syntactic and
lexical variation in the data collection.
In the elicitation experiment, ten native
speakers of English were asked to read five texts
from Reuters’ Textline Global News (1989) and
five texts from The Guardian on CD-ROM
(1992). The texts were around 500 words each.
The experiment was conducted over the Internet,
using a web form and some CGI scripts. In order
to have good control over the experiment, we
registered all participants and gave them a code
for logging in on the web site. Every time a
participant logged in, the first upcoming text that
he or she did not yet finish was presented. The
participant was asked to formulate one to six
why-questions for this text, and to formulate an
answer to each of these questions. The
participants were explicitly told that it was
essential that the answers to their questions could
be found in the text. After submitting the form,
the participant was presented the questions posed
by one of the other participants and he or she was
asked to formulate an answer to these questions
too. The collected data was saved in text format,
grouped per participant and per source
document, so that the source information is
available for each question. The answers have
been linked to the questions.
In this experiment, 395 questions and 769
corresponding answers were collected. The
number of answers would have been twice the
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999979857142857">
number of questions if all participants would
have been able to answer all questions that were
posed by another participant. However, for 21
questions (5.3%), the second participant was not
able to answer the first participant’s question.
Note that not every question in the elicitation
data set has a unique topic1: on average, 38
questions were formulated per text, covering
around twenty topics per text.
The collected questions have been formulated
by people who had constant access to the source
text. As a result of that, the chosen formulations
often resemble the original text, both in the use
of vocabulary and sentence structure. In order to
expand the dataset, a second elicitation
experiment was set up, in which five participants
from the first experiment were asked to
paraphrase some of the original why-questions.
The 166 unique questions were randomly
selected from the original data set. The
participants formulated 211 paraphrases in total
for these questions. This means that some
questions have more than one paraphrase. The
paraphrases were saved in a text file that includes
the corresponding original questions and the
corresponding source documents.
We studied the types of variation that occur
among questions covering the same topic. First,
we collected the types of variation that occur in
the original data set and then we compared these
to the variation types that occur in the set of
paraphrases.
In the original data set, the following types of
variation occur between different questions on
the same topic:
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.789601">
Lexical variation, e.g.

Verb tense variation, e.g.
have risen vs. have been rising;
Optional constituents variation, e.g.
class sizes vs. class sizes in
England and Wales;
Sentence structure variation, e.g.

In the set of paraphrases, the same types of
variation occur, but as expected the differences
between the paraphrases and the source

which P is the topic.
sentences are slightly bigger than the differences
between the original questions and the source
sentences. We measured the lexical overlap
between the questions and the source texts as the
number of content words that are in both the
question and the source text. The average relative
lexical overlap (the number of overlapping words
divided by the total number of words in the
question) between original questions and source
text is 0.35; the average relative lexical overlap
between paraphrases and source text is 0.31.
The size of the resulting collection (395 original
questions, 769 answers, and 211 paraphrases of
questions) is large enough to initiate serious
research into the development of why-QA.
Our collection meets the requirements that
were formulated with regard to the nature of the
questions and the presence of the answers and
source documents for every question.

3 Question analysis for why-QA
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999838774193548">
The goal of question analysis is to create a
representation of the user’s information need.
The result of question analysis is a query that
contains all information about the answer that
can be extracted from the question. So far, no
question analysis procedures have been created
for why-QA specifically. Therefore, we have
developed an approach for proper analysis of
why-questions. Our approach is based on existing
methods of analysis of factoid questions. This
will allow us to verify whether methods used in
handling factoid questions are suitable for use
with procedural questions. In this section, we
describe the components of successful methods
for the analysis of factoid questions. Then we
present the method that we used for the analysis
of why-questions and indicate the quality of our
method.
The first (and most simple) component in current
methods for question analysis is keyword
extraction. Lexical items in the question give
information on the topic of the user’s
information need. In keyword selection, several
different approaches may be followed. Moldovan
et al. (2000), for instance, select as keywords all
named entities that were recognized as proper
nouns. In almost all approaches to keyword
extraction, syntax plays a role. Shallow parsing
is used for extracting noun phrases, which are
considered to be relevant key phrases in the
retrieval step. Based on the query’s keywords,
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.996639">
41
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999973393939394">
one or more documents or paragraphs can be
retrieved that may possibly contain the answer.
A second, very important, component in
question analysis is determination of the
question’s semantic answer type. The answer
type of a question defines the type of answer that
the system should look for. Often-cited work on
question analysis has been done by Moldovan et
al. (1999, 2000), Hovy et al. (2001), and Ferret et
al. (2002). They all describe question analysis
methods that classify questions with respect to
their answer type. In their systems for factoid-
QA, the answer type is generally deduced
directly from the question word (who, when,
where, etc.): who leads to the answer type
person; where leads to the answer type place,
etc. This information helps the system in the
search for candidate answers to the question.
Hovy et al. find that, of the question analysis
components used by their system, the
determination of the semantic answer type makes
by far the largest contribution to the performance
of the entire QA system.
For determining the answer type, syntactic
analysis may play a role. When implementing a
syntactic analysis module in a working QA
system, the analysis has to be performed fully
automatically. This may lead to concessions with
regard to either the degree of detail or the quality
of the analysis. Ferret et al. implement a
syntactic analysis component based on shallow
parsing. Their syntactic analysis module yields a
syntactic category for each input question. In
their system, a syntactic category is a specific
syntactic pattern, such as ‘WhatDoNP’ (e.g.
What does a defibrillator do?) or
‘WhenBePNborn’ (e.g. When was Rosa Park
born?). They define 80 syntactic categories like
these. Each input question is parsed by a shallow
parser and hand-written rules are applied for
determining the syntactic category. Ferret et al.
find that the syntactic pattern helps in
determining the semantic answer type (e.g.
company, person, date). They unfortunately do
not describe how they created the mapping
between syntactic categories and answer types.
As explained above, determination of the
semantic answer type is the most important task
of existing question analysis methods. Therefore,
the goal of our question analysis method is to
predict the answer type of why-questions.
In the work of Moldovan et al. (2000), all
why-questions share the single answer type
reason. However, we believe that it is necessary
to split this answer type into sub-types, because a
more specific answer type helps the system
select potential answer sentences or paragraphs.
The idea behind this is that every sub-type has its
own lexical and syntactic cues in a source text.
Based on the classification of adverbial
clauses by Quirk (1985:15.45), we distinguish
the following sub-types of reason: cause,
motivation, circumstance (which combines
reason with conditionality), and purpose.
Below, an example of each of these answer
types is given.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.744383" genericHeader="method">
Cause:
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.914345">
The flowers got dry because it
hadn’t rained in a month.
Motivation:
I water the flowers because I
don’t like to see them dry.
Circumstance:
Seeing that it is only three,
we should be able to finish
this today.
Purpose:
People have eyebrows to prevent
sweat running into their eyes.
The why-questions that correspond to the reason
clauses above are respectively Why did the
flowers get dry?, Why do you water the flowers?,
Why should we be able to finish this today?, and
Why do people have eyebrows?. It is not always
possible to assign one of the four answer sub-
types to a why-question. We will come back to
this later.
Often, the question gives information on the
expected answer type. For example, compare the
two questions below:
Why did McDonald&apos;s write Mr.
Bocuse a letter?
Why have class sizes risen?
Someone asking the former question expects as
an answer McDonald’s motivation for writing a
letter, whereas someone asking the latter
question expects the cause for rising class sizes
as answer.
The corresponding answer paragraphs do
indeed contain the equivalent answer sub-types:
McDonald&apos;s has acknowledged
that a serious mistake was
made. &amp;quot;We have written to
apologise and we hope to reach

Lahaye, a spokeswoman for
McDonald&apos;s France, which
operates 193 restaurants.
Class sizes in schools in
England and Wales have risen
for the second year running,
according to figures released
today by the Council of Local
Education Authorities. The
figures indicate that although
the number of pupils in schools
has risen in the last year by
more than 46,000, the number of
teachers fell by 3,600.
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.966665529411765">
We aim at creating a question analysis module
that is able to predict the expected answer type of
an input question. In the analysis of factoid
questions, the question word often gives the
needed information on the expected answer type.
In case of why, the question word does not give
information on the answer type since all why-
questions have why as question word. This
means that other information from the question is
needed for determining the answer sub-type.
We decided to use Ferret’s approach, in which
syntactic categorization helps in determining the
expected answer type. In our question analysis
module, the TOSCA (TOols for Syntactic
Corpus Analysis) system (Oostdijk, 1996) is
explored for syntactic analysis. TOSCA’s
syntactic parser takes a sequence of
unambiguously tagged words and assigns
function and category information to all
constituents in the sentence. The parser yields
one or more possible output trees for (almost) all
input sentences. For the purpose of evaluating
the maximum contribution to a classification
method that can be obtained from a principled
syntactic analysis, the most plausible parse tree
from the parser’s output is selected manually.
For the next step of question analysis, we
created a set of hand-written rules, which are
applied to the parse tree in order to choose the
question’s syntactic category. We defined six
syntactic categories for this purpose:
Action questions, e.g.
Why did McDonald&apos;s write Mr.
Bocuse a letter?
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.469729">
Process questions, e.g.
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.987910089285714">
Why has Dixville grown famous
since 1964?
Intensive complementation questions, e.g.
Why is Microsoft Windows a
success?
Monotransitive have questions, e.g.
Why did compilers of the OED
have an easier time?
Existential there questions, e.g.
Why is there a debate about
class sizes?
Declarative layer questions, e.g.
Why does McDonald&apos;s spokeswoman
think the mistake was made?
The choice for these categories is based the
information that is available from the parser, and
the information that is needed for determining
the answer type.
For some categories, the question analysis
module only needs fairly simple cues for
choosing a category. For example, a main verb
with the feature intens leads to the category
‘intensive complementation question’ and the
presence of the word there with the syntactic
category EXT leads to the category ‘existential
there question’. For deciding on declarative layer
questions, action questions and process
questions, complementary lexical-semantic
information is needed. In order to decide whether
the question contains a declarative layer, the
module checks whether the main verb is in a list
that corresponds to the union of the verb classes
say and declare from Verbnet (Kipper et al.,
2000), and whether it has a clausal object. The
distinction between action and process questions
is made by looking up the main verb in a list of
process verbs. This list contains the 529 verbs
from the causative/inchoative alternation class
(verbs like melt and grow) from the Levin verb
index (Levin, 1993); in an intransitive context,
these verbs are process verbs.
We have not yet developed an approach for
passive questions.
Based on the syntactic category, the question
analysis module tries to determine the answer
type. Some of the syntactic categories lead
directly to an answer type. All process questions
with non-agentive subjects get the expected
answer type cause. All action questions with
agentive subjects get the answer type motivation.
We extracted information on agentive and non-
agentive nouns from WordNet: all nouns that are
in the lexicographer file noun.person were
selected as agentive.
Other syntactic categories need further analysis.
Questions with a declarative layer, for example,
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.999478">
43
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.997754580952381">
are ambiguous. The question Why did they say
that migration occurs? can be interpreted in two
ways: Why did they say it? or Why does
migration occur?. Before deciding on the answer
type, our question analysis module tries to find
out which of these two questions is supposed to
be answered. In other words: the module decides
which of the clauses has the question focus. This
decision is made on the basis of the semantics of
the declarative verb. If the declarative is a factive
verb – a verb that presupposes the truth of its
complements – like know, the module decides
that the main clause has the focus. The question
consequently gets the answer type motivation. In
case of a non-factive verb like think, the focus is
expected to be on the subordinate clause. In
order to predict the answer type of the question,
the subordinate clause is then treated the same
way as the complete question was. For example,
consider the question Why do the school councils
believe that class sizes will grow even more?.
Since the declarative (believe) is non-factive, the
question analysis module determines the answer
type for the subordinate clause (class sizes will
grow even more), which is cause, and assigns it
to the question as a whole.
Special attention is also paid to questions with a
modal auxiliary. Modal auxiliaries like can and
should, have an influence on the answer type.
For example, consider the questions below, in
which the only difference is the presence or
absence of the modal auxiliary can:
Why did McDonalds not use
actors to portray chefs in
amusing situations?
Why can McDonalds not use
actors to portray chefs in
amusing situations?
The former question expects a motivation as
answer, whereas the latter question expects a
cause. We implemented this difference in our
question analysis module: CAN (can, could) and
HAVE TO (have to, has to, had to) lead to the
answer type cause. Furthermore, the modal
auxiliary SHALL (shall, should) changes the
expected answer type to motivation.
When choosing an answer type, our question
analysis module follows a conservative policy: in
case of doubt, no answer type is assigned.
We did not yet perform a complete evaluation of
our question analysis module. For proper
evaluation of the module, we need a reference set
of questions and answers that is different from
the data set that we collected for development of
our system. Moreover, for evaluating the
relevance of our question analysis module for
answer retrieval, further development of our
approach is needed.
However, to have a general idea of the
performance of our method for answer type
determination, we compared the output of the
module to manual classifications. We performed
these reference classifications ourselves.
First, we manually classified 130 why-
questions from our development set with respect
to their syntactic category. Evaluation of the
syntactic categorization is straightforward: 95
percent of why-questions got assigned the correct
syntactic category using ‘perfect’ parse trees.
The erroneous classifications were due to
differences in the definitions of the specific verb
types. For example, argue is not in the list of
declarative verbs, as a result of which a question
with argue as main verb is classified as action
question instead of declarative layer question.
Also, die and cause are not in the list of process
verbs, so questions with either of these verbs as
main verb are labeled as action questions instead
of process questions.
Secondly, we performed a manual classification
into the four answer sub-types (cause,
motivation, circumstance and purpose). For this
classification, we used the same set of 130
questions as we did for the syntactic
categorization, combined with the corresponding
answers. Again, we performed this classification
ourselves.
During the manual classification, we assigned
the answer type cause to 23.3 percent of the
questions and motivation to 40.3 percent. We
were not able to assign an answer sub-type to the
remaining pairs (36.4 percent). These questions
are in the broader class reason and not in one of
the specific sub-classes None of the question-
answer pairs was classified as circumstance or
purpose. Descriptions of purpose are very rare in
news texts because of their generic character
(e.g. People have eyebrows to prevent sweat
running into their eyes). The answer type
circumstance, defined by Quirk (cf. section
15.45) as a combination of reason with
conditionality, is also rare as well as difficult to
recognize.
For evaluation of the question analysis
module, we mainly considered the questions that
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.997113">
44
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.975875723404256">
did get assigned a sub-type (motivation or cause)
in the manual classification. Our question
analysis module succeeded in assigning the
correct answer sub-type to 62.2 percent of these
questions, the wrong sub-type to 2.4 percent, and
no sub-type to the other 35.4 percent. The set of
questions that did not get a sub-type from our
question analysis module can be divided in four
groups:
(a) Action questions for which the subject was
incorrectly not marked as agentive (mostly
because it was an agentive organization like
McDonald’s, or a proper noun that was not in
WordNet’s list of nouns denoting persons, like
Henk Draijen);
(b) questions with an action verb as main verb
but a non-agentive subject (e.g. Why will
restrictions on abortion damage women&apos;s
health?);
(c) passive questions, for which we have not
yet developed an approach (e.g. Why was the
Supreme Court reopened?);
(d) Monotransitive have questions. This
category contains too few questions to formulate
a general rule.
Group (a), which is by far the largest of these
four (covering half of the questions without sub-
type), can be reduced by expanding the list of
agentive nouns, especially with names of
organizations. For groups (c) and (d), general
rules may possibly be created in a later stage.
With this knowledge, we are confident that we
can reduce the number of questions without sub-
type in the output of our question analysis
module.
These first results predict that it is possible to
reach a relatively high precision in answer type
determination. (Only 2 percent of questions got
assigned a wrong sub-type.) A high precision
makes the question analysis output useful and
reliable in the next steps of the question
answering process. On the other hand, it seems
difficult to get a high recall. In this test, only
62.2 percent of the questions that were assigned
an answer type in the reference set, was assigned
an answer type by the system – this is 39.6
percent of the total.

4 Conclusions and further research
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999896298245614">
We created a data collection for research into
why-questions and for development of a method
for why-QA. The collection comprises a
sufficient amount of why-questions. For each
question, the source document and one or two
user-formulated answers are available in the data
set. The resulting data set is of importance for
our research as well as other research in the field
of why-QA.
We developed a question analysis method for
why-questions, based on syntactic categorization
and answer type determination. In-depth
evaluation of this module will be performed in a
later stage, when the other parts of our QA
approach have been developed, and a test set has
been collected. We believe that the first test
results, which show a high precision and low
recall, are promising for future development of
our method for why-QA.
We think that, just as for factoid-QA, answer
type determination can play an important role in
question analysis for why-questions. Therefore,
Kupiec’ suggestion that conventional question
analysis techniques are not suitable for why-QA
can be made more precise by saying that these
methods may be useful for a (potentially small)
subset of why-questions. The issue of recall, both
for human and machine processing, needs further
analysis.
In the near future, our work will focus on
development of the next part of our approach for
why-QA.
Until now we have focused on the first of four
sub-tasks in QA, viz. (1) question analysis (2)
retrieval of candidate paragraphs; (3) paragraph
analysis and selection; and (4) answer
generation. Of the remaining three sub-tasks, we
will focus on paragraph analysis (3). In order to
clarify the relevance of the paragraph analysis
step, let us briefly discuss the QA-processes that
follows question analysis.
The retrieval module, which comes directly
after the question analysis module, uses the
output of the question analysis module for
finding candidate answer paragraphs (or
documents). Paragraph retrieval can be
straightforward: in existing approaches for
factoid-QA, candidate paragraphs are selected
based on keyword matching only. For the current
research, we do not aim at creating our own
paragraph selection technique.
More interesting than paragraph retrieval is
the next step of QA: paragraph analysis. The
paragraph analysis module tries to determine
whether the candidate paragraphs contain
potential answers. In case of who-questions,
noun phrases denoting persons are potential

answers; in case of why-questions, reasons are
potential answers. In the paragraph analysis
stage, our answer sub-types come into play. The
question analysis module determines the answer
type for the input question, which is motivation,
cause, purpose, or circumstance. The paragraph
analysis module uses this information for
searching candidate answers in a paragraph. As
has been said before, the procedure for assigning
the correct sub-type needs further investigation
in order to increase the coverage and the
contribution that answer sub-type classification
can make to the performance of why-question
answering.
Once the system has extracted potential
answers from one or more paragraphs with the
same topic as the question, the eventual answer
has to be delimited and reformulated if
necessary.

Results reported for the QA track of the Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) show that these types of wh-questions can be handled rather successfully (Voorhees 2003). In the current project, we aim at developing an approach for automatically answering whyquestions. So far, why-questions have largely been ignored by researchers in the QA field. One reason for this is that the frequency of whyquestions in a QA context is lower than that of other questions like who- and what-questions (Hovy et al., 2002a). However, although whyquestions are less frequent than some types of factoids (who, what and where), their frequency is not negligible: in a QA context, they comprise about 5 percent of all wh-questions (Hovy, 2001; Jijkoun, 2005) and they do have relevance in QA applications (Maybury, 2002). A second reason for ignoring why-questions until now, is that it has been suggested that the techniques that have proven to be successful in QA for closed-class questions are not suitable for questions that expect a procedural answer rather than a noun phrase (Kupiec, 1999).

There are a number of existing sources of why-questions that we may consider for use in our research. However, for various reasons, none of these appear suitable. Why-questions from corpora like the British National Corpus (BNC, 2002), in which questions typically occur in spoken dialogues, are not suitable because the answers are not structurally available with the questions, or they are not extractable from a document that has been linked to the question. The same holds for the data collected for the Webclopedia project (Hovy et al., 2002a), in which neither the answers nor the source documents were included. One could also consider questions and answers from frequently asked questions (FAQ) pages, like the large data set collected by Valentin Jijkoun (Jijkoun, 2005). However, in FAQ lists, there is no clear distinction between the answer itself (a clause that answers the question) and the source document that contains the answer. The questions in the test collections from the TREC-QA track do contain links to the possible answers and the corresponding source documents. However, these collections contain too few why-questions </context>

In order to decide whether the question contains a declarative layer, the module checks whether the main verb is in a list that corresponds to the union of the verb classes say and declare from Verbnet (Kipper et al., 2000), and whether it has a clausal object.

In this section, we describe the components of successful methods for the analysis of factoid questions. Then we present the method that we used for the analysis of why-questions and indicate the quality of our method. The first (and most simple) component in current methods for question analysis is keyword extraction. Lexical items in the question give information on the topic of the user’s information need. In keyword selection, several different approaches may be followed. Moldovan et al. (2000), for instance, select as keywords all named entities that were recognized as proper nouns. In almost all approaches to keyword extraction, syntax plays a role. Shallow parsing is used for extracting noun phrases, which are considered to be relevant key phrases in the retrieval step. Based on the query’s keywords, 41 one or more documents or paragraphs can be retrieved that may possibly contain the answer.

Ferret et al. find that the syntactic pattern helps in determining the semantic answer type (e.g. company, person, date). They unfortunately do not describe how they created the mapping between syntactic categories and answer types. As explained above, determination of the semantic answer type is the most important task of existing question analysis methods. Therefore, the goal of our question analysis method is to predict the answer type of why-questions. In the work of Moldovan et al. (2000), all why-questions share the single answer type reason. However, we believe that it is necessary to split this answer type into sub-types, because a more specific answer type helps the system select potential answer sentences or paragraphs. The idea behind this is that every sub-type has its own lexical and syntactic cues in a source text. Based on the classification of adverbial clauses by Quirk (1985:15.45), we distinguish the following sub-types of reason: cause, motivation, circumstance (which combines reason with conditionality), and purpose.

In the analysis of factoid questions, the question word often gives the needed information on the expected answer type. In case of why, the question word does not give information on the answer type since all whyquestions have why as question word. This means that other information from the question is needed for determining the answer sub-type. We decided to use Ferret’s approach, in which syntactic categorization helps in determining the expected answer type. In our question analysis module, the TOSCA (TOols for Syntactic Corpus Analysis) system (Oostdijk, 1996) is explored for syntactic analysis. TOSCA’s syntactic parser takes a sequence of unambiguously tagged words and assigns function and category information to all constituents in the sentence. The parser yields one or more possible output trees for (almost) all input sentences. For the purpose of evaluating the maximum contribution to a classification method that can be obtained from a principled syntactic analysis, the most plausible parse tree from the parser’s output is selected manually. For the next step of question analysis, we created a set of hand-written rules, which are applied to the</context>

We developed a question analysis method for why-questions, based on syntactic categorization and answer type determination. The quality of the output of this module is promising for future development of our method for why-QA. 1 Introduction Until now, research in the field of automatic question answering (QA) has focused on factoid (closed-class) questions like who, what, where and when questions. Results reported for the QA track of the Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) show that these types of wh-questions can be handled rather successfully (Voorhees 2003). In the current project, we aim at developing an approach for automatically answering whyquestions. So far, why-questions have largely been ignored by researchers in the QA field. One reason for this is that the frequency of whyquestions in a QA context is lower than that of other questions like who- and what-questions (Hovy et al., 2002a). However, although whyquestions are less frequent than some types of factoids (who, what and where), their frequency is not negligible: in a QA context, they comprise about 5 percent of all wh-questions (Hovy, 2001; Jijkoun, 2005) and they do have relevance</context>
