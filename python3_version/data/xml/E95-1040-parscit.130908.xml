In this paper we present a semantic
study of motion complexes (ie. of a mo-
tion verb followed by a spatial preposi-
tion). We focus on the spatial and the
temporal intrinsic semantic properties of
the motion verbs, on the one hand, and
of the spatial prepositions, on the other
hand. Then we address the problem of
combining these basic semantics in or-
der to formally and automatically de-
rive the spatiotemporal semantics of a
motion complex from the spatiotempo-
ral properties of its components.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999939527777778">
Most of natural languages provide two types of
lexical items to describe the motion of an entity
with respect to some location: motion verbs (to
run; to enter) and spatial prepositions (from;
towards). Motion verbs can be used directly with
a location, when they are transitive (to cross the
town) or with a spatial preposition, when they are
intransitive (to go through the town). The latter
case is more interesting: most of the French mo-
tion verbs are intransitive and the interaction be-
tween motion verbs and spatial prepositions gives
detailed informations about the way human bee-
ings mentally represent spatiotemporal aspects of
a motion. When we describe a motion, the fact
to choose a verb instead of another, a preposition
instead of another, a syntactic structure instead
of another, reveals our mental cognitive represen-
tation. We claim that natural languages can be
considered as a trace of these representations, in
which it is possible, with systematic and detailled
linguistic studies, to light up the way spatiotem-
poral properties are represented and on which ba-
sic concepts these representations lie. We present
such linguistic investigations on French motion
verbs and spatial prepositions and the basic con-
cepts we have found. We also address composi-
tional semantics for motion complexes (ie. a mo-
tion verb followed by a spatial preposition) and
show that the complexity and the refinements of
the linguistic studies presented just before are jus-
tified and required at the compositional level in
order to capture the different behaviours in the
compositional processes that exist with the French
language. We also compare with the English lan-
guage and draw some conclusions on the benefits
of our approach.

2 Lexical Semantics for Motion
Verbs
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998218">
Following Gruber (1965), Jackendoff (1976),
Boons (1985), we approach motion verbs in terms
of some &amp;quot;localist semantical&amp;quot; role labels. The lin-
guistic study of French intransitive motion verbs
(see eg. (Asher &amp; Sablayrolles, 1994a)) we have
realized has allowed the definition of an ontology
for, &amp;quot;location&amp;quot; in three basic concepts:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.983187333333333">
• locations which are concrete places (a room;
a house; a street);
• positions which are parts of a location (the
position where I am in this room);
• postures which are ways to be in a position
(to be standing, sitting, lying).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99964075">
With the help of this ontology we have realized
a typology for intransitive motion verbs. We dis-
tinguish 4 categories on the basis of which kind of
&amp;quot;location&amp;quot; they intrinsically refer to.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.962614642857143">
• Change of location (CoL) verbs (entrer-
to enter; sortir—to go out) denote a change
of location. When we enter some place or go
out of some place, we have different spatial
relation with the location (ie. inside/outside)
before and after the Motion.
• Change of position verbs (voyager—to
travel; courir—to run) denote a change of po-
sition. When we travel or run, we go from
some part to another part of a same global
location. Such verbs do not behave all homo-
geneously.
— Some denote a change of position which
always occur (voyager—to travel). For

example, we cannot say voyager sur
place—to travel in place. We call these
verbs change of position (CoPs)
verbs.
Others denote only possible change of
position (courir—to run). For example,
we can say courir sur place—to run
in place. We call these verbs inertial
change of position (ICoPs) verbs.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9259895">
• Change of posture (CoPtu) verbs
(s&apos;asseoir—to sit down; se baisser—to
bend down). They denote a change of the
relations between the parts of an entity.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999170740740741">
For the following, we will focus on CoL verbs
(the Change of Location verbs), mainly because
they are rich in spatiotemporal informations, but
also because we have at disposal exhaustive lists
of French CoL verbs. We have realized a system-
atic and fine linguistic study on these verbs, look-
ing carefully at each of them, one by one (and we
have 440 CoL verbs in French), in order to extract
their intrinsic spatiotemporal properties. These
semantic properties can be characterized by a re-
structuration of the space induced by the so-called
reference location (lref) (cf. (Talmy, 1983)).
This lref, implicitly suggested by each CoL verb,
can be either the initial location (as with part ir—
to leave; sortir—to go out), or the path (passer,
traverser—to pass through) or the final location
(arriver—to arrive; entrer—to enter) of the mo-
tion. Indeed, verbs like sortir intrinsically sug-
gest a location of which we have gone out. This
space, induced by the lref, is characterized by most
of the authors in the literature by a two-part spa-
tial system consisting in the inside and the outside
of the lref. We propose to refine this structure
with two new concepts, required to distinguish
minimal pairs like sort ir (to go out)/part ir (to
leave), and entrer (to enter)/atterir (to land).
These concepts are:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9744191">
1. a limit of proximity distinguishing an outside
of proximity from a far away outside; indeed,
if sort ir simply requires to go out of the lref,
partir in addition forces the mobile to go
sufficiently far away from that lref.
2. an external zone of contact required by verbs
like atterir for which the final location is
neither the lref (in contrast with entrer) or
the outside (or proximity outside) of the lref
(in contrast with s &apos;approcher—to approach).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.989374">
We have so defined a structuration of the space
based on 4 zones :
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.99968525">
• the inside;
• the external zone of contact;
• the outside of proximity;
• the far away outside.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999512538461539">
This structuration is close to the way Jackendoff
and Landau (1992) encode the space induced by
the reference object introduced by a static spatial
preposition. As we have come to these distinctions
by examining different linguistic material, we con-
clude that language structures space in the same
way whatever sort of lexical items (motion verbs
(dynamic)/(static) spatial prepositions) we exam-
ine. This has allowed us to classify CoL verbs into
10 classes on the basis of which zones the mobile
is inside, at the beginning and at the end of its
motion. Note that all the geometrical possibilities
are not lexicalized in French.

3 Lexical Semantics for Spatial
Prepositions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999516222222222">
We have followed the same approach with French
spatial prepositions, but using a structuration of
the space induced by the location introduced in
the PP by the preposition, and not induced by the
lref as for verbs. Following Laur (1993), we con-
sider simple prepositions (like in) as well as prepo-
sitional phrases (like in front of,. We have classi-
fied 199 such French prepositions into 16 groups
using in addition of our zones two other criteria:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.994007142857143">
• prepositions can be:
— positional (like in)
— directional (like into)
• directional prepositions can be:
— Initial (like from)
— Medial (like through)
— Final (like to)

depending if they focus on the initial location,
on the path or on the final location of the
motion.

4 Compositional Semantics for
Motion Complexes
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999946263157895">
The linguistic studies, used for the typologies of
CoL verbs and spatial prepositions, have been re-
alized on verbs considered without any adjuncts,
in their atemporal form and independently of any
context, on the one hand, and on prepositions
considered independently of any context, on the
other. This methodology, discussed in Borillo 8.6
Sablayrolles (1993), has allowed us to extract the
intrinsic semantics of these lexical items.
Since natural languages put together verbs and
prepositions in a sentence, we have developped
a formal calculus (see (Asher &amp; Sablayrolles,
1994b)), based on these two typologies, which
computes, in a compositional way, the spatiotem-
poral properties of a motion complex from the se-
mantic properties of the verb and of the prepo-
sition. For reason of space we cannot detail our
formalism here, but we intend to present it in the
talk.

<bodyText confidence="0.999978541666667">
The semantics of a motion complex is not
the simple addition of the semantics of its con-
stituents. On the contrary, it is the result of a
complex interaction between these properties. It
is often the case that from this interaction appear
new properties that belong neither to the verb or
the preposition. These new properties are only
the result of the interaction of the verb with the
preposition.
Let us consider for example the following VP:
sortir dans le jardin—to go out into the gar-
den. The verb sort jr—to go out implicitly sug-
gests an initial location; the preposition dans—
(which means in, but which is translated here by
into) is a positional preposition and, as so, only
denotes the static spatial relation inside. The lo-
cation le jardin—the garden is the final location
of the motion. This final information was con-
tained neither in the verb or in the preposition.
This information is the result of the interaction
of the verb sort jr—to go out with the preposition
dans—in/into.
Note that the combination for such items does
not behave the same in English, where the final
information is explicitly brought by the preposi-
tion into, which is a directional preposition, and
where this particular combination does not create
new information.
This shows the neccesity to take into account
such language specific behaviour in natural lan-
guages understanding systems and in natural lan-
guages machine translation. We formalize with
11 axioms in a non-monotonic first order logic the
behaviour of all possible kinds of verb-preposition
association for the French language. We use non-
monotonic logic in order to represent defeasible or
generic rules and also in order to encode defaults
about lexical entries.
These axioms are based on the lexical semantics
of CoL verbs and of spatial prepositions. They
also take into account the syntactic structure of
the sentence (we have supposed an X-bar syntax
with a VP internal subject, though this is not es-
sential) and the links which exist at the level of
discours between this sentence and the previous
and following sentences of the text. These links,
called discourse relations, are basic concepts on
which texts are structured (cf. (Asher, 1993)).

<bodyText confidence="0.999897461538461">
The study and the first results we have here pre-
sented cover from lexical semantics to discourse
structures, with strong interactions between these
two ends. Indeed, lexical informations can be used
to disambiguate the structure of the discours, as
well as discourse relations can be used to dis-
ambiguate lexical entries, as shown in (Asher &amp;
Sablayrolles, 1994b). Our work is based on sys-
tematic and very detailed linguistic studies which
lead to rather complex computations for calculat-
ing the spatiotemporal semantics of a motion com-
plex. But we have seen that this level of detail and
complexity is necessary if one want to understand,
to formalize and to compute a right spatiotempo-
ral semantics for motion complexes. We continue
Our investigations on two directions:
1. we compare our results with similar works
in course of realization on the Basquian lan-
guage (by Michel Aurnague) and on the
Japanese language (by Junichi Saito);
2. we use the results presented here for refin-
ing the notions of the Aktionsart, where the
structuration of the space in 4 zones can be
used to distinguish sub-classes inside the tra-
ditional well known classes of aspectual stud-
ies.

We have so defined a structuration of the space based on 4 zones : • the inside; • the external zone of contact; • the outside of proximity; • the far away outside. This structuration is close to the way Jackendoff and Landau (1992) encode the space induced by the reference object introduced by a static spatial preposition. As we have come to these distinctions by examining different linguistic material, we conclude that language structures space in the same way whatever sort of lexical items (motion verbs (dynamic)/(static) spatial prepositions) we examine. This has allowed us to classify CoL verbs into 10 classes on the basis of which zones the mobile is inside, at the beginning and at the end of its motion.

Following Laur (1993), we consider simple prepositions (like in) as well as prepositional phrases (like in front of,. We have classified 199 such French prepositions into 16 groups using in addition of our zones two other criteria: • prepositions can be: — positional (like in) — directional (like into) • directional prepositions can be: — Initial (like from) — Medial (like through) — Final (like to) depending if they focus on the initial location, on the path or on the final location of the motion. 4 Compositional Semantics for Motion Complexes The linguistic studies, used for the typologies of CoL verbs and spati</context>

For the following, we will focus on CoL verbs (the Change of Location verbs), mainly because they are rich in spatiotemporal informations, but also because we have at disposal exhaustive lists of French CoL verbs. We have realized a systematic and fine linguistic study on these verbs, looking carefully at each of them, one by one (and we have 440 CoL verbs in French), in order to extract their intrinsic spatiotemporal properties. These semantic properties can be characterized by a restructuration of the space induced by the so-called reference location (lref) (cf. (Talmy, 1983)). This lref, implicitly suggested by each CoL verb, can be either the initial location (as with part ir— to leave; sortir—to go out), or the path (passer, traverser—to pass through) or the final location (arriver—to arrive; entrer—to enter) of the motion. Indeed, verbs like sortir intrinsically suggest a location of which we have gone out. This space, induced by the lref, is characterized by most of the authors in the literature by a two-part spatial system consisting in the inside and the outside of the lref. We propose to refine this structure with two new concepts, required to distinguish </context>
