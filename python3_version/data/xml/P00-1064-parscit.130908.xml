We present a robust approach
for linking already existing lexi-
cal/semantic hierarchies. We used
a constraint satisfaction algorithm
(relaxation labeling) to select —
among a set of candidates— the node
in a target taxonomy that bests
matches each node in a source tax-
onomy. In particular, we use it to
map the nominal part of WordNet
1.5 onto WordNet 1.6, with a very
high precision and a very low re-
maining ambiguity.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.973729333333333">
There is an increasing need of having available
general, accurate and broad coverage multi-
lingual lexical/semantic resources for devel-
oping NL applications. Thus, a very active
field inside NL during the last years has been
the fast development of generic language re-
sources.
Several attempts have been performed to
connect already existing ontologies. In
(Ageno et al., 1994), a Spanish/English bilin-
gual dictionary is used to (semi)automatically
link Spanish and English taxonomies ex-
tracted from DGILE (Alvar, 1987) and LDOCE
(Procter, 1987). Similarly, a simple au-
tomatic approach for linking Spanish tax-
onomies extracted from DGILE to WordNet
(Miller et al., 1991) synsets is proposed in
(Rigau et al., 1995). The work reported in
(Knight and Luk, 1994) focuses on the con-
struction of Sensus, a large knowledge base
for supporting the Pangloss machine transla-
tion system. In (Okumura and Hovy, 1994)
(semi)automatic methods for associating a
Japanese lexicon to an English ontology us-
ing a bilingual dictionary are described. Sev-
eral experiments aligning EDR and Word-
Net ontologies are described in (Utiyama and
Hasida, 1997). Several lexical resources and
techniques are combined in (Atserias et al.,
1997) to map Spanish words from a bilingual
dictionary to WordNet, and in (Farreres et
al., 1998) the use of the taxonomic structure
derived from a monolingual MRD is proposed
as an aid to this mapping process.
The use of relaxation labeling algorithm
to attach substantial fragments of the Span-
ish taxonomy derived from DGILE (Rigau et
al., 1998) to the English WordNet using a
bilingual dictionary for connecting both hi-
erarchies, has been reported in (Daude et al.,
1999.)
In this paper we use the same technique to
map WN1.5 to wN1.6. The aim of the experi-
ment is twofold: First, show that the method
is general enough to link any pair of ontolo-
gies. Second, evaluate our taxonomy link-
ing procedure, by comparing our results with
other WN1.5 to WN1.6 existing mappings.
This paper is organized as follows: In sec-
tion 2 we describe the used technique (the
relaxation labeling algorithm) and its appli-
cation to hierarchy mapping. In section 3 we
describe the constraints used in the relaxation
process, and finally, after presenting some ex-
periments and results, we offer some conclu-
sions and outline further lines of research.
2 Application of Relaxation
Labeling to NLP
Relaxation labeling (Rt.) is a generic name for
a family of iterative algorithms which perform
function optimization, based on local infor-
mation. See (Torras, 1989) for a summary.
Its most remarkable feature is that it can deal
with any kind of constraints, thus, the model
can be improved by adding any constraints
available, and the algorithm is independent
of the complexity of the model. That is, we
can use more sophisticated constraints with-
out changing the algorithm.
The algorithm has been applied to Pos
tagging (Marquez and Padro, 1997), shallow
parsing (Voutilainen and Padro, 1997) and to
word sense disambiguation (Padro, 1998).
Although other function optimization al-
gorithms could have been used (e.g. ge-
netic algorithms, simulated annealing, etc.),
we found RL to be suitable to our purposes,
given its ability to use models based on con-
text constraints, and the existence of previous
work on applying it to NLP tasks.
Detailed explanation of the algorithm can
be found in (Torras, 1989), while its applica-
tion to NLP tasks, advantages and drawbacks
are addressed in (Padro, 1998).

2.1 Algorithm Description
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999855277777778">
The Relaxation Labeling algorithm deals with
a set of variables (which may represent words,
synsets, etc.), each of which may take one
among several different labels (Pos tags,
senses, MRD entries, etc.). There is also a
set of constraints which state compatibility
or incompatibility of a combination of pairs
variable—label.
The aim of the algorithm is to find a weight
assignment for each possible label for each
variable, such that (a) the weights for the
labels of the same variable add up to one,
and (b) the weight assignment satisfies —to
the maximum possible extent— the set of con-
straints.
Summarizing, the algorithm performs con-
straint satisfaction to solve a consistent label-
ing problem. The followed steps are:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9713551">
1. Start with a random weight assignment.
9. Compute the support value for each label
of each variable. Support is computed ac-
cording to the constraint set and to the
current weights for labels belonging to
context variables.
3. Increase the weights of the labels more
compatible with the context (larger sup-
port) and decrease those of the less com-
patible labels (smaller support). Weights
are changed proportionally to the sup-
port received from the context.
4. If a stopping/convergence criterion is sat-
isfied, stop, otherwise go to step 2. We
use the criterion of stopping when there
are no more changes, although more so-
phisticated heuristic procedures may also
be used to stop relaxation processes (Ek-
lundh and Rosenfeld, 1978; Richards et
al., 1981).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.980653666666667">
The cost of the algorithm is proportional to
the product of the number of variables by the
number of constraints.

2.2 Application to taxonomy
mapping
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999299125">
As described in previous sections, the problem
we are dealing with is to map two taxonomies.
In this particular case, we are interested in
mapping WN1.5 to WN1.6, that is, assign each
synset of the former to at least one synset of
the later.
The modeling of the problem is the follow-
ing:

• Each wN1.5 synset is a variable for the
relaxation algorithm. We will refer to it
as source synset and to wN1.5 as source
taxonomy.
• The possible labels for that variable are
all the wN1.6 synsets which contain a
word belonging to the source synset. We
will refer to them as target synsets and
to wN1.6 as target taxonomy.
• The algorithm will need constraints stat-

The average remaining ambiguity in
Princeton mapping and in the mapping per-
formed by the relaxation labeling algorithm is
shown respectively in columns SenseMap am-
biguity and RL ambiguity of table 4.
Our system proposes, in most cases, a
unique wN1.6 synset for each wN1.5 synset.
The average ranges from 1.001 to 1.007 pro-
posals per synset depending on the chosen
threshold, while the Princeton mapping has
an average of 1.007.
Summarizing, the obtained results point
that our system is able to produce a less am-
biguous assignment than SenseMap, with a
significantly higher accuracy and wider cov-
erage.
In addition, our system only uses structural
information (namely, hyper/hyponymy rela-
tionships) while SenseMap uses synset words,
glosses, and other information in WordNet.
On the one hand, when information other
than taxonomy structure is used results might
be even better. On the other hand, for cases
in which such information is not available
(e.g. further development of EuroWordNets
in new languages), structure may provide a
reliable basis.

We have applied the relaxation labeling al-
gorithm to assign an appropriate node in a
target taxonomy to each node in a source tax-
onomy, using only hyper/hyponymy informa-
tion.
Results on wN1.5 to wN1.6 mapping have
been reported. The high precision achieved
provides further evidence that this technique
-previously used in (Daude et al., 1999) to
link a Spanish taxonomy to wN1.5- consti-
tutes an accurate method to connect tax-
onomies, either for the same or different lan-
guages. Further extensions of this technique
to include information other than structural
may result in a valuable tool for those con-
cerned with the development and improve-
ment of large lexical or semantic ontologies.
The results obtained up to now seem to in-

onomies automatically extracted from a
Spanish MRD to WN1.5 (Daude et al.,
1999) show that the technique may be
useful even when both taxonomies belong
to different languages or have structures
less similar than in the case reported in
this paper.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.82543953125">
• The system produces a good assign-
ment for WN mapping, based only on
hyper/hyponymy relationships, which is
specially useful when no other informa-
tion is available (i.e. in the case of map-
ping the EuroWN hierarchies). The re-
maining ambiguity is low with a high ac-
curacy, and precision-recall tradeoff may
be controlled by adjusting the S thresh-
old.
Some issues to address for improving the al-
gorithm performance, and to exploit its pos-
sibilities are:
• Use other relationships than hy-
per/hyponymy as constraints to select
the best connection. Relationships as
sibling, cousin, etc. could be used. In
addition, WN provides other relation-
ships such as synonymy, meronymy,
etc. which could also provide useful
constraints.
• Use other available information, such as
synset words, glosses, etc. in the WN to
WN mapping task.
• Link the verbal, adjectival, and adverbial
parts of wN1.5 and wN1.6.
• Test the performance of the technique to
link other structures (e.g WN-EDR, WN-
LDOCE, dutch-wN, italian-wN,
• Use it to link taxonomies for new lan-
guages to EuroWordNet.
• Give a step beyond the source-to-target

vision, and map the taxonomies in a
symmetrical philosophy, that is, each
node of each taxonomy is assigned to
a node in the other taxonomy. This
should increase the coverage, and rein-
force/discard connections that may be
weak when assigned only in one direc-
tion. This could even open the doors to
many-to-many taxonomy mapping.

Increase the weights of the labels more compatible with the context (larger support) and decrease those of the less compatible labels (smaller support). Weights are changed proportionally to the support received from the context. 4. If a stopping/convergence criterion is satisfied, stop, otherwise go to step 2. We use the criterion of stopping when there are no more changes, although more sophisticated heuristic procedures may also be used to stop relaxation processes (Eklundh and Rosenfeld, 1978; Richards et al., 1981). The cost of the algorithm is proportional to the product of the number of variables by the number of constraints. 2.2 Application to taxonomy mapping As described in previous sections, the problem we are dealing with is to map two taxonomies. In this particular case, we are interested in mapping WN1.5 to WN1.6, that is, assign each synset of the former to at least one synset of the later. The modeling of the problem is the following: • Each wN1.5 synset is a variable for the relaxation algorithm. We will refer to it as source synset and to wN1.5 as source taxonomy. • </context>

This paper is organized as follows: In section 2 we describe the used technique (the relaxation labeling algorithm) and its application to hierarchy mapping. In section 3 we describe the constraints used in the relaxation process, and finally, after presenting some experiments and results, we offer some conclusions and outline further lines of research. 2 Application of Relaxation Labeling to NLP Relaxation labeling (Rt.) is a generic name for a family of iterative algorithms which perform function optimization, based on local information. See (Torras, 1989) for a summary. Its most remarkable feature is that it can deal with any kind of constraints, thus, the model can be improved by adding any constraints available, and the algorithm is independent of the complexity of the model. That is, we can use more sophisticated constraints without changing the algorithm. The algorithm has been applied to Pos tagging (Marquez and Padro, 1997), shallow parsing (Voutilainen and Padro, 1997) and to word sense disambiguation (Padro, 1998). Although other function optimization algorithms could have been used (e.g. genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, etc.),</context>
