Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999954235294118">
This demonstration will illustrate interac-
tive computer games intended to help a
native speaker of English learn Mandarin.
These systems provide users with human-
like conversational exercises with contex-
tualized help mechanisms. Two distinctly
different activities, a translation game and
a dialogue game are illustrated. The level
of difficulty can be manipulated, and the
sentence variations covered by the sys-
tems familiarize users with different ex-
pressions of the same meaning. The sys-
tems preserve the qualities of a typical
computer system, being infinitely patient
and available any time of day. Students
will be able to repeatedly practice conver-
sation with no embarrassment.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999246357142857">
Mandarin Chinese is one of the most difficult lan-
guages for a native English speaker to learn. Chi-
nese is substantially more difficult to master than
the traditional European languages currently being
taught in America – French, Spanish, German, etc.,
because of the lack of common roots in the vocab-
ulary, the novel tonal and writing systems, and the
distinctly different syntactic structure.
It is widely agreed among educators that the best
way to learn to speak a foreign language is to en-
gage in natural conversation with a native speaker of
the language. Yet this is also one of the most costly
ways to teach a language, due to the inherently one-
to-one student-teacher ratio that it implies.

Recent research in the Spoken Language Systems
group at MIT has focused on the idea of designing
entertaining computer games as a device for teach-
ing a foreign language, with initial emphasis on the
language pair, English and Mandarin. The games are
accessible at a Web page, and the student’s speech is
captured from a headset microphone to support nat-
ural spoken dialogue interaction. The system can
also be installed to run completely stand-alone on
the local laptop computer.

2 Demonstrated Systems
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99996395">
The demonstrated systems comprise two related ac-
tivities, the translation game and the dialogue game.
The translation game serves as preparation for the
dialogue game: the user acquires expertise in speak-
ing within the domain in the target language. The
system randomly presents sentences in English and
asks the student to speak a sentence of equivalent
meaning in Mandarin. To imitate the competitive
spirit of video games, the system offers ten difficulty
levels, which are automatically adjusted depending
on the student’s monitored performance. After ad-
vancing to the highest difficulty level, they will sub-
sequently be much better equipped to converse with
the system within the dialogue game.
The dialogue game involves spoken conversa-
tional interaction to solve a particular scenario. The
student and computer are tasked with jointly solv-
ing a specified goal. Differing difficulty levels are
achieved via the device of a robotic tutor who assists
the student in solving their side of the conversation.

able to internalize the structures of the target lan-
guage, and thus the vocabulary, grammar rules, and
pronunciation are practiced concurrently. The user
begins by translating isolated vocabulary items in
Level 1, advancing to phrases and full sentences at
higher levels. The most difficult level, Level 10, in-
volves long and complicated sentences.
We have implemented this game in two domains:
(1) flight reservations, and (2) hobbies and sched-
ules. Details of the translation procedure can be
found in (Wang and Seneff, 2006), and the algo-
rithm for assessment is described in detail in (Wang
and Seneff, 2006). The input utterance is processed
through the speech recognizer and language under-
standing (Seneff, 1992) components, to achieve a
simple encoding of its meaning. The system com-
pares this meaning representation to one automati-
cally derived from the targeted English equivalent.
The system then speaks a paraphrase of the user’s
hypothesized utterance in both Chinese and En-
glish (Baptist and Seneff, 2000). If it has determined
that the student was successful, it congratulates them
and prompts them with the next English sentence for
translation. At any time, the student can ask for as-
sistance, in which case the system will provide them
with a “correct” translation of the English utterance,
which they can then attempt to imitate.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998653">
2.2 Dialogue Game
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998">
In the dialogue game (Seneff, 2006), the user is
asked to solve a particular scenario, by role play-
ing a specified persona, which changes dynamically
every time the game is played. We will demonstrate
the dialogue game in the hobbies and schedules do-
main. The student is provided with a specification
of their preferences for participating in possible ac-
tivities (swimming, dancing, watching movies, etc.)
as well as a calendar specifying activities they are
planning to do in the next few days. They are tasked
with arranging with the computer to jointly partici-
pate in an activity that they both like, at a time when
both are free. Another option is for either party to
invite the other one to join them in an activity that is
already on their schedule.
In addition to the robotic dialogue partner, the stu-
dent is assisted in solving the task by a robotic tutor,
who helps them plan what to say next. The tutor
works with the same information that the student
has, and independently plans the student’s half of
the conversation. At each dialogue turn, it provides
a proposed response, based on the evolving dialogue
context. Five different difficulty levels have been
implemented, as follows:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.995421142857143">
1. Eavesdropping: The student can simply let the
tutor carry out their side of the conversation by
clicking a button to advance each dialogue turn.
2. Parroting: The system presents a proposed sen-
tence in pinyin on the screen, and the student
can just read it out loud well enough to be suc-
cessfully understood.
3. Translation: The system presents an English
sentence which the student needs to translate
into Chinese.
4. Characters: The system presents the Chinese
sentence in a character encoding.
5. Solo: The tutor stops being pro-active, but can
be consulted if necessary.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999791230769231">
Both the translation game and the dialogue game
will be illustrated live in the demonstration. The
systems can be evaluated by two types of basic per-
formance measures: (1) for each system, the recog-
nition accuracy and the translation accuracy serve
as an index of quality; (2) calculating the success
rate in the translation game and the number of turns
taken to complete each dialogue will provide a quan-
titative view of interaction. Also a pre- &amp; post-test
design in the user study will further confirm the ped-
agogic value of the systems. Ongoing and future
work involves expanding the domains supported and
introducing the games to the classroom setting.
