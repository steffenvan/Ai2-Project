This paper contributes to the theory of
substructural logics .that are of interest to
categorial grammarians. Combining se-
mantic ideas of Hepple [1990] and Mor-
rill [1990], proof-theoretic ideas of Venema
[1993b; 1993a] and the theory of equational
specifications, a class of resource-preserving
logics is defined, for which decidability and
completeness theorems are established.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999967888888889">
The last decade has seen a keen revival of investi-
gations into the suitability of using categorial gram-
mars as theories of natural language syntax and se-
mantics. Initially, this research was for the larger
part confined to the classical categorial calculi of Aj-
dukiewicz [1935] and Bar-Hillel [1953], and, in partic-
ular, the Lambek calculus L [Lambek, 1958], [Moort-
gat, 1988] and some of its close relatives.
Although it turned out to be easily applicable to
fairly large sets of linguistic data, one couldn&apos;t real-
istically expect the Lambek calculus to be able to ac-
count for all aspects of grammar. The reason for this
is the diversity of the constructions found in natural
language. The Lambek calculus is good at reflect-
ing surface phrase structure, but runs into problems
when other linguistic phenomena are to be described.
Consequently, recent work in categorial grammar has
shown a trend towards diversification of the ways in
which the linguistic algebra is structured, with an
accompanying ramification of proof theory.
One of the main innovations of the past few years
has been the introduction of unary type connectives,
usually termed modalities, that are used to reflect
certain special features linguistic entities may pos-
sess. This strand of research originates with Morrill
[1990], who adds to L a unary connective 0 with the
following proof rules:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.699338333333333">
or 1- A Diti
B, ri I- A
[oL]
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.965784310344828">
F, OB, F&apos; I- A or E- oA[
OF here denotes a sequence of types all of which
have 0 as their main connective. The S4-like modal-
ity 0 is introduced with the aim of providing an ap-
propriate means of dealing with certain intensional
phenomena. Consequently, 0 inherits Kripke&apos;s pos-
sible world semantics for modal logic. The proof sys-
tem which arises from adding Morrill&apos;s left and right
rules for 0 to the Lambek calculus L will be called
LO.
Hepple [1990] presents a detailed investigation into
the possibilities of using the calculus LO to account
for purely syntactic phenomena, notably the well-
known Island Constraints of Ross [19671. Starting
from the usual interpretation of the Lambek calculus
in semigroups L, where types are taken to denote
subsets of L, he proposes to let 0 refer to a fixed
subsemigroup Lo of L, which leads to the following
definition of its semantics:
[Dm = [A] n La
As we have shown elsewhere [Versmissen, 199211
the calculus LO is sound with respect to this seman-
tics, but not complete. This can be remedied by
&apos;This paper discusses semigroup semantics for L and
LO in detail, and is well-suited as an easy-going in-
troduction to the ideas presented here. It is available

replacing the rule [OR] with the following stronger
version:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.966330333333333">
F1 F OBI ... r F. oBri r1, , r F A
[OR&apos;]
rn I- OA
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999676222222222">
Hepple [1990] also investigates the benefits of us-
ing the so-called structural modalities originally pro-
posed in [Morrill et al., 1990], for the description
of certain discontinuity and dislocality phenomena.
The idea here is that such modalities allow a limited
access to certain structural rules. Thus, we could for
example have a permutation modality Op with the
following proof rule (in addition to [OpL] and [Opal]
as before):
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.8475765">
c[ElpA, 13] C
r[B, opA] c
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.998109">
The symbol I here indicates that the inference is
valid in both directions. The interpretation of Op
would then be taken care of by a subsemigroup Lop
of L having the property that x-y=y•x whenever
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.86104">
E Lop or y E Log.
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.992944518518519">
Alternatively, one could require all types in such
an inference to be boxed:
F[OpA, OpB] F C
r[OpB, OpA] F C
In this case, Lop would have to be such that x • y =
y x whenever x,y E Log.
Closely related to the use of structural modalities
is the trend of considering different kinds of prod-
uct connectives, sometimes combined into a single
system. For example, Moortgat &amp; Morrill [1992]
present an account of dependency structure in terms
of headed prosodic trees, using a calculus that pos-
sesses two product operators instead of just one. On
the basis of this, Moortgat [1992] sketches a land-
scape of substructural logics parametrized by prop-
erties such as commutativity, associativity and de-
pendency. He then goes on to show how structural
modalities can be used to locally enhance or con-
strain the possibilities of type combination. Morrill
[1992] has a non-associative prosodic calculus, and
uses a structural modality to reintroduce associativ-
ity at certain points.
The picture that emerges is the following. Instead
of the single product operator of L, one considers a
range of different product operators, reflecting differ-
ent modes of linguistic structuring. This results in
a landscape of substructural logics, which are ulti-
mately to be combined into a single system. Specific
linguistic phenomena are given an account in terms
of type constructors that are specially tailored for
their description. On certain occasions it is necessary
for entities to &apos;escape&apos; the rules of the type construc-
tor that governs their behaviour. This is achieved by
means of structural modalities, which license con-
trolled travel through the substructural landscape.
Venema [1993a] proves a completeness theorem,
with respect to the mentioned algebraic interpreta-
tion, for the Lambek calculus extended with a per-
mutation modality. He modifies the proof system by
introducing a type constant Q which refers explicitily
to the subalgebra Lo. This proof system is adapted
to cover a whole range of substructural logics in [Ve-
nema, 1993b]. However, the semantics given in that
paper, which is adopted from Bolen [1988; 1989], dif-
fers in several respects from the one discussed above.
Most importantly, models are required to possess a
partial order with a well-behaved interaction with
the product operation. In the remainder of this pa-
per we will give a fairly general definition of the no-
tion of a resource-preserving logic. The proof theory
of these logics is based on that of Venema, while their
semantics, with respect to which a completeness the-
orem will be established, is similar to that of Hepple
and Morrill.

<bodyText confidence="0.792455818181818">
The languages of the logics that will be considered
here are specified by the following parameters:
I&gt; Three finite, disjoint index sets I, 3 and IC;
1&gt; A finite set B of basic types.
Given these, we define the following sets of expres-
sions:
C&gt; The set of binary type connectives
C = {/,\}z;
t&gt; Two sets of unary type connectives
MA = {LJ}jE3 and Mv = {Vk}kEx;

I&gt; The set of structural connectives SC = odiax;
t&gt; The set of structures S, being the inductive clo-
sure of T under SC;
t&gt; The set of sequents {F FAIFE S, A E T}.
The division of the unary type connectives into two
sets MA and Mv reflects the alternatives mentioned
in Section 1. Modalities Ai are those whose struc-
tural rules only apply when all types involved are
prefixed with them, whereas only a single type pre-
fixed with vk needs to be involved in order for the
accompanying structural rules to be applicable.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998968">
2.2 Equational specifications
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999856">
We will use equational specifications to describe the
structural behaviour of connectives and modalities,
as well as the algebraic structures in which these are
interpreted. To start with, we recall several impor-
tant definitions and results.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.993684">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.995867277777778">
A signature E is a collection of function symbols,
each of which has a fixed arity. Let V be a countably
infinite set of variables. The term algebra T(E,V) is
defined as the inductive closure of V under E. An
equational specification is a pair (E, E) where E is a
signature and E is a set of equations s = t of terms
s, t E T(, V). A E-algebra A is a set A together
with functions FA : An —+ A for all n-ary function
symbols F E E. A E-algebra A is a model for a set
of equations E over T(E, V), written as A k E, if
every equation of 6 holds in A. A (E, E)-algebra is
a E-algebra that is a model for E.
Let E be an equational specification. Then we de-
fine e to be the equational specification obtained
from E by prefixing each variable occurrence with
Ai. The equational specification Ev„ is defined as
follows (where V(F = G) denotes the set of variables
occurring in F = G):

<figure confidence="0.624779">
(P=c)fr.--vkil ED
(F=G)vk ED
Cy,. ED
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.996293">
To give a concrete example of these definitions, let E
consist of the following two equations:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9709278">
+ y •= y + x
x + (y + z) = (x + z
Then 6,6,1 contains these two:
x + y = Aiy + Aix
Aix + (Aiy + Aiz) = (Az+A1y)+A1z
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.931031777777778">
whereas Evk is comprised of five equations in all:
== YV±k yV-f-k xx
(vkx+y)-Fx
= (x+pky)-Fx
= (x+y)+Vkz
We will call a term equation resource-preserving if
each variable occurs the same number of times on
both sides of the equality sign. An equational spec-
ification is resource-preserving if all of its member
equations are. Note that this definition encompasses
the important cases of commutativity and associa-
tivity. On the other hand, well-known rules such
as weakening and contraction can&apos;t be modelled by
resource-preserving equations. Not only do they fail
to be resource-preserving in the strict sense intro-
duced here, but also they are one-way rules that
would have to be described by means of rewrite rules
rather than equations.

Of course, all equational specifications occurring in
the above list are required to be resource-preserving.
The operator + is intended as a generic one, which
is to be replaced by a specific connective of the lan-

the equational specification obtained by substituting
* for + in E, but will drop this superscript when it

2.5 Some sample applications
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999994571428571">
We will address the logical aspects of the calculi de-
fined in the last section shortly, but first we pause for
a brief intermezzo, illustrating how they are applied
in linguistic practice.
As our first example we look at how the Lambek
calculus deals with extraction. Suppose we have the
following type assignments:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.932176">
John, Mary : NP
loves : NP\S/NP
madly : (NP\S)\(NP\S)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.998418333333333">
We would like to find type assignments to who
such that we can derive type REL for the following
phrases:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.998970333333333">
1. who John loves
2. who loves Mary
3. who John loves madly
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.982683727272727">
As is easily seen, assignment of RELAS/NP) to who
works for the first sentence, while RELANP\S) is the
appropriate type to assign to who to get the second
case right. However, the third case can&apos;t be done
in the Lambek calculus, since we have no way of
referring to gaps occuring inside larger constituents;
we only have access to the periphery. This can be
handled by adding a permutation modality VP and
assigning to who the type REL/(S/ VP NP) to who.
This single type assignment works for all three cases.
For the third sentence, this is worked out in Figure 1.
As a second example, consider the following noun
phrase:
the man at the desk
For the nouns and the determiner we make the usual
type assignments:
the : NP/N
man, desk : N
From a prosodic point of view, at should be assigned
type (N N)/NP. However, semantically at combines
not just with the noun it modifies, but with the en-
tire noun phrase headed by that noun. Moortgat
Morrill [1992] show how both these desiderata can
be fulfilled. First, the type assignment to at is lifted
to ((NPAN \N))\NP)/NP in order to force the re-
quired semantic combination. This is not the end
of the story, because due to the non-associativity of
the prosodic algebra we still can&apos;t derive a type NP
for the man at the desk. To enable this, they add a
structural modality VA to the type assignment for
at to make it ((NP/VA (N\N))\NP)/NP, after which
things work out nicely, as is shown by the derivation
in Figure 2.

2.6 Cut-elimination and the subformula
property
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9987845">
Before turning to the semantics of G we will prove
the Cut-elimination theorem and subformula prop-
erty for it, since the latter is essential for the com-
pleteness proof, and a corollary to the former.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.994063">
380
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.9996487">
As we remarked earlier, our proof rules are
adapted from [Venema, 1993b]. Therefore, we can
refer the reader to that paper for most of the Cut-
elimination proof. The only notable difference be-
tween both systems lies in the structural rules they
allow. Note that resource-preservation implies that
for any [Eu )]-inference we have the following two sim-
ple but important properties (where the complexity
of a type is defined as the number of connectives oc-
curring in it):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.983967666666667">
1. Each type occurring in r occurs also in A, and
vice versa;
2. The complexity of r equals that of A.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999818071428571">
Therefore, in the case of an [4)]-inference, we can
always move [Cut] upwards like this is done in Ve-
nema&apos;s paper, and thus obtain an application of [Cut]
of lower degree. Hence, [Cut] is eliminable from G.
The subformula property says that any provable
sequent has a proof in which only subformulas of that
sequent occur. Under the proviso that Qi is consid-
ered a subtype of Ai A, and Q k of vk A, the subfor-
mula property follows from Cut-elimination, since in
each inference rule other than [Cut], the premises are
made up of subformulas of the conclusion.
Let C. be the logic obtained from .0 by adding a
set of product connectives feibET to the language,
and the following inference rules to the proof system:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.92390475">
r oi I- A FI-A A B
[, L] [ R]
F *i A F- 4
A r oi I-Afai B .,
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999780705882353">
Like E, the system C, enjoys Cut-elimination and
the subformula property. Note that this implies that
if an C-sequent is L.-derivable, then it is C-derivable.
This property will be used several times in the course
of the completeness proof.
Now consider a naive top-down2 proof search strat-
egy. At every step, we have a finite choice of possi-
ble applications of an inference rule, and every such
application either removes a connective occurence,
thus diminishing the complexity of the sequent to
be proved, or rewrites the sequent&apos;s antecedent to a
term of equal complexity. Therefore, if we make sure
that a search path is relinquished whenever a sequent
reappears on it (which prevents the procedure from
entering into an infinite loop), the proof search tree
will be finite. This implies that the calculus is decid-
able.

It will not have escaped the reader&apos;s attention that
we have failed to include the set of product con-
nectives ItodiE7 in the language of the resource-
preserving logics. The reason for this is that a com-
pleteness proof along the above lines runs into prob-
lems for such extended logics. This is already the
case for the full Lambek calculus. Buszkowski [1986]
presents a rather complicated completeness proof for
that logic. It remains to be seen whether his ap-
proach also works in the present setting.
Although we&apos;ve tried to give a liberal definition
of what constitutes a resource-preserving logic, some
choices had to be made in order to keep things man-
ageable. There is room for alternative definitions,
especially concerning the interaction of the modali-
ties with the different product operators. It would
seem to be worthwile to study some of the systems
that have occurred in practice in detail on the basis
of the ideas presented in this paper.

Finally, it is important to realize that we limited
ourselves to resource-preserving logics in order to ob-
tain relatively easy proofs of Cut-elimination and
decidability. Since such results tend also to hold
for many systems with rules that are not resource-
preserving, such as weakening and contraction, it is
probably possible to characterize a larger class of
equational theories for which these properties can be
proved. We hope to address this point on a later
occassion.

The proof system which arises from adding Morrill&apos;s left and right rules for 0 to the Lambek calculus L will be called LO. Hepple [1990] presents a detailed investigation into the possibilities of using the calculus LO to account for purely syntactic phenomena, notably the wellknown Island Constraints of Ross [19671. Starting from the usual interpretation of the Lambek calculus in semigroups L, where types are taken to denote subsets of L, he proposes to let 0 refer to a fixed subsemigroup Lo of L, which leads to the following definition of its semantics: [Dm = [A] n La As we have shown elsewhere [Versmissen, 199211 the calculus LO is sound with respect to this semantics, but not complete.
