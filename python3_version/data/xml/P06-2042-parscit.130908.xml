Japanese dependency structure is usu-
ally represented by relationships between
phrasal units called bunsetsus. One of the
biggest problems with dependency struc-
ture analysis in spontaneous speech is that
clause boundaries are ambiguous. This
paper describes a method for detecting
the boundaries of quotations and inserted
clauses and that for improving the depen-
dency accuracy by applying the detected
boundaries to dependency structure anal-
ysis. The quotations and inserted clauses
are determined by using an SVM-based
text chunking method that considers in-
formation on morphemes, pauses, fillers,
etc. The information on automatically an-
alyzed dependency structure is also used
to detect the beginning of the clauses.
Our evaluation experiment using Corpus
of Spontaneous Japanese (CSJ) showed
that the automatically estimated bound-
aries of quotations and inserted clauses
helped to improve the accuracy of depen-
dency structure analysis.

<bodyText confidence="0.98840015">
The “Spontaneous Speech: Corpus and Pro-
cessing Technology” project sponsored the con-
struction of the Corpus of Spontaneous Japanese
(CSJ) (Maekawa et al., 2000). The CSJ is the
biggest spontaneous speech corpus in the world,
consisting of roughly 7M words with the total
speech length of 700 hours, and is a collection of
monologues such as academic presentations and
simulated public speeches. The CSJ includes tran-
scriptions of the speeches as well as audio record-
ings of them. Approximately one tenth of the
speeches in the CSJ were manually annotated with
various kinds of information such as morphemes,
sentence boundaries, dependency structures, and
discourse structures.
In Japanese sentences, word order is rather
free, and subjects or objects are often omitted.
In Japanese, therefore, the syntactic structure of
a sentence is generally represented by the re-
lationships between phrasal units, or bunsetsus
in Japanese, based on a dependency grammar,
as represented in the Kyoto University text cor-
pus (Kurohashi and Nagao, 1997). In the same
way, the syntactic structure of a sentence is repre-
sented by dependency relationships between bun-
setsus in the CSJ. For example, the sentence “
” (He is walking slowly) can
be divided into three bunsetsus, “ , kare-wa”
(he), “ , yukkuri” (slowly), and “
, arui-te-iru” (is walking). In this sentence,
the first and second bunsetsus depend on the third
one. The dependency structure is described as fol-
lows.
(he)
(slowly)
(is walking)
In this paper, we first describe the problems
with dependency structure analysis of spontaneous
speech. We focus on ambiguous clause boundaries
as the biggest problem and present a solution.

pendency structure analysis, such as ambiguous
clause boundaries, independent bunsetsus, crossed
dependencies, self-corrections, and inversions. In
this study, we address the problem of ambiguous
clause boundaries in dependency structure analy-
sis in spontaneous speech. We treated the other
problems in the same way as Shitaoka et al. (Shi-
taoka et al., 2004). For example, inversions are
represented as dependency relationships going in
the direction from right to left in the CSJ, and their
direction was changed to that from left to right in
our experiments. In this paper, therefore, all the
dependency relationships were assumed to go in
the direction from left to right (Uchimoto et al.,
2006).
There are several types of clause boundaries
such as sentence boundaries, boundaries of quo-
tations and inserted clauses. In the CSJ, clause
boundaries were automatically detected by using
surface information (Maruyama et al., 2003), and
sentence boundaries were manually selected from
them (Takanashi et al., 2003). Boundaries of
quotations and inserted clauses were also defined
and detected manually. Dependency relationships
between bunsetsus were annotated within sen-
tences (Uchimoto et al., 2006). Our definition of
clause boundaries follows the definition used in
the CSJ.
Shitaoka et al. worked on automatic sen-
tence boundary detection by using SVM-based
text chunking. However, quotations and inserted
clauses were not considered. In this paper, we fo-
cus on these problems in a context of ambiguous
clause boundaries.

Quotations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.983336833333333">
In written text, quotations are often bracketed by
(angle brackets), but no brackets are inserted in
spontaneous speech.
ex) “ ” (I want to
go there at any rate) is a quotation. In the CSJ,
quotations were manually annotated as follows.

Dependency relationships are closed within a
quotation or an inserted clause. Therefore, de-
pendencies except the rightmost bunsetsu in each
clause do not cross boundaries of the same clause,
meaning no dependency exists between the bun-
setsu inside a clause and that outside the clause.
However, automatically detected dependencies of-
ten cross clause boundaries erroneously because
sentences including quotations or inserted clauses
can have complicated clause structures. This is
one of the reasons dependency structure analysis
of spontaneous speech has more errors than that of
written texts. We propose a method for improving
dependency structure analysis based on automatic
detection of quotations and inserted clauses.

lyze dependency structures. This method is a two-
step procedure, and the first step is preparation of
a dependency matrix in which each element repre-
sents the likelihood that one bunsetsu depends on
another. The second step of the analysis is find-
ing an optimal set of dependencies for the entire
sentence. The likelihood of dependency is repre-
sented by a probability, using a dependency proba-
bility model. The model in this study (Uchimoto et
al., 2000) takes into account not only the relation-
ship between two bunsetsus but also the relation-
ship between the left bunsetsu and all the bunsetsu
to its right.
We implemented this model within a maximum
entropy modeling framework. The features used
in the model were basically attributes related to
the target two bunsetsus: attributes of a bunsetsu
itself, such as character strings, parts of speech,
and inflection types of a bunsetsu together with at-
tributes between bunsetsus, such as the distance
between bunsetsus, etc. Combinations of these
features were also used. In this work, we added
to the features whether there is a boundary of quo-
tations or inserted clauses between the target bun-
setsus. If there is, the probability that the left bun-
setsu depends on the right bunsetsu is estimated to
be low.
In the CSJ, some bunsetsus are defined to have
no modifiee. In our experiments, we defined their
dependencies as follows.

<listItem confidence="0.9776">
• The rightmost bunsetsu in a quotation or an
inserted clause depends on the rightmost one

• If a sentence boundary is included in a quo-

the immediate left of the boundary depends
on the rightmost bunsetsu in the quotation or
the inserted clause.
• Other bunsetsus that have no modifiee de-
pend on the next one.

We regard the problem of clause boundary de-
tection as a text chunking task. We used Yam-
Cha (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2001) as a text chun-
ker, which is based on Support Vector Machine
(SVM). We used the chunk labels consisting of
three tags which correspond to sentence bound-
aries, boundaries of quotations, and boundaries of
inserted clauses, respectively. The tag for sentence

Clause consisting of one bunsetsu
boundaries can be either E (the rightmost bunsetsu
in a sentence) or I (the others). The tags for the
boundaries of quotations and inserted clauses are
shown in Table 1. An example of chunk labels as-
signed to each bunsetsu in a sentence is as follows.
ex) “ ” (It is because of the budget)
is a quotation, and “ ”
(which I think is because of the budget) is an in-
serted clause. For a chunk label, for example, the
bunsetsu that the chunk label (I, B, B) is assigned
to means that it is not related to a sentence bound-
ary but is related to the beginning of a quotation
and an inserted clause.
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.513876">
(I,O,O) (now)

(I,O,O) (three times)
(E,O,O) (they do it)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9996657">
The three tags of each chunk label are simulta-
neously estimated. Therefore, the relationships
between sentence boundaries, quotations, and in-
serted clauses are considered in this model. For in-
stance, quotations and inserted clauses should not
cross the sentence boundaries, and the chunk label
such as (E,I,O) is never estimated because this la-
bel means that a sentence boundary exists within a
quotation.
We used the following parameters for YamCha.

The chunk label is estimated for each bunsetsu,
The features used to estimate the chunk labels are
as follows.

such as character strings, pronunciation, part
of speech, inflection type, and inflection
form. Specific expressions are often used at
the ends of quotations and inserted clauses.

of quotations. Expressions such as “
, desu-ga” and “ , keredo-mo” are
used at the ends of inserted clauses.
(2) fillers and pauses Fillers and pauses are often
inserted just before or after quotations and in-
serted clauses. Pause duration is normalized
in a talk with its mean and variance.
(3) speaking rate Inside inserted clauses, speak-
ers tend to speak fast. The speaking rate is
also normalized in a talk.

<bodyText confidence="0.989513264705883">
Detecting the ends of clauses appears easy be-
cause specific expressions are frequently used at
the ends of clauses as previously mentioned. How-
ever, determining the beginnings of clauses is dif-
ficult in a single process because all features men-
tioned above are local information. Therefore, the
global information is also used to detect the begin-
ning of the clauses. If the end of a clause is given,
the bunsetsus to the left of the clause should sat-
isfy the two conditions described in Figure 2. Our
method uses the constraint as global information.
They are considered as additional features based
on dependency probabilities estimated for the bun-
setsus to the left of the clause. Thus, our chunk-
ing method has two steps. First, clause boundaries
are detected based on the three types of features
itemized above. Second, the beginnings of clauses
are determined after adding to the features the fol-
lowing probabilities obtained by automatic depen-
dency structure analysis.
(4) probability that bunsetsu to left of target de-
pends on bunsetsu inside clause
(5) probability that bunsetsu to immediate left
of target depends on bunsetsu to right of clause
Figure 2 shows that the target bunsetsu is likely
to be the beginning of the clause if probability (4)
is low and probability (5) is high. For instance,
the following example sentence has an inserted
clause. In the first chunking step, the bunsetsu
“ ” (which is a story) is found to
be the end of the inserted clause.
ex) “ ” (which is a
story that I heard from my father) is an inserted
clause.

, kii-ta”, and “ ,hanashi-na-

“ , chichi-kara” is the most likely to be the

For experimental evaluation, we used the tran-
scriptions of 188 talks in the CSJ, which contain
6,255 quotations and 818 inserted clauses. We
used 20 talks for testing. The test data included
643 quotations and 76 inserted clauses. For train-
ing, we used 168 talks excluding the test data to
conduct the open test and all the 188 talks to con-
duct the closed test.
First, we detected sentence boundaries by using
the method (Shitaoka et al., 2004) and analyzed
the dependency structure of each sentence by the
method described in Section 3.1 without using in-
formation on quotations and inserted clauses. We
obtained an F-measure of 85.9 for the sentence
boundary detection, and the baseline accuracy of
the dependency structure analysis was 77.7% for
the open test and 86.5% for the closed test.

Section 3.2 are shown in Table 2. The table shows
five kinds of results:

• results obtained without dependency struc-

• results obtained with dependency structure

• results obtained with manually annotated de-
pendency structure (in the second chunking
step)
• the rate that the ends of clauses are detected
correctly
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999607733333333">
These results indicate that around 90% of quo-
tations were detected correctly, and the boundary
detection accuracy of quotations was improved by
using automatically analyzed dependency struc-
ture. We found that features (4) and (5) in Section
3.2 obtained from automatically analyzed depen-
dency structure contributed to the improvement.
In the following example, a part of the quotation
“ ” (my good virtue)
was erroneously detected as a quotation in the first
chunking step. But, in the second chunking step,
automatically analyzed dependency structure con-
tributed to detection of the correct part “
” (this is my good virtue)
as a quotation.

We also found that the boundary detection accu-
racy of quotations was significantly improved by
using manually annotated dependency structure.
This indicates that the boundary detection accu-
racy of quotations improves as the accuracy of de-
pendency structure analysis improves.
By contrast, only a few inserted clauses were
detected even if dependency structures were used.
Most of the ends of the inserted clauses were de-
tected incorrectly as sentence boundaries. The
main reason for this is our method could not distin-
guish between the ends of the inserted clauses and
those of the sentences, since the same words often
appeared at the ends of both, and it was difficult

We investigated the accuracies of dependency
structure analysis obtained when the automatically
or manually detected boundaries of quotations and
inserted clauses were used. The results are shown
in Table 3. Although the accuracy of detecting the
boundaries of quotations and inserted clauses us-
ing automatically analyzed dependency structure
was not high, the accuracy of dependency struc-

the open test. This shows that the model for depen-
dency structure analysis could robustly learn use-
ful information on clause boundaries even if errors
were included in the results of clause boundary de-
tection. In the following example, for instance,
“ ” (to go out with its

in the first chunking step. Then, the initial in-

We investigated the clause boundary detection
accuracy of quotations and inserted clauses and
the dependency accuracy when correct sentence
boundaries were given manually. The results are
shown in Tables 4 and 5, respectively.
When correct sentence boundaries were given,
the accuracy of clause detection and dependency
structure analysis was improved significantly. Ta-
ble 4 shows that the boundary detection accuracy
of inserted clauses as well as that of quotations
was significantly improved by using information
of dependencies. Table 5 indicates that when us-
ing automatically detected clause boundaries, the
accuracy of dependency structure analysis was im-
proved by 0.7% for the open test, and it was further
improved by using correct clause boundaries.
These experimental results show that detecting
the boundaries of quotations and inserted clauses
as well as sentence boundaries is sensitive to the
accuracy of dependency structure analysis and the
improvements of the boundary detection of quo-
tations and inserted clauses contribute to improve-
ment of dependency structure analysis. Especially,
the difference between Table3 and 5 shows that
the sentence boundary detection accuracy is more
sensitive to the accuracy of dependency structure
analysis than the boundary detection accuracy of
quotations and inserted clauses. This indicates that
sentence boundaries rather than quotations and in-
serted clauses should be manually examined first
to effectively improve the accuracy of dependency
structure analysis in a semi-automatic way.

This paper describes a method for detecting the boundaries of quotations and inserted clauses and that for improving the dependency accuracy by applying the detected boundaries to dependency structure analysis. The quotations and inserted clauses are determined by using an SVM-based text chunking method that considers information on morphemes, pauses, fillers, etc. The information on automatically analyzed dependency structure is also used to detect the beginning of the clauses. evaluation experiment using Spontaneous Japanese (CSJ) that the automatically estimated boundaries of quotations and inserted clauses helped to improve the accuracy of dependency structure analysis.</abstract>

In our experiments, we defined their dependencies as follows. • The rightmost bunsetsu in a quotation or an inserted clause depends on the rightmost one in the sentence. • If a sentence boundary is included in a quotation or an inserted clause, the bunsetsu to the immediate left of the boundary depends on the rightmost bunsetsu in the quotation or the inserted clause. • Other bunsetsus that have no modifiee depend on the next one. 3.2 Detection of Quotations and Inserted Clauses We regard the problem of clause boundary detection as a text chunking task. We used YamCha (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2001) as a text chunker, which is based on Support Vector Machine (SVM). We used the chunk labels consisting of three tags which correspond to sentence boundaries, boundaries of quotations, and boundaries of inserted clauses, respectively. The tag for sentence Table 1: Tag categories used for chunking Tag Explanation of tag Beginning of a clause End of a clause Interior of a clause (except B and E) Exterior of a clause Clause consisting of one bunsetsu boundaries can be either E (the rightmost bunsetsu in a sentence) or I (the others).

Approximately one tenth of the speeches in the CSJ were manually annotated with various kinds of information such as morphemes, sentence boundaries, dependency structures, and discourse structures. In Japanese sentences, word order is rather free, and subjects or objects are often omitted. In Japanese, therefore, the syntactic structure of a sentence is generally represented by the relationships between phrasal units, or bunsetsus in Japanese, based on a dependency grammar, as represented in the Kyoto University text corpus (Kurohashi and Nagao, 1997). In the same way, the syntactic structure of a sentence is represented by dependency relationships between bunsetsus in the CSJ. For example, the sentence “ ” (He is walking slowly) can be divided into three bunsetsus, “ , kare-wa” (he), “ , yukkuri” (slowly), and “ , arui-te-iru” (is walking). In this sentence, the first and second bunsetsus depend on the third one. The dependency structure is described as follows.

Our evaluation experiment using Corpus of Spontaneous Japanese (CSJ) showed that the automatically estimated boundaries of quotations and inserted clauses helped to improve the accuracy of dependency structure analysis. 1 Introduction The “Spontaneous Speech: Corpus and Processing Technology” project sponsored the construction of the Corpus of Spontaneous Japanese (CSJ) (Maekawa et al., 2000). The CSJ is the biggest spontaneous speech corpus in the world, consisting of roughly 7M words with the total speech length of 700 hours, and is a collection of monologues such as academic presentations and simulated public speeches. The CSJ includes transcriptions of the speeches as well as audio recordings of them. Approximately one tenth of the speeches in the CSJ were manually annotated with various kinds of information such as morphemes, sentence boundaries, dependency structures, and discourse structures.

For example, inversions are represented as dependency relationships going in the direction from right to left in the CSJ, and their direction was changed to that from left to right in our experiments. In this paper, therefore, all the dependency relationships were assumed to go in the direction from left to right (Uchimoto et al., 2006). There are several types of clause boundaries such as sentence boundaries, boundaries of quotations and inserted clauses. In the CSJ, clause boundaries were automatically detected by using surface information (Maruyama et al., 2003), and sentence boundaries were manually selected from them (Takanashi et al., 2003). Boundaries of quotations and inserted clauses were also defined and detected manually. Dependency relationships between bunsetsus were annotated within sentences (Uchimoto et al., 2006). Our definition of clause boundaries follows the definition used in the CSJ. Shitaoka et al. worked on automatic sentence boundary detection by using SVM-based text chunking. However, quotations and inserted clauses were not considered. In this paper, we focus on these problems in a context of ambiguous clause boundaries. Quota</context>

This is one of the reasons dependency structure analysis of spontaneous speech has more errors than that of written texts. We propose a method for improving dependency structure analysis based on automatic detection of quotations and inserted clauses. 3 Dependency Structure Analysis and Detection of Quotations and Inserted Clauses The outline of the proposed processes is shown in Figure 1. Here, we use “clause” to describe a quotation and an inserted clause. 3.1 Dependency Structure Analysis In this research, we use the method proposed by Uchimoto et al. (Uchimoto et al., 2000) to ana325 lyze dependency structures. This method is a twostep procedure, and the first step is preparation of a dependency matrix in which each element represents the likelihood that one bunsetsu depends on another. The second step of the analysis is finding an optimal set of dependencies for the entire sentence. The likelihood of dependency is represented by a probability, using a dependency probability model. The model in this study (Uchimoto et al., 2000) takes into account not only the relationship between two bunsetsus but also the relationship between the left bunsetsu and all the buns</context>

We used 20 talks for testing. The test data included 643 quotations and 76 inserted clauses. For training, we used 168 talks excluding the test data to conduct the open test and all the 188 talks to conduct the closed test. First, we detected sentence boundaries by using the method (Shitaoka et al., 2004) and analyzed the dependency structure of each sentence by the method described in Section 3.1 without using information on quotations and inserted clauses. We obtained an F-measure of 85.9 for the sentence boundary detection, and the baseline accuracy of the dependency structure analysis was 77.7% for the open test and 86.5% for the closed test. 327 (a) Results of clause boundary detection The results obtained by the method described in Section 3.2 are shown in Table 2.
