Edited collections of papers are something of a tradition in fields such as computational
linguistics and knowledge representation; probably most readers of this journal are
familiar with the classic Readings in Natural Language Processing (Grosz, Sp¨arck Jones,
and Webber 1986). Such collections play a valuable role in assembling the (often scat-
tered) primary texts that define swiftly evolving research areas. At first glance, the
present collection seems to belong to this genre. A closer look reveals that its editors
are attempting something rather more ambitious: They want to simultaneously define a
research area and to provide it with a reference tool that can help shape further research.
To put it another way, this is a reader with its eyes firmly on the future, not the past.
Not that the past is neglected. Part I of the book (“Tense, aspect and event struc-
ture”) includes older material, some of it drawn from the philosophical tradition; the
voices of Zeno Vendler on verb classification, Arthur Prior on hybrid logic, and Hans
Reichenbach on temporal reference can all be heard here. But the historical perspective
takes second place. The major concern is to explicate, as clearly as possible, the themes
that have shaped research on temporal language, and following the publication timeline
is not the best way to do this. Thus, although the collection opens in 1967 (with Vendler),
the second paper fast-forwards the reader to 1991 (James Pustejovsky on event struc-
ture), the third takes us to 1986 (Emmon Bach on the algebra of events), and the fourth
catapults us all the way back to 1947 (Reichenbach), after which we wend our way
forward (with the occasional temporal bounce) toward more recent work.
Sound confusing? It’s not. On the contrary, this is one of the best-structured collec-
tions I’ve ever had the pleasure of reading. Indeed, to call it a collection is to diminish
it: This is an edited volume, with edit being used in a strong sense of the word. The
editors are not passive contributors to this volume: They provide background, structure
the material, and (in two useful places) supply newer material that enables the reader
to evaluate (and in some cases, perhaps, to reevaluate) the significance of the various
contributions. A great deal of effort has gone into the preparation of this volume, and it
shows.
The volume, which contains 29 articles, has a four-part structure. As mentioned
above, Part I deals with tense, aspect, and event structure, and contains the oldest
material in the volume. Part II is entitled “Temporal reasoning,” and for the most part
contains material from the 1980s (such as the classic papers on temporal logic by James
Allen and Drew McDermott). Part III, “Temporal structure and discourse,” straddles
the 1980s and 1990s, and all of the articles in Part IV, “Temporal annotation,” are from
2001 or later.
Moreover, the editors are at pains to provide a coherent intellectual context within
which to interpret the collected material. For a start, each of the four parts has an
Computational Linguistics Volume 32, Number 3
introduction written by the editors. These introduce, and to some extent evaluate, the
main ideas and tools on which the following articles build. For example, the intro-
duction to Part III contains a succinct (and highly readable) introduction to Discourse
Representation Theory, and the introduction to Part IV discusses the underlying tech-
niques, tools, and methodological problems associated with temporal annotation tasks.
These introductions are not wholly neutral (it is clear that the editors have firm ideas
about the relative importance of various proposals), but the issues are discussed in an
even-handed way; the editors’ predilections simply provide sufficient spice to ensure
that the introductions don’t descend into blandness.
Furthermore, on two occasions the editors intervene (in collaboration with others)
to provide new articles that fill serious gaps. The first such intervention occurs at the end
of Part II on temporal reasoning. While it is in principle useful to have available various
temporal logics for performing reasoning, the potential of such logics is enhanced if
their key concepts can be embodied in temporal annotation schemas. Accordingly,
James Pustejovsky, in collaboration with Jerry Hobbs, supplies an essentially new ar-
ticle describing the TimeML annotation schema and how it can be interpreted in the
OWL-Time ontology of temporal concepts; this provides an important link between the
classic AI-based work of Part II and the more recent empirically oriented NLP work
described in Part IV of the volume. The second such intervention occurs in Part IV where
Pustejovsky et al. provide an updated introduction to TimeML.
I can’t think of any articles that really should be here but aren’t. Perhaps the most
obvious omission is Davidson (1967) on events, but while this (widely anthologized)
paper could have been included, I think the editors were right not to; its key idea has
long been assimilated and is more than adequately reflected in other papers in the col-
lection. And the editors show impeccable taste in the papers they do select. For example,
not only do they include James Allen’s classic paper on temporal representation and
reasoning, they also include Antony Galton’s clear and thoughtful critique of his work.
And there were (for me at any rate) some pleasant surprises. For example, I had never
previously encountered Allan Bell’s intriguing work on news stories as narrative, and I
found his contribution a real eye-opener.
Summing up, this is a superb collection of primary material on how we talk about,
reason about, and represent, temporal information. But it’s far more than the sum of
its parts. Thanks to the editorial work that has gone into it, this book is a genuinely
useful resource, one that will guide work in this domain over the next decade and more.
It belongs on the bookshelf of any linguist, computer scientist, or logician interested
in temporal reasoning. But most of all, it belongs on the shelf of any reader of this
journal interested in the role that temporal information has to play in natural language
processing.
