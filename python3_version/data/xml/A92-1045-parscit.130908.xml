1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.996486306122449">
Interactive user environments have been a central efficiency-
enhancing feature of many modern computer applications,
including natural language processing. There are two ma-
jor classes of users for whom NLP environments can be
constructed — developers and end users, such as technical
writers and translators. Developers need help in the various
knowledge acquisition tasks, such as dictionary and grammar
writing for NLP applications. End users look for efficiency
enhancements in document preparation beyond the level of
word processing support. There are two approaches to the
solution of this problem. A dedicated workstation can be de-
veloped for each of the required functionalities. Alternatively,
workstations can be configured as sets of application routines
attached to a universal user interface.
In this report we describe a general-purpose user environ-
ment, under development at the Center for Machine Transla-
tion of Carnegie Mellon University, capable of supporting a
number of dedicated workstation configurations. Among the
types of end users whom this system will benefit are techni-
cal writers, text revisors and translators. In the framework
of NLP system development this tool supports dictionary and
ontology acquisition.
A number of separate functionalities included in this system
have been developed and used either in commercial word pro-
cessing software packages or in NLP projects (e.g., the transla-
tor&apos;s tools described in Macklovitch, 1989,; and the developer
environments IRACQ (Ayuso et al., 1987), LUKE (Wrob-
lewski and Rich, 1988) or ONTOS (Monarch and Nirenburg,
1989), among many others). Our system allows a merge of
the two directions in the tool development. One direct reason
to put the two previously separate kinds of functionality into a
single system was to support the knowledge-based machine-
aided translation environment which involves an interactive
human editor who uses an interface to help the machine un-
derstand the source text.
A standard Unix- and X-windows-based workstation plat-
form has been selected for our system, whose working name
is TWS, for &amp;quot;Translator&apos;s Workstation.&amp;quot; We also used the
C-based X11 toolkit called MOTIF (Motif, 1991) and its Com-
monLisp interface called CLM (Babatz et. al., 1991). In prac-
tice, TWS consists of a number of application (functionality)
modules which are integrated through the central MOTIF-based
user interface module. For reasons of uniformity, each of the
applications uses the facilities of the user interface for display
and input. Each module uses a standard window to interact
with the user, and each window has standard menus which,
among other functionalities, allow the user to invoke any other
module. Each module also has special menus.
The architecture of TWS is presented in Figure 1.

<bodyText confidence="0.99989796969697">
We illustrate the basic interface and several application util-
ities that have been connected to the TWS. Specifically, we
illustrate the text editor (an end-user functionality), the utility
for statistical processing of corpora (useful both for end users
and for developers) and the ontology acquisition and mainte-
nance tool, based on ONTOS (a developer functionality).
Due to the lack of space, we do not describe our interface to
reference sources, such as online dictionaries or user-defined
glossaries, or our interface-building interface which allows
both the TWS developer and TWS user define and modify the
user interfaces the system uses.
TWS is designed in such a way that various utilities can be
imported into the system, so that there is no need to imple-
ment every functionality locally. One example of an existing
imported module in TWS is a set of bilingual text alignment
routines. The concept of importing utilities is very important
to our work. The user interface facilities of the kind we de-
veloped makes it easy to import applications with a minimum
of effort and with a capability of making them &amp;quot;look and feel&amp;quot;
similarly to the rest of the applications in the system. In our
future work we intend to mix the development of utilities with
importing and integrating existing applications, whenever that
is desirable and feasible.
Figure 2 shows a basic editing window of TWS. The central
feature of the TWS editor is its capability to emulate various
existing word processors. This feature is important from the
standpoint of acceptance of the workstation environments by
end users. Currently the editor emulates WORD PERFECTIm
and EMACS.
Figure 3 illustrates the corpus processing functionality. It
can be used by end users to compare the usage of a term in
various places in a set of documents and by the developer to
gain insights for dictionary and ontology acquisition.

A detailed discussion of the ONTOS system see in
Monarch, 1989, Carlson and Nirenbuig, 1991. To include
the ONTOS functionality into TWS, a new grapher has been
built. The grapher facilitates browsing through, editing, cre-
ating and deleting frames. An important feature is its ability
to handle graphs rather than trees, so that multiple inheri-
tance can be graphically represented. The ONTOS module
inside TWS also supports a structured editor for manipulating
ontological concepts symbolically.

We believe that the TWS GRAPHER compares favorably with
other graphers, notably the AGGREGRAPHS (see Dannenberg
et. al., 1991) which is part of the GARNET system and the ISI
GRAPHER (see Robins, 1988). Unlike AGGREGRAPHS, which
can only display a knowledge base, our grapher lets the user
edit it. As for the ISI GRAPHER, the latter cannot easily support
more than one type of link between nodes, while the TWS
grapher can support an unlimited number of links, as well as
validity and consistency tests for them.

<bodyText confidence="0.9996781">
Our work on TWS is continuing. At the time of this writing,
several additional functionalities are being developed, includ-
ing a machine-tractable lexicon acquisition module and a user
interface system for a machine-aided translation environment,
a descendent of the augmentor module of the KBMT-89 MT
system (Brown, 1991). On the end-user side, a general text
alignment facility is being developed, which will support the
work of mono- and multilingual document revisors by pin-
pointing the differences among different versions of a docu-
ment.
