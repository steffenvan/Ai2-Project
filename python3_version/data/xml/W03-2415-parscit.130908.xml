Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999980866666667">
The article takes a step back and ex-
amines the notion of part of speech
(POS), arguing that POS tagsets should
be constructed more carefully and, in
effect, should be light in at least three
senses: 1) they should pay less heed
to the traditionally ill-defined notion of
POS, 2) they should adopt clear POS de-
limitation criteria based on solely for-
mal (morphological and morphosyntac-
tic) properties, and 3) tags should be as-
signed to light units, typically not longer
than orthographic words. A tagset for
Polish constructed on the basis of such
criteria is presented.

<bodyText confidence="0.998296272727273">
Morphosyntactic, or part of speech (POS), tagging
is often considered to be an uninteresting aspect of
natural language processing (NLP); after all, ro-
bust morphological analyzers and good-accuracy
disambiguators exist for many languages, while
the same cannot be said about, e.g., comprehen-
sive computational grammars or dialogue mod-
els.1 Even within corpus linguistics, morpholog-
ical annotation is considered a done deal, with
much annotation work focusing on higher levels of
*With apologies to Milan Kundera.
To avoid terminological confusion, we assume here that
a POS tagger has the combined functionality of a morpho-
logical analyzer (which may produce ambiguous results for
a given wordform) and a POS disambiguator (which selects
the &apos;right&apos; tag(s) for a given context).
linguistic representation (mainly syntax and, more
recently, semantics).
While there exist many morphological analyz-
ers for Polish and other Slavic languages which are
certainly useful and robust, we argue here that they
often are linguistically naïve, which has the prac-
tical consequence of being suited just for the one
specific task at hand. The main aim of this paper
is to argue for the need for a clear design of POS
tagsets on the basis of transparent morphosyntac-
tic criteria.
The following section, sec. 2, discusses vari-
ous features of current tagsets which seem prob-
lematic from the point of view of linguistic theory
and reusability. Then, section 3 presents a tagset
for Polish designed with the aim of avoiding those
problems. Finally, section 4 concludes the article.

2 Traditional POS Tagsets
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999462466666667">
Morphological classes, or parts of speech, as-
sumed within various tagsets are usually taken
over more-or-less verbatim from traditional gram-
mars. For example, the Multext-East (Erjavec,
2001) tagset for Czech assumes the following
parts of speech: noun, verb, adjective, pronoun,
adverb, adposition, conjunction, numeral, in-
terjection, residual, abbreviation and particle.
While tagsets based on such POSs are well-
grounded in linguistic tradition, they do not repre-
sent a logically valid classification of wordforms
in the sense that the criteria which seem to under-
lie these classes do not always allow to uniquely
classify a given word. We will support this criti-
cism with two examples.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.998502">

<bodyText confidence="0.977006">
Let us first of all consider the classes pronoun
and adjective. The former is morphosyntactically
very heterogeneous:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.993114125">
• some pronouns inflect for gender (e.g., the
demonstrative pronoun ten, the possessive
pronoun moj, but not the interrogative pro-
noun kto or the negative pronoun nikt);
• some pronouns (the so-called personal pro-
nouns), but not all, inflect for person;
• some pronouns, but not all, inflect for num-
ber (e.g., the pronouns kto &apos;who&apos; and co
&apos;what&apos; do not inflect for number);
• the short reflexive pronoun sic does not
overtly inflect at all, although it may be con-
strued as a weak form of the anaphoric pro-
noun siebie;
• the anaphoric pronoun siebie overtly inflects
for case only and it is the only pronoun with
such morphosyntactic properties.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999884291666667">
It seems that the class of pronouns is defined
mainly, if not solely, on the basis of semantic in-
tuition. On the other hand, adjectives are well-
defined morphosyntactically, as the forms inflect-
ing for gender, number and case, but not, say,
person or voice.
Now, according to these definitions, it is not
clear, whether so-called possessive pronouns, such
as moj &apos;my&apos; should be classified as pronouns or
adjectives: semantically they belong to the for-
mer class, while morphosyntactically — to the lat-
ter. (Traditionally, it is classified as a pronoun, of
course.)
A very similar problem arises in case of so-
called ordinal numerals, e.g., trzeci &apos;third&apos;, which
are morphosyntactically indistinguishable from
ordinary adjectives and which, nevertheless, are
traditionally classified as numerals, not as adjec-
tives.
Another, and perhaps more serious example
concerns so-called -nie/-cie gerunds, i.e., substan-
tiva verbalia (Puzynina, 1969) such as pi6::picie
&apos;to drink: :drinking&apos;, browsowa(::browsowanie &apos;to
browse: :browsing&apos; .2 These are nominal forms in
the sense that they have gender (always n2) and
inflect for case and, potentially, for number, but
they are also productively related to verbs, have
the category of aspect and inflect for negation.
As such, they do not comfortably fit into the tradi-
tional class noun, whose members do not have as-
pect or negation, nor do they belong to the class
verb, whose members have no case. A similar
difficulty is encountered also in case of adjectival
participles, which — apart from the adjectival in-
flectional categories of gender, number and case
— also inflect for negation and have aspect.
All those problems stem from the uncritical
adoption of traditional and sometimes ill-defined
POS classes, such as &apos;pronoun&apos; or vaguely delim-
ited classes such as &apos;verb&apos; or &apos;noun&apos;, and from the
fact that POS classes and categories are often cho-
sen on the basis of a mix of morphological, syntac-
tic and semantic criteria, e.g., &apos;gender&apos; in Slavic
is sometimes defined on the basis of mixed mor-
phosyntactic and semantic properties, and so are
&apos;pronoun&apos; and &apos;numeral&apos;. Apart from those, we
have identified some other problems with tradi-
tional approaches to POS tagging:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.988328470588235">
• mixing morphosyntactic annotation with
what might be called dictionary annotation;
e.g., tagsets often include tags for proper
names or morphosyntactically transparent
collocations, which — in our opinion — do
not belong to the realm of POS annotation;
• sometimes the priorities of such mixed cri-
teria are unclear, e.g., should the preposition
of in District of Columbia be tagged as an
ordinary preposition, or should it have the
&apos;proper&apos; tag as it is a part of a proper name?
• ignoring the finer points of the morphosyn-
tactic system of a given language, e.g.,
the multitude of genders in languages such
as Polish, or categories such as &apos;post-
prepositionality&apos; and `accommodability&apos; (see
below);

<listItem confidence="0.977266210526316">
• unclear segmentation rules (should so-called
analytic tenses or reflexive verbs be treated as
single units for the purpose of annotation?);
segmentation rules are often ignored in de-
scriptions of tagsets, even though, as we ar-
gue at length in section 3.1 below, they are
integral and often crucial part of tagset de-
sign.
In this paper we argue for a clear delimitation
of morphosyntactic tagging, where morphosyntac-
tic tagsets are based only on well-defined morpho-
logical criteria. Such tagsets are &apos;light&apos; in at least
three senses:
• they partially evade the burden of linguistic
tradition;
• they ignore semantic, pragmatic and — to a
large extent — syntactic information;
• tags are assigned to very light units, typically
single orthographic words.

<bodyText confidence="0.99974775">
The remainder of the paper presents such a
tagset for Polish, developed within a Polish cor-
pus project3 and deployed by a stochastic tagger
of Polish (Debowski, 2003).

The tagset presented in this section is based on the
following design assumptions:

• what is being tagged is a single orthographic

thereof; multi-word constructions, even those

considered by a different level of process-
ing ;4 cf. 3.1;

form inflects; e.g., nouns inflect for case,
but not for gender) and morphosyntactic (in
which categories it agrees with other forms;
e.g., Polish nouns do not inflect for gen-
der but they agree in gender with adjectives
and verbs); semantic criteria are eschewed;

3.1 Segmentation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999696">
By segmentation, or tokenization, we mean the
task of splitting the input text into tokens, i.e., seg-
ments of texts which are subject to morphosyntac-
tic tagging. Such tokens must minimally have the
following two properties:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9999485">
• tokens must be contiguous;
• tokens must be disjoint.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9996133">
These assumptions seem trivial, but when taken
seriously, they turn out to have some interesting
consequences.
In case of inherently reflexive verbs, such as bae
sic &apos;to be afraid&apos;, the reflexive marker (RM) sic
is sometimes analyzed as being a morphological
part of the reflexive verb, i.e., according to such
a view, the complex bao sic should have just one
tag assigned. This, however, would violate the dis-
jointness property above, as (1) illustrates.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.825456">
(1) Boje sie glogno rozegmiae.
fear-rv-I RM loudly laugh-infrv
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.971030111111111">
&apos;I&apos;m afraid to laugh loudly.&apos;
This sentence exemplifies the so-called haplology
of the Polish reflexive marker (Kupá, 1999): just
one reflexive marker sic occurs with two inher-
ently reflexive verbs: bojc sic and rozainiac&lt; sic.
If inherently reflexive verbs were to be segmented
jointly with their reflexive markers, the tokenizer
would have to interpret whether sic is part of the
&apos;word&apos; bojc sig, or the &apos;word&apos; rozes&apos;mia6 sic.5
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.5667735">
5Because of the criterion of contiguity it would have to
choose the former alternative in this case.
</footnote>
<page confidence="0.996163">
111
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999988307692308">
Thus, it seems reasonable to tokenize the reflex-
ive marker separately, and to interpret it at a level
aware of such linguistic phenomena as haplology.
Of course, splitting reflexive marker from the
corresponding inherently reflexive verb is also re-
quired to satisfy the criterion of contiguity: in Pol-
ish, the reflexive marker may be separated from
the verb by an in principle unlimited number of
words. A purer case of an application of the dis-
jointness criterion is the haplology of full-stop,
where the sentence-final dot may also be an in-
herent part of an abbreviation which happens to be
the last word in this sentence:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.757434">
(2) Widzialem Tomka, Janka itp.
saw-I Tom, John etc.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.8996734">
&apos;I saw Tom, John, etc.&apos;
The two criteria mentioned above still leave
much room for maneuver. In order for the result
of segmentation to be maximally transparent, we
propose the following guidelines:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.98892375">
• tokens do not contain white space;
• tokens either are punctuation marks or do not
contain any punctuation marks;
• an exception to the previous guideline are
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.860554307692308">
certain words containing the hyphen (e.g.,
Daimler-Benz, mass-media, s-ka = an abbre-
viation of spolka &apos;company&apos;, etc.) and apos-
trophe used when inflecting foreign names
(e.g. Lagrange&apos;a); they are given by a list.
Note that it does not follow from the guide-
lines above that orthographic words cannot be fur-
ther split into POS tokens, but — again — the
cases where such intra-word segmentation occurs
should be well-defined.
We propose to split orthographic words when
they contain what sometimes is called mobile or
floating inflection:

<table confidence="0.952478333333333">
(3) Dawno nie widzialam Janka.

&apos;I haven&apos;t seen John for a long time.&apos;
Dawnom nie widziala Janka.

<bodyText confidence="0.929330952380952">
&apos;I&apos;d go there once.&apos;
b. Kiedy bym tam poszedl.
It is clear that in the b. examples above, the de-
tached morphemes -m (bearing person and number
information) and bym (i.e., the subjunctive parti-
cle by and the bound morpheme -m) play the same
role as in the corresponding a. examples.
While the example in (3b) can be considered
dated and hard to spot in real texts, there are Pol-
ish sentences where the detachment of movable in-
flection from the verb is obligatory:
(5) Chcialbym, kbyg przyszedl.
would like-I that-you come
&apos;I&apos;d like you to come.&apos;
Even though there are only a few words (eby,
aby, gdyby, ...) that occur in such constructs, sen-
tences of this type are quite common
The &apos;floating inflections&apos; in Polish should be
treated as weak forms of the verb byo. These are
the same forms as the one in the following sen-
tence (Saloni and widzifiski, 1998):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.993766">
(6) Swiniag!
pig be-you
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.975973">
&apos;You&apos;re a pig!&apos;
In fact, such floating inflections have been re-
analyzed in recent linguistic literature as auxil-
iaries, i.e., essentially syntactic elements (Borsley
and Rivero, 1994; Bafiski, 2000).6 For these rea-
sons, we propose to tokenize orthographic word-
forms such as poszedtbym into three POS tokens:
poszedl, by and in. This in effect means that, for
Polish, segmentation must be treated as an inher-
ent part of morphological analysis.7
Arguments can also be given for splitting
the negative prefix nie from participles, despite
orthographic tradition, because they play the
same morphosyntactic role as the verbal negative
marker nie, e.g., participate in negative concord
(Przepiorkowski and Kupge, 1999) and trigger the

cessing.

However, as argued in (Kupge and
Przepiorkowski, 2002), Polish verbal nega-
tion should rather be treated as verbal prefixation,
contrary to what Polish orthography suggests, so
for the purposes of the tagset presented here, we
assume that negated participles are single tokens,
distinguished from their non-negated counterparts
via the morphological category of negation.

3.2 Morphological Categories
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.990286444444444">
Although we proposed ignoring some information
often present in tagsets, e.g., the &apos;proper noun&apos; vs.
&apos;common noun&apos; distinction, we argue that mor-
phological categories should be taken seriously
and should be as detailed as possible. For this rea-
son, apart from the traditional categories of gen-
der, person, number, case, degree and aspect,
we assume the following less-standard grammati-
cal categories:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.994895357142857">
• negation: a category of various de-verbal
classes, e.g., participles such as (nie)piszqcy
`(not) writing&apos;; the relavant values are aff and
neg;
• accentability (Polish: akcentowok): a cate-
gory of nominal pronouns; akc (jego), nakc
(go);
• post-prepositionality (Polish: poprzy-
irnkowos&apos;e): a category of nominal pronouns;
praep (niego, -fi), npraep (jego, go);
• agglutination (Polish: aglutynacyjnak):
nagl (nios1), agl (nios1-);
• vocability (Polish: woka1iczno§6): wok
(-em, -es), nwok (-m, -so.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998565625">
Those categories, although non-standard, are
based on important work by Zygmunt Saloni
and his colleagues (Saloni, 1976; Saloni, 1977;
Gruszczynski and Saloni, 1978; Bien and Saloni,
1982).
For completeness, the values of the more tra-
ditional grammatical categories are presented be-
low:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9999886">
• number: sg, pl;
• case: nom, acc, gen, dat, inst, loc, voe;
• person: pri, sec, ter;
• degree: pos, comp, sup;
• aspect: imperf, per!;
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.8186805">
The one traditional category ommitted above is
gender:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.998475666666667">
• gender: three masculine genders ml (facet),
m2 (koti), m3 (st61), the feminine gender f
(kobieta, Zyrafa, ksiqZka), two neuter genders
n1 (dziecko), n2 (okno), and three plurale
tantum genders pl (wujostwo), p2 (drzwi),
p3 (okulary).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.992666230769231">
It may seem surprising, at first, to see 9 gender
values in an Indo-European language (as opposed
to, say, a Bantu language), but this position is well
argued for by (Saloni, 1976), who distinguishes
those genders on the basis of agreement with ad-
jectives and numerals;8 we will not attempt to fur-
ther justify this position here.
8Elsewhere, we propose reducing the number of gen-
ders, essentially, by factoring out the number information
(Wolinski, 2001) or the information about agreement with nu-
merals (Przepiorkowski et al., 2002), but for the purposes of
this tagset we assume the original repertoire of genders pro-
posed by Saloni.

3.3 Morphological Classes
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999960606060606">
For the reasons amply discussed in section 2, and
following the general approach of (Saloni, 1974)
and (Bien, 1991), we propose to derive the notion
of grammatical class from the notion offlexeme in-
troduced by Bien, where flexeme is understood as
a morphosyntactically homogeneous set of forms
belonging to the same lexeme.
For example, a typical Polish verbal lexeme
contains a number of personal forms, a number
of impersonal forms, as well as, depending on
a particular understanding of the notion of lex-
eme, various deverbal forms, such as participles
and gerunds. These forms have very different
morphosyntactic properties: finite non-past tense
forms have the inflectional categories of person
and number, adjectival participles have the inflec-
tional properties of non-gradable adjectives and,
additionally, inflect for negation and have aspect,
gerunds inflect for case and, at least potentially, for
number, but not for person, etc. Ideally, flexemes
are subsets of such lexemes consisting of those
forms which have the same inflectional proper-
ties: all verbal forms of given lexeme with the
inflectional category of person and number are
grouped into one flexeme, other forms belong-
ing to this lexeme, but with adjectival inflectional
properties, are grouped into another flexeme, those
forms, which inflect for case but not for gender
are grouped into a gerundial flexeme, etc. Each of
such flexemes is characterized by a set of gram-
matical categories it inflects for and, perhaps, a set
of grammatical categories it has lexically set (e.g.,
the gender of nouns).
Now, given the notion of flexeme, it is natural
to define grammatical classes as flexemic classes,
i.e., classes of flexemes with the same inflec-
tional characteristics. For example, the grammat-
ical class non-past verb contains exactly those
flexemes which inflect for person and number,
and nothing else, and which also have the lexi-
cal category of aspect; the class noun contains ex-
actly those flexemes which inflect for number and
case, and have gender; the class gerund contains
exactly those flexemes which inflect for number,
case and negation, and have lexical gender (always
neuter, n2, in case of gerunds) and aspect; etc.
It should be noted that, despite the way flex-
emes have been defined above, the notion of lex-
eme is of only secondary importance here: it is
invoked for the purpose of assigning a lemma to a
given form (e.g., a gerundial form such as przyjs&apos;-
ciem &apos;coming-ins(&apos; will be lemmatized to the in-
finitival form przyjs&apos;o &apos;to come&apos;: even though the
form przyjk. does not belong to the flexeme of
przyjkiem, it does belong to the lexeme containing
przyjkiem). Moreover, just as in case of decid-
ing whether two forms belong to the same lexeme,
also classification of two wordforms to the same
flexeme requires some semantic intuition: thus,
e.g., pies `dog-nom&apos; and psem &apos;clog-insr belong
to the same (f)lexeme, and so do rok &apos;year-sg&apos; and
lata `year-pl, but pies &apos;dog&apos; and suka &apos;bitch&apos; do
not.
The basic classification of flexemes into gram-
matical (&apos;flexemic&apos;) classes is given by the follow-
ing decision tree:
</bodyText>
<tableCaption confidence="0.7381805">
Inflects for case?
YES: Inflects for negation?

YES: 1. adjectival participle

NO: 9. (&apos;non-inflecting&apos; verbal
forms, adverbs, prepositions,
conjunctions)
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.999881666666667">
Note that most of the classes in the &apos;inflects
for case&apos; branch of the tree already are reason-
able POSs, i.e., they correspond to traditional
POSs (noun, adjective, numeral) or to their well-
defined subsets (nominal pronoun, gerund, ad-
jectival participle). It is important to realize,
however, that these classes are defined mainly on
the basis of the inflectional properties of their
members; e.g., the class numeral is much nar-
rower here than traditionally, as it does not include
so-called ordinal numerals (which, morphosyntac-
tically, are adjectives).
On the other hand, in the &apos;does not inflect for
case&apos; branch, only the &apos;inflects for gender&apos; class
corresponds to an intuitive set of forms, namely, to

<table confidence="0.597948714285714">
8. Has a ter (i.e., 3rd person) form?
YES: 8.1. non-past forms, e.g., idp
&apos;I am going&apos;, pajde &apos;I will go&apos;
NO: Has a prisg form?
YES: 8.2. agglutinate
( - (e)m , -(e)a, -arny,
NO: 8.3. imperative
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.99941675">
Further, we will remove from the class of nouns
the flexeme of the strong reflexive pronoun siebie,
which does not inflect for number and does not
have overt gender:
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.647578" genericHeader="method">
6. Inflects for number?
</sectionHeader>
<construct confidence="0.4106085">
YES: 6.1. true noun
NO: 6.2. siebie
</construct>
<bodyText confidence="0.85002384375">
Moreover, inflectional class marked as 9. can
be further split according to non-inflectional mor-
phosyntactic properties of its members in the fol-
lowing way:
9. Has aspect?
YES: 9.1. non-inflecting verbal forms
NO: Inflects for degree or derived
from adjective?
YES: 9.2. adverb
NO: 9.3. preposition, conjunction,
etc.
Note that, in order to arrive at a class close to the
traditional class of adverbs, we had to define this
class disjunctively; it should contain all adverbs
inflecting for degree, at least one of which does
not seem to be derived from an adjective (bardzo
&apos;very&apos;), as well as all de-adjectival adverbs, some
of which do not (synthetically) inflect for degree
(e.g., antywirusowo &apos;anti-virus-like&apos;, *antylvirlj-
sowiej).
If our purpose were to define a purely flexemic
tagset for Polish, we would have to stop here (and
remove the &apos;derived from adjective&apos; disjunct from
the subtree above). For example, it is impossible
to distinguish the impersonal -no/-to form, the in-
finitive, and adverbial participle of the same lex-
eme on the basis of their morphosyntactic prop-
erties alone: they all lack any inflectional cate-
gories and have the lexical category of aspect. For
this reason, we will further partition the class 9.1.
above on the basis of purely orthographic (or pho-
netic) information:
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.556093">
9.1. Ends in -no or -to?
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.977485142857143">
YES: 9.1.1. impersonal -no/-to forms
(e.g., chodzono &apos;one used to
walk/go&apos;, pito &apos;one used to
drink&apos;)
NO: Ends in -qc or -szy?
YES: 9.1. 2. adverbial participle
(e.g., czytajac &apos;reading&apos;,
przeczytawszy &apos;having read&apos;)
NO: 9.1. 3. infinitive form (e .g. ,
ise &apos;to go&apos;) ; should end
in -c or -a
Finally, the class 9.3. consists of those word-
forms which do not inflect, and do not have as-
pect, i.e.:
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.729352">
9.3.1. conjunction
9.3.2. preposition
9.3.3. particle-adverb
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.999789857142857">
The first two classes are closed classes, which can
be defined extensionally, by enumerating them.
All other non-inflecting, non-aspectual and non-
de-adjectival single-form flexemes fall into the
particle-adverb class.
The full tagset is presented in (Przepiorkowski
and Wolinski, 2003).

4 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999896333333333">
We argued above for a &apos;light&apos; approach to POS
tagging, where POS tags reflect solely mor-
phosyntactic information, without paying any
heed to semantic and pragmatic information. This
approach leads to well-defined POS classes with
clear tests of being a member of a class based,
first of all, on inflectional properties of particu-
lar forms and, secondly, on other morphosyntactic
and orthographic/phonetic features. We included
a detailed feasibility study showing that this ap-
proach is well-suited to Polish, a Slavic language
with rich morphology. Despite this &apos;lightness&apos;, the
morphosyntactic information in the tagset we ar-
rived at is more detailed in most, if not all, tagsets
for Polish.
This approach may be difficult to accept from
the point of view of linguistic tradition (hence the
title of this paper), as it does not allow to define
classes such as &apos;pronoun&apos; or &apos;numeral&apos; in the tra-
ditional sense of these terms. We claim, however,
that this is a feature of our approach, not a bug: the
traditional notions &apos;pronoun&apos; and &apos;numeral&apos; are se-
mantic in nature and should be confined to the se-
mantic level of processing.

(Traditionally, it is classified as a pronoun, of course.) A very similar problem arises in case of socalled ordinal numerals, e.g., trzeci &apos;third&apos;, which are morphosyntactically indistinguishable from ordinary adjectives and which, nevertheless, are traditionally classified as numerals, not as adjectives. Another, and perhaps more serious example concerns so-called -nie/-cie gerunds, i.e., substantiva verbalia (Puzynina, 1969) such as pi6::picie &apos;to drink: :drinking&apos;, browsowa(::browsowanie &apos;to browse: :browsing&apos; .2 These are nominal forms in the sense that they have gender (always n2) and inflect for case and, potentially, for number, but they are also productively related to verbs, have the category of aspect and inflect for negation. As such, they do not comfortably fit into the traditional class noun, whose members do not have aspect or negation, nor do they belong to the class verb, whose members have no case.
