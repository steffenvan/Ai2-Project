I am writing in response to Varol Alcman&apos;s review (Computational Linguistics, 25(1):161-
164, March, 1999) of Survey of the State of the Art in Human Language Technology, of which
I was editor-in-chief. Akman makes three points:

<listItem confidence="0.997333166666666">
1. The HLT Survey does not succeed as a towering reference work on
human language technology, much as the Companion to the Philosophy of
Mind is in its own field.
2. Many or most of the sections are too superficial, nontechnical, and/or of
poor quality.
3. The HLT Survey is disproportionately skewed to references, glossary, etc.

When form and formality are stripped away, a scientific publication is often much
like a letter to a friend. The letter is based on shared knowledge, language, and expe-
rience. It is meaningful to the intended audience but makes little sense to strangers.
Akman&apos;s comments make sense if the HLT Survey is viewed as a letter to friends. If
it had been addressed to fellow HLT researchers and presented itself as an in-depth
examination of research issues, it would surely be a superficial treatment. But un-
like most scientific publications, the HLT Survey was addressed to strangers. As the
foreword explains, &amp;quot;the goal of the survey is to provide an interested reader with an
overview of the field—the main areas of work, the capabilities and limitations of cur-
rent technology, and technical challenges that must be overcome to realize the vision
of graceful human computer interaction using natural communication skills.&amp;quot;
The HLT Survey was created to provide a free, accessible, comprehensive, and use-
ful resource to anyone interested in learning about the theory, practice, capabilities,
and limitations of language technology. The editorial board identified the target audi-
ence as &amp;quot;intelligent, interested readers,&amp;quot; a list that includes teachers, students, industry
managers, bus drivers, and circus clowns.
To provide the most benefit to the most people, the editorial board decided to
make the book available free of charge via the Web. To my knowledge, there are no
constraints whatsoever on use of the book. You can download it and use it in your
courses to make friends of strangers.
To insure that the book would be intelligible and useful to a global audience,
authors were instructed to follow a common template: define the research area, de-
scribe the state of the art, describe the main theoretical or experimental approaches,
and identify key research challenges. Authors were limited to four or five pages, were

encouraged to include descriptive figures, and were instructed to write to an inter-
ested, intelligent novice in the field. The editorial board worked hard to insure a
consistent level of discourse to achieve the goals of a useful readable volume. These
constraints were intended to produce a set of chapters understandable by novices (and
consequently superficial to experts). The decision was also made to include a glossary
to introduce unfamiliar terms to newcomers and plenty of references for interested
readers.
Is the HLT Survey a useful resource? It is certainly a popular one. During the past
four months (March 1999 to July 1999), 7,600 unique machines were served over 65,000
pages from the survey&apos;s Web site, or about 500 pages per day. During this period, the
main HLT Survey page was accessed over 2,700 times by different machines in 60
countries. From these statistics, I infer that the HLT Survey is the most comprehensive
and widely read overview of the field of human language technology today. It is being
used as a textbook in several institutions, and was awarded the 1997 International Prix
Logos by L&apos;Association Europeenne des Linguistes et des Professeurs de Langues.
Clearly, Akman and I have different opinions about the value of the HLT Survey.
For example, I do not believe any sections are of poor quality. But please don&apos;t take
my word for it. The good news is that, since the HLT Survey is a free resource, it costs
just a bit of your time to visit the Web site (http://cslu.cse.ogi.edu/HLTsuryey/) and
form your own opinion. If you like it, tell your friends and students so they can enjoy
it too. After all, it&apos;s free.
