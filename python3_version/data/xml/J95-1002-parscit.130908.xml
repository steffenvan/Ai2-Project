Natural language provides an extensive set of lexical and grammatical forms for expressing
concepts, a set from which writers choose the particular form that they feel will produce the most
effective expression given the communicative context. An important task of the text generation
researcher is to specify both the range of these forms and the contexts in which they are used. This
paper addresses this issue in the context of the expression of procedural relations between actions
in instructional text. It employs the following four-step approach to achieve this goal: (1) collect a
corpus of the relevant text type; (2) perform a detailed linguistic study of a portion of this corpus,
called the training set, and reserve the remainder as a testing set; (3) implement the results of
this study in a text generation system; and (4) compare the output of the system with the text
found in the entire corpus. This has resulted in the construction of IMAGENE, an instructional
text generation system that embodies a model of the forms of expression consistently used by
instructional text writers over a broad range of instruction types. The details of IMAGENE&apos;S
treatment of purpose expressions are given as representative of the coverage and form of the full
system.

1. Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999758769230769">
Natural language provides an extensive set of lexical and grammatical forms for ex-
pressing concepts, many of which may, taken out of context, appear to be interchange-
able. They are not interchangeable. Writers systematically choose the particular form
from this set that they feel will produce the most effective expression given the com-
municative context. An important task of the text generation researcher is to inform
the text generation process with a specification of both the range of these forms and
the contexts in which they are used.
The current study addresses this issue in the context of expressing procedural
relations between actions in instructional text, that is, in written, procedural directions.
The complexity of procedural relations typically expressed in such text has given rise
to complex variations of expression in language. Consider, for example, the problem
of expressing purpose relations. Such expressions could take many conceivable forms,
all of which are perfectly grammatical:

As can be seen, purpose expressions occur either before or after the expression of
their related sub-actions (referred to here as the issue of slot) and are expressed in a
number of grammatical forms (the issue of form). They may be linked with a variety of
conjunctions or prepositions (the issue of linker) and may or may not be combined into
a single sentence with the expression of their sub-actions (the issue of clause combining).
The current study addresses these four issues of choice in the context of instructional
text.
Text generation systems must know which forms to produce and when to produce
them. Formal linguistic analyses are useful for weeding out grammatically unaccept-
able forms, but they do not provide a principled means of determining which of the
grammatically acceptable forms should be used in any given communicative context.
As an alternative, the current study has employed the following four-step process for
identifying both the relevant forms of expression and the contexts in which they are
used:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.935364545454546">
1. Collect a corpus of text from the relevant genre and encode a full range
of the lexical and grammatical features of all of the text.
2. Perform a linguistic analysis of part of the corpus. This analysis involves
determining the range of forms used in the corpus and then using an
iterative cycle of hypothesis formation and testing to determine the
communicative contexts in which each is used.
3. Implement the results of this analysis in the text generation system.
4. Compare, in detail, the output of the system with the text found in the
corpus, differentiating between the predictions concerning text that was
specifically used in the analysis (the training set) and text that was not
(the testing set).

<bodyText confidence="0.999701111111111">
This process begins and ends with the corpus, providing an empirically based
approach to identifying the range of lexical and grammatical forms that are used in
real text and to determining the contextual issues that are relevant to choosing among
them. Although the corpus study has become a common methodology in natural
language generation, seldom are the representation and analysis techniques given in
any detail, and detailed evaluations of the resulting text are not provided. These details
are provided, for our study, in this paper.
Our corpus is divided into training and testing portions. The training portion, used
in step 2, constitutes approximately one-third of the full corpus and consists entirely of

cordless telephone manuals. The methodology is successfully applied to this portion,
showing that there are, in fact, patterns of expression in cordless telephone manuals
that can be identified and implemented. The study is then extended by testing the
system&apos;s predictions on a separate and more diverse portion of the corpus that includes
instructions for different types of devices and processes. This additional testing serves
both to disallow over-fitting of the data in the training portion and to give a measure
of how far beyond the telephone domain the predictions can legitimately be applied.
No testing was done on noninstructional texts, and no claims are made concerning
the applicability of the system&apos;s predictions in those areas.
Following a review of relevant work in the area of natural language generation,
this paper will discuss how these four steps have been applied to the generation
of rhetorical relations in instructional text. It will detail what rhetorical relations in
instructional text are and how they were collected and represented. It will then discuss
how the corpus analysis was performed and how the results were implemented in
IMAGENE, an instructional text generation system. The details of IMAGENE&apos;S treatment
of purpose expressions are given as representative of the coverage and form of the full
system (more details concerning the other relations can be found elsewhere [Vander
Linden 1993c1). It will conclude with a discussion of how well imAGENE&apos;s predictions
match the text in the training and the testing portions of the corpus.

In pursuit of other issues, many studies have adopted a temporary solution to the
problem of managing diverse forms of expression, namely, that of choosing a single
lexical and grammatical form to express each of the relevant types of information dealt
with by the system. It is then a simple matter of allowing the type of information to
determine the appropriate expressional form. Hovy&apos;s text structurer (Hovy 1988b),
for example, uses rhetorical relations as defined in Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST)
(Mann and Thompson 1987) to order a set of propositions to be expressed. It does not
make any decision as to how a chosen relation is to be expressed, but rather leaves
this task to the rudimentary implementation of the rhetorical relations provided by the
Penman text generation system (Mann 1985). In the case of a purpose, for example,
Penman will produce a non-fronted in order to infinitive clause, as in the following
output of the structurer (Hovy 1988b, p. 167): &amp;quot;Knox is en route in order to rendezvous
with CTG 070.10.&amp;quot; A similar approach to expressing rhetorical relations was taken in
McKeown&apos;s TEXT system (McKeown 1985).
Text generators specifically designed for instructional text, such as Mellish and
Evans&apos; generator (Mellish and Evans 1989), EPICURE (Dale 1992), COMET (McKeown
et al. 1990), and TECHDOC (Rosner and Stede 1992b), display similar characteristics.
(See the analytical work of Delin, Scott, and Hartley [19931 for a notable exception to
this pattern.)
Mellish and Evans&apos; generator, for example, uses the output of NONLIN, a non-
linear planner (Tate 1976), as the preliminary rhetorical structure for the text. Because
this often produced text that was monotonous or hard to understand, they included
what was termed a message optimization phase that specifies rules for removing or
modifying certain elements of the plan structure that are known to produce poor text.
Although this greatly improves the text, it still tends toward text that is difficult to
read. This problem is, in part, due to the fact that some of the plans they look at are
quite complex and correspondingly difficult to express, but it is also attributable to
the lack of a detailed corpus study of the linguistic tools used by technical writers
in instructional text. The IMAGENE project can be seen as an extension of their work

that employs such a study to help manage diversity of forms of expression. There are
other natural language generation projects that have addressed similar issues. Two
such examples are Hovy&apos;s Pauline (Hovy 1988a) and Meteer&apos;s Spokesman (Meteer
1991, 1992), both of which are based, at least in part, on corpus studies.
Pauline produces an impressive range of expressional forms that are based on a
list of pragmatic features of the communicative environment, including information
about the conversational atmosphere, the speaker, the hearer, the relationship between
the two, and the interpersonal communicative goals of the speaker. Its construction
required a considerable amount of analysis of sample texts, but unfortunately, very
little is said about how this analysis was actually performed and how well the text
produced by Pauline matches the text in the corpus. The concerns of the IMAGENE
project are similar, except that both the text type (instructional text) and the linguistic
phenomenon (expressing rhetorical relations) are much more focused. The results of
our study are therefore more detailed, but also more constrained (see the concept
of domain communication knowledge, as described by Kittredge, Korelsky, and Rambow
[1991]).
In the Spokesman project, Meteer proposed an architecture for addressing what she
termed the problem of expressibility in text planning (Meteer 1992). Her fundamental
thesis is that an abstract linguistic representation is needed to provide the text planner
with information on constraints of expression (see Vaughan, and McDonald 1987).
Her constraints are taken, at least in part, from a study of text revisions made by
expert editors. The IMAGENE project concurs with this concern for detailed forms of
expression, but its methodology is geared toward determining the elements of the
communicative context used to choose between equally acceptable alternative forms
of expression. Meteer does not address what to do if, after using her constraints to
remove unacceptable forms of expression, there are a number of remaining acceptable
forms. This issue of choice is central to the current study.

3. Corpus Collection and Representation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.987078333333333">
The corpus developed for this study was taken from various types of instructional
text, including instruction booklets, recipes, and auto-repair manuals. It contains ap-
proximately 1000 clauses (6000 words) of instructions, taken from 17 different sources
representing a diverse array of process types. These sources include instructions for
electronic devices like cordless telephones and clock radios, manipulative processes
like auto repair and first aid, and creative processes like cooking and craft making.
The one common feature is that they all involve the expression of actions and of the
procedural relations between them.&apos; As an example of the nature of this text, consider
the following excerpt from the instructions for the GTE Airfone (Airfone 1991), which
will be called the Remove-Phone text:
(2) When instructed (approx. 10 sec.) remove phone by firmly grasping top
of handset and pulling out. Return to seat to place calls. (Airfone 1991)2

1 It should be noted that this corpus is much smaller than the language corpora used in larger statistical
studies (Church and Mercer 1993). The deep semantic and pragmatic knowledge that was required for
the current study has necessitated this.

This passage gives an example of the variation of expressional form that is common
in instructional text. It contains, among other things, two expressions of purpose:
&amp;quot;remove phone&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;to place calls.&amp;quot; This notion of purpose, which will be detailed
in the next section, is one of actions that are to be realized through the execution of
expressed sub-actions. The first is stated as an imperative (&amp;quot;remove the phone&amp;quot;), with
the sub-actions expressed in participial form within a by prepositional phrase (&amp;quot;by
firmly grasping top of handset and pulling out&amp;quot;). The second (&amp;quot;to place calls&amp;quot;), on the
other hand, is expressed in final position as a to infinitive, with its sub-action stated as
an imperative (&amp;quot;return to seat&amp;quot;). The problem to be addressed by the corpus analysis
in step 2 is to determine the contextual features used to choose these forms as opposed
to the alternate forms that could have expressed the &amp;quot;same basic information.&amp;quot;
A relational-style database is used to represent the rhetorical, grammatical, and
lexical aspects of the corpus. The representation of the grammatical form of the clauses
and phrases is based on traditional principles of syntax and semantics. Clauses and
phrases are represented in separate tables. Links within the clause table are used to
indicate subordinate relations, and links between the clause and phrase tables are
used to represent relative clauses and predicate—argument relations. It also includes
semantic information such as the agent of a particular action (e.g., the reader or the
device) and the semantic type of the predication (e.g., material or relational process).
More detail on the database can be found elsewhere (Vander Linden 1993c). The goal
was to allow for the representation of any element of the pragmatic, semantic, or
syntactic context that might be relevant in the analysis.
Mann and Thompson&apos;s RST has been used to encode the rhetorical relations be-
tween expressions in the corpus (Mann and Thompson 1987, 1988). It was developed
as a framework for describing text structure, viewed in terms of the semantic and
pragmatic relations that hold between text spans at all levels. The current study has
made use of five such relations: Purpose, Precondition, Result, Sequence, and Concur-
rent. This section will now make some general observations concerning RST, present
an example RST analysis of the Remove-Phone text, and conclude with definitions of
the relations used in the study.
RST distinguishes between what are called nucleus—satellite and multi-nuclear sche-
mata. The nucleus—satellite schema relates two spans of text: one designating a more
central span, called the nucleus, and a more peripheral one, called the satellite. This re-
lation is represented graphically with a directed arrow from the satellite to the nucleus.
Definitions of relations of this sort specify constraints that apply to the nucleus (N), the
satellite (S), and the combination of the two and specify the effects of the expression.
Purpose, Precondition, and Result are examples of such relations. The multi-nuclear
schema relates one or more spans, designating no span as superordinate or subor-
dinate to any other. Definitions of relations of this sort include specification of the
constraints on the nuclei and the combination of nuclei, as well as a specification of
the effect of the expression. The Sequence and Concurrent relations are such relations.
RST was attractive for the IMAGENE project because of its ability to represent the hi-
erarchical structure of text with rhetorical structures that matched the level of analysis
required for the study of expressions of procedural relations. There is considerable de-
bate in the field of discourse analysis concerning the relative importance of intentional
structure and rhetorical relations (e.g., Grosz and Sidner 1986; Moore and Pollack 1992),
most systems focusing on one or the other. The current study has conflated them, as
the instructional texts have not tended to display the complex intentional structure
common to persuasive texts and interactive discourses (Vander Linden 1993b).
Finally, RST has been used by many researchers for the purpose of text generation
(e.g., Moore and Paris 1988; Hovy and McCoy 1989; Scott and Souza 1990; Rosner

and Stede 1992a). This testifies not only to RST&apos;s usefulness, but also to the direct
applicability of the results of the current study to the field of natural language gen-
eration. Because of the common use of RST, the results can be more easily applied to
other work in this area. In particular, the focus on the precise forms of expression of
rhetorical relations in instructional text fills an important gap in current work (see the
work of Scott and Souza [1990] on expressing rhetorical relations).
Consider the application of RST to the Remove-Phone text. The first problem that
must be addressed in any RST analysis is the segmentation of the text into spans
that will serve as the atomic units of description. In RST, these spans have typically
been clauses, as is the case in the Remove-Phone passage, but certain phrases with
propositional content may be considered as well. The spans used in our analysis are
propositional units that express single actions. In the Remove-Phone text, there are six
such action expressions, listed here in segmented form:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999227833333333">
1. When instructed (approx. 10 sec.)
2. remove phone
3. by firmly grasping top of handset
4. and pulling out.
5. Return to seat
6. to place calls.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999635">
The second problem is one of relating these segments in the appropriate rhetorical
structure. The current study has used the two aspects of the RST specification that
can be mapped onto the procedural structure of the process being expressed, namely,
the hierarchical structure of RST and the subset of RST relations that correspond to
procedural relations. Each of these two aspects will be discussed with reference to the
RST representation for the Remove-Phone text, shown in Figure 1.3
The first aspect of this structure is its hierarchical nature. The procedural sequence
schema at the top of the text hierarchy, for example, indicates that there are two

3 The actual RST and grammatical analyses of the text were performed by one of the authors, and the
examples crucial to the formalization of the results were reviewed by both authors. This approach
would be difficult in the analysis of certain more complex texts such as persuasive texts, but proved to
be adequate in the study of local structure in instructional text.

spans of text that express a sequence of two actions. The spans themselves can be
expressed as single propositional units or as more complex spans, the latter being the
case with the two spans in this sequence. This is a representational manifestation of
the hierarchical nature of the processes themselves and is displayed graphically by
extending the horizontal line of a span to cover all of its subordinate spans. The RST
representation of the Remove-Phone text is a small portion of the full hierarchy that
represents the entire manual. The current study has focused on the expression of just
such local sub-trees; the problems of expression of macro-structure are beyond the
scope of the analysis (see Mooney, Carberry, and McCoy 1991).
The second aspect of this structure is the nature of the rhetorical relations them-
selves. The representation makes use of five relations: Purpose, Precondition, Result,
Sequence, and Concurrent, which are used as abstractions to identify the lexical and
grammatical manifestations of the procedural relations inherent in the process. They
are termed informational by Moore and Pollack (1992) and subject matter by Mann and
Thompson (1987) because they are based on semantic content rather than on inten-
tional or presentational content.&apos; This section will now provide specific definitions of
these relations.

The Purpose relation is taken directly from the RST specification. In this paper, it

4.2 The Context of Expression
The second task, that of determining the functional context in which each of the forms
is used is more difficult. The IMAGENE project employs a hypothesis generation and
test cycle, such as the one advocated by Cumming (1990) in an attempt to identify
correlations between the contextual features of communicative context on the one
hand, and the lexical and grammatical forms on the other.
This methodology starts with the range of lexical and grammatical forms corre-
sponding to each of the rhetorical relations considered. In the hypothesis phase, the
analyst hypothesizes a feature of the communicative context that appears to correlate
with the variation of some aspect of the lexical and grammatical forms. These hy-
potheses may come from an intuitive analysis of the texts, as well as from the current
literature on the subject. The features themselves pertain to any of three aspects of the
communicative context (termed metafunctions in systemic linguistics): Ideational—the
propositional meaning of the material being expressed (associated with the traditional
notion of semantics); Textual—the flow and structure of the text (associated with dis-
course analysis); and Interpersonal—the human relationships between interlocutors
(associated with socio-linguistics) (Halliday 1985). All of these types of features have
proven relevant in the analysis. In the test phase, the analyst attempts to validate the
hypothesis by querying the database for the relevant information. These two phases
are repeated until a good match is achieved or until a relevant hypothesis cannot be
found.
As an example of this methodology, consider the issue of slot, that is, the deter-
mination of which span in a rhetorical relation should be expressed first. The slot of

purpose expressions in our corpus is split fairly evenly between initial and final pur-
pose expressions. Of the 119 purpose expressions, approximately 48% are fronted and
52% are not fronted. These values are similar to the percentages of initial and final
purpose clauses found by Thompson (1985) for procedural texts. Although she reports
just over 18% initial purpose clauses for English text in general, she reports 49% initial
purpose clauses for a book of recipes and 34% for an auto-repair manual.
Thompson&apos;s study indicated that one common feature of fronted purpose clauses
is that their scope is global, that is, there is more than one expressed proposition that
is directly related to the fulfillment of the purpose (e.g., &amp;quot;To achieve purpose A, do
B and do C.&amp;quot; where there are two sub-actions, B and C). Such a purpose clause is
expressing a context in which the prescribed sub-actions are to be interpreted and
thus should be fronted. This provides a good starting hypothesis for determining the
slot of purposes, namely, that global purpose clauses are fronted. Upon inspection,
we find that only three cases of global purpose expressions in our corpus (7.9%) are
not fronted. This yields strong support for the hypothesis and allows us to go on and
discern what factors motivated the counter-examples. This process continues either
until no distinctions can be found, or until there are not enough examples on which
to base the distinctions.
The next question to be asked is whether this is the only explanation of fronted
purpose expressions, or whether there are other fronted purpose expressions that are
not global. This can be addressed by querying all the fronted, non-global purpose
clauses in the corpus. In the current corpus, this set is non-empty, which leads to the
conclusion that there are other factors at work in the question of purpose slot. The
iterative process of hypothesis generation and testing can then be conducted on these
other cases in a similar manner.
This analysis technique is designed to identify covariation between elements of
the communicative context on the one hand and grammatical form on the other. The
purpose slot analysis just discussed, for example, identifies the existence of a covari-
ation between purpose scope and slot. This covariation, however, does not constitute
proof that the technical writer actually considers the issue of slot during the gener-
ation process, nor that the prescribed form is actually more effective than any other.
Proof of either of these issues would require psycholinguistic testing. This study pro-
vides detailed prescriptions concerning how such testing should be performed, i.e.,
what forms should be tested and what contexts controlled for, but it does not actually
perform the tests. A discussion of this may be found elsewhere (Vander Linden 1993a).

Penman, a sentence-level generator developed at the USC Information Sciences In-

of language (Halliday 1976). The Systemic view is distinctly functional, that is, it is
particularly interested in mapping elements of the communicative context onto the
appropriate grammatical forms. As a by-product of this view of language, Penman

contains a well-developed implementation of the System Network, the Systemic formal-
ism for representing grammar.
The system network is basically a decision network in which each choice point
distinguishes between alternative features of the communicative context. It has been
used extensively in Systemic Linguistics to address both sentence-level and text-level
issues (e.g., Berry 1981; Patten 1988; Fawcett 1990). Such networks are traversed based
on the appropriate features of the communicative context, and as a side effect of this
traversal, linguistic structures are constructed by realization statements that are associ-
ated with each feature of the network. Penman&apos;s networks are specifically designed
to construct English sentences.
IMAGENE&apos;s system network is built in a similar manner, but because it constructs
text structures rather than sentences, its realization statements have a flavor signifi-
cantly different from their counterparts in the grammar developed for Penman.&apos; We
now give a short discussion of how IMAGENE&apos;s realization statements can manipulate
the evolving text structure, making reference to the text structure produced by IMA-
GENE for the portion of the Remove-Phone text shown in Figure 3 (which corresponds
to the text span &amp;quot;... remove phone by firmly grasping top of handset and pulling
out&amp;quot;). The full analysis of the Remove-Phone text will be given later; here we intend
to illustrate only the types of manipulations made by the realization statements.

• Inserting nodes into the text structure (iterative-insert, insert,
copy)—ImAGENE starts with an empty text structure and uses these
statements to insert action nodes as appropriate. In Figure 3, for
example, the Remove-Action, Grasp-Action, and Pull-Action nodes refer
to the actions of removing, grasping, and pulling the handset.

text-level, there is no definitive list of what might be called text functions. Rather, IMAGENE&apos;s realization
statements allow the insertion of subscripted elements that can correspond to lists of sequential
commands, multiple preconditions, etc.

IMAGENE&apos;S network consists of approximately 70 systems. It maps those features of
the communicative context deemed relevant in the corpus analysis performed in step 2
onto the appropriate lexical and grammatical forms for expressing each action. The
network, having the basic high-level structure shown in Figure 4, performs the two
basic functions of Content and Rhetorical Status Selection and Grammatical Form Selection.
We view Content Selection as the process of choosing the appropriate actions from
the process plan to express and Rhetorical Status Selection as the process of choosing
the appropriate rhetorical relation to be used in expressing each of these actions. IMA-
GENE contains a sub-network implementing these two processes that is currently very
preliminary (Vander Linden 1993c).7 This paper focuses on the Grammatical Form Se-
lection portion of the network, that is, the choice, given an action to be expressed and
its rhetorical status, of the appropriate lexical and grammatical forms of expression.
We will present a detailed discussion of the purpose sub-network below, which is
representative of the other grammatical form sub-networks.

A high-level view of the systems in the network.
The input to IMAGENE is the set of features of the functional context that affect the
form of expression of the plan, called the text-level inquiries in Figure 2. This input is im-
plemented as a set of responses to the inquiries made by the IMAGENE system network
pursuant to determining the appropriate path to be taken through the IMAGENE system
network. They are analogous to Penman&apos;s sentence-level inquiries. Currently, the data
structures and code necessary to respond to the inquiries automatically have not been
implemented. Rather, the inquiries are answered manually, allowing us to focus on
determining the appropriate set of inquiries and the precise lexical and grammatical
consequences of the responses of these inquiries. The dashed lines in Figure 2 indicate
some of the information sources that the inquiry implementations will access (i.e., the
Process Structure, the Penman lexicon and grammar, and the evolving text structure).
As a side effect of traversing the network, IMAGENE&apos;s realization statements automati-
cally realize these consequences in a text structure (also shown in Figure 2). The Text
Structure, to be discussed more fully in Section 5.3, is represented in IMAGENE&apos;s Text
Representation Language (TRL). TRL itself is implemented in LOOM (MacGregor and
Bates 1987; Loom 1993).
A second input shown in Figure 2, the Process Structure, is a representation of
the process to be expressed. It is built in IMAGENE&apos;s Process Representation Language
(PRL), which is also implemented in LOOM and will also be discussed in Section 5.3.
It is a representation like that produced by a procedural planner, containing the pro-
cedural hierarchy of the process being expressed as well as some information about
the lexical items used to express each action and its arguments. It is currently built by
hand, which allows us to focus on the problem of expression rather than on planning.
As previously mentioned, the Process Structure will eventually become a funda-
mental source of procedural information for the text inquiries. Currently, however, it
is simply used by the final component of the architecture, the Sentence Builder, to
specify the appropriate lexical items and case structures for the action input to the
text-level inquiries. The Sentence Builder uses the lexical information given in the
Process Structure just described, to translate the Text Structure, described above, into
the appropriate sentence specification to be passed to Penman for surface realization.
This specification is coded in terms of Penman&apos;s Sentence Planning Language (SPL)
(Kasper 1989), a language that allows the specification of the lexical items and gram-

5.2 Purpose Relations in Instructional Text
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.987859">
Purpose expressions arise in the context in which actions are viewed as being related
hierarchically, that is, in which one higher level action is realized by the execution of
a set of lower level actions.8 As Section 4 indicated, there are a large number of lexical
and grammatical forms in which such procedural relations are typically expressed,
each used in a particular functional context. This section discusses the systems that
have been included in IMAGENE to distinguish among these contexts.
There are other studies of purpose expressions from the point of view of repre-
sentation and understanding that are of use here (Di Eugenio 1992; Balkanski 1992).
Di Eugenio, for example, has worked with by purposes and to infinitive (TNF) pur-
poses in the context of understanding, but does not appear to have distinguished the
Iwo forms in her analysis of the procedural relations between actions. The current
study is critically interested in discerning principled reasons for choosing between
these sorts of expressions.
The issues of slot and form of purpose expressions are treated largely indepen-
dently by IMAGENE. The slot is determined by the sub-network shown in Figure 5. The
form is determined by the sub-networks shown later in Figures 7 and 8. This portion
of the system network is capable of generating a greater range of purpose expressions
than is typical in generation systems and of identifying the functional reasons for
choosing one form over the other. It should be noted that while the determinations
made by the systems are based solely on the results of the corpus analysis conducted
in step 2, the following sections will include intuitive motivations for the realizations
the systems make.
5.2.1 Purpose Slot. The slot determination portion of the purpose sub-network, shown
in Figure 5, formalizes Thompson&apos;s notion of the &amp;quot;vastly different functions&amp;quot; for initial
and final purpose clauses (Thompson 1985) in the context of instructional text. It
typically places the purpose expression in the final position. The exceptions to this
are when the scope of the purpose is global, the purpose is considered optional, or
the purpose is considered contrastive. These three exceptions are handled by the three
systems depicted in Figure 5.9
The first exception, handled by the Scope system, concerns the number of ac-
tions pertained to by the purpose. This correspondence between global purposes and
fronted purpose expressions was already discussed in the corpus analysis section, but
to give an intuitive feel for this empirical result, consider the awkwardness of restating
example (3a) as &amp;quot;?? Hold down FLASH [6] for about two seconds, then release it to end
a previous call.&amp;quot;10 The restatement seems to imply, incorrectly, that the purpose applies

8 Goldman has termed these hierarchical relations generation relations (Goldman 1970). A detailed
discussion of them can be found elsewhere (Balkanski 1993; Di Eugenio 1993).
9 In the system network notation, vertical lines indicate decision points. The boldfaced names are
systems, the normal font names are features, and the italicized names are realization statements. The
ordering realization statements are denoted with the operators &gt; and 1, meaning order the clauses in
the same sentence and order the clauses in separate sentences, respectively. More detail on this
notation can be found elsewhere (Winograd 1983, ch. 6).
10 The &amp;quot;??&amp;quot; notation is used to denote a possible form of expression that is not typically found in our
corpus; it does not indicate ungrammaticality.

to the last action alone rather than to the sequence of actions. The fronted form, in
example (3a), makes no such implication.
As can be seen in Figure 5, the Global feature of the Scope system contains five re-
alization statements, all making changes to the evolving text structure. In the Remove-
Phone text, for example, these statements restructure or demote the Remove action in
the hierarchical structure shown in Figure 6A into a satellite node in the RST structure
shown in Figure 6B. They do not, however, actually contain the realization statement to
set the textual order of the purpose expression (which would read Purpose &gt; Nucleus);
later systems in this branch of the decision network execute this statement.
The remaining exceptions occur when the purpose is considered optional or con-
trastive and are handled by Optionality and Contrastiveness, respectively. Here are
examples of them from the corpus:

In example (4), the action of getting more information is optional, that is, the
reader may or may not want more information at this point in the text.&apos; The purpose
expression is therefore stated first to set the appropriate context for interpreting the
prescribed sub-action. In example (5), the purpose of ending a call is stated in contrast
to placing a call in the previous sentence. It is thus fronted to set the appropriate
context for the prescribed action. This fronting of contrastive purposes occurred in our
corpus in the context of three oppositional semantic situations: (1) initiating/ending;
(2) allowing/preventing; and (3) activating/deactivating.
The results of this study predict a number of cases in which purposes should
not be fronted, which is in contrast to the general claim made by Dixon (1987). He
claimed that purposes should always be fronted because this facilitates the top—down
construction of a procedural plan by readers as they progress through the text. Our
results show cases in which this rule is not followed by technical writers, that is, when
the purpose is neither global, optional, nor contrastive.

5.2.2 Purpose Form. The form selection sub-network, shown in Figures 712 and 8,
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.986153090909091">
determines the grammatical form of purpose expressions. The first element of the form
selection sub-network is Conditional-Status, which determines whether the high-level
purpose being expressed has special conditions pertaining to it, such as the expressed
precondition in example (6a) or other conditions that restrict the applicability of the
purpose, as in example (7a) (&amp;quot;to wall unit from which it was taken&amp;quot;). If so, either a by
purpose or an adjoined purpose expression is used, depending upon the complexity
of the resulting sentence as determined by Sentence-Complexity. The slot of these
forms is always initial and is determined here, rather than in the slot selection sub-
network just discussed. As was the case in our corpus, IMAGENE expresses purposes
that involve five or more propositions using the adjoined form and otherwise with
the by form. Consider the following examples of these situations:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.8837555">
(6a) When instructed (approx. 10 sec.) remove phone by firmly grasping top of
handset and pulling out. (Airfone 1991)

handset and pull out.
(7a) Return handset to wall unit from which it was taken. Insert heel first as

(7b) ?? Return handset to wall unit from which it was taken by inserting

In example (6a), there is a precondition on the high-level purpose of removing
the phone, a feature that correlates well with the use of the by form. Example (6b)

instructed.&amp;quot; In the second example, the by form would similarly be prescribed by

it was taken&amp;quot;), but the number of propositions in the resulting sentence, (7b), appears
to be too great (return, taken, insert, shown, push), forcing the use of the adjoined
form, (7a). The adjoined purpose form is an example of a case in which the rhetorical
structure of a text need not be explicitly signaled with a lexical or grammatical cue
(except textual order), called an &amp;quot;inferred connective&amp;quot; by Crothers (1979). RST allows
the representation of this situation because its relations are not defined in terms of
lexical and grammatical forms (Mann and Thompson 1987).
When a purpose does not have conditions upon it and the scope is global, Purpose-
TNF marks the purpose as a to infinitive (TNF). Example (3a) illustrated this. These
sorts of context-setting purposes are not demoted to phrase status. This reflects the
fact that global purposes are not expressed in phrasal form in our corpus.
The Volitionality system determines whether the purpose expresses the desire of
the reader to get some inanimate substance to perform in some volitional way. This
context usually leads to the use of the so that purpose, as shown in example (3g).
Quite often these substances are liquids, but may also include other inanimates. What
distinguishes liquids appears to be their ability to drip or drain over a period of time.
Consider the following alternate forms for expressing purpose:
(8a) Sit the person up leaning slightly forward so that blood and saliva can drain
from his mouth. (Rosenberg 1985) to allow blood
(8b) ?? Sit the person up leaning slightly forward in order
and saliva to drain from his mouth.
The form in example (8a) is more commonly used in our corpus in this context.

Nominalization systems of the purpose form system network.
Goal-Status determines whether the use of Goal Metonymy is warranted. The
term Goal is used here as a case relation, corresponding to what is also called theme
(Allen 1987). This metonymy occurs in purposes in which the direct object (or goal)
of the purpose clause is more important than the action, as in
(9) For frequently busy numbers, you&apos;ll want to use REDIAL [7], and the pause
will have to be in Redial memory. (Code-a-phone 1989)
The corpus study revealed that situations in which the full purpose would be
something like &amp;quot;to handle frequently busy numbers&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;for dealing with frequently
busy numbers,&amp;quot; tend to be expressed using this sort of ellipsis. The goal of the verb,
in this case the busy numbers, metonymically refers to the action as a whole.
The remainder of the form selection sub-network, shown in Figure 8, is capable
of generating three discrete points along the continuum from fully nominal to fully
verbal forms (Quirk et al. 1985), namely the nominalization, the gerund, and to infini-
tive. These are the forms that were present in our corpus. Nominal-Availability will
realize a prepositional phrase with a nominalization as the complement whenever the
appropriate nominalization exists, as in example (9a).&apos;
13 This analysis of nominalizations is an example of the descriptive nature of the current study of
instructional text. The descriptive observation has been made that when nominalized forms of a verb
exist in the lexicon, they tend to be used. A full explanatory account, in the spirit of current
Discourse-Functional studies (e.g., Matthiessen and Thompson 1987; Thompson 1987), would attempt
to identify the precise aspect of the action or the context of its expression that would dictate the use of
a nominalization, thus resulting in the development of a nominalized form in the English language.
Such an account is beyond the scope of the current study.

(Code-a-phone 1989)
This use of phrases with nominalizations as propositional units is common in
instructional text as well as in academic text (Cumming 1991) and formal text in
general (Hovy 1987). IMAGENE&apos;S architecture implements a particular interpretation of
Cumming&apos;s proposal (1991) that nominalizations be dealt with at two levels, one at
which the actions are not specified for nominal or clausal expression, and another in
which they are. IMAGENE&apos;S Process Structure can be seen as the former level, its Text
Structure as the latter.
Even if a nominalization exists, however, it still may not be used depending upon
the determination of Nominal-Arguments and Nominal-Complexity. These systems,
based on the examples in our corpus, restrict nominalizations to single, non-complex
arguments. Consider the following examples:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.993475857142857">
(10a) Use the VOL LO/HI [2] switch to adjust volume to your preferred listening
level. (Code-a-phone 1989)
(10b) ?? Use the VOL LO/HI [2] switch for volume adjustment to your preferred
listening level.
(11a) FLASH uses proper timing to avoid an accidental hangup. (Code-a-phone
1989)
(11b) ?? FLASH uses proper timing for accidental hangup avoidance.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.921929866666667">
In cases (10a) and (11a), taken from our corpus, there were nominalizations avail-
able, namely &amp;quot;adjustment&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;avoidance,&amp;quot; but neither was used. The adjustment
nominalization in (10b) was apparently not used because it required more than one
argument. The avoidance nominalization in (11b) appears to have been rejected be-
cause the argument &amp;quot;accidental hangup&amp;quot; was itself a nominalization and thus too
complex. In both cases, the to infinitive form was preferred.
If no nominalization is available, TNF-Arguments will produce the to infinitive
(TNF), unless the infinitive form requires the expression of redundant arguments. Here
is an example of this case:
(12a) The BATT LOW Light [9] comes ON when the battery is weak. The
handset must be returned to the base for recharging. (Code-a-phone 1989)
(12b) ?? The BATT LOW Light [9] comes ON when the battery is weak. The
handset must be returned to the base to recharge (the battery?).
Examples similar to (12a) were found in the corpus, whereas those similar to the
alternative to infinitive expression, (12b), were not.

that this structure is currently built by hand. It is assumed that it could be constructed
using artificial intelligence planning methodologies. Note also that the PRL structure,
in the various slots for each node, specifies the Penman lexical entries for most of the
lexical choice issues, thus allowing IMAGENE to concentrate on expressing procedural
relations.
Given this structural representation of a sequence of actions, the Content and
Rhetorical Status Selection system sub-network can be viewed as using the inquiry
responses to produce the TRL structure shown in Figure 10.15 Again, this process is
not the subject of this paper, but is mentioned to provide a more complete discussion
of the data structures involved.
The Grammatical Form Selection sub-networks can then be seen as operating on
the appropriate relations included in this representation and producing the full TRL
structure shown in Figure 11. TRL allows the Text Structure to include a representation
of the hierarchical structure of the text in terms of RST, including both nucleus—satellite
and multi-nuclear schemata. In addition, TRL specifies the textual order and clause
combining using additional New-Sentence and Continue-Sentence links. For example,
the Instruct, Grasp, Remove, and Pull nodes are all combined into one sentence in
Figure 11. Finally, TRL specifies the grammatical form of each action expression using
three features that may be attached to expressible nodes in the structure. The Form
feature specifies the general grammatical form. For example, the Instruct is marked as
Passive, indicating that the agentless passive should be used. The Linker and Tense
markers are also used to mark the appropriate linker and tense of the expression.
The Sentence Builder then uses a straightforward recursive descent algorithm to
produce an SPL command for each of the sentences in the TRL structure. The generated

phrasal differences, including the lexical items chosen for the object references and the
use of determiners. These differences arise from the fact that the current study has

5.4 More Examples of IMAGENE&apos;s Output
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999925">
This section includes examples of IMAGENE&apos;s output for the fundamental relations dealt
with in the current study, that is, Purpose, Precondition, Result, and action Sequence.
It is intended to demonstrate IMAGENE&apos;s breadth of coverage and will not discuss the
details of how the forms are motivated.
Given the choice to express an action, rhetorically, as a purpose, IMAGENE is capable
of producing seven grammatical forms for its expression, most of which can be either
fronted or not fronted. Here are the various forms, as generated by IMAGENE according
to the distinctions discussed in the previous section:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.997575375">
(14a) To end a call, hold down the FLASH button for two seconds, then release it.
(14b) Follow steps in the illustration for desk installation.
(14c) Use the OFF position for charging the batteries.
(14d) Use the REDIAL for frequently busy numbers.
(14e) When you are instructed, remove the phone by grasping the top of the handset
and pulling it.
(14f) Remove the phone. Grasp the top of the handset, and pull it.
(14g) Tilt the pan so that the fluid drains out.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9816015">
Given the choice to express an action, rhetorically, as a precondition, IMAGENE is
capable of producing four grammatical forms for its expression, all of which can be
either fronted or not fronted and also linked with various lexical items. Here are some
representative forms, as generated by IMAGENE:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9506238">
(15a) If light flashes, insert credit card.
(15b) The BATTERY LOW INDICATOR will light when the battery is low.
(15c) When the phone is installed, and the battery is _charged, move the
OFF/STBY/TALK switch to the STBY position.
(15d) Return the OFF/STBY/TALK switch to the STBY position after your call.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999986857142857">
There are two types of results that IMAGENE supports. The first type is non-reader
actions that are not the result of an explicit command to monitor a particular device
state. IMAGENE expresses this type of result as a future tense clause, as seen in exam-
ple (16a). The second type is not based on an action in the Process Structure at all,
but rather, is a span added by the system networks to signal a state resulting from an
expressed action. IMAGENE expresses these as present tense relational expressions, as
seen in example (16b). Here are examples of these forms:
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.957988666666667">
(16a) The BATTERY LOW INDICATOR will light when the battery is low.

Simple sequential actions do not fit into the categories discussed above and are
marked as imperative commands. These commands are combined into clauses by the
sentence tools system network using and when the concurrency that could be implied
is impossible or inconsequential, as in example (140, or then when there is possible
unwanted concurrency, as in example (14a).

6. Verifying IMAGENE&apos;s Prescriptions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999589138888889">
Finally, we compare the output of the text generator with the text in the corpus. For this
purpose, IMAGENE&apos;s system network was re-run for all of the approximately 600 action
expressions, both those from the training set and those from the testing set. Statistics
were kept on how well its realizations matched the expressions in the corpus.&apos; These
tests were performed without the Penman realization component engaged, comparing
the TRL output of the system network with the corpus text. This way, the extensive
lexicon that would have been necessary for the surface realization was not required.
IMAGENE currently includes a domain model and lexical entries for cordless telephones
and a few other specific examples.
The match was judged on four separate lexical and grammatical issues: linker,
form, slot, and clause combining. The resulting TRL structure had to specify the iden-
tical linker (either preposition or conjunction), form (tense, aspect, mood, and voice, or
non-finite verb or nominalization), slot (textual order), and combining (if the expres-
sion was combined with the following one). An example of this verification process
can be found in Section 5.3, in which the IMAGENE-produced Remove-Phone text is
shown to match the original text on all four of these issues.
Note that the match must be exact. For example, if IMAGENE specifies the con-
junction and for a sequence expression when then occurs in the text, the choice of
linker would be counted as incorrect, in spite of the fact that the resulting text might
be quite understandable. Note also that IMAGENE&apos;s realizations may even be better in
some cases than the text in the corpus. Although the general philosophy of the ap-
proach taken in the current study is to assume that the choices made by the writers
of the corpus are correct, there are isolated cases in which the forms in the corpus are
probably inappropriate. IMAGENE embodies choices that are consistently made over a
range of instructions and thus does not reflect isolated examples.
The analysis conducted in step 2 has been based primarily on a small subset of the
full corpus, namely on the instructions for a set of three cordless telephone manuals.
This training set constitutes approximately 35% of our corpus. The results of this
analysis were then implemented in IMAGENE and applied to the full corpus, providing
a detailed characterization of the instructions found in the original telephone manuals
and a quantitative analysis of how well this characterization applies to the other forms
of instructions. IMAGENE&apos;s realizations correctly match all four lexical and grammatical
issues in 71% of the expressions in the training set and 52% in the testing set. The
specific levels of match for the four most common rhetorical relations are detailed
in Figures 12 and 13. There is one table for each of the major rhetorical relations,
Purpose, Precondition, Result, and Sequence.&apos; These tables show the percentage of

16 The training corpus included some non-procedural text that was included for a pilot study done before
the focus on procedural text had been determined. It is not handled particularly well by IMAGENE, and
the results given in this section will not include it. The testing set is exclusively procedural and is
included in full.
17 Because there are relatively few concurrent expressions in our corpus, only 33, those results are not
included in this section.

The accuracy of imAGENE&apos;s realizations for Purpose and Precondition expressions.
IMAGENE&apos;S realizations for linker, form, slot, and clause combining that matched those
in the corpus, differentiating between the training set and the testing set. As can be
seen in all of the charts, the level of match is better for the training set, but still good
for the testing set.
For purpose expressions, IMAGENE makes use of four different linkers (by, for, so
that, and no linker) and six different forms (to infinitive, imperative, nominalization,
gerund, goal metonymy, and simple present tense action) and produces a match on all
four lexical and grammatical issues for 81% of the purpose expressions in the training
set and 59% in the testing set. Figure 12 gives a breakdown of IMAGENE&apos;s accuracy
for the four lexical and grammatical issues. To judge these results more fully, consider
an alternative system that always generates the single most common purpose form.
In our corpus, this is the fronted to infinitive, which occurred in 34% of the purpose
expressions.18 Such a system would score 34% under the verification criteria used here.
For precondition expressions, the most common form in our corpus is the fronted
if present tense clause, which occurred in 19% of the 98 precondition expressions in
the corpus. IMAGENE, which produces five linkers and nine forms, produces a match
for 67% of the precondition expressions in the training set and 35% in the testing set.
As can be seen in the precondition chart in Figure 12, IMAGENE&apos;S accuracy is lower for
preconditions than for purposes, particularly in the testing set. This reflects the greater
diversity of procedural contexts in which preconditions arise and the corresponding
diversity of the forms used to express them (see Vander Linden 1994). Certainly, a
larger training set is required here, but it is not clear at this point how much larger it
18 Table 1 indicates 32%, but that would be for our corpus with the non-procedural portions of text
included. They have been removed here to remain consistent with the statistics shown in this section.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999865">
This paper has addressed the problem of determining the precise lexical and gram-
matical forms for expressing procedural relations between actions in the context of
instructional text generation. The corpus-based methodology employed is well suited
for this problem, providing both a principled means for cataloging the lexical and
grammatical forms that are consistently used in instructional text and an environment
for testing and confirming hypotheses concerning the contextual issues that co-vary
with these forms.
The issues of procedural planning, user modeling, and content selection, although
of unquestionable importance to the broad goal of generating instructions, were not
specifically addressed here. The current study makes a number of prescriptions for the
type of information that such techniques would need to provide to the text planner
pursuant to the generation of instructional text, but says nothing about how they
should be implemented in order to achieve this.
There are two fundamental contributions of the current study to the field of com-
putational linguistics. The first is the analysis of insquctional text itself. The current
study has provided a characterization of certain aspe-cts of instructional text that has
been effectively applied to the generation of instructional text in general. This char-
acterization is directly applicable to current work on instructional text, particularly in
the context of natural language generation. The results can also serve as a source of
preliminary hypotheses with respect to the analysis of other related genres.

The second is the detailed presentation of a methodology for managing diversity of
expression at the textual level in the context of text generation. The approach involves
collecting a suitable corpus of text, analyzing that text, implementing the results of the
analysis in a text generator, and verifying the output of the generator. This approach
is applicable not just to the problem of expressing procedural relations in instructional
text, but rather to any lexical or grammatical aspect of any linguistic genre.

<abstract confidence="0.987664714285714">Natural language provides an extensive set of lexical and grammatical forms for expressing concepts, a set from which writers choose the particular form that they feel will produce the most effective expression given the communicative context. An important task of the text generation researcher is to specify both the range of these forms and the contexts in which they are used. This paper addresses this issue in the context of the expression of procedural relations between actions in instructional text. It employs the following four-step approach to achieve this goal: (1) collect a corpus of the relevant text type; (2) perform a detailed linguistic study of a portion of this corpus, called the training set, and reserve the remainder as a testing set; (3) implement the results of this study in a text generation system; and (4) compare the output of the system with the text in the entire corpus. This has resulted in the construction of instructional text generation system that embodies a model of the forms of expression consistently used by text writers over a broad range of instruction types. The details of treatment of purpose expressions are given as representative of the coverage and form of the full system.</abstract>

These sources include instructions for electronic devices like cordless telephones and clock radios, manipulative processes like auto repair and first aid, and creative processes like cooking and craft making. The one common feature is that they all involve the expression of actions and of the procedural relations between them.&apos; As an example of the nature of this text, consider the following excerpt from the instructions for the GTE Airfone (Airfone 1991), which will be called the Remove-Phone text: (2) When instructed (approx. 10 sec.) remove phone by firmly grasping top of handset and pulling out.

This section discusses the systems that have been included in IMAGENE to distinguish among these contexts. There are other studies of purpose expressions from the point of view of representation and understanding that are of use here (Di Eugenio 1992; Balkanski 1992). Di Eugenio, for example, has worked with by purposes and to infinitive (TNF) purposes in the context of understanding, but does not appear to have distinguished the Iwo forms in her analysis of the procedural relations between actions. The current study is critically interested in discerning principled reasons for choosing between these sorts of expressions. The issues of slot and form of purpose expressions are treated largely independently by IMAGENE. The slot is determined by the sub-network shown in Figure 5. The form is determined by the sub-networks shown later in Figures 7 and 8. This</context>

The system network is basically a decision network in which each choice point distinguishes between alternative features of the communicative context. It has been used extensively in Systemic Linguistics to address both sentence-level and text-level issues (e.g., Berry 1981; Patten 1988; Fawcett 1990). Such networks are traversed based on the appropriate features of the communicative context, and as a side effect of this traversal, linguistic structures are constructed by realization statements that are associated with each feature of the network. Penman&apos;s networks are specifically designed to construct English sentences.

The goal of the verb, in this case the busy numbers, metonymically refers to the action as a whole. The remainder of the form selection sub-network, shown in Figure 8, is capable of generating three discrete points along the continuum from fully nominal to fully verbal forms (Quirk et al. 1985), namely the nominalization, the gerund, and to infinitive.

RST allows the representation of this situation because its relations are not defined in terms of lexical and grammatical forms (Mann and Thompson 1987).

In example (5), the purpose of ending a call is stated in contrast to placing a call in the previous sentence. It is thus fronted to set the appropriate context for the prescribed action. This fronting of contrastive purposes occurred in our corpus in the context of three oppositional semantic situations: (1) initiating/ending; (2) allowing/preventing; and (3) activating/deactivating. The results of this study predict a number of cases in which purposes should not be fronted, which is in contrast to the general claim made by Dixon (1987). He claimed that purposes should always be fronted because this facilitates the top—down construction of a procedural plan by readers as they progress through the text.

The Sequence and Concurrent relations are such relations. RST was attractive for the IMAGENE project because of its ability to represent the hierarchical structure of text with rhetorical structures that matched the level of analysis required for the study of expressions of procedural relations. There is considerable debate in the field of discourse analysis concerning the relative importance of intentional structure and rhetorical relations (e.g., Grosz and Sidner 1986; Moore and Pollack 1992), most systems focusing on one or the other. The current study has conflated them, as the instructional texts have not tended to display the complex intentional structure common to persuasive texts and interactive discourses (Vander Linden 1993b). Finally, RST has been used by many researchers for the purpose of text generation (e.g., Moore and Paris 1988; Hovy and McCoy 1989; Scott and Souza 1990; Rosner 33 Figure 1 The RST representation of the Remove-Phone text. and Stede 1992a).

The features themselves pertain to any of three aspects of the communicative context (termed metafunctions in systemic linguistics): Ideational—the propositional meaning of the material being expressed (associated with the traditional notion of semantics); Textual—the flow and structure of the text (associated with discourse analysis); and Interpersonal—the human relationships between interlocutors (associated with socio-linguistics) (Halliday 1985). All of these types of features have proven relevant in the analysis. In the test phase, the analyst attempts to validate the hypothesis by querying the database for the relevant information.

There is considerable debate in the field of discourse analysis concerning the relative importance of intentional structure and rhetorical relations (e.g., Grosz and Sidner 1986; Moore and Pollack 1992), most systems focusing on one or the other. The current study has conflated them, as the instructional texts have not tended to display the complex intentional structure common to persuasive texts and interactive discourses (Vander Linden 1993b). Finally, RST has been used by many researchers for the purpose of text generation (e.g., Moore and Paris 1988; Hovy and McCoy 1989; Scott and Souza 1990; Rosner 33 Figure 1 The RST representation of the Remove-Phone text. and Stede 1992a). This testifies not only to RST&apos;s usefulness, but also to the direct applicability of the results of the current study to the field of natural language generation. Because of the common use of RST, the results can be more easily applied to other work in this area. In particular, the focus on the precise forms of expression of rhetorical relations in instructional text fills an important gap in current work (see the work of Scott and Souza [1990] on expressing rhetorical relations).

The Systemic view is distinctly functional, that is, it is particularly interested in mapping elements of the communicative context onto the appropriate grammatical forms.

It also includes semantic information such as the agent of a particular action (e.g., the reader or the device) and the semantic type of the predication (e.g., material or relational process). More detail on the database can be found elsewhere (Vander Linden 1993c). The goal was to allow for the representation of any element of the pragmatic, semantic, or syntactic context that might be relevant in the analysis. Mann and Thompson&apos;s RST has been used to encode the rhetorical relations between expressions in the corpus (Mann and Thompson 1987, 1988). It was developed as a framework for describing text structure, viewed in terms of the semantic and pragmatic relations that hold between text spans at all levels. The current study has made use of five such relations: Purpose, Precondition, Result, Sequence, and Concurrent. This section will now make some general observations concerning RST, present an example RST analysis of the Remove-Phone text, and conclude with definitions of the relations used in the study. RST distinguishes between what are called nucleus—satellite and multi-nuclear schemata. The nucleus—satellite schema relate</context>

The second aspect of this structure is the nature of the rhetorical relations themselves. The representation makes use of five relations: Purpose, Precondition, Result, Sequence, and Concurrent, which are used as abstractions to identify the lexical and grammatical manifestations of the procedural relations inherent in the process. They are termed informational by Moore and Pollack (1992) and subject matter by Mann and Thompson (1987) because they are based on semantic content rather than on intentional or presentational content.&apos; This section will now provide specific definitions of these relations. PURPOSE (taken from Mann and Thompson 1987) constraints on N: presents an activity constraints on S: presents a situation that is unrealized constraints on the N+S combination: S presents a situation to be realized through the activity in N the effect: R recognizes that the activity in N is initiated in order to realize S The Purpose relation is taken directly from the RST specification.

The adjoined purpose form is an example of a case in which the rhetorical structure of a text need not be explicitly signaled with a lexical or grammatical cue (except textual order), called an &amp;quot;inferred connective&amp;quot; by Crothers (1979). RST allows the representation of this situation because its relations are not defined in terms of lexical and grammatical forms (Mann and Thompson 1987). When a purpose does not have conditions upon it and the scope is global, PurposeTNF marks the purpose as a to infinitive (TNF). Example (3a) illustrated this. These sorts of context-setting purposes are not demoted to phrase status. This reflects the fact that global purposes are not expressed in phrasal form in our corpus. The Volitionality system determines whether the purpose expresses the desire of the reader to get some inanimate substance to perform in some volitional way. This context usually leads to the use of the so that purpose, as shown in example (3g). Quite often these substanc</context>

The descriptive observation has been made that when nominalized forms of a verb exist in the lexicon, they tend to be used.

There are other natural language generation projects that have addressed similar issues. Two such examples are Hovy&apos;s Pauline (Hovy 1988a) and Meteer&apos;s Spokesman (Meteer 1991, 1992), both of which are based, at least in part, on corpus studies. Pauline produces an impressive range of expressional forms that are based on a list of pragmatic features of the communicative environment, including information about the conversational atmosphere, the speaker, the hearer, the relationship between the two, and the interpersonal communicative goals of the speaker.

The concerns of the IMAGENE project are similar, except that both the text type (instructional text) and the linguistic phenomenon (expressing rhetorical relations) are much more focused. The results of our study are therefore more detailed, but also more constrained (see the concept of domain communication knowledge, as described by Kittredge, Korelsky, and Rambow [1991]). In the Spokesman project, Meteer proposed an architecture for addressing what she termed the problem of expressibility in text planning (Meteer 1992). Her fundamental thesis is that an abstract linguistic representation is needed to provide the text planner with information on constraints of expression (see Vaughan, and McDonald 1987). Her constraints are taken, at least in part, from a study of text revisions made by expert editors. The IMAGENE project concurs with this concern for detailed forms of expression, but its methodology is geared toward determining the elements of the communicative context used to choose between equally acceptable alternative forms of expression.

There is considerable debate in the field of discourse analysis concerning the relative importance of intentional structure and rhetorical relations (e.g., Grosz and Sidner 1986; Moore and Pollack 1992), most systems focusing on one or the other. The current study has conflated them, as the instructional texts have not tended to display the complex intentional structure common to persuasive texts and interactive discourses (Vander Linden 1993b). Finally, RST has been used by many researchers for the purpose of text generation (e.g., Moore and Paris 1988; Hovy and McCoy 1989; Scott and Souza 1990; Rosner 33 Figure 1 The RST representation of the Remove-Phone text. and Stede 1992a). This testifies not only to RST&apos;s usefulness, but also to the direct applicability of the results of the current study to the field of natural language generation. Because of the common use of RST, the results can be more easily applied to other work in this area. In particular, the focus on the precise forms of expression of rhetorical relations in instructional text fills an important gap in current work (see the work of Scott and Souza [1990] on expressing rhetorical relations).

A more detailed analysis of how the situations that give rise to them differ from those for other purposes is yet to be performed. 38 Keith Vander Linden and James H.

Of the 119 purpose expressions, approximately 48% are fronted and 52% are not fronted. These values are similar to the percentages of initial and final purpose clauses found by Thompson (1985) for procedural texts. Although she reports just over 18% initial purpose clauses for English text in general, she reports 49% initial purpose clauses for a book of recipes and 34% for an auto-repair manual. Thompson&apos;s study indicated that one common feature of fronted purpose clauses is that their scope is global, that is, there is more than one expressed proposition that is directly related to the fulfillment of the purpose (e.g., &amp;quot;To achieve purpose A, do B and do C.&amp;quot; where there are two sub-actions, B and C).

The slot determination portion of the purpose sub-network, shown in Figure 5, formalizes Thompson&apos;s notion of the &amp;quot;vastly different functions&amp;quot; for initial and final purpose clauses (Thompson 1985) in the context of instructional text. It typically places the purpose expression in the final position. The exceptions to this are when the scope of the purpose is global, the purpose is considered optional, or the purpose is considered contrastive. These three exceptions are handled by the three systems depicted in Figure 5.9 The first exception, handled by the Scope system, concerns the number of actions pertained to by the purpose.

Related Work in Natural Language Generation In pursuit of other issues, many studies have adopted a temporary solution to the problem of managing diverse forms of expression, namely, that of choosing a single lexical and grammatical form to express each of the relevant types of information dealt with by the system. It is then a simple matter of allowing the type of information to determine the appropriate expressional form. Hovy&apos;s text structurer (Hovy 1988b), for example, uses rhetorical relations as defined in Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann and Thompson 1987) to order a set of propositions to be expressed. It does not make any decision as to how a chosen relation is to be expressed, but rather leaves this task to the rudimentary implementation of the rhetorical relations provided by the Penman text generation system (Mann 1985). In the case of a purpose, for example, Penman will produce a non-fronted in order to infinitive clause, as in the following output of the structurer (Hovy 1988b, p. 167): &amp;quot;Knox is en route in order to rendezvous with CTG 070.10.&amp;quot; A similar approach to expressing rhetorical relations was taken in McKeown&apos;s TEXT system (McKe</context>
<context position="15649" citStr="Thompson 1987" startWordPosition="2467" endWordPosition="2468">ed to represent relative clauses and predicate—argument relations. It also includes semantic information such as the agent of a particular action (e.g., the reader or the device) and the semantic type of the predication (e.g., material or relational process). More detail on the database can be found elsewhere (Vander Linden 1993c). The goal was to allow for the representation of any element of the pragmatic, semantic, or syntactic context that might be relevant in the analysis. Mann and Thompson&apos;s RST has been used to encode the rhetorical relations between expressions in the corpus (Mann and Thompson 1987, 1988). It was developed as a framework for describing text structure, viewed in terms of the semantic and pragmatic relations that hold between text spans at all levels. The current study has made use of five such relations: Purpose, Precondition, Result, Sequence, and Concurrent. This section will now make some general observations concerning RST, present an example RST analysis of the Remove-Phone text, and conclude with definitions of the relations used in the study. RST distinguishes between what are called nucleus—satellite and multi-nuclear schemata. The nucleus—satellite schema relate</context>

The second aspect of this structure is the nature of the rhetorical relations themselves. The representation makes use of five relations: Purpose, Precondition, Result, Sequence, and Concurrent, which are used as abstractions to identify the lexical and grammatical manifestations of the procedural relations inherent in the process. They are termed informational by Moore and Pollack (1992) and subject matter by Mann and Thompson (1987) because they are based on semantic content rather than on intentional or presentational content.&apos; This section will now provide specific definitions of these relations. PURPOSE (taken from Mann and Thompson 1987) constraints on N: presents an activity constraints on S: presents a situation that is unrealized constraints on the N+S combination: S presents a situation to be realized through the activity in N the effect: R recognizes that the activity in N is initiated in order to realize S The Purpose relation is taken directly from the RST specification.

Because of the prevalence of this use of the term, however, it will be retained in this paper. 35 Computational Linguistics Volume 21, Number 1 frequently arise in instructions, such as the precondition found in the Remove-Phone text: &amp;quot;When instructed (approx. 10 sec.) remove phone . ..&amp;quot; Here, the removal of the phone must not be attempted until after the device has instructed the user to do so.

The adjoined purpose form is an example of a case in which the rhetorical structure of a text need not be explicitly signaled with a lexical or grammatical cue (except textual order), called an &amp;quot;inferred connective&amp;quot; by Crothers (1979). RST allows the representation of this situation because its relations are not defined in terms of lexical and grammatical forms (Mann and Thompson 1987). When a purpose does not have conditions upon it and the scope is global, PurposeTNF marks the purpose as a to infinitive (TNF). Example (3a) illustrated this. These sorts of context-setting purposes are not demoted to phrase status. This reflects the fact that global purposes are not expressed in phrasal form in our corpus. The Volitionality system determines whether the purpose expresses the desire of the reader to get some inanimate substance to perform in some volitional way. This context usually leads to the use of the so that purpose, as shown in example (3g). Quite often these substanc</context>

Nominal-Availability will realize a prepositional phrase with a nominalization as the complement whenever the appropriate nominalization exists, as in example (9a).&apos; 13 This analysis of nominalizations is an example of the descriptive nature of the current study of instructional text. The descriptive observation has been made that when nominalized forms of a verb exist in the lexicon, they tend to be used. A full explanatory account, in the spirit of current Discourse-Functional studies (e.g., Matthiessen and Thompson 1987; Thompson 1987), would attempt to identify the precise aspect of the action or the context of its expression that would dictate the use of a nominalization, thus resulting in the development of a nominalized form in the English language. Such an account is beyond the scope of the current study. 47 Computational Linguistics Volume 21, Number 1 (9a) Follow the steps in the illustration below, for desk installation.
