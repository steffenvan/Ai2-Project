This volume contains the papers prepared for the 33rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational
Linguistics, held from 26-30 June at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
In a separate section, it also contains the papers that were selected by the student program committee for
presentation at the student poster session.
A large number of people in many places have contributed to the success of this year&apos;s meeting. First of all
I would like to thank our keynote speakers Bonnie Webber and Victor Zue for accepting our invitation to
present their exciting research at the meeting. As tutorial chair Yves Shabes organized an attractive and
balanced pre-conference program. Special thanks go to the instructors he enlisted: Beth Levin (Northwestern
University), Emmanuel Roche (Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories), Kenneth Ward Church (AT&amp;T
Bell Laboratories), and Lynette Hirschman and Marc Vilain (The Mitre Corporation). Robert Berwick
served as the local arrangements chair. Together with his students and staff he put much thought and a
tremendous amount of work into the organization of registration, rooms, exhibits, demonstrations, banquet,
as well as the general logistics of the conference.
Kathy McKeown, the new Secretary/Treasurer of the ACL, assumed a very active role in the preparation of
the conference. In an observant and insistent way she checked on deadlines and formats and made sure that
the communication among the different organizers never stalled.
I particularly want to express my gratitude to Joanne Capstick for assisting me in a calm and efficient way
during all phases of the preparation of the program and of these proceedings. She did the actual work.
Thorsten Brants and other members of our local staff helped with printing and formatting.
The traditional reviewing process of the ACL puts a heavy burden on the members of the program committee.
This year each member had to read and evaluate up to 20 papers. They performed this work in a very careful
and efficient manner. We followed the tradition of &apos;blind&apos; reviewing which, although not watertight, had
proved very effective in previous years. The final selection was made in an intensive one-day meeting in
New York City. I want the members of the program committee to know that their enormous work is greatly
appreciated by all of us. It was a great pleasure to work with these delightful colleagues:

The program committee is very grateful to Ralph Grishman and his group at NYU for hosting the program
committee meeting and for providing excellent facilities and assistance.
The program committee for the student session, co-chaired by Vasileios Hatzivassiloglou and Johanna Moore,
invested much time and energy to make this important part of the conference a success. Before the first call
for papers for ACL 95 was issued, the executive committee had engaged in a lengthy and very constructive
discussion of the appropriate format for a session at which student members of ACL could present work in
progress. This discussion also involved program and student program chairs from this as well as previous
conferences. It was decided that a poster session would be the best forum for presenting high-quality research
not yet at the state to qualify for the main sessions. We feel that the excellent selection of papers made
by the student program committee justifies this decision and we hope that the students will continue to
participate actively in our annual meetings.

TUTORIALS
Lexical Semantics
Beth Levin, Northwestern University

<bodyText confidence="0.918654">
There has been a growing interest in lexical semantics over the last ten years. This interest can be traced to the
increased importance of the lexicon in many linguistic frameworks; this in turn has led to the serious investigation
of the relationship between syntax and word meaning. During the same period the acquisition and representation
of lexical information have become central foci of work in computational linguistics. This tutorial will introduce
computational linguists to lexical semantics and review recent developments in this area. I will begin by setting out
the notion of semantically-coherent verb class, which has proved valuable to the lexical classification of verbs, and
by discussing its implications for the representation of lexical knowledge and the lexical semantics-syntax mapping.
Organizing principles of the verb lexicon will be covered, as will certain complications presented by polysemy. Finally,
I will sketch some similarities and divergences in lexical organization between languages.
Finite-State Tools for Language Processing

Finite-state tools have been part of Natural Language Processing (NLP) since the beginning. However, whereas
many techniques are now considered standard, very few of the most recent mathematical results are known to
non-mathematicians or have been incorporated into concrete applications. Moreover, mathematical presentations are
often concerned with proofs and not necessarily constructive algorithms; and so it is only recently that many practical
algorithmic issues have started to be addressed. As will be seen in this tutorial, contributions of finite-state processing
to NLP range from strong efficiency improvements of old techniques to radically new solutions. The tutorial will be
self-contained and should be accessible to those with basic computer science and linguistic knowledge. It will first
briefly give a list of pointers to the classical results and it will then present recent results, such as decomposition
of finite-state transducers and subminimal compression. Each technique will be systematically illustrated through
applications to morphology, phonology, and local and global syntax.

Text is more available than ever before: dictionaries, corpora, email, faxes. Many laboratories have tens of millions
of words, and some even have billions. What can we do with it all? It is better to do something than nothing at all.
We will show some very simple Unix(TM) programs for counting words and ngrams, and generating concordances.
Word and ngram counts have been used in a wide variety of applications: part of speech tagging, speech recognition,
spelling correction, text compression, word-sense disambiguation, information retrieval, and author identification. In
the past, we have tended to focus our attention on bigrams and trigrams. Suffix arrays make it practical to search
for 5-grams, 50-grams and even 5000-grams. Long ngrams are far more common than you might have thought. In
Genesis, for example, there are hundreds of repeated sequences of 50 characters or more such as: &amp;quot;Be fruitful, and
multiply, and replenish the earth.&amp;quot; We have to be careful when using long ngrams in prediction tasks; poor estimates
of context can be worse than none. How do we estimate the probability of ngrams we haven&apos;t seen? How do we
combine ngrams of different lengths? Probabilities depend on a variety of hidden variables: topic, author, genre, etc.
How do we compensate for the fact that text is more than just a bag of words?
Extracting Information from the MUC
Lynette Hirschman and Marc Vilain, The Mitre Corporation
This tutorial will review the rapid progress in information extraction systems (also called message understanding
systems) over the past decade. These systems have grown from fragile toy systems to robust systems achieving recall
and precision of around 60% on complex extraction tasks. This progress has been closely linked to the introduction of
formal evaluation methods used in the Message Understanding Conferences (MUCs). In the first half of the tutorial,
we will trace the evolution from the early MUC conferences to the present, tracking the interplay of evaluation and
technological progress, focusing on advances such as robust parsing, special purpose processors (e.g., phrase and
name identification), and faster, simpler systems. In the second half of this tutorial, we will focus on portability,
highlighting the importance of shared resources (annotated corpora, lexicons, etc.) and corpus-based techniques,
including machine learning and statistical approaches. We will consider ways to bootstrap into new domains, to
combine rules derived from experts with corpus-based rules, and to reduce the demands of development of training
corpora. We will illustrate this in part with recent results at MITRE in transformation-based learning.

PREFACE TO THE STUDENT SESSION PAPERS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.977200870967742">
These proceedings include the extended abstracts for the poster presentations at the Student Session of the
33rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics. The goal of the Student Session is to
provide a forum for student members to present work in progress, rather than completed work, and to receive
feedback from other members of the computational linguistics community, particularly senior researchers.
The response to the ACL Student Sessions held during the previous years was very positive. The student
authors consistently report that they find the Student Sessions valuable, and answers to questionnaires filled
out by ACL members (most recently in 1994) indicate that the audiences find the sessions interesting and
of high quality.
This year, a new format has been adopted on a trial basis. Instead of brief ten-minute presentations in
parallel sessions, student authors will have the opportunity to present their work in a special poster session,
with a higher potential for one-on-one discussions of the details and future directions of their research.
Comments on the success of this experiment are actively sought from both the student authors and the ACL
membership at large, to determine the optimal format that the sessions should have in the future.
Forty-eight papers were submitted to the ACL Student Session in 1995, thus equalling the previous highest
number of submissions, from 1992. Out of these, we were able to accept nineteen papers, an all-time high.
The increased number of accepted papers is partly due to the higher flexibility offered by the poster format.
Nevertheless, we still had to leave out a number of interesting papers. We thank all the authors for their
submissions, and hope that the reviews encourage them in their research, provide constructive criticism, and
introduce them to the process of disseminating their work more broadly.
We are grateful to the reviewers for providing helpful, detailed reviews of the submissions under a very
tight time schedule. We thank the student members of the ACL 1995 Student Session Program Committee,
who helped plan the Student Session and served as reviewers: Jennifer Chu-Carroll, University of Delaware;
Christy Doran, University of Pennsylvania; Philip Edmonds, University of Toronto; Mark Lauer, Macquarie
University and Microsoft Institute; Lillian Lee, Harvard University; Carl de Marcken, Massachusetts Insti-
tute of Technology; Gerrit Rentier, Tilburg University; Hinrich Schiitze, Stanford University; Wojciech Skut,
Universitiit des Saarlandes; Mettina Veenstra, University of Groningen; Karen Ward, Oregon Graduate In-
stitute; and R. Michael Young, University of Pittsburgh. Carl de Marcken, in addition to his duties as a
Program Committee member, served as liaison to the Local Arrangements Committee; we thank Robert
Berwick (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) for his help with these issues. We also thank the non-
student members of the Student Session Program Committee, who provided reviews and their invaluable
experience as senior researchers: Susan Armstrong, /SSCO; Nicholas Asher, University of Texas at Austin;

Together with his students and staff he put much thought and a tremendous amount of work into the organization of registration, rooms, exhibits, demonstrations, banquet, as well as the general logistics of the conference. Kathy McKeown, the new Secretary/Treasurer of the ACL, assumed a very active role in the preparation of the conference. In an observant and insistent way she checked on deadlines and formats and made sure that the communication among the different organizers never stalled. I particularly want to express my gratitude to Joanne Capstick for assisting me in a calm and efficient way during all phases of the preparation of the program and of these proceedings. She did the actual work. Thorsten Brants and other members of our local staff helped with printing and formatting. The traditional reviewing process of the ACL puts a heavy burden on the members of the program committee. This year each member had to read and evaluate up to 20 papers. They performed this work in a very careful and efficient manner. We followed the tradition of &apos;blind&apos; reviewing which, although not watertight, had proved very effective in previous years. The final selection was made in an intensive one-day meeting in</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.984757545454545">The program committee is very grateful to Ralph Grishman and his group at NYU for hosting the program committee meeting and for providing excellent facilities and assistance. The program committee for the student session, co-chaired by Vasileios Hatzivassiloglou and Johanna Moore, invested much time and energy to make this important part of the conference a success. Before the first call for papers for ACL 95 was issued, the executive committee had engaged in a lengthy and very constructive discussion of the appropriate format for a session at which student members of ACL could present work in progress. This discussion also involved program and student program chairs from this as well as previous conferences. It was decided that a poster session would be the best forum for presenting high-quality research not yet at the state to qualify for the main sessions. We feel that the excellent selection of papers made by the student program committee justifies this decision and we hope that the students will continue to participate actively in our annual meetings.</abstract>

<author confidence="0.494201">Northwestern Levin</author>
<abstract confidence="0.901796846153846">There has been a growing interest in lexical semantics over the last ten years. This interest can be traced to the increased importance of the lexicon in many linguistic frameworks; this in turn has led to the serious investigation of the relationship between syntax and word meaning. During the same period the acquisition and representation of lexical information have become central foci of work in computational linguistics. This tutorial will introduce computational linguists to lexical semantics and review recent developments in this area. I will begin by setting out the notion of semantically-coherent verb class, which has proved valuable to the lexical classification of verbs, and by discussing its implications for the representation of lexical knowledge and the lexical semantics-syntax mapping. Organizing principles of the verb lexicon will be covered, as will certain complications presented by polysemy. Finally, I will sketch some similarities and divergences in lexical organization between languages. Tools for Language Processing Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories Finite-state tools have been part of Natural Language Processing (NLP) since the beginning. However, whereas many techniques are now considered standard, very few of the most recent mathematical results are known to non-mathematicians or have been incorporated into concrete applications. Moreover, mathematical presentations are often concerned with proofs and not necessarily constructive algorithms; and so it is only recently that many practical algorithmic issues have started to be addressed. As will be seen in this tutorial, contributions of finite-state processing to NLP range from strong efficiency improvements of old techniques to radically new solutions. The tutorial will be self-contained and should be accessible to those with basic computer science and linguistic knowledge. It will first briefly give a list of pointers to the classical results and it will then present recent results, such as decomposition of finite-state transducers and subminimal compression. Each technique will be systematically illustrated through applications to morphology, phonology, and local and global syntax. Ngrams AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories Text is more available than ever before: dictionaries, corpora, email, faxes. Many laboratories have tens of millions of words, and some even have billions. What can we do with it all? It is better to do something than nothing at all. We will show some very simple Unix(TM) programs for counting words and ngrams, and generating concordances. Word and ngram counts have been used in a wide variety of applications: part of speech tagging, speech recognition, spelling correction, text compression, word-sense disambiguation, information retrieval, and author identification. In the past, we have tended to focus our attention on bigrams and trigrams. Suffix arrays make it practical to search for 5-grams, 50-grams and even 5000-grams. Long ngrams are far more common than you might have thought. In Genesis, for example, there are hundreds of repeated sequences of 50 characters or more such as: &amp;quot;Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.&amp;quot; We have to be careful when using long ngrams in prediction tasks; poor estimates of context can be worse than none. How do we estimate the probability of ngrams we haven&apos;t seen? How do we combine ngrams of different lengths? Probabilities depend on a variety of hidden variables: topic, author, genre, etc. How do we compensate for the fact that text is more than just a bag of words? Extracting Information from the MUC Hirschman Marc Vilain, Mitre This tutorial will review the rapid progress in information extraction systems (also called message understanding systems) over the past decade. These systems have grown from fragile toy systems to robust systems achieving recall</abstract>
