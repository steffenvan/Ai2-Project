HLT-NAACL 2004: Main Volume, May 2–7, 2004
Preface
</note>
<bodyText confidence="0.998790032258065">
This year’s HLT/NAACL 2004 continues to combine the research efforts of
the Human Language Technologies (HLT) and the North Amercian chapter
of the Association for Computational Linguistict (NAACL) in a single confer-
ence. This year we specifically focus on bringing together researchers in speech
recognition, information retrieval, and natural language processing, to share
results in topics of mutual interest, including cross-language retrieval; summa-
rization; question-answering; language modeling for speech or IR; all aspects of
speech recognition and synthesis; entity extraction; parsing and grammatical
formalisms; machine translation; shallow and formal semantics; language gen-
eration; dialogue systems; evaluation of language systems; and applications of
machine learning to all three areas represented in the conference. We have tried
to prepare a conference that will showcase complementary research efforts in
the three fields of endeavor, to promote cooperation and collaboration among
those with similar long-term research interests.
As the general chair of this conference, I thank the people who have worked
hard to make the conference possible, especially the local arrangements chair,
Christy Doran; the Program Committee Chairs, Sue Dumais, Daniel Marcu,
and Salim Roukos; and the chairs of the conference subcommittees, Joe Po-
lifroni, David Palmer, and Deb Roy (Demos); Miles Osborne, Katrin Kirchoff,
and Gina Levow (Publications); Shri Narayanan, Peter Anick, and Peter Hee-
man (Publicity); Doug Jones and Roberto Pierracini (Sponsorships); Amanda
Stent, Lisa Ballesteros, and Eric Fosler-Lussier (Student Workshop Advisors);
Ani Nenkova, Karen Livescu, and Nicola Stokes (Student Workshop) Andy
Kehler, Alex Acero, and Manie Callan (Tutorials); Richard Sproat, Bhuvana
Ramabhadran, and Alan Smeaton (Workshops). Many thanks also to Pablo
Duboue, Kathy McCoy, Dragomir Radev, and Priscilla Rasmussen, for their
help. Thanks also to the members of the HLT/NAACL advisory committee,
the NAACL executive committee, and the ACL executive board, for their help
and advice. I also want to thank our sponsors, the many members of our pro-
gram committees and reviewers, the student volunteers, and the many others
who have contributed their time and effort to making this conference possible.

On this second anniversary of the joint HLT/NAACL conference, the field of Human Language
Technology (HLT) seems vibrant and moving by leaps and bounds. Evidence of this can be found in the
existence of a variety of language resources, combined with advances in statistical analysis and modeling
techniques, and the relatively large number of community-wide evaluations of NLP systems. Lexical
resources such as FrameNet, WordNet, PropBank, the ACE Corpus, the Penn TreeBank, and parallel
corpora, and test collections for information retrieval, question answering and text classification play
prominent roles in HLT advances. Great strides are being made in the sophistication and coverage of
information retrieval, question answering and machine translation systems. The current accuracy of speech
recognition systems has enabled the development of conversational systems, information extraction and
retrieval from recognized speech, and topic tracking on spoken documents. Large and growing collections
of annotated text and speech corpora – and the promise of much more unannotated data from the web –
will continue to fuel these rapid advances.
The number and quality of submissions we received is another testament to the increased interest and
progress in the field. We received 168 submissions for full papers, of which 43 were accepted, resulting in
a highly competitive acceptance rate of 26%. (Thirty-nine submissions received an average score of 4.0 or
higher, on a reviewing scale of 1 to 5.) In addition, we received 84 submissions for the short (late-
breaking) papers track, of which 40 were accepted. Half of the short papers are presented as short talks and
others as posters. In addition to the technical papers, the HLT/NAACL 2004 conference showcases 19
demonstrations, 6 tutorials, and 12 workshops, which includes a student research workshop. We thank
everyone who submitted proposals, whether or not they were accepted. Your participation is critical to the
moving forward of the field, and we hope the reviewer feedback was helpful.
The full paper reviewing was done using a two-tiered system. Twenty Area Chairs were responsible for a
topical area and coordinated the review process within those areas. Each Area Chair recruited a set of
Reviewers and ensured that submitted papers were reviewed by at least 3 reviewers. We had a total of 149
reviewers. The Area Chairs acted at meta-reviewers and moderated discussions of papers where the initial
ratings varied. Papers where there were disagreements or questions were subsequently reviewed by another
member of the program committee. Area Chairs also attended a one day Program Committee meeting in
which papers were discussed and acceptances were decided. The same process was used for the late-
breaking (short) papers, except that the one day meeting was replaced by a conference call. Paper
submission and reviewing was done online with commercial conference software that Daniel Marcu and
Radu Soricut managed at ISI.
Many people have contributed to the exciting program at the HLT/NAACL 2004 conference. We thank our
large and able reviewer pools; their careful and timely reviews made it possible to include both high quality
and late breaking results. We owe a great debt to the members of the program committee, who we believe
are responsible for the high quality of the submissions (their presence on the program committee no doubt
encouraging top-notch research to be submitted). Their excellent judgment helped lead to the compilation
of a stimulating and forward-looking set of papers. The program committee was also responsible for
suggesting and approving a &amp;quot;Best Paper&amp;quot; award. This was somewhat controversial among the various
committees with concerns about keeping high enough standards for such a designation in the future. This
year, the award goes to &amp;quot;Catching the Drift: Probabilistic Content Models, with Applications to Generation
and Summarization&amp;quot; by Regina Barzilay, MIT, and Lillian Lee, Cornell. We believe this paper merits the
attention of the community.
The two Keynote Talks we have selected for presentation at HLT/NAACL 2004 denote the maturity of our
field, which has an increasing impact on large-scale, commercial applications. The first keynote address by
Dr. Andrei Broder, entitled &amp;quot;Ten years of Web Search Technology&amp;quot;, gives an overview of a big playground
for language technologies. Dr. Broder discusses the evolution of web search over the past decade, how
users&apos; expectations are evolving based on their use of web search technology, and implications of this work
in the enterprise search arena. The second keynote address by Dr. Jill Burstein, entitled &amp;quot;Automated Essay
Evaluation: From NLP research through deployment as a business&amp;quot;, describes the development of
technology for automatic essay evaluation and its deployment as a business.
We are pleased to have outstanding lecturers covering a broad range of HLT topics, including both
statistical and non-statistical work in natural language processing, topics in speech and information
retrieval, and general methods for optimization and estimation. In addition to the technical papers, the
program also includes a varied and interested set of demonstrations, workshops and tutorials. We thank
David Palmer, Joe Polifroni and Deb Roy for managing the recruiting and reviewing of demonstrations;
Alex Acero, Jamie Callan and Andy Kehler for putting together a rich program of Tutorials; Bhuvana
Ramabhadran, Alan Smeaton and Richard Sproat for coordinating the Workshop activities; and, Ani
Nenkova, Nicola Stokes and Karen Licescu for handling the Student Workshops. We also thank Miles
Osborne, Katrin Kirchoff and Gina-Ann Levow for their work in pulling all this information together (in
very short time) for the conference proceedings.
Most of our decisions had to be approved by a large and diverse committee representing NAACL, HLT,
ISCA, and SIGIR, as well as different government sponsors of HLT research. We are pleased to report that
despite this seemingly cumbersome situation, our questions were always resolved within one or two days, if
not hours, and with great alacrity. We thank all of the board members for their ongoing support of research
and development in human language technologies!
We did our best to merge the different goals of the communities, and we think we succeeded for the most
part. We also worked hard to solicit involvement from all of the associated communities, and we are
especially pleased about the interdisciplinary nature of many of the papers. As the conference becomes
better known, we hope to see this trend continue. We feel that, although there is room for improvement, the
HLT/NAACL merge was a success in attracting high quality work and in bridging gaps, and hope to see it
continue next year.

<abstract confidence="0.9207611">acl@aclweb.org www.aclweb.org HLT-NAACL 2004: Main Volume, May 2–7, 2004 Preface This year’s HLT/NAACL 2004 continues to combine the research efforts of the Human Language Technologies (HLT) and the North Amercian chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistict (NAACL) in a single conference. This year we specifically focus on bringing together researchers in speech recognition, information retrieval, and natural language processing, to share results in topics of mutual interest, including cross-language retrieval; summarization; question-answering; language modeling for speech or IR; all aspects of speech recognition and synthesis; entity extraction; parsing and grammatical formalisms; machine translation; shallow and formal semantics; language generation; dialogue systems; evaluation of language systems; and applications of machine learning to all three areas represented in the conference. We have tried to prepare a conference that will showcase complementary research efforts in the three fields of endeavor, to promote cooperation and collaboration among those with similar long-term research interests. As the general chair of this conference, I thank the people who have worked hard to make the conference possible, especially the local arrangements chair,</abstract>

<title confidence="0.942486333333333">General Chair Preface from the Program Co-chairs On this second anniversary of the joint HLT/NAACL conference, the field of Human Language</title>
<abstract confidence="0.987436698113208">Technology (HLT) seems vibrant and moving by leaps and bounds. Evidence of this can be found in the existence of a variety of language resources, combined with advances in statistical analysis and modeling techniques, and the relatively large number of community-wide evaluations of NLP systems. Lexical resources such as FrameNet, WordNet, PropBank, the ACE Corpus, the Penn TreeBank, and parallel corpora, and test collections for information retrieval, question answering and text classification play prominent roles in HLT advances. Great strides are being made in the sophistication and coverage of information retrieval, question answering and machine translation systems. The current accuracy of speech recognition systems has enabled the development of conversational systems, information extraction and retrieval from recognized speech, and topic tracking on spoken documents. Large and growing collections and speech corpora – and the promise of much more from the web – will continue to fuel these rapid advances. The number and quality of submissions we received is another testament to the increased interest and progress in the field. We received 168 submissions for full papers, of which 43 were accepted, resulting in a highly competitive acceptance rate of 26%. (Thirty-nine submissions received an average score of 4.0 or higher, on a reviewing scale of 1 to 5.) In addition, we received 84 submissions for the short (latebreaking) papers track, of which 40 were accepted. Half of the short papers are presented as short talks and others as posters. In addition to the technical papers, the HLT/NAACL 2004 conference showcases 19 demonstrations, 6 tutorials, and 12 workshops, which includes a student research workshop. We thank everyone who submitted proposals, whether or not they were accepted. Your participation is critical to the moving forward of the field, and we hope the reviewer feedback was helpful. The full paper reviewing was done using a two-tiered system. Twenty Area Chairs were responsible for a topical area and coordinated the review process within those areas. Each Area Chair recruited a set of Reviewers and ensured that submitted papers were reviewed by at least 3 reviewers. We had a total of 149 reviewers. The Area Chairs acted at meta-reviewers and moderated discussions of papers where the initial ratings varied. Papers where there were disagreements or questions were subsequently reviewed by another member of the program committee. Area Chairs also attended a one day Program Committee meeting in which papers were discussed and acceptances were decided. The same process was used for the latebreaking (short) papers, except that the one day meeting was replaced by a conference call. Paper submission and reviewing was done online with commercial conference software that Daniel Marcu and Radu Soricut managed at ISI. Many people have contributed to the exciting program at the HLT/NAACL 2004 conference. We thank our large and able reviewer pools; their careful and timely reviews made it possible to include both high quality and late breaking results. We owe a great debt to the members of the program committee, who we believe are responsible for the high quality of the submissions (their presence on the program committee no doubt encouraging top-notch research to be submitted). Their excellent judgment helped lead to the compilation of a stimulating and forward-looking set of papers. The program committee was also responsible for suggesting and approving a &amp;quot;Best Paper&amp;quot; award. This was somewhat controversial among the various committees with concerns about keeping high enough standards for such a designation in the future. This the award goes to the Drift: Probabilistic Content Models, with Applications to Generation by Regina Barzilay, MIT, and Lillian Lee, Cornell. We believe this paper merits the attention of the community. The two Keynote Talks we have selected for presentation at HLT/NAACL 2004 denote the maturity of our field, which has an increasing impact on large-scale, commercial applications. The first keynote address by Andrei Broder, entitled years of Web Search gives an overview of a big playground for language technologies. Dr. Broder discusses the evolution of web search over the past decade, how users&apos; expectations are evolving based on their use of web search technology, and implications of this work the enterprise search arena. The second keynote address by Dr. Jill Burstein, entitled Essay From NLP research through deployment as a describes the development of technology for automatic essay evaluation and its deployment as a business. We are pleased to have outstanding lecturers covering a broad range of HLT topics, including both statistical and non-statistical work in natural language processing, topics in speech and information retrieval, and general methods for optimization and estimation. In addition to the technical papers, the program also includes a varied and interested set of demonstrations, workshops and tutorials. We thank</abstract>
<degree confidence="0.7372686">David Palmer, Joe Polifroni and Deb Roy for managing the recruiting and reviewing of demonstrations; Alex Acero, Jamie Callan and Andy Kehler for putting together a rich program of Tutorials; Bhuvana Ramabhadran, Alan Smeaton and Richard Sproat for coordinating the Workshop activities; and, Ani Nenkova, Nicola Stokes and Karen Licescu for handling the Student Workshops. We also thank Miles Osborne, Katrin Kirchoff and Gina-Ann Levow for their work in pulling all this information together (in</degree>
<abstract confidence="0.997796083333333">very short time) for the conference proceedings. Most of our decisions had to be approved by a large and diverse committee representing NAACL, HLT, ISCA, and SIGIR, as well as different government sponsors of HLT research. We are pleased to report that despite this seemingly cumbersome situation, our questions were always resolved within one or two days, if not hours, and with great alacrity. We thank all of the board members for their ongoing support of research and development in human language technologies! We did our best to merge the different goals of the communities, and we think we succeeded for the most part. We also worked hard to solicit involvement from all of the associated communities, and we are especially pleased about the interdisciplinary nature of many of the papers. As the conference becomes better known, we hope to see this trend continue. We feel that, although there is room for improvement, the HLT/NAACL merge was a success in attracting high quality work and in bridging gaps, and hope to see it continue next year.</abstract>
