Lexical semantics (the semantics of words) has become an important part of Natural Language
Processing due to its practical application in a number of areas such as machine translation, web &amp;
enterprise search, ontology learning etc.
This fact can be observed by looking at the increasing interest in the field of learning of lexical semantics
e.g. the last Semantic Evaluation Workshop (SemEval-2007) consisted of 18 tasks ranging from the
traditional Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) task to the most recent of Word Sense Induction (WSI),
web people search, metonymy resolution and others.
Given the wide variety of applications exploiting lexical semantics it is significant to focus on methods
and techniques, which can overcome the ”Knowledge Acquisition Bottleneck” and deal with the cost-
prohibitive, error-prone and labor-intensive processes of creating hand-tagged training data.
The emphasis of this workshop is on unsupervised and minimally supervised methods relevant to
learning of lexical semantics. The goal of this workshop is to provide a venue for researchers to
obtain a better understanding on the issues and challenges that need to be tackled in order to overcome
a number of significant problems within lexical semantics, such as data sparsity, unsupervised and
minimally supervised parameter estimation, efficient and effective use of the web, and applications of
distributional similarity.
We are very happy that the workshop has accepted a set of seven high quality papers tackling the above
problems, and hope that their contribution will have an impact on the field. We are grateful to the
program committee for their effort to thoroughly review the submissions. We would also like to thank
Martha Palmer for presenting her noteworthy work in the workshop.

Abstract Supervised word sense disambiguation requires training corpora that have been tagged with
word senses, and these word senses typically come from a pre-existing sense inventory. Space limi-
tations imposed by dictionary publishers have biased the field towards lists of discrete senses for an
individual lexeme. This approach does not capture information about relatedness of individual senses.
How important is this information to knowing which sense distinctions are critical for particular types
of NLP applications? How much does sense relatedness affect automatic word sense disambiguation
performance? Recent psycholinguistic evidence seems to indicate that closely related word senses may
be represented in the mental lexicon much like a single sense, whereas distantly related senses may be
represented more like discrete entities. These results suggest that, for the purposes of WSD, closely re-
lated word senses can be clustered together into a more general sense with little meaning loss. This talk
will describe the relatedness of verb senses and its impact on NLP applications and WSD components
as well as recent psycholinguistic research results.
