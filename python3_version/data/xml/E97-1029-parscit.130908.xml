We present a constraint-based morpholog-
ical disambiguation system in which indi-
vidual constraints vote on matching mor-
phological parses, and disambiguation of
all the tokens in a sentence is performed
at the end by selecting parses that receive
the highest votes. This constraint applica-
tion paradigm makes the outcome of the
disambiguation independent of the rule se-
quence, and hence relieves the rule devel-
oper from worrying about potentially con-
flicting rule sequencing. Our results for
disambiguating Turkish indicate that using
about 500 constraint rules and some addi-
tional simple statistics, we can attain a re-
call of 95-96% and a precision of 94-95%
with about 1.01 parses per token. Our sys-
tem is implemented in Prolog and we are
currently investigating an efficient imple-
mentation based on finite state transduc-
ers.

Automatic morphological disambiguation is an im-
portant component in higher level analysis of natural
language text corpora. There has been a large num-
ber of studies in tagging and morphological disam-
biguation using various techniques such as statisti-
cal techniques, e.g., (Church, 1988; Cutting et al.,
1992; DeRose, 1988), constraint-based techniques
(Karlsson et al., 1995; Voutilainen, 1995b; Vouti-
lainen, Heikkila, and Anttila, 1992; Voutilainen
and Tapanainen, 1993; Oflazer and Kurth:5z, 1994;
Oflazer and Tiir, 1996) and transformation-based
techniques (Brill, 1992; Brill, 1994; Brill, 1995).
This paper presents a novel approach to constraint
based morphological disambiguation which relieves
the rule developer from worrying about conflicting
rule ordering requirements. The approach depends
on assigning votes to constraints according to their
complexity and specificity, and then letting con-
straints cast votes on matching parses of a given
lexical item. This approach does not reflect the out-
come of matching constraints to the set of morpho-
logical parses immediately. Only after all applicable
rules are applied to a sentence, all tokens are dis-
ambiguated in parallel. Thus, the outcome of the
rule applications is independent of the order of rule
applications. Rule ordering issue has been discussed
by Voutilainen(1994), but he has recently indicated&apos;
that insensitivity to rule ordering is not a property
of their system (although Voutilainen(1995a) states
that it is a very desirable property) but rather is
achieved by extensively testing and tuning the rules.
In the following sections, we present an overview
of the morphological disambiguation problem, high-
lighted with examples from Turkish. We then
present our approach and results. We finally con-
clude with a very brief outline of our investigation
into efficient implementations of our approach.

2 Morphological Disambiguation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.968246130434783">
In all languages, words are usually ambiguous in
their parts-of-speech or other morphological fea-
tures, and may represent lexical items of different
syntactic categories, or morphological structures de-
pending on the syntactic and semantic context. In
languages like English, there are a very small number
of possible word forms that can be generated from
a given root word, and a small number of part-of-
speech tags associated with a given lexical form. On
the other hand, in languages like Turkish or Finnish
with very productive agglutinative morphology, it
is possible to produce thousands of forms (or even
millions (Hankamer, 1989)) from a given root word
and the kinds of ambiguities one observes are quite
different than what is observed in languages like En-
glish.
In Turkish, there are ambiguities of the sort
typically found in languages like English (e.g.,
book/noun vs book/verb type). However, the ag-
glutinative nature of the language usually helps res-
olution of such ambiguities due to the restrictions
on morphotactics of subsequent morphemes. On the

other hand, this very nature introduces another kind
of ambiguity, where a lexical form can be morpho-
logically interpreted in many ways not usually pre-
dictable in advance. Furthermore, Turkish allows
very productive derivational processes and the infor-
mation about the derivational structure of a word
form is usually crucial for disambiguation (Oflazer
and Tiir, 1996).
Most kinds of morphological ambiguities that we
have observed in Turkish typically fall into one the
following classes:2
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.971550457142857">
1. the form is uninflected and assumes the default
inflectional features, e.g.,
1. taS (made of stone)
[CAT=ADJ] [ROOT=taS]]
2. taS (stone)
[ [CAT=NOUN] [ROOT=taS]
[AGR=3SG] [POSS=NONE] [CASE=NOM] ]
3. taS (overflow!)
[[CAT=VERB] [ROOT=t aS] [SENSE=POS]
[TAM1=IMP] [AGR=2SG]]
2. Lexically different affixes (conveying different
morphological features) surface the same due to
the morphographemic context, e.g.,
1. ev+ [n] in (of the house)
[ [CAT=NOUN] [ROOT=ev]
[AGR=3SG] [POSS=NONE] [CASE=GEN] ]
2. ev+in (your house)
[ [CAT=NOUN] [ROOT=ev]
[AGR=3SG] [P0SS=2SG] [CASE=NOM]]
3. The root of one of the parses is a prefix string of
the root of the other parse, and the parse with
the shorter root word has a suffix which surfaces
as the rest of the longer root word, e.g.,
1. koyu+ [u]n (your dark (thing) )
[CAT=ADJ] [ROOT=koyu] [CONV=NOUN=NONE]
[AGR=3SG] [POSS=2SG] [CASE=NOM]]
2. koyun (sheep)
[ [CAT=NOUN] [ROOT=koyun]
[AGR=3SG] [POSS=NONE] [CASE=NOM] ]
3. koy+ [n] un (of the bay)
[ [CAT=NOUN] [ROO T=koy]
[AGR=3SG] [POSS=NONE] [CASE=GEN] ]
4. koy+un (your bay)
[ [CAT=NOUN] [ROOT=koy]
[AGR=3SG] [POSS=2SG] ECASE=NOME

2Output of the morphological analyzer is edited for
clarity, and English glosses have been given. We have
also provided the morpheme structure, where [...]s, in-
dicate elision. Glosses are given as linear feature value
sequences corresponding to the morphemes (which are
not shown). The feature names are as follows: CAT-major
category, TYPE-minor category, ROOT-main root form, AGR
-number and person agreement, PUSS - possessive agree-
ment, CASE - surface case, CONV - conversion to the cat-
egory following with a certain suffix indicated by the
argument after that, TAM1-tense, aspect, mood marker
1, SENSE-verbal polarity. Upper cases in morphological
output indicates one of the non-ASCII special Turkish
characters: e.g., G denotes g, U denotes 5, etc.

[TAM1=IMP] [AGR=2PL] ]
</equation>
<listItem confidence="0.883266296296296">
4. The roots take different numbers of unrelated
inflectional and/or derivational suffixes which
when concatenated turn out to have the same
surface form, e.g.,
1. yap+madan (without having done (it ) )
HCAT=VERB] [ROOT=yap] [SENSE=POS]
[CONV=ADVERB=MADAN] ]
2. yap+ma+dan (from doing ( it ) )
[ [CAT=VERB] [ROOT=yap] [SENSE=POS]
[CONV=NOUN=MA] [TYPE=INFINITIVE]
[AGR=3SG] [POSS=NONE] [CASE=ABL]]
5. One of the ambiguous parses is a lexicalized
form while another is form derived by a pro-
ductive derivation as in 1 and 2 below.
6. The same suffix appears in different positions in
the morphotactic paradigm conveying different
information as in 2 and 3 below.
1. uygulama / (application)
[ [CAT=NOUN] [ROOT=uygulama]
[AGR=35G] [POSS=NONE] [CASE=NOM]]
2. uygula+ma / ( (the act of) applying)
HCAT=VERB] [ROOT=uygula] [SENSE=POS]
[CONV=NOUN=MA] [TYPE=INFINITIVE]
[AGR=3SG] [POSS=NONE] [CASE=NOM] ]

<bodyText confidence="0.999937133333333">
The main intent of our system is to achieve mor-
phological disambiguation by choosing for a given
ambiguous token, the correct parse in a given con-
text. It is certainly possible that a given token may
have multiple correct parses, usually with the same
inflectional features, or with inflectional features not
ruled out by the syntactic context, but one will be
the &amp;quot;correct&amp;quot; parse usually on semantic grounds.
We consider a token fully disambiguated if it has
only one morphological parse remaining after auto-
matic disambiguation. We consider a token as cor-
rectly disambiguated, if one of the parses remaining
for that token is the correct intended parse. We eval-
uate the resulting disambiguated text by a number
of metrics defined as follows (Voutilainen, 1995a):

3 Constraint-based Morphological
Disambiguation

This section outlines our approach to constraint-
based morphological disambiguation where con-
straints vote on matching parses of sequential to-
kens.

3.1 Constraints on morphological parses
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999335">
We describe constraints on the morphological parses
of tokens using rules with two components

<equation confidence="0.908136">

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.8852361875">
where the Ci are (possibly hierarchical) feature con-
straints on a sequence of the morphological parses,
and V is an integer denoting the vote of the rule.
To illustrate the flavor of our rules we can give the
following examples:
1. The following rule with two constraints matches
parses with case feature ablative, preceding a
parse matching a postposition subcategorizing
for an ablative nominal form.
[[case : abl] , [cat :postp,subcat : abl]]
2. The rule
[[agr: &apos;2SG&apos; ,case :gen] , [cat :noun,poss: &apos;2SG&apos;]]
matches a nominal form with a possessive
marker 2SG, following a pronoun with 2SG
agreement and genitive case, enforcing the sim-
plest form of noun phrase constraints.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.8818928">
3. In general constraints can make references to
the derivational structure of the lexical form
and hence be hierarchical. For instance, the fol-
lowing rule is an example of a rule employing a
hierarchical constraint:

3.2 Determining the vote of a rule
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999893375">
There are a number of ways votes can be assigned
to rules. For the purposes of this work the vote of
a rule is determined by its static properties, but it
is certainly conceivable that votes can be assigned
or learned by using statistics from disambiguated
corpora.4 For static vote assignment, intuitively, we
would like to give high votes to rules that are more
specific: i.e., to rules that have

• higher number of constraints,
• higher number of features in the constraints,
• constraints that make reference to nested stems
(from which the current form is derived),
• constraints that make reference to very specific
features or values.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9797295">
Let R = (C1, C2, • • • , Cn; V) be a constraint rule.
The vote V is determined as
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.996912">
V = EV(C2)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999664666666667">
where V(Ci) is the contribution of constraint Ci to
the vote of the rule R. A (generic) constraint has
the following form:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.953367">
C = [(Ii : vi)Sz(f2 : v2)&amp; • • • (fm : v„,)]
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9993335">
where fi is the name of a morphological feature, and
vz is one of the possible values for that feature. The
contribution of fi : vi in the vote of a constraint
depends on a number of factors:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.869202647058823">
1. The value vi may be a distinguished value that
has a more important function in disambigua-
tion.3 In this case, the weight of the feature
constraint is w(vi)(&gt; 1).
2. The feature itself may be a distinguished feature
which has more important function in disam-
biguation. In this case the weight of the feature
is w(fi)(&gt; 1).
3. If the feature fi refers to the stem of a de-
rived form and the value part of the feature con-
straint is a full fledged constraint C&apos; on the stem
structure, the weight of the feature constraint is
found by recursively computing the vote of C&apos;
and scaling the resulting value by a factor (2 in
our current system) to improve its specificity.
4. Otherwise, the weight of the feature constraint
is 1.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.833905142857143">
For example suppose we have the following con-
straint:
[cat:noun, case:gen,
stem: [cat : adj , stem: [cat :v] suffix=mis]]
Assuming the value gen is a distinguished value
with weight 4 (cf., factor 1 above), the vote of this
constraint is computed as follows:

<listItem confidence="0.9387802">
1. cat :noun contributes 1,

the genitive case marker is usually very helpful in
disambiguation.

(b) suffix=mis contributes 1,
(c) stem: [cat :v] contributes 2 = 2 * 1, the 1

(d) the sum 4 is scaled by 2 to give 8.
4. Votes from steps 1, 2 and 3(d) are added up to
give 13 as the constraint vote.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999957307692308">
We also employ a set of rules which express pref-
erences among the parses of single lexical form in-
dependent of the context in which the form occurs.
The weights for these rules are currently manually
determined. These rules give negative votes to the
parses which are not preferred or high votes to cer-
tain parses which are always preferred. Our experi-
ence is that such preference rules depend on the kind
of the text one is disambiguating. For instance if one
is disambiguating a manual of some sort, imperative
readings of verbs are certainly possible, whereas in
normal plain text with no discourse, such readings
are discouraged.

3.3 Voting and selecting parses
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999927117647059">
A rule R = (C1, C2, • • , Cn; V) will match a se-
quence of tokens wi, tvi+1, • • • , w_1 within a sen-
tence w1 through ws if some morphological parse of
every token wi i&lt; &lt; i n — 1 is subsumed by
the corresponding constraint Ci_i+1. When all con-
straints match, the votes of all the matching parses
are incremented by V. If a given constraint matches
more than one parse of a token, then the votes of all
such matching parses are incremented.
After all rules have been applied to all token po-
sitions in a sentence and votes are tallied, morpho-
logical parses are selected in the following manner.
Let vi and vh be the votes of the lowest and high-
est scoring parses for a given token. All parses with
votes equal to or higher than vi m * (vh — v1) are
selected with in (0 &lt; in &lt; 1) being a parameter.
in = 1 selects the highest scoring parse(s).

4 Results from Disambiguating
Turkish Text
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999948306451613">
We have applied our approach to disambiguating
Turkish text. Raw text is processed by a prepro-
cessor which segments the text into sentences using
various heuristics about punctuation, and then to-
kenizes and runs it through a wide-coverage high-
performance morphological analyzer developed us-
ing two-level morphology tools by Xerox (Kart-
tunen, 1993). The preprocessor module also per-
forms a number of additional functions such as
grouping of lexicalized and non-lexicalized colloca-
tions, compound verbs, etc., (Oflazer and Kurth:3z,
1994; Oflazer and Tar, 1996). The preprocessor also
uses a second morphological processor for dealing
with unknown words which recovers any derivational
and inflectional information from a word even if the
root word is not known. This unknown word pro-
cessor has a (nominal) root lexicon which recognizes
S+, where S is the Turkish surface alphabet (in the
two-level morphology sense), but then tries to in-
terpret an arbitrary postfix string of the unknown
word, as a sequence of Turkish suffixes subject to
all morphographemic constraints (Oflazer and Tiir,
1996).
We have applied our approach to four texts la-
beled ARK, HIST, MAN, EMB, with statistics
given in Table 1. The tokens considered are those
that are generated after morphological analysis, un-
known word processing and any lexical coalescing is
done. The words that are counted as unknown are
those that could not even be processed by the un-
known noun processor as they violate Turkish mor-
phographemic constraints. Whenever an unknown
word has more than one parse it is counted under the
appropriate group.&apos; The fourth and fifth columns in
this table give the average parses per token and the
initial precision assuming initial recall is 100%.
We have disambiguated these texts using a rule
base of about 500 hand-crafted rules. Most of the
rule crafting was done using the general linguistic
constraints and constraints that we derived from the
first text, ARK. In this sense, this text is our &amp;quot;train-
ing data&amp;quot;, while the other three texts were not con-
sidered in rule crafting.
Our results are summarized in Table 2. The last
four columns in this table present results for differ-
ent values for the parameter 771 mentioned above,
ni = 1 denoting the case when only the highest
scoring parse(s) is (are) selected. The columns for
in &lt; 1 are presented in order to emphasize that dras-
tic loss of precision for those cases. Even at m = 0.95
there is considerable loss of precision and going up
to m = 1 causes a dramatic increase in precision
without a significant loss in recall. It can be seen
that we can attain very good recall and quite ac-
ceptable precision with just voting constraint rules.
Our experience is that we can in principle add highly
specialized rules by covering a larger text base to
improve our recall and precision for the m = 1. A
post-mortem analysis has shown that cases that have
been missed are mostly due to morphosyntactic de-
pendencies that span a context much wider that 5
tokens that we currently employ.

By ignoring root/stem features during this pro-

inflectional information of the parses. This is very
similar to Brill&apos;s use of contexts to induce transfor-
mation rules for his tagger (Brill, 1992; Brill, 1995),
but instead of generating transformation rules from
a training text, we gather statistics and apply them
to parses in the text being disambiguated.

5 Efficient Implementation
Techniques and Extensions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999969764705883">
The current implementation of the voting approach
is meant to be a proof of concept implementation
and is rather inefficient. However, the use of regular
relations and finite state transducers (Kaplan and
Kay, 1994) provide a very efficient implementation
method. For this, we view the parses of the tokens
making up a sentence as making up a acyclic a fi-
nite state recognizer with the states marking word
boundaries and the ambiguous interpretations of the
tokens as the state transitions between states, the
rightmost node denoting the final state, as depicted
in Figure 1 for a sentence with 5 tokens. In Figure 1,
the transition labels are triples of the sort (wi , pj , 0)
for the it h parse of token i, with the 0 indicating
the initial vote of the parse. The rules imposing
constraints can also be represented as transducers
which increment the votes of the matching transi-

tion labels by an appropriate amount.7 Such trans-
ducers ignore and pass through unchanged, parses
that they are not sensitive to.
When a finite state recognizer corresponding to
the input sentence (which actually may be consid-
ered as an identity transducer) is composed with a
constraint transducer, one gets a slightly modified
version of the sentence transducer with possibly ad-
ditional transitions and states, where the votes of
some of the labels have been appropriately incre-
mented. When the sentence transducer is composed
with all the constraint transducers in sequence, all
possible votes are cast and the final sentence trans-
ducer reflects all the votes. The parse corresponding
to each token with the highest vote can then be se-
lected. The key point here is that due to the nature
of the composition operator, the constraint transduc-
ers can be composed off-line first, giving a single con-
straint transducer and then this one is composed with
every sentence transducer once (See Figure 2).
The idea of voting can further be extended to a
path voting framework where rules vote on paths
containing sequences of matching parses and the
path from the start state to the final stated with
the highest votes received, is then selected. This can
be implemented again using finite state transducers
as described above (except that path vote is appor-
tioned equally to relevant parse votes), but instead
of selecting highest scoring parses, one selects the
path from the start state to one of the final states
where the sum of the parse votes is maximum. We
have recently completed a prototype implementation
of this approach (in C) for English (Brown Corpus)
and have obtained quite similar results (Tiir, Of-
lazer, and oz-kan, 1997).

6 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99045045">
We have presented an approach to constraint-based
morphological disambiguation which uses constraint
voting as its primary mechanism for parse selec-
tion and alleviates the rule developer from worrying
about rule ordering issues. Our approach is quite
general and is applicable to any language. Rules de-
scribing language specific linguistic constraints vote
on matching parses of tokens, and at the end, parses
&apos;Suggested by Lauri Karttunen (private communica-
tion).
for every token receiving the highest tokens are se-
lected. We have applied this approach to Turkish,
a language with complex agglutinative word forms
exhibiting morphological ambiguity phenomena not
usually found in languages like English and have ob-
tained quite promising results. The convenience of
adding new rules in without worrying about where
exactly it goes in terms of rule ordering (some-
thing that hampered our progress in our earlier work
on disambiguating Turkish morphology (Oflazer and
Kuru6z, 1994; Oflazer and Tiir, 1996)), has also been
a key positive point. Furthermore, it is also possible
to use rules with negative votes to disallow impos-
sible cases. This has been quite useful for our work
on tagging English (Tiir, Oflazer, and Oz-kan, 1997)
where such rules with negative weights were used to
fine tune the behavior of the tagger in various prob-
lematic cases.
The proposed approach is also amenable to an
efficient implementation by finite state transducers
(Kaplan and Kay, 1994). By using finite state trans-
ducers, it is furthermore possible to use a bit more
expressive rule formalism including for instance the
Kleene * operator so that one can use a much smaller
set of rules to cover the same set of local linguistic
phenomena.
Our current and future work in this framework
involves the learning of constraints and their votes
from corpora, and combining learned and hand-
crafted rules.

On the other hand, in languages like Turkish or Finnish with very productive agglutinative morphology, it is possible to produce thousands of forms (or even millions (Hankamer, 1989)) from a given root word and the kinds of ambiguities one observes are quite different than what is observed in languages like English. In Turkish, there are ambiguities of the sort typically found in languages like English (e.g., book/noun vs book/verb type). However, the agglutinative nature of the language usually helps resolution of such ambiguities due to the restrictions on morphotactics of subsequent morphemes.

This is very similar to Brill&apos;s use of contexts to induce transformation rules for his tagger (Brill, 1992; Brill, 1995), but instead of generating transformation rules from a training text, we gather statistics and apply them to parses in the text being disambiguated. 5 Efficient Implementation Techniques and Extensions The current implementation of the voting approach is meant to be a proof of concept implementation and is rather inefficient. However, the use of regular relations and finite state transducers (Kaplan and Kay, 1994) provide a very efficient implementation method. For this, we view the parses of the tokens making up a sentence as making up a acyclic a finite state recognizer with the states marking word boundaries and the ambiguous interpretations of the tokens as the state transitions between states, the rightmost node denoting the final state, as depicted in Figure 1 for a sentence with 5 tokens. In Figure 1, the transition labels are triples of the sort (wi , pj , 0) for the it h parse of token i, with the 0 indicating the initial vote of the parse. The rules imposing constraints can also be represente</context>

Furthermore, it is also possible to use rules with negative votes to disallow impossible cases. This has been quite useful for our work on tagging English (Tiir, Oflazer, and Oz-kan, 1997) where such rules with negative weights were used to fine tune the behavior of the tagger in various problematic cases. The proposed approach is also amenable to an efficient implementation by finite state transducers (Kaplan and Kay, 1994). By using finite state transducers, it is furthermore possible to use a bit more expressive rule formalism including for instance the Kleene * operator so that one can use a much smaller set of rules to cover the same set of local linguistic phenomena. Our current and future work in this framework involves the learning of constraints and their votes from corpora, and combining learned and handcrafted rules. 7 Acknowledgments This research has been supported in part by a NATO Science for Stability Grant TU—LANGUAGE.

Our system is implemented in Prolog and we are currently investigating an efficient implementation based on finite state transducers. 1 Introduction Automatic morphological disambiguation is an important component in higher level analysis of natural language text corpora. There has been a large number of studies in tagging and morphological disambiguation using various techniques such as statistical techniques, e.g., (Church, 1988; Cutting et al., 1992; DeRose, 1988), constraint-based techniques (Karlsson et al., 1995; Voutilainen, 1995b; Voutilainen, Heikkila, and Anttila, 1992; Voutilainen and Tapanainen, 1993; Oflazer and Kurth:5z, 1994; Oflazer and Tiir, 1996) and transformation-based techniques (Brill, 1992; Brill, 1994; Brill, 1995). This paper presents a novel approach to constraint based morphological disambiguation which relieves the rule developer from worrying about conflicting rule ordering requirements.

Raw text is processed by a preprocessor which segments the text into sentences using various heuristics about punctuation, and then tokenizes and runs it through a wide-coverage highperformance morphological analyzer developed using two-level morphology tools by Xerox (Karttunen, 1993). The preprocessor module also performs a number of additional functions such as grouping of lexicalized and non-lexicalized collocations, compound verbs, etc., (Oflazer and Kurth:3z, 1994; Oflazer and Tar, 1996). The preprocessor also uses a second morphological processor for dealing with unknown words which recovers any derivational and inflectional information from a word even if the root word is not known. This unknown word processor has a (nominal) root lexicon which recognizes S+, where S is the Turkish surface alphabet (in the two-level morphology sense), but then tries to interpret an </context>

However, the agglutinative nature of the language usually helps resolution of such ambiguities due to the restrictions on morphotactics of subsequent morphemes. On the &apos;Voutilainen, Private communication. 222 other hand, this very nature introduces another kind of ambiguity, where a lexical form can be morphologically interpreted in many ways not usually predictable in advance. Furthermore, Turkish allows very productive derivational processes and the information about the derivational structure of a word form is usually crucial for disambiguation (Oflazer and Tiir, 1996). Most kinds of morphological ambiguities that we have observed in Turkish typically fall into one the following classes:2 1. the form is uninflected and assumes the default inflectional features, e.g., 1. taS (made of stone) [CAT=ADJ] [ROOT=taS]] 2. taS (stone) [ [CAT=NOUN] [ROOT=taS] [AGR=3SG] [POSS=NONE] [CASE=NOM] ] 3. taS (overflow!) [[CAT=VERB] [ROOT=t aS] [SENSE=POS] [TAM1=IMP] [AGR=2SG]] 2. Lexically different affixes (conveying different morphological features) surface the same due to the morphographemic context, e.g., 1. ev+ [n] in (of the house) [ [CAT=NOUN] [ROOT=ev] [AGR=3SG] [POS</context>

The preprocessor also uses a second morphological processor for dealing with unknown words which recovers any derivational and inflectional information from a word even if the root word is not known. This unknown word processor has a (nominal) root lexicon which recognizes S+, where S is the Turkish surface alphabet (in the two-level morphology sense), but then tries to interpret an arbitrary postfix string of the unknown word, as a sequence of Turkish suffixes subject to all morphographemic constraints (Oflazer and Tiir, 1996). We have applied our approach to four texts labeled ARK, HIST, MAN, EMB, with statistics given in Table 1. The tokens considered are those that are generated after morphological analysis, unknown word processing and any lexical coalescing is done. The words that are counted as unknown are those that could not even be processed by the unknown noun processor as they violate Turkish morphographemic constraints. Whenever an unknown word has more than one parse it is counted under the appropriate group.&apos; The fourth and fifth columns in this table give the average parses per token and the initial p</context>

We have applied this approach to Turkish, a language with complex agglutinative word forms exhibiting morphological ambiguity phenomena not usually found in languages like English and have obtained quite promising results. The convenience of adding new rules in without worrying about where exactly it goes in terms of rule ordering (something that hampered our progress in our earlier work on disambiguating Turkish morphology (Oflazer and Kuru6z, 1994; Oflazer and Tiir, 1996)), has also been a key positive point.
