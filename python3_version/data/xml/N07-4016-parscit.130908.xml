Abstract
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999976214285714">
Voice-Rate is an automated dialog system
which provides access to over one million
ratings of products and businesses. By
calling a toll-free number, consumers can
access ratings for products, national busi-
nesses such as airlines, and local busi-
nesses such as restaurants. Voice-Rate
also has a facility for recording and ana-
lyzing ratings that are given over the
phone. The service has been primed with
ratings taken from a variety of web
sources, and we are augmenting these
with user ratings. Voice-Rate can be ac-
cessed by dialing 1-877-456-DATA.

1 Overview
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999885022727273">
Voice-Rate is an automated dialog system de-
signed to help consumers while they are shopping.
The target user is a consumer who is considering
making an impulse purchase and would like to get
more information. He or she can take out a cell-
phone, call Voice-Rate, and get rating information
to help decide whether to buy the item. Here are
three sample scenarios:
Sally has gone to Home Depot to buy
some paint to touch-up scratches on the
wall at home. She’ll use exactly the same
color and brand as when she first painted
the wall, so she knows what she wants.
While at Home Depot, however, Sally sees
some hand-held vacuum cleaners and de-
cides it might be nice to have one. But, she
is unsure whether which of the available
models is better: The “Black &amp; Decker
CHV1400 Cyclonic DustBuster,” the
“Shark SV736” or the “Eureka 71A.” Sally
calls Voice-Rate and gets the ratings and
makes an informed purchase.
John is on vacation with his family in Seat-
tle. After going up in the Space Needle,
they walk by “Abbondanza Pizzeria” and
are considering lunch there. While it looks
good, there are almost no diners inside,
and John is suspicious. He calls Voice-
Rate and discovers that in fact the restau-
rant is highly rated, and decides to go
there.
Returning from his vacation, John drops
his rental car off at the airport. The rental
company incorrectly asserts that he has
scratched the car, and causes a big hassle,
until they finally realize that they already
charged the last customer for the same
scratch. Unhappy with the surly service,
John calls Voice-Rate and leaves a warn-
ing for others.
Currently, Voice-Rate can deliver ratings for over
one million products, two hundred thousand res-
taurants in over sixteen hundred cities; and about
three thousand national businesses.

2 Technical Challenges
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999834142857143">
To make Voice-Rate operational, it was necessary
to solve the key challenges of name resolution and
disambiguation. Users rarely make an exactly cor-
rect specification of a product or business, and it is
necessary both to utilize a “fuzzy-match” for name
lookup, and to deploy a carefully designed disam-
biguation strategy.

<bodyText confidence="0.999948829268293">
Voice-Rate solves the fuzzy-matching process by
treating spoken queries as well as business and
product names as documents, and then performing
TF-IDF based lookup. For a review of name
matching methods, see e.g. Cohen et al., 2003. In
the ideal case, after a user asks for a particular
product or business, the best-matching item as
measured by TF-IDF would be the one intended by
the user. In reality, of course, this is often not the
case, and further dialog is necessary to determine
the user’s intent. For concreteness, we will illu-
strate the disambiguation process in the context of
product identification.
When a user calls Voice-Rate and asks for a prod-
uct review, the system solicits the user for the
product name, does TF-IDF lookup, and presents
the highest-scoring match for user confirmation. If
the user does not accept the retrieved item, Voice-
Rate initiates a disambiguation dialog.
Aside from inadequate product coverage, which
cannot be fixed at runtime, there are two possible
sources for error: automatic speech recognition
(ASR) errors, and TF-IDF lookup errors. The dis-
ambiguation process begins by eliminating the
first. To do this, it asks the user if his or her exact
words were the recognized text, and if not to repeat
the request. This loop iterates twice, and if the us-
er’s exact words still have not been identified,
Voice-Rate apologizes and hangs up.
Once the user’s exact words have been validated,
Voice-Rate gets a positive identification on the
product category. From the set of high-scoring TF-
IDF items, a list of possible categories is compiled.
For example, for “The Lord of the Rings The Two
Towers,” there are items in Video Games, DVDs,
Music, VHS, Software, Books, Websites, and Toys
and Games. These categories are read to the user,
who is asked to select one. All the close-matching
product names in the selected category are then
read to the user, until one is selected or the list is
exhausted.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999750444444444">
To our knowledge, Voice-Rate is the first large
scale ratings dialog system. However, the technol-
ogy behind it is closely related to previous dialog
systems, especially directory assistance or “411”
systems (e.g. Kamm et al., 1994, Natarajan et al.,
2002, Levin et al., 2005, Jan et al., 2003). A gen-
eral discussion of name-matching techniques such
as TF-IDF can be found in (Cohen et al., 2003,
Bilenko et al., 2003).
The second area of related research has to do with
web rating systems. Interesting work on extracting
information from such ratings can be found in, e.g.
(Linden et al., 2003, Hu et al., 2004, Gammon et
al., 2005). Work has also been done using text-
based input to determine relevant products (Chai et
al., 2002). Our own work differs from this in that
it focuses on spoken input, and in its breadth –
covering both products and businesses.
