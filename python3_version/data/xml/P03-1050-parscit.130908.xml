Abstract

This paper presents an unsupervised learn-
ing approach to building a non-English
(Arabic) stemmer. The stemming model
is based on statistical machine translation
and it uses an English stemmer and a small
(10K sentences) parallel corpus as its sole
training resources. No parallel text is
needed after the training phase. Mono-
lingual, unannotated text can be used to
further improve the stemmer by allow-
ing it to adapt to a desired domain or
genre. Examples and results will be given
for Arabic , but the approach is applica-
ble to any language that needs affix re-
moval. Our resource-frugal approach re-
sults in 87.5% agreement with a state of
the art, proprietary Arabic stemmer built
using rules, affix lists, and human anno-
tated text, in addition to an unsupervised
component. Task-based evaluation using
Arabic information retrieval indicates an
improvement of 22-38% in average pre-
cision over unstemmed text, and 96% of
the performance of the proprietary stem-
mer above.

Stemming is the process of normalizing word vari-
ations by removing prefixes and suffixes. From an

information retrieval point of view, prefixes and suf-
fixes add little or no additional meaning; in most
cases, both the efficiency and effectiveness of text
processing applications such as information retrieval
and machine translation are improved.
Building a rule-based stemmer for a new, arbitrary
language is time consuming and requires experts
with linguistic knowledge in that particular lan-
guage. Supervised learning also requires large quan-
tities of labeled data in the target language, and qual-
ity declines when using completely unsupervised
methods. We would like to reach a compromise
by using a few inexpensive and readily available re-
sources in conjunction with unsupervised learning.
Our goal is to develop a stemmer generator that
is relatively language independent (to the extent that
the language accepts stemming) and is trainable us-
ing little, inexpensive data. This paper presents
an unsupervised learning approach to non-English
stemming. The stemming model is based on statisti-
cal machine translation and it uses an English stem-
mer and a small (10K sentences) parallel corpus as
its sole training resources.
A parallel corpus is a collection of sentence pairs
with the same meaning but in different languages
(i.e. United Nations proceedings, bilingual newspa-
pers, the Bible). Table 1 shows an example that uses
the Buckwalter transliteration (Buckwalter, 1999).
Usually, entire documents are translated by humans,
and the sentence pairs are subsequently aligned by
automatic means. A small parallel corpus can be
available when native speakers and translators are
not, which makes building a stemmer out of such
corpus a preferable direction.

We describe our approach towards reaching this
goal in section 2. Although we are using resources
other than monolingual data, the unsupervised na-
ture of our approach is preserved by the fact that
no direct information about non-English stemming
is present in the training data.
Monolingual, unannotated text in the target lan-
guage is readily available and can be used to further
improve the stemmer by allowing it to adapt to a de-
sired domain or genre. This optional step is closer to
the traditional unsupervised learning paradigm and
is described in section 2.4, and its impact on stem-
mer quality is described in 3.1.4.
Our approach (denoted by UNSUP in the rest of
the paper) is evaluated in section 3.1 by compar-
ing it to a proprietary Arabic stemmer (denoted by
GOLD). The latter is a state of the art Arabic stem-
mer, and was built using rules, suffix and prefix lists,
and human annotated text. GOLD is an earlier ver-
sion of the stemmer described in (Lee et al., ).
The task-based evaluation section 3.2 compares
the two stemmers by using them as a preprocessing
step in the TREC Arabic retrieval task. This section
also presents the improvement obtained over using
unstemmed text.

1.1 Arabic details
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999956555555556">
In this paper, Arabic was the target language but the
approach is applicable to any language that needs
affix removal. In Arabic, unlike English, both pre-
fixes and suffixes need to be removed for effective
stemming. Although Arabic provides the additional
challenge of infixes, we did not tackle them because
they often substantially change the meaning. Irregu-
lar morphology is also beyond the scope of this pa-
per. As a side note for readers with linguistic back-
ground (Arabic in particular), we do not claim that
the resulting stems are units representing the entire
paradigm of a lexical item. The main purpose of
stemming as seen in this paper is to conflate the to-
ken space used in statistical methods in order to im-
prove their effectiveness. The quality of the result-
ing tokens as perceived by humans is not as impor-
tant, since the stemmed output is intended for com-
puter consumption.

1.2 Related Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999932368421053">
The problem of unsupervised stemming or morphol-
ogy has been studied using several different ap-
proaches. For Arabic, good results have been ob-
tained for plural detection (Clark, 2001). (Gold-
smith, 2001) used a minimum description length
paradigm to build Linguistica, a system for which
the reported accuracy for European languages is cca.
83%. Note that the results in this section are not di-
rectly comparable to ours, since we are focusing on
Arabic.
A notable contribution was published by Snover
(Snover, 2002), who defines an objective function to
be optimized and performs a search for the stemmed
configuration that optimizes the function over all
stemming possibilities of a given text.
Rule-based stemming for Arabic is a problem
studied by many researchers; an excellent overview
is provided by (Larkey et al., ).
Morphology is not limited to prefix and suffix re-
moval; it can also be seen as mapping from a word to
an arbitrary meaning carrying token. Using an LSI
approach, (Schone and Jurafsky, ) obtained 88% ac-
curacy for English. This approach also deals with
irregular morphology, which we have not addressed.
A parallel corpus has been successfully used be-
fore by (Yarowsky et al., 2000) to project part of
speech tags, named entity tags, and morphology in-
formation from one language to the other. For a par-
allel corpus of comparable size with the one used
in our results, the reported accuracy was 93% for
French (when the English portion was also avail-
able); however, this result only covers 90% of the
tokens. Accuracy was later improved using suffix
trees.
(Diab and Resnik, 2002) used a parallel corpus
for word sense disambiguation, exploiting the fact
that different meanings of the same word tend to be
translated into distinct words.

2 Approach
</sectionHeader>
<figureCaption confidence="0.999336">
Figure 1: Approach Overview
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.998975">
Our approach is based on the availability of the
following three resources:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999603333333333">
• a small parallel corpus
• an English stemmer
• an optional unannotated Arabic corpus
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999459">
Our goal is to train an Arabic stemmer using these
resources. The resulting stemmer will simply stem
Arabic without needing its English equivalent.
We divide the training into two logical steps:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999967">
• Step 1: Use the small parallel corpus
• Step 2: (optional) Use the monolingual corpus
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.992622">
The two steps are described in detail in the fol-
lowing subsections.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.862727">
2.1 Step 1: Using the Small Parallel Corpus
</subsectionHeader>
<figureCaption confidence="0.94626">
Figure 2: Step 1 Iteration
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.999985">
In Step 1, we are trying to exploit the English
stemmer by stemming the English half of the paral-
lel corpus and building a translation model that will
establish a correspondence between meaning carry-
ing substrings (the stem) in Arabic and the English
stems.
For our purposes, a translation model is a matrix
of translation probabilities p(Arabic stem |English
stem) that can be constructed based on the small
parallel corpus (see subsection 2.2 for more details).
The Arabic portion is stemmed with an initial guess
(discussed in subsection 2.1.1)
Conceptually, once the translation model is built,
we can stem the Arabic portion of the parallel corpus
by scoring all possible stems that an Arabic word
can have, and choosing the best one. Once the Ara-
bic portion of the parallel corpus is stemmed, we can
build a more accurate translation model and repeat
the process (see figure 2). However, in practice, in-
stead of using a harsh cutoff and only keeping the
best stem, we impose a probability distribution over
the candidate stems. The distribution starts out uni-
form and then converges towards concentrating most
of the probability mass in one stem candidate.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.832008">
2.1.1 The Starting Point
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999894666666667">
The starting point is an inherent problem for un-
supervised learning. We would like our stemmer to
give good results starting from a very general initial
guess (i.e. random). In our case, the starting point
is the initial choice of the stem for each individual
word. We distinguish several solutions:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.978996">
• No stemming.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.986196">
This is not a desirable starting point, since affix
probabilities used by our model would be zero.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.978079">
• Random stemming
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.98344125">
As mentioned above, this is equivalent to im-
posing a uniform prior distribution over the
candidate stems. This is the most general start-
ing point.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.91743">
• A simple language specific rule - if available
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998150375">
If a simple rule is available, it would provide a
better than random starting point, at the cost of
reduced generality. For Arabic, this simple rule
was to use Al as a prefix and p as a suffix. This
rule (or at least the first half) is obvious even
to non-native speakers looking at transliterated
text. It also constitutes a surprisingly high base-
line.

2.2 The Translation Model *
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999516">
We adapted Model 1 (Brown et al., 1993) to our
purposes. Model 1 uses the concept of alignment
between two sentences e and f in a parallel corpus;
the alignment is defined as an object indicating for
each word ei which word fj generated it. To ob-
tain the probability of an foreign sentence f given the
English sentence e, Model 1 sums the products of
the translation probabilities over all possible align-
ments:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.905492">
�
Pr(f|e) —
{a}
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999985636363636">
The alignment variable ai controls which English
word the foreign word fi is aligned with. t(f|e) is
simply the translation probability which is refined
iteratively using EM. For our purposes, the transla-
tion probabilities (in a translation matrix) are the fi-
nal product of using the parallel corpus to train the
translation model.
To take into account the weight contributed by
each stem, the model’s iterative phase was adapted
to use the sum of the weights of a word in a sentence
instead of the count.

2.3 Candidate Stem Scoring
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993872647058823">
As previously mentioned, each word has a list of
substrings that are possible stems. We reduced the
problem to that of placing two separators inside each
Arabic word; the “candidate stems” are simply the
substrings inside the separators. While this may
seem inefficient, in practice words tend to be short,
and one or two letter stems can be disallowed.
An initial, naive approach when scoring the stem
would be to simply look up its translation probabil-
ity, given the English stem that is most likely to be
its translation in the parallel sentence (i.e. the En-
glish stem aligned with the Arabic stem candidate).
Figure 3 presents scoring examples before normal-
ization.
*Note that the algorithm to build the translation model is
not a “resource” per se, since it is a language-independent algo-
rithm.

However, this approach has several drawbacks
that prevent us from using it on a corpus other than
the training corpus. Both of the drawbacks below
are brought about by the small size of the parallel
corpus:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9884085">
• Out-of-vocabulary words: many Arabic stems
will not be seen in the small corpus
• Unreliable translation probabilities for low-
frequency stems.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999917615384615">
We can avoid these issues if we adopt an alternate
view of stemming a word, by looking at the prefix
and the suffix instead. Given the word, the choice
of prefix and suffix uniquely determines the stem.
Since the number of unique affixes is much smaller
by definition, they will not have the two problems
above, even when using a small corpus. These prob-
abilities will be considerably more reliable and are
a very important part of the information extracted
from the parallel corpus. Therefore, the score of a
candidate stem should be based on the score of the
corresponding prefix and the suffix, in addition to
the score of the stem string itself:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.990447">
score(“pas�&amp;quot;) = f(p) x f(a) x f(s)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999658375">
where a = Arabic stem, p = prefix, s=suffix
When scoring the prefix and the suffix, we could
simply use their probabilities from the previous
stemming iteration. However, there is additional in-
formation available that can be successfully used to
condition and refine these probabilities (such as the
length of the word, the part of speech tag if given
etc.).

We explored several stem scoring models, using
different levels of available information. Examples
include:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.910277714285714">
• Use the stem translation probability alone
score = t(a|e)
where a = Arabic stem, e = corresponding word

• Also use prefix (p) and suffix (s) conditional
probabilities; several examples are given in ta-
ble 2.

<tableCaption confidence="0.970049">
Table 2: Example Scoring Models
</tableCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.999991833333333">
The first two examples use the joint probability
of the prefix and suffix, with a smoothing back-off
(the product of the individual probabilities). Scor-
ing models of this form proved to be poor perform-
ers from the beginning, and they were abandoned in
favor of the last model, which is a fast, good approx-
imation to the third model in Table 2. The last two
models successfully solve the problem of the empty
prefix and suffix accumulating excessive probability,
which would yield to a stemmer that never removed
any affixes. The results presented in the rest of the
paper use the last scoring model.

2.4 Step 2: Using the Unlabeled Monolingual
Data
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999845538461538">
This optional second step can adapt the trained stem-
mer to the problem at hand. Here, we are moving
away from providing the English equivalent, and we
are relying on learned prefix, suffix and (to a lesser
degree) stem probabilities. In a new domain or cor-
pus, the second step allows the stemmer to learn new
stems and update its statistical profile of the previ-
ously seen stems.
This step can be performed using monolingual
Arabic data, with no annotation needed. Even
though it is optional, this step is recommended since
its sole resource can be the data we would need to
stem anyway (see Figure 5).
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.942605">

<bodyText confidence="0.99995">
Step 1 produced a functional stemming model.
We can use the corpus statistics gathered in Step 1
to stem the new, monolingual corpus. However, the
scoring model needs to be modified, since t(a|e) is
no longer available. By removing the conditioning,
the first/last letter scoring model we used becomes

<equation confidence="0.633097">
score= p(a) x p(s|last) x p(p|first)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999953666666667">
The model can be updated if the stem candidate
score/probability distribution is sufficiently skewed,
and the monolingual text can be stemmed iteratively
using the new model. The model is thus adapted to
the particular needs of the new corpus; in practice,
convergence is quick (less than 10 iterations).

In this subsection the accuracy is defined as agree-

prefix lists, and human annotated text, in addition
to an unsupervised component. GOLD is an ear-
lier version of the stemmer described in (Lee et al.,
). Freely available (but less accurate) Arabic light
stemmers are also used in practice.
When measuring accuracy, all tokens are consid-
ered, including those that cannot be stemmed by
simple affix removal (irregulars, infixes). Note that
our baseline (removing Al and p, leaving everything
unchanged) is higher that simply leaving all tokens
unchanged.

The high baseline is obtained by treating Al and p
as affixes. The 2K corpus had acceptable results (if
this is all the data available). Using 10K was sig-
nificantly better; however the improvement obtained
when five times as much data (50K) was used was
insignificant. Note that different languages might

3.2 Task-Based Evaluation : Arabic
Information Retrieval
Task Description:
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999992173913044">
Given a set of Arabic documents and an Arabic
query, find a list of documents relevant to the query,
and rank them by probability of relevance.
We used the TREC 2002 documents (several
years of AFP data), queries and relevance judg-
ments. The 50 queries have a shorter, “title” compo-
nent as wel as a longer “description”. We stemmed
both the queries and the documents using UNSUP
and GOLD respectively. For comparison purposes,
we also left the documents and queries unstemmed.
The UNSUP stemmer was trained with 10K UN
sentences in Step 1, and with one year’s worth of
monolingual AFP data (1995) in Step 2.
Evaluation metric: The evaluation metric used
below is mean average precision (the standard IR
metric), which is the mean of average precision
scores for each query. The average precision of a
single query is the mean of the precision scores after
each relevant document retrieved. Note that aver-
age precision implicitly includes recall information.
Precision is defined as the ratio of relevant docu-
ments to total documents retrieved up to that point

We looked at the effect of different testing con-
ditions on the mean average precision for the 50

query titles only, the second set adds the descrip-
tion, and the last set restricts the results to one year
(1995), using both the title and description. We
tested this last condition because the unsupervised
stemmer was refined in Step 2 using 1995 docu- sored in part by the National Science Foundation

This paper presents an unsupervised learning ap-
proach to building a non-English (Arabic) stemmer
using a small sentence-aligned parallel corpus in
which the English part has been stemmed. No paral-
lel text is needed to use the stemmer. Monolingual,
unannotated text can be used to further improve the
stemmer by allowing it to adapt to a desired domain
or genre. The approach is applicable to any language
that needs affix removal; for Arabic, our approach
results in 87.5% agreement with a proprietary Ara-
bic stemmer built using rules, affix lists, and hu-
man annotated text, in addition to an unsupervised
component. Task-based evaluation using Arabic in-
formation retrieval indicates an improvement of 22-
38% in average precision over unstemmed text, and
93-96% of the performance of the state of the art,
language specific stemmer above.
We can speculate that, because of the statistical
nature of the unsupervised stemmer, it tends to fo-
cus on the same kind of meaning units that are sig-
nificant for IR, whether or not they are linguistically
correct. This could explain why the gap betheen
GOLD and UNSUP is narrowed with task-based
evaluation and is a desirable effect when the stem-
mer is to be used for IR tasks.
We are planning to experiment with different lan-
guages, translation model alternatives, and to extend
task-based evaluation to different tasks such as ma-
chine translation and cross-lingual topic detection
and tracking.

This is the most general starting point. • A simple language specific rule - if available If a simple rule is available, it would provide a better than random starting point, at the cost of reduced generality. For Arabic, this simple rule was to use Al as a prefix and p as a suffix. This rule (or at least the first half) is obvious even to non-native speakers looking at transliterated text. It also constitutes a surprisingly high baseline. 2.2 The Translation Model * We adapted Model 1 (Brown et al., 1993) to our purposes. Model 1 uses the concept of alignment between two sentences e and f in a parallel corpus; the alignment is defined as an object indicating for each word ei which word fj generated it. To obtain the probability of an foreign sentence f given the English sentence e, Model 1 sums the products of the translation probabilities over all possible alignments: � Pr(f|e) — {a} The alignment variable ai controls which English word the foreign word fi is aligned with. t(f|e) is simply the translation probability which is refined iteratively using EM.

This paper presents an unsupervised learning approach to non-English stemming. The stemming model is based on statistical machine translation and it uses an English stemmer and a small (10K sentences) parallel corpus as its sole training resources. A parallel corpus is a collection of sentence pairs with the same meaning but in different languages (i.e. United Nations proceedings, bilingual newspapers, the Bible). Table 1 shows an example that uses the Buckwalter transliteration (Buckwalter, 1999). Usually, entire documents are translated by humans, and the sentence pairs are subsequently aligned by automatic means. A small parallel corpus can be available when native speakers and translators are not, which makes building a stemmer out of such corpus a preferable direction.
