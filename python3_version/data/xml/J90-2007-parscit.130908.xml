lents in classical or nonclassical logical languages, and for
which a logical translation into terms of logical constants is
impossible (&amp;quot;ii existe un grand nombre de connecteurs en
langue naturelle n&apos;ayant pas de correspondants dans les
langages logiques classiques ou non classiques et pour
lesquels la traduction logique en termes de constante
logique n&apos;est pas possible&amp;quot;). With these words Moeschler
subscribes to the implicitness principle (Schubert 1988b),
which basically says that an artificial representation has an
inherently insufficient expressive power for rendering the
full and unrestricted content of a text in a human language.
Some of Moeschler&apos;s examples illustrate very well how the
content of connector constructions is impoverished when
rendered in predicate logic.
It would be a promising continuation of the work begun
by Moeschler if his connector analyses were applied cross-
linguistically and, in particular, in translation studies. The
implicitness principle shows that expanding the scope of
work in this way by no means requires any logical represen-
tation to be chosen as the main object of research rather
than the words themselves. On the contrary, a cross-
linguistic investigation of translation equivalences can, in
my view, profit from an approach like Moeschler&apos;s.
Part 1 of the book analyzes the logical content of connec-
tors, Part 2 discusses their function as markers of perti-
nence and, indirectly, of coherence, and Part 3 suggests a
tree-structured discourse representation. This representa-
tion might be seen as one of many (for an overview of text
models see Papegaaij and Schubert 1988: 13-14), if it were
not for the specific view on connectors that underlies
Moeschler&apos;s model. With the exception of a brief reference
to scripts, the book at first sight does not seem to have any
direct link to computational linguistics. Nevertheless, I am
convinced that a study that approaches language at the
grammatical and pragmatic level and leads toward a linguis-
tically motivated formalization is worth the attention of
computational linguists. I feel that materials of this kind
are needed on a much larger scale than is currently avail-
able, to let computational linguists&apos; skills in formalization
and implementation be applied on a pertinent linguistic
basis.

First, the form of the book: The Computational Linguistics
Handbook is very large. It contains 65 papers, organized in
12 sections, covering all aspects of computational linguis-
tics in the widest sense of the term. It has nearly a thousand
pages, most in two-column format, and weighs 2.2 kg. It&apos;s
probably the first book in computational linguistics to
include fold-out maps.
The book is in English and German: front matter is in
both languages, and articles are in one or the other (about
half in each language). One would have hoped that each
article would be accompanied by at least a translation of
the title and a short abstract in the other language, so that
the unilingual user could judge the relevance of the article
and possibly seek assistance with translation. But, unfortu-
nately, only titles are translated, and only in the table of
contents, not in the article itself. This makes browsing
difficult for users who do not have some facility in both
languages—and one of the values of the book is that it
invites browsing.
The book is properly typeset throughout—there&apos;s no
author&apos;s rough camera-ready copy here—which accounts
at least in part for its high price. Nevertheless, typos (or
copyediting infelicities) turn up a little more often than one
would have hoped. And on a couple of occasions, the
running heads are completely out of sync with the text.
Now the content: The goal of the Computational Linguis-
tics Handbook (pp. xiv–xv) is to describe comprehensively
the current state of research in the field, to survey the
literature, to locate the field itself with respect to related
disciplines and show its application in those fields, and to
suggest how the field may be further developed. That&apos;s a
big goal for a big book.
In the space for this review, I cannot even list each article
Computational Linguistics Volume 16, Number 2, June 1990 121
Book Reviews Computational Linguistics: An International Handbook on Computer Oriented Language Research and Applications
of the handbook, let alone discuss each. But a work like this
succeeds or fails not so much with the individual articles as
with the whole that they create, and I shall concentrate on
that. I will follow the structure of the book, which is based
on the editors&apos; view of the structure of the field.
The first three parts of the book (126 pages) are back-
ground. Part I, with articles by Baton, Endres-Nigge-
meyer, and Haji6ova, covers CL as an enterprise: the
history and organization of the field, and its connections to
other disciplines. Included is a long listing of many CL
research groups around the world, giving representative
publications of each. Fold-out maps mark the location of
each group (not always with geographical precision), using
colored symbols to indicate the specialties of each. There is
a special survey of CL research in Eastern Europe. Parts II
and III, with articles by Martin, Krallman, Klenk, Bertsch,
Karlgren, Köhler and Gabriel Altmann, and Krause, de-
scribe the foundations of the content of CL and its method-
ology: what CL aims to do, what the basic problems studied
are, the tension between research and application, the role
of quantitative methods.
The next five parts cover basic research, and are divided
into three parts (IV, V, and VI) on issues in the static
description of language and two parts (VII and VIII) on
issues in processing, entitled &apos;computer simulation of lan-
guage.&apos;
The parts on description (133 pages) cover all levels from
phonological segmentation of speech up to Schankian
scripts. Several articles discuss the value of corpus-based
research, and there is a survey of corpora that are available
for research. Formalisms and theories of morphology, syn-
tax (ATNs, DCGs, unification grammars), and semantics
(semantic markers, conceptual dependency, etc.) are in-
cluded. Two articles (those of Part VI) emphasize the
testing and validation of theoretical descriptive models by
computer implementation of them. The articles are by
Sgall, Bergenholtz and Mugdan, Allen, Lenders, Piirainen,
Wothke, Schraeder and Willee, Ramsay, Karlsson, Fried-
man, and Eikmeyer, Kindermann, and Petofi.
Part VII (51 pages), with articles by Lenders, Gerry
Altmann, Oim, Berry-Rogghe, and Metzing and Gorz, is
the first on processing. It discusses foundational issues, the
relationship between CL and the neighboring disciplines of
artificial intelligence and psycholinguistics, and the role of
knowledge representation formalisms in general and seman-
tic networks in particular. Part VIII (170 pages) then
presents the components of natural language understand-
ing and generation systems; the articles are by Baton,
Wettler, Ingria, Hellwig, Rollinger, King, Lutz, and Kem-
pen. There is first an overview of the various architectures
that have been proposed for NLU systems, and of the many
varieties and flavors of knowledge representation. Then
individual system components each get an article: lexicons,
parsers (in very considerable detail), semantic interpreters,
and inference engines. Generation is covered in a single
short article.
The next three parts, IX to XI, cover applications of CL,
and it is here that we see how wide the field is, or may be
construed to be. Antonio Zampolli has observed (in an
address to the International Conference on Computers and
the Humanities, June 1989) that Italian has only a single
term, linguistica cornputazionale, for the enterprises that
in English are divided into &amp;quot;computational linguistics&amp;quot; and
&amp;quot;linguistic computing,&amp;quot; and that research in Italy has
benefited from the unity of linguistica computazionale.
Likewise, in this handbook, the applications presented serve
to emphasize the continuity between what anglophones
regard as separate fields.
Part IX contains a single short article by Baton i introduc-
ing applications of CL. The applications presented are
divided into those that involve the description of language
(Part X), and those involving any aspect of human–
machine communication (Part XI). The first division (96
pages) covers lexicography (including indexes, concor-
dances, dictionaries, and lexical databases), grammaticog-
raphy. dialectology (more fold-out maps!), reconstruction
of texts, authorship attribution, the analysis of style, histor-
ical linguistics, and content analysis. The articles are by
Jones and Sondrup, Calzolari, Wegera and Berg, Wick-
mann, Najock, Allen, Hewson, Mohler, and Handler, Hum-
mel and Putschke. The second division (166 pages) covers
speech recognition and synthesis, machine and machine-
aided translation (six articles, including surveys of current
systems), information retrieval (two articles, one of them a
survey of current systems), question-answering systems
(two articles), office automation, and computer-assisted
instruct ion. The authors are Ney, MUller, Melby, Slocum,
Fabricz, Tsujii, Boitet, Marchuk, Kuhlen, Panyr and Zim-
merman, Habel and Pribbenow, Lesch, Ballard, and Zetter-
sten.
Part XII (47 pages) is about the &apos;operating environment&apos;
of CL, which is taken to include hardware and software
(programming languages, graphics packages), data inter-
change standards, and the like. The articles are by Hockey,
Drewek, Messerschmidt and Hotz, Seppanen, and Han-
dler.
A work of this kind needs a first-rate bibliography and
subject index. The bibliography here is 101 pages long, and
contains about 3,700 entries. But the subject index is not so
successful. It contains English and German terms all mixed
up together, most without cross-reference; the user must
look for both—for example, &amp;quot;question-answering-system&amp;quot;
and &amp;quot;Frage/Antwort-Systeme.&amp;quot; Incidentally, the latter en-
try, but not the former, includes a listing of all the question-
answering systems mentioned in either language in the
text. Cognate terms are conflated under the German; for
example, there is no entry at &amp;quot;grammar,&amp;quot; but a long one a
few lines later at &amp;quot;Grammatik / grammar.&amp;quot; In the case of
terms that are relatively distant alphabetically, such as
&amp;quot;Regel / rule,&amp;quot; the user who knows no German is rather at
a disadvantage. The index terms are those &amp;quot;suggested by
the authors,&amp;quot; rather than by an indexer who may have had
a clearer picture of the whole work and the access points
that a reader may need, and who may have imposed a
greater uniformity of terminology. For example, preference
semantics is discussed in (at least) two articles; one is

indexed under &amp;quot;Praferenzsemantik,&amp;quot; the other under
&amp;quot;preferences.&amp;quot;
A work as big as this is sure to contain something to
offend everyone. Some of the articles, rather than being
well-fitting pieces in structure, are perhaps a little too
idiosyncratic; for example, Allen&apos;s lengthy complaints about
the paucity of computer-assisted stylistic studies of Spanish
text. And some authors are more adept than others at
making their topic comprehensible to the newcomer; the
same article by Allen is particularly reader-friendly. But
despite the handbook&apos;s size, what I noticed most were the
omissions. The short article on computer-assisted language
teaching does little justice to current research into the
application of sophisticated CL methods to the problem. I
could find nothing on dealing with ill-formed input (or did
the index let me down?). Transformational grammar is
mentioned a number of times, but government—binding
theory is not. Research in discourse structure is hardly
mentioned, except, unexpectedly, in the article on language
generation. No form of the term &amp;quot;anaphora&amp;quot; appears in the
index (though there is at least a passing mention of the
problem (p. 270) in Lenders&apos;s introduction to the sections
on processing). But such complaints should not be allowed
to obscure the wealth that can be found in this handbook. I
just wish that it were a little easier to find what one is
looking for.

An essential assumption of every syntactic theory is that the
sentences of natural language are internally structured. In the
early years of generative grammar it was generally believed that
the appropriate mechanism for generating syntactic structures
was a grammar of rewriting rules that operated free of context.
Recently, however, this belief and others concerning the nature of
phrase structure have increasingly come into question.
The twelve essays in this volume grew out of a conference
convened to discuss the challenge to the classical formulation of
phrase structure and the alternative conceptions proposed to
replace it. Each of the articles approaches this issue from the
perspective of a different linguistic framework, such as categorial
grammar, government-binding theory, head-driven phrase struc-
ture grammar, and tree-adjoining grammar. Evidence from a
number of languages and subdomains of grammar are brought to
bear on a variety of questions. What are the primitives out of
which structured representations are constructed?
What is the formal device that generates the infinite set of
representations for the infinite set of sentences of each natural
language? What is the relationship between lexical selection and
structure generation? The contributors also consider the possibil-
ity of reassigning the work done by rewriting rules to other formal
devices, the nature of selection, the character of unbounded
dependencies, and the treatment of word order variation in so-
called free word-order languages.—From the publisher&apos;s an-
nouncement

This book reviews natural language processing technology view-
points from both the academic and the business perspective. It is
not a highly technical or academic book per se, but rather, it
reviews the technology as a whole for the nonexpert in natural
language. The book presents the state of the art, forecasts of the
technology, and the outlook from a commercialization standpoint.
The reader who would benefit most is the technical manager or
professional contemplating the commercialization of an NLP
product. If the book is not mistaken as a &amp;quot;how to&amp;quot; textbook, it may
prove useful and satisfying; similar industry reports and forecasts
from private sources may cost hundreds of dollars.
A broad range of topics is covered. The book begins with an
overview of NLP approaches, formalisms, and methods. This is
followed by a detailed coverage of applications from natural
language interfaces and machine translation to text processing,
generation, writing aids, and speech. For each, the approaches,
state of the art, existing products, and prognosis for future
products are presented. The book ends with a section on current
issues, the business picture, and the &amp;quot;science&amp;quot; of NLP. A major
thesis of the book is that there is a marked difference between
business people and academics in the field; breakthroughs in the
science are needed and they should be driven by practical market
needs. For example, the metric of success in NLP should be
productivity improvement, not linguistic perfection.
The overall range of topics and information makes the book
useful from a practical standpoint. However, there are some
problems with the writing style and content in spots. The author
occasionally writes paragraphs that are incoherent—that is, they
wander into a number of different unrelated topics. Further, some
of the information was not carefully researched. Two examples:
On page 109, the author implies that the Unix Consultant is a
system that translates English commands to Unix, when it is

The articles are by Jones and Sondrup, Calzolari, Wegera and Berg, Wickmann, Najock, Allen, Hewson, Mohler, and Handler, Hummel and Putschke. The second division (166 pages) covers speech recognition and synthesis, machine and machineaided translation (six articles, including surveys of current systems), information retrieval (two articles, one of them a survey of current systems), question-answering systems (two articles), office automation, and computer-assisted instruct ion. The authors are Ney, MUller, Melby, Slocum, Fabricz, Tsujii, Boitet, Marchuk, Kuhlen, Panyr and Zimmerman, Habel and Pribbenow, Lesch, Ballard, and Zettersten. Part XII (47 pages) is about the &apos;operating environment&apos; of CL, which is taken to include hardware and software (programming languages, graphics packages), data interchange standards, and the like. The articles are by Hockey, Drewek, Messerschmidt and Hotz, Seppanen, and Handler. A work of this kind needs a first-rate bibliography and subject index. The bibliography here is 101 pages long, and contains about 3,700 entries. But the subject index is not so successful. It contains English and German terms all mixed up together, most without cross-reference; the user must look for both—for example, &amp;quot;question-answering-system&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Frage/Antwort-Systeme.&amp;quot; Incidentally, the latter entry, but not the former, includes a listing of all the questionanswering systems mentioned in either language in the text. Cognate terms are conflated under the German; for example, there is no entry at &amp;quot;grammar,&amp;quot; but a long one a few lines later at &amp;quot;Grammatik / grammar.&amp;quot; In the case of terms that are relatively distant alphabetically, such as &amp;quot;Regel / rule,&amp;quot; the user who knows no German is rather at a disadvantage. The index terms are those &amp;quot;suggested by the authors,&amp;quot; rather than by an indexer who may have had a clearer picture of the whole work and the access points that a reader may need, and who may have imposed a greater uniformity of terminology. For example, preference semantics is discussed in (at least) two articles; one is 122 Computational Linguistics Volume 16, Number 2, June 1990 Book Reviews Briefly Noted indexed under &amp;quot;Praferenzsemantik,&amp;quot; the other under &amp;quot;preferences.&amp;quot; A work as big as this is sure to contain something to offend everyone. Some of the articles, rather than being well-fitting pieces in structure, are perhaps a little too idiosyncratic; for example, Allen&apos;s lengthy complaints about the paucity of computer-assisted stylistic studies of Spanish text. And some authors are more adept than others at making their topic comprehensible to the newcomer; the same article by Allen is particularly reader-friendly. But despite the handbook&apos;s size, what I noticed most were the omissions. The short article on computer-assisted language teaching does little justice to current research into the application of sophisticated CL methods to the problem. I could find nothing on dealing with ill-formed input (or did the index let me down?). Transformational grammar is mentioned a number of times, but government—binding theory is not. Research in discourse structure is hardly mentioned, except, unexpectedly, in the article on language generation. No form of the term &amp;quot;anaphora&amp;quot; appears in the index (though there is at least a passing mention of the</abstract>

On the contrary, a crosslinguistic investigation of translation equivalences can, in my view, profit from an approach like Moeschler&apos;s. Part 1 of the book analyzes the logical content of connectors, Part 2 discusses their function as markers of pertinence and, indirectly, of coherence, and Part 3 suggests a tree-structured discourse representation. This representation might be seen as one of many (for an overview of text models see Papegaaij and Schubert 1988: 13-14), if it were not for the specific view on connectors that underlies Moeschler&apos;s model. With the exception of a brief reference to scripts, the book at first sight does not seem to have any direct link to computational linguistics. Nevertheless, I am convinced that a study that approaches language at the grammatical and pragmatic level and leads toward a linguistically motivated formalization is worth the attention of computational linguists. I feel that materials of this kind are needed on a much larger scale than is currently available, to let computational linguists&apos; skills in formal</context>
