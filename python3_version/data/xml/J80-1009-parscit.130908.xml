1980 ACL Meeting Date Changed
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99278069047619">
The 18th Annual Meeting of the Association for
Computational Linguistics will be held June 19-22,
1980, on the campus of the University of Pennsylvania
in Philadelphia. This is a change from the previously
announced date of June 18-21, and was brought about
by a desire to minimize the overlap in time with the
Cognitive Science Society meeting, which will be held
in New Haven earlier the same week (see next item).
The ACL meeting will be divided into two parts.
During the first two days (Thursday and Friday), re-
fereed, contributed papers will be presented, and the
Annual Business Meeting will be held. Gary Hendrix
of SRI International is the Chairman of the Program
Committee, and a Call for Papers (with a February 15
deadline) went out to all ACL members in December.
The other members of the Program Committee are
Charles Fillmore, University of California, Jane Robin-
son, SRI International, Ivan Sag, Stanford University,
Henry Thompson, Xerox PARC, and Rober Wilensky,
University of California.
During the second two days of the meeting
(Saturday and Sunday), a parasession on &amp;quot;Topics in
Interactive Discourse&amp;quot; with invited papers and panels
will be held. This part of the meeting is being organ-
ized by Bonnie Webber of the University of Pennsyl-
vania, and will consist of three panels, Front-end De-
sign: Demands of Service Application, chaired by Bar-
bara Grosz of SRI International, Front-end Design:
Demands of Convention and Channel, chaired by Jerry
Hobbs of SRI International, and Natural Language
Interactive Systems: Looking to the Future, chaired by
Bonnie Webber. Among the panelists will be John
Carey (Alternate Media Center, NYU), Phil Hayes
(Carnegie-Mellon University), Howard Morgan
(University of Pennsylvania), Emmanuel Schegloff
(UCLA), and John C. Thomas (IBM Research).
The Annual Banquet will be held on Friday eve-
ning, amongst the Egyptian mummies in the Rotunda
of the University Museum.
Local arrangements for the meeting are being han-
dled by Kathleen McKeown of the University of Penn-
sylvania.

The Cognitive Science Society will hold its second
annual conference at Yale University in New Haven,
Connecticut, on June 16-19, 1980. There will be
three major addresses, three panel discussions, and
sessions of short papers sponsored by members of the
Society. (A Call for Abstracts has already gone out to
members, with a deadline of March 1.) There will also
be computer demonstrations and a banquet. Dormito-

COLING 80 to be Held in Tokyo
The 1980 International Conference on Computa-
tional Linguistics (COLING 80) will be held in Tokyo,
September 29 - October 4. Both artificial intelligence
and theoretical linguistics provide the underpinnings
for studies to be reported at COLING 80, and applica-
tions including office automation will be presented
together with pure scientific results. Voice recognition
and the problem of Chinese character input-output are
likely to have a large place in the final program, ac-
cording to David G. Hays, program chairman.
Computational linguistics is the study of interac-
tions between human language and the computer. On
the linguistic side, papers on discourse structure, se-
mantics, syntax, and phonology are usually included in
conferences; papers on the history of language, lexi-
cography, literary studies, and dialect variation are
frequently offered. In artificial intelligence, natural-
language input for programming, data-base access, and
data input are topics of high current interest. Readers
for the blind and other voice input-output applications
have appeared.

Office automation, including word processing, is a
rapidly growing application area that can use the re-
sults of 20 years&apos; work in computational linguistics,
Hays says, and machine translation is coming to the
fore again.
The first conference in the COLING series was
held in New York in 1965. Since then conferences
have been held in Canada, France, Hungary, Italy,
Norway, and Sweden. The Tokyo conference will be
held during the week preceding the IFIP conference on
computing. COLING meetings are sponsored by the
International Committee on Computational Linguistics,
of which Bernard Vauquois, professor at Grenoble,
France, is chairman. Professor Hiroshi Wada is honor-
ary president of COLING 80. Professor Makoto Na-
gao is local arrangements chairman.

man/computer natural communication, with three main
topic areas: Man/computer Communication Systems in
Natural Written Text (question answering systems,
natural language data base access, etc.), Speech Com-
munication with Computers (speech understanding
systems, digital synthesis of speech, speaker recogni-
tion, etc.), and Digital Image Processing Systems.
There will be invited papers suitable for 60-minute
presentation, regular papers suitable for 35-minute
presentation (with acceptance based on a 3-page, de-
tailed summary due February 15), and short communi-
cations suitable for 10-15 minute presentation (with
acceptance based on a 1 or 2-page summary, possible
in the course of the Workshop). All accepted papers
will be published in the Proceedings. The official lan-

Newell of Carnegie-Mellon University as the first
President, Ed Feigenbaum of Stanford University as
President-elect, and Don Walker of SRI International
as the first Secretary-Treasurer. A general election, in
which all members may vote, will be held this winter.

Semantics of natural language and methods for
representing knowledge are the topics of a series of
informal workshops held at the IBM Systems Research
Institute in New York City. The workshops are open
to anyone who is actively doing research on these top-
ics in the fields of artificial intelligence, cognitive psy-
chology, computational linguistics, data base design,
linguistics, philosophy, psycholinguistics, and symbolic
logic. The purpose of the workshops is to provide a
forum for people who are working on these and related
topics at universities and research institutions in New
York and surrounding areas. Visitors from other loca-
tions are welcome to come, but we would like to es-
tablish a nucleus of participants who can attend regu-
larly.
The format for the workshops is a meeting about
once a month, normally on Friday mornings. The first
meeting is scheduled for February 1, 1980 with a lec-
ture, &amp;quot;Inferring Conceptual Meaning Structures,&amp;quot; by
Professor Sharon Salveter from SUNY at Stony Brook.
The IBM Systems Research Institute is providing a

Natural Language questions differ from most exist-
ing formal query languages in that they tend to admit a
wider range of responses than their formal counter-
parts, and provide cues for selecting among the variety
of appropriate responses. These differences reflect the
fact that in Natural Language conversation, a respon-
dent is expected to take an active role in the process
of selecting and organizing responses, in contrast to
formal query systems, where control of the interaction
typically resides with the user or applications program-
mer. This paper explores some specific ways in which
Natural Language questions are particularly well suited
for their environment, and discusses the potential role
of similar capabilities in formal query systems, particu-
larly with respect to Natural Language Data Base
query systems.
