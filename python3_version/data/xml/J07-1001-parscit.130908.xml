In her review of our book Memory-based Language Processing, which appeared in
Computational Linguistics, Issue 32(4), Sandra K¨ubler comments on the illegibility of the
phonetic font. Unfortunately, she had an early copy; the book was reprinted as soon
as this problem was noticed, and Cambridge University Press has offered to replace
any remaining misprinted copies with reprints upon request. This applies to copies
with incorrectly overlapping phonetic symbols on pages 28, 59–63, and 108. They may
be sent to Helen Barton, 3rd Floor, The Edinburgh Building, Cambridge University
Press, Shaftesbury Road, Cambridge, UK, CB2 2RU. Postage will also be reimbursed
if a receipt for the cost is provided.
