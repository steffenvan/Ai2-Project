1. Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99966025">
Computational linguistics activities in India are being
carried out at many institutions. The activities are
centred around development of machine translation
systems and lexical resources.
</bodyText>

2. Machine Translation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99643875">
Four major efforts on machine translation in India are
presented below. The first one is from one Indian
language to another, the next three are from English
to Hindi.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.983594">
2.1. Anusaaraka Systems among Indian languages
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999947076923077">
In the anusaaraka systems, the load between the
human reader and the machine is divided as
follows: language-based analysis of the text is carried
out by the machine, and knowledge-based analysis
or interpretation is left to the reader. The machine
uses a dictionary and grammar rules, to produce the
output. Most importantly, it does not use world
knowledge to interpret (or disambiguate), as it is an
error prone task and involves guessing or inferring
based on knowledge other than the text. Anusaaraka
aims for perfect &amp;quot;information preservation&amp;quot;. We relax
the requirement that the output be grammatical. In
fact, anusaaraka output follows the grammar of the
source language (where the grammar rules differ, and
cannot be applied with 100 percent confidence). This
requires that the reader undergo a short training to
read and understand the output.
Among Indian languages, which share vocabulary,
grammar, pragmatics, etc. the task (and the training)
is easier. For example, words in a language are
ambiguous, but if the two languages are close, one is
likely to find a one to one correspondence between
words such that the meaning is carried across from the
source language to target language. For example, for
80 percent of the Kannada words in the anusaaraka
dictionary of 30,000 root words, there is a single
equivalend Hindi word which covers the senses of the
original Kannada word. Similarly, wherever the two
languages differ in grammatical constructions, either
an existing construction in the target language which
expresses the same meaning is used, or a new
construction is invented (or an old construction used
with some special notation). For example, adjectival
participial phrases in the south Indian languages are
mapped to relative clauses in Hindi with the ’*’
notation (Bharati, 2000). Similarly, existing words in
the target language may be given wider or narrower
meaning (Narayana, 1994). Anusaarakas are available
for use as email servers (anusaaraka, URL).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.991583">
2.2. Mantra System
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999889181818182">
The Mantra system translates appointment letters in
government from English to Hindi. It is based on
synchronous Tree Adjoining Grammar and uses tree-
transfer for translating from English to Hindi.
The system is tailored to deal with its narrow subject-
domain. The grammar is specially designed to accept
analyze and generate sentential constructions in
&amp;quot;officialese&amp;quot;. Similarly, the lexicon is suitably
restricted to deal with meanings of English words as
used in its subject-domain. The system is ready for
use in its domain.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.995961">
2.3. MaTra System
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999548">
The Matra system is a tool for human aided machine
translation from English to Hindi for news stories. It
has a text categorisation component at the front,
which determines the type of news story (political,
terrorism, economic, etc.) before operating on the
given story. Depending on the type of news, it uses an
appropriate dictionary. For example, the word ’party’
is usually a ’politicalentity’ and not a ’social event’, in
political news.
The text categorisation component uses word-vectors
and is easily trainable from pre-categorized news
corpus. The parser tries to identify chunks (such as
noun phrases, verb groups) but does not attempt to
join them together. It requires considerable human
assistance in analysing the input. Another novel
component of the system is that given a complex
English sentence, it breaks it up into simpler
sentences, which are then analysed and used to
generate Hindi. The system is under development and
expected to be ready for use soon (Rao, 1998).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.9912">
2.4. Anusaaraka System from English to Hindi
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999500789473684">
The English to Hindi anusaaraka system follows the
basic principles of information preservation. It uses
XTAG based super tagger and light dependency
analyzer developed at University of Pennsylvania
[Joshi, 94] for performing the analysis of the given
English text. It distributes the load on man and
machine in novel ways. The system produces several
outputs corresponding to a given input. The simplest
possible (and the most robust) output is based on the
machine taking the load of lexicon, and leaving the
load of syntax on man. Output based on the most
detailed analysis of the English input text, uses a full
parser and a bilingual dictionary. The parsing system
is based on XTAG (consisting of super tagger and
parser) wherein we have modified them for the task at
hand. A user may read the output produced after the
full analysis, but when he finds that the system has
&amp;quot;obviously&amp;quot; gone wrong or failed to produce the
output, he can always switch to a simpler output.

3. Corpora and Lexical Resources
3.1 Corpora for Indian Languages
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999787444444445">
Text Corpora for 12 Indian languages has been
prepared with funding from Ministry of Information
Technology, Govt. of India. Each corpus is of about
3-million words, consisting of randomly chosen text-
pieces published from 1970 to 1980. The texts are
categorized into: literature (novel, short story),
science, social science, mass media etc. The corpus
can be used remotely over the net or obtained on CDs
(Corpora, URL).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999785">
3.2 Lexical Resources
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999938636363636">
A number of bilingual dictionaries among Indian
languages have been developed for the purpose of
machine translation, and are available &amp;quot;freely&amp;quot; under
GPL. Collaborative creation of a very large English to
Hindi lexical resource is underway. As a first step,
dictionary with 25000 entries with example sentences
illustrating each different sense of a word, has been
released on the web (Dictionary, URL). Currently
work is going on to refine it and to add contextual
information for use in the anusaaraka system, by
involving volunteers.

4. Linguistic Tools and Others
</sectionHeader>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.661642">
4.1. Morphological Analyzers
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.945082833333333">
Morphological analyzers for 6 Indian languages
developed as part of Anusaaraka systems are available
for download and use (Anusaaraka,URL). Sanskrit
morphological analyzers have been developed with
reasonable coverage based on the Paninian theory by
Ramanujan and Melkote.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.966479">
4.2 Parsers
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999922333333333">
Besides the parsers mentioned above, a parsing
formalism called UCSG identifies clause boundaries
without using sub-categorization information.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.992119">
4.3 others
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999845285714286">
Some work has also started on building search
engines. However, missing are the terminological
databases and thesauri. Spelling checkers are
available for many languages. There is substantial
work based on alternative theoretical models of
language analysis. Most of this work is based on
Paninian model (Bharati, 1995).
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.99872" genericHeader="method">
5. Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999988">
In conclusion, there is a large computational linguistic
activity in Indian languages, mainly centred around
machine translation and lexical resources. Most
recently, a number of new projects have been started
for Indian languages with Govt. funding, and are
getting off the ground.
