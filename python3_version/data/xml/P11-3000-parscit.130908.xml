<bodyText confidence="0.999648769230769">
Welcome to the ACL-HLT 2011 Student Session. This year, we have two separate submission types:
Research Papers and Thesis Proposals. We accepted 22 out of the 57 submissions received from a
wide variety of countries. Of the accepted submissions, 18 were Research Papers and 4 were Thesis
Proposals. Each accepted paper is to be presented as a poster during the ACL-HLT 2011 Poster Session
and assigned a mentor to provide specific feedback and guidance to our authors.
The overall quality of the submissions were high and we thank our Program Committee for their
excellent feedback and reviews. We also thank our Faculty Advisors, Miles Osborne and Thamar
Solorio, for their patience and guidance. We would also like to thank the entire ACL-HLT 2011
Organizing Committee, especially Dekang Lin, Brian Roark, Nate Bodenstab, Guodong Zhou, and
Priscilla Rasmussen. All presenters were offered conference registration and travel support, thanks
to generous support from the U.S. National Science Foundation (Award Number 1102435), the ACL
Walker Student Fund, Google, and the European Association of Computational Linguistics. Finally,
our highest gratitude goes to all the students who submitted to the Student Session. Thank you.
