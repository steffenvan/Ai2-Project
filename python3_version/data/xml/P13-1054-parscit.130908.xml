This paper discusses the construction of a parallel
treebank currently involving ten languages that
represent several different language families, in-
cluding non-Indo-European. The treebank is based
on the output of individual deep LFG (Lexical-
Functional Grammar) grammars that were deve-
loped independently at different sites but within
the overall framework of ParGram (the Parallel
Grammar project) (Butt et al., 1999a; Butt et al.,
2002). The aim of ParGram is to produce deep,
wide coverage grammars for a variety of lan-
guages. Deep grammars provide detailed syntactic
analysis, encode grammatical functions as well as

other grammatical features such as tense or aspect,
and are linguistically well-motivated. The Par-
Gram grammars are couched within the linguis-
tic framework of LFG (Bresnan, 2001; Dalrymple,
2001) and are constructed with a set of grammati-
cal features that have been commonly agreed upon
within the ParGram group. ParGram grammars are
implemented using XLE, an efficient, industrial-
strength grammar development platform that in-
cludes a parser, a generator and a transfer sys-
tem (Crouch et al., 2012). XLE has been devel-
oped in close collaboration with the ParGram
project. Over the years, ParGram has continu-
ously grown and includes grammars for Ara-
bic, Chinese, English, French, German, Georgian,
Hungarian, Indonesian, Irish, Japanese, Mala-
gasy, Murrinh-Patha, Norwegian, Polish, Spanish,
Tigrinya, Turkish, Urdu, Welsh and Wolof.
ParGram grammars produce output that has
been parallelized maximally across languages ac-
cording to a set of commonly agreed upon uni-
versal proto-type analyses and feature values. This
output forms the basis of the ParGramBank paral-
lel treebank discussed here. ParGramBank is con-
structed using an innovative alignment methodol-
ogy developed in the XPAR project (Dyvik et al.,
2009) in which grammar parallelism is presup-
posed to propagate alignment across different pro-
jections (section 6). This methodology has been
implemented with a drag-and-drop interface as
part of the LFG Parsebanker in the INESS infras-
tructure (Ros´en et al., 2012; Ros´en et al., 2009).
ParGramBank has been constructed in INESS and
is accessible in this infrastructure, which also of-
fers powerful search and visualization.
In recent years, parallel treebanking1 has gained
in importance within NLP. An obvious applica-
tion for parallel treebanking is machine transla-
tion, where treebank size is a deciding factor for
whether a particular treebank can support a par-
ticular kind of research project. When conduct-
ing in-depth linguistic studies of typological fea-
tures, other factors such as the number of in-
cluded languages, the number of covered phe-
nomena, and the depth of linguistic analysis be-
come more important. The treebanking effort re-
ported on in this paper supports work of the lat-
ter focus, including efforts at multilingual depen-
dency parsing (Naseem et al., 2012). We have

created a parallel treebank whose prototype in-
cludes ten typologically diverse languages and re-
flects a diverse set of phenomena. We thus present
a unique, multilayered parallel treebank that rep-
resents more languages than are currently avail-
able in other treebanks, and different types of lan-
guages as well. It contains deep linguistic knowl-
edge and allows for the parallel and simultane-
ous alignment of sentences at several levels. LFG’s
f(unctional)-structure encodes dependency struc-
tures as well as information that is equivalent to
Quasi-Logical Forms (van Genabith and Crouch,
1996). LFG’s c(onstituent)-structure provides in-
formation about constituency, hierarchical rela-
tions and part-of-speech. Currently, ParGramBank
includes structures for the following languages
(with the ISO 639-3 code and language fam-
ily): English (eng, Indo-European), Georgian (kat,
Kartvelian), German (deu, Indo-European), Hun-
garian (hun, Uralic), Indonesian (ind, Austrone-
sian), Norwegian (Bokm˚al) (nob, Indo-European),
Polish (pol, Indo-European), Turkish (tur, Altaic),
Urdu (urd, Indo-European) and Wolof (wol, Niger-
Congo). It is freely available for download under
the CC-BY 3.0 license via the INESS treebanking
environment and comes in two formats: a Prolog

There have been several efforts in parallel tree-
banking across theories and annotation schemes.
Kuhn and Jellinghaus (2006) take a mini-
mal approach towards multilingual parallel tree-
banking. They bootstrap phrasal alignments over
a sentence-aligned parallel corpus of English,
French, German and Spanish and report concrete
treebank annotation work on a sample of sen-
tences from the Europarl corpus. Their annotation

scheme is the “leanest” possible scheme in that it
consists solely of a bracketing for a sentence in
a language (where only those units that play the
role of a semantic argument or modifier in a larger
unit are bracketed) and a correspondence relation
of the constituents across languages.
Klyueva and Mare˘cek (2010) present a small
parallel treebank using data and tools from two
existing treebanks. They take a syntactically an-
notated gold standard text for one language and
run an automated annotation on the parallel text
for the other language. Manually annotated Rus-
sian data are taken from the SynTagRus treebank
(Nivre et al., 2008), while tools for parsing the cor-
responding text in Czech are taken from the Tec-
toMT framework (Popel and ˇZabokrtsk´y, 2010).
The SMULTRON project is concerned with con-
structing a parallel treebank of English, German
and Swedish. The sentences have been POS-tagged
and annotated with phrase structure trees. These
trees have been aligned on the sentence, phrase
and word level. Additionally, the German and
Swedish monolingual treebanks contain lemma in-
formation. The treebank is distributed in TIGER-
XML format (Volk et al., 2010).
Megyesi et al. (2010) discuss a parallel English-
Swedish-Turkish treebank. The sentences in each
language are annotated morphologically and syn-
tactically with automatic tools, aligned on the
sentence and the word level and partially hand-
corrected.3
A further parallel treebanking effort is Par-
TUT, a parallel treebank (Sanguinetti and Bosco,
2011; Bosco et al., 2012) which provides depen-
dency structures for Italian, English and French
and which can be converted to a CCG (Combina-
tory Categorial Grammar) format.
Closest to our work is the ParDeepBank, which
is engaged in the creation of a highly paral-
lel treebank of English, Portuguese and Bulgar-
ian. ParDeepBank is couched within the linguistic
framework of HPSG (Head-Driven Phrase Struc-
ture Grammar) and uses parallel automatic HPSG
grammars, employing the same tools and imple-
mentation strategies across languages (Flickinger
et al., 2012). The parallel treebank is aligned on
the sentence, phrase and word level.
In sum, parallel treebanks have so far fo-
cused exclusively on Indo-European languages

(with Turkish providing the one exception) and
generally do not extend beyond three or four
languages. In contrast, our ParGramBank tree-
bank currently includes ten typologically differ-
ent languages from six different language families
(Altaic, Austronesian, Indo-European, Kartvelian,
Niger-Congo, Uralic).
A further point of comparison with ParDeep-
Bank is that it relies on dynamic treebanks, which
means that structures are subject to change dur-
ing the further development of the resource gram-
mars. In ParDeepBank, additional machinery is
needed to ensure correct alignment on the phrase
and word level (Flickinger et al., 2012, p. 105).
ParGramBank contains finalized analyses, struc-
tures and features that were designed collabora-
tively over more than a decade, thus guaranteeing
a high degree of stable parallelism. However, with
the methodology developed within XPAR, align-
ments can easily be recomputed from f-structure
alignments in case of grammar or feature changes,
so that we also have the flexible capability of
allowing ParGramBank to include dynamic tree-
banks.

<bodyText confidence="0.99989796">
The ParGram grammars use the LFG formalism
which produces c(onstituent)-structures (trees)
and f(unctional)-structures as the syntactic anal-
ysis. LFG assumes a version of Chomsky’s Uni-
versal Grammar hypothesis, namely that all lan-
guages are structured by similar underlying prin-
ciples (Chomsky, 1988; Chomsky, 1995). Within
LFG, f-structures encode a language universal
level of syntactic analysis, allowing for crosslin-
guistic parallelism at this level of abstraction. In
contrast, c-structures encode language particular
differences in linear word order, surface morpho-
logical vs. syntactic structures, and constituency
(Dalrymple, 2001). Thus, while the Chomskyan
framework is derivational in nature, LFG departs
from this view by embracing a strictly representa-
tional approach to syntax.
ParGram tests the LFG formalism for its uni-
versality and coverage limitations to see how far
parallelism can be maintained across languages.
Where possible, analyses produced by the gram-
mars for similar constructions in each language are
parallel, with the computational advantage that the
grammars can be used in similar applications and
that machine translation can be simplified.

The ParGram project regulates the features and
values used in its grammars. Since its inception
in 1996, ParGram has included a “feature com-
mittee”, which collaboratively determines norms
for the use and definition of a common multilin-
gual feature and analysis space. Adherence to fea-
ture committee decisions is supported technically
by a routine that checks the grammars for com-
patibility with a feature declaration (King et al.,
2005); the feature space for each grammar is in-
cluded in ParGramBank. ParGram also conducts
regular meetings to discuss constructions, analy-
ses and features.
For example, Figure 1 shows the c-structure
of the Urdu sentence in (1) and the c-structure
of its English translation. Figure 2 shows the f-
structures for the same sentences. The left/upper
c- and f-structures show the parse from the En-
glish ParGram grammar, the right/lower ones from
Urdu ParGram grammar.4,5 The c-structures en-
code linear word order and constituency and thus
look very different; e.g., the English structure is
rather hierarchical while the Urdu structure is flat
(Urdu is a free word-order language with no evi-
dence for a VP; Butt (1995)). The f-structures, in
contrast, are parallel aside from grammar-specific
characteristics such as the absence of grammati-
cal gender marking in English and the absence of
articles in Urdu.6

With parallel analyses and parallel features, maxi-
mal parallelism across typologically different lan-
guages is maintained. As a result, during the con-
struction of the treebank, post-processing and con-
version efforts are kept to a minimum.

4The Urdu ParGram grammar makes use of a translitera-
tion scheme that abstracts away from the Arabic-based script;
the transliteration scheme is detailed in Malik et al. (2010).
5In the c-structures, dotted lines indicate distinct func-
tional domains; e.g., in Figure 1, the NP the farmer and the
VP sell his tractor belong to different f-structures: the former
maps onto the SUBJ f-structure, while the latter maps onto the
topmost f-structure (Dyvik et al., 2009). Section 6 elaborates
on functional domains.
6The CASE feature also varies: since English does not
distinguish between accusative, dative, and other oblique
cases, the OBJ is marked with a more general obl CASE.

We emphasize the fact that ParGramBank is
characterized by a maximally reliable, human-
controlled and linguistically deep parallelism
across aligned sentences. Generally, the result of
automatic sentence alignment procedures are par-
allel corpora where the corresponding sentences
normally have the same purported meaning as
intended by the translator, but they do not nec-
essarily match in terms of structural expression.
In building ParGramBank, conscious attention is
paid to maintaining semantic and constructional
parallelism as much as possible. This design fea-
ture renders our treebank reliable in cases when
the constructional parallelism is reduced even at f-
structure. For example, typological variation in the
presence or absence of finite passive constructions
represents a case of potential mismatch. Hungar-
ian, one of the treebank languages, has no produc-
tive finite passives. The most common strategy in
translation is to use an active construction with a
topicalized object, with no overt subject and with
3PL verb agreement:
</bodyText>

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.985541444444444">
the tree-ACC out-cut-PAST-3PL
‘The tree was cut down.’
In this case, a topicalized object in Hungarian has
to be aligned with a (topical) subject in English.
Given that both the sentence level and the phrase
level alignments are human-controlled in the tree-
bank (see sections 4 and 6), the greatest possible
parallelism is reliably captured even in such cases
of relative grammatical divergence.

For the initial seeding of the treebank, we focused
on 50 sentences which were constructed manu-
ally to cover a diverse range of phenomena (tran-
sitivity, voice alternations, interrogatives, embed-
ded clauses, copula constructions, control/raising
verbs, etc.). We followed Lehmann et al. (1996)
and Bender et al. (2011) in using coverage of
grammatical constructions as a key component for
grammar development. (3) lists the first 16 sen-
tences of the treebank. An expansion to 100 sen-
tences is scheduled for next year.

The sentences were translated from English
into the other treebank languages. Currently, these
languages are: English, Georgian, German, Hun-
garian, Indonesian, Norwegian (Bokm˚al), Polish,
Turkish, Urdu and Wolof. The translations were
done by ParGram grammar developers (i.e., expert
linguists and native speakers).
The sentences were automatically parsed with
ParGram grammars using XLE. Since the pars-
ing was performed sentence by sentence, our re-
sulting treebank is automatically aligned at the
sentence level. The resulting c- and f-structures
were banked in a database using the LFG Parse-
banker (Ros´en et al., 2009). The structures were
disambiguated either prior to banking using XLE
or during banking with the LFG Parsebanker and
its discriminant-based disambiguation technique.
The banked analyses can be exported and down-
loaded in a Prolog format using the LFG Parse-
banker interface. Within XLE, we automatically
convert the structures to a simple XML format and
make these available via ParGramBank as well.
The Prolog format is used with applications
which use XLE to manipulate the structures, e.g.
for further semantic processing (Crouch and King,
2006) or for sentence condensation (Crouch et al.,
2004).

5 Challenges for Parallelism
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999565">
We detail some challenges in maintaining paral-
lelism across typologically distinct languages.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.97034">
5.1 Complex Predicates
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999974217391304">
Some languages in ParGramBank make extensive
use of complex predicates. For example, Urdu uses
a combination of predicates to express concepts
that in languages like English are expressed with
a single verb, e.g., ‘memory do’ = ‘remember’,
‘fear come’ = ‘fear’. In addition, verb+verb com-
binations are used to express permissive or as-
pectual relations. The strategy within ParGram is
to abstract away from the particular surface mor-
phosyntactic expression and aim at parallelism
at the level of f-structure. That is, monoclausal
predications are analyzed via a simple f-structure
whether they consist of periphrastically formed
complex predicates (Urdu, Figure 3), a simple
verb (English, Figure 4), or a morphologically de-
rived form (Turkish, Figure 5).
In Urdu and in Turkish, the top-level PRED
is complex, indicating a composed predicate. In
Urdu, this reflects the noun-verb complex predi-
cate sTArT kar ‘start do’, in Turkish it reflects a
morphological causative. Despite this morphosyn-
tactic complexity, the overall dependency struc-
ture corresponds to that of the English simple verb.

The f-structure analysis of complex predicates
is thus similar to that of languages which do not
use complex predicates, resulting in a strong syn-
tactic parallelism at this level, even across typo-
logically diverse languages.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.977093">
5.2 Negation
</subsectionHeader>
<footnote confidence="0.5375724">
Negation also has varying morphosyntactic sur-
face realizations. The languages in ParGramBank
differ with respect to their negation strategies.
Languages such as English and German use inde-
pendent negation: they negate using words such as

adverbs (English not, German nicht) or verbs (En-
glish do-support). Other languages employ non-
independent, morphological negation techniques;
Turkish, for instance, uses an affix on the verb, as
in (6).

Within ParGram we have not abstracted away
from this surface difference. The English not in
(6) functions as an adverbial adjunct that modifies
the main verb (see top part of Figure 6) and infor-
mation would be lost if this were not represented
at f-structure. However, the same cannot be said of
the negative affix in Turkish — the morphological
affix is not an adverbial adjunct. We have there-
fore currently analyzed morphological negation as
adding a feature to the f-structure which marks the
clause as negative, see bottom half of Figure 6.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.991842">
5.3 Copula Constructions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99844935">
Another challenge to parallelism comes from co-
pula constructions. An approach advocating a uni-
form treatment of copulas crosslinguistically was
advocated in the early years of ParGram (Butt et
al., 1999b), but this analysis could not do justice to
the typological variation found with copulas. Par-
GramBank reflects the typological difference with
three different analyses, with each language mak-
ing a language-specific choice among the three
possibilities that have been identified (Dalrymple
et al., 2004; Nordlinger and Sadler, 2007; Attia,
2008; Sulger, 2011; Laczk´o, 2012).
The possible analyses are demonstrated here
with respect to the sentence The tractor is red.
The English grammar (Figure 7) uses a raising ap-
proach that reflects the earliest treatments of cop-
ulas in LFG (Bresnan, 1982). The copula takes
a non-finite complement whose subject is raised
to the matrix clause as a non-thematic subject of
the copula. In contrast, in Urdu (Figure 8), the

tion (English vs. Turkish)
copula is a two-place predicate, assigning SUBJ
and PREDLINK functions. The PREDLINK function
is interpreted as predicating something about the
subject. Finally, in languages like Indonesian (Fig-
ure 9), there is no overt copula and the adjective is
the main predicational element of the clause.

This section discussed some challenges for main-
taining parallel analyses across typologically di-
verse languages. Another challenge we face is
when no corresponding construction exists in a
language, e.g. with impersonals as in the English
It is raining. In this case, we provide a translation
and an analysis of the structure of the correspond-
ing translation, but note that the phenomenon be-
ing exemplified does not actually exist in the lan-
guage. A further extension to the capabilities of
the treebank could be the addition of pointers from
the alternative structure used in the translation to
the parallel aligned set of sentences that corre-
spond to this alternative structure.

6 Linguistically Motivated Alignment
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999879066666667">
The treebank is automatically aligned on the sen-
tence level, the top level of alignment within Par-
GramBank. For phrase-level alignments, we use
the drag-and-drop alignment tool in the LFG Parse-
banker (Dyvik et al., 2009). The tool allows the
alignment of f-structures by dragging the index
of a subsidiary source f-structure onto the index
of the corresponding target f-structure. Two f-
structures correspond if they have translationally
matching predicates, and the arguments of each
predicate correspond to an argument or adjunct in
the other f-structure. The tool automatically com-
putes the alignment of c-structure nodes on the
basis of the manually aligned corresponding f-
structures.7
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.61292725">
7Currently we have not measured inter-annotator agree-
ment (IAA) for the f-structure alignments. The f-structure
alignments were done by only one person per language pair.
We anticipate that multiple annotators will be needed for this
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.99996828125">
This method is possible because the c-structure
to f-structure correspondence (the 0 relation) is
encoded in the ParGramBank structures, allow-
ing the LFG Parsebanker tool to compute which c-
structure nodes contributed to a given f-structure
via the inverse (0−1) mapping. A set of nodes
mapping to the same f-structure is called a ‘func-
tional domain’. Within a source and a target
functional domain, two nodes are automatically
aligned only if they dominate corresponding word
forms. In Figure 10 the nodes in each func-
tional domain in the trees are connected by whole
lines while dotted lines connect different func-
tional domains. Within a functional domain, thick
whole lines connect the nodes that share align-
ment; for simplicity the alignment is only indi-
cated for the top nodes. The automatically com-
puted c-structural alignments are shown by the
curved lines. The alignment information is stored
as an additional layer and can be used to ex-
plore alignments at the string (word), phrase (c-
)structure, and functional (f-)structure levels.
We have so far aligned the treebank pairs
English-Urdu, English-German, English-Polish
and Norwegian-Georgian. As Figure 10 illustrates
for (7) in an English-Urdu pairing, the English ob-
ject neighbor is aligned with the Urdu indirect ob-
ject (OBJ-GO) hamsAyA ‘neighbor’, while the En-
glish indirect object (OBJ-TH) tractor is aligned
with the Urdu object TrEkTar ‘tractor’. The c-
structure correspondences were computed auto-
matically from the f-structure alignments.

The INESS platform additionally allows for the
highlighting of connected nodes via a mouse-over
technique. It thus provides a powerful and flexible
tool for the semi-automatic alignment and subse-
task in the future, in which case we will measure IAA for this
step.

7 Discussion and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.968379571428571">
We have discussed the construction of ParGram-
Bank, a parallel treebank for ten typologically
different languages. The analyses in ParGram-
Bank are the output of computational LFG Par-
Gram grammars. As a result of ParGram’s cen-
trally agreed upon feature sets and prototypical
analyses, the representations are not only deep
in nature, but maximally parallel. The representa-
tions offer information about dependency relations
as well as word order, constituency and part-of-
speech.
In future ParGramBank releases, we will pro-
vide more theory-neutral dependencies along with
the LFG representations. This will take the form of
triples (King et al., 2003). We also plan to provide
a POS-tagged and a named entity marked up ver-
sion of the sentences; these will be of use for more
general NLP applications and for systems which
use such markup as input to deeper processing.
8One reviewer inquires about possibilities of linking
(semi-)automatically between languages, for example using
lexical resources such as WordNets or Panlex. We agree that
this would be desirable, but unrealizable, since many of the
languages included in ParGramBank do not have a WordNet
resource and are not likely to achieve an adequate one soon.
Third, the treebank will be expanded to include
100 more sentences within the next year. We also
plan to include more languages as other ParGram
groups contribute structures to ParGramBank.
ParGramBank, including its multilingual sen-
tences and all annotations, is made freely avail-
able for research and commercial use under the
CC-BY 3.0 license via the INESS platform, which
supports alignment methodology developed in the
XPAR project and provides search and visualiza-
tion methods for parallel treebanks. We encourage
the computational linguistics community to con-
tribute further layers of annotation, including se-
mantic (Crouch and King, 2006), abstract knowl-
edge representational (Bobrow et al., 2007), Prop-
Bank (Palmer et al., 2005), or TimeBank (Mani
and Pustejovsky, 2004) annotations.

The is based on deep (Lexical- Functional Grammar) grammars that were developed within the framework of the ParGram (Parallel Grammar) effort.

An approach advocating a uniform treatment of copulas crosslinguistically was advocated in the early years of ParGram (Butt et al., 1999b), but this analysis could not do justice to the typological variation found with copulas. ParGramBank reflects the typological difference with three different analyses, with each language making a language-specific choice among the three possibilities that have been identified (Dalrymple et al., 2004; Nordlinger and Sadler, 2007; Attia, 2008; Sulger, 2011; Laczk´o, 2012). The possible analyses are demonstrated here with respect to the sentence The tractor is red. The English grammar (Figure 7) uses a raising approach that reflects the earliest treatments of copulas in LFG (Bresnan, 1982). The copula takes a non-finite complement whose subject is raised to the matrix clause as a non-thematic subject of the copula.

Additionally, the German and Swedish monolingual treebanks contain lemma information. The treebank is distributed in TIGERXML format (Volk et al., 2010). Megyesi et al. (2010) discuss a parallel EnglishSwedish-Turkish treebank. The sentences in each language are annotated morphologically and syntactically with automatic tools, aligned on the sentence and the word level and partially handcorrected.3 A further parallel treebanking effort is ParTUT, a parallel treebank (Sanguinetti and Bosco, 2011; Bosco et al., 2012) which provides dependency structures for Italian, English and French and which can be converted to a CCG (Combinatory Categorial Grammar) format. Closest to our work is the ParDeepBank, which is engaged in the creation of a highly parallel treebank of English, Portuguese and Bulgarian. ParDeepBank is couched within the linguistic framework of HPSG (Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar) and uses parallel automatic HPSG grammars, employing the same tools and implementation strategies across languages (Flickinger et al., 2012).

However, the same cannot be said of the negative affix in Turkish — the morphological affix is not an adverbial adjunct. We have therefore currently analyzed morphological negation as adding a feature to the f-structure which marks the clause as negative, see bottom half of Figure 6. 5.3 Copula Constructions Another challenge to parallelism comes from copula constructions. An approach advocating a uniform treatment of copulas crosslinguistically was advocated in the early years of ParGram (Butt et al., 1999b), but this analysis could not do justice to the typological variation found with copulas. ParGramBank reflects the typological difference with three different analyses, with each language making a language-specific choice among the three possibilities that have been identified (Dalrymple et al., 2004; Nordlinger and Sadler, 2007; Attia, 2008; Sulger, 2011; Laczk´o, 2012).

The left/upper c- and f-structures show the parse from the English ParGram grammar, the right/lower ones from Urdu ParGram grammar.4,5 The c-structures encode linear word order and constituency and thus look very different; e.g., the English structure is rather hierarchical while the Urdu structure is flat (Urdu is a free word-order language with no evidence for a VP; Butt (1995)).

The analyses in ParGramBank are the output of computational LFG ParGram grammars. As a result of ParGram’s centrally agreed upon feature sets and prototypical analyses, the representations are not only deep in nature, but maximally parallel. The representations offer information about dependency relations as well as word order, constituency and part-ofspeech. In future ParGramBank releases, we will provide more theory-neutral dependencies along with the LFG representations. This will take the form of triples (King et al., 2003). We also plan to provide a POS-tagged and a named entity marked up version of the sentences; these will be of use for more general NLP applications and for systems which use such markup as input to deeper processing. 8One reviewer inquires about possibilities of linking (semi-)automatically between languages, for example using lexical resources such as WordNets or Panlex. We agree that this would be desirable, but unrealizable, since many of the languages included in ParGramBank do not have a WordNet resource and are not likely to achieve an adequate one soon.

Since its inception in 1996, ParGram has included a “feature committee”, which collaboratively determines norms for the use and definition of a common multilingual feature and analysis space. Adherence to feature committee decisions is supported technically by a routine that checks the grammars for compatibility with a feature declaration (King et al., 2005); the feature space for each grammar is included in ParGramBank. ParGram also conducts regular meetings to discuss constructions, analyses and features. For example, Figure 1 shows the c-structure of the Urdu sentence in (1) and the c-structure of its English translation. Figure 2 shows the fstructures for the same sentences. The left/upper c- and f-structures show the parse from the English ParGram grammar, the right/lower ones from Urdu ParGram grammar.4,5 The c-structures encode linear word order and constituency and thus look very different; e.g., the English structure is rather hierarchic</context>

An obvious application for parallel treebanking is machine translation, where treebank size is a deciding factor for whether a particular treebank can support a particular kind of research project. When conducting in-depth linguistic studies of typological features, other factors such as the number of included languages, the number of covered phenomena, and the depth of linguistic analysis become more important. The treebanking effort reported on in this paper supports work of the latter focus, including efforts at multilingual dependency parsing (Naseem et al., 2012). We have 1Throughout this paper ‘treebank’ refers to both phrasestructure resources and their natural extensions to dependency and other deep annotation banks. created a parallel treebank whose prototype includes ten typologically diverse languages and reflects a diverse set of phenomena. We thus present a unique, multilayered parallel treebank that represents more languages than are currently available in other treebanks, and different types of languages as well. It contains deep linguistic knowledge and allows for the parallel and simultaneous alignment of sentences at several levels. LFG’s</context>

Klyueva and Mare˘cek (2010) present a small parallel treebank using data and tools from two existing treebanks. They take a syntactically annotated gold standard text for one language and run an automated annotation on the parallel text for the other language. Manually annotated Russian data are taken from the SynTagRus treebank (Nivre et al., 2008), while tools for parsing the corresponding text in Czech are taken from the TectoMT framework (Popel and ˇZabokrtsk´y, 2010). The SMULTRON project is concerned with constructing a parallel treebank of English, German and Swedish. The sentences have been POS-tagged and annotated with phrase structure trees. These trees have been aligned on the sentence, phrase and word level. Additionally, the German and Swedish monolingual treebanks contain lemma information.

An approach advocating a uniform treatment of copulas crosslinguistically was advocated in the early years of ParGram (Butt et al., 1999b), but this analysis could not do justice to the typological variation found with copulas. ParGramBank reflects the typological difference with three different analyses, with each language making a language-specific choice among the three possibilities that have been identified (Dalrymple et al., 2004; Nordlinger and Sadler, 2007; Attia, 2008; Sulger, 2011; Laczk´o, 2012). The possible analyses are demonstrated here with respect to the sentence The tractor is red. The English grammar (Figure 7) uses a raising approach that reflects the earliest treatments of copulas in LFG (Bresnan, 1982). The copula takes a non-finite complement whose subject is raised to the matrix clause as a non-thematic subject of the copula.
