This paper presents an algorithm
for extracting invertible proba-
bilistic translation grammars from
bilingual aligned and linguistically
bracketed text. The invertibility
condition requires all translation
ambiguities to be resolved in the fi-
nal translation grammar. The pa-
per examines the complexity of in-
ducing translation grammars and
proposes a number of heuristics to
reduce the the theoretically expo-

In the framework of corpus-based machine
translation, a number of methods have been
proposed for automatically inducing trans-
lation correspondences from aligned texts.
Some researcher parse alignments with the
aim of linking word translations and inter-
nal nodes of derivation trees in both lan-
guage sides of the alignment. (Wu, 1995),
for instance, proposes a bilingual stochas-
tic parser. This parser analyses both lan-
guage sides of an alignment in parallel where
the leaves of the binary derivation trees are
terminal symbols and all internal nodes are
non-terminals. (Watanabe et al., 2000) and
(Meyers et al., 1996; Meyers et al., 1998)
parse each language side independently and
try to find most likely node correspondences
in the derivation trees. Other approaches, in-
cluding this present one, try to induce a set
of context-free transfer rules from the align-
ments.
This paper proposes an algorithm which gen-
erates and filters a translation grammar (i.e.
a set of context-free transfer rules) from
aligned and bracketed pieces of text. The
transfer rules in this grammar are similar
to Takeda&apos;s &amp;quot;Translation Pattern&amp;quot; (Takeda,
1996; Watanabe and Takeda, 1998) with the
difference that art accepted input is necessar-
ily also translatable. Translation grammars
are made up of lexical transfer rules which
contain only terminal symbols and transla-
tion templates - i.e. generalized transfer rules
- which also contain variables.
In the framework of Example-Based Machine
Translation (EBMT), a number of methods
have been proposed for inducing translation
grammars from aligned texts. In so-called
&amp;quot;pure&amp;quot; EBMT systems, the only available
knowledge resource is the aligned text itself
(cf. (Block, 2000; Brown, 1997)), while in
richer systems additional, linguistic knowl-
edge resources are used to a varying degree;
cf. (Somers, 1999) for a review of EBMT-
systems and resources used by these systems.
According to (Somers, 1999), EBMT sys-
tems differ in the number and the quality
of resources used, the way this knowledge
is represented, stored and used for trans-

lation. EMIT systems differ also in the
way generalizations are computed. In al-
most all cases where generalizations are in-
duced from aligned texts, a set of two or more
alignments are compared and suitable sub-
sequences are replaced by variables. With re-
spect to this substitution one can distinguish
between methods which generalize similari-
ties (e.g. (Block, 2000; BostrOm, 1999) and
this present approach), methods which gen-
eralize differences (e.g. (Giivenir and Cicekli,
1998)) and methods which generalize both,
similarities and - as their complement - dif-
ferences (McTait and Trujillo, 1999). While
there is increasing research that aims at in-
ducing translation grammars from aligned
texts, a detailed analysis of the potentials
and implications of the different methods re-
mains to be undertaken in future.
The algorithm I shall present in this paper
expects as its input both language sides of
the alignments to be bracketed. We cur-
rently use the shallow parser KURD (Carl
and Schmidt-Wigger, 1998) for this bracket-
ing, although knowledge-poor methods could
similarly be used as, for instance, described
in (Zaanen, 2000). The algorithm generates
lexical transfer rules and generalizations from
the bracketed alignments and assigns prob-
abilities and weights to each of these rules.
From these rules, a translation grammar is
filtered. This grammar does not contain
translation ambiguities. Instead, each trans-
fer rule encodes a minimal context which
makes it unique in the translation grammar.
The algorithm does not require a bilingual
lexicon, but a lexicon can be provided to
bootstrap the system and enhance the out-
come. The translation grammar is expected
to re-generate the aligned text in a most com-
positional and complete manner. First, I de-
scribe how transfer rules are generated from
the bracketed alignments. Then I describe
how a set of invertible transfer rules is fil-
tered. Last I give art example of art induced
grammar.

2 Complexity of Inducing
Translation Templates

The program assumes a bilingual text P
which consists of n aligned pieces of text
an. Each alignment a, consists of a left-
hand side (111s) e and a right-hand side (rhs)
f. By means of a (shallow) parser, both lan-
guage sides e and f are independently brack-
eted (parsed) which results in a representa-
tion similar to the followingl:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.799462">
Ui : (a) b (c(d(e))) (((a1)11)cl) (e&apos;)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.997643465116279">
Without no further knowledge, one cannot
know which of the 111s-brackets translates
into which bracket in the rhs or whether a
111s-bracket has a rhs-translation at all. We
therefore assume that each 111s-bracket trans-
lates with the same probability into arty rhs-
bracket. For art alignment a, we can there-
fore extract p x q lexical transfer rules C, :
{c1. .cp,,,q}, where p is the number of llts-
brackets and q is the number of rhs-brackets.
The set C1 extracted from al is shown in fig-
ure 1.
In a second step, translation templates (or
generalizations) are induced from al and
the extracted lexical transfer rules c1 ...cp,,,q.
While a lexical transfer rule consists only of
1The letters &amp;quot;abcde&amp;quot; on the left-hand side repre-
sent lemmas of e; the letters &amp;quot;a&apos;b&apos; c&apos; e&amp;quot; those of f in
the right-hand side. The brackets are also annotated
with a phrasal tag and morpho-syntactic information.
For the sake of simplicity, I will not consider this in-
formation here.
terminal symbols, a generalization contains
variables (so-called reductions) in places
where a shorter transfer rule matches a sub-
sequence in the llts and in the rhs. A gen-
eralization has thus at least one reduction in
each language side and it has art equal num-
ber of reductions in the llts and the rhs. Each
reduction in llts is linked exactly to one re-
duction in rhs.
From the transfer rule c16, for instance, can
be generated 4 different generalizations while
from transfer rule cll only one generalization
can be generated. These are shown in fig-
ure 2. From the alignment al can be gen-
erated 25 generalizations by substituting one
or more transfer rules c1 c16.
More generally, from a transfer rule c3 which
has p bracketed sequences in its llts and q
bracketed sequences in its rhs, art exponen-
tial number of generalizations #G3 can be
generated:

<equation confidence="0.9999415">
#G3 = LdP i)
i=0 (q) +
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.99963847368421">
For instance, if we assume both, p and q to
be 10 and none of the 10 brackets in either
language side are included in another bracket
(i.e. all brackets are top-level brackets), more
than 180.000 different generalizations can be
generated. This is a number far too big to be
computed, as 10 brackets (i.e. constituents
in the parsed sentence) is not many. In fact,
50 or more brackets do appear frequently in
parsed sentences, although in the experiment
reported below, not all brackets are top-level.
Therefore, a number of heuristics is proposed
for generating from the set of possible gen-
eralizations only those achieving the highest
weight.
mar, each possible item in the translation
grammar, alignments a„ lexical transfer rules
c3 and generalizations gk, is linked to two
sets.

Each a, is associated with a set of lexical
transfer rules C, and a set of generalizations
G, which have been generated from a,. Each
lexical transfer rule c3 is associated with a set
A3 of alignments from which c3 has been ex-
tracted and a set of generalizations G3 which
have been generated from c3. Finally, each
generalization gk is associated with a set of
lexical transfer rules Ck which have been re-
placed in the generalization (i.e. the daugh-
ters of the generalization gk) and a set of ref-
erences Rk. Since generalizations are gener-
ated from alignments and from the extracted
lexical transfer rules, the set of references Rk
may consist of alignments a, and/or transfer
rules c3.

Based ort these probabilities, a weight is com-

The following properties of weights in trans-

transfer rule from which it was generated. A
generalization has a higher weight than the
daughters which have been substituted in the
generalization.

Moreover, generalizations have higher
weights if they contain i) more reductions or
ii) if the reductions are to the highest extend
compositional. We believe that these prop-
erties are suitable when using the induced
probabilistic grammar for translation. As
art example for achieving higher weights for
more compositional generalizations, consider
the following example.
As there are 16 lexical transfer rules ex-
tracted from alignment al and assuming that
n = 1, each of the rules has probability 1/4.
A sub-sequence in cll : (de) (a111) can be
substituted by rule c6 : (e) (al). This sub-
stitution yields generalization gi, as shown
in figure 2. It is assigned the weight 2/4 (cf.
equation 5). This weight is also assigned to
the transfer rule cll (cf. equation 4). Sub-
sequently, when generalizing the longer rule
c16 (cde) (aIbIcI), a set of four gener-
alizations C16 is generated from which g,5 is
assigned the highest weight due to the com-
positional nature of the replaced daughter

Evert the quadratic effort for generating the
sets C, for all alignments a, is too expensive
in a large aligned text. Therefore, alignments
a„ i = 1... n are generalized in a sequential
manner. For each a„ first the p x q lexical
transfer rules are extracted and sorted by the
length of the shorter string e or f. Transfer
rules c3 E C, are then generalized starting
with the shortest rule. The crucial points
in the procedure GenerateGrammar() are
lines 4 and 9. As was shown above, ex-
tracting the set of lexical transfer requires a
quadratic effort in the number of brackets,
while generating G3 from e3 is exponential.
To tackle this latter complexity, a version
of the A* algorithm considers only a limited
number of the highest weighted generaliza-
tion2.

The procedure to filter this grammar,

frequent top-most generalizations - i.e. those
generalizations of a, with the highest weight
- and recursively prints their daughters. Less
frequent rules, i.e. lower weighted rules, are
likely to to come along with more context.

6 Preliminary Experiments
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999952240740741">
The algorithm has been tested on a partially
parsed text with 4997 alignments. In this
first test both languages were identical, i.e.
the words and the structure of their brack-
etings was identical in the source and target
language. The aim of this experiment was to
see to what extend the algorithm produces
reasonable translation grammars for a pair
of structurally identical languages. A rea-
sonable assumption for translating a source
language into art identical target language is
that the induced transfer rules and general-
izations are identical in their llts and rhs, too.
The quality of the translation grammar can
then easily be measured by counting the rules
which differ in their llts and rhs.
The 4997 alignments had 45.352 words and
36.687 brackets on each language side. De-
pendent on the parameter setting - i.e. how
many brackets were maximally considered
per language side - the program took be-
tween 5 and 10 minutes ort a sun work station
to generate and filter the invertible gram-
mar. The filtered invertible grammar con-
tained 814 generalizations and 3692 lexical
translation rules and alignments. 3698 of the
filtered transfer rules had art identical llts and
rhs while 808 rules (18%) were different in
llts and rhs. Roughly half of these erroneous
rules were lexical transfer rules and half gen-
eralizations. Simulating a lexicon covering
10% of the aligned text reduced erroneous
transfer rules about 50% to 9,6% of the size
of the translation grammar. Augmenting the
lexicon to 20% reduced errors to 6,5% and
with 50% of the aligned text covered by a
lexicon produced 3.4% wrong output.
These results show that i) invertible gram-
mars can be induced in reasonable time and
ii) the proposed algorithm is scalable for the
integration of further knowledge resources -
such as a bilingual lexicon - which enhance
the quality of the induced grammar.
lit further experiments we will parse a text in
different ways to see how well the algorithm
can tackle different structures in both lan-
guage sides. The goal for the future is to de-
sign (partial) parsers for different languages
which yield similar brackets ort both language
sides in order to enable the algorithm to ex-
tract and filter reasonable translation gram-
mars more easily. The induced translation
grammars are supposed to be used in art
EMIT system.

Some researcher parse alignments with the aim of linking word translations and internal nodes of derivation trees in both language sides of the alignment. (Wu, 1995), for instance, proposes a bilingual stochastic parser. This parser analyses both language sides of an alignment in parallel where the leaves of the binary derivation trees are terminal symbols and all internal nodes are non-terminals. (Watanabe et al., 2000) and (Meyers et al., 1996; Meyers et al., 1998) parse each language side independently and try to find most likely node correspondences in the derivation trees. Other approaches, including this present one, try to induce a set of context-free transfer rules from the alignments. This paper proposes an algorithm which generates and filters a translation grammar (i.e. a set of context-free transfer rules) from aligned and bracketed pieces of text.

This constraint reflects that generally more or less the same number of (content) words appear in both sides of a translation. • By the same token, transfer rules and generalizations are weighted by the difference of number of words in e and f. This reflects the experience that translations are likely to contain approximately the same number of words in their source and target sides. 21n (Meyers et al., 1996) a similar mechanism is called &amp;quot;greedy heuristic&amp;quot;. • By means of a bilingual lexicon, transfer rules and generalizations are assigned (high) a-priori weights. • Only a limited number of highest weighted translation rules and generalizations is generated. • Each generalization can have up to a fixed maximum number of reductions.
