LETTER TO THE EDITOR
ON THE SEARCH FOR SEMANTIC PRIMITIVES
</note>
<bodyText confidence="0.995752126436782">
Dailey (1986) has transformed the classic problem of the
&amp;quot;vicious cycle or circle&amp;quot; into the neoclassical paradigm
of &amp;quot;NP-completeness&amp;quot;. As presented, there can be no
disagreement with his conclusion that the problem of
extracting a minimum set of semantic primitives from a
monolingual dictionary is NP-complete. However, I
believe (1) his use of NP-completeness is inappropriate
to the problem of finding semantic primitives in a
monolingual dictionary and (2) his notion of how a
primitive must emerge from an examination of defini-
tions is not sufficiently perceptive.
Some suggestions for dealing with NP-complete
problems include developing algorithms that are fast
enough for small problems, that deal with special cases,
or that exploit special features of a particular instance of
the problem. With a large dictionary, such as Webster&apos;s
Third New International Dictionary, it would seem that
we are at a size where NP-completeness comes into
play. Even here, it is possible to reduce the problem to
a manageable level without invoking any special proce-
dures, using only a correct formulation of the problem.
The definienda and definitions of a monolingual dic-
tionary can be mapped into a graph theoretic structure
with nodes corresponding to definienda (as Dailey
does), but with links going from a word occurring in a
definition to the word being defined (opposite to Dai-
ley&apos;s direction). The problem of finding semantic prim-
itives in this model is then equivalent to finding what is
called in digraph theory the point basis of a digraph, i.e.,
those nodes from which all others in the dictionary are
reachable. Using straightforward algorithms to do this,
the size of the problem can be reduced considerably. (In
Litkowski 1978 and 1980, I show how this approach
reduced an initial set of 20,000 verbs to 4,000 &amp;quot;more
primitive&amp;quot; verbs. Amsler (1980) similarly used many
heuristics in analyzing verb definitions in a monolingual
pocket dictionary.)
After applying such &amp;quot;gross&amp;quot; techniques for pruning,
the problem is more tractable and it is possible to take
advantage of special features of the problem at hand. In
particular, it is possible to develop many heuristics
which take into account many of the characteristics of a
dictionary as well as many semantic considerations.
These heuristics make it possible to reduce the problem
even further, moving ever closer to semantic primitives.
With all that has been said above, I do not want to
leave the impression that the problem is in any sense
easy. If that were the case, the literature would be
replete with claims based on analysis of dictionaries that
such and such constitute primitives. Such analysis is
filled with complexity and near overwhelming size, but it
is tractable, even though we may not be able to develop an
efficient algorithm to solve the problem once for all time.
In connection with the second point, about the nature
of the primitives discoverable from a monolingual dictio-
nary, I believe Dailey has fallen into a trap. As one
reduces the digraph of a monolingual dictionary, even
with all the heuristics, one is left with the conclusion that
vicious cycles will inevitably remain, except for minor
parts of speech, such as prepositions and conjunctions
which appear to have functional definitions that act as
primitives. The presence of a cycle as a primitive is
disconcerting; I believe Dailey sees that as proof that the
problem of finding semantic primitives is intractable.
I have argued (Litkowski 1978) that one will eventu-
ally reach the situation where all that remains (for the
significant parts of speech) is a set of vicious cycles,
agreeing in this respect with Dailey. However, I inter-
pret these cycles, not as unknowable, but rather as
individual concepts where each point in the cycle cor-
responds to the same concept and is merely labeled
differently. I believe that such concepts should ulti-
mately be describable in terms of some functions or
procedures (as Schank (1972) does with his primitives).
I ascribe the phenomenon present in monolingual dic-
tionaries to the imperfections of lexicographers and to
the as yet inscrutable nature of what functionality is
captured by such primitive concepts.
Thus, I argue that the search for primitives in a mono-
lingual dictionary is not an empty exercise. Rather, I
believe that it can indeed uncover primitives and, in the
process, help us to build better lexicons, to make them
more consistent, and to make it possible to build a
better set of frame constructs as elements for any
computational system that relies on natural language.
