<bodyText confidence="0.8814389375">
In this paper, we address the problem of min-
ing transliterations of Named Entities (NEs)
from large comparable corpora. We leverage
the empirical fact that multilingual news ar-
ticles with similar news content are rich in
Named Entity Transliteration Equivalents
(NETEs). Our mining algorithm, MINT, uses
a cross-language document similarity model to
align multilingual news articles and then
mines NETEs from the aligned articles using a
transliteration similarity model. We show that
our approach is highly effective on 6 different
comparable corpora between English and 4
languages from 3 different language families.
Furthermore, it performs substantially better
than a state-of-the-art competitor.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.9996585">
Named Entities (NEs) play a critical role in many
Natural Language Processing and Information
Retrieval (IR) tasks. In Cross-Language Infor-
mation Retrieval (CLIR) systems, they play an
even more important role as the accuracy of their
transliterations is shown to correlate highly with
the performance of the CLIR systems (Mandl
and Womser-Hacker, 2005, Xu and Weischedel,
2005). Traditional methods for transliterations
have not proven to be very effective in CLIR.
Machine Transliteration systems (AbdulJaleel
and Larkey, 2003; Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002;
Virga and Khudanpur, 2003) usually produce
incorrect transliterations and translation lexcions
such as hand-crafted or statistical dictionaries are
too static to have good coverage of NEs&apos; occur-
ring in the current news events. Hence, there is a
critical need for creating and continually updat-

guage every day. On an average, 260 and 452 new

ing multilingual Named Entity transliteration
lexicons.
The ubiquitous availability of comparable
news corpora in multiple languages suggests a
promising alternative to Machine Transliteration,
namely, the mining of Named Entity Translitera-
tion Equivalents (NETEs) from such corpora.
News stories are typically rich in NEs and there-
fore, comparable news corpora can be expected
to contain NETEs (Klementiev and Roth, 2006;
Tao et al., 2006). The large quantity and the per-
petual availability of news corpora in many of
the world’s languages, make mining of NETEs a
viable alternative to traditional approaches. It is
this opportunity that we address in our work.
In this paper, we detail an effective and scala-
ble mining method, called MINT (MIning
Named-entity Transliteration equivalents), for
mining of NETEs from large comparable corpo-
ra. MINT addresses several challenges in mining
NETEs from large comparable corpora: exhaus-
tiveness (in mining sparse NETEs), computa-
tional efficiency (in scaling on corpora size),
language independence (in being applicable to
many language pairs) and linguistic frugality (in
requiring minimal external linguistic resources).
Our contributions are as follows:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.981039352941176">
• We give empirical evidence for the hypo-
thesis that news articles in different languages
with reasonably similar content are rich sources
of NETEs (Udupa, et al., 2008).
• We demonstrate that the above insight can
be translated into an effective approach for min-
ing NETEs from large comparable corpora even
when similar articles are not known a priori.
• We demonstrate MINT’s effectiveness on
4 language pairs involving 5 languages (English,
Hindi, Kannada, Russian, and Tamil) from 3 dif-
ferent language families, and its scalability on
corpora of vastly different sizes (2,000 to
200,000 articles).
• We show that MINT’s performance is sig-
nificantly better than a state of the art method
(Klementiev and Roth, 2006).

2 Motivation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999837803921569">
MINT is based on the hypothesis that news ar-
ticles in different languages with similar content
contain highly overlapping set of NEs. News
articles are typically rich in NEs as news is about
events involving people, locations, organizations,
etc2. It is reasonable to expect that multilingual
news articles reporting the same news event
mention the same NEs in the respective languag-
es. For instance, consider the English and Hindi
news reports from the New York Times and the
BBC on the second oath taking of President Ba-
rack Obama (Figure 1). The articles are not pa-
rallel but discuss the same event. Naturally, they
mention the same NEs (such as Barack Obama,
John Roberts, White House) in the respective
languages, and hence, are rich sources of NETEs.
Our empirical investigation of comparable
corpora confirmed the above insight. A study of
2 News articles from the BBC corpus had, on an
average, 12.9 NEs and new articles from the The
New Indian Express, about 11.8 NEs.
200 pairs of similar news articles published by
The New Indian Express in 2007 in English and
Tamil showed that 87% of the single word NEs
in the English articles had at least one translitera-
tion equivalent in the conjugate Tamil articles.
The MINT method leverages this empirically
backed insight to mine NETEs from such compa-
rable corpora.
However, there are several challenges to the
mining process: firstly, vast majority of the NEs
in comparable corpora are very sparse; our anal-
ysis showed that 80% of the NEs in The New
Indian Express news corpora appear less than 5
times in the entire corpora. Hence, any mining
method that depends mainly on repeated occur-
rences of the NEs in the corpora is likely to miss
vast majority of the NETEs. Secondly, the min-
ing method must restrict the candidate NETEs
that need to be examined for match to a reasona-
bly small number, not only to minimize false
positives but also to be computationally efficient.
Thirdly, the use of linguistic tools and resources
must be kept to a minimum as resources are
available only in a handful of languages. Finally,
it is important to use as little language-specific
knowledge as possible in order to make the min-
ing method applicable across a vast majority of
languages of the world. The MINT method pro-
posed in this paper addresses all the above is-
sues.

as:
MINT has two stages. In the first stage, for
every document in the source language side, the
set of documents in the target language side with
similar news content are found using a cross-
language document similarity model. In the
second stage, the NEs in the source language
side are extracted using a Named Entity Recog-
nizer (NER) and, subsequently, for each NE in a
source language document, its transliterations are
mined from the corresponding target language
documents. We present the details of the two
stages of MINT in the remainder of this section.

<bodyText confidence="0.978380823529412">
The first stage of MINT method (Figure 2) works
on the documents from the comparable corpora
(CS, CT) in languages S and T and produces a col-
lection AS,T of similar article pairs (DS, DT). Each
article pair (DS, DT) in AS,T consists of an article
(DS) in language S and an article (DT) in language
T, that have similar content. The cross-language
similarity between DS and DT, as measured by the
cross-language similarity model MD, is at least a
&gt; 0.
Cross-language Document Similarity Model:
The cross-language document similarity model
measures the degree of similarity between a pair
of documents in source and target languages.
We use the negative KL-divergence between
source and target document probability distribu-
tions as the similarity measure.

The second stage of the MINT method works on
each pair of articles (DS, DT) in the collection AS,T
and produces a set PS,T of NETEs. Each pair (εS,
εT) in PS,T consists of an NE εS in language S, and
a token εT in language T, that are transliteration
equivalents of each other. Furthermore, the
transliteration similarity between εS and εT, as
measured by the transliteration similarity model
MT, is at least p &gt; 0. Figure 3 outlines this algo-

Generative Transliteration Similarity Model:
We also experimented with an extension of He’s
W-HMM model (He, 2007). The transition prob-
ability depends on both the jump width and the
previous source character as in the W-HMM
model. The emission probability depends on the
current source character and the previous target
character unlike the W-HMM model (Udupa et
al., 2009). Instead of using any single alignment
of characters in the pair (wS, wT), we marginalize
over all possible alignments:

4 Experimental Setup
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99984225">
Our empirical investigation consists of experi-
ments in three data environments, with each en-
vironment providing answer to specific set of
questions, as listed below:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.920604764705882">
1. Ideal Environment (IDEAL): Given a collec-
tion AS,T of oracle-aligned article pairs (DS, DT)
in S and T, how effective is Stage 2 of MINT in
mining NETE from AS,T?
2. Near Ideal Environment (NEAR-IDEAL):
Let AS,T be a collection of similar article pairs
(DS, DT) in S and T. Given comparable corpora
(CS, CT) consisting of only articles from AS,T, but
without the knowledge of pairings between the
articles,
a. How effective is Stage 1 of MINT in re-
covering AS,T from (CS, CT) ?
b. What is the effect of Stage 1 on the
overall effectiveness of MINT?
3. Real Environment (REAL): Given large
comparable corpora (CS, CT), how effective is
MINT, end-to-end?
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999993206896552">
The IDEAL environment is indeed ideal for
MINT since every article in the comparable cor-
pora is paired with exactly one similar article in
the other language and the pairing of articles in
the comparable corpora is known in advance.
We want to emphasize here that such corpora are
indeed available in many domains such as tech-
nical documents and interlinked multilingual
Wikipedia articles. In the IDEAL environment,
only Stage 2 of MINT is put to test, as article
alignments are given.
In the NEAR-IDEAL data environment, every
article in the comparable corpora is known to
have exactly one conjugate article in the other
language though the pairing itself is not known
in advance. In such a setting, MINT needs to
discover the article pairing before mining NETEs
and therefore, both stages of MINT are put to
test. The best performance possible in this envi-
ronment should ideally be the same as that of
IDEAL, and any degradation points to the short-
coming of the Stage 1 of MINT. These two en-
vironments quantify the stage-wise performance
of the MINT method.
Finally, in the data environment REAL, we
test MINT on large comparable corpora, where
even the existence of a conjugate article in the
target side for a given article in the source side of
the comparable corpora is not guaranteed, as in
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.99968625">
any normal large multilingual news corpora. In
this scenario both the stages of MINT are put to
test. This is the toughest, and perhaps the typical
setting in which MINT would be used.

three different language families (Hindi from the

common script and hence identification of cog-
nates, spelling variations, suffix transformations,
and other techniques commonly used for closely
related languages that have a common script are
not applicable for mining NETEs. Table 1 sum-

4.2 Cross-language Similarity Model
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999991607142857">
The cross-language document similarity model
requires a bilingual dictionary in the appropriate
language pair. Therefore, we generated statistical
dictionaries for 3 language pairs (from parallel
corpora of the following sizes: 11K sentence
pairs in English-Kannada, 54K in English-Hindi,
and 14K in English-Tamil) using the GIZA++
statistical alignment tool (Och et al., 2003), with
5 iterations each of IBM Model 1 and HMM.
We did not have access to an English-Russian
parallel corpus and hence could not generate a
dictionary for this language pair. Hence, the
NEAR-IDEAL experiments were not run for the
English-Russian language pair.
Although the coverage of the dictionaries was
low, this turned out to be not a serious issue for
our cross-language document similarity model as
it might have for topic based CLIR (Ballesteros
and Croft, 1998). Unlike CLIR, where the query
is typically smaller in length compared to the
documents, in our case we are dealing with news
articles of comparable size in both source and
target languages.
When many translations were available for a
source word, we considered only the top-4 trans-
lations. Further, we smoothed the document
probability distributions with collection frequen-
cy as described in (Ponte and Croft, 1998).

4.3 Transliteration Similarity Model
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999859809523809">
The transliteration similarity models for each of
the 4 language pairs were produced by learning
over a training corpus consisting of about 16,000
single word NETEs, in each pair of languages.
The training corpus in English-Hindi, English-
Kannada and English-Tamil were hand-crafted
by professionals, the English-Russian name pairs
were culled from Wikipedia interwiki links and
were cleaned heuristically. Equal number of
negative samples was used for training the mod-
els. To produce the negative samples, we paired
each source language NE with a random non-
matching target language NE. No language spe-
cific features were used and the same feature set
was used in each of the 4 language pairs making
MINT language neutral.
In all the experiments, our source side lan-
guage is English, and the Stanford Named Entity
Recognizer (Finkel et al, 2005) was used to ex-
tract NEs from the source side article. It should
be noted here that while the precision of the NER

corpus, perhaps due to the differences in the data
used for training the NER and the data on which
we used it.

4.4 Performance Measures
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999782">
Our intention is to measure the effectiveness of
MINT by comparing its performance with the
oracular (human annotator) performance. As
transliteration equivalents must exist in the
paired articles to be found by MINT, we focus
only on those NEs that actually have at least one
transliteration equivalent in the conjugate article.
Three performance measures are of interest to
us: the fraction of distinct NEs from source lan-
guage for which we found at least one translitera-
tion in the target side (Recall on distinct NEs),
the fraction of distinct NETEs (Recall on distinct
NETEs) and the Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)
of the NETEs mined. Since we are interested in
mining not only the highly frequent but also the
infrequent NETEs, recall metrics measure how
effective our method is in mining NETEs ex-
haustively. The MRR score indicates how effec-
tive our method is in preferring the correct ones
among candidates.
To measure the performance of MINT, we
created a test bed for each of the language pairs.
The test beds are summarized in Table 2.
The test beds consist of pairs of similar ar-
ticles in each of the language pairs. It should be
noted here that as transliteration equivalents must
exist in the paired articles to be found by MINT,
we focus only on those NEs that actually have at
least one transliteration equivalent in the conju-
gate article.

Note that in the first 3 language pairs MINT was
able to mine a transliteration equivalent for al-
most all the distinct NEs. The performance in
English-Russian pair was relatively worse, per-
haps due to the noisy training data.
In order to compare the effectiveness of
MINT with a state-of-the-art NETE mining ap-
proach, we implemented the time series based
Co-Ranking algorithm based on (Klementiev and

The second set of experiments investigated the
effectiveness of Stage 1 of MINT on comparable
corpora that are constituted by pairs of similar
articles, where the pairing information between
the articles is with-held. MINT reconstructed the
pairings using the cross-language document si-
milarity model and subsequently mined NETEs.
As in previous experiments, we ran our experi-
ments on test beds described in Section 4.4.
Results in the NEAR-IDEAL Environment:
There are two parts to this set of experiments. In
the first part, we investigated the effectiveness of
the cross-language document similarity model
described in Section 3.1. Since we know the
identity of the conjugate article for every article
in the test bed, and articles can be ranked accord-
ing to the cross-language document similarity
score, we simply computed the MRR for the
documents identified in each of the test beds,
considering only the top-2 results. Further, where
available, we made use of the publication date of
articles to restrict the number of target articles
that are considered in lines 4 and 5 of the MINT
algorithm in Figure 2. Table 5 shows the results
for two date windows – 3 days and 1 year.

<bodyText confidence="0.999950404761905">
CLIR systems have been studied in several
works (Ballesteros and Croft, 1998; Kraiij et al,
2003). The limited coverage of dictionaries has
been recognized as a problem in CLIR and MT
(Demner-Fushman &amp; Oard, 2002; Mandl &amp;
Womser-hacker, 2005; Xu &amp;Weischedel, 2005).
In order to address this problem, different
kinds of approaches have been taken, from learn-
ing transformation rules from dictionaries and
applying the rules to find cross-lingual spelling
variants (Pirkola et al., 2003), to learning trans-
lation lexicon from monolingual and/or compa-
rable corpora (Fung, 1995; Al-Onaizan and
Knight, 2002; Koehn and Knight, 2002; Rapp,
1996). While these works have focused on find-
ing translation equivalents of all class of words,
we focus specifically on transliteration equiva-
lents of NEs. (Munteanu and Marcu, 2006;
Quirk et al., 2007) addresses mining of parallel
sentences and fragments from nearly parallel
sentences. In contrast, our approach mines
NETEs from article pairs that may not even have
any parallel or nearly parallel sentences.
NETE discovery from comparable corpora
using time series and transliteration model was
proposed in (Klementiev and Roth, 2006), and
extended for NETE mining for several languages
in (Saravanan and Kumaran, 2007). However,
such methods miss vast majority of the NETEs
due to their dependency on frequency signatures.
In addition, (Klementiev and Roth, 2006) may
not scale for large corpora, as they examine
every word in the target side as a potential trans-
literation equivalent. NETE mining from compa-
rable corpora using phonetic mappings was pro-
posed in (Tao et al., 2006), but the need for lan-
guage specific knowledge restricts its applicabili-
ty across languages. We proposed the idea of
mining NETEs from multilingual articles with
similar content in (Udupa, et al., 2008). In this
work, we extend the approach and provide a de-
tailed description of the empirical studies.

7 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999987555555555">
In this paper, we showed that MINT, a simple
and intuitive technique employing cross-
language document similarity and transliteration
similarity models, is capable of mining NETEs
effectively from large comparable news corpora.
Our three stage empirical investigation showed
that MINT performed close to optimal on com-
parable corpora consisting of pairs of similar ar-
ticles when the pairings are known in advance.
MINT induced fairly good pairings and performs
exceedingly well even when the pairings are not
known in advance. Further, MINT outperformed
a state-of-the-art baseline and scaled to large
comparable corpora. Finally, we demonstrated
the language neutrality of MINT, by mining
NETEs from 4 language pairs (between English
and one of Russian, Hindi, Kannada or Tamil)
from 3 vastly different linguistic families.
As a future work, we plan to use the ex-
tended W-HMM model to get features for the
discriminative transliteration similarity model.
We also want to use a combination of the cross-
language document similarity score and the
transliteration similarity score for scoring the
NETEs. Finally, we would like to use the mined
NETEs to improve the performance of the first
stage of MINT.

We did not have access to an English-Russian parallel corpus and hence could not generate a dictionary for this language pair. Hence, the NEAR-IDEAL experiments were not run for the English-Russian language pair. Although the coverage of the dictionaries was low, this turned out to be not a serious issue for our cross-language document similarity model as it might have for topic based CLIR (Ballesteros and Croft, 1998). Unlike CLIR, where the query is typically smaller in length compared to the documents, in our case we are dealing with news articles of comparable size in both source and target languages. When many translations were available for a source word, we considered only the top-4 translations.

On an average, 260 and 452 new NEs appeared daily in the XIE and AFE segments of the LDC English Gigaword corpora respectively. ing multilingual Named Entity transliteration lexicons. The ubiquitous availability of comparable news corpora in multiple languages suggests a promising alternative to Machine Transliteration, namely, the mining of Named Entity Transliteration Equivalents (NETEs) from such corpora. News stories are typically rich in NEs and therefore, comparable news corpora can be expected to contain NETEs (Klementiev and Roth, 2006; Tao et al., 2006). The large quantity and the perpetual availability of news corpora in many of the world’s languages, make mining of NETEs a viable alternative to traditional approaches. It is this opportunity that we address in our work. In this paper, we detail an effective and scalable mining method, called MINT (MIning Named-entity Transliteration equivalents), for mining of NETEs from large comparable corpora. MINT addresses several challenges in mining NETEs from large comparable corpora: exhaustiveness (in mining sparse NETEs), computational efficiency (in scaling on corpora size), l</context>

We show that our approach is highly effective on 6 different comparable corpora between English and 4 languages from 3 different language families. Furthermore, it performs substantially better than a state-of-the-art competitor. 1 Introduction Named Entities (NEs) play a critical role in many Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval (IR) tasks. In Cross-Language Information Retrieval (CLIR) systems, they play an even more important role as the accuracy of their transliterations is shown to correlate highly with the performance of the CLIR systems (Mandl and Womser-Hacker, 2005, Xu and Weischedel, 2005). Traditional methods for transliterations have not proven to be very effective in CLIR. Machine Transliteration systems (AbdulJaleel and Larkey, 2003; Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002; Virga and Khudanpur, 2003) usually produce incorrect transliterations and translation lexcions such as hand-crafted or statistical dictionaries are too static to have good coverage of NEs&apos; occurring in the current news events.

Unlike CLIR, where the query is typically smaller in length compared to the documents, in our case we are dealing with news articles of comparable size in both source and target languages. When many translations were available for a source word, we considered only the top-4 translations. Further, we smoothed the document probability distributions with collection frequency as described in (Ponte and Croft, 1998). 4.3 Transliteration Similarity Model The transliteration similarity models for each of the 4 language pairs were produced by learning over a training corpus consisting of about 16,000 single word NETEs, in each pair of languages. The training corpus in English-Hindi, EnglishKannada and English-Tamil were hand-crafted by professionals, the English-Russian name pairs were culled from Wikipedia interwiki links and were cleaned heuristically.

The limited coverage of dictionaries has been recognized as a problem in CLIR and MT (Demner-Fushman &amp; Oard, 2002; Mandl &amp; Womser-hacker, 2005; Xu &amp;Weischedel, 2005). In order to address this problem, different kinds of approaches have been taken, from learning transformation rules from dictionaries and applying the rules to find cross-lingual spelling variants (Pirkola et al., 2003), to learning translation lexicon from monolingual and/or comparable corpora (Fung, 1995; Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002; Koehn and Knight, 2002; Rapp, 1996). While these works have focused on finding translation equivalents of all class of words, we focus specifically on transliteration equivalents of NEs. (Munteanu and Marcu, 2006; Quirk et al., 2007) addresses mining of parallel sentences and fragments from nearly parallel sentences. In contrast, our approach mines NETEs from article pairs that may not even have any parallel or nearly parallel sentences.

The ubiquitous availability of comparable news corpora in multiple languages suggests a promising alternative to Machine Transliteration, namely, the mining of Named Entity Transliteration Equivalents (NETEs) from such corpora. News stories are typically rich in NEs and therefore, comparable news corpora can be expected to contain NETEs (Klementiev and Roth, 2006; Tao et al., 2006). The large quantity and the perpetual availability of news corpora in many of the world’s languages, make mining of NETEs a viable alternative to traditional approaches. It is this opportunity that we address in our work. In this paper, we detail an effective and scalable mining method, called MINT (MIning Named-entity Transliteration equivalents), for mining of NETEs from large comparable corpora.

MINT addresses several challenges in mining NETEs from large comparable corpora: exhaustiveness (in mining sparse NETEs), computational efficiency (in scaling on corpora size), language independence (in being applicable to many language pairs) and linguistic frugality (in requiring minimal external linguistic resources). Our contributions are as follows: • We give empirical evidence for the hypothesis that news articles in different languages with reasonably similar content are rich sources of NETEs (Udupa, et al., 2008). • We demonstrate that the above insight can be translated into an effective approach for mining NETEs from large comparable corpora even when similar articles are not known a priori. • We demonstrate MINT’s effectiveness on 4 language pairs involving 5 languages (English, Hindi, Kannada, Russian, and Tamil) from 3 different language families, and its scalability on corpora of vastly different sizes (2,000 to 200,000 articles). • We show that MINT’s performance is significantly better than a state of the art method (Klementiev and Roth, 2006).

The transition probability depends on both the jump width and the previous source character as in the W-HMM model. The emission probability depends on the current source character and the previous target character unlike the W-HMM model (Udupa et al., 2009).
