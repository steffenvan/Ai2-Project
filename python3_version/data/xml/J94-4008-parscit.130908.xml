The publication of this (1990) doctoral dissertation, written at the University of Cler-
mont-Ferrand under Gabriel G. Bes, makes it possible to have in French a very useful
reference work for syntactic systems based on generalized phrase-structure grammars
(GPSGs) and unification categorial grammars (UCGs), as well as a good treatment of
French syntax. Not only is the text very precise in its description of the constructions
it deals with, but the detailed technical annexes (a quarter of the whole book) present
lexical entries, grammar rules, and execution traces that give the reader a concrete
idea of the actual implementation. The linguistic analysis, faithfully based on the data
given by Gross (1975) for control phenomena, also covers other aspects of syntax
(linear order, modifier/argument relations, etc.).
The very good introduction to the theoretical framework of GPSG is based on that
of Gazdar et al. (1985) and is followed by a detailed presentation of the way it was
adapted for the grammar of French.&apos; The introduction to UCG is based on that of
Calder et al. (1986) and is illustrated by its implementation in the FDP system, built at
Clermont-Ferrand, and by Baschung&apos;s own functional grammar (FG).2 The explanation
of the operations of composition and concatenation in UCG is so clear that it can serve as
a reference for the theoretical framework, and the comparison between the two UCGs
reveals those aspects that are due to linguistic choices rather than to the formalism
itself.
A thread running through the whole book, and especially emphasized in the sec-
tion on GPSG, is the argumentation against the minimal distance principle (PDM in
French) for determining the referent of the controller of an infinitive on a purely struc-
tural basis, with a criterion applied to the syntactic (or semantic) representation of the
sentence. Baschung&apos;s thesis is that, on the contrary, the determination of the controller
is based on a set of principles, some universal and some particular to the specific Ian-

&amp;quot;non-implemented formalism&amp;quot; in the conclusion (p. 293).

guage (here, French). These principles take into account both the (lexically specified)
argumental structure of the matrix verb and the syntactic realization of the arguments
(e.g., presence of a content preposition, interrogative structure, raising of an argument,
etc.). The starting hypothesis is &amp;quot;the possibility of an infinitive predicate capturing (as
subject) any argument available in the matrix clause&amp;quot; (p. 102).3
The chapter introducing control phenomena highlights the fundamentally rela-
tional nature of infinitive constructions, which contrast in this respect with finite com-
plement clauses, and underlines the internal aspect of the reconstruction of the referent
of their subject. Baschung also introduces here a crucial distinction between obligatory
control (PCO principles) and nonobligatory control (PC principles), obligatory control
being a particular case of nonobligatory control. The latter is similar to pronominal
and anaphoric resolution and remains distinct from arbitrary control (treated as non-
obligatory in government-binding (GB) and lexical functional grammar (LEG)).&apos;
The author makes a large number of very sharp and pertinent observations—e.g.,
about prepositional phrases, the fact that the possibility of the noun phrase&apos;s being a
controller is conditioned by the nature of the preposition (p. 51); about the semantics of
&amp;quot;general condition&amp;quot; predicates such as il est vrail faux, il faut (&apos;it is true/false/necessary&apos;),
that omitting the controller imposes an arbitrary interpretation (p. 89); and the fact that,
structurally, a preposition and an interrogative phrase have the same functional value
with respect to control (p. 67). However, the general rules are not always convincing;
in particular, concerning expletives, the restriction PC2a (p. 38: &amp;quot;An expletive NP (i.e.,
ce) or an NP which is necessarily [-HUMAN] is a forbidden controller&amp;quot;) cannot be
accepted in the face of examples such as Il semble se mettre h neiger (&apos;It seems to have
started to snow&apos;).
Concerning details of the analysis, the claim (p. 60) that Bach&apos;s generalization does
not hold in French may be premature. Indeed, if Example (107) is not acceptable in
English, neither is its translation into French.
(107) *Mary persuaded to come. (*Mary a persuade de venir)
Thus, there is indeed a difference with verbs such as ordonner, which accept a phonet-
ically null controller for their infinitive complement. However, Bach&apos;s generalization
also has exceptions in English; see Keyser and Roeper (1984) for examples of con-
trollers that are not present at surface structure (e.g., The boat was sunk to collect the
insurance).
On the other hand, as the correlations observed by Seelbach (1978) do not obtain
in a manner regular enough to allow deduction of rules from them, it does seem
more appropriate to follow the approach advocated by Baschung and to base the
correlation between the position of the noun phrase controlling the infinitive and the
mood of the complement upon the pragmatic interpretation of the use of the infinitive
as information-providing and of the subjunctive as order-giving.
I will not spend too much time on the presentation of GPSG nor on the grammar
that is proposed for it. It is, however, worth noting that the section on infinitive com-
plements highlights some of the unsolved problems in GPSG concerning adjectival
constructions of the type easy to please. In addition, the implementation in the GPSG of
the principles proposed in the beginning of the book, in particular that of PCO2 (&amp;quot;The
controller of an infinitive may be any argument which is not explicitly forbidden.
The prohibition is lexically specified on the predicate of the matrix clause&amp;quot;), shows

clearly the limitations imposed by the fact that in this framework the only syntactic
information available at the level of the lexical entries is the subcategorization number.
One of the general principles of this model is that of functional realization: the
form of the semantic rules is automatically determined from the semantic type of the
syntactic constituents. In this French GPSG, two operators for semantic combination
introduce the schemata for the semantics of Raising and Equi predicates. These predi-
cates are treated through the use of meaning postulates, and the grammatical hierarchy
is preserved in the semantic type. (This is motivated by the extension of the treatment
of control to subject infinitives.) The two combinatory operators also allow Baschung
to account for the control of object-raising adjectives and of (infinitive) indirect ques-
tions. The grammar can also treat instances of multiple control, which poses problems
not only for building the semantic interpretation, but for syntactic agreement.
In UCG, building the semantic representation is one particular aspect of the general
process of functional application. The grammar specifies which argument slot on the
argument list is to be filled through the active sign of the categorial list of the functor.
Infinitives are not represented as properties, but as open propositions whose subject
argument is saturated by the controlling noun phrase.&apos;
UCG does not permit an easy distinction between verb phrase modifier and sen-
tential modifier because the indices for verb phrase and subject are the same in simple
sentences. This is one of the motivations for the treatment of infinitives that Baschung
proposes, and indeed the most important point about the FDP grammar is that an
infinitive is treated as a verb phrase whereas its subject remains syntactically accessi-
ble, since in categorial grammar a verb phrase is necessarily of category s/np. UCG
can account directly for PC01 (&amp;quot;An infinitive must be controlled in its matrix clause&amp;quot;)
because the mechanism is based on the unification of variables, thus enforcing the
strict locality of obligatory control.&apos; The distinction between a nonexistent and an un-
known argument, which is introduced at the start of the book and which accounts for
the ambiguity of some predicates between their two-place and three-place readings,
is elegantly put to use in UCG to treat arbitrary control when the unknown argument
is optional.
FG is an &amp;quot;alternative UCG grammar&amp;quot; for French that is largely based on FDP
but presents a number of differences, most importantly concerning the treatment of
valency in lexical entries and that of the linear order of syntactic constituents. The
differences between FDP and FG concerning the treatment of infinitives are mainly
theoretical, but have some implications for the implementation. In FDP, verbs are
arguments with respect to noun phrases and functors with respect to infinitives. In
FG, on the other hand, infinitives as well as noun phrases are type-raised categories,
i.e., functors with respect to verbs. Thus in FG, the lexical entry of every verb turns it
into a functor and embedded infinitives are treated as regular noun phrases. However,
their valency list is not empty, and the subject of the infinitive remains accessible from
the lexical entry of the matrix verb. An interesting generalization (p. 67) is that, since
embedding (not merely of infinitives) is systematically correlated with type raising, the
latter can be seen as a kind of nominalization operator in the grammar. Combinatory
rules are also defined differently in FG: the features of the resulting sign are determined
partly from the features of the active sign of the functor and partly from the features
of the argument.

<footnote confidence="0.875677">
5 In fact it would not be possible to build a propositional function in FDP, because no argument selector
is available.
6 The nonobligatory control principles (PC2a and PC2b) and the obligatory control principles (PCO2a,
PCO2c, and PCO2d) are expressed in FDP only by means of the lexical entries, and not explicitly.

The main concept in FG is that the French linguistic data require that valency be
treated not as an ordered list, but as a set. This ties in with another observation, that
information leading to concatenation in the grammar is never linked to information
concerning linear ordering. Unfortunately, the whole section about erasing in non-
adjacency phenomena and about constraint checking in the FG erasing &amp;quot;rule&amp;quot; is rather
obscure and deserves clarification. However, it seems to be only a mechanism whose
details have no direct relevance except for a Prolog implementation of this particular
approach. On the other hand, the remark (p. 258) that erasing should not be treated
as a rule, since that would be equivalent to the hidden creation of lexical entries, but
rather as a filter to check the well-formedness of signs, deserves further study.
The issue of accessing features independently of the categorial list constitutes one
of the motivations for the differences between the FDP grammar—where it is not pos-
sible, which leads to false lexical ambiguities—and FG—where it is systematic. FDP
and FG also diverge in their treatment of lexical ambiguity: whereas FDP (thereby fol-
lowing GPSG) gives several lexical entries for different subcategorization lists with the
same semantics, FG gives different lexical entries for the same word only if different
features or different subcategorization lists give rise to different semantic interpreta-
tions. In fact, having only one lexical entry for each word is a fundamental principle
of FG. Thus the grammar must contain some way of expressing the relations between
different valencies. This is the MBU procedure, which is the specification of the result
of the unification operation over sets (the valencies) for given items (the functor and
the argument) and which plays a crucial role in the determination of control in the
grammar. Since the unification operation over sets is not defined in Prolog, this pro-
cedure gives a definition for it that allows the expression of the linguistic phenomena
to be accounted for. However, this specification cannot be taken as a general principle,
a fact that the conclusion of the book underlines. Indeed the hope is expressed that
an extension of FG will make it possible to define MBU operations that belong to
universal grammar and to distinguish them from MBU operations that are language
specific. Nevertheless, the choice of the maximally lexicalist hypothesis (i.e., that of
specifying the necessary information in each lexical entry rather than through lexi-
cal rules) might result in a more fine-grained description, but as Baschung notes, it
also excludes the possibility of stating generalizations in the lexicon, and this can be
challenged on methodological grounds.
To conclude, this book not only provides an excellent overview of the UCG frame-
work, but will also prove very useful to researchers working on the treatment of
French. The lack of an index is thus to be regretted, since the rather difficult and de-
tailed material being treated requires frequent backtracking. As for the few negative
remarks I have to make, I would deplore the number of typographical mistakes. Some
are not very damaging (e.g., Cherchia instead of Chierchia in the bibliography, or ex-
ample (284), which does not correspond lexically to its extension in (285)), but some
impede comprehension of the text. For instance, example (226.b), Il est triste de partir
is sad to leave&apos;) with impersonal i/ is given as unacceptable on p. 86, which must be a
typo, since in Annex 2, the adjective triste correctly allows this construction, as do the
GPSG rules (85) and (86) on p. 128. The lack of a translation for some quotations may
be a problem, if not for those in English, at least for those in German. Moreover, some
ambiguities in the terminology could easily have been clarified (e.g., &amp;quot;raised object&amp;quot;
in PCO2d refers to the original position of the argument, not to its landing site).

Bes, makes it possible to have in French a very useful reference work for syntactic systems based on generalized phrase-structure grammars (GPSGs) and unification categorial grammars (UCGs), as well as a good treatment of French syntax. Not only is the text very precise in its description of the constructions it deals with, but the detailed technical annexes (a quarter of the whole book) present lexical entries, grammar rules, and execution traces that give the reader a concrete idea of the actual implementation. The linguistic analysis, faithfully based on the data given by Gross (1975) for control phenomena, also covers other aspects of syntax (linear order, modifier/argument relations, etc.). The very good introduction to the theoretical framework of GPSG is based on that of Gazdar et al. (1985) and is followed by a detailed presentation of the way it was adapted for the grammar of French.&apos; The introduction to UCG is based on that of Calder et al. (1986) and is illustrated by its implementation in the FDP system, built at Clermont-Ferrand, and by Baschung&apos;s own functional grammar (FG).2 The explanation of the operations of composition and concatenation in UCG is so clear t</context>
