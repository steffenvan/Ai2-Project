Eileen Way has written a far-ranging and often fascinating book that argues for the
importance of metaphor for theories of knowledge representation and presents her
new theory of metaphor, called the Dynamic Type Hierarchy (DTH).

1. Outline of the Book
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9980311">
Chapter 1 provides Way&apos;s perspective on language and lays the basis for the rest of the
book. The first part of Chapter 2 reviews the major philosophical theories of metaphor.
Included in this review is the Interactionist approach pioneered by Richards (1936) and
later refined by Max Black (1962). This approach forms the basis for Way&apos;s theory.
The latter part of this chapter gives an excellent review of the current psycholinguistic
evidence on metaphor.
Chapter 3 surveys a number of AT knowledge representation issues and contro-
versies. Among the many issues touched upon are nonmonotonic logic, the frame
problem, neats versus scruffies, semantic nets versus first-order logic, the debate over
primitives, and declarative versus procedural representations. In the book&apos;s preface,
Way indicates that this chapter is intended to be a tutorial for those unfamiliar with AT
representation issues. Unfortunately, the unfocused nature of this chapter will probably
leave those readers ill-equipped for the specific issues that arise later in the book. The
topic of knowledge representation continues in Chapter 4 with a discussion of John
Sowa&apos;s theory of Conceptual Graphs (Sowa 1984). Way adopts Conceptual Graphs as
the representation system for her theory of metaphor. Disconcertingly, Way cites at
least three different works by Sowa without including them in the references.
Chapter 5 introduces Way&apos;s theory of the Dynamic Type Hierarchy. The basis for
this theory is a type hierarchy with multiple inheritance. Metaphor is viewed as a way
to highlight and change the structure of the hierarchy. The fundamental idea is that
interpreting a metaphor involves an upward search through the hierarchy for a com-
mon ancestor of the tenor and vehicle of the metaphor. This search is followed by the
creation of a new concept more specialized than the common ancestor, which is made
the immediate parent of the tenor and vehicle concepts. Notably, these mechanisms
are quite similar to those used by Fass to implement his theory of Collative Semantics
in the Meta5 system (Fass 1988) and the learning mechanisms in the MIDAS system
(Martin 1990).
Chapter 6, entitled &amp;quot;Computational Theories of Metaphor,&amp;quot; reviews a number of
more modern theories of metaphor and compares them to the DTH approach. The
theories presented here are mostly from the field of cognitive science, and are more

formal than those discussed in Chapter 2. Unfortunately, Way fails to discuss any
implemented systems designed to interpret or generate metaphor, such as Russell
(1976), Wilks (1978), Weiner (1984), Jacobs (1985), Fass (1988, 1991), and Martin (1990).
Chapter 7 presents a discussion of the logical foundations of inheritance hier-
archies. Chapter 8 is a broad discussion relating the DTH theory to issues such as
prototype theory and Wittgenstein&apos;s notions of family resemblance.
The final chapter, entitled &amp;quot;Programming the Dynamic Type Hierarchy,&amp;quot; promises
to fill in the implementation details missing from Chapter 5. It begins with a detailed
description of the CGEN system, a semantic interpreter based on Sowa&apos;s theories
implemented at IBM. This system does not implement the DTH theory and it is never
made clear why the details presented here are important to the DTH theory. The
remainder of the chapter illustrates how the DTH would behave by running through
several illustrative examples. Unfortunately, the lack of an implementation severely
limits the effectiveness of this discussion.

While this book succeeds in presenting a fresh perspective on some traditional lan-
guage problems, it fails to make the computational case for the new DTH theory.
Much of the book suffers from a lack of clear focus, resulting in too much philosophy
and too little implementation and experimentation. As a consequence, the description
of the Dynamic Type Hierarchy, while intriguing, is too impoverished to be anything
more than suggestive to those interested in actually implementing these ideas.
