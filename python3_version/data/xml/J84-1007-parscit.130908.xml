Minutes of the 1983 ACL Meeting
</title>
<bodyText confidence="0.9983562">
Following are the minutes of the 21st Annual Business
Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguis-
tics, held 16 June 1983 at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology in Cambridge, Massachusetts, with Ray
Perrault, President, presiding.

Program Committee Report

<bodyText confidence="0.999537117647059">
Mitch Marcus, Chair, reported for the Program Com-
mittee (which consisted of himself, Phil Cohen, Lauri
Karrtunen, Bill Mann, Bob Moore, Ann Robinson, and
Bob Wilensky.) Twenty-five of the sixty-seven papers
submitted were accepted for presentation. However,
for two of those papers the authors were asked to
present tutorials: David Israel gave one on situation
semantics, and Mark Liberman did one on speech
analysis. As another experiment, Ray Perrault organ-
ized a panel discussion on computational complexity
around a session of submitted papers, and prepared a
tutorial to introduce them. [The program is printed in
the January-March 1983 issue of the AJCL, Volume 9,
Number 1, pages 36-37. Copies of the Proceedings
($15; add $3 for US first class mailing and $6 for
overseas air printed delivery) can be ordered from the
Secretary-Treasurer.]

Don Walker reported for Jon Allen and Judy Sobel,
the Local Arrangements team. There were 148 people
preregistered and 73 registrants at the meeting, for a
total of 221 in attendance. The demonstrations and
the wine, cheese, and fruit reception were quite suc-
cessful. He reminded people that a banquet at the
Hyatt Regency, which will feature Ray Perrault&apos;s pres-
idential address, was scheduled for later that evening.

Don Walker noted that the minutes of the 1982 meet-
ing were printed in the July-December 1982 issue of
the American Journal of Computational Linguistics,
Volume 8, Number 3-4, pages 150-152.
He reviewed the financial status of the ACL for
1982 and the period of 1983 through June 5. The
income figures for the two periods were $58,772 and
$61,355, respectively; the corresponding expenses,
$40,503 and $45,079; the balances, $18,269 and
$16,275; and the assets, $56,206 and $72,481. The
success of the Conference on Applied Natural Lan-
guage, which was held in Santa Monica in February,
and the continuing distribution of surpluses from the
National Computer Conferences by AFIPS contribute
to the good financial picture. However, he noted that
no expenses for the 1983 AJCL volume have yet been
incurred. (A detailed report follows these Minutes.)
Walker presented the latest membership figures;
personal memberships continue to rise, increasing 25
percent between 1981 and 1982. The low figures for
1983 reflect the slowness of response to dues state-
ments. (The membership figures are appended to
these Minutes.)

James Allen reported that the last issue for 1982
would be in the mail immediately after the conference.
He stated that the journal could be substantially
caught up by the end of the next summer. Although
there is a modest backlog of papers in progress, he
encouraged people to submit manuscripts, promising a
six to eight week turnaround for feedback. Ray Per-
rault noted that the Executive Committee had re-
viewed the report submitted by Graeme Hirst and
Michael McCord and approved changing the name of
the journal to Computational Linguistics, beginning
with the 1984 volume, to reflect more accurately the
increasing internationalization of the Association.

Aravind Joshi announced that the new series being
published jointly by the ACL and Cambridge Universi-
ty Press had accepted three manuscripts, one of which
was already in production; four others are under re-
view. Natural Language Processing — Psychological,
Computational, and Theoretical Perspectives, a collec-
tion of papers edited by David Dowty, Lauri Karttu-
nen, and Arnold Zwicky, should be ready in the
Spring. Generating Natural Language, by Kathleen
McKeown, and Planning Natural Language Utterances,
by Douglas Appelt, will appear later in 1984. There
will be discounts for ACL members; procedures are
still to be worked out.

Martin Kay, the organizer for the 10th International
Conference an Computational Linguistics, announced
that plans were well under way for convening it at
Stanford from 2-6 July 1984. It will be a four-day
meeting, with the 4th of July as an excursion day in
the middle. The conference will be preceded by a
series of week-long short courses on a variety of top-
ics. COLING84 will also constitute the 22nd Annual
Meeting of the ACL. Kay projected an attendance of
400. Yorick Wilks is chairing the program committee.

Walker reported on the remarkably successful Confer-

February in Santa Monica, California, with support by
the Office of Naval Research. The final registration
figures showed 246 in attendance; 116 took part in the
four tutorials offered. An extensive Exhibits and
Demonstrations program also proved popular. [The
Program for the conference was listed in ACJL, Vol-

Martha Evens reported that she had been asked to
chair a Long Term Planning Committee formed to
review the organization of the ACL annual meetings.
The Executive Committee set it up in response to an
analysis and a set of recommendations prepared by
Bill Mann. Other members of the committee, in addi-
tion to Evens and Mann, are Martin Kay, Mitch Mar-
cus, Ray Perrault, and Don Walker.

Mike Rosner, Treasurer for the ACL European Chap-

Italy, 1-2 September 1983. The Program Committee,
which was chaired by Giacomo Ferrari and included
Joost Breuker, Gerald Gazdar, Margaret King, Win-
fred Lenders, Petr Sgall, and Antonio Zampolli, ac-
cepted 32 of the 64 papers submitted. A Proceedings
will be produced and distributed through the ACL
Office. Rosner remarked that there were now 316
European members, an increase of 120 over the previ-
ous year. With Wilks in Australia and Costa Rica for
sabbatical, Benny Brodda has replaced him on the
Chapter Advisory Committee. [The Program for the
