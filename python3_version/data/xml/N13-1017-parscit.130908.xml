<bodyText confidence="0.99948476">
Multi-dimensional latent text models, such as
factorial LDA (f-LDA), capture multiple fac-
tors of corpora, creating structured output for
researchers to better understand the contents
of a corpus. We consider such models for
clinical research of new recreational drugs and
trends, an important application for mining
current information for healthcare workers.
We use a “three-dimensional” f-LDA variant
to jointly model combinations of drug (mari-
juana, salvia, etc.), aspect (effects, chemistry,
etc.) and route of administration (smoking,
oral, etc.) Since a purely unsupervised topic
model is unlikely to discover these specific
factors of interest, we develop a novel method
of incorporating prior knowledge by leverag-
ing user generated tags as priors in our model.
We demonstrate that this model can be used
as an exploratory tool for learning about these
drugs from the Web by applying it to the task
of extractive summarization. In addition to
providing useful output for this important pub-
lic health task, our prior-enriched model pro-
vides a framework for the application of f-
LDA to other tasks.

<bodyText confidence="0.999977543478261">
Topic models aid exploration of the main thematic
elements of large text corpora by revealing latent
structure and producing a high level semantic view
(Blei et al., 2003). Topic models have been used for
understanding the contents of a corpus and identify-
ing interesting aspects of a collection for more in-
depth analysis (Talley et al., 2011; Mimno, 2011).
While standard topic models assume a flat seman-
tic structure, there are potentially many dimen-
sions of a corpus that contribute to word choice,
such as sentiment, perspective and ideology (Mei et
al., 2007; Paul and Girju, 2010; Eisenstein et al.,
2011). Rather than studying these factors in isola-
tion, multi-dimensional topic models can consider
multiple factors jointly.
Paul and Dredze (2012b) introduced factorial
LDA (f-LDA), a general framework for multi-
dimensional text models that capture an arbitrary
number of factors (explained in §3). While a stan-
dard topic model learns distributions over “topics”
in documents, f-LDA learns distributions over com-
binations of multiple factors (e.g. topic, perspec-
tive) called tuples (e.g. (HEALTHCARE,LIBERAL)).
While f-LDA can model factors without supervision,
it has not been used in situations where the user has
prior information about the factors.
In this paper we consider a setting where the user
has prior knowledge about the end application: min-
ing recreational drug trends from user forums, an
important clinical research problem (§2). We show
how to incorporate available information from these
forums into f-LDA as a novel hierarchical prior over
the model parameters, guiding the model toward the
desired output (§3.1).
We then demonstrate the model’s utility in ex-
ploring a corpus in a targeted manner by using it
to automatically extract interesting sentences from
the text, a simple form of extractive multi-document
summarization (Goldstein et al., 2000). In the
same way that topic models can be used for aspect-
specific summarization (Titov and McDonald, 2008;
Haghighi and Vanderwende, 2009), we use f-LDA
to extract snippets corresponding to fine-grained in-
formation patterns. Our results demonstrate that our
multi-dimensional modeling approach targets more
informative text than a simpler model (§4).

2 Analyzing Drug Trends on the Web
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999841304347826">
Recreational drug use imposes a significant burden
on the health infrastructure of the United States and
other countries. Accurate information on drugs, us-
age profiles and side effects are necessary for sup-
porting a range of healthcare activities, such as ad-
diction treatment programs, toxin diagnosis, preven-
tion and awareness campaigns, and public policy.
These activities rely on up-to-date information on
drug trends, but it is increasingly difficult to keep
up with current drug information, as distribution and
information-sharing of novel drugs is easier than
ever via the web (Wax, 2002). For the third con-
secutive year, a record number of new drugs (49)
were detected in Europe in 2011 (EMCDDA, 2012).
About two-thirds of these new drugs were synthetic
cannabinoids (used as legal marijuana substitutes),
which led to 11,000 hospitalizations in the U.S. in
2010 (SAMHSA, 2012). Treatment is complicated
by the fact that novel substances like these may have
unknown side effects and other properties.
Accurate information on drug trends can be ob-
tained by speaking directly with users, e.g. focus
groups and interviews (Reyes et al., 2012; Hout
and Bingham, 2012), but such studies are slow and
costly, and can fail to identify the emergence of
new drug classes, such as mephedrone (Dunn et
al., 2011). More recently, researchers have begun
to recognize clinical value in information obtained
from the web (Corazza et al., 2011). By (manu-
ally) analyzing YouTube videos, Drugs-Forum (dis-
cussed below), and other social media websites and
online communities, researchers have uncovered de-
tails about the use, effects, and popularity of a va-
riety of new and emerging drugs (Morgan et al.,
2010; Corazza et al., 2012; Gallagher et al., 2012),
and comprehensive drug reviews now include non-
standard sources such as web forums in addition to
standard sources (Hill and Thomas, 2011).
Organizing and understanding forums requires
significant effort. We propose automated tools to aid
in the exploration and analysis of these data. While
topic models are a natural fit for corpus exploration
(Eisenstein et al., 2012; Chaney and Blei, 2012), and
have been used for similar public health applications
(Paul and Dredze, 2011), online forums can be orga-
nized in many ways beyond topic. Guided by do-

main experts, we seek to model forums as a combi-
nation of drug type, route of intake (oral, injection,
etc.) and aspect (cultural settings, drug chemistry,
etc.) A multi-dimensional topic model can jointly
capture these factors, providing a more informative
understanding of the data, and can be used to pro-
duce fine-grained information such as the effects of
taking a particular drug orally. Our hope is that mod-
els such as f-LDA can lead to exploratory tools that
aide researchers in learning about new drugs.

2.1 Corpus: Drugs-Forum
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999979272727273">
Our data set is taken from drugs-forum.com, a
site active for more than 10 years with over 100,000
members and more than 1 million monthly readers.
The site is an information hub where people can
freely discuss recreational drugs with psychoactive
effects, ranging from coffee to heroin, hosting in-
formation and discussions on specific drugs, as well
as drug-related politics, law, news, recovery and ad-
diction. With current information on a variety of
drugs and an extensive archive, Drugs-Forum pro-
vides an ideal information source for public health
researchers (Corazza et al., 2012).
Discussion threads are organized into numerous
forums, including drugs, the law, addiction, etc.
Since we are modeling drug use, we focus on the
drug forums. Each thread is assigned to a specific
forum or subforum (drug) and each thread has a user
specified tag, which can indicate categories like “Ef-
fects” as well as routes of administration like “Oral.”
We organized the tags and subforum categorizations
into factors and components, as shown in Table 1.
We make use of these tags in §3.1.

3 Multi-Dimensional Text Models
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999977869565218">
Clinical researchers are interested in specific infor-
mation about drug usage, including drug type, route
of administration, and other aspects of drug use
(e.g. dosage, side effects). Rather than considering
these factors independently, we would like to model
these in a way that can capture interesting interac-
tions between all three factors, because the effects
and other aspects of drugs can vary by route of ad-
ministration. Oral consumption of drugs often pro-
duces longer lasting but milder effects than injec-
tion or smoking, for example. Many mephedrone
users report nose bleeds and nasal pain as a health
effect of snorting the drug: this could be modeled
as the triple (MEPHEDRONE,SNORTING,HEALTH), a
particular combination of all three factors.
To this end, we utilize the multi-dimensional text
model factorial LDA (f-LDA) (Paul and Dredze,
2012b), which jointly models multiple semantic fac-
tors or dimensions. In this section we summarize f-
LDA, then we describe an extension which incorpo-
rates user-generated metadata into the model (§3.1).
In a standard topic model such as LDA (Blei et
al., 2003), each word token is associated with a la-
tent “topic” variable. f-LDA is conceptually similar
to LDA except that rather than a single topic vari-
able, each token is associated with a K-dimensional
vector of latent variables. In a three-dimensional f-
LDA model, each token has three latent variables—
drug, route, and aspect in this case.
In f-LDA, each document has a distribution
over all possible K-tuples (rather than topics),
and each K-tuple is associated with its own word
distribution. Under this model, words are gen-
erated by first sampling a tuple from the docu-
ment’s tuple distribution, then sampling a word
from that tuple’s word distribution. In our three-
dimensional model, we will consider triples such as
(CANNABIS,SMOKING,EFFECTS).
Formally, each document has a distribution θ(d)
over triples, and each token is associated with a la-
tent vector z~ of size K=3. (We’ll describe the model
in terms of the three factors we are modeling in this
paper, but f-LDA generalizes to K dimensions.) The
Cartesian product of the three factors forms a set
of triples and the vector z~ references three discrete
components to form a triple t~= (t1, t2, t3). The car-

dinality of each dimension (denoted Zk) is the num-
ber of drugs, routes, and aspects, as shown in Table
1. Each triple has a corresponding word distribution
φ~t. The graphical model is shown in Figure 1.
One would expect that triples that have com-
ponents in common should have similar word
distributions: (CANNABIS,SMOKING,EFFECTS)
is expected to have some commonalities with
(CANNABIS,ORAL,EFFECTS). f-LDA models this
intuition by sharing parameters across priors for
triples which share components: all triples with
CANNABIS as the drug include cannabis-specific
parameters in the prior, and all triples with SMOK-
ING as the route have smoking-specific parameters.
Formally, φ~t (the word distribution for tuple ~t) has a
Dirichlet(�ω(~t)) prior, where for each word w in the

t�w is a bias parameter for word w for component
tk of the kth factor. That is, each drug, route, and
aspect has a weight vector over the vocabulary, and
the prior for a particular triple is influenced by the
weight vectors of each of the three factors. The
ω parameters are all independent and normally dis-
tributed around 0 (effectively L2 regularization).
The prior over each document’s distribution over
triples has a similar log-linear prior, where weights
for each factor are combined to influence the dis-
tribution. Under our model, θ(d) is drawn from
Dirichlet(B · a(d)), where · denotes an element-wise
product between B (described below) and a(d), with

Similar to the ω formulation, α(B) is a global
bias parameter, while the αD vectors are corpus-
wide weight vectors and αd are document-specific
weight vectors over the components of each fac-
tor. Structuring the prior in this way models the
intuition that if a triple with a particular compo-
nent has high probability, other triples containing
that component are likely to also have high proba-
bility. For example, if a message discusses triples
of the form (CANNABIS,*,EFFECTS), it is more
likely to discuss (CANNABIS,*,HEALTH) than (CO-
CAINE,*,HEALTH), because the message is about
cannabis.
Finally, B is a 3-dimensional array that encodes
a sparsity pattern over the space of possible triples.
This is used to accommodate triples that can be gen-
erated by the model but are not supported by the
data. For example, not all routes of administration
may be applicable to certain drugs, or certain aspects
of a drug may happen to not be discussed in the fo-
rum. Each element bt of the array is a real-valued
scalar in (0, 1) which is multiplied with �α(d)
t� to ad-
just the prior for that triple. If the b value is near
0 for a particular triple, then it will have very low
prior probability. The b values have Beta(γ0,γ1) pri-
ors (γ &lt; 1) which encourage them to be near 0 or 1,
so that they function as binary variables.
Posterior inference and parameter estimation con-
sist of a Monte Carlo EM algorithm that alternates
between an iteration of collapsed Gibbs sampler on
the z~ variables (E-step), and an iteration of gradi-
ent ascent on the α and ω hyperparameters (M-step).

In an unsupervised setting, there is no reason f-LDA

are tagged with labels corresponding to routes of ad-
ministration and other aspects (factors 2 and 3). Tags
for aspects are manually grouped into components:
e.g. USAGE (tags: Dose, Storing, Weight). Table 1
shows the factors and components in our model.
One could simply use these tags as labels in a sim-
ple supervised model—this will be our experimental
baseline (§4.1). However, this approach has limita-
tions in that most documents are missing labels (less
than a third of our corpus contains one of the labels
in Table 1) and many messages discuss several com-
ponents, not just the one implied by the tag. For
example, a message tagged “Side effects” may talk
about both side effects and dosage. While a super-
vised classifier may attribute all words to a single
tag, f-LDA learns per-token assignments.
We will instead use the tags to inform the priors
over our f-LDA word distribution parameters. We
do this with a two-stage approach. First, we use the
tags to train parameters of a related but simplified
model. We then use the learned parameters as priors
over the corresponding f-LDA parameters.
In particular, we will place priors on the ω vectors,
the Dirichlet hyperparameters which influence the
word distributions. Suppose that we are given a vec-
tor η(0) which is believed to contain desirable values
for ω(0), the weight vector over words in the corpus,
and similarly we are given vectors η(f) �over the vo-
cabulary for the ith component of factor f, which
are believed to be good values for ω(f)

is to fix ω as η, forcing the component weights to
match the provided weights. However, in our case η
will only be an approximation of the optimal com-
ponent parameters since it is estimated from incom-
plete data (only some messages have tags) and the η
vectors are learned using an approximate model (see
below). Instead, these weight vectors will merely
guide learning as prior knowledge over model pa-
rameters ω. While f-LDA assumes each ω is drawn
from a 0-mean Gaussian, we alter the means of the
appropriate ω parameters to use η.

w are corpus-wide bias parameters for
each word and ω(k)
iw are component-specific param-
eters for each word. This yields a hierarchical prior
in which η parameterizes the prior over ω, while ω
parameterizes the prior over φ (the word distribu-
tions). The resulting ω parameters can vary from the
provided priors to adapt to the data. An example of
learned parameters is shown in Figure 2, illustrating
the hierarchical process behind this model.
Learning the Priors In various applications, pri-
ors can come from many different sources, such as
labeled data (Jagarlamudi et al., 2012). We learn
the prior means η from tagged messages. However,
these parameters imply a latent division of responsi-
bility for observed words: some are present because
of the tag while others are general words in the cor-
pus. As a result, they must be estimated.
We learn these parameters from the tagged mes-
sages using SAGE, which model words in a docu-
ment as combinations of background and topic word
distributions. Eisenstein et al. (2011) present SAGE
models for Naive Bayes (one class per document),
admixture models (one class per token), and admix-
ture models where tokens come from multiple fac-
tors. We combine the first and third models, such
that a document has multiple factors which are given
as labels across the entire document—the drug type
and the tag, which could correspond to a component
of either the route or aspect factors. We posit the
following model of text generation per document:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.996522">
P (word w|drug = i, factorf = j) (4)

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.998669538461538">
This log-linear model has a similar form as Eq.
1, but with two factors instead of three, and it is
a distribution rather than a Dirichlet vector. As in
SAGE, we fix η(0) to be the observed vector of cor-
pus log-frequencies over the vocabulary, which acts
as an “overall” weight vector, while parameter esti-
mation yields η(f)
i , the logit parameters for the ith
component of factor f.1 These parameters are then
used as the mean of the Gaussian priors over ω.
Standard optimization methods can be used to es-
timate these parameters. The partial derivative of the

4 Experiments with Topic Modeling for
Extractive Summarization

Our corpus consists of messages from
drugs-forum.com (§2.1). The site catego-
rizes threads into many forums and subforums,
including some on specific drugs, which are cat-
egorized hierarchically. We treated higher-level
categories with pharmacologically similar drugs as
a single drug type (e.g. OPIOIDS, AMPHETAMINES);
for others we took the finest-granularity subforum
as the drug type. We selected 22 popular drugs and
from these forums we crawled 410K messages. We
selected a subset of tags to form components for
the route and aspect factors. (Some tags were too
general or infrequent to be useful.) A list of the
tags and drugs used appears in Table 1. We also
included a GENERAL component in the latter two
factors to model word usage which does not pertain
to a particular route or aspect; the prior parameters
η for these components were simply set to 0.
We wish to demonstrate that our modified f-LDA
model can be used to discover useful information in

forums, which will form the basis of our evaluation
experiments. Our goal is not to build a complete
summarization system, but rather to use the model
to direct researchers to interesting messages.
While we model all 22 drugs, our summa-
rization experiments will focus on five drugs
which have been studied only relatively recently:
mephedrone and MDPV (0-ketones), Bromo-
Dragonfly (synthetic phenethylamines), Spice/K2
(synthetic cannabinoids), and salvia divinorum. We
will consider these drugs in particular because these
are the five drugs for which technical reports were
created by the EU Psychonaut Project (Schifano et
al., 2006), an online database of novel and emerg-
ing drugs, whose information is collected by reading
drug websites, including Drugs-Forum. Extensive
technical reports were written about these five pop-
ular drugs, and we can use these reports to produce
reference summaries for our experiments (§4.2).
Of these five drugs, only salvia has its own sub-
forum; the others belong to subforums representing
the broader categories shown in parentheses. We
simply model the drug type as a proxy for the spe-
cific drug, as most of the drugs in each category have
similar effects and properties. The first two drugs are
both in the same subforum, so for the purpose of our
model we treat mephedrone and MDPV as the single
drug type, 0-ketones. These two drugs are grouped
together during summarization (§4.2), but the corre-
sponding reference summaries incorporate excepts
from the technical reports on both drugs.

4.1 Model Setup
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999973500000001">
Of the four drug types being considered for summa-
rization, our data set contains 12K messages with
one of the tags in Table 1 and 30K without. Of
those without tags, we set aside 5K as development
data. There are also over 300K messages (140K
tagged) from the remaining 18 drug types: some
of these messages are utilized when training f-LDA.
Even though we only consider four drug types in our
experiments, our intuition is that it can be benefi-
cial to model other drugs as well, because this will
help to learn parameters for the various aspects and
routes of administration. Our model of the effects of
mephedrone can be informed by also modeling the
effects of other stimulants such as cocaine.
Each message was treated as a document, and we
only used documents with at least five word tokens
after stop words, low-frequency words, and punc-
tuation were removed. The preprocessed data sets
contained an average of 45 tokens per document.
Below, we describe two f-LDA variants as well as
the baseline used in our experiments.
Baseline Our baseline model is a unigram lan-
guage model trained on the subset of messages
which are tagged. We treat the drug subforum as
a label for the drug factor, and each message’s tag
is used as a label for either the route or aspect fac-
tor. For example, the word distribution for the pair
(SALVIA,EFFECTS) is estimated as the empirical dis-
tribution from messages posted in the salvia forum
and tagged with “Effects.” We use add-A smooth-
ing where A is chosen to optimize likelihood on the
held-out development set.
This is a two-dimensional model, since we explic-
itly model pairs such as (MEPHEDRONE,SNORTING)
or (SALVIA,EFFECTS). However, we also cre-
ated word distributions for triples such as
(SALVIA,ORAL,EFFECTS) by taking a mixture
of the corresponding pairs: in this example, we
estimate the unigram distribution from salvia
documents tagged with either “Oral” or “Effects.”
Factorial LDA Because f-LDA does not rely on
tagged data (the tags are only used to create priors),
we can run inference on larger sets of data. The
drawback is that despite these priors, it is still mostly
unsupervised and we want to be careful to ensure
the model will learn the patterns we care about. We
thus add some reasonable constraints to the parame-
ter space to guide the model further.
First, we treat the drug type as an observed vari-
able based on the subforum the message comes
from, just as with the baseline. For example, only
tuples of the form (SALVIA,*,*) can be assigned to
tokens in the salvia forum. Second, we restrict the
set of possible routes of administration that can be
assigned to tokens in particular drug forums, since
most drugs can be taken through only a subset of
routes. For example, marijuana is typically smoked
or eaten orally, but rarely injected. We therefore
restrict each drug’s allowable set of administration
routes to those which are tagged (e.g. with “Oral” or
“Snorting”) in at least 1% of that drug’s data. Sim-
ilar ideas are used in Labeled LDA (Ramage et al.,

4.2 Summary Generation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999757096774193">
We created twelve reference summaries by edit-
ing together excerpts from the five Psychonaut
Project reports ((Psychonaut), 2009). Each refer-
ence is matched to drug-specific pairs and triples.
For example, a paragraph describing the dif-
ferences in effects of salvia between smoking
and oral routes was matched to distributions for
(SALVIA,EFFECTS), (SALVIA,SMOKING,EFFECTS),
(SALVIA,ORAL,EFFECTS). Descriptions of creat-
ing tinctures and blotters for oral consumption were
matched to (SALVIA,ORAL,CHEMISTRY). We con-
sider pairs in addition to triples because not all sum-
maries correspond to particular routes or aspects.
For each tuple-specific word distribution (a pair or
a triple), we create a “summary” by extracting a set
of five text snippets which minimize KL-divergence
to the target word distribution. We consider all over-
lapping text windows of widths {10,15,20} in the
corpus as candidate snippets. Following Haghighi
and Vanderwende (2009), we greedily add snippets
one by one with the lowest KL-divergence at each
step until we have added five.
We only considered candidate snippets within the
subforum for the particular drug, and snippets are
based on the preprocessed topic model input with no
stop words. Before presenting snippets to users, we
then map the snippets back to the raw text by taking
all sentences which are at least partly spanned by the
window of tokens. Because each reference may be
matched to more than one tuple, there may be more
than five snippets which correspond to a reference.

Recall that the reports used as reference summaries
were themselves created by reading web forums.
Our hypothesis is that f-LDA could be used as an
exploratory tool to expedite the creation of these re-
ports. Thus in our evaluation we want to measure
how useful the extracted snippets would be in in-
forming the writing of such reports. We performed
both human and automatic evaluation on the sum-
maries generated by f-LDA (variants 1 and 2) as well
as our baseline. We also included randomly selected
snippets as a control (five per reference).

Three annotators were presented snippets pooled
from all four systems we are evaluating alongside
the corresponding reference text. Within each set
corresponding to a reference summary, the snippets
were shown in a random order. Annotators were
asked to judge each snippet independently on a 5-
point Likert scale as to how useful each snippet
would be in writing the reference text.
The distribution of scores is shown in Figure 4 and
summarized in Table 2. Annotators generally agreed
on the relative quality of snippets: the average cor-
relation of scores between each pair of annotators
was 0.49. Snippets produced by f-LDA were given
more high scores and fewer low scores than the base-
line, while the two f-LDA variants were rated com-
parably. The breakdown is more interesting when
we compare scores for snippets that were matched

to word distributions for pairs versus word distri-
butions for triples. The gap in scores between f-
LDA and the baseline increases when we look at the
scores for only triples: f-LDA beats the baseline by
a margin of 0.45 for snippets matched to triples and
0.21 for pairs. This suggests that we produce better
triples by modeling them jointly. For triples, f-LDA-
2 (which uses more data) beats f-LDA-1 (which uses
only tagged data), while the reverse is true for pairs.
While some of the randomly selected control
snippets happened to be useful, the scores for these
snippets were much lower than those extracted
through model-based systems. This suggests that
exploring the forums in a targeted way (e.g. through
our topic model approach) would be more efficient
than exploring the data in a non-targeted way (akin
to the random approach).
Finally, we asked two expert annotators (faculty
members in psychiatry and behavioral pharmacol-
ogy, who have used drug forums in the past to study
emerging drugs) to rate the snippets corresponding
to mephedrone/MDPV. The best f-LDA system had
an average score of 2.57 compared to a baseline
score of 2.45 and random score of 1.63.

4.3.2 Automatic Evaluation of Recall
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999984222222222">
The human judgments effectively measured a
form of precision, as the quality of snippets were
judged by their correspondence to the reference text,
without regard to how much of the reference text
was covered by all snippets. We also used the au-
tomatic evaluation metric ROUGE (Lin, 2004) as a
rough estimate of summary recall: this metric com-
putes the percentage of n-grams in the reference text
that appeared in the generated summaries.
We computed ROUGE for both 1-grams and 2-
grams. When computing n-gram counts, we applied
Porter’s stemmer to all tokens. We excluded stop
words from 1-gram counts but included them in 2-
gram counts where we care about longer phrases.2
Results are shown in Table 2. We find that f-LDA-
1 has the highest score for both 1- and 2-grams, sug-
gesting that it is extracting a more diverse set of
relevant snippets. When performing a paired t-test
across the 12 reference summaries, we find that f-
LDA is better than the baseline with p-values 0.14
and 0.10 for 1-gram and 2-gram recall, respectively.
f-LDA’s recall advantage may come from the fact
that it learns from a larger amount of data and it
may learn more diverse word distributions by di-
rectly modeling triples. f-LDA-1 had slightly better
recall (under ROUGE), while f-LDA-2 was slightly
better according to the human annotators.

<bodyText confidence="0.9999795625">
We have proposed exploratory tools for the analy-
sis of online drug communities. Such communi-
ties are an emerging source of drug research, but
manually browsing through large corpora is imprac-
tical and important information could be missed.
We have demonstrated that topic models are capa-
ble of modeling informative portions of text, and in
particular multi-dimensional topic models can tar-
get desired structures such as the combination of as-
pect and route of administration for each drug. We
have presented an extension to factorial LDA tai-
lored to a particular application and data set which
was demonstrated to induce desired properties. As
a technical contribution, this study lays out practical
guidelines for customizing and incorporating prior
knowledge into multi-dimensional text models.

We consider such models for clinical research of new recreational drugs and trends, an important application for mining current information for healthcare workers. We use a “three-dimensional” f-LDA variant to jointly model combinations of drug (marijuana, salvia, etc.), aspect (effects, chemistry, etc.) and route of administration (smoking, oral, etc.) Since a purely unsupervised topic model is unlikely to discover these specific factors of interest, we develop a novel method of incorporating prior knowledge by leveraging user generated tags as priors in our model. We demonstrate that this model can be used as an exploratory tool for learning about these drugs from the Web by applying it to the task of extractive summarization. In addition to providing useful output for this important public health task, our prior-enriched model provides a framework for the application of f- LDA to other tasks.</abstract>

Topic models have been used for understanding the contents of a corpus and identifying interesting aspects of a collection for more indepth analysis (Talley et al., 2011; Mimno, 2011). While standard topic models assume a flat semantic structure, there are potentially many dimensions of a corpus that contribute to word choice, such as sentiment, perspective and ideology (Mei et al., 2007; Paul and Girju, 2010; Eisenstein et al., 2011). Rather than studying these factors in isolation, multi-dimensional topic models can consider multiple factors jointly. Paul and Dredze (2012b) introduced fact</context>

Many mephedrone users report nose bleeds and nasal pain as a health effect of snorting the drug: this could be modeled as the triple (MEPHEDRONE,SNORTING,HEALTH), a particular combination of all three factors. To this end, we utilize the multi-dimensional text model factorial LDA (f-LDA) (Paul and Dredze, 2012b), which jointly models multiple semantic factors or dimensions. In this section we summarize fLDA, then we describe an extension which incorporates user-generated metadata into the model (§3.1). In a standard topic model such as LDA (Blei et al., 2003), each word token is associated with a latent “topic” variable. f-LDA is conceptually similar to LDA except that rather than a single topic variable, each token is associated with a K-dimensional vector of latent variables. In a three-dimensional fLDA model, each token has three latent variables— drug, route, and aspect in this case. In f-LDA, each document has a distribution over all possible K-tuples (rather than topics), and each K-tuple is associated with its own word distribution. Under this model, words are generated by first sampling a tuple from the document’s tuple distribution, then </context>

The site is an information hub where people can freely discuss recreational drugs with psychoactive effects, ranging from coffee to heroin, hosting information and discussions on specific drugs, as well as drug-related politics, law, news, recovery and addiction. With current information on a variety of drugs and an extensive archive, Drugs-Forum provides an ideal information source for public health researchers (Corazza et al., 2012). Discussion threads are organized into numerous forums, including drugs, the law, addiction, etc. Since we are modeling drug use, we focus on the drug forums. Each thread is assigned to a specific forum or subforum (drug) and each thread has a user specified tag, which can indicate categories like “Effects” as well as routes of administration like “Oral.” We organized the tags and subforum categorizations into factors and components, as shown in Table 1.

Topic models have been used for understanding the contents of a corpus and identifying interesting aspects of a collection for more indepth analysis (Talley et al., 2011; Mimno, 2011). While standard topic models assume a flat semantic structure, there are potentially many dimensions of a corpus that contribute to word choice, such as sentiment, perspective and ideology (Mei et al., 2007; Paul and Girju, 2010; Eisenstein et al., 2011). Rather than studying these factors in isolation, multi-dimensional topic models can consider multiple factors jointly. Paul and Dredze (2012b) introduced factorial LDA (f-LDA), a general framework for multidimensional text models that capture an arbitrary number of factors (explained in §3). While a standard topic model learns distributions over “topics” in documents, f-LDA learns distributions over combinations of multiple factors (e.g. topic, perspective) called tuples (e.g. (HEALTHCARE,LIBERAL)). While f-LDA can model factors without supervision, it has not been used in situations where t</context>

Learning the Priors In various applications, priors can come from many different sources, such as labeled data (Jagarlamudi et al., 2012). We learn the prior means η from tagged messages. However, these parameters imply a latent division of responsibility for observed words: some are present because of the tag while others are general words in the corpus. As a result, they must be estimated. We learn these parameters from the tagged messages using SAGE, which model words in a document as combinations of background and topic word distributions. Eisenstein et al. (2011) present SAGE models for Naive Bayes (one class per document), admixture models (one class per token), and admixture models where tokens come from multiple factors. We combine the first and third models, such that a document has multiple factors which are given as labels across the entire document—the drug type and the tag, which could correspond to a component of either the route or aspect factors. We posit the following model of text generation per document: P (word w|drug = i, factorf = j) (4) exp(η(0) w + η(drug) iw + η(f) jw ) Ew/ exp(η(0) w/ + η(drug) iw/ + η(f) jw/) This log-linear mode</context>

Accurate information on drugs, usage profiles and side effects are necessary for supporting a range of healthcare activities, such as addiction treatment programs, toxin diagnosis, prevention and awareness campaigns, and public policy. These activities rely on up-to-date information on drug trends, but it is increasingly difficult to keep up with current drug information, as distribution and information-sharing of novel drugs is easier than ever via the web (Wax, 2002). For the third consecutive year, a record number of new drugs (49) were detected in Europe in 2011 (EMCDDA, 2012). About two-thirds of these new drugs were synthetic cannabinoids (used as legal marijuana substitutes), which led to 11,000 hospitalizations in the U.S. in 2010 (SAMHSA, 2012). Treatment is complicated by the fact that novel substances like these may have unknown side effects and other properties.

We show how to incorporate available information from these forums into f-LDA as a novel hierarchical prior over the model parameters, guiding the model toward the desired output (§3.1). We then demonstrate the model’s utility in exploring a corpus in a targeted manner by using it to automatically extract interesting sentences from the text, a simple form of extractive multi-document summarization (Goldstein et al., 2000).

Descriptions of creating tinctures and blotters for oral consumption were matched to (SALVIA,ORAL,CHEMISTRY). We consider pairs in addition to triples because not all summaries correspond to particular routes or aspects. For each tuple-specific word distribution (a pair or a triple), we create a “summary” by extracting a set of five text snippets which minimize KL-divergence to the target word distribution. We consider all overlapping text windows of widths {10,15,20} in the corpus as candidate snippets. Following Haghighi and Vanderwende (2009), we greedily add snippets one by one with the lowest KL-divergence at each step until we have added five. We only considered candidate snippets within the subforum for the particular drug, and snippets are based on the preprocessed topic model input with no stop words. Before presenting snippets to users, we then map the snippets back to the raw text by taking all sentences which are at least partly spanned by the window of tokens. Because each reference may be matched to more than one tuple, there may be more than five snippets which correspond to a reference. Figure 4: The distribution of a</context>

We also used the automatic evaluation metric ROUGE (Lin, 2004) as a rough estimate of summary recall: this metric computes the percentage of n-grams in the reference text that appeared in the generated summaries. We computed ROUGE for both 1-grams and 2- grams. When computing n-gram counts, we applied Porter’s stemmer to all tokens. We excluded stop words from 1-gram counts but included them in 2- gram counts where we care about longer phrases.2 Results are shown in Table 2. We find that f-LDA1 has the highest score for both 1- and 2-grams, suggesting that it is extracting a more diverse set of relevant snippets. When performing a paired t-test across th</context>

Descriptions of creating tinctures and blotters for oral consumption were matched to (SALVIA,ORAL,CHEMISTRY). We consider pairs in addition to triples because not all summaries correspond to particular routes or aspects. For each tuple-specific word distribution (a pair or a triple), we create a “summary” by extracting a set of five text snippets which minimize KL-divergence to the target word distribution. We consider all overlapping text windows of widths {10,15,20} in the corpus as candidate snippets. Following Haghighi and Vanderwende (2009), we greedily add snippets one by one with the lowest KL-divergence at each step until we have added five. We only considered candidate snippets within the subforum for the particular drug, and snippets are based on the preprocessed topic model input with no stop words. Before presenting snippets to users, we then map the snippets back to the raw text by taking all sentences which are at least partly spanned by the window of tokens. Because each reference may be matched to more than one tuple, there may be more than five snippets which correspond to a reference. Figure 4: The distribution of a</context>

These activities rely on up-to-date information on drug trends, but it is increasingly difficult to keep up with current drug information, as distribution and information-sharing of novel drugs is easier than ever via the web (Wax, 2002). For the third consecutive year, a record number of new drugs (49) were detected in Europe in 2011 (EMCDDA, 2012). About two-thirds of these new drugs were synthetic cannabinoids (used as legal marijuana substitutes), which led to 11,000 hospitalizations in the U.S. in 2010 (SAMHSA, 2012). Treatment is complicated by the fact that novel substances like these may have unknown side effects and other properties. Accurate information on drug trends can be obtained by speaking directly with users, e.g. focus groups and interviews (Reyes et al., 2012; Hout and Bingham, 2012), but such studies are slow and costly, and can fail to identify the emergence of new drug classes, such as mephedrone (Dunn et al., 2011).

We show how to incorporate available information from these forums into f-LDA as a novel hierarchical prior over the model parameters, guiding the model toward the desired output (§3.1). We then demonstrate the model’s utility in exploring a corpus in a targeted manner by using it to automatically extract interesting sentences from the text, a simple form of extractive multi-document summarization (Goldstein et al., 2000). In the same way that topic models can be used for aspectspecific summarization (Titov and McDonald, 2008; Haghighi and Vanderwende, 2009), we use f-LDA to extract snippets corresponding to fine-grained information patterns. Our results demonstrate that our multi-dimensional modeling approach targets more informative text than a simpler model (§4). 168 Proceedings of NAACL-HLT 2013, pages 168–178, Atlanta, Georgia, 9–14 June 2013. c�2013 Association for Computational Linguistics 2 Analyzing Drug Trends on the Web Recreational drug use imposes a significant burden on the health infrastructure of the United States and other countries.

Accurate information on drugs, usage profiles and side effects are necessary for supporting a range of healthcare activities, such as addiction treatment programs, toxin diagnosis, prevention and awareness campaigns, and public policy. These activities rely on up-to-date information on drug trends, but it is increasingly difficult to keep up with current drug information, as distribution and information-sharing of novel drugs is easier than ever via the web (Wax, 2002). For the third consecutive year, a record number of new drugs (49) were detected in Europe in 2011 (EMCDDA, 2012). About two-thirds of these new drugs were synthetic cannabinoids (used as legal marijuana substitutes), which led to 11,000 hospitalizations in the U.S. in 2010 (SAMHSA, 2012). Treatment is complicated by the fact that novel substances like these may have unknown side effects and other properties. Accurate information on drug trends can be obtained by speaking directly with users, e.g. focus groups and interviews (Reyes et al., 2012; Hout and Bingham, 2012), but such studies are s</context>
