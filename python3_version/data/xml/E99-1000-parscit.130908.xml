This volume contains the papers prepared for the Ninth Conference of the European Chapter of the
Association for Computational Linguistics, held 8-12 June in Bergen, Norway.
The conference programme features invited talks, tutorials, submitted papers in both main and student
sessions and a poster and demo session.
The main session Programme Committee received 99 abstracts from 20 countries around the world. Ev-
ery paper was reviewed by at least three reviewers via a web-based interface which preserved anonymity.
The fairness of the process is we think demonstrated by the broad spread of institutions and countries
represented in the papers which were accepted and are printed here: 29 papers from 12 countries, with
no country having more than 6 papers. The topics of the accepted papers cover a wide range of topics,
and taken together we think they present an exciting and up-to-date sample of the best work in our
field at the present time.
Our Area Chairs worked extremely hard in recruiting the Programme Committee, allocating papers to
reviewers and encouraging the completion of reviews on time, and then joined the Programme Chairs
for an intensive all-day meeting in Edinburgh where the final decisions were made. We are extremely
grateful to both the Area Chairs and the Programme Committee for their hard work.
We used a new web-based approach to managing the paper submission and reviewing process this year,
with authors registering an intention to submit electronically, and web-based reviewing processes, while
at the same time retaining paper submission of the manuscripts themselves. We&apos;ve had a lot of positive
feedback about the reviewing system from the Programme Committee. We hope the system worked for
authors as well.
Pulling together a meeting on this scale is a major effort, and thanks are due to many people for
making it happen: Bruce Croft and Wolfgang Wahlster for the invited talks; Walter Daelemans for
organising the tutorials and Robert Dale, Ronen Feldman, Adam Kilgarriff, Adwait Ratnaparkhi, Ehud
Reiter and Michael Rundell for preparing and delivering them; the EACL President (Donia Scott) and
past President (John Nerbonne) for their helpful suggestions; Gertjan van Noord for organising the
post-conference workshops and Jonas Kuhn and Avro Voutilainen for organising the student sessions.
We are also very grateful to the Local Organisation Committee Chair, Koenraad de Smedt, for his
patient cooperation with us over many issues, large and small, as well as his stirling efforts in making
sure we would actually have a conference at which these papers could be presented.
We also are indebted to Robert Inder made his web-based registration and reviewing system available
to us, and Richard Tobin helped us adapt it to our needs.
Local help in organising the Programme Committee meeting; with incoming and outgoing mail and
with producing these Proceedings was provided by Janet Forbes and Margaret McMillan, to whom
many thanks.

<bodyText confidence="0.998326235294118">
The student sessions have become an integral part of the EACL conferences. They provide an invaluable
opportunity for young researchers to present their work to the community and receive feedback for
future activities. In this spirit, we kept the tradition of encouraging students to submit not only papers
presenting completed work (like for the main sessions), but also reports on work in progress.
We received 17 submissions from 8 countries, of which we accepted 8 papers for presentation and two
as reserve papers. Each submission was reviewed at least by two student reviewers and one faculty
reviewer.
We would like to thank the 31 reviewers for their fair assessment and their detailed comments, which
we think were of great help for the student authors. Their names and affiliations are listed below.
We want to thank the Student Sessions Co-chairs of this year&apos;s ACL conference Melanie Baljko (Toronto,
Canada) and Anna Korhonen (Cambridge, UK), and the Student Session Chairs of previous ACL and
COLING-ACL conferences, in particular Pamela W. Jordan (University of Pittsburgh, USA), Maria
Milosavljevic (CSRIRO, Australia), and Dragomir R. Radev (Columbia University, USA), for providing
supporting material and for their cooperation. Finally, we want to thank the organizers of the main
conference, more specifically Koenraad de Smedt (Bergen, Norway), Alex Lascarides (Edinburgh, UK),
Giorgio Satta (Padova, Italy), and Henry Thompson (Edinburgh, UK), and the members of the Euro-
pean Chapter of ACL for their cooperation and help.

Practical Text Mining 0930-1300

Lecturer: Ronen Feldman (Bar-Ilan University)
The information age has made it easy to store large amounts of data. The proliferation of documents
available on the Web, on corporate intranets, on news wires, and elsewhere is overwhelming. However,
while the amount of data available to us is constantly increasing, our ability to absorb and process this
information remains constant. Search engines only exacerbate the problem by making more and more
documents available in a matter of a few key strokes. Text Mining is a new and exciting research area that
tries to solve the information overload problem by using techniques from data mining, machine learning,
NLP, IR and knowledge management. Text Mining involves the preprocessing of document collections
(text categorization, term extraction), the storage of the intermediate representations, the techniques to
analyze these intermediate representations (distribution analysis, clustering, trend analysis, association
rules etc) and visualization of the results. In this tutorial we will present the general theory of Text
Mining and will demonstrate several systems that use these principles to enable interactive exploration
of large textual collections. We will present a general architecture for text mining and will outline the
algorithms and data structures behind the systems. Special emphasis will be given to efficient algorithms
for very large document collections, tools for visualizing such document collections, the use of intelligent
agents to perform text mining on the internet, and the use information extraction to better capture the
major themes of the documents. The Tutorial will cover the state of the art in this rapidly growing area
of research. Several real world applications of text mining will be presented.

Natural Language Learning with the Maximum Entropy Framework 1400-1730
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.964226111111111">
Lecturer: Adwait Ratnaparkhi (IBM TJ Watson Research Center)
&amp;quot;Corpus-based&amp;quot; approaches to natural language processing (NLP), also known as &amp;quot;statistical&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;ma-
chine learning&amp;quot; approaches, have become popular in recent years due to the availability of large, anno-
tated corpora. This tutorial will discuss how to implement a corpus-based NLP tool with the maximum
entropy framework. We will first describe the maximum entropy framework, and then discuss its appli-
cation to several problems, including sentence boundary detection, part-of-speech tagging, prepositional
phrase attachment, parsing, and text categorization. Our experience has shown that this framework
yields consistently high accuracies, requires relatively &amp;quot;knowledge-poor&amp;quot; informants, and is highly re-
usable across tasks. A general outline of the tutorial:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.99938175">
1. What is the maximum entropy framework?
2. Using it for integrating diverse sources of evidence:
• Sentence Boundary Detection
• Part of Speech tagging
• Parsing
3. Using it with and without annotated data:
• Prepositional Phrase Attachment
4. Comparing its performance with other learning techniques:
• Text Categorization
• Incremental vs. Frequency-based feature selection
• Decision Trees (C5.0)
5. Summary: Advantages and Disadvantages of the framework

Building Natural Language Generation Systems 0930-1300

<bodyText confidence="0.967454214285714">
Lecturers: Robert Dale (MRI, Macquarie University), Ehud Reiter (University of Aberdeen)
Natural language generation (NLG) systems produce understandable texts in English and other human
languages from some underlying non-linguistic representation of information. NLG systems combine
knowledge about language and the application domain to automatically produce documents, reports,
explanations, help messages, and other kinds of texts.
In this tutorial we describe NLG from an applied system-building perspective: that is, we will explain
how NLG systems are built. Our presentation will be based on a popular architectural model which
encompasses the three stages of text planning, microplanning, and realisation. We will also give examples
of current NLG applications; discuss when NLG technology is and is not appropriate; and explore how
NLG can be integrated into multimedia, hypertext, and speech systems.
This tutorial should be useful for managers, implementors, and researchers. For managers, it will provide
a broad overview of the field and what is possible today; for implementors, it will provide a realistic
assessment of available techniques; and for researchers, it will highlight the issues that are important in
current applied NLG projects.

Lexicography for Computationalists 1400-1730
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.982283090909091">
Lecturers: Adam Kilgarriff (University of Brighton), Michael Rundell
NLP makes extensive use of dictionaries, but frequently proceeds in ignorance of lexicography. Even on
computational lexicography projects, workers rarely have a background in lexicography. If workers in
NLP were better informed about how dictionaries were produced, the purposes they were designed to
serve, and what distinguished good dictionaries from bad ones, they would be better placed to choose
a dictionary and to exploit the information it contained.
The tutorial will describe the goals and practices of corpus-based dictionary-making. Participants will
gain an appreciation of the kinds of judgements that lexicographers need to make every day and the
criteria they use. The tutorial will include practical exercises.
We shall also discuss models for lexicography/NLP collaboration, including SENSEVAL, the recent
evaluation exercise for word sense disambiguation programs.

<note confidence="0.806597">This volume contains the papers prepared for the Ninth Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics, held 8-12 June in Bergen, Norway. The conference programme features invited talks, tutorials, submitted papers in both main and student</note>
<abstract confidence="0.997839548387097">sessions and a poster and demo session. The main session Programme Committee received 99 abstracts from 20 countries around the world. Every paper was reviewed by at least three reviewers via a web-based interface which preserved anonymity. The fairness of the process is we think demonstrated by the broad spread of institutions and countries represented in the papers which were accepted and are printed here: 29 papers from 12 countries, with no country having more than 6 papers. The topics of the accepted papers cover a wide range of topics, and taken together we think they present an exciting and up-to-date sample of the best work in our field at the present time. Our Area Chairs worked extremely hard in recruiting the Programme Committee, allocating papers to reviewers and encouraging the completion of reviews on time, and then joined the Programme Chairs for an intensive all-day meeting in Edinburgh where the final decisions were made. We are extremely grateful to both the Area Chairs and the Programme Committee for their hard work. We used a new web-based approach to managing the paper submission and reviewing process this year, with authors registering an intention to submit electronically, and web-based reviewing processes, while at the same time retaining paper submission of the manuscripts themselves. We&apos;ve had a lot of positive feedback about the reviewing system from the Programme Committee. We hope the system worked for authors as well. Pulling together a meeting on this scale is a major effort, and thanks are due to many people for making it happen: Bruce Croft and Wolfgang Wahlster for the invited talks; Walter Daelemans for organising the tutorials and Robert Dale, Ronen Feldman, Adam Kilgarriff, Adwait Ratnaparkhi, Ehud Reiter and Michael Rundell for preparing and delivering them; the EACL President (Donia Scott) and past President (John Nerbonne) for their helpful suggestions; Gertjan van Noord for organising the post-conference workshops and Jonas Kuhn and Avro Voutilainen for organising the student sessions. We are also very grateful to the Local Organisation Committee Chair, Koenraad de Smedt, for his patient cooperation with us over many issues, large and small, as well as his stirling efforts in making we would actually conference at which these papers could be presented. We also are indebted to Robert Inder made his web-based registration and reviewing system available to us, and Richard Tobin helped us adapt it to our needs. Local help in organising the Programme Committee meeting; with incoming and outgoing mail and with producing these Proceedings was provided by Janet Forbes and Margaret McMillan, to whom many thanks.</abstract>

<title confidence="0.379507">Student Session Preface</title>
<abstract confidence="0.967435529411765">The student sessions have become an integral part of the EACL conferences. They provide an invaluable opportunity for young researchers to present their work to the community and receive feedback for future activities. In this spirit, we kept the tradition of encouraging students to submit not only papers presenting completed work (like for the main sessions), but also reports on work in progress. We received 17 submissions from 8 countries, of which we accepted 8 papers for presentation and two as reserve papers. Each submission was reviewed at least by two student reviewers and one faculty reviewer. We would like to thank the 31 reviewers for their fair assessment and their detailed comments, which we think were of great help for the student authors. Their names and affiliations are listed below. We want to thank the Student Sessions Co-chairs of this year&apos;s ACL conference Melanie Baljko (Toronto, Canada) and Anna Korhonen (Cambridge, UK), and the Student Session Chairs of previous ACL and COLING-ACL conferences, in particular Pamela W. Jordan (University of Pittsburgh, USA), Maria Milosavljevic (CSRIRO, Australia), and Dragomir R. Radev (Columbia University, USA), for providing supporting material and for their cooperation. Finally, we want to thank the organizers of the main conference, more specifically Koenraad de Smedt (Bergen, Norway), Alex Lascarides (Edinburgh, UK), Giorgio Satta (Padova, Italy), and Henry Thompson (Edinburgh, UK), and the members of the European Chapter of ACL for their cooperation and help.</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.957869448275862">The information age has made it easy to store large amounts of data. The proliferation of documents available on the Web, on corporate intranets, on news wires, and elsewhere is overwhelming. However, while the amount of data available to us is constantly increasing, our ability to absorb and process this information remains constant. Search engines only exacerbate the problem by making more and more documents available in a matter of a few key strokes. Text Mining is a new and exciting research area that tries to solve the information overload problem by using techniques from data mining, machine learning, NLP, IR and knowledge management. Text Mining involves the preprocessing of document collections (text categorization, term extraction), the storage of the intermediate representations, the techniques to analyze these intermediate representations (distribution analysis, clustering, trend analysis, association rules etc) and visualization of the results. In this tutorial we will present the general theory of Text Mining and will demonstrate several systems that use these principles to enable interactive exploration of large textual collections. We will present a general architecture for text mining and will outline the algorithms and data structures behind the systems. Special emphasis will be given to efficient algorithms for very large document collections, tools for visualizing such document collections, the use of intelligent agents to perform text mining on the internet, and the use information extraction to better capture the major themes of the documents. The Tutorial will cover the state of the art in this rapidly growing area of research. Several real world applications of text mining will be presented. Language Learning with the Maximum Entropy Framework Ratnaparkhi (IBM Watson Research Center) approaches to natural language processing known as &amp;quot;statistical&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;machine learning&amp;quot; approaches, have become popular in recent years due to the availability of large, annotated corpora. This tutorial will discuss how to implement a corpus-based NLP tool with the maximum entropy framework. We will first describe the maximum entropy framework, and then discuss its application to several problems, including sentence boundary detection, part-of-speech tagging, prepositional phrase attachment, parsing, and text categorization. Our experience has shown that this framework yields consistently high accuracies, requires relatively &amp;quot;knowledge-poor&amp;quot; informants, and is highly reusable across tasks. A general outline of the tutorial: 1. What is the maximum entropy framework? 2. Using it for integrating diverse sources of evidence:</abstract>
<title confidence="0.729795090909091">Sentence Boundary Detection • Part of Speech tagging • Parsing 3. Using it with and without annotated data: • Prepositional Phrase Attachment 4. Comparing its performance with other learning techniques: • Text Categorization • Incremental vs. Frequency-based feature selection • Decision Trees (C5.0) 5. Summary: Advantages and Disadvantages of the framework Natural Language Generation Systems</title>
<abstract confidence="0.954840730769231">Dale Macquarie University), Reiter of Aberdeen) Natural language generation (NLG) systems produce understandable texts in English and other human languages from some underlying non-linguistic representation of information. NLG systems combine knowledge about language and the application domain to automatically produce documents, reports, explanations, help messages, and other kinds of texts. In this tutorial we describe NLG from an applied system-building perspective: that is, we will explain how NLG systems are built. Our presentation will be based on a popular architectural model which encompasses the three stages of text planning, microplanning, and realisation. We will also give examples of current NLG applications; discuss when NLG technology is and is not appropriate; and explore how NLG can be integrated into multimedia, hypertext, and speech systems. This tutorial should be useful for managers, implementors, and researchers. For managers, it will provide a broad overview of the field and what is possible today; for implementors, it will provide a realistic assessment of available techniques; and for researchers, it will highlight the issues that are important in current applied NLG projects. for Computationalists Kilgarriff of Brighton), Rundell NLP makes extensive use of dictionaries, but frequently proceeds in ignorance of lexicography. Even on computational lexicography projects, workers rarely have a background in lexicography. If workers in NLP were better informed about how dictionaries were produced, the purposes they were designed to serve, and what distinguished good dictionaries from bad ones, they would be better placed to choose a dictionary and to exploit the information it contained. The tutorial will describe the goals and practices of corpus-based dictionary-making. Participants will gain an appreciation of the kinds of judgements that lexicographers need to make every day and the criteria they use. The tutorial will include practical exercises. We shall also discuss models for lexicography/NLP collaboration, including SENSEVAL, the recent evaluation exercise for word sense disambiguation programs.</abstract>
