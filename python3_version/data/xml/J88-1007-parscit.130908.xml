There are three major speech technologies: Speech
recognition involves having the computer translate from
human voice to data (typically text). Speech synthesis
involves translating from data (typically text) to speech.
Speech coding deals with the efficient storage and
transmission of voice communication. Using the com-
puter to process speech in these ways shows promise of
considerable economic impact. For instance, perfection
of these technologies means that every telephone world-
wide potentially becomes a terminal to every computer
database. In addition, the attempt to perfect these
technologies provides tremendous insight into human
speech. This is so even if one takes a purely &amp;quot;engi-
neering&amp;quot; approach; that is, even when no explicit
attempt is made to model how people accomplish these
tasks.
Computer Speech Processing, edited by Frank Fall-
side and William A. Woods, is a useful book in a field
that should be of considerable interest to computational
linguists. It contains several extremely strong chapters.
Peter Ladefoged&apos;s article should be required reading for
every engineer who might someday work in speech
technology. Bishnu Atal does an excellent job of cov-
ering linear predictive coding of speech including his
own recent important advance, multipulse. In this type
of technical material, though, errors become very con-
fusing. For instance, &amp;quot;The rms prediction error de-
creases fast for small values of p but decreases [more
slowly?] for higher values of p&amp;quot; (p. 92).
The chapter by Jonathan Allen is a good conceptual
introduction to speech synthesis, and the chapter by
Stella broadens our understanding of the issues and
presents a historical perspective.
We may roughly divide the speech synthesis problem
into two parts: translating from text into a series of
control signals; and, given a &amp;quot;hand-built&amp;quot; set of control
signals, building a mechanism for producing perfectly
intelligible, natural-sounding speech. John Holmes has
essentially solved the second half of this problem, and
his chapter reveals many details of his excellent system.
The first half of the problem is more oriented toward
linguistic problems and remains unsolved. In fact, a
complete solution probably subsumes the solution to
the general artificial intelligence problem of comprehen-
sion. For example, how can one perfectly apply correct
emphatic stress without comprehending? Issues of in-
tent, content, and anaphora quickly become involved
when one attempts to generate perfect prosody. How-
ever, the more modest goal of reading a sentence as a
native speaker might who was unaware both of the
meanings of the open-class words and of the context, is
slowly being approached. Computer Speech Processing
provides a good introduction to the issues, which, I
believe, should be of considerable interest to readers of
this journal.
The book as a whole also provides a good introduc-
tion to the issues of speech recognition. However, the
story here is much less clear to the reader. Approaches
to speech recognition vary greatly in how much they try
to do things &amp;quot;the way people do&amp;quot;. In fact, various
approaches are not just on a continuum, because there
are a number of separate decision points where one can
model, to a greater or lesser degree, human mecha-
nisms. At the &amp;quot;front-end&amp;quot;, there are a number of ways
to do the preliminary analysis of the speech signal.
Fallside&apos;s chapter illustrates some of the methods based
on frequency analysis. I find the chapter problematic,
however. Most fundamentally, it is not clear who the
intended reader is, nor the purpose. I do not believe it is
sufficient for the digital signal processing engineer who
wants to build a state-of-the-art &amp;quot;front-end&amp;quot;. Yet, I find
it hard to believe that even a mathematically sophisti-
cated linguist who does not already specifically know
digital signal processing will be able to learn these
techniques from the presentation. This is further com-
plicated by some apparent errors, e.g., the captions in
Figures 3.11 and 3.12. As an introduction, I also believe
the chapter needs some heavier caveats. One can easily
gain the impression that these methods work univer-
sally; e.g., that &amp;quot;pitch-trackers&amp;quot; are always accurate.
In fact, there is increasing use of &amp;quot;ear models&amp;quot; in
speech recognition front-ends. Bladon&apos;s chapter gives
one example of how normalization based on an ear
model simplifies the task of dealing with sex differences
in vowel space. The more linguistically oriented Chap-
ters 11 through 16 will be of substantial interest to
readers of this journal and deal primarily with the
&amp;quot;back-end&amp;quot; of speech recognition, namely using high-
er-order knowledge to improve recognition.
In summary, the book, like most edited volumes, is
somewhat uneven as to audience, goals, and style but
contains much that is worthwhile in a field of substantial
practical and theoretical importance.
