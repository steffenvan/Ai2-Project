This two-volume study is a very ambitious undertaking. As the author, Daniel Van-
derveken, explicitly states in the introduction to Volume I, the main purpose of the
book is to formulate (and formalize) the general principles that correlate sentence
meanings with speech acts in the use and comprehension of language. On the ba-
sis of these principles, the author aims to construct a general formal semantics for
natural languages that articulates the deep semantic structure common to all natu-
ral languages. In so doing, he intends to proceed to a partial unification of speech
act theory with classical truth-conditional formal semantics, thereby defining a line of
convergence between the two main trends of contemporary philosophy of language.
Yet Vanderveken aims even higher than this: &amp;quot;[t]he conclusions of the book are tran-
scendental. They state universal laws of language use and comprehension that reflect
the a priori forms of thought and of experience of human speakers&amp;quot; (p. 5).
By raising expectations to such a level, the author inevitably sets himself up for
failure—which is a pity, since the book is quite interesting and useful in what it does
accomplish. After presenting an outline of the book, I will offer brief critical comments
and then describe what I consider to be its major accomplishments for computational
linguistics.

1. Outline of the Book
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999395916666667">
The book—a follow-up of Searle and Vanderveken (1985)—attempts to formulate the
logic of illocutionary acts (Austin 1962). Illocutionary acts are &amp;quot;complete&amp;quot; speech acts
such as assertions, requests, promises, apologies, etc., in contrast with &amp;quot;incomplete&amp;quot;
ones such as referring and predicating. The first volume provides the meta-logical
foundations for the formal theory that is presented in the second volume.
Chapter 1 of the first volume explains the book&apos;s fundamental hypothesis, namely,
that illocutionary acts are the primary units of sentence meaning in the use and com-
prehension of natural language. It is this hypothesis that is the basis for Vanderveken&apos;s
claim that his illocutionary logic characterizes not only the semantic structure of lan-
guage, but the general structure of thought and experience.
In Chapter 2, Vanderveken incorporates general conditions of success and satisfac-
tion into his formal general semantics. Traditionally, a formal semantics of a language

deals with entities (assertions, sentences, or propositions) that are assigned truth values.
The goal of formal semantics, at least according to some, is to assign truth values to
sentences under an interpretation (Davidson 1984; Montague 1974). However, this rel-
atively simple picture is not adequate for a formal semantics of illocutionary acts. First,
some illocutionary acts (for example, commands) cannot be true or false (rather, they
are either satisfied or not satisfied). Second, illocutionary acts can either be successfully
or unsuccessfully performed, and Vanderveken takes the theory of the success under
interpretation of an illocutionary act to be as much a part of semantics as the theory of
satisfaction.
Every illocutionary act has two main components. One is the illocutionary force
that determines what kind of illocutionary act it is. The other is its propositional
content. Chapter 3 is Vanderveken&apos;s account of the logical form of propositions, while
Chapter 4 shows the logical forms of illocutionary forces. Each illocutionary force
consists of six components:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.997608909090909">
1. the illocutionary point (the general type of the speech act)
2. its mode of achievement (conditions on the way the speech act is to be
satisfied)
3. its propositional content conditions (what kind of propositions can
constitute its content)
4. its preparatory conditions (what must be true in the context of a
successful performance of the speech act)
5. its sincerity conditions (the mental states that the speaker is presumed to
have when the speech act is successfully performed) and
6. its degree of strength (e.g., the difference between a request and a
command).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999835142857143">
Chapter 5 states a series of &amp;quot;fundamental laws of language use that are both
philosophically and linguistically significant&amp;quot; (p. 5). For example, &amp;quot;the law of the a
posteriori truth of the propositional content of any satisfied utterance with the world-
to-words direction of fit&amp;quot;; translation: &amp;quot;[a] speaker who performs a speech act with the
aim of achieving a success of fit from the world-to-words direction [i.e., trying to make
the world fit the words and not vice versa] must express a proposition whose truth
is dependent on a future contingent action of one of the protagonists of the utterance;
otherwise, his speech act is not satisfiable&amp;quot; (p. 141).
Chapter 6 offers the semantic analysis of a large number of English performa-
tives. The discussion is surprisingly informal and in many cases goes little beyond
a dictionary entry (e.g., &amp;quot;To stipulate is to declare the terms under which something
is to be understood&amp;quot; p. 204), but the chapter contains interesting tree structures rep-
resenting how various illocutionary acts can be derived from other, more basic ones.
For example, in the tree of directives, one can see how from the performative suggest
one branch leads to recommend (through advice), while another branch leads to alarm
(through warn, caution, and alert).
The second volume is much more technical. The guiding idea of the entire project
is to construct an ideal formal language representing the logic of abstract illocutionary
acts, and then provide translation rules from English phrases to the formal language.
After a critical survey of earlier attempts to formalize the logic of speech acts and the
semantics of nondeclarative sentences (Chapter 1 of the second volume), Chapters 2

and 3 formally present a first-order logic of illocutionary acts; Chapter 4 presents the
logical syntax of the ideal object-language of the author&apos;s general semantics; Chapter 5
further develops the model theory of intensional logic in order to formalize the the-
ory of sentence meaning of general semantics; and Chapter 6 presents the axiomatic
system, which is generally complete in the sense that it axiomatizes the valid set of
laws of general semantics.
Chapter 7 should be the most interesting chapter for computational linguists. It
contains translation rules for a series of English performative verbs. The author ap-
plies the logical apparatus of his general semantics to English and states rules by
which a series of English performatives can be mapped onto specific illocutionary acts
expressed in the logic that the author has developed. Such rules of translation map
(aspects of) the syntactic structure of an English sentence onto the logical form of an
illocutionary act that is named by the performative in that sentence.
Volume II also contains three appendices. Appendix 1 (written with the collabo-
ration of David K. Johnston) is a completeness theorem for illocutionary logic. Ap-
pendix 2 (written with the collaboration of David K. Johnston and Francois Lepage)
shows the general completeness of the axiomatic system. Appendix 3 is a (much
needed) glossary/index of the symbols used in the book. A similar list of symbols
can also be found in the appendix to Volume I.

2. Critical Comments
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999978413793103">
The book combines three intellectual projects that, to a large extent, can be considered
separately. First, there is the underlying speech act theory, which is pretty much taken
as is from Searle (1969, 1971, 1979a, 1979b). Second, there is Vanderveken&apos;s impres-
sive formalization of it, and finally there are the cognitive and philosophical results
that Vanderveken claims are the consequences of his formalization. It is with these
supposed consequences that I have the most trouble.
Take, for example, Vanderveken&apos;s startling claim that illocutionary acts are the
&amp;quot;primary units of conceptual thought&amp;quot; (p. 56, italics his) and that &amp;quot;the universal laws
that govern the successful performance and satisfaction of illocutionary acts reflect
the a priori forms of thought and experience&amp;quot; (p. 226).
The major premise for this argument (and for the book as a whole) is that illocu-
tionary acts are the basic units of meaning in the use and understanding of natural
languages. What this means is that unlike the Fregean-Russellian tradition in which
the meaning of a word is defined solely as its contribution to the meaning of the sen-
tence in which it occurs (and sentences, therefore, are the basic units of meaning), in
Vanderveken&apos;s general semantics, the meaning of a word is taken to be its contribu-
tion to illocutionary acts that can be performed by sentences containing these words.
Generalizing this hypothesis, Vanderveken seems to claim that illocutionary acts are
also the basic units of conceptual thought, because any element of such thought—be
it a belief, a desire, or what have you—is nothing but a potential illocutionary act
waiting to be performed, and the meaning of any constituent of a conceptual thought
is nothing but its contribution to the illocutionary act that can express this thought.
I find Vanderveken&apos;s approach interesting and promising as far as the semantic
analysis of natural languages is concerned. But I don&apos;t believe it can be generalized
the way he intends it to be. First, the basic units of conceptual thought (whatever they
are) do not have conditions of success. A belief, like an assertion, may be either true
or false, but one cannot fail to have a wish in the same way that one can fail to issue a
successful command. Second, and more significantly, the semantics of illocutionary acts
cannot be the same as the semantics of conceptual thought, as I have shown elsewhere

(Kronfeld 1990). The reason, in a nutshell, is that one cannot have a belief about an
object without an individuating representation of that object, but in an illocutionary
act one can easily refer to an object without intending any particular individuating
representation of it to be part of the proposition that is the content of the speech act
(this feature of referring is entirely missing from Vanderveken&apos;s general semantics).
In other words, the semantics of illocutionary acts can (and must) accept singular
propositions. But the semantics of conceptual thought cannot.

3. Usefulness for Computational Linguistics
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999458363636364">
As mentioned above, the underlying speech act theory that this book adopts is Searle&apos;s.
The formal work, however, both here and in Searle and Vanderveken (1985), is entirely
Vanderveken&apos;s own. He is obviously a remarkably capable and creative logician who
has managed to build a very complex formal structure. This is a very impressive work
from a mathematical point of view.
Can his formal work be used in AT and computational linguistics? I think so.
Searle&apos;s (and Grice&apos;s) work on speech act theory communication intentions, and im-
plicatures was immediately recognized by computational linguists as important and
relevant to the field, especially when their approach is combined with the formal-
ization of another cognitive aspect of human activity namely, planning. One obvious
approach to modeling speech acts as a planned activity is based on two related ideas:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.76998375">
• Mental representations can be modeled by logical formulas.
• The process of planning to achieve a goal can be seen as a search for a
derivation proceeding from axioms representing the world as it is to
theorems that represent a world in which the goal is realized.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999376875">
The method for implementing these ideas in the simulation of planned speech acts has
always been to look for a formal system that is rich enough to capture central concepts
of communication, and then use it (see, for example, Cohen and Levesque 1990). Well,
Vanderveken offers a formal system that, in terms of its ability to capture concepts of
communication, is far richer than anything we have seen so far. It would be a waste
not to try to use it. The challenge, of course, is to develop further the translation rules
from English to the ideal language.
Vanderveken&apos;s formalism has other advantages as well. He offers a coherent and
interesting analysis of performative verbs and the way they are related to the illo-
cutionary acts they name. Taking the meaning of phrases to be their contribution to
possible illocutionary acts in contexts of use (instead of seeing them as contributing to
the senses of sentences), he can formally describe subtle differences between closely
related performatives and, for exactly the same reason, he can provide a formal anal-
ysis for words such as alas and hurray that all other formal semanticists simply had
no idea what to do with (except, perhaps, relegate them to the ever growing heap of
Gricean &amp;quot;conventional implicatures&apos; ).

4. Concluding Remarks
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999759">
This is not an easy book to read. The second volume especially is not for the faint of
heart. If you have only a general interest in speech act theory, you are better off reading
Searle (although Chapter 3 of Volume I is a nice summary of the central concepts of
the theory).

If, on the other hand, you are a hard-core cognitive scientist with a solid back-
ground in mathematical logic, looking for new frontiers in your attempt to construct
computational models of speech acts and communication, this is the book for you. It
takes the basic insights of speech act theory and casts them in a way that may have
potential for significant computational development. Whether the direction outlined
in this book can actually be worked out remains to be seen, but it is definitely worthy
of attention.

They state universal laws of language use and comprehension that reflect the a priori forms of thought and of experience of human speakers&amp;quot; (p. 5). By raising expectations to such a level, the author inevitably sets himself up for failure—which is a pity, since the book is quite interesting and useful in what it does accomplish. After presenting an outline of the book, I will offer brief critical comments and then describe what I consider to be its major accomplishments for computational linguistics. 1. Outline of the Book The book—a follow-up of Searle and Vanderveken (1985)—attempts to formulate the logic of illocutionary acts (Austin 1962). Illocutionary acts are &amp;quot;complete&amp;quot; speech acts such as assertions, requests, promises, apologies, etc., in contrast with &amp;quot;incomplete&amp;quot; ones such as referring and predicating. The first volume provides the meta-logical foundations for the formal theory that is presented in the second volume. Chapter 1 of the first volume explains the book&apos;s fundamental hypothesis, namely, that illocutionary acts are the primary units of sentence meaning in the use and comprehension of natural language. It is this hypothesis that is the basis fo</context>
<context position="10935" citStr="Searle and Vanderveken (1985)" startWordPosition="1729" endWordPosition="1732">in an illocutionary act one can easily refer to an object without intending any particular individuating representation of it to be part of the proposition that is the content of the speech act (this feature of referring is entirely missing from Vanderveken&apos;s general semantics). In other words, the semantics of illocutionary acts can (and must) accept singular propositions. But the semantics of conceptual thought cannot. 3. Usefulness for Computational Linguistics As mentioned above, the underlying speech act theory that this book adopts is Searle&apos;s. The formal work, however, both here and in Searle and Vanderveken (1985), is entirely Vanderveken&apos;s own. He is obviously a remarkably capable and creative logician who has managed to build a very complex formal structure. This is a very impressive work from a mathematical point of view. Can his formal work be used in AT and computational linguistics? I think so. Searle&apos;s (and Grice&apos;s) work on speech act theory communication intentions, and implicatures was immediately recognized by computational linguists as important and relevant to the field, especially when their approach is combined with the formalization of another cognitive aspect of human activity namely, p</context>
