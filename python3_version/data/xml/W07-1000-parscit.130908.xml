1 Background and goals of the workshop
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999354">
Natural language processing has a long history in the medical domain, with research in the field dating
back to at least the early 1960s. In the late 1990s, a separate thread of research involving natural
language processing in the genomic domain began to gather steam. It has become a major focus of
research in the bioinformatics, computational biology, and computational linguistics communities. A
number of successful workshops and conference sessions have resulted, with significant progress in the
areas of named entity recognition for a wide range of key biomedical classes, concept normalization,
and system evaluation. A variety of publicly available resources have contributed to this progress, as
well.
Recently, the widely recognized disconnect between basic biological research and patient care delivery
stimulated development of a new branch of biomedical research—translational medicine. Translational
medicine, sometimes defined as the facilitation of “bench-to-bedside” transmission of knowledge, has
become a hot topic, with a National Center for Biocomputing devoted to this theme established last
year.
This workshop has the goal of addressing and bringing together these three threads in biomedical natural
language processing, or “BioNLP:” biological, translational, and clinical language processing.

<bodyText confidence="0.99977225">
The workshop received 59 submissions—almost twice the number of submissions of any previous
BioNLP workshop or conference session that we are aware of (31 for last year’s PSB session on New
frontiers in text mining, [18]). The submissions covered a wide range of topics from most areas of
natural language processing and from both the clinical and the genomics domains. There were 48
full-paper submissions and 11 poster submissions. A strong program committee comprising members
of the BioNLP community from North America, Europe, and Asia provided three reviews for each
submission. Out of the many strong pieces of work submitted, fourteen papers were accepted for oral
presentation, as well as nineteen posters. The subjects of the papers fell into five or six broad categories:

3 Themes in the papers
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98862675">
A number of trends were notable in the accepted papers. Compared to past years, the number of papers
on gene mention recognition was quite small. We did see strong work on named entity recognition for
new semantic classes, as well as on the gene normalization task.
There were also a number of papers on syntactic topics. Other than the pioneering work of the GENIA
group some years ago and two recent papers on parser evaluation [4, 5], there has been little work on
syntax in biomedical NLP to date. However, three papers on syntactic topics appear in this proceedings
volume–[12, 14, 15]. [15] is especially unique in dealing with an actual clinical application.
Lexical semantics and terminology also figured heavily in this year’s workshop. [16] discussed the
gene symbol disambiguation problem. [8] presented a system for mapping clinical terminology to lay
terminology. [6] presented work on the development of a corpus annotated with a semantic class of
entity that has previously received scant attention in the field. [7] explored the potential of domain-
specific semantic roles for use in information extraction and document classification. It is notable that
there were no papers on the classic “gene mention” problem; although it is clear that gene mention
recognition is not yet a solved problem [17], it is encouraging that work in this area is progressing, and
our sole paper on this task dealt with the more complex problem of recognizing nested entities [1].
The work on information extraction that appeared this year was often quite innovative. Chapman
described an extension of the NegEx algorithm to extract various kinds of context-establishing
information. [11] presented work on an unsupervised method for protein-protein interaction detection,
using graph-based mutual reinforcement.
Finally, three papers demonstrated the continued contribution of shared tasks to progress in the field.
[13] described a shared task that resulted in the public availability of a large document collection of
clinical texts. [2] used the data from that task and the associated evaluation itself to test a number of
hypotheses regarding the differences between published and clinical texts and regarding the portability
of text mining systems to new domains. [16] (also mentioned above in the context of lexical semantics
and terminology) utilitized data from the BioCreative shared tasks as a source of test data.
There were an encouraging number of papers that focussed on the usability and accessibility of text
mining and of information access systems. [9] describes a novel search interface, and provides valuable
insight into the design of usability studies. [8] (like [16], also mentioned above in the context of lexical
semantics and terminology) described a system that aids in the process of making medical information
more intelligible to the lay public.
There was a notable broadening of the types of genres of textual inputs that this year’s papers dealt with.
In previous years, most work has tended to deal with abstracts drawn from PubMed/MEDLINE or with
ontologies, with occasional forays into longer texts, such as full-text journal articles, or shorter ones,
iv
such as GeneRIFs. This year’s workshop contains work on newsfeeds [7], clinical data [2, 3, 12, 13],
full text [9], and speech [15]—a genre heretofore essentially entirely neglected in the BioNLP field.
Finally, the accepted posters reflect an enormously fertile field. The poster session includes much work
that would have had oral presentations in a less-competitive meeting. The topics of the posters cover a
range of subjects every bit as diverse and interesting as the work with oral presentation; the executive
committee regrets that time constraints did not allow for more of it to have oral presentations.

The biggest debt owed by the organizers of a workshop like this is to the authors who graciously chose
BioNLP 2007 as the venue in which to share the fruits of the countless hours of research that went
into the work submitted for consideration. The next-biggest debt is, without question, to the many
program committee members (listed elsewhere in this volume); they produced almost 180 reviews, on
a tight review schedule and with an admirable level of insight. We also thank Simone Teufel, the ACL
Workshop Chair, and Su Jian, the Publications Chair, for their patient responses to many inquiries over
the past few months. Finally, Laura Grushcow provided hours of invaluable assistance in the preparation
of the Proceedings volume.

There was a notable broadening of the types of genres of textual inputs that this year’s papers dealt with. In previous years, most work has tended to deal with abstracts drawn from PubMed/MEDLINE or with ontologies, with occasional forays into longer texts, such as full-text journal articles, or shorter ones, iv such as GeneRIFs. This year’s workshop contains work on newsfeeds [7], clinical data [2, 3, 12, 13], full text [9], and speech [15]—a genre heretofore essentially entirely neglected in the BioNLP field. Finally, the accepted posters reflect an enormously fertile field. The poster session includes much work that would have had oral presentations in a less-competitive meeting. The topics of the posters cover a range of subjects every bit as diverse and interesting as the work with oral presentation; the executive committee regrets that time constraints did not allow for more of it to have oral presentations. 4 Acknowledgements The biggest debt owed by the organizers of a workshop like this is to the authors who graciously chose BioNLP 2007 as the venue in which to share the fruits of the countless hours of research that went into the work submitted for consideration. The next-biggest debt is, without question, to the many program committee members (listed elsewhere in this volume); they produced almost 180 reviews, on a tight review schedule and with an admirable level of insight. We also thank Simone Teufel, the ACL Workshop Chair, and Su Jian, the Publications Chair, for their patient responses to many inquiries over the past few months. Finally, Laura Grushcow provided hours of invaluable assistance in the preparation of the Proceedings volume.
