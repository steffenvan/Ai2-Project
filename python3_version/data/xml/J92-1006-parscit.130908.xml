The interaction between theoretical and computational linguistics, while not often
acknowledged, undoubtedly had some influence in the relative failure of the previous
incarnations of Hudson&apos;s Word Grammar (also known as Dependency Grammar and
Daughter-Dependency Grammar) to capture the imagination in the same way that the
context-free phrase structure grammars of the 1980s did. Who needed nice theories of
syntax that had relationships between words expressed with pretty drawings when
one could have the infinitely more computable phrase structure rules? But Hudson was
undeterred, and perhaps in the vein of the mountain coming to Mohammed, he has
valiantly attempted in this volume to bring his theory of Word Grammar (WG) closer to
computational linguistics and AT. This is no mean feat for someone whose background
is firmly in theoretical linguistics, and a lack of familiarity with computational matters
is sometimes painfully clear. From the perspective of a computational linguist, some
of the explanations and definitions are rather unnecessary, but it must be assumed
that the book was primarily written with the theoretical linguist in mind.
The theory of WG originally set out to rival phrase-structure theories of gram-
mar, placing the emphasis on the word (hence the name Word Grammar) rather than
the phrase, clause, or sentence. Such concepts played no part in the theory at all,
which relied on dependencies between words (hence the original name of Depen-
dency Grammar). Thus, a phrase such as black dogs eat cats was analyzed as having
three dependency relations: between black and dogs, between eat and dogs and between
eat and cats.
The fact that Categorial Grammar has drawn much interest away from CF-PSGs
may mean that Hudson&apos;s theory now has a more prominent role to play, and this
book is certainly thought-provoking, if at times a little frustrating in the questions it
asks without answering. The book is divided into two parts, the first seven chapters
defining the theory, and the remaining seven providing an account of certain aspects
of English, principally syntax with a little morphology and semantics.
The theory has moved on quite substantially from previous versions, not only in
its form, but in its coverage. While the original theory was predominantly a theory of
syntax, the current version purports to be a theory of knowledge, both linguistic and
nonlinguistic. That over half of the book is given over to a (fairly substantial) grammar
of English, and is thus very linguistically dominated, is only partially countered by the
examples in the theory section relating linguistic phenomena to nonlinguistic concepts
that seem to require similar apparatus. These examples are interesting, and the broad
argument that the &amp;quot;bits of knowledge&amp;quot; that make up our linguistic competence are
only (possibly specialized) cases of our other knowledge is one that deserves closer
inspection. It goes without saying that in a book of this size it would be impossible
to cover the whole area in enough detail to permit definite conclusions about the

feasibility of the general theory, but it is always disappointing when a work discusses
such a wide area in fairly general terms and then goes into detail in only a small part
of it.
The upshot of this approach is that the reader is left with a fairly clear idea of what
the syntactic component of a WG would look like, but little else. Even the morphology
is restricted to simple orthographical suffixation in English regular morphology, giving
no clue as to how nonaffixational morphology, as found in sub-regular classes of
English words, as well as many other languages, might be handled. Similarly, while
examples of nonlinguistic applications of the type of constructions used to express
linguistic phenomena are given, it is difficult to imagine what any substantial body of
world knowledge might look like. And the total omission of an attempt at phonological
examples (although the claim that such information should be encodable in the same
way is made) seems a wise move, given that the orthographic rule that allows the
doubling of a consonant before a vowel (e.g., big/bigger) is:
type of next of complementary of doubling-consonant = vowel
This brings us to the actual formalism used. It is very like English, which has
never been known for its succinctness or easy computability. It therefore comes across
as something which would appeal to someone who would rather not think in formal
terms. The use, in addition, of the pronoun it, as in,
complementary of doubling-consonant = it + it
where it refers to the doubling-consonant, does seem to be taking things a little too
far, and when Hudson starts defining the use in some syntactic constructions of the
word it (in English as opposed to in his formalism) it is easy to get a little confused.
I had always thought that the reason for having formalisms that are distinct from the
language being analyzed was precisely to avoid this type of confusion.
The basis of the theory is that all knowledge can be defined in terms of a hierarchy
(like a semantic net) within which default inheritance operates. The principal point at
which it differs from other such theories (e.g., DATR, Evans and Gazdar 1989a, 1989b,
1990) is that inheritance is blocked not by means of a concept of &amp;quot;more general&amp;quot; or
&amp;quot;more specific,&amp;quot; where values given to the more specific concept override those given
to the more general, but by means of explicit blocking statements in the form of &amp;quot;NOT&amp;quot;
propositions. For example, the propositions defining the morphology of the irregular
verb go would include these two statements:
past-form of GO = &lt;went&gt;
NOT: past-form of GO = stem of it + mEd
(where mEd is the past-tense morpheme). The chief reason behind this is to enable
multiple inheritance in cases such as the verb dream, which (for most speakers) has
the two possible past-tense forms dreamt and dreamed. This would be handled in WG by
the omission of the NOT proposition blocking the inheritance of the regular form. This
is certainly something that deserves consideration. This sort of multiple inheritance is
not possible in DATR, and it is clearly a problem, but the cost to Hudson&apos;s theory of
such a fix would appear to be excessive. The number of irregular forms that require
NOT propositions would, I feel sure, exceed the number that need such multiple
inheritance, although it is not possible to judge whether or not this is the case from
this book, since at no point does Hudson give figures, nor does he give a listing of
any substantial fragment of the grammar.

The whole work would have been more convincing had Hudson included a sub-
stantial part of the grammar in list form to give one an idea of the kind of thing our
computer might have to deal with; yet even in the appendices he only gives a handful
of examples (14 verb entries, 22 noun entries), although it must be said that these
are reasonably representative and informative. The theory has, to some degree, been
implemented (Hudson 1989; Fraser 1987, 1988a, 1988b, 1989), but no discussion of this
enterprise is provided in this book, which covers just the theory. However, frequent
references are made to the implementability of the theory, and Hudson does claim that
although the grammar of English provided has not been completely implemented, he
believes that there are no significant unsolved problems that would prevent this.
WG does not make use of any notion of phrase or clause—all syntactic information
is about words, with the exception of the notion of &amp;quot;word-string,&amp;quot; which is needed
for coordination. Hudson uses word-string to mean simply whatever needs to be
coordinated, claiming that &amp;quot;because we have not used constituent structure elsewhere,
we are free to use it in the treatment of coordination, without constraints imposed by
other structures.&amp;quot; This may seem a plus to him, but to me it seems a distinct minus.
What is inherently special about coordination that it should require such a radical
departure from the apparatus needed to handle other constructions? Surely it is better
to be able to handle coordination within the framework used for other constructions
(albeit with some adjustments)?
The theory naturally has holes and is hindered to some degree by a formalism
that appears somewhat clumsy, particularly if a computer implementation is intended,
which it clearly is. It does, however, deserve consideration, in particular the arguments
relating to the inextricability of linguistic and nonlinguistic knowledge, which hint at
answers to many longstanding problems in the study of the higher levels of language.
It would be impossible in a single volume such as this to cover in detail all the ground
that is touched on, and Hudson, naturally enough for a linguist, sticks overwhelmingly
with linguistic matters, in spite of his aggressive arguments against such a separation.
It is to be hoped that someone (not necessarily Hudson himself) will take the theory
further out of the realm of language to see if his claims can be substantiated.

The theory has, to some degree, been implemented (Hudson 1989; Fraser 1987, 1988a, 1988b, 1989), but no discussion of this enterprise is provided in this book, which covers just the theory. However, frequent references are made to the implementability of the theory, and Hudson does claim that although the grammar of English provided has not been completely implemented, he believes that there are no significant unsolved problems that would prevent this. WG does not make use of any notion of phrase or clause—all syntactic information is about words, with the exception of the notion of &amp;quot;word-string,&amp;quot; which is needed for coordination.
