Welcome to the Coling Workshop on Cross Lingual Information Access.
Cross-lingual information access (CLIA) is concerned with technologies and applications that enable
people to freely access information expressed in any language which may differ from the query
language. As the web has grown to include rich contents in many different languages, and with rapid
globalization, there is a growing demand for CLIA. Ordinary netizens who surf the Internet for special
information and communicate in social networks, global companies which provide multilingual services
to their multinational customers, governments who aim to lower the barriers to international commerce
and collaboration and homeland security are in need of CLIA. This has triggered vigorous research and
development activity in CLIA. This workshop is the fourth in a series of workshops and aims to address
the need of CLIA. The previous three workshops were held during IJCAI 2007 in Hyderabad, IJCNLP
2008 in Hyderabad, and NAACL 2009 in Colorado.
In this workshop, in addition to Cross-lingual Information Retrieval (CLIR), the focus is on multi-
lingual information extraction, information integration, summarization and other key technologies
that are useful for CLIA. The workshop aims to bring together researchers from a variety of fields
such as information retrieval, computational linguistics, machine translation, and practitioners from
government and industry to address the issue of information need of multi-lingual societies. This
workshop also aims to highlight and emphasize the contributions of Natural Language Processing
(NLP) and Computational Linguistics to CLIA, in addition to the previously better represented
viewpoint from Information Retrieval.
The workshop received a total of fourteen submissions, out of which the proceedings includes ten
papers covering various aspects of this field. There are two papers on corpus acquisition. The papers by
Pattabhi et al. and Lejune et al. focus on acquiring multilingual documents on various topics. There are
three papers on bilingual lexicon acquisition. The papers by Okita et al. and Chatterjee et al. propose
methods for word alignment and lexicon extraction from parallel and comparable corpora, while the
paper by Rapp et al. proposes to learn dictionaries from monolingual corpora containing foreign
words. Tang et al. do named entity translation for cross language question answering applications
by combining a number of different sources, namely, machine translation, online encyclopedia and
web documents. Falaise et al. use a light ontology to extraxt content from multilingual texts and user
requests associated with images. Litvak et al. explore the performance of summarization methods
across two languages. The paper by Vachchani et al. presents studies on pseudo relevance feedback
utilizing multiple assisiting languages. Hajlaoui et al. discuss multilinguization and personalization in
natural language based systems.
Besides these contributed papers, the workshop features two invited talks. Professor Pushpak
Bhattacharya will speak on word sense disambiguation and information retrieval. Dr Tetsuya Sakai
will speak on multilinguality at NTCIR.
With this gamut of topics, we look forward to a lively exchange of ideas in the workshop.
We take this opportunity to thank all the members of the Program Committee for their timely and
insightful reviews, to the two invited speakers for kindly agreeing to speak at the workshop, the authors
iii
who submitted their work to this workshop and all the participants of this workshop.
