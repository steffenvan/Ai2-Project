Welcome to the ACL Student Research Workshop! We had an amazing amount of student participation
this year. We received a record number of submissions – over 70 papers from students in 19 countries. In
order to accommodate the overwhelming response, we’ve expanded the Student Research Workshop. In
addition to the regular paper presentations it now includes a poster session. The acceptance rate for the
regular paper presentations was 11% (more competitive than the main conference!), and the acceptance
rate for the poster presentations from the remaining submissions was 28%. These proceedings contain
papers for both the regular and the poster presentations.
We are grateful to our faculty advisor, Regina Barzilay, and to Mary Harper of the National Science
Foundation for organizing sponsorship from the National Science Foundation for the Student Research
Workshop. The NSFs generous grant has paid for the conference registration fees for all of the student
workshop participants and a good portion of their travel expenses. We are also grateful for the Don and
Betty Walker International Student Fund which has provided assistance for two students who had their
work accepted in the main conference.
We would like to extend our thanks to the students and faculty on the program committee who dutifully
reviewed the papers and gave useful feedback to everyone who submitted papers, and to all the students
who submitted such excellent work.
