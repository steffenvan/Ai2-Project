In this thesis, a formal methodology to support reasoning with
imprecise knowledge in computer-based decision support
systems is developed. Many important decision problems are
highly unstructured, and cannot be solved adequately using
preset algorithms. Much of the complexity of such problems lies
in the reasoning needed to determine how to solve individual
problem instances. Existing decision support systems do not
provide much reasoning support, largely due to the difficulty of
representing and manipulating the fragmented and imprecise
knowledge that is generally available. The methodology
developed in this dissertation provides a basis for the design of
Intelligent Decision Support Systems (IDSS) in which heuristic
problem solving methods can be used to support reasoning as
well as data retrieval and numerical computation.
The dissertation consists of three parts. First, a logic based
framework for reasoning is developed. The basic constructs of
First Order Logic (FOL) are supplemented with constructs and
mechanisms for automatic model manipulation, resulting in a
powerful framework for IDSS development. Next, the need to
distinguish between two different sources of imprecision, namely
fuzziness and uncertainty is established, and methods for
formally representing and mechanically manipulating fuzzy and/
or uncertain knowledge within the logic framework are
developed. Finally, the strengths of the imprecise reasoning
methodology are demonstrated by implementing a prototype
IDSS to support imprecise reasoning and examining the
prototype&apos;s performance on sample problems.

This research shows how IDSS can be developed for
unstructured problems even when the available knowledge is
imprecise, and also demonstrates the versatility of such a
system. For instance, the imprecision measures provide useful
bases for comparing alternative solutions, even solutions that
are &amp;quot;close misses&amp;quot;; evaluation of solutions is also possible for
each subproblem. Information about imprecision can be used
not only to interpret solutions, but also to control the problem
solving process itself. Furthermore, the generation of useful
results is often possible even if some of the available
information is highly imprecise, sometimes even if some
information is missing. Such features can be very useful in
supporting unstructured decision making, yet cannot readily be
supported by a system limited to precise reasoning.

AHA delivers semantic help to users of interactive systems. It
possesses the following six capabilities: (1) it can report the
user&apos;s current state; (2) it can list all of the commands which
are legal in the user&apos;s current state; (3) it can explain the
meaning of a given command; (4) it can explain how the user
got to the current state; (5) it can explain the consequences of
the issuance of hypothetical commands from the current state;
(6) it can tell the user how to get to a goal state, and if
requested, explain why this will do the job. Knowledge about
the software is represented through algebraic specification and
question answering is handled by a resolution-based theorem
prover with demodulation for the treatment of equality. A
demonstration version is implemented for a subset of DEC
command language.
Intelligent behavior relies heavily on the ability to reason in the
absence of complete information. Until recently, there has been
little work done on developing a formal understanding of how
such reasoning can be performed. We focus on two aspects of
this problem: default or prototypical reasoning, and closed-world
or circumscriptive reasoning.
After surveying the work in the field, we concentrate on
Reiter&apos;s default logic and the various circumscriptive formalisms
developed by McCarthy and others. Taking a largely semantic
approach, we develop and/or extend model-theoretic semantics
for the formalisms in question. These and other tools are then
used to chart the capabilities, limitations, and interrelationships
of the various approaches.
It is argued that the formal systems considered, while
interesting in their own rights, have an important role as specifi-
cation/evaluation tools vis-a-vis explicitly computational
approaches. An application of these principles is given in the
formalization of inheritance networks in the presence of
exceptions, using default logic.

Natural language dialogue is a continuous, unified phenomenon.
Speakers use their conversational context to simplify individual
utterances through a number of linguistic devices, including
ellipsis and definite references. Yet most computational systems
for using natural language treat individual utterances as separate
entities, and have distinctly separate processes for handling
ellipsis, definite references, and other dialogue phenomena.
The computational system presented here, Psli3, uses the
uniform framework of a production system architecture to carry
out natural language understanding and generation in a well-
integrated way. This is demonstrated primarily using
intersentential ellipsis resolution, in addition to examples of
definite reference resolution and interactive error correction.
The system&apos;s conversational context arises naturally as the
result of the persistence of the internal representations of
previous utterances in working memory. Natural language input
is interpreted within this framework using a modification of the
syntactic technique of chart parsing, extended to include
semantics, and adapted to the production system architecture. It
provides a graceful way of handling ambiguity within this
architecture, and allows separate knowledge sources to interact
smoothly across different utterances in a highly integrated
fashion.
The design of this system demonstrates how flexible and
natural user interactions can be carried out using a system with
a naturally flexible control structure. A processing-based
taxonomy for ellipsis resolution that we developed is used to
analyze our coverage of intersentential ellipsis. The semantic
chart parser is further extended to allow several closely related
sentences to be treated in a single chart. This allows the
relationship between the sentences to be used in a simple way
to select between competing alternative interpretations, and
provides a natural means of resolving complex elliptical
utterances.
We describe this system in detail, and include a number of
extensive examples of the system&apos;s processing during user
interactions.
Artificial intelligence reasoning systems commonly contain a
large corpus of declarative knowledge, called a knowledge base
(KB), and provide facilities with which the system&apos;s components
can retrieve this knowledge. This thesis sets out to study the
very nature of retrieval. Formal specifications that capture
certain informal intuitions about retrieval are developed, studied,
and implemented by retrieval algorithms.
Consistent with the necessity for fast retrieval is the guiding
intuition that a retriever is, at least in simple cases, a pattern
matcher, though in more complex cases it may perform selected
inferences such as property inheritance.
Seemingly at odds with this intuition, this thesis views the
entire process of retrieval as a form of inference and hence the
KB as a representation, not merely a data structure. A retriever
makes a limited attempt to prove that a queried sentence is a
logical consequence of the KB. When constrained by the no-
chaining restriction, inference becomes indistinguishable from
pattern-matching. Imagining the KB divided into quanta, a
retriever that respects this restriction cannot combine two
quanta in order to derive a third.

The techniques of model theory are adapted to build non-
procedural specifications of retrievability relations, which
determine what sentences are retrievable from the KB&apos;s. Model-
theoretic specifications are presented for four retrievers, each
extending the capabilities of the previous one. Each is
accompanied by a rigorous investigation into its properties, and
a presentation of an efficient, terminating algorithm that
probably meets the specification.
The first retriever, which operates on a propositional
language, handles only yes/no queries, the second also handles
wh-queries, and the third allows quantifiers in the KB and the
query. Each is shown to be, in some sense, the strongest
retriever that meets the no-chaining restriction.
The third retriever forms an excellent basis for integrating a
specialized set of inferences that chain in a controllable manner.
This is achieved by incorporating taxonomic inference, such as
inheritance, to form the fourth retriever, an idealized version of
the retriever incorporated in the ARGOT natural language
dialogue system. It is characterized by its ability to infer all
consequences of its taxonomic knowledge without otherwise
chaining.
Feature structures are used for the representation of linguistic
information in several grammar formalisms for natural language
processing. These structures are a type of directed graph, in
which arcs are labeled by names of features, and nodes
correspond to values of features.
As a step in constructing a parser for a large Systemic
Functional Grammar of English, a general mapping is described
from systemic descriptions to the type of feature structures
used in Functional Unification Grammar. Experiments carried
out with a trial version of the parser revealed that existing
methods of unification could not effectively handle descriptions
containing a large amount of disjunction. Subtle difficulties were
also discovered in defining a precise interpretation for some
kinds of disjunctive feature descriptions.
In order to clarify the interpretation of feature descriptions, a
new sort of logic is developed. The formulas of this logic can
be precisely interpreted as descriptions of sets of feature
structures. A complete calculus of equivalences is defined for
these formulas, providing a sound basis for the simplification of
feature descriptions. The consistency problem for formulas of
the logic is shown to be NP-complete, with disjunction as the
dominant source of complexity. This result indicates that any
complete unification algorithm for disjunctive descriptions will
probably require exponential time in the worst-case. However,
an algorithm has been designed with a much better average
performance, by factoring formulas according to laws of
equivalence and using a method of successive approximation.
This algorithm has been implemented and tested as part of the
experimental parser for Systemic Functional Grammar with
favorable results. The implementation also extends the PATR-II
grammar formalism, by providing an effective way to use
disjunction in the statement of a grammar. The methods
presented are generally applicable to any computational system
which uses feature structures, as well as to the description of
large grammars for natural language analysis.
