ACL Book Series
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9824442">
A new book series has been announced by the
Cambridge University Press. It is entitled Studies in
Natural Language Processing, and has Aravind K. Joshi
as the General Editor.
The Association for Computational Linguistics is
sponsoring this series of monographs, texts, and col-
lections of papers on scientific and scholarly topics
which represent the range of professional activity of
concern to its membership. Methods of investigation
include the algorithmic, mathematical, and heuristic
methods of formal linguistics and artificial intelligence,
and the experimental methods of cognitive psychology
and psycholinguistics.
It is anticipated that books to appear in the series
will be of three general types: research monographs,
textbooks, and collections of papers. Research mono-
graphs, aimed at the professional reader, will be de-
tailed reports of significant research projects or litera-
ture reviews of a size beyond the compass of a journal
article. Appropriately revised doctoral dissertations of
particularly high quality may be considered for inclu-
sion in the series in this category.
Courses in computational linguistics are becoming
increasingly common in departments of linguistics and
computer science, and there are so far few, if any,
suitable textbooks. Students must rely largely on scat-
tered journal articles and instructors&apos; lectures. Propos-
als for texts by authors of established reputations in
the field will be entertained. A text might be in the
nature of a general survey, or might concentrate on
one of the major subareas of research.
The third category of books will be collections of
papers. These will in no case be proceedings of gener-
al meetings or otherwise heterogeneous collections.
Rather, each will be a thematically coherent set of
research reports bearing on a single, well-defined topic
of current significance, assembled under strong direc-
tion and control by an editor or editors who will be
responsible for the quality of all the contents, and who
will provide a unifying introduction. Such a collection
might result from a symposium on a particular topic,
to which the participants submit written papers. Or
chapters on various aspects of important problems in a
particular area may be especially commissioned by a
volume editor. Collections of already-published pa-
pers, in cases where the subject is a major and signifi-
cant one, the papers represent definitive treatments of
particular approaches to it, and the papers are in scat-
tered and perhaps not readily available sources, may
occasionally be considered.
The Editorial Board for the series consists of: Jona-
than Allen, M.I.T., Jaime Carbonell, Carnegie-Mellon
University, Eugene Charniak, Brown University, Paul
Chapin, N.S.F., Phil Cohen, Fairchild, Inc., Martha
Evens, Illinois Institute of Technology, Joyce Friedman,

ACL International Fund
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99190475">
At the Executive Committee meeting in Toronto on
June 19, 1982, we decided to establish a special fund,
the ACL International Fund, for the following purpos-
es:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.99897825">
• To make ACL memberships available to our col-
leagues who have special difficulties in paying
dues; for example, in cases where their national
currencies cannot be freely used in international
transactions.
• To make ACL publications available under the
same circumstances.
• And, possibly, to provide supplementary funds for
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.956216">
travel to colleagues whose participation in certain
meetings is especially warranted. However, such
disbursements would be relatively small and infre-
quent.
Any contributions you make to this fund are fully
tax deductible. Furthermore, you may request that
your contribution be used to provide memberships or
publications for particular colleagues or for colleagues
in a specified country or research group. The Execu-
tive Committee, which is responsible for allocating the
funds, will honor your requests as far as possible.
Please consider giving something to the fund, so that
the ACL can benefit from the widest possible partici-
pation of our colleagues in the discipline we all share.
Checks should be made payable to the ACL Inter-
national Fund and sent to:
