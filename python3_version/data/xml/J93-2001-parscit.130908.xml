The present study summarizes corpus-based research on linguistic characteristics from several
different structural levels, in English as well as other languages, showing that register variation
is inherent in natural language. It further argues that, due to the importance and systematicity
of the linguistic differences among registers, diversified corpora representing a broad range of
register variation are required as the basis for general language studies.
First, the extent of cross-register differences are illustrated from consideration of individual
grammatical and lexical features; these register differences are also important for probabilistic
part-of-speech taggers and syntactic parsers, because the probabilities associated with grammat-
ically ambiguous forms are often markedly different across registers. Then, corpus-based multi-
dimensional analyses of English are summarized, showing that linguistic features from several
structural levels function together as underlying dimensions of variation, with each dimension
defining a different set of linguistic relations among registers. Finally, the paper discusses how
such analyses, based on register-diversified corpora, can be used to address two current issues
in computational linguistics: the automatic classification of texts into register categories and
cross-linguistic comparisons of register variation.

As the use of computer-based text corpora has become increasingly important for re-
search in natural language processing, lexicography, and descriptive linguistics, issues
relating to corpus design have also assumed central importance. Two main considera-
tions are important here: 1) the size of the corpus (including the length and number of
text samples), and 2) the range of text categories (or registers) that samples are selected
from.&apos; Within social science, these considerations are associated with the two main
kinds of error that can threaten &apos;external validity&apos; (the extent to which it is possible
to generalize from a sample to a larger target population): &apos;random error&apos; and &apos;bias
error.&apos; Random error occurs when a sample is not large enough to accurately estimate
the true population; bias error occurs when the selection of a sample is systematically

1 Corpus designs can differ along several other parameters, including:
1. bounded/static versus unbounded/dynamic;
2. richly encoded versus minimally encoded (e.g., grammatical tagging, phonological/prosodic
encoding, tagging of social characteristics (of participants) and situational characteristics);
3. complete texts versus samples from texts;
4. selection of texts: convenience versus purposeful versus random within strata versus proportional
random.

different from the target population it is intended to represent. Both kinds of error
must be minimized to achieve a representative corpus.
Recent debates concerning the design of general purpose corpora have often di-
vided into two opposing camps emphasizing one or the other source of error: those
advocating large corpora versus those advocating &amp;quot;balanced&amp;quot; corpora (i.e., including
a wide range of registers). For example, the ACL Data Collection Initiative (DCI) and
the Linguistic Data Consortium are focusing on the rapid collection and dissemina-
tion of very large corpora, with relatively little attention to the range of registers; older
corpora, such as the Brown Corpus and LOB Corpus, are small by present-day stan-
dards but are explicitly structured to &apos;represent a wide range of styles and varieties&apos;
(Francis and Ktft&apos;era 1964 [cf. Johansson, Leech, and Goodluck 1978]). Projects such
as the COBUILD Corpus, Longman/Lancaster Corpus, and British National Corpus
(BNC) combine both emphases to varying extents.
Although all of these corpora could be considered &amp;quot;representative&amp;quot; of at least some
varieties of English, it is important to address the question of whether the varieties
represented match the intended uses of a corpus. For example, studies of a single
sublanguage are legitimately based on corpora representing only that variety, such
as journal articles on lipoprotein kinetics (Sager 1986), Navy telegraphic messages
(Fitzpatrick et al. 1986), weather reports (Lehrberger 1982), and aviation maintenance
manuals (Kittredge 1982).
One of the main issues addressed here, though, is whether general language stud-
ies must be based on a corpus that is register-diversified as well as large. Some pro-
ponents of very large corpora have suggested that size can compensate for a lack of
diversity—that if a corpus is large enough, it will represent the range of linguistic pat-
terns in a language, even though it represents only a restricted range of registers. Given
this assumption, linguistic analyses of any very large corpus could be generalized to
the entire language.
In contrast, I argue here that analyses must be based on a diversified corpus rep-
resenting a wide range of registers in order to be appropriately generalized to the
language as a whole, as in a dictionary or grammar of English, or a general purpose
tagging program for English.2 In fact, global generalizations are often not accurate at
all, because there is no adequate overall linguistic characterization of the entire lan-
guage; rather, there are marked linguistic differences across registers (or sublanguages;
cf. Kittredge 1982). Thus a complete description of the language often entails a com-
posite analysis of features as they function in various registers. Such analyses must be
based on corpora representing the range of registers.
In the following discussion, I first briefly illustrate the extent of cross-register
differences from consideration of individual grammatical and lexical features. Sec-
tion 2.1 focuses on the marked differences in the distribution of dependent clauses
across registers. This section then shows that register differences are also important
for probabilistic part-of-speech taggers and syntactic parsers, because the probabilities
associated with grammatically ambiguous forms are often markedly different across
registers. Section 2.2 focuses on adjectives marking &apos;certainty&apos; to illustrate how lexical
patterns are also distributed differently across registers.
Section 3 makes this point more strongly by describing a multidimensional anal-
ysis of numerous linguistic features in a register-diversified corpus of English. The
analysis shows that linguistic features from all levels function together as underly-

ing dimensions of variation, and that there are systematic and important linguistic
differences among registers with respect to these dimensions. The extent of those dif-
ferences clearly shows that linguistic analyses based on a restricted corpus cannot be
generalized to the language as a whole.
Section 4, then, shows how multidimensional analyses of register variation can
be used to address additional computational issues. First, Section 4.1 discusses the
application of the multidimensional model of English to predict the register category
of texts automatically with a high degree of accuracy. The predictive power of the
model at three levels of abstraction is tested. In Section 4.2, then, I turn to cross-
linguistic patterns of register variation, illustrating how multidimensional analyses of
register-diversified corpora in English, Nukulaelae Tuvaluan, Korean, and Somali en-
able register comparisons of a kind not otherwise possible, providing the background
for more detailed investigations of particular subregisters or sublanguages.

The analyses in this section illustrate the fact that there are systematic and important
grammatical and lexical differences among the registers of English; Section 2.1 treats
grammatical features and Section 2.2 discusses lexical features.

2.1 Grammatical Issues

<bodyText confidence="0.986650444444445">
2.1.1 Descriptive Analyses. One of the main uses of general text corpora has been
to provide grammatical descriptions of particular linguistic features, such as nominal
premodification structures, relative clauses, verb and particle combinations, and clefts
and pseudoclefts (see the numerous entries in the bibliography of corpus-based stud-
ies compiled by Altenberg [1991]). Two findings repeatedly come out of this literature:
first, individual linguistic features are distributed differently across registers, and sec-
ond, the same (or similar) linguistic features can have different functions in different
registers.
The linguistic description of dependent clauses in English illustrates these pat-
terns. Although these constructions are often treated as a single coherent system, the
various types of structural dependency actually have quite different distributions and
functions in English (cf. Biber 1988, 1992). For example, Table 1 shows that relative
clauses are quite frequent in official documents and prepared speeches but quite rare
in conversation. In contrast, causative adverbial subordination occurs most frequently
in conversation and is quite rare in official documents and press reports. Finally, that
complement clauses occur most frequently in prepared speeches, and with moderate
frequencies in conversations and press reports, but they are rare in official documents.
There is further variation within these structural categories. For example, most rel-

ative clauses in official documents have WH rather than that relative pronouns (7.7
out of 8.6 total), while the two types are evenly split in conversation (1.6 WH relative
clauses versus 1.3 that relatives). Although causative adverbial clauses are generally
more frequent in spoken registers, clauses headed by as/since occur almost exclusively
in writing (although they are relatively rare in both modes); clauses headed by because
are much more frequent in speech (Tottie 1986).
Biber (1992) uses confirmatory factor analysis, building on corpus-based frequency
counts of this type, to show that discourse complexity is itself a multi-dimensional
construct; different types of structural elaboration reflect different discourse functions,
and different registers are complex in different ways (in addition to being more or
less complex). The analysis further identifies a fundamental distinction between the
discourse complexities of written and spoken registers: written registers exhibit many
complexity profiles, differing widely in both the extent and the kinds of complexity,
while spoken registers manifest a single major pattern differing only in extent.
2.1.2 Probabilistic Tagging and Parsing. The differing distributions illustrated in Sec-
tion 2.1.1 have important implications for probabilistic tagging and parsing techniques,
which depend on accurate estimates of the relative likelihood of grammatical cate-
gories in particular contexts. Two kinds of probabilistic information are commonly
used in part-of-speech taggers: 1) for ambiguous lexical items, the relative probability
of each grammatical category (e.g., abstract as a noun, adjective, and verb); and 2) for
groups of ambiguous words, the relative probability of various tag sequences (e.g., the
likelihood of a noun being followed by a verb, adjective, or another noun).
To investigate whether grammatically ambiguous words have different distribu-
tions across registers, I compiled two separate on-line dictionaries from the LOB Cor-
pus: one based on the expository registers, and one from the fiction registers. Table 2
presents descriptive statistics from a comparison of these two dictionaries. The first
observation is that many words occurred in only one of the dictionaries. This is not
surprising in the case of exposition, since there were over twice as many lexical entries
in the exposition dictionary. However, it is more surprising that there were over 6000
words that occurred only in fiction. These included many common words, such as
cheek, kissed, grandpa, sofa, wallet, briefcase, intently, and impatiently.
A comparison of the probabilities of words occurring in both dictionaries is even
more revealing. One thousand ten words had probability differences greater than 50%,
while another nine hundred eighty words had probability differences greater than 30%.
These words represented many lexical types. For example, the first group of words
listed on Table 2 are past participle forms. There is a strong likelihood that the -ed
forms (i.e., admitted, observed, remembered, expected) will function as past tense verbs in
fiction (probabilities of 77%, 91%, 89%, and 54%) but as passive verbs in exposition
(probabilities of 67%, 45%, 72%, and 77%). The word observed shows a slightly different
pattern in that it has a relatively high probability of occurring as an adjective in
exposition (33%). In fiction, the -ed forms never occur as adjectives, apart from the 4%
likelihood for remembered. Finally, the two true participles (known and given) are most
likely to occur as perfect aspect verbs in fiction (65% and 77% likelihood), but they
are similar to the -ed forms in typically occurring as passive verbs in exposition (65%
and 71%).
The words in the second group on Table 2 represent noun/verb/ adjective am-
biguities. These include noun/verb ambiguities (trust, rule), -ing participles (thinking,
breathing), verb /adjective ambiguities (secure), and noun/adjective ambiguities (major,
representative). Apart from the last two types, these forms all show a strong likelihood
to function as verbs in fiction (62% to 92% probability). In contrast, these forms are

pronoun in fiction and exposition, but it is more likely to occur as a demonstrative in
fiction, and more likely as a complementizer in exposition.
Table 3 illustrates the same kinds of comparison for tag sequences. Although the
differences are not as striking, several of them are large enough to be relevant for
automatic tagging. For example, prepositions and nouns are considerably more likely
to follow singular nouns in exposition than in fiction. Similarly, nouns are more likely
to follow adjectives in exposition than in fiction. Passive verbs are considerably more
likely to follow the copula be in exposition than in fiction, while progressive verb
forms are more likely to follow be in fiction. Other differences are not great, but they
are consistent across tag sequences.
Finally, comparisons of this type are also important for syntactic ambiguities,
which are the bane of probabilistic parsers. To illustrate the importance of register
differences in this arena, Table 4 presents frequency counts for prepositional phrase

hand.) For editorials, this table shows that there is nearly a 50/50 split for preposi-
tional phrases attached as nominal versus verbal modifiers, with a slight preference
for nominal modifiers. In fiction, on the other hand, there is a much greater likelihood
that a prepositional phrase will be attached as a verbal modifier (78.7%) rather than a
nominal modifier (21.3%).
For any automated language processing that depends on probabilistic techniques,
whether part-of-speech tagging or syntactic parsing, the input probabilities are crucial.
The analyses in this section suggest that it might be advantageous to store separate
probabilities for different major registers, rather than using a single set of probabilities
for a general-purpose tool. Minimally, these analyses show that input probabilities
must be based on the distribution of forms in a diversified corpus representing the
major register distinctions; probabilities derived from a single register are likely to
produce skewed results when applied to texts from markedly different registers.

2.2 Lexicographic Issues

<bodyText confidence="0.999891727272727">
Text corpora have proven to be invaluable resources for research on word use and
meaning, as in Sinclair&apos;s pioneering work on the COBUILD Dictionary (Sinclair 1987).
In fact, corpus-based research shows that our intuitions about lexical patterns are
often incorrect (Sinclair 1991; 112 ff). However, similar to the patterns for grammatical
structures, for many words there is no general pattern of use that holds across the
whole language; rather, different word senses and collocational patterns are strongly
preferred in different registers.
This point can be illustrated from an analysis of certainty adjectives in English
(exploring in more detail some of the findings of Biber and Finegan 1989). Table 5

major text categories, and the London/Lund Corpus, made up of spoken texts from
six major text categories. The overall pattern shows certain and sure occurring with
approximately the same frequency in the written (Longman/Lancaster) corpus. In the
spoken (London/Lund) corpus, sure occurs more frequently than certain, and both
words are more common than in the written corpus. The word definite is relatively
rare in both corpora, although it is slightly more common in the written corpus.
Further, there are striking differences across written registers in the use of these
words. In social science, certain is quite common, sure is relatively rare, and definite
is common relative to its frequency in the whole written corpus. Fiction shows the
opposite pattern: certain is relatively rare, sure is relatively common, and definite is
quite rare. These patterns alone show that the semantic domain of certainty in English
could not be adequately described without considering the patterns in complementary
registers.
Table 6 shows, however, that the actual patterns of use are even more complex.
This table presents normalized frequencies (per 1 million words of text) of the major

in fiction. The collocational patterns (confirmed by concordance listings) identify two
surprising facts about these words: 1) certain is commonly used to mark uncertainty
rather than certainty; and 2) certainty is rarely expressed in social science at all. Thus,
the most common collocations for certain in social science reflect a kind of vagueness,
marking a referent as possibly being known (by someone) but not specified in the
text (e.g., a certain kind of. . . , in certain cases. . . , there are certain indications that.. .). These
collocations are relatively rare in fiction. In contrast, those collocational patterns for
certain that directly state that someone or something is certain—he/she/they/you/it + BE
+ certain and I/we + BE + certain—are extremely rare in social science but relatively
common in fiction.
Unlike the word certain, the term sure is most typically used to express certainty.
This is apparently the reason why the overall frequency of sure is so low in social
science. The difference between certain and sure, and between social science and fiction,
is perhaps most striking for the collocations of pronoun + BE + certain/sure. These
collocations are very common for sure in fiction; moderately common for certain in
fiction; but quite rare for either sure or certain in social science.
These examples illustrate the point that a corpus restricted to only one register
would enable at best a partial analysis of lexical use; and if the results were generalized
to the entire language, they would be incorrect. Thus, the major registers of English
must be treated on their own terms in order to provide a comprehensive analysis of

3. Multidimensional Differences among Registers in English
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999640653846154">
The inherent nature of register variation in English is illustrated even more clearly
in a series of studies using the multidimensional framework (e.g., Biber 1988, 1989,
1992). These studies have shown that there are systematic patterns of variation among
registers; that these patterns can be analyzed in terms of underlying dimensions of
variation; and that it is necessary to recognize the existence of a multidimensional
space in order to capture the overall relations among registers.
Each dimension comprises a set of linguistic features that co-occur frequently in
texts. The dimensions are identified from a quantitative analysis of the distribution of
67 linguistic features in the texts of the LOB and London-Lund Corpora. There is space
here for only a brief methodological overview of this approach; interested readers are
referred to Biber (1988; especially Chapters 4 and 5) for a more detailed presentation.
First, texts were automatically tagged for linguistic features representing several
major grammatical and functional characteristics: tense and aspect markers, place and
time adverbials, pronouns and pro-verbs, nominal forms, prepositional phrases, ad-
jectives, adverbs, lexical specificity, lexical classes (e.g., hedges, emphatics), modals,
specialized verb classes, reduced forms and discontinuous structures, passives, stative
forms, dependent clauses, coordination, and questions. All texts were post-edited by
hand to correct mis-tags.
The frequency of each linguistic feature in each text was counted, and all counts
were normalized to their occurrence per 1000 words of text. Then a factor analysis was
run to identify the major co-occurrence patterns among the features. (Factor analysis
is a statistical procedure that identifies groupings of linguistic features that co-occur
frequently in texts.) So that texts and registers could be compared with respect to the
dimensions, dimension scores were computed for each text by summing the major lin-
guistic features grouped on each dimension. Finally, the dimensions were interpreted
functionally based on the assumption that linguistic features co-occur in texts because

<bodyText confidence="0.997027714285714">
they share underlying communicative functions. Similarly, the patterns of variation
among registers were interpreted from both linguistic and functional perspectives.
Five major dimensions are identified and interpreted in Biber (1988; especially
Chapters 6 and 7).3 Each comprises a distinct set of co-occurring linguistic features;
each defines a different set of similarities and differences among spoken and written
registers; and each has distinct functional underpinnings. The five dimensions are
interpretively labeled:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9980768">
1. Informational versus Involved Production&apos;
2. Narrative versus Nonnarrative Concerns
3. Elaborated versus Situation-Dependent Reference
4. Overt Expression of Persuasion
5. Abstract versus Nonabstract Style
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999075423076923">
The primary communicative functions, major co-occurring features, and charac-
teristic registers associated with each dimension are summarized in Table 7. As this
table shows, registers differ systematically along each of these dimensions, relating
to functional considerations such as interactiveness, involvement, purpose, and pro-
duction circumstances, all of which have marked correlates in linguistic structure.&apos; To
illustrate these differences more concretely, Figure 1 presents the differences among
nine spoken and written registers within the two-dimensional space defined by Di-
mension 1: &apos;Involved versus Informational Production&apos; and Dimension 3: &apos;Elaborated
versus Situation-Dependent Reference.&apos;
The register characterizations on Figure 1 reflect different relative frequencies of
the linguistic features summarized in Table 7. For example, academic prose and news-
paper reportage have the largest positive scores on Dimension 1, reflecting very fre-
quent occurrences of nouns, adjectives, prepositional phrases, long words, etc. (the
&apos;informational&apos; features grouped on Dimension 1), together with markedly infrequent
occurrences of 1st and 2nd person pronouns, questions, reductions, etc. (the &apos;involved&apos;
features on Dimension 1). On Dimension 3, academic prose and professional letters
have the largest positive scores, reflecting very frequent occurrences of WH rela-
tive clause constructions (the features associated with &apos;elaborated reference&apos;), together
with markedly infrequent occurrences of time and place adverbials (the &apos;situation-
dependent&apos; features). At the other extreme, conversations have the largest negative
score on Dimension 1, reflecting very frequent occurrence of the &apos;involved&apos; features
grouped on that dimension (1st and 2nd person pronouns, questions, etc.) together
with markedly few occurrences of the &apos;informational&apos; features (nouns, adjectives, etc.).
Conversations also have a quite large negative score on Dimension 3, although broad-
casts have the largest negative score, reflecting very frequent occurrences of time and
place adverbials together with markedly few WH relative clauses, etc.

3 The factorial structure was derived from a common factor analysis with a Promax rotation. A
seven-factor solution was extracted as the most adequate, although only the first five factors are
presented here. The first factor in the analysis accounts for 26.8% of the shared variance, while all seven
factors together account for 51.9% of the shared variance. Further details are given in Biber (1988).
4 The polarity of Dimension 1 has been reversed to aid in the comparison to Dimensions 3 and 5.
5 See Biber (in press, b) for a comprehensive framework comparing registers with respect to their
situational characteristics, such as the relations among participants, purposes, production
circumstances, and typical topics.

As can be seen from Figure 1, these nine registers are strikingly different in their
linguistic characteristics, even within this two-dimensional space. When all six dimen-
sions are considered, these differences are even more notable. Table 8 further shows
that a significant and important amount of variation among texts can be accounted for
based on the register distinctions. It is important to emphasize here that the register
categories were not considered when the dimensions were originally identified; rather,
the dimensions represent the linguistic co-occurrence patterns across texts, regardless
of their register category. However, Table 8 shows that there are important differences

values show that the registers are strong predictors of linguistic variability along all
five dimensions.
Registers are defined in terms of their situational characteristics, and they can be
analyzed at many different levels of specificity.&apos; However, there are important linguis-
tic differences even among many closely related subregisters (Biber 1988; Chapter 8). A
complementary perspective is to analyze the total space of variation within a language
in terms of linguistically well-defined text categories, or text types (Biber 1989).7 Given
a text type perspective, linguistically distinct texts within a register represent different
types, while linguistically similar texts from different registers represent a single text
type.
In sum, all of these analyses show that there are extensive differences among
English registers with respect to a wide array of linguistic features. A corpus restricted
to any one or two of these registers would clearly be excluding much of the English
language, linguistically as well as situationally.

4. Further Applications of Corpus-Based Analyses of Register Variation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999804333333333">
The multidimensional model of register variation summarized in Section 3 can be used
to address additional computational issues. In this section, I focus on two of these: the
automated prediction of register category and cross-linguistic comparisons.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99744">
4.1 Automated Prediction of Registers
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.954842466666667">
One issue of current relevance within computational linguistics is the automated pre-
diction of register category, as a preliminary step to work in information retrieval,
machine translation, and other kinds of text processing. Because the model of register
variation summarized in the last section is multidimensional, with each dimension
comprising a different set of linguistic features and representing a different set of
relations among registers, it is well suited to this research question.
One statistical procedure commonly used for classificatory purposes is discrimi-
nant analysis. This procedure computes the generalized squared distance between a text
and each text category (or register), and the text is then automatically classified as
belonging to the closest category.8
To illustrate, Figure 2 plots the five-dimensional profiles of three target registers
(academic prose, fiction, and newspaper reportage) together with an unclassified text
6 Because registers can be specified at many different levels of generality, there is no &amp;quot;correct&amp;quot; set of
register distinctions for a language; rather, I have argued elsewhere that registers should be seen as
semi-continuous (rather than discrete) constructs varying along multiple situational parameters (Biber,
in press, b). Further, since registers are defined situationally rather than on a linguistic basis, they are
not equally coherent in their linguistic characteristics. Some registers have quite focused norms and
therefore show little internal linguistic variation (e.g., science fiction). Registers such as popular
magazine articles, on the other hand, include a wide range of purposes, and thus show extensive
linguistic differences among the texts within the register (cf. the investigations in Biber 1988, Chapter 8;
Biber 1990).
7 The statistical procedure used to identify linguistically well-defined text types is called cluster analysis.
This procedure identifies concentrations of texts such that the texts within each cluster, or text type, are
maximally similar to one another in their linguistic characteristics, while the types are maximally
distinct from one another. Biber (1989) identifies eight major text types in English, which are
interpretively labeled: Intimate Interpersonal Interaction, Informational Interaction, &amp;quot;Scientific&amp;quot;
Exposition, Learned Exposition, Imaginative Narrative, General Narrative Exposition, Situated
Reportage, and Involved Persuasion. Biber (in press, c) compares the text type distinctions in English
and Somali.
8 The SAS procedure PROC DISCRIM was used for the discriminant analyses in this section.

(which is in fact a social science academic article).9 With respect to Dimensions 1 and 4,
the unclassified text is about equidistant to the mean scores for academic prose and
newspaper reportage, but along Dimensions 2, 3, and 5, the unclassified text is much
closer to the target means for academic prose. Generalizing over all five dimensions,
this text has the smallest distance to academic prose and would be classified into that
category.
The predictive power of this five-dimensional model of variation was tested at
three levels of abstraction. The first test was based on texts from three high-level reg-
ister categories: newspaper articles (including press reportage, editorials, and reviews),
academic prose (including humanities, social science, medicine, natural science, and
engineering), and fiction. Table 9 presents the discriminant analysis results for these
categories. The top part of the table presents the calibration results: the model was

texts. The rates for successful prediction are high in all three cases. This model was
then tested on a new set of 124 &apos;unknown&apos; texts; the rates for successful classification
are still high (ranging from 68.89% to 84.62%), although not as high as in the calibration
data. Academic prose and fiction are clearly distinguished, with no misclassifications
between these two groups. Newspaper texts are less sharply distinguished from the
other two categories: 28.89% of the newspaper texts are incorrectly classified as aca-
demic prose; 27.5% of the academic prose texts are incorrectly classified as newspaper
texts; and 15.38% of the fiction texts are incorrectly classified as newspaper text8. Over-
all, though, the large majority of texts in these three categories are correctly classified
by the five-dimensional model.
Table 10 shows that roughly the same success rate can be achieved at a more spe-
cific level of prediction: distinguishing among press reportage, editorials, and reviews

however, a high success rate (ranging from 61.54% to 85.71%), suggesting that this
approach can be profitably used for prediction among closely related subregisters or
sublanguages.
The predictive power of this technique is only as robust as the underlying model
of variation. In the present case, that model represents multiple dimensions of lin-
guistic variation derived from analysis of a register-diversified corpus, and the results
achieved are generally robust for the successful prediction of different kinds of text at
quite different levels of abstraction.

research in this area has achieved high levels of success by focusing on very restricted
textual domains.
Kittredge (1982) adopts a variation perspective, comparing the extent of sublan-
guage differences within and across languages. Some of the provocative conclusions
of that study are:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.8709465">
• &amp;quot;the written style of English and French tended to be more similar in
specialized technical texts than in general language texts&amp;quot; (1982, p. 108).
• &amp;quot;parallel sublanguages of English and French are much more similar
structurally than are dissimilar sublanguages of the same language.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.986173">
Parallel sublanguages seem to correspond more closely when the domain
of reference is a technical one&amp;quot; (1982, p. 108).
The multidimensional framework provides a complementary approach to these
issues. From a linguistic perspective, dimensions are more readily compared cross-
linguistically than individual features, since structurally similar features often serve
quite different functional roles across languages. Similarly, cross-linguistic comparisons
of individual registers are more readily interpretable when they are situated relative
to the range of other registers in each language, since the &apos;same&apos; registers can serve
quite different functions across languages when considered relative to their respective
register systems.
To date, there have been multidimensional analyses of register variation in four
languages: English (summarized in Section 3), Nukulaelae Tuvaluan (Besnier 1988),
Korean (Kim and Biber in press), and Somali (Biber and Hared 1992, in press). In
each case, the description is based on analysis of a diversified corpus representing a
wide range of spoken and written registers. The cross-linguistic patterns of variation
represented by these four languages, both synchronic and diachronic, are discussed in
Biber (in press, c).

as markers of narration. In other respects, though, the multi-dimensional structure of
the two languages differ. For example, Somali has two dimensions marking different
kinds of interaction plus a third dimension relating to production circumstances; all of
these functions are combined into a single dimension in English (Dimension 1). Con-
versely, English Dimension 5 marks a passive, abstract style, which has no counterpart
in Somali.
One of the surprising findings from the comparison of all four languages (includ-
ing Nukulaelae Tuvaluan and Korean) is the extent of the cross-linguistic similarities
(see Biber, in press, c). Thus, all four languages have multiple dimensions reflecting
oral/literate differences, interactiveness, production circumstances, and an informa-
tional focus; these dimensions are defined by similar kinds of linguistic features, and
analogous registers have similar cross-linguistic characterizations along these dimen-
sions. In addition, two functional domains that relate to purpose are marked in all
four languages: personal stance (toward the content) and narration. These dimensions
also have similar structural correlates across the languages.
In contrast, there are fewer major differences among these languages in their pat-
terns of register variation. Dimensions relating to argumentation/persuasion are found
in only some languages, and there are other dimensions particular to a single language
(such as abstract style in English, and honorification in Korean). Analogous registers
show some differences cross-linguistically with respect to these latter dimensions plus
the purpose-related dimensions mentioned above (e.g., marking personal stance or
narration).
Findings such as these are directly relevant to several of the issues raised in re-
cent studies of sublanguages, since they can be used to specify the linguistic relations
among sublanguages both within and across languages. In particular, these analyses
support Kittredge&apos;s (1982) conclusion that parallel sublanguages across languages are
more similar in their linguistic structure than are dissimilar sublanguages within the
same language. Romaine (in press) discusses similar findings in a comparison of sports

here show that even when registers are defined at a high level of generality (e.g., con-
versation, fiction, academic prose), and even when comparisons are across markedly
different language families and cultures, parallel registers are indeed more similar
cross-linguistically than are disparate registers within a single language.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99994165">
In the present paper I have presented evidence from several different structural levels,
as well as different languages, showing that there are important and systematic lin-
guistic differences among registers. These data are used to argue for the general point
that corpora representing a broad range of register variation are required as the basis
for general language studies. In fact, the extent of register differences reported here
suggests that overall linguistic characterizations of a language are often inadequate (or
even incorrect). That is, since overall generalizations represent a kind of averaging of
the linguistic patterns in a language, they often do not accurately represent the actual
patterns of any register; in fact, such generalizations can conceal the systematic pat-
terns found across registers. An alternative approach is to recognize the centrality of
register differences and work toward a composite linguistic description of a language
in those terms.
Corpus-based analyses of register variation obviously need to be extended in sev-
eral ways. Future research should be based on larger corpora and include a wider
representation of linguistic features and registers. In addition, register distinctions can
be made at several levels of abstraction, and the intersection of register and text type
analyses needs to be further explored (see notes 6 and 7). The analyses summarized
here, though, clearly show the importance of a register perspective, supporting the
continuing development and analysis of large register-diversified corpora as the basis
for general language studies.

<abstract confidence="0.992818">The present study summarizes corpus-based research on linguistic characteristics from several different structural levels, in English as well as other languages, showing that register variation is inherent in natural language. It further argues that, due to the importance and systematicity of the linguistic differences among registers, diversified corpora representing a broad range of register variation are required as the basis for general language studies. First, the extent of cross-register differences are illustrated from consideration of individual grammatical and lexical features; these register differences are also important for probabilistic part-of-speech taggers and syntactic parsers, because the probabilities associated with grammatically ambiguous forms are often markedly different across registers. Then, corpus-based multidimensional analyses of English are summarized, showing that linguistic features from several structural levels function together as underlying dimensions of variation, with each dimension defining a different set of linguistic relations among registers. Finally, the paper discusses how such analyses, based on register-diversified corpora, can be used to address two current issues in computational linguistics: the automatic classification of texts into register categories and cross-linguistic comparisons of register variation.</abstract>

Similarly, cross-linguistic comparisons of individual registers are more readily interpretable when they are situated relative to the range of other registers in each language, since the &apos;same&apos; registers can serve quite different functions across languages when considered relative to their respective register systems. To date, there have been multidimensional analyses of register variation in four languages: English (summarized in Section 3), Nukulaelae Tuvaluan (Besnier 1988), Korean (Kim and Biber in press), and Somali (Biber and Hared 1992, in press). In each case, the description is based on analysis of a diversified corpus representing a wide range of spoken and written registers. The cross-linguistic patterns of variation represented by these four languages, both synchronic and diachronic, are discussed in Biber (in press, c). 237 Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 2 Table 12 Summary of functions, linguistic features, and characteristic registers for the five major Somali dimensions identified in Biber and Hared (1992).

The extent of those differences clearly shows that linguistic analyses based on a restricted corpus cannot be generalized to the language as a whole. Section 4, then, shows how multidimensional analyses of register variation can be used</context>
<context position="9570" citStr="Biber 1988" startWordPosition="1370" endWordPosition="1371"> in the bibliography of corpus-based studies compiled by Altenberg [1991]). Two findings repeatedly come out of this literature: first, individual linguistic features are distributed differently across registers, and second, the same (or similar) linguistic features can have different functions in different registers. The linguistic description of dependent clauses in English illustrates these patterns. Although these constructions are often treated as a single coherent system, the various types of structural dependency actually have quite different distributions and functions in English (cf. Biber 1988, 1992). For example, Table 1 shows that relative clauses are quite frequent in official documents and prepared speeches but quite rare in conversation. In contrast, causative adverbial subordination occurs most frequently in conversation and is quite rare in official documents and press reports. Finally, that complement clauses occur most frequently in prepared speeches, and with moderate frequencies in conversations and press reports, but they are rare in official documents. There is further variation within these structural categories. For example, most rel221 Computational Linguistics Volu</context>

Thus, the major registers of English must be treated on their own terms in order to provide a comprehensive analysis of either grammatical structures or lexical patterns of use. 3. Multidimensional Differences among Registers in English The inherent nature of register variation in English is illustrated even more clearly in a series of studies using the multidimensional framework (e.g., Biber 1988, 1989, 1992). These studies have shown that there are systematic patterns of variation among registers; that these patterns can be analyzed in terms of underlying dimensions of variation; and that it is necessary to recognize the existence of a multidimensional space in order to capture the overall relations among registers. Each dimension comprises a set of linguistic features that co-occur frequently in texts. The dimensions are identified from a quantitative analysis of the distribution of 67 linguistic features in the texts of the LOB and London-Lund Corpora. There is space here for only </context>

Finally, the dimensions were interpreted functionally based on the assumption that linguistic features co-occur in texts because 228 Douglas Biber Using Register-Diversified Corpora for General Language Studies they share underlying communicative functions. Similarly, the patterns of variation among registers were interpreted from both linguistic and functional perspectives. Five major dimensions are identified and interpreted in Biber (1988; especially Chapters 6 and 7).3 Each comprises a distinct set of co-occurring linguistic features; each defines a different set of similarities and differences among spoken and written registers; and each has distinct functional underpinnings. The five dimensions are interpretively labeled: 1. Informational versus Involved Production&apos; 2. Narrative versus Nonnarrative Concerns 3. Elaborated versus Situation-Dependent Reference 4. Overt Expression of Persuasion 5. Abstract versus Nonabstract Style The primary communicative functions, major co-occurring features, and characteristic registers ass</context>

A seven-factor solution was extracted as the most adequate, although only the first five factors are presented here. The first factor in the analysis accounts for 26.8% of the shared variance, while all seven factors together account for 51.9% of the shared variance. Further details are given in Biber (1988). 4 The polarity of Dimension 1 has been reversed to aid in the comparison to Dimensions 3 and 5. 5 See Biber (in press, b) for a comprehensive framework comparing registers with respect to their situational characteristics, such as the relations among participants, purposes, production circumstances, and typical topics. 229 Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 2 INFORMATIONAL Newspaper Academic 15 + reportage prose Newspaper 10 editorials 5 + Broadcasts Professional letters 0 Fiction -5 + -10 + -15 Spontaneous speeches -20 + Personal letters -25 + -30 -35 + Conversations INVOLVED +---+</context>

Four of the five dimensions have r2 values over 50%, with only Dimension 4 having a relatively small r2 value of 16.9%. These 232 Douglas Biber Using Register-Diversified Corpora for General Language Studies values show that the registers are strong predictors of linguistic variability along all five dimensions. Registers are defined in terms of their situational characteristics, and they can be analyzed at many different levels of specificity.&apos; However, there are important linguistic differences even among many closely related subregisters (Biber 1988; Chapter 8). A complementary perspective is to analyze the total space of variation within a language in terms of linguistically well-defined text categories, or text types (Biber 1989).7 Given a text type perspective, linguistically distinct texts within a register represent different types, while linguistically similar texts from different registers represent a single text type.

Further, since registers are defined situationally rather than on a linguistic basis, they are not equally coherent in their linguistic characteristics. Some registers have quite focused norms and therefore show little internal linguistic variation (e.g., science fiction). Registers such as popular magazine articles, on the other hand, include a wide range of purposes, and thus show extensive linguistic differences among the texts within the register (cf. the investigations in Biber 1988, Chapter 8; Biber 1990). 7 The statistical procedure used to identify linguistically well-defined text types is called cluster analysis.

In fact, corpus-based research shows that our intuitions about lexical patterns are often incorrect (Sinclair 1991; 112 ff). However, similar to the patterns for grammatical structures, for many words there is no general pattern of use that holds across the whole language; rather, different word senses and collocational patterns are strongly preferred in different registers. This point can be illustrated from an analysis of certainty adjectives in English (exploring in more detail some of the findings of Biber and Finegan 1989).

Similarly, cross-linguistic comparisons of individual registers are more readily interpretable when they are situated relative to the range of other registers in each language, since the &apos;same&apos; registers can serve quite different functions across languages when considered relative to their respective register systems. To date, there have been multidimensional analyses of register variation in four languages: English (summarized in Section 3), Nukulaelae Tuvaluan (Besnier 1988), Korean (Kim and Biber in press), and Somali (Biber and Hared 1992, in press). In each case, the description is based on analysis of a diversified corpus representing a wide range of spoken and written registers. The cross-linguistic patterns of variation represented by these four languages, both synchronic and diachronic, are discussed in Biber (in press, c). 237 Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 2 Table 12 Summary of functions, linguistic features, and characteristic registers for the five major Somali dimensions identified in Biber and Hared (1992).

For example, most rel221 Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 2 ative clauses in official documents have WH rather than that relative pronouns (7.7 out of 8.6 total), while the two types are evenly split in conversation (1.6 WH relative clauses versus 1.3 that relatives). Although causative adverbial clauses are generally more frequent in spoken registers, clauses headed by as/since occur almost exclusively in writing (although they are relatively rare in both modes); clauses headed by because are much more frequent in speech (Tottie 1986). Biber (1992) uses confirmatory factor analysis, building on corpus-based frequency counts of this type, to show that discourse complexity is itself a multi-dimensional construct; different types of structural elaboration reflect different discourse functions, and different registers are complex in different ways (in addition to being more or less complex). The analysis further identifies a fundamental distinction between the discourse complexities of written and spoken registers: written registers exhibit many complexity profiles, differing widely in both the extent and the kinds of complexi</context>
