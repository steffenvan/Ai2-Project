Indexing and retrieving broadcast news stories
within a large collection requires automatic de-
tection of story boundaries. This video news
story segmentation can use a wide range of au-
dio, language, video, and image features. In
this paper, we investigate the correlation be-
tween automatically-derived multimodal fea-
tures and story boundaries in seven different
broadcast news sources in three languages. We
identify several features that are important for
all seven sources analyzed, and we discuss the
contributions of other features that are impor-

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999955368421053">
Indexing and retrieving stories within a large collection
of video requires automatic detection of story bound-
aries, and video story segmentation is an essential step
toward providing the means for finding, linking, summa-
rizing, and visualizing related parts of multimedia col-
lections. In many cases, previous story segmentation re-
search has focused on single stream analysis techniques,
utilizing only one of the information sources present in
news broadcasts: natural language, audio, image, and
video (see, for example, (Furht et al., 1995),(Fiscus and
Doddington, 2002),(Greiff et al., 2001), (O’Connor et
al., 2001)). Some segmentation research has included
multimodal approaches that were capable of combin-
ing features from multiple information sources (Boykin
and Merlino, 1999),(Hauptmann and Witbrock, 1998)
. While this work was a significant improvement over
single-stream approaches, they were rarely applied to
non-English sources without closed captioning.
Previous work on story segmentation has identified
many features useful for finding story boundaries, but
feature selection is often model-dependent and does not
account for the differences between broadcast sources.
Specific features useful for video story segmentation vary
widely from one source to the next, and the degree to
which each feature is useful also varies across sources
and even from one broadcast to the next within a sin-
gle source. This variety suggests the need for trainable
techniques in which salient source-specific features can
be automatically learned from a set of training data. This
data-driven approach is especially important in multilin-
gual video processing, where native speakers may not be
available to develop segmentation models for every lan-
guage.
The goal of this paper is to provide a model-
independent investigation of the correlation between a
wide range of multimedia features and news story bound-
aries, in order to aid the development of improved seg-
mentation algorithms. Our work seeks to complement
recent work in model-dependent feature selection, such
as (Hsu and Chang, 2003), without making assumptions
about the dependencies between features.
The feature analysis we describe in this paper consisted
of several steps. First, we created a data set for our exper-
iments by capturing and digitally encoding a set of news
broadcasts from seven video news sources in three lan-
guages. A native speaker manually labelled the story
and commercial boundaries in each broadcast; we de-
scribe the data in Section 2. We ran several state-of-the-
art audio and video analysis software packages on each
recorded broadcasts to extract time-stamped multimedia
metadata, and we defined a set of possible segmentation
features based on the metadata values produced by the
analysis software; we describe the software analysis and
feature extraction in Section 3. Finally, we analyzed the
patterns of occurrence of the features with respect to story
and commercial boundaries in all the news broadcasts;
the results of our analysis are described in Section 4.

2 Data
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999234600000001">
The data for our segmentation research consists of a
set of news broadcasts recorded directly from a satel-
lite dish between September 2002 and February 2003.
The data set contains roughly equal amounts (8-12 hours)
of news broadcasts from seven sources in three lan-
guages: Aljazeera (Arabic), BBC America (UK English),
China Central TV (Mandarin Chinese), CNN Headline
News (US English), CNN International (US/UK En-
glish), Fox News (US English), and Newsworld Interna-
tional (US/UK English).
Each broadcast was manually segmented with the la-
bels “story” and “commercial” by one annotator and ver-
ified by a second, at least one of whom was a native
speaker of the broadcast language. We found that a very
good segmentation is possible by a non-native speaker
based solely on video and acoustic cues, but a native
speaker is required to verify story boundaries that re-
quire language knowledge, such as a single-shot video
sequence of several stories read by a news anchor with-
out pausing. The definition of “story” in our experi-
ments corresponds with the Topic Detection and Track-
ing definition: a segment of a news broadcast with a co-
herent news focus, containing at least two independent,
declarative clauses (LDC, 1999). The segments within
broadcasts briefly summarizing several stories were not
assigned a “story” label, nor were anchor introductions,
signoffs, banter, and teasers for upcoming stories. Each
individual story within blocks of contiguous stories was
labeled “story.” A sequence of contiguous commercials
was annotated with a single “commercial” label with a
single pair of boundaries for the entire block.
Table 1 shows the details of our experimental data set.
The first two columns show the broadcast source and the
language. The next two columns show the total num-
ber of hours and the number of hours labeled “story” for
each source. It is interesting to note that the percentage
of broadcast time devoted to news stories varies widely
by source, from 62% for CNN Headline News to 90% for
CNN International. Similarly, the average story length
varies widely, as shown in the final column of Table 1,
from 52 seconds per story for CNN Headline News to 171
seconds per story for Fox News. These large differences
are extremely important when modeling the distributions
of stories (and commercials) within news broadcasts from
various sources.

sented state-of-the-art technology for a range of audio,

The audio and video analysis produced time-stamped
metadata such as “face Chuck Roberts detected at
time=2:38” and “speaker Bill Clinton identified between
start=12:56 and end=16:28.” From the raw metadata we
created a set of features that have previously been used in
story segmentation work, as well as some novel features
that have not been used in previous published work. The
software components and resulting features are described
in the following sections.

3.1 Audio and language processing
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999978972972973">
A great deal of the information in a news broadcast is
contained in the raw acoustic portion of the news signal.
Much of the information is contained in the spoken audio,
both in the characteristics of the human speech signal and
in the sequence of words spoken. This information can
also take the form of non-spoken audio events, such as
music, background noise, or even periods of silence. We
ran the following audio and language processing compo-
nents on each of the data sources described in Section 2.
Audio type classification segments and labels the au-
dio signal based on a set of acoustic models: speech,
music, breath, lip smack, and silence. Speaker identi-
fication models the speech-specific acoustic characteris-
tics of the audio and seeks to identify speakers from a
library of known speakers. Automatic speech recogni-
tion (ASR) provides an automatic transcript of the spo-
ken words. Topic classification labels segments of the
ASR output according to predefined categories. The au-
dio processing software components listed above are de-
scribed in detail in (Makhoul et al., 2000). Closed cap-
tioning is a human-generated transcript of the spoken
words that is often embedded in a broadcast video sig-
nal.
Story segmentation features automatically extracted
from audio and language processing components were:
speech segment, music segment, breath, lip smack, si-
lence segment, topic classification segment, closed cap-
tioning segment, speaker ID segment, and speaker ID
change. In addition we analyzed the ASR word se-
quences in all broadcasts to automatically derive a set of
source-dependent cue phrase n-gram features. To de-
termine cue n-grams, we extracted all relatively frequent
unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams from the training data
and compared the likelihood of observing each n-gram
near a story boundary vs. elsewhere in the data. Cue
n-gram phrases were deemed to be those that were sig-
nificantly more likely near the start of a story.

3.2 Video and image processing
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999987086956522">
The majority of the bandwidth in a video broadcast sig-
nal is devoted to video content, and this content is a rich
source of information about news stories. The composi-
tion of individual frames of the video can be analyzed to
determine whether specific persons or items are shown,
and the sequence of video frames can be analyzed to de-
termine a pattern of image movement. We ran the fol-
lowing image and video processing components on each
of the data sources described in Section 2.
Face identification detects human faces in the image
and compares the face to a library of known faces. Color
screen detection analyzes the frame to determine if it is
likely to be primarily a single shade, like black or blue.
Logo detection searches the video frame for logos in a
library of known logos. Shot change classification de-
tects several categories of shot changes within a sequence
of video frames.
Story segmentation features automatically extracted
from image and video processing components were: an-
chor face ID, blue screen detection, black screen detec-
tion, logo detection, fast scene cut detection, slow scene
transition detection, gradual scene transient detection,
and scene fade-to-black detection.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998668">
3.3 Feature analysis methodology
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999937818181818">
Each feature in our experiments took the form of a binary
response to a question that related the presence of raw
time-stamped metadata within a window of time around
each story and commercial boundary, e.g., “Did an an-
chor face detection occur within 5 seconds of a story
boundary?” For processing components that produce
metadata with an explicit duration (such as a speaker
ID segment), we defined separate features for the start
and end of the segment plus a feature for whether the
metadata segment “persisted” throughout the time win-
dow around the boundary. For example, a speaker ID
segment that begins at t=12 and ends at t=35 would re-
sult in a true value for the feature “Speaker ID segment
persists,” for a time window of 5 seconds around a story
boundary at t=20.
For each binary feature, we calculated the maximum
likelihood (ML) probability of observing the feature near
a story boundary. For example, if there were 100 sto-
ries, and the anchor face detection feature was true for 50
of the stories, then p(anchorlstory) = 50/100 = 0.5.
We similarly calculated the ML probabilities of an an-
chor face detection near a commercial boundary, outside
of both story and commercial, and inside a story but out-
ide the window of time near the boundary.
Useful features for segmentation in general are those
which occur primarily near only one type of bound-
ary, which would result in a large relative magnitude
difference between these four probabilities. Ideal fea-
tures, f, for story segmentation would be those for which
p(f|story) is much larger than the other values. For our
experiments we identified features for which there was
at least an order of magnitude spread in the observation
probabilities across categories.

4 Results
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999966">
The overarching goal of our analysis was to identify mul-
timedia events for each source that could be used to dis-
tinguish stories from commercials and other non-story
segments in the broadcast. The results of our feature se-
lection experiments revealed several features that were
important for all seven sources we analyzed, as well as
other features that were important for certain sources but
not others. In this section we discuss our results.
Table 2 shows the selected features for each of the
broadcast sources. The first two columns show the name
and type of each feature, as defined in Section 3, with
start, end, and persist for durational metadata features,
where relevant. The cells in the remaining columns show
a “+” if the feature was automatically selected for the cor-
responding source; the cells are empty if the feature was
not selected. The cell contains ”n/a” if the feature was not
available for the source; this was the case for the English-
language TDT topic classification
Of the hundreds of features we analyzed, only 14 were
selected for at least one of the broadcast sources. The
selected features varied greatly by source, with some fea-
tures being used by only one or two of the seven sources.
There are only three features that were selected for each
of the seven sources: music segment persist, video fade
start, and cue n-gram detected. Two other features,
broadcaster logo detected and blue screen detected, were
selected for all but one of the sources. One interesting re-
sult is that these features selected for all or most sources
come from all four information sources: audio, language,
image, and video.
The significance of the selected features also varied by
sources. For example, the blue screen detected feature
was selected for all but one source; this feature thus has
a much higher probability of occurring at certain points

than others. For two sources (ALJ and CNN), the pres-
ence of a blue screen is much more likely to occur during
a commercial. For NWI it is most likely to occur at the
start of a story, and for BBC it is most likely to occur
outside stories and commercials. For CCTV it is equally
likely in commercials and at the start of stories. For none
of the sources is the blue screen likely to occur within a
story.
One of the most important features for all seven
sources is the cue n-gram detected feature derived from
the automatic speech recognition output. Interestingly,
the n-grams that indicate story boundaries were ex-
tremely source-dependent, with almost no overlap in the
lists of words derived across sources. Table 3 shows some
examples of the highest-ranked n-grams from each of the
sources (Arabic and Mandarin n-grams are shown manu-
ally translated into English).

This data-driven approach is especially important in multilingual video processing, where native speakers may not be available to develop segmentation models for every language. The goal of this paper is to provide a modelindependent investigation of the correlation between a wide range of multimedia features and news story boundaries, in order to aid the development of improved segmentation algorithms. Our work seeks to complement recent work in model-dependent feature selection, such as (Hsu and Chang, 2003), without making assumptions about the dependencies between features. The feature analysis we describe in this paper consisted of several steps. First, we created a data set for our experiments by capturing and digitally encoding a set of news broadcasts from seven video news sources in three languages. A native speaker manually labelled the story and commercial boundaries in each broadcast; we describe the data in Section 2. We ran several state-of-theart audio and video analysis software packages on each recorded broadcasts to extract time-stamped multimedia metadata, and we defined a set of</context>

Audio type classification segments and labels the audio signal based on a set of acoustic models: speech, music, breath, lip smack, and silence. Speaker identification models the speech-specific acoustic characteristics of the audio and seeks to identify speakers from a library of known speakers. Automatic speech recognition (ASR) provides an automatic transcript of the spoken words. Topic classification labels segments of the ASR output according to predefined categories. The audio processing software components listed above are described in detail in (Makhoul et al., 2000). Closed captioning is a human-generated transcript of the spoken words that is often embedded in a broadcast video signal. Story segmentation features automatically extracted from audio and language processing components were: speech segment, music segment, breath, lip smack, silence segment, topic classification segment, closed captioning segment, speaker ID segment, and speaker ID change. In addition we analyzed the ASR word sequences in all broadcasts to automatically derive a set of source-dependent cue phrase n-gram features. To determine cue n-grams, we extracted all relatively frequent</context>
