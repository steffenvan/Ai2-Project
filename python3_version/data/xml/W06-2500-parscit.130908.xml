INTRODUCTION

<bodyText confidence="0.999805190476191">
This volume contains the six papers accepted for presentation at Making Sense of
Sense: Bringing Psycholinguistics and Computational Linguistics Together, an EACL 2006
workshop held on April 4, 2006, preceding the 11th Conference of the European Chapter
of the Association for Computational Linguistics.
One of the most critical problems in word disambiguation research is determining the sense
distinctions that are required or meaningful for natural language processing applications.
In recent years, computational linguistics have typically taken a practical approach to
the problem, including the use of pre-defined sense inventories in WordNet and other
lexical resources, exploration of clustering and similar techniques to identify associated
word occurrences that can be regarded as representing a unique sense, and definition of
relevant sense distinctions by examining cross-lingual lexicalization of ambiguous words.
Although research on lexical ambiguity has a long history in the field of psycholinguistics,
work in this area is rarely considered in debates concerned with identifying relevant
sense distinctions for NLP. Recent research in the field of psycholinguistics may offer
significant insight into the sense distinctions that humans readily recognize. In addition,
psycholinguistics research has much to say about the ways in which humans process
ambiguous words and sentences, which can in turn shed some light on computational
approaches to lexical disambiguation.
The goal of this workshop is to bring together computational linguists and psycholinguists
in order to bring the work in each field to bear on the question of sense distinction. The
call for submissions solicited papers on the following topics:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.992871875">
• Lexical ambiguity research in psycholinguistics;
• The relationship of psycholinguistics research to NLP work, and vice versa;
• Sense distinctions in NLP, including overviews of current practice and problems;
• Suggested means to improve sense distinctions used in NLP, including collapsing sense
distinctions in current inventories, use of cross-linguistic information, use of domain
information, etc.;
• Consideration of the viability of and possible means to enhance collaboration between
the psycholinguistics and computational linguistics communities.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999914875">
An introductory presentation by the workshop co-organizers provides an overview of
the problem of sense distinctions for NLP and outlines relevant work in the field of
psycholinguistics. Following presentation of the six accepted papers, a panel discussion
addresses the topics listed above and considers possibilities for collaboration between the
two disciplines. The introductory presentation slides and a panel summary will be available
on the workshop website following the workshop.
We would like to thank our reviewers for doing an excellent and thorough job within the
very short time available to them.
