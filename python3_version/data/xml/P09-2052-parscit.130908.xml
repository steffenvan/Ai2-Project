Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999873888888889">
In this paper, we propose a method for compiling
travel information automatically. For the compi-
lation, we focus on travel blogs, which are de-
fined as travel journals written by bloggers in
diary form. We consider that travel blogs are a
useful information source for obtaining travel
information, because many bloggers&apos; travel expe-
riences are written in this form. Therefore, we
identified travel blogs in a blog database and ex-
tracted travel information from them. We have
confirmed the effectiveness of our method by
experiment. For the identification of travel blogs,
we obtained scores of 38.1% for Recall and
86.7% for Precision. In the extraction of travel
information from travel blogs, we obtained
74.0% for Precision at the top 100 extracted local
products, thereby confirming that travel blogs are
a useful source of travel information.

Travel guidebooks and portal sites provided by
tour companies and governmental tourist boards
are useful sources of information about travel.
However, it is costly and time consuming to
compile travel information for all tourist spots
and to keep them up to date manually. Therefore
we have studied the automatic compilation of
travel information.
For the compilation, we focused on travel

ten by bloggers in diary form. Travel blogs are
considered a useful information source for ob-
taining travel information, because many blog-
gers&apos; travel experiences are written in this form.
Therefore, we identified travel blogs in a blog
database, and extracted travel information from
them.
Travel information in travel blogs is also use-
ful for recommending information that is
matched to the each traveler. Recently, several
methods that identify bloggers&apos; attributes such as
residential area (Yasuda et al., 2006), gender,
and age (Ikeda et al., 2008, Schler et al., 2006),
have been proposed. By combining this research
with travel information extracted from travel
blogs, it is possible to recommend a local prod-
uct that is popular among females, for example,
or a travel spot, where young people often visit.
The remainder of this paper is organized as
follows. Section 2 describes related work. Sec-
tion 3 describes our method. To investigate the
effectiveness of our method, we conducted some
experiments, and Section 4 reports the experi-
mental results. We present some conclusions in
Section 5.

matic identification of travel blogs.
GeoCLEF1 is the cross-language geographic
retrieval track run as part of the Cross Language
Evaluation Forum (CLEF), and has been operat-
ing since 2005 (Gey et al., 2005). The goal of
this task was to retrieve news articles relevant to
particular aspects of geographic information,
such as &apos;wine regions around the rivers in Eu-
rope&apos;. In our work, we focused on travel blogs
instead of news articles, because bloggers&apos; travel
experiences tend to be written in travel blogs.

The task of compiling travel information is di-
vided into two steps: (1) identification of travel
blogs and (2) extraction of travel information
from them. We explain these steps in Sections
3.1 and 3.2.

3.1 Identification of Travel Blogs
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999968413793104">
Blog entries that contain cue phrases, such as
&apos;travel&apos;, &apos;sightseeing&apos;, or &apos;tour&apos;, have a high degree
of probability of being travel blogs. However,
not every travel blog contains such cue phrases.
For example, if a blogger writes his/her journey
to Norway in multiple blog entries, it might state
&apos;We traveled to Norway&apos; in the first entry, while
only writing &apos;We ate wild sheep!&apos; in the second
entry. In this case, because the second entry does
not contain any expressions related to travel, it is
difficult to identify that the second entry is a tra-
vel blog. Therefore, we focus not only on each
entry but also on its surrounding entries for the
identification of travel blogs.
We formulated the identification of travel
blogs as a sequence-labeling problem, and solved
it using machine learning. For the machine learn-
ing method, we examined the Conditional Ran-
dom Fields (CRF) method, whose empirical suc-
cess has been reported recently in the field of
natural language processing. The CRF-based me-
thod identifies the class of each entry. Features
and tags are given in the CRF method as follows:
(1) the k tags occur before a target entry, (2) k
features occur before a target entry, and (3) k
features follow a target entry (see Figure 1). We
used the value of k=4, which was determined in a
pilot study. Here, we used the following features
for machine learning: whether an entry contains

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999922285714286">
We extracted pairs comprising a location name
and a local product from travel blogs, which
were identified in the previous step. For the effi-
cient extraction of travel information, we em-
ployed a bootstrapping method. Firstly, we pre-
pared 482 location-name/and local-product pairs
as seeds for the bootstrapping. These pairs were
obtained automatically from a &apos;Web Japanese N-
gram&apos; database3 provided by Google, Inc. The
database comprises N-grams (N=1-7) extracted
from 20 billion of Japanese sentences on the web.
We applied a pattern &apos;[jt,,t]_,?�tF[_,?�t]i&apos;
([slot of &apos;location name&apos;] local product F[slot of
&apos;local product name&apos;]i) to the database, and ex-
tracted location names and local products from
each corresponding slot, thereby obtaining the
482 pairs.
Secondly, we applied a machine learning-
based information extraction technique to the
travel blogs identified in the previous step, and
obtained new pairs. In this step, we prepared

As a machine learning method, we used the CRF.
In the same way as in the previous step, the
CRF-based method identifies the class of each
word in a given sentence. Features and tags are
given in the CRF method as follows: (1) the k
tags occur before a target word, (2) k features
occur before a target word, and (3) k features
follow a target word. We used the value of k=2,
which was determined in a pilot study. We use
the following six features for machine learning.

<bodyText confidence="0.9367842">
4 In our pilot study, we did not use these negative cas-
es in machine learning at first, and obtained low pre-
cision values, because our system attempted to extract
local products from all sentences containing location
names in travel blogs.
5 In this step, we also identified location names auto-
matically using the CaboCha software.
We randomly selected 4,914 blog entries written
by 317 authors from about 1,100,000 entries
written in Japanese. Then we manually identified
travel blogs in 4,914 entries. As a result, 420 en-
tries were identified as travel blogs. Then we
performed a four-fold cross-validation test. For
the machine-learning package, we used CRF++6
software. For evaluation measures, we used Re-
call and Precision scores.
Alternatives
In order to confirm the validity of our sequence
labeling-based approach, we also examined
another method, which identifies travel blogs
using features in each blog entry only (without
using features in its surrounding entries).
Results and discussions
Table 1 shows the experimental results. As
shown in the table, our method improved the
Precision value by 26.2%, while decreasing the
Recall value by 13.0%. In our research, Precision
is more important than Recall, because low Pre-
cision in this step causes low Precision in the
next step.

Our method could not identify 266 of the tra-
vel blogs. We randomly selected 50 entries from
these 266, and analysed the errors. Among the 50
errors, 25 cases (50%) were caused by the lack of
cue phrases. For the machine learning, we used
manually selected cue phrases. To increase the
number of cue phrases, a statistical approach will
be required. For example, applying n-grams to
automatically identified travel blogs is one such
approach. Among the 50 errors, 5 entries (10%)
were too short (fewer than four sentences) to be
identified by our method.
Our method mistakenly identified 26 entries as
travel blogs. A typical error is that bloggers
wrote non-travel entries among a series of travel
blogs. In this case, the non-travel entries were
identified as travel blogs.

We extracted travel information (locationname/local-product pairs) from each information source, and ranked them by their frequencies. Evaluation We used the Precision value for the top-ranked travel information defined by the following equation as the evaluation measure. We calculated Precision values from the top 5 to the top 100 at intervals of 5. The number of correctly extracted location-name / local-product pairs Precision= The number of extracted location-name / local-product pairs Results and discussions Figure 2 shows the experimental results. As shown in the figure, the generic blo</context>

Travel blogs are considered a useful information source for obtaining travel information, because many bloggers&apos; travel experiences are written in this form. Therefore, we identified travel blogs in a blog database, and extracted travel information from them. Travel information in travel blogs is also useful for recommending information that is matched to the each traveler. Recently, several methods that identify bloggers&apos; attributes such as residential area (Yasuda et al., 2006), gender, and age (Ikeda et al., 2008, Schler et al., 2006), have been proposed. By combining this research with travel information extracted from travel blogs, it is possible to recommend a local product that is popular among females, for example, or a travel spot, where young people often visit. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes related work. Section 3 describes our method. To investigate the effectiveness of our method, we conducted some experiments, and Section 4 reports the experimental results.
