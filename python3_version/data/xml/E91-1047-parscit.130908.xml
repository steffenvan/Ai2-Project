ABSTRACT
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999194625">
In this paper we discuss some problems arising in
German-Russian Machine Translation with regard to tense
and aspect. Since the formal category of aspect is missing
in German the information required for generating Rus-
sian aspect forms has to be extracted from different
representation levels. A sentence based procedure for
aspect choice in the MT system VIRTEX is presented
which takes lexical, morphological and semantic criteria
into account. The limits of this approach are shown. To
overcome these difficulties a human interaction compo-
nent is proposed.
All Slavic languages on the other hand have a well-
formed aspect system where verbs have a perfective and
an imperfective aspect derived from the verbal stem by
affixation. The translation of verbal groups from English
into Russian, for example, seems to be possible by for-
mulating rules which assign concrete Russian aspect
forms to several combinations of tense and aspect in
English, e.g.
has been giving (present perfect continuous)
—&gt; zaBaz (past, imperfective aspect)
has given (present perfect)
--&gt; frail (past, perfective aspect)
(cf. Apresjan 1989: 154).

INTRODUCTION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994472651162791">
Aspect is considered to be a grammatico-semantical
category for expressing various temporal references in
relation to the speech act moment. Regardless of the great
number of special meanings that can be expressed by the
perfective or imperfective aspect (p.asp./i.asp.), there are
two oppositions representing the systematic or basic
aspectual meanings, namely +TOTALITY/ +LIMITEDNESS
versus -TOTALITY/-LIMITEDNESS (see Bondarko 1990).
In this paper we will discuss the transfer of tense and
aspect, a problem which arises immediately in Machine
Translation and differs from language pair to language
pair. This mainly depends on how aspect is expressed in
the particular languages concerned.
It is obvious that aspect in several languages has a
rather heterogeneous formal reflection in the verb system.
Aspect and tense are closely connected with each other.
In English, e.g., the two aspect constructions perfective
and progressive can be seen as realizing the basic contrast
of the action viewed as complete or as incomplete (for
details see van Eynde 1988).
In contrast to the languages mentioned above, aspect
meaning in German, which doubtlessly exists, has no
explicit formal expression. Therefore, aspect information
required for translation into Russian has to be extracted
from different levels of text representation. This is
necessary since without the correct choice of Russian
aspect serious translation errors in the target language
could occur. In our German-Russian MT project VIRTEX
we have approached this problem by constructing a
hierarchic procedure for aspect choice (presented in the
next paragraph), which takes a complex of contextual,
morphological and semantical criteria into account. If the
aspect choice algorithm fails to select one of the two
aspect forms, wider context (beyond the bound-aries of
sentence) or background knowledge must be taken into
consideration. To meet this difficulty VIRTEX is provided
with a system of inquiries. If necessary, human
interaction is entered to make a final decision (in the
sense of Personal MT, see Boitet 1990). A more perfect
solution can only be reached by a more sophisticated text
and knowledge representation including aspectual
characteristics.

A SET OF FORMAL CRITERIA
USED BY V1RTEX
FOR DETERMINING ASPECT AND TENSE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999014166666667">
The MT system VIRTEX is made to translate simple
German main clauses into Russian including the decision
of appropriate aspect forms for simple and complex
verbal groups. We distinguish five different types of
criteria all of them operating on the level of a syntactic
surface structure enriched by semantic features:
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.85522" genericHeader="method">
1. Lexical Information
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995806888888889">
German verbs which in every context denote
non-resultative activities are always translated by a
Russian verb in imperfective aspect form, e.g. arbeiten
&apos;to work&apos; —&gt; pa6oram.
A contrasting class of verbs (siegen &apos;to win&apos;, er-
reichen &apos;to achieve&apos;) which represents achievements (see
Vendler 1967) can be translated in an analogous way into
perfective aspect forms unless the context suggests
iterativity.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.827503" genericHeader="method">
2. Valency Frames
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.694065333333333">
Some verbs allow different readings concerning their
semantics. These may be distinguished by the occurrence
of certain verbal complements:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9906855">
(a) Er schrieb an einem Brief.
&apos;He was writing a letter.&apos;
&gt; OH ITHC8.71 rritcbmo. (i.asp.)
(b) Er schrieb einen Brief.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.96939325">
&apos;He was writing/wrote/has written a letter.&apos;
—&gt; OH rurcaff/Haratcaz ITHCbM0.
(both aspect forms are possible)
Furthermore, there are German verbs which include
several sememes differing with regard to their termina-
tive/aterminative usage (cf. Mehlig 1988). Such a verb is,
e. g., the verb sprechen &apos;to speak&apos;. For translating the
terminative reading of the verb - sprechen mit jmdm. &apos;to
talk with sb.&apos; - in Russian both aspect forms can be
used: roBopHrbirroroBopitm c XM. The atenninative
reading of sprechen does not occur in connection with
the preposition mit &apos;with&apos;. In Russian the imperfective
aspect must be chosen:
Er sprach (vor Studenten) aber Werkstoffe.
&apos;He spoke (to the students) about materials.&apos;
—&gt; OH roaoplui (knoraBoplut) (Hopei
cTyzreHTemH) o maTepieffax.
Such temporal distinctions of verb readings make it to
some extent possible to choose the appropriate aspect
form already with the help of the dictionary only.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.861434" genericHeader="method">
3. Adverbial Semantics
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999094727272727">
Various types of adverbials may help to arrive at a
decision. In cooccurrence with durative, iterative or
intensity adverbials (e.g. den ganzen Tag lang &apos;all day
long&apos;, haufig &apos;frequently&apos;, mehr und mehr &apos;more and
more&apos;), the imperfective aspect is chosen. If there are
adverbials of punctual meaning (pOtzlich &apos;suddenly&apos;,
date, time) or of future events (denuu2chst &apos;soon&apos;) and no
adverbial of the former class, the perfective aspect is
preferred. Within the aspect choice algorithm (see fig. 1)
these two classes of adverbs were named ADV-I and
ADV-P.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.962463" genericHeader="method">
4. Tense
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9802635">
If none of the aforesaid criteria applies some German
tenses determine the aspect choice:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.956102">
- Past perfect is translated to perfective aspect form,
in the case of the present tense (praesens futuri ex-
cluded) the imperfective aspect is preferred.
- Future perfect is translated into future using the
perfective aspect if there is no indicator of subjunc-
tive meaning which is expressed in Russian by the
preterite form an and insertion of Bepognto
&apos;probably&apos;(see the symbol PRT+VEROJATNO in fig.1).
5. Aktionsart Type and Additional Conditions
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999811">
In the case of the remaining tense forms (not listed
In 4.), choice of aspect depends on the verbal semantics.
There are distinctions between durative verbs (warren &apos;to
wait&apos;, diskutieren &apos;to discuss&apos;), verbs with a resultative
meaning (erhöhen &apos;to raise&apos;, definieren &apos;to define&apos;) or
verbs such as auftlihkn &apos;to enumerate&apos;, produzieren &apos;to
produce&apos;, which are characterized by such properties as
limitedness, repeatibifity, general factitive meaning,
named um+rrER in fig. 1 . In these cases the existence of
a direct object, its number and definiteness (N4 KIM,
N4 DET in fig. 1) must be taken into consideration.
For details see figure 1 showing the aspect choice
algorithm for active voice sentences implemented in
VERTEX. Some of the strict decisions in this algorithm are
preferential ones as will be discussed in the next
paragraph. In the case of the passive voice or of modal
constructions, different sequences of conditions are

THE ROLE OF CONTEXT
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999431086956522">
When translating isolated sentences into Russian the
absence of information about how to interpret the verbal
meaning from an aspectual point of view causes major
problems. Often the sentence is too short to find indica-
tors allowing for a decision between several possible
interpretations (cf. Somers 1990) which would lead to
different results of aspect choice. In such cases it is
obvious that by using formal criteria an unambiguous
solution is not possible. In other words: the rigid aspect
choice algorithm implemented in VIRTEX at first com-
pelled us to make preferential decisions although we have
been aware of the fact that sometimes another
interpretation of the sentence to be translated would not
be captured.
In the following we shall show with five examples how
certain contexts help us to clarify the intended interpreta-
tion of the given sentence in order to choose the proper
aspect form. Here the term &apos;context&apos; refers to what is
expressed in the text surrounding the sentence to be
translated or to the user&apos;s background knowledge about
the text. As long as this kind of knowledge is not accessi-
ble, it shall be introduced by means of a dialogue compo-
nent.
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.6850025">
Current l&apos;rocess / Result
(1) Der Student schrieb einen Brief
(la) C77,18HT HEIHHC831 I711CbM0. (p.asp,)
&apos;The student wrote/has written a letter.&apos;
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.99310872">
(lb) CTyAOHT rnicaff ITHCbMO. (i.asp.)
&apos;The student was writing a letter.&apos;
In the first version of VIRTEX designed without a user
dialogue we preferred the interpretation by which the
denoted action is assumed to be completed and conse-
quently the perfective aspect is chosen (see (la)). For
verifying this reading a suitable context criterion could
be, e. g., whether another action follows (sequence of
predicates): &amp;quot;Der Student schrieb einen Brief Danach
brachte er ihn zur Post.&amp;quot; &apos;The student wrote a letter.
After that he took it to the post office.&apos;
Variant (lb) is a good translation if the sentence can be
related to a parallel situation or to an action going on
simultaneously: &amp;quot;Es war spat am Abend. Der Student
schrieb einen Brief &amp;quot; &apos;It was late in the evening. The
student was writing a letter.&apos;
To solve this ambiguity by dialogue the user should be
asked whether a continuous process or a completed action
is meant. This may be done by inserting an adverb into
the sentence and asking the user whether the meaning
remains unchanged. The following question should be
asked: &amp;quot;1st der Satz so gemeint: &apos;Der Student schrieb
gerade einen Brief? OM)&amp;quot; &apos;Does the sentence mean:
The student was jug writing a letter ? (yin)&apos;. If the user
says no, reading (lb) is excluded.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.825091">
Praesens Futuri / Habitual Action
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997884583333333">
Depending on context, German present tense can be
used to express future events. That holds for every kind
of verb. Indicators like adverbs help in recognizing the
future meaning (&amp;quot;Er kommt morgen.&amp;quot; &apos;He will come
tomorrow&apos;). Even if the sentence lacks such adverbs, a
future interpretation may be possible but we neglect this
fact for the time being. Only if the German sentence
contains an achievement verb (the achievement verbs
form a subclass of the non-durative ones), the future
interpretation seems to have a higher probability because
this class of verbs cannot be used to denote a currently
ongoing action:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.8577084">
(2) Er last die Aufgaben rechtzeitig.
(2a) OH peNHT 38.58 1H BO-Bp9MR. (p. asp.)
&apos;He will solve the tasks in time.&apos;
(2b) OHpeilraeT 384.811H BO-BpeMH. (i.asp.)
&apos;He solves the tasks in time.&apos;
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9865104">
An indicator for the praesens futuri interpretation
leading to the translation (2a) would be a context like
&amp;quot;Morgen muff der Student die Arbeit abgeben. lch bin
sicher: Er last die Aufgaben rechtzeitig.&amp;quot; &apos;Tomorrow the
student has to submit the paper. I am sure: he will solve
the tasks in time.&apos; In this case the perfective aspect is
necessary. But it is also possible to assign the sentence an
iterative/habitual interpretation leading to sentence (2b).
Then we have in mind rather a certain property than a
concrete action of the person specified in the subject
position. A context suggesting this reading could be a
characterization of the student.
- 272 -
To test whether this reading is meant the user is invited
to compare the original sentence with &amp;quot;Er last die
Aufgaben in der ReRel rechtzeitig.&amp;quot; &apos;As a rule he solves
the tasks in time.&apos; If the insertion is possible without
changing the sentence meaning, the imperfective aspect
of the verb will be chosen, otherwise we assume that the
future interpretation holds, which is expressed by the
perfective aspect.
Type / Token
Another class of verbs (such as herstellen &apos;to produce&apos;,
exportieren &apos;to export&apos;, verkaufen &apos;to sell&apos;) causes a type
of ambiguity as shown in (3):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.8548088">
(3) Der Trabant wurde in der DDR verkauil.
(3a) Tpa6a,Frr 6hrff npozraH B 17(P. (p.asp.)
&apos;The Trabant car was sold in the GDR.&apos;
(3b) Tpa68HT rrpoiretBancii B TOP. (i.asp.)
&apos;The Trabant car was sold in the GDR.&apos;
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.97482925">
In a context like &amp;quot;Aul3erhalb des Landes stie$ der
Trabant auf Absatzschwierigkeiten.&amp;quot; &apos;Abroad the Trabant
car met with sales resistance.&apos; sentence (3) describes a
frequentative process. In another context a single event of
verkaufen &apos;to sell&apos; could be meant: &amp;quot;Die Polizei befaOt
sich noch immer mit dein Unfallauto. Es is: jetzt sicher:
Der Trabant wurde in der DDR verlcauft.&amp;quot; &apos;The police is
still investigating the car damaged in the accident. Now
it is clear: the Trabant car was sold in the GDR.&apos;
You may observe in our example that the aspectual
ambiguity is interrelated with an ambiguity of the
semantic object: whereas in the first reading it refers to
a set of objects, Trabant is type, in the second reading
it denotes one concrete individual - Trabant is token. The
distinction between type and token requires deeper
semantic analysis which is impossible without contextual
knowledge.
In order to avoid the terms &apos;type&apos; and &apos;token&apos; within
the dialogue, two sentences are offered to the user. He
must decide which of them is more suitable to be used as
a paraphrase of the original sentence. With our example,
he must select between &amp;quot;Dieses Objekt wurde in der DDR
verkaujr &apos;This object was sold in the GDR&apos; and &amp;quot;Die
Ob&apos;ekte wurden in der DDR verkaur &apos;The objects were
sold in the GDR&apos;. If the user prefers the first paraphrase,
the Russian perfective aspect will be used, otherwise the
imperfective one.
General Factitive Meaning / Concrete Action
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.6724296">
(4) Er hat Plane ausgearbeitet.
(4a) OH pa3pthaThmaz Him Hb1. (i.asp.)
&apos;He has worked out plans.&apos;
(4b) OH pa3pa6oTaz rualat. (p.asp.)
&apos;He has worked out plans.&apos;
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999802961538461">
The imperfective meaning (see (4a)) is inherent in the
source sentence when it is interpreted in the following
way: a person has gained some experience in working out
plans, maybe it was his professional task. Such a
translation underlines the general factitive meaning which
can be emphasized by using the adverbials irgendwann
einmal, eine Zeiilang &apos;some time (during his life)&apos;: &amp;quot;Er
hat irRendwann einmal / eine Zeitlang Plane ausgearbei-
let.&amp;quot; &apos;Some time he worked out plans.&apos; This is the
preferred reading in the VIRTEX aspect choice algorithm.
Nevertheless, the sentence also can suggest a concrete,
completed action, e. g., if the context refers to the result
of this action as in &amp;quot;Er hat Plane ausgearbeitet. Sie
liegen zur Ansicht aus.&amp;quot; &apos;He has elaborated plans. They
are open to inspection.&apos; In this case the translation must
use the perfective aspect.
To test which of the two readings is the appropriate
one, the system offers a sentence with the inserted
adverbs as mentioned above, and the user is requested to
compare its meaning with that of the sentence to be
translated.
The preference of (4a) to (4b) assumed by VIRTIDC
would be the converse if the direct object were definite.
Further types of aspectual ambiguity may occur. In
addition, within one aspect form it may become necessary
to resolve temporal ambiguities, e.g.:
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.8478924">
Future Perfect / Subjunctive Meaning
(5) Der Student wird die Prafung abgelegt haben.
(5a) CTyAOHT czacT 31C38MeH.
&apos;The student will have passed the exam.&apos;
(5b) CTyAPHT, BepORTHO, CA ii 3K3814PH.
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.924169666666667">
&apos;The student probably passed the exam.&apos;
Sentences (5a) and (5b) exemplify that future perfect in
German does not only express future events but more
often expresses a presumption with regard to events, ac-
tions, etc. which took place in the past. The latter
interpretation could be indicated by adverbs which
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.907038">
7 273
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.99986847826087">
semantically contradict the future interpretation. These
are adverbs of anteriority denoting spans or points of tune
in the past such as gestern &apos;yesterday&apos;, eben / gerade
&apos;just&apos; or letztes Jahr &apos;last year&apos;. In this case the choice
of the proper aspect form depends on the semantic
subclass of the associated verb. For non-durative verbs
the perfective aspect must be chosen, for durative verbs
- the imperfective one. On the other hand, adverbs of
posteriority underline the future tense interpretation.
Without such adverbials the sentence remains ambiguous.
Adverbs of simultaneity and those deictic adverbs which
can express simultaneity as well as anteriority and
posteriority do not contribute to disambiguating future
perfect sentences because they allow for both interpreta-
tions.
To solve the ambiguity in example (5) the inquiry
might be: &amp;quot;Nehmen Sie an, da/3 das bereits erfolgt is:?&amp;quot;
&apos;Do you think that it already happened?&apos;
When formulating the inquiries of the dialogue compo-
nent, we followed the principle that the questions to be
answered by the user should be made as precise and
simple as possible and should not presuppose any special
knowledge in linguistics.

CONCLUSIONS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999969058823529">
The above examples show the necessity of taking wider
context into account if the sentences are too short to
make a wellfounded choice of aspect and tense. As a
preliminary solution the integration of inquiries into the
system was proposed. For practical use such inquiries
may be very helpful because they allow us to improve the
translation of isolated sentences and, moreover, of senten-
ces taken from texts. Nevertheless, from the linguistic
point of view there has to be further investigation in the
field of semantics for the automatic generation of the
appropriate aspect forms.
In future we plan to treat aspect and tense by express-
ing them in a deep semantic representation. This forces
us to include wider context beyond sentence boundaries
or extralinguistic knowledge, e.g. style and text typology.
This can be done either in an interactive way as proposed
in this paper or by means of knowledge based MT.

If the aspect choice algorithm fails to select one of the two aspect forms, wider context (beyond the bound-aries of sentence) or background knowledge must be taken into consideration. To meet this difficulty VIRTEX is provided with a system of inquiries. If necessary, human interaction is entered to make a final decision (in the sense of Personal MT, see Boitet 1990). A more perfect solution can only be reached by a more sophisticated text and knowledge representation including aspectual characteristics. - 269 - A SET OF FORMAL CRITERIA USED BY V1RTEX FOR DETERMINING ASPECT AND TENSE The MT system VIRTEX is made to translate simple German main clauses into Russian including the decision of appropriate aspect forms for simple and complex verbal groups. We distinguish five different types of criteria all of them operating on the level of a syntactic surface structure enriched by semantic features: 1.

Apresjan 1989: 154). INTRODUCTION Aspect is considered to be a grammatico-semantical category for expressing various temporal references in relation to the speech act moment. Regardless of the great number of special meanings that can be expressed by the perfective or imperfective aspect (p.asp./i.asp.), there are two oppositions representing the systematic or basic aspectual meanings, namely +TOTALITY/ +LIMITEDNESS versus -TOTALITY/-LIMITEDNESS (see Bondarko 1990). In this paper we will discuss the transfer of tense and aspect, a problem which arises immediately in Machine Translation and differs from language pair to language pair. This mainly depends on how aspect is expressed in the particular languages concerned. It is obvious that aspect in several languages has a rather heterogeneous formal reflection in the verb system. Aspect and tense are closely connected with each other. In English, e.g., the two aspect constructions perfective and progressive can be seen as realizing the basic contrast of the action viewed as complete or as incomplete (for </context>

For translating the terminative reading of the verb - sprechen mit jmdm. &apos;to talk with sb.&apos; - in Russian both aspect forms can be used: roBopHrbirroroBopitm c XM. The atenninative reading of sprechen does not occur in connection with the preposition mit &apos;with&apos;.

The VIRTEX aspect choice algorithm for active voice -271- checked in combination with the operations of passive to active transformation (if necessary) or structural transfer for certain modal constructions. THE ROLE OF CONTEXT When translating isolated sentences into Russian the absence of information about how to interpret the verbal meaning from an aspectual point of view causes major problems. Often the sentence is too short to find indicators allowing for a decision between several possible interpretations (cf. Somers 1990) which would lead to different results of aspect choice. In such cases it is obvious that by using formal criteria an unambiguous solution is not possible. In other words: the rigid aspect choice algorithm implemented in VIRTEX at first compelled us to make preferential decisions although we have been aware of the fact that sometimes another interpretation of the sentence to be translated would not be captured. In the following we shall show with five examples how certain contexts help us to clarify the intended interpretation of the given sentence in order to choose the proper aspect form. He</context>
