Guidelines for Submissions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998141259259259">
Manuscripts submitted to the American Journal of Computational Linguistics
should be typed on 8-1/2 by 11-inch paper, double-spaced throughout, including
footnotes and references. The paper should begin with an abstract of approximately
100 words. The language in which the manuscript is written must be English.
Footnotes should be numbered consecutively. Whenever it does not materially
impede the logic and readability of the paper, footnote material should be included in
the text. References should be listed alphabetically by author at the end of the
paper. The exact style of the references and their callouts in the text are not fixed,
but should conform to some accepted standard.
The length of papers submitted for publication in the AJCL is determined by
author requirements. However, our objective is to insure that as many worthy papers
as possible will appear in each issue. Therefore, we would prefer that papers do not
exceed 10 Journal pages in length. (This is the equivalent of approximately 40
double-spaced typewritten pages.)
Each paper submitted is fully refereed, being read by at least two members of the
Editorial Board and usually by an additional expert in the particular subject area.
Upon request to the Editor, an author&apos;s identity may be withheld from the referees.
The submission of a paper to the AJCL for refereeing means that the author
certifies the manuscript is not copyrighted; nor has it been published or accepted for
publication by any refereed journal; nor is it being refereed elsewhere. If any version
of the paper has appeared, or will appear, in a non-refereed publication, the details
of such publication must be made known to the Editor at the time of submission.
The final version of a paper tentatively accepted for publication must be accom-
panied by a Copyright Transfer Agreement signed by at least one of the authors (who
agrees to inform the others, if any) or, in the case of a &amp;quot;work made for hire,&amp;quot; by the
employer. The form for copyright transfer will be sent to the responsible author, who
must return it signed to the Editor before the paper will be finally accepted. This
written transfer of copyright is necessary under the 1978 U. S. Copyright Law.
Preferably, the final version of an accepted paper will be submitted in machine-
readable form, such as a file on magnetic tape. Authors will be given instructions as
to how to prepare such a file. In general, notation should be selected so as to
simplify the phototypesetting process. Also, figures should be devised with consid-
eration for whether they would require one column or two columns in the final
Journal form. Any drawing required is the author&apos;s responsibility. After publication,
fifty free reprints of an article are provided to the authors.
Five copies of manuscripts should be sent to the Editor:
George E. Heidorn
IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center
P.O. Box 218
Yorktown Heights, New York 10598
(914) 945-2776
Contributions of other types of material are sought, also, such as copies of
technical reports and papers for abstracting purposes, review copies of books,
advance announcements of meetings, personal notes (such as honors and job
changes), letters to the editor, and short technical notes. All items should be sent to
the Editor at the address given above.
A Note from the Editor:
With the publication of this issue of the AJCL, I am resigning as Editor in
order to devote more time to my research. While a long-term replacement is
being sought, Stan Petrick and Fred Damerau will co-edit some 1982 issues.
Michael McCord will continue as Associate Editor, and I will continue to do
the Finite String Newsletter portion of the Journal.
News, announcements and abstracts can still be sent to me, but all future
correspondence on technical articles should be addressed to:

In the three years that I have been Editor, after missing publication entirely
in 1979 due to difficulties of converting to a hard-copy journal, we published
seven issues for 1980 and 1981, totaling 486 hard-copy pages (plus 45 pages
of Microfiche Supplement). Included in these issues are 21 technical articles,
16 book reviews, 366 abstracts, two complete membership lists, technical
correspondence, announcements, and minutes and programs of meetings.
During this time we received 76 manuscripts. In addition to the 21 that
have been published, 31 were rejected or withdrawn, two are being revised,
and 22 are being reviewed. While submissions had just about stopped under
the old microfiche-only form of the Journal, the rate and quality of submis-
sions are now quite good. Also during this time, the size of our membership
has more than doubled, going from 662 in 1978 to 1447 in 1981. At the same
time, our dues have remained constant, and the financial assets of the Associa-
tion have increased substantially each year. (The details of these latter points
may be found in the Attachments to the 1981 Minutes on page 262 of this
issue.)
I would like to take this opportunity to thank everybody who has given me
help and support during my term as Editor. In particular, I would like to
thank Michael McCord, Don Walker, Lance Miller, Karen Jensen, Robin Neff,
Andrea McKenzie, Cay Dietrich, the members of the Editorial Board and
other referees, the officers of the ACL, and, of course, the authors.
