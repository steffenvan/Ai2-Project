gency dispatcher, cooperating with the system to
dynamically allocate resources to and make
plans for solving problems as they arise in the
world. The setting, Monroe County, NY, is con-
siderably more complex than our previous do-
mains (e.g. Pacifica, TRAINS), and raises new
issues in knowledge representation and refer-
ence. Emergencies include requests for medical
assistance, car accidents, civil disorder, and
larger problems such as flooding and snow
storms. Resources at the user&apos;s disposal may
include road crews, electric crews, ambulances,
police units and helicopters. Some of the in-
crease in. mixed-initiative interaction comes
from giving the system more knowledge of the
tasks being solved. Some comes from the fact
that the solution to one problem may conflict
with the solution to another, either because of
scheduling conflicts, scarce resources, or aspects
of the physical world (e.g. an ambulance can&apos;t go
down a road that has not been plowed). The
range of tasks and complexity of the world allow
for problem solving at different levels of granu-
larity, making it possible for the system to take
as much control over the task as the user per-
mits.

While a number of robust dialogue systems have
been built in recent years, they mostly have op-
erated in domains that require little if any rea-
soning. Rather, the task is hard-coded into the
system operation. One of the major goals of the
TRIPS project has been to develop dialogue
models and system architectures that support
conversational interaction in domains where
complex reasoning systems are required. One
goal has been to build a fairly generic model in
which different domains can then be specified
fairly easily. On this front, we are seeing some
success as we have now constructed versions of
TRIPS in three different domains, and TRIPS-
911 will be the fourth. In developing the system
for new domains, the bulk of the work by far has
been in system enhancements rather than in
developing the domain models.
The TRIPS-911 domain has forced a rethinking
of the relationship between dialogue-
management, problem-solving, the system&apos;s

own goal-pursuit and generation. The new ar-
chitecture is designed to support research into
mixed-initiative interactions, incremental gen-
eration of content (in which the user might in-
tervene before the system completes all it has to
say), rich reference resolution models, and the
introduction of plan monitoring and plan repair
into the suite of plan management operations
supported. The domain also can support longer
and richer dialogues than in previous domains.
More complex domains mean even more com-
plex dialogues. The complexity arises from
many factors. First, more complex dialogues
will involve topic progression, development and
resumption, and more complex referential phe-
nomena. On the problem solving front, there will
be more complex corrections, elaborations and
modifications—forcing us to develop richer
discourse models. In addition, the complexity of
the domain demonstrates a need for better
grounding behavior and a need for incremental
dialogue-based generation.
We have by no means solved these problems.
Rather we have built a rich testbed, designed and
implemented a plausible architecture, and have
constructed an initial system to demonstrate
basic capabilities in each of the problem areas.

TRIPS-911 is a first attempt at handling a do-
main of this complexity. As such there are many
capabilities that people have in such situations
that are beyond the system&apos;s current capabilities.
Some of the most important are:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999207736842105">
• Scale — we can only handle small domains
and the existing techniques would not ex-
tend directly to a realistic size 911 operation.
To scale up we must face some difficult
problems including reasoning about quanti-
ties and aggregates, planning in large-scale
domains (i.e., the real domains are beyond
the capalbilities. of current plan technology),
and performing intention recognition as the
number of options increases. In addition, for
an effective dialogue system, all this must be
done in real-time.
• Meta-talk — when faced with complex prob-
lems, people often first generally discuss the
problem and possible strategies for solving
it, and later may explicitly direct attention to
specific subproblems. The current TRIPS
system does not support such discussion.
• Time — in the 911 domain there are at least

two temporal contexts that can be &amp;quot;used&amp;quot; by
the conversants: there is the actual time (i.e.,
when they are talking), but there also is the
time relative to a point of focus in a plan, or
even simply talking about the past or the
future. TRIPS-911 can currently interpret
expressions with respect to the actual time.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.982966090909091">
• Interleaved generation — when people are
discussing complex issues, they often have
to plan to communicate their content across
several different utterances. There is no
guarantee that the other conversant will not
&amp;quot;interrupt&amp;quot; (e.g., to clarify, correct, suggest
alternatives, etc) before the entire content is
conveyed. This requires a rethinking of cur-
rent practice in generation to make it incre-
mental and interactive.

system while it is talking. It is unclear at this
stage what the system should assume was
conveyed. The strategies of assuming noth-
ing was conveyed, or that all was conveyed
have obvious faults. We are pursuing alter-
natives based on knowing when speech was
interrupted, but using this information suc-
cessfully remains a difficult problem.
