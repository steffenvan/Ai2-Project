PREFACE
</note>
<bodyText confidence="0.99981252">
These proceedings contain both the papers that were contributed to the 20th annual meeting
of the Association for Computational Linguistics and the position papers from the invited panelists.
It has become traditional for the ACL meeting to present material all along the spectrum of applied
and theoretical work; this meeting is no exception. The topic mew include computational semantics,
knowledge representation, data base interfaces, language generation, acquisition of syntactic rules,
and the understanding of ungrammatical (or otherwise non-standard) input. This great breadth
illustrates how much the field has grown in the two decades of ACL&apos;s existence.
To celebrate the beginning of our third decade, this year&apos;s program includes a panel composed
of past presidents of the ACL; it is hoped that their reflections will provide a perspective from which
the future can be viewed realistically but with optimism. Two other panels touch upon one of the
current &amp;quot;hot topics&amp;quot; in computational linguistics (natural language interfaces to data bases) and
one of the areas we anticipate will become &amp;quot;hot&amp;quot; in the very near future (non-normative systems).
The panel chairmen, Don Walker, Bob Moore, and Mitch Marcus, are to be commended on their
selection of panelists and on their formulation of the issues the panelists will address.
The Program Committee consisted of Madeleine Bates (Bolt Beranek and Newman), Jonathan
Allen (MIT), Robert Berwick (MIT), Barbara Grosz (SRI International), Chris Riesbeck (Yale), and
Stuart Shapiro (SUN)&apos; Buffalo). The committee evaluated 43 papers that were submitted to the
conference. The selection of a final program is always a difficult process, but we believe that this
year&apos;s program continues the ACL&apos;s tradition of excellence. Special thanks go to all those who
submitted papers to the conference.
The continuing success of our meetings is due to the effort of numerous volunteers who accept
responsibilities and discharge then with good will. In particular, this year, Ray Perrault managed
the local arrangements for the meeting, Don Walker saw to it that the call for papers, the program
announcement, and the proceedings all got produced and distributed (no small task!), and Jane
Robinson kept everything under control.
