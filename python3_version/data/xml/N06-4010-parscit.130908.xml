The approach to factoid question answering (QA)
that we adopt was first described in (Whittaker et
al., 2005b) where the details of the mathematical
model and how it was trained for English were
given. The approach has been successfully evalu-
ated in the 2005 text retrieval conference (TREC)
question answering track evaluations (Voorhees and
Trang Dang, 2005) where our group placed eleventh
out of thirty participants (Whittaker et al., 2005a).
Although the TREC QA task is substantially differ-
ent to web-based QA this evaluation showed that our
approach works and provides an objective assess-
ment of its quality. Similarly, for our Japanese lan-
guage system we have evaluated the performance of
our approach on the NTCIR-3 QAC-1 task (Whit-
taker et al., 2005c). Although our Japanese ex-
periments were applied retrospectively, the results
would have placed us in the mid-range of partici-
pating systems. In (Whittaker et al., 2006b) we de-
scribed how our approach could be used for the rapid
development of web-based QA systems in five very
different languages. It was shown that a developer
proficient with the tools, and with access to suitable
training data, could build a system in a new language
in around 10 hours. In (Whittaker et al., 2006a) we
evaluated the performance of the systems for four of
our five languages. We give a brief summary of our
approach to QA in Section 2.
In this paper we introduce our web-based
QA system which is publicly accessible at
http://asked.jp, permitting questions in En-
glish, Japanese, Chinese, Russian and Swedish and

<bodyText confidence="0.999527709677419">
In this paper we describe the web and
mobile-phone interfaces to our multi-
language factoid question answering (QA)
system together with a prototype speech
interface to our English-language QA sys-
tem. Using a statistical, data-driven ap-
proach to factoid question answering has
allowed us to develop QA systems in five
languages in a matter of months. In the
web-based system, which is accessible
at http://asked.jp, we have com-
bined the QA system output with standard
search-engine-like results by integrating it
with an open-source web search engine.
The prototype speech interface is based
around a VoiceXML application running
on the Voxeo developer platform. Recog-
nition of the user’s question is performed
on a separate speech recognition server
dedicated to recognizing questions. An
adapted version of the Sphinx-4 recog-
nizer is used for this purpose. Once the
question has been recognized correctly it
is passed to the QA system and the re-
sulting answers read back to the user by
speech synthesis. Our approach is mod-
ular and makes extensive use of open-
source software. Consequently, each com-
ponent can be easily and independently
improved and easily extended to other lan-
guages.

is discussed in Section 3. Since answers in factoid
QA are inherently well-suited to display on small
screens we have also made a mobile-phone interface
which is accessible at the same address when using
an HTML browser from a mobile phone. This is dis-
cussed in Section 4. There are several other QA sys-
tems on the web including Brainboost (Brainboost,
2005) and Lexxe (Lexxe, 2005) but they only try to
answer questions in English and do not have conve-
nient mobile interfaces.
Entering whole questions rather than just key-
words is tedious especially on a mobile-phone so
we have also begun to look at speech interfaces. In
this paper we describe a prototype speech interface
to our English-language QA system. This prototype
is currently intended primarily as a platform for fur-
ther research into speech recognition and answering
of questions from an acoustic modelling point-of-
view (e.g. low-bandwidth, low-quality VoIP chan-
nel), from a language modelling perspective (e.g. ir-
regular word order in questions vs. text, and very
large out-of-vocabulary problem) and also in terms
of dialog modelling. There have been several at-
tempts at speech interfaces to QA systems in the lit-
erature e.g. (Schofield and Zheng, 2003) but as far
as we know ours is the only system that is publicly
accessible. We discuss this interface in Section 5.

The answer to a question depends primarily on the
question itself but also on many other factors such
as the person asking the question, the location of the
person, what questions the person has asked before,
and so on. For simplicity, we choose to consider
only the dependence of an answer on the question
. In particular, we hypothesize that the answer
depends on two sets of features extracted from :
and as follows:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.897514">
(1)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.99901428125">
where can be thought of as a set of features
describing the “question-type” part of such as
who, when, where, which, etc. and is a set of fea-
tures comprising the “information-bearing” part of
i.e. what the question is actually about and what
it refers to. For example, in the questions, Where
is Mount Everest? and How high is Mount Ever-
est? the information-bearing component is identical
in both cases whereas the question-type component
is different.
Finding the best answer involves a search over
all for the one which maximizes the probability of
the above model:
This is guaranteed to give us the optimal answer
in a maximum likelihood sense if the probability dis-
tribution is the correct one. Making various condi-
tional independence assumptions to simplify mod-
elling we obtain the final optimisation criterion:
The model is essentially a language
model which models the probability of an answer
sequence given a set of information-bearing fea-
tures . It models the proximity of to features in
. This model is referred to as the retrieval model.
The model matches an answer with
features in the question-type set . Roughly speak-
ing this model relates ways of asking a question with
classes of valid answers. For example, it associates
names of people or companies with who-type ques-
tions. In general, there are many valid and equiprob-
able for a given so this component can only
re-rank candidate answers retrieved by the retrieval
model. Consequently, we call it the filter model.

<bodyText confidence="0.999961090909091">
The web-based interface to our QA systems has been
accessible at http://asked.jp since Decem-
ber 2005 and although still primarily a research sys-
tem and not widely advertised it attracts around five
unique users a day. Currently we do not perform
language detection for an input question so the user
must first select a language-specific system before
inputting a question in a language other than En-
glish.
In Figure 1 we show the results page for the ques-
tion “How high is Mount Everest?”. As can be seen
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.9999115">
the left-hand side of the page contains the familiar
title, link and summaries of pages relevant to the
query that is common to most of today’s web search
engines. These results are produced by an open-
source web search engine which is run locally and
currently contains about 100 million web-pages in
its database. Down the right-hand side of the results
page we present the answers that were found by our
QA system. These answers are presented in order
of probability as determined by Equation (3). When
the mouse is rolled over an answer a Java-script pop-
up box is displayed that shows more context for a
given answer. This allows the user to determine
more rapidly the validity of an answer and also par-
tially compensates for inaccurate answer identifica-
tion by the system. Each answer can also be clicked
on whereupon the user is redirected to the page from
which the answer was taken. This re-direction is ef-
fected through a redirect via our own web-server so
that for a given question we can see which answers
were clicked on. Eventually, it is hoped this could
be used for unsupervised system adaptation.

The same basic layout and design is repeated for
each of the five language-specific systems. In Fig-
ure 2 we show the results page for the Japanese ques-
tion of “What plant do Pandas eat?”.
The average response time to present the full re-
sults page for a question in each language is cur-
rently around 10 seconds. The web-search and QA
systems are run in parallel and the outputs combined
when both are complete.

4 Mobile-phone interface
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999961416666667">
Since the priorities with a mobile-phone interface re-
volve around speed, display size and cost to the user,
the interface is basically a whittled down version of
the web-based interface described in the previous
section. The only requirement for being able to use
the mobile phone interface is that the phone must
contain an HTML browser. In countries like Japan
this has been fairly standard for many years but it is
expected that this will become more common world-
wide in the near future with the continued roll-out of
3G mobile phone services.
For the mobile-phone interface the standard web-
search results section has been removed entirely
from the results section and instead only the top 20
short answers are displayed without pop-up boxes
or corresponding context. Such a strategy mini-
mizes the number of bytes transmitted and ensures
that most answers are adequately displayed on most
mobile-phone interfaces with a minimum amount of
scrolling. Although not yet implemented we aim to
allow users to click on an answer and be taken to
the part of the page that contains the answer rather
than loading a whole page which could sometimes
be several megabytes in size.

ability of the Voxeo developer platform&apos; which
provides free access, for development purposes,
to a VoiceXML browser running our application.
The application can be accessed through: (i)
a U.S. telephone number at (800) 289-5570
then PIN:9991423955; (ii) SIP VoIP clients
at (SIP:9991423955sip.voxeo.net); (iii)
Free World Dialup at (**86919991423955); and
(iv)SkypeOutat(+99000936 9991423955).
Since most VoiceXML applications are designed
for use with small vocabulary, rule-based gram-
mars we only use VoiceXML and Voxeo’s browser
to handle negotiation of the questions and answers
with the user through simple dialogs. The recog-
nition of the question itself is performed using a
dedicated large-vocabulary speech recognizer with a
language model (LM) trained on English-language
questions. The speech recognizer we use is the
open-source Sphinx-4 recognizer (Walker et al.,
2004) which runs in a server mode and has been
adapted to use more complex LMs than those per-
mitted by the default ARPA format word -gram
LMs. Currently we use a linear interpolation of
a word and class-based trigram LM each of which
were trained on a large corpus of English-language
questions (Hallmarks, 2002)—the same data used to
train the English-language QA system (Whittaker et
al., 2005b).

Having recapped a basic overview of our statistical
approach to question answering (QA), in this paper
we have described the web and mobile-phone in-
terfaces to our multi-language QA system and how
they can be accessed. In addition, we have de-
scribed our first attempt at a prototype speech in-
terface which will be used as a platform for future
research. Eventually our aim is to make the QA per-
formance of the speech interface the same as that
obtained through the web and mobile-phone inter-
faces. This will be achieved through a combination
of acoustic, language and dialog model adaptation
on the speech side, and making the QA system more
robust to underspecified and errorful questions on
the QA side. We think these demonstration systems

Similarly, for our Japanese language system we have evaluated the performance of our approach on the NTCIR-3 QAC-1 task (Whittaker et al., 2005c).

The approach has been successfully evaluated in the 2005 text retrieval conference (TREC) question answering track evaluations (Voorhees and Trang Dang, 2005) where our group placed eleventh out of thirty participants (Whittaker et al., 2005a). Although the TREC QA task is substantially different to web-based QA this evaluation showed that our approach works and provides an objective assessment of its quality. Similarly, for our Japanese language system we have evaluated the performance of our approach on the NTCIR-3 QAC-1 task (Whittaker et al., 2005c). Although our Japanese experiments were applied retrospectively, the results would have placed us in the mid-range of participating systems.

The speech recognizer we use is the open-source Sphinx-4 recognizer (Walker et al., 2004) which runs in a server mode and has been adapted to use more complex LMs than those permitted by the default ARPA format word -gram LMs. Currently we use a linear interpolation of a word and class-based trigram LM each of which were trained on a large corpus of English-language questions (Hallmarks, 2002)—the same data used to train the English-language QA system (Whittaker et al., 2005b). 6 Conclusion and Further work Having recapped a basic overview of our statistical approach to question answering (QA), in this paper we have described the web and mobile-phone interfaces to our multi-language QA system and how they can be accessed. In addition, we have described our first attempt at a prototype speech interface which will be used as a platform for future research.
