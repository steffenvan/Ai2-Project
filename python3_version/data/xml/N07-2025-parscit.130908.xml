<bodyText confidence="0.999907611111111">
This paper proposes a ternary relation
extraction method primarily based on
rich syntactic information. We identify
PROTEIN-ORGANISM-LOCATION re-
lations in the text of biomedical articles.
Different kernel functions are used with
an SVM learner to integrate two sources
of information from syntactic parse trees:
(i) a large number of syntactic features
that have been shown useful for Seman-
tic Role Labeling (SRL) and applied here
to the relation extraction task, and (ii) fea-
tures from the entire parse tree using a
tree kernel. Our experiments show that the
use of rich syntactic features significantly
outperforms shallow word-based features.
The best accuracy is obtained by combin-
ing SRL features with tree kernels.

Biomedical functional relations (relations for short)
state interactions among biomedical substances. For
instance, the PROTEIN-ORGANISM-LOCATION
(POL) relation that we study in this paper provides
information about where a PROTEIN is located in
an ORGANISM, giving a valuable clue to the bi-
ological function of the PROTEIN and helping to
identify suitable drug, vaccine and diagnostic tar-
gets. Fig. 1 illustrates possible locations of proteins
in Gram+ and Gram− bacteria. Previous work in
biomedical relation extraction task (Sekimizu et al.,
1998; Blaschke et al., 1999; Feldman et al., 2002)
suggested the use of predicate-argument structure by
taking verbs as the center of the relation – in con-
trast, in this paper we directly link protein named en-
tities (NEs) to their locations; in other related work,
(Claudio et al., 2006) proposed an approach that

solely considers the shallow semantic features ex-
tracted from sentences.
For relation extraction in the newswire domain,
syntactic features have been used in a generative
model (Miller et al., 2000) and in a discriminative
log-linear model (Kambhatla, 2004). In comparison,
we use a much larger set of syntactic features ex-
tracted from parse trees, many of which have been
shown useful in SRL task. Kernel-based methods
have also been used for relation extraction (Zelenko
et al., 2003; Culotta and Sorensen, 2004; Bunescu
and Mooney, 2005) on various syntactic represen-
tations, such as dependency trees or constituency-
based parse trees. In contrast, we explore a much
wider variety of syntactic features in this work. To
benefit from both views, a composite kernel (Zhang
et al., 2006) integrates the flat features from enti-
ties and structured features from parse trees. In our
work, we also combine a linear kernel with a tree
kernel for improved performance.

zyme S” is a PROTEIN name, “extracellular” a LO-
CATION name and “Pseudomonas aeruginosa” an
ORGANISM name. Our task is to identify if there
exists a ”PROTEIN-ORGANISM-LOCATION” re-
lation among these three NEs.

ternary relation extraction problem into two binary
relation extraction problems. Specifically, we split
the POL ternary relation into binary relations as: (1)
PO: PROTEIN and ORGANISM, and (2) PL: PRO-
TEIN and LOCATION.
The ORGANISM-LOCATION relation is ignored
because it does not consider the PROTEIN and is
less meaningful than the PO and PL relations. Based
on this simplification, and following the idea of
SRL, we take the PROTEIN name in the role of the
predicate (verb) and the ORGANISM/LOCATION
name as its argument candidates in question. Then
the problem of identifying the binary relations of PO
and PL has been reduced to the problem of argu-
ment classification problem given the predicate and
the argument candidates. The reason we pick PRO-
TEIN names as predicates is that we assume PRO-
TEIN names play a more central role in linking the
binary relations to the final ternary relations.
Compared to a corpus for the standard SRL task,
there are some differences in this task: first is the
relative position of PROTEIN names and ORGAN-
ISM/LOCATION names. Unlike the case in SRL,
where arguments locate either before or after the
predicate, in this application it is possible that one
NE is embedded in another. A second difference is
that a predicate in SRL scenario typically consists of
only one word; here a PROTEIN name can contain
up to 8 words.
We do not use PropBank data in our model at all.
All of our training data and test data is annotated by
domain expert biologists and parsed by Charniak-
Johnson’s parser (released in 2006). When there is
a misalignment between the NE and the constituent
in the parse tree, we insert a new NP parent node for
the NE.

Fig. 3 shows the system overview. The input to
our system consists of titles and abstracts that are
extracted from MEDLINE records. These extracted
sentences have been annotated with the NE infor-
mation (PROTEIN, ORGANISM and LOCATION).
The Syntactic Annotator parses the sentences and in-
serts the head information to the parse trees by using
the Magerman/Collins head percolation rules. The
main component of the system is our SRL-based
relation extraction module, where we first manu-
ally extract features along the path from the PRO-
TEIN name to the ORGANISM/LOCATION name
and then train a binary SVM classifier for the binary
relation extraction. Finally, we fuse the extracted
binary relations into a ternary relation. In contrast
with our discriminative model, a statistical parsing
based generative model (Shi et al., 2007) has been
proposed for a related task on this data set where the
NEs and their relations are extracted together and
used to identify which NEs are relevant in a particu-
lar sentence. Since our final goal is to facilitate the
biologists to generate the annotated corpus, in future

default tree kernel. The models are:
Baseline1 is a purely word-based system, where
the features consist of the unigrams and bigrams
between the PROTEIN name and the ORGAN-
ISM/LOCATION names inclusively, where the stop-
words are selectively eliminated.
Baseline2 is a naive approach that assumes that any
example containing PROTEIN, LOCATION names
has the PL relation. The same assumption is made
for PO and POL relations.
PAK system uses predicate-argument structure ker-
nel (PAK) based method. PAK was defined in (Mos-
chitti, 2004) and only considers the path from the
predicate to the target argument, which in our set-
ting is the path from the PROTEIN to the ORGAN-
ISM or LOCATION names.
SRL is an SRL system which is adapted to use our
new feature set. A default linear kernel is applied
with SVM learning.
TRK system is similar to PAK system except that
the input is an entire parse tree instead of a PAK
path.
TRK+SRL combines full parse trees and manually
extracted features and uses the kernel combination.

We predict the POL ternary relation by fusing PL
and PO binary relations if they belong to the same
sentence and have the same PROTEIN NE. The pre-
diction is made by the sum of confidence scores
(produced by the SVM) of the PL and PO relations.
This is similar to the postprocessing step in SRL task
in which the semantic roles assigned to the argu-
ments have to realize a legal final semantic frame
for the given predicate.

Table 3 shows the results using 5-fold cross valida-
tion. We report figures on ternary relation extraction
and extraction of the two binary relations. Compari-
son between the PAK model and SRL model shows
that manually specified features are more discrimi-
native for binary relation extraction; they boost pre-
cision and accuracy for ternary relation extraction.
In contrast to the SRL model for binary relation ex-
traction, the TRK model obtains lower recall but
higher precision. The combination of SRL with the
TRK system gives best overall accuracy of 71.8%

<bodyText confidence="0.99460225">
In this paper we explored the use of rich syntac-
tic features for the relation extraction task. In con-
trast with the previously used set of syntactic fea-
tures for this task, we use a large number of fea-
tures originally proposed for the Semantic Role La-
beling task. We provide comprehensive experiments
using many different models that use features from
parse trees. Using rich syntactic features by com-
bining SRL features with tree kernels over the en-
tire tree obtains 71.8% accuracy which significantly
outperforms shallow word-based features which ob-
tains 56.3% accuracy.

The models are: Baseline1 is a purely word-based system, where the features consist of the unigrams and bigrams between the PROTEIN name and the ORGANISM/LOCATION names inclusively, where the stopwords are selectively eliminated. Baseline2 is a naive approach that assumes that any example containing PROTEIN, LOCATION names has the PL relation. The same assumption is made for PO and POL relations. PAK system uses predicate-argument structure kernel (PAK) based method. PAK was defined in (Moschitti, 2004) and only considers the path from the predicate to the target argument, which in our setting is the path from the PROTEIN to the ORGANISM or LOCATION names. SRL is an SRL system which is adapted to use our new feature set. A default linear kernel is applied with SVM learning. TRK system is similar to PAK system except that the input is an entire parse tree instead of a PAK path. TRK+SRL combines full parse trees and manually extracted features and uses the kernel combination. 1http://svmlight.joachims.org/ 2http://ai-nlp.info.uniroma2.it/moschitti/TK1.2- software/Tree-Kernel.htm 99 Method PL P</context>

The Syntactic Annotator parses the sentences and inserts the head information to the parse trees by using the Magerman/Collins head percolation rules. The main component of the system is our SRL-based relation extraction module, where we first manually extract features along the path from the PROTEIN name to the ORGANISM/LOCATION name and then train a binary SVM classifier for the binary relation extraction. Finally, we fuse the extracted binary relations into a ternary relation. In contrast with our discriminative model, a statistical parsing based generative model (Shi et al., 2007) has been proposed for a related task on this data set where the NEs and their relations are extracted together and used to identify which NEs are relevant in a particular sentence. Since our final goal is to facilitate the biologists to generate the annotated corpus, in future 98 • each word and its Part-of-Speech (POS) tag of PRO name • head word (hw) and its POS of PRO name • subcategorization that records the immediate structure that expands from PRO name.
