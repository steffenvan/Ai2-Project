We present the advantages of guided sentences
composition for communicating in natural
language with computers. We show how
guidance can be achieved by means of the
partial synthesis of sentences and describe our
approach consisting in separating knowledge
that comes under different levels of
well-formedness and coroutining their
treatment. This approach has led us to develop
in Prolog a software, ILLICO, allowing for the
conception of natural language interfaces with
guided sentences composition. We present an

1 Guided Sentences Composition
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999942436363637">
We may distinguish two kinds of communication
with natural language interfaces:
- a &amp;quot;free&amp;quot; mode : the user types sentences without
knowing the limits of the interface but he hopes
he will be understood. Trivial reality : user&apos;s
freedom will always be the freedom the system
will grant him.
- a guided mode : the system guides the user
while he composes sentences.
Unlike the &amp;quot;free&amp;quot; mode, with guided composition
users quickly perceive the limits of the interface. The
designer does not have to program all the expressions
or structures having the same meaning. Unique forms
and structures are sufficient. He may forget the others.
Guided composition is a powerful principle for natural
language interfaces to database and knowledge access,
operating and command systems. This principle can
also be applied to learning systems (natural languages
or formal ones like database or programming
languages).
Expected formulations can be provided to the user
by means of partial synthesis of sentences. This
principle was introduced by Alain Colmerauer within
the French-English interface, Orbis, which was
connected to a database on planets (Colmerauer and
Kittredge, 1982). The same system is used for
analyzing a given sentence and for synthesizing
expected fomulations. Orbis is implemented in
Prolog and illustrates in a convincing manner the
potential reversibility of certain programs written in
that language.
We are concerned here with the partial synthesis of
sentence from left to right. The main problem of this
approach is that a word or an expression that has been
synthesized by the system (and selected by the user to
compose his sentence) must not lead to a future dead
end. Theoretically, dead ends may issue from different
levels corresponding to the differents levels of
well-formedness of a sentence: lexical, syntactic,
conceptual and contextual levels, in particular.
As a result of formal language theory, we know
that the emptiness problem is solvable for
context-free grammars. So one can take all the levels
of well-formedness into account simultaneously by
merging them into one formalism, a context-free
grammar with symbols reflecting lexical, syntactic,
conceptual and contextual constraints, as it is done for
instance in &amp;quot;semantic grammars&amp;quot;. This is the case in
Tennant&apos;s menu-based system (Tennant, 1984).
The approach we have decided to follow is different.
We are interested in (1) separating knowledge that
comes under different levels (lexical, syntactic,
conceptual) into distinct modules and (2) coroutining
their treatment in order to avoid dead ends along the
guided composition mode.

In our approach, knowledge is separated into four
distinct modules:
- a set of lexical rules (the lexicon) specifies
expected words and expressions;
- in a restricted version of the Metamorphosis
Grammar formalism (Colmerauer, 1975), a set of
syntactic rules (the grammar) defines expected
structures of sentences and grammatical
agreements;
- by means of lambda-expressions operating on the
semantic representation associated with relevant
syntactic categories, a set of semantic rules allows
the production of semantic representations;
- a set of conceptual rules (the conceptual model)
defines domain constraints and connectivity
constraints (Godbert etal., 1993).
The algorithm for coroutining the treatment of the
different kinds of knowledge in order to avoid dead
ends along the guided composition mode is described
in (Milhaud et al., 1992).
Our approach has led us to develop in Prolog a
software, ILLICO, allowing for the conception of

<bodyText confidence="0.999815259259259">
In the framework of the EC TIDE program, we have
developped by means of ILLICO, a communication
aid system for disabled people : the KOMBE system.
KOMBE is devoted to Amyothrophic Lateral
Sclerosis (ALS) patients (Guenthner et al., 1992). In
addition to motor weaknesses, ALS patients, mainly
elderly people, suffer from diseases of the central
nervous system that entail increasing speech
impairment and aggravate their living conditions.
They have not lost their cognitive capacities but are
unable to speck and some of them are unable to write
and communicate only by eye movements. For this
kind of disabled person, the computer-assisted aids
developed so far offer the user relatively slow
communication, composing sentences letter by letter
or selecting a pre-formulated phrase or sentence. Some
systems include a dictionary permitting the user to
select whole words. Guided sentences composition is
a more convivial way for them to communicate. Step
by step, they can select on the screen for selecting
words and expression dynamically synthesized by the
system. Words and expressions generated by the
system always lead to the construction of a lexically,
syntactically and conceptually well-formed sentence.
The following figures show an example of a partial
composition of a sentence by an ALS patient
communicating with a doctor.

For example, the patient can compose the sentence:
J&apos;ai beaucoup de peine a plier le genou gauche (It is
difficult for me to bend my left knee).ALS patients
can compose sentences about several conceptual
situations. The introduction of a new situation only
needs the definition of the associated conceptual model
and lexicon. The grammar and the other components
of the system are domain independant.
In order to resolve the big lexicon problem, the
system proposes several &amp;quot;sub-lexicon&amp;quot; of non empty
intersection. This thematic division is built on tree
structure and operates on the lexicon level.
