<bodyText confidence="0.999514190476191">
In the Japanese language, as a predicate is
placed at the end of a sentence, the con-
tent of a sentence cannot be inferred until
reaching the end. However, when the con-
tent is complicated and the sentence is
long, people want to know at an earlier
stage in the sentence whether the content
is negative, affirmative, or interrogative.
In Japanese, the grammatical form called
the KO-OU relation exists. The KO-OU
relation is a kind of concord. If a KO ele-
ment appears, then an OU element ap-
pears in the latter part of a sentence. It is
being pointed out that the KO-OU relation
gives advance notice to the element that
appears in the latter part of a sentence. In
this paper, we present the method of ex-
tracting automatically the KO-OU expres-
sion data from large-scale electronic
corpus and verify the usefulness of the
KO-OU expression data.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999947392857143">
The Japanese language has a grammatical form
called the KO-OU relation. The KO-OU relation is
a kind of concord, also referring to a sort of bound
relation that a KO element appearing in a sentence
is followed by an OU element in the latter part of
the same sentence. On the contrary, the cooccur-
rence relation refers to two words appearing in the
same sentence.
Because Japanese predicates are usually located
at the end of sentences, the contents of Japanese
sentences cannot be decided until reaching the end.
Furthermore, in Japanese, it is hard to comprehend
the meaning of the sentence without reading
through the entire sentence. The KO-OU relation is
the grammatical form which can be helpful for un-
derstanding the sentence meaning at the early stage.
While in archaic Japanese, KAKARI-MUSUBI,
which had morphemic KO-OU relation between
KAKARI-JOSI1 and the conjugation at the end of a
sentence, had been used. KAKARI-MUSUBI gave
advance notice to the elements that would appear
toward the end of a sentence due to KAKARI-JOSI.
Today, KAKARI-MUSUBI has dropped out of use.
However, the KO-OU relation such as &amp;quot;sika-nai
(only)&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;kessite-nai (never)&amp;quot; is present. In this
research, we have attempted to collect such ele-
ments to extract KO-OU expression data. In this
paper, the main points of argument are as follows:

(Ohno, 1993) pointed out that there were expres-
sions that try to give advance notice to whether a
sentence is affirmative, negative, or interrogative at
the early stage of a language expression which
continues timewise. It suggested that there were
certain adverbs that have replaced KAKARI-JOSI
in the archaic Japanese words.
(Masuoka, 1991) described the KO-OU relation
of sentence elements. According to Masuoka, some
sentences have the KO-OU expressions as shown
in Table 1.
However, this has the following weaknesses.
The KO and OU elements in a KO-OU relation are
placed together in the same category, and there is

<bodyText confidence="0.994395166666667">
no description as to the OU element. Furthermore,
only a limited number of elements are listed. And
the objectivity of the KO and OU elements is not
guaranteed.
The KO-OU expression data is useful as basic
data to dissolve ambiguity in parsing and to decide
on the modification relation. However, first of all,
it is necessary for the data to have a certain length
for being useful basic data. Secondly, it also needs
to be objective. Therefore, we have attempted to
extract KO-OU relations automatically from large-
scale corpus.

Using the KO-OU expression data will enable the
reader to guess the end expression midway through
a sentence. This is because as the KO elements
appear it is possible to predict the appearance of
the OU elements (Figure 2). It can be used as a
basic data for understanding sentences. In addition,
this technology can be used to guess the point in
the minutes of a meeting at which the speakers

(Yamamoto and Umemura, 2002) considered the
estimation of the one-to-many relation between
entities in corpus. They carried out experiments
on extracting one-to-many relation of phenomena
from corpus using complementary similarity
measure (CSM) which can cope very well with
inclusion relation of appearance patterns. The KO-
OU relation in this research can be regarded as a
type of one-to-many relation.

In this paper, we dealt with what is called FUKU-
JOSI2, KAKARI-JOSI, and some adverbs shown
below. We proceeded on the assumption that these
are the KO elements in the KO-OU relation. For
our research, we used newspaper articles from the
Mainichi Shimbun, Nihon Keizai Shimbun, and
Yomiuri Shimbun issued between 1991 and 2000.

5.1 Necessity to Give Meaning/Information
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999691647058824">
If the KO-OU expression data is used for gradual
understanding of sentences, it was necessary for
the data to be given meaning/information. When
the KO element appears, it will be possible to suf-
ficiently grasp or guess the contents of a sentence
by referring the KO-OU expression data (Figure2).
However it is difficult to give mean-
ing/information using the data obtained from the
process in Chapter 4 because the data is broken
down into each morpheme by the morphological
analysis, and each element is too short.
In Japanese sentences, there are many cases in
which continuation of a particle and an auxiliary
verb builds a predicate. This continuation plays an
important role in determining the event of the sen-
tence. Particles and auxiliary verbs are functional
words. Therefore, it is not possible to determine
the meaning of some of the particles and auxiliary
verbs when they appeared independently. Fur-
thermore, there are some cases in which they
change their meaning when paired with another
word.
Table 2 shows the OU elements obtained pursu-
ant to the procedure in Chapter 4 for KO element
&amp;quot;kitto&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;Da&amp;quot; listed in Table 2 has an assertive
meaning when used in a sentence like &amp;quot;kyou wa
ame da . (It is raining today.)&amp;quot; On the other hand, it
has an inferential meaning in the context of &amp;quot;asu
wa hareru daro-u . (It should be fine tomorrow.)&amp;quot; In
addition, although &amp;quot;nai&amp;quot; is a negative auxiliary
verb, when it is paired as in &amp;quot;ka-mo-shire-nai (may
be)&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;chigai-nai (must be),&amp;quot; the negative mean-
ing disappears. And the overall pairing stands for
guess and conviction.

5.2 Verification of OU Element Using
&amp;quot;Kitto&amp;quot;
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99985625">
In this section, we carry out an analytical example
using OU element for KO element &amp;quot;kitto (cer-
tainly).&amp;quot; We can classify the OU elements obtained
from the procedure in Chapter 4, as follows:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.993487">
(a) It can be an OU element by itself,
(b) It can become an OU element when paired
with others,
(c) It does not have the possibility of becoming an
OU element.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.884705">
Words of (c) were not found in the OU ele-
ments obtained for KO element &amp;quot;kitto.&amp;quot; In the fol-
lowing, we will describe the details on (a) and (b).
(a) OU element by itself
Out of the OU elements for KO element &amp;quot;kitto&amp;quot; in
Table 2, &amp;quot;hazu&amp;quot; can be an OU element by itself.
[1] koudaina umibe de miru sakuhin wa kitto miryokuteki
ni utsuru hazu da .
(Works that you see at the open seaside should look attractive.)
This is the only sentence with an independent
OU element for &amp;quot;kitto&amp;quot; in the data obtained from
the process in Chapter 4. The same can be said of
data for KO elements other than &amp;quot;kitto.&amp;quot; Because
of morphological analysis, the row of letters has
been shortened. As a result, there are few ele-
ments that can be regarded as an OU element by
itself. And just looking at this element does not
determine the meaning.
(b) OU element when paired with others
When &amp;quot;chigai&amp;quot; is paired with &amp;quot;ni&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;nai&amp;quot; to
make &amp;quot;ni-chigai-nai (must be),&amp;quot; it becomes an OU
element. Similarly, pairing &amp;quot;da&amp;quot; with &amp;quot;u&amp;quot; results in
an OU element &amp;quot;daro-u (perhaps).&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Da&amp;quot; is the
original form of &amp;quot;daro&amp;quot; and becomes &amp;quot;daro-u&amp;quot;
when paired with &amp;quot;u.&amp;quot;

As we described in Chapter 5, it is necessary to
pair multiple elements before giving mean-
ing/information. We currently persuade the issue
of automatic generation of pairing multiple ele-
ments. Now, we are carrying out experiments on
calculating the similarity measure of pairing of
elements. These will give us pairing of automati-
cally generated elements and the similarity meas-
ure of the pairings. This should be useful data for
resolving ambiguity (Figure 1).
