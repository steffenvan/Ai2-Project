Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999923315789474">
We introduce a method for learning to
predict the following grammar and text
of the ongoing translation given a source
text. In our approach, predictions are
offered aimed at reducing users’ burden
on lexical and grammar choices, and
improving productivity. The method
involves learning syntactic phraseology
and translation equivalents. At run-time,
the source and its translation prefix are
sliced into ngrams to generate subsequent
grammar and translation predictions. We
present a prototype writing assistant,
TransAhead1, that applies the method to
where computer-assisted translation and
language learning meet. The preliminary
results show that the method has great
potentials in CAT and CALL (significant
boost in translation quality is observed).

More and more language learners use the MT
systems on the Web for language understanding
or learning. However, web translation systems
typically suggest a, usually far from perfect, one-
best translation and hardly interact with the user.
Language learning/sentence translation could
be achieved more interactively and appropriately
if a system recognized translation as a
collaborative sequence of the user’s learning and
choosing from the machine-generated predictions
of the next-in-line grammar and text and the
machine’s adapting to the user’s accepting
/overriding the suggestions.
Consider the source sentence “我們在結束這個
交易上扮演重要角色” (We play an important role
in closing this deal). The best learning
environment is probably not the one solely

providing the automated translation. A good
learning environment might comprise a writing
assistant that gives the user direct control over
the target text and offers text and grammar
predictions following the ongoing translations.
We present a new system, TransAhead, that
automatically learns to predict/suggest the
grammatical constructs and lexical translations
expected to immediately follow the current
translation given a source text, and adapts to the
user’s choices. Example TransAhead responses
to the source “我們在結束這個交易上扮演重要角色”
and the ongoing translation “we” and “we play
an important role” are shown in Figure 12(a) and
(b) respectively. TransAhead has determined the
probable subsequent grammatical constructions
with constituents lexically translated, shown in
pop-up menus (e.g., Figure 1(b) shows a
prediction “IN[in] VBG[close, end, ...]” due to
the history “play role” where lexical items in
square brackets are lemmas of potential
translations). TransAhead learns these constructs
and translations during training.
At run-time, TransAhead starts with a source
sentence, and iteratively collaborates with the
user: by making predictions on the successive
grammar patterns and lexical translations, and by
adapting to the user’s translation choices to
reduce source ambiguities (e.g., word
segmentation and senses). In our prototype,
TransAhead mediates between users and
automatic modules to boost users’ writing/
translation performance (e.g., productivity).

time updating the system’s segmentation
/translation options through the user’s word
choices. Our intended users are different from
those of the previous research focusing on what
professional translator can bring for MT systems
(e.g., Brown and Nirenburg, 1990).
More recently, interactive MT (IMT) systems
have begun to shift the user’s role from analyses
of the source text to the formation of the target
translation. TransType project (Foster et al., 2002)
describes such pioneering system that supports
next word predictions. Koehn (2009) develops
caitra which displays one phrase translation at a
time and offers alternative translation options.
Both systems are similar in spirit to our work.
The main difference is that we do not expect the
user to be a professional translator and we
provide translation hints along with grammar
predictions to avoid the generalization issue
facing phrase-based system.
Recent work has been done on using fully-
fledged statistical MT systems to produce target
hypotheses completing user-validated translation
prefix in IMT paradigm. Barrachina et al. (2008)
investigate the applicability of different MT
kernels within IMT framework. Nepveu et al.
(2004) and Ortiz-Martinez et al. (2011) further
exploit user feedbacks for better IMT systems
and user experience. Instead of trigged by user
correction, our method is triggered by word
delimiter and assists in target language learning.
In contrast to the previous CAT research, we
present a writing assistant that suggests
subsequent grammar constructs with translations
and interactively collaborates with learners, in
view of reducing users’ burden on grammar and
word choice and enhancing their writing quality.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.995253">
3.1 Problem Statement
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998142684210526">
For CAT and CALL, we focus on predicting a
set of grammar patterns with lexical translations
likely to follow the current target translation
given a source text. The predictions will be
examined by a human user directly. Not to
overwhelm the user, our goal is to return a
reasonable-sized set of predictions that contain
suitable word choices and correct grammar to
choose and learn from. Formally speaking,
Problem Statement: We are given a target-
language reference corpus Ct, a parallel corpus
Cst, a source-language text S, and its target
translation prefix Tp. Our goal is to provide a set
of predictions based on Ct and Cst likely to
further translate S in terms of grammar and text.
For this, we transform S and Tp into sets of
ngrams such that the predominant grammar
constructs with suitable translation options
following Tp are likely to be acquired.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999761">
3.2 Learning to Find Pattern and Translation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998755">
We attempt to find syntax-based phraseology and
translation equivalents beforehand (four-staged)
so that a real-time system is achievable.
Firstly, we syntactically analyze the corpus Ct.
In light of the phrases in grammar book (e.g.,
one’s in “make up one’s mind”), we resort to
parts-of-speech for syntactic generalization.
Secondly, we build up inverted files of the words
in Ct for the next stage (i.e., pattern grammar
generation). Apart from sentence and position
information, a word’s lemma and part-of-speech
(POS) are also recorded.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.995573">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.995959">
We then leverage the procedure in Figure 2 to
generate grammar patterns for any given
sequence of words (e.g., contiguous or not).

<figure confidence="0.9164413125">

The algorithm first identifies the sentences
containing the given sequence of words, query.
Iteratively, Step (3) performs an AND operation
on the inverted file, InvList, of the current word
wi and interInvList, a previous intersected results.
Afterwards, we analyze query’s syntax-based
phraseology (Step (5)). For each element of the
form ([wordPosi(w1),...,wordPosi(wn)], sentence
number) denoting the positions of query’s words
in the sentence, we generate grammar pattern
involving replacing words with POS tags and
words in wordPosi(wi) with lemmas, and
extracting fixed-window3 segments surrounding
query from the transformed sentence. The result
is a set of grammatical, contextual patterns.
The procedure finally returns top N
predominant syntactic patterns associated with
the query. Such patterns characterizing the
query’s word usages follow the notion of pattern
grammar in (Hunston and Francis, 2000) and are
collected across the target language.
In the fourth and final stage, we exploit Cst for
bilingual phrase acquisition, rather than a manual
dictionary, to achieve better translation coverage
and variety. We obtain phrase pairs through
leveraging IBM models to word-align the bitexts,
“smoothing” the directional word alignments via
grow-diagonal-final, and extracting translation
equivalents using (Koehn et al., 2003).

Once translation equivalents and phraseological

retrieve the translations and patterns learned
from Section 3.2. Step (3) acquires the active
target-language vocabulary that may be used to
translate the source text. To alleviate the word
boundary issue in MT raised by Ma et al. (2007),
TransAhead non-deterministically segments the
source text using character ngrams and proceeds
with collaborations with the user to obtain the
segmentation for MT and to complete the
translation. Note that a user vocabulary of
preference (due to users’ domain of knowledge
or errors of the system) may be exploited for
better system performance. On the other hand,
Step (4) extracts patterns preceding with the
history ngrams of {tj}.

In Step (5), we first evaluate and rank the
translation candidates using linear combination:
λ1×(P(t si)+P(si t))+λ2× P2(t Tp)
where λi is combination weight, P1 and P2 are
translation and language model respectively, and
t is one of the translation candidates under S and
Tp. Subsequently, we incorporate the lemmatized
translation candidates into grammar constituents
in GramOptions. For example, we would include
“close” in pattern “play role IN[in] VBG” as
“play role IN[in] VBG[close]”.
At last, the algorithm returns the
representative grammar patterns with confident
translations expected to follow the ongoing
translation and further translate the source. This
algorithm will be triggered by word delimiter to
provide an interactive environment where CAT
and CALL meet.

To train TransAhead, we used British National
Corpus and Hong Kong Parallel Text and
deployed GENIA tagger for POS analyses.
To evaluate TransAhead in CAT and CALL,
we introduced it to a class of 34 (Chinese) first-
year college students learning English as foreign
language. Designed to be intuitive to the general
public, esp. language learners, presentational
tutorial lasted only for a minute. After the tutorial,
the participants were asked to translate 15

Chinese texts from (Huang et al., 2011a) one by
one (half with TransAhead assistance, and the
other without). Encouragingly, the experimental
group (i.e., with the help of our system) achieved
much better translation quality than the control
group in BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) (i.e.,
35.49 vs. 26.46) and significantly reduced the
performance gap between language learners and
automatic decoder of Google Translate (44.82).
We noticed that, for the source “我們在結束這lx
易上扮演重要角色”, 90% of the participants in the
experimental group finished with more
grammatical and fluent translations (see Figure 4)
than (less interactive) Google Translate (“We
conclude this transaction plays an important
role”). In comparison, 50% of the translations of
the source from the control group were erroneous.

5. Future Work and Summary
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99997892">
Many avenues exist for future research and
improvement. For example, in the linear
combination, the patterns’ frequencies could be
considered and the feature weight could be better
tuned. Furthermore, interesting directions to
explore include leveraging user input such as
(Nepveu et al., 2004) and (Ortiz-Martinez et al.,
2010) and serially combining a grammar checker
(Huang et al., 2011b). Yet another direction
would be to investigate the possibility of using
human-computer collaborated translation pairs to
re-train word boundaries suitable for MT.
In summary, we have introduced a method for
learning to offer grammar and text predictions
expected to assist the user in translation and
writing (or even language learning). We have
implemented and evaluated the method. The
preliminary results are encouragingly promising,
prompting us to further qualitatively and
quantitatively evaluate our system in the near
future (i.e., learners’ productivity, typing speed
and keystroke ratios of “del” and “backspace”
(possibly hesitating on the grammar and lexical
choices), and human-computer interaction,
among others).

For each element of the form ([wordPosi(w1),...,wordPosi(wn)], sentence number) denoting the positions of query’s words in the sentence, we generate grammar pattern involving replacing words with POS tags and words in wordPosi(wi) with lemmas, and extracting fixed-window3 segments surrounding query from the transformed sentence. The result is a set of grammatical, contextual patterns. The procedure finally returns top N predominant syntactic patterns associated with the query. Such patterns characterizing the query’s word usages follow the notion of pattern grammar in (Hunston and Francis, 2000) and are collected across the target language.
