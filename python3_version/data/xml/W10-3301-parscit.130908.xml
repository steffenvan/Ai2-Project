<bodyText confidence="0.999891777777778">
This document describes an open
text-mining system that was developed
for the Asian-European project KYOTO.
The KYOTO system uses an open text
representation format and a central onto-
logy to enable extraction of knowledge
and facts from large volumes of text in
many different languages. We implemen-
ted a semantic tagging approach that per-
forms off-line reasoning. Mining of facts
and knowledge is achieved through a
flexible pattern matching module that can
work in much the same way for different
languages, can handle efficiently large
volumes of documents and is not restric-
ted to a specific domain. We applied the
system to an English database on estuar-
ies.

Traditionally, Information Extraction (IE) is the
task of filling template information from previ-
ously unseen text which belongs to a predefined
domain (Peshkin &amp; Pfeffer 2003). Most systems
in the Message Understanding Conferences
(MUC, 1987-1998) and the Automatic Content
Extraction program (ACE)1 use a pipeline of
tools to achieve this, ranging from sophisticated
NLP tools (like deep parsing) to shallower text-
processing (e.g. FASTUS (Appelt 1995)).
Standard IE systems are based on lan-
guage-specific pattern matching (Kaiser &amp;

Miksch 2005), where each pattern consists of a
regular expression and an associated mapping
from syntactic to logical form. In general, the ap-
proaches can be categorized into two groups: (1)
the Knowledge Engineering approach (Appelt et
al.1995), and (2) the learning approach, such as
AutoSlog (Appelt et al. 1993), SRV (Freitag
1998), or RAPIER (Califf &amp; R. Mooney 1999).
Another important system is GATE (Cunning-
ham et al.2002), which is a platform for creating
IE systems. It uses regular expressions, but it can
also use ontologies to perform semantic infer-
ences to constrain linguistic patterns semantic-
ally. The use of ontologies in IE is an emerging
field (Bontcheva &amp; Wilks 2004): linking text in-
stances with elements belonging to the ontology,
instead of consulting flat gazetteers.
The major disadvantage of traditional IE sys-
tems is that they focus on satisfying precise, nar-
row, pre-specified requests from small homogen-
eous corpora (e.g., extract information about ter-
rorist events). Likewise, they are not flexible, are
limited to specific types of knowledge and need
to be built by knowledge engineers for each spe-
cific application and language. In fact most text
mining systems are developed for a single do-
main and a single language, and are not able to
handle knowledge expressed in different lan-
guages or expressed and conceptualized differ-
ently across cultures.
In this paper we describe an open platform for
text-mining or IE that can be applied to many
different languages in the same way using an
open text representation system and a central on-

off-line reasoning and ontological tagging. The

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999979185185185">
The KYOTO project allows communities to
model terms and concepts in their domain and to
use this knowledge to apply text mining on docu-
ments. The knowledge cycle in the KYOTO sys-
tem starts with a set of source documents pro-
duced by the community, such as PDFs and web-
sites. Linguistic processors apply tokenization,
segmentation, morpho-syntactic analysis and se-
mantic processing to the text in different lan-
guages. The semantic processing involves the de-
tection of named-entities (persons, organizations,
places, time-expressions) and determining the
meaning of words in the text according to the
given wordnet.
The output of the linguistic processors is
stored in an XML annotation format that is the
same for all the languages, called the KYOTO
Annotation Format (KAF, Bosma et al 2009).
This format incorporates standardized proposals
for the linguistic annotation of text and represents
them in an easy-to-use layered structure, which is
compatible with the Linguistic Annotation Frame-
work (LAF, Ide and Romary 2003). In KAF,
words, terms, constituents and syntactic depend-
encies are stored in separate layers with refer-
ences across the structures. This makes it easier
to harmonize the output of linguistic processors
</bodyText>

for different languages and to add new semantic
layers to the basic output, when needed (Bosma
et al. 2009, Vossen et al. 2010). All modules in
KYOTO draw their input from these structures.
In fact, the word-sense disambiguation process is
carried out to the same KAF annotation in differ-
ent languages and is therefore the same for all the
languages (Agirre et al. 2009). In the current sys-
tem, there are processors for English, Dutch,
Italian, Spanish, Basque, Chinese and Japanese.
The KYOTO system proceeds in 2 cycles (see
Figure 1). In the 1st cycle, the Tybot (Term Yield-
ing Robot) extracts the most relevant terms from
the documents. The Tybot is another generic pro-
gram that can do this for all the different lan-
guages in much the same way. The terms are or-
ganized as a structured hierarchy and, wherever
possible, related to generic semantic databases,
i.e. wordnets for each language. In the left part of
Figure 1, we show those terms in the input docu-
ment and their classification in wordnet. Terms in
italics are present in the original wordnet, while
underlined terms correspond to terms which were
not in the original wordnet but were automatic-
ally discovered and linked to wordnet by Tybots.
Straight terms correspond to hyperonyms in
wordnet that do not necessarily occur in the text
but are linked to ontological classes. The result of
this 1st cycle is a domain wordnet for the target
language.
The 2nd cycle of the system involves the actu-
al extraction of factual knowledge from the docu-
ments by the Kybots (Knowledge Yielding Ro-
bots). Kybots use a collection of profiles that rep-
resent patterns of information of interest. In the
profile, conceptual relations are expressed using
ontological and morpho-syntactic linguistic pat-
terns. Since the semantics is defined through the
ontology, it is possible to detect similar data
across documents in different languages, even if
expressed differently. In Figure 1, we give an ex-
ample of a conceptual pattern that relates organ-
isms that live in habitats. The Kybot can combine
morpho-syntactic and semantic patterns. When a
match is detected, the instantiation of the pattern
is saved in a formal representation, either in KAF
or in RDF. Since the wordnets in different lan-
guages are mapped to the same ontology and the
text in these languages is represented in the same
KAF, similar patterns can easily be applied to
multiple languages.

3 Ontological and lexical background
knowledge
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999358816326531">
As a semantic background model, we defined a
3-layered knowledge architecture following the
principle of the division of labour (Putnam
1975). In this model, the ontology does not need
to be the central hub for all terms in a domain in
all languages. Following the division of labour
principle, we can state that a computer does not
need to distinguish between instances of a
European Tree Frog and a Glass Tree frog. We
assume that rigid concepts (as defined by
Guarino and Welty 2002) are known to the do-
main experts and do not need to be defined form-
ally in the ontology but can remain in the avail-
able background resources, such as databases
with millions of species. Terms in the documents
are mostly non-rigid, e.g. endangered frogs, in-
vasive frogs. Such non-rigid terms refer to in-
stances of species in contextual circumstances.
The processes and states are the important pieces
of information that matter to the users and are
useful for mining text. The model therefore dis-
tinguishes between background vocabularies, do-
main terms, wordnets and the central ontology.
The background vocabularies are automatically
aligned to wordnet, where we assume that
hyponymy relations to rigid synsets in wordnet
declare those subconcepts as rigid subtypes too,
without the necessity to include them in the onto-
logy. For non-rigid terms, we defined a set of
mapping relations to the ontology through which
we express their non-rigid involvement in these
processes and states. Likewise, the ontology has
been extended with processes and states for the
domain and verbs and adjectives have been
mapped to be able to detect expressions in text.
The 3-layered knowledge model combines the
efforts from 3 different communities:
1.Domain experts in social communities that
continuously build background vocabularies;
2.Wordnet specialists that define the basic se-
mantic model for general concepts for a lan-
guage
3.Semantic Web specialists that define top-level
and domain-specific ontologies that capture
formal definitions of concepts;
We formalized the relations between these repos-
itories so that they can developed separately but
combined within KYOTO to form a coherent and
formal model.

3.1 Ontology
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999644464285714">
The KYOTO ontology currently consists of 1149
classes divided over three layers. The top layer is
based on DOLCE (DOLCE-Lite-Plus version
3.9.7, Masolo et al 2003) and OntoWordNet.
This layer of the ontology has been modified for
our purposes (Herold et. al. 2009). The second
layer consists of so-called Base Concepts (BCs)
derived from various wordnets (Vossen 1998,
Izquierdo et al. 2007). Examples of BCs are:
building, vehicle, animal, plant, change, move,
size, weight. The BCs are those synsets in Word-
Net 3.0 that have the most relations with other
synsets in the wordnet hierarchies and are selec-
ted in a way that ensures complete coverage of
the nominal and verbal part of WordNet. This has
been completed for the nouns (about 500
synsets). The ontology has also been adapted to
include important concepts in the domain. Spe-
cial attention has been paid to represents the pro-
cesses (perdurants) in which objects (endur-
ants) of the domain are involved and qualities
they may have. This is typically the information
that is found in documents on the environment.
We thus added 40 new event classes for repres-
enting important verbs (e.g. pollute, absorb,
damage, drain) and 115 new qualities and qual-
ity-regions for representing important adjectives
(e.g. airborne, acid, (un)healthy, clear). The full

ontology can be downloaded from the KYOTO
website, free for use. A considerable set of gener-
al verbs and adjectives (relevant for for the do-
main) have then been mapped to ontological
classes: 189 verbal synsets and 222 adjectival
synsets.
The 500 nominal BCs are connected to the
complete WordNet hierarchy, whereas the 189
verbs represent 5,978 more specific verbal syn-
sets and the 222 adjectives represent 1,081 ad-
jectival synsets through the wordnet relations.
This basic ontology and the mapping to Word-
Net are used to model the shared and lan-
guage-neutral concepts and relations in the do-
main. Instances are excluded from the ontology.
Instances will be detected in the documents and
will be mapped to the ontology through instance
to ontology relations (see below). Likewise, we
make a clear separation between the ontological
model and the instantiation of the model as de-
scribed in the text.

3.2 Wordnet to ontology mappings
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999413666666667">
In addition to the ontology, we have wordnets for
each language in the domain. In addition to the
regular synset to synset relations in the wordnet,
we will have a specific set of relations for map-
ping the synsets to the ontology, which are all
prefixed with sc_ standing for synset-to-concept.
We differentiate between rigid and non-rigid con-
cepts in the wordnets through the mapping rela-
tions:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9993064">
• sc_equivalenceOf: the synset is fully equi-
valent to the ontology Type &amp; inherits all proper-
ties; the synset is Rigid
• sc_ subclassOf: the synset is a proper sub-
class of the ontology Type &amp; inherits all proper-
ties; the synset is Rigid
• sc_domainOf: the synset is not a proper sub-
class of the ontology Type &amp; is not disjoint
(therefore orthogonal) with other synsets that are
mapped to the same Type either through sc_sub-
classOf or sc_domainOf; the synset is non-Rigid
but still inherits all properties of the target onto-
logy Type; the synset is also related to a Role
with a sc_playRole relation
• sc_playRole: the synset denotes instances
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.6950624">
for which the context of the Role applies for
some period of time but this is not essential for
the existence of the instances, i.e. if the context
ceases to exist then the instances may still exist
(Mizoguchi et al. 2007).3
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.972226375">
• sc_participantOf: instances of the concept
(denoted by the synset) participate in some en-
durant, where the specific role relation is indic-
ated by the playRole mapping.
• sc_hasState: instances of the concept are in
a particular state which is not essential and can
be changed. There is no need to represent the role
for a stative perdurant.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.995406458333333">
This model extends existing WordNet to onto-
logy mappings. For instance, in the SUMO to
Wordnet mapping (Niles and Pease 2003), only
the sc_equivalenceOf and sc_subclassOf rela-
tions are used, represented by the symbols ‘=’
and ‘+’ respectively. The SUMO-Wordnet map-
ping likewise does not systematically distinguish
rigid from non-rigid synsets. In our model, we
separate the linguistically and culturally specific
vocabularies from the shared ontology while us-
ing the ontology to interface the concepts used
by the various communities.
Using these mapping relations, we can express
that the synset for duck (which has a hypernym
relation to the synset bird, which, in its turn, has
an equivalence relation to the ontology class
bird) is thus a proper subclassOf the ontology
class bird:
wn:duck hypernym wn:bird
wn:bird sc_equivalenceOf ont:bird
For a concept such as migratory bird, which is
also a hyponym of bird in wordnet but not a
proper subclass as a non-rigid concept, we thus
create the following mapping:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.47125625">
wn:migratory bird
→ sc_domainOf ont:bird
→ sc_playRole ont:done-by
→ sc_participantOf ont:migration
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9995895">
This mapping indicates that the synset is used to
refer to instances of endurants (not subclasses!),
where the domain is restricted to birds. Further-
more, these instances participate in the process of

<footnote confidence="0.84852175">
3 Some terms involve more than one role, e.g. gas-
powered-vehicle. Secondary participants are related
through sc_hasCoParticipant and sc_playCoRole
mappings.

migration in the role of done-by. The properties
of the process migration are further defined in
the ontology, which indicates that it is a act-
ive-change-of-location done-by some endurant,
going from a source, via a path to some destina-
tion. The mapping relations from the wordnet to
the ontology, need to satisfy the constraints of the
ontology, i.e. only roles can be expressed that are
compatible with the role-schema of the process
in which they participate.
For implied non-essential states, we use the
sc_hasState relation to express that a synset such
as wild dog refers to instances of dogs that life in
the wild but can stop being wild:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.7166065">
wn:wild dog → sc_domainOf ont:dog
wn:wild dog → sc_hasState ont:wild
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.998728388888889">
Ideally, all processes and states that can be ap-
plied to endurants should be defined in the onto-
logy. This may hold for most verbs and adject-
ives in languages, which do not tend to extend in
specific domains and are part of the general
vocabulary (e.g. to pollute, to reduce, wild).
However, domain specific text contain many new
nominal terms that refer to domain-specific pro-
cesses and states, e.g. air pollution, nitrogen pol-
lution, nitrogen reduction. These terms are
equally relevant as their counter-parts that refer
to endurants involved in similar processes, e.g.
polluted air, polluting nitrogen or reduced nitro-
gen. We therefore use the reverse participant and
role mappings to be able to define such terms for
processes as subclasses of more general pro-
cesses involving specific participants in a spe-
cified role:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.979956833333333">
wn:air pollution
→ sc_subcassOf ont:pollution (perdurant)
→ sc_hasParticipant ont:air
→ sc_hasRole ont:patient
wn:nitrogen pollution
→ sc_subcassOf ont:pollution (perdurant)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.960822272727273">
→ sc_hasParticipant ont:nitrogen
→ sc_hasRole ont:done-by
Further mapping relations are described in the
documentation on the KYOTO website. Through
the mapping relations, we can keep the ontology
relatively small and compact whereas we can still
define the richness of the vocabularies of lan-
guages in a precise way. The classes in the onto-
logy can be defined using rich axioms that model
precise implications for inferencing. The wordnet
to synset mappings can be used to define rather
basic relations relative to the given ontology that
still captures the semantics of the terms. The
term definitions capture both relevance and per-
spective (those relations that matter from the
point of the view of the term), on the one hand,
and some semantics with respect to the concepts
that are involved and their (role) relation on the
other hand. Likewise, the KYOTO system can
model the linguistic and cultural diversity of lan-
guages in a domain but at the same time keep a
firm anchoring to a basic and compact ontology.

3.3 Domain wordnet
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999980137931035">
We selected 3 representative documents on estu-
aries to extract relevant terms for the domain us-
ing the Tybot module. The terms have been re-
lated through structural relations, e.g. nitrogen
pollution is a hyponym of pollution, and through
WordNet synsets that are assigned through WSD
of the text. We extracted 3950 candidate terms
form the KAF representations of the documents.
Most of these are nouns (2818 terms). The nom-
inal terms matched for 40% with wordnet syn-
sets, the verbs and adjectives for 98% and 85%
respectively. For the domain wordnet, we restric-
ted ourselves to the nouns. From the new nomin-
al terms, environmentalists selected 390 terms
that they deem to be important. These terms are
connected to parent terms, which ultimately are
connected to wordnet synsets. The final domain
wordnet contains 659 synsets: 197 synsets from
the generic wordnet and 462 new synsets connec-
ted to the former. The domain wordnet synsets
got 990 mappings to the ontology, using the rela-
tions described in the previous section. There are
86 synsets that have a sc_domainOf mapping, in-
dicating that they are non-rigid. Note that
hyponyms of these synsets are also non-rigid by
definition. These non-rigid synsets have complex
mappings to processes and states in which they
are involved. The domain wordnet can be down-
loaded from the KYOTO website, free for use.

4 Off-line reasoning and ontological tag-
ging
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999975352941177">
The ontological tagging represents the last phase
in the KYOTO Linguistic Processor annotation
pipeline. It consists of a three-step module de-
vised to enrich the KAF documents with know-
ledge derived from the ontology. For each synset
connected to a term, the first step adds the Base
Concepts to which the synset is related through
the wordnet taxonomical relations. Then, through
the synset to ontology mapping, it adds the cor-
responding ontology type with appropriate rela-
tions. Once each synset is specified as to its onto-
logy type, the last ontotagging step inserts the
full set of ontological implications that follow
from the explicit ontology. The explicit ontology
is a new data structure consisting of a table with
all ontology nodes and all ontological implica-
tions expressed. The main purpose is to optimize

<bodyText confidence="0.999903608695652">
the performance of the mining module over large
quantities of documents. The advantage for Ky-
bots from ontotagging are many. First of all, they
are able to run and apply pattern-matching to
Base Concepts and ontological classes rather
than just to words or synsets. Moreover, by mak-
ing explicit the implicit ontological statements,
Kybots are able to find the same relations hidden
in different expressions with different surface
realizations: fish migration, migratory fish, mi-
gration of fish, fishes that migrate, that directly
or indirectly express the same relations. With on-
totagging, they share the same ontological im-
plications which will allow Kybots to apply the
same patterns and perform the extraction of facts.
The implications will be represented in the same
way across different languages, thus facilitating
cross-lingual extraction of facts. Lastly, ontotag-
ging is a kind of off-line ontological reasoning:
without doing reasoning over concepts, Kybots
substantially improve their performance. Figure
2 shows the result of onto-tagging for the term
pollution.

5 Event and fact extraction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999761666666667">
Kybots (Knowledge Yielding Robots) are com-
puter programs that use the mined
concepts and the generic concepts already con-
nected to the language wordnets and the KYOTO
ontology to extract actual concept instances and
relations in KAF documents. Kybots incorporate
technology for the extraction of relationships,
either eventual or not, relative to the general or
domain concepts already captured by the Tybots.
That is, the extraction of factual knowledge is be-
ing carried out by the Kybot server by processing
Kybot profiles on the linguistically enriched doc-
uments.
Kybots are defined following a declarative
format, the so called Kybot
profiles, which describe general morpho-syntact-
ic and semantic conditions on sequences of
terms. Profiles are compiled to generate the Ky-
bots, which scan over KAF documents searching
for the patterns and extract the relevant informa-
tion from each matching.
Linguistic patterns include morphologic con-
straints and also semantic conditions the matched
terms must hold. Kybot are thus able to search
for term lemmas or part-of-speech tags but also
for terms linked to ontological process and states
using the mappings described in Section 3.2.
Thus, it is possible to detect similar eventual in-
formation across documents in different lan-
guages, even if expressed differently.

5.1 Example of a Kybot Profile
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.989074121212121">
Kybot Profiles are described using XML syn-
tax. Figure 3 presents an example of a profile.
Kybot profiles consist of three main parts:
•Variable declaration (&lt;variables&gt; element):
In this section the search entities are defined. The
example defines three variables: x (denoting
terms whose part-of-speech is noun), y (which
are terms whose lemma is “release”, “produce”
or “generate” but not “create”) and z (terms
linked to the ontological endurant “DOLCE-L-
ite.owl#contamination_pollution”, meaning ̏be-
ing contaminated with harmful substances&amp;quot;).
•Declarations of the relations among variables
(&lt;rel&gt; element): specify the relations among the
previously defined variables. The example pro-
file specifies y as the main pivot, and states that
variable x must be preceding variable y in the
same sentence, and that variable z must be fol-
lowing variable y. Thus, the Kybot will search
for patterns like &apos;x → y → z&apos; in a sentence.
•Output template (&lt;events&gt; element): describes
the output to be produced on every matching. In
the example, each match generates a new event
targeting term y, which becomes the main term
of the event. It also fills two roles of the event,
the &apos;agent&apos; role filled by term x and &apos;patient&apos; role,
filled by z.
Figure 4 presents the output of the Kybot
when applied against the benchmark documents.
The Kybot output follows the stand-off architec-
ture when producing new information, and it thus
forms a new KAF layer on the original docu-
ments.

<bodyText confidence="0.999991">
We applied the KYOTO system and resources to
English documents on estuaries. We collected 50
URLs for two English estuaries: the Humber Es-
tuary in Hull (UK) and the Chesapeake Bay estu-
ary in the US and for background documents on
bird migration, sedimentation, habitat destruc-
tion, and climate change. In addition to the
webpages, we extracted 815 PDF files from the
sites. In total, 4625 files have been extracted. All

<bodyText confidence="0.9999407">
the documents have been processed by the lin-
guistic processor for English, which generated
KAF representations for all the documents. From
this database, 3 documents were selected for
benchmarking.
The documents were processed by applying
multiword tagging, word-sense-disambiguation,
named-entity-recognition and the ontological
tagging to the 3 documents and to the complete
database; This was done twice: once without the
domain model and once with the domain model.
We thus created 4 datasets: 3 benchmark docu-
ments processed with and without the domain
model; the complete database processed with and
without the domain model.
Furthermore, we created Kybot profiles based
on the type of information represented in the do-
main model. We applied the Kybots to all 4 data
sets. We generate the following data files through
an WN-LMF export of the domain wordnet:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.993302142857143">
1. a set of domain multiwords for the multi-
word tagger
2. an extension of the lexicon and the graph
of concepts that is used by the WSD
module
3. an extension of the wordnet-to-ontology
mappings for the ontotagger
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999752163265306">
In addition, we constructed mapping lists for all
WordNet 3.0 synsets to Base Concepts and to ad-
jective and verbs that are matched to the onto-
logy. These mappings provide the generic con-
ceptual model based on wordnet and on the onto-
logy.
Table 1 shows the effects of using the domain
model for the first 3 modules. We can see that the
domain model has a clear effect on the multi-
word detection in the 3 evaluation documents.
Using the domain model, 600 multiwords have
been detected, against 145 with just the generic
wordnet. This is obvious since the terms are ex-
tracted from the same documents. However,
when applying it to the complete database, we
see that still over 2,300 more multiwords have
been detected using the domain wordnet. Note
that the domain wordnet has only 97 multiwords
and the generic wordnet has 19,126 multiwords.
So 0.5% of the multiwords in the domain word-
net add 1.5 times more multiword tokens in the
database. The third row specifies the number of
synsets that have been assigned. We can see that
for the domain model almost 400 more synsets
have been detected. In the case of the full estuary
database, we see that relatively few more have
been detected, almost 1,500 while the database is
80 times as big. If we look more closely at the
numbers of actual domain synsets detected, we
see the following results. In the benchmark docu-
ments 637 (or 5%) of the synsets is a domain
wordnet synset, whereas 5,353 synsets are do-
main synsets in the full estuary database, which
is only 0.52%. Note that in KAF multiwords are
represented both as a single terms and in terms of
their elements. The WSD module assigns synsets
to both. The domain model can thus only add
synsets compared to the processing without the
domain.
Finally, if we look at the named-entity-recogni-
tion module, we see a slight negative effect for
the detection of named-entities due to the domain
model. The named-entity-recognition module
does not consider the elements of multiwords but
just the multiword terms as a whole. Grouping
terms as multiwords thus leads to less named-
entities being detected. This is not necessarily a
bad things, since the detection heavily over-gen-
erates and could have now more precision.

Table 2 shows the effect of inserting ontologic-
al implications into the text representation.For
the benchmark documents, we see that more than
half a million ontological implications have been
inserted. Of these, 82% are implied references,
that are extracted from the explicit ontology on
the basis of a direct mapping to the ontology.
About 8% of the mappings are synset-to-onto-
logy mappings (sc) and 9.5% are mappings rep-
resenting the subclass hierarchy. The differences
between using the domain model and not-using
the domain model are minimal. For the complete
database, the implications are 80 times as much
but the proportions are similar.
Table 3 shows the type of sc-relations that oc-
cur. Obviously, sc_subClassOf and sc_equival-
entOf are the most frequent. Nevertheless, we
still find about 500 mappings that present the
participation in a process or state.

The table clearly shows the impact of role rela-
tions that are encoded in the domain wordnet.
When we extract the mappings for the files
without the domain model (ony using the map-
pings to the generic wordnet), we get only equi-
valence and subclass mappings.
Finally to complete the knowledge cycle, we cre-
ated a few Kybot profiles for extracting events
from the onto-tagged documents. As an initial
test, 3 profiles have been created:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.988809666666667">
1. events of destruction
2. destructions of locations
3. destruction of objects
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.899636379310345">
Using these profiles, we extracted 211 events
from the 3 benchmark documents with 396 roles.
The profiles are created to run over the ontolo-
gical types inserted by the ontotagger, e.g. re-
stricted to events and change_of_integrity. Des-
pite the generality of the profiles, we still see a
clear signature of the domain in the output. This
is a good indication that we will be able to ex-
tract valuable events from the data, even though
the ontotagger generates a massive amount of
implications. Especially events that combine
multiple roles appear to give rich information.
For example, the following sentence:
&amp;quot;One of the greatest challenges to restoration is con-
tinued population growth and development, which
destroys forests, wetlands and other natural areas&amp;quot;
yielded the following output:
&lt;event target=&amp;quot;t1471&amp;quot; lemma=&amp;quot;destroy&amp;quot; pos=&amp;quot;V&amp;quot;
eid=&amp;quot;e74&amp;quot;/&gt;
&lt;role target=&amp;quot;t1477&amp;quot; rtype=&amp;quot;patient&amp;quot; lemma=&amp;quot;area&amp;quot;
pos=&amp;quot;N&amp;quot; event=&amp;quot;e74&amp;quot; rid=&amp;quot;r138&amp;quot;/&gt;
&lt;role target=&amp;quot;t1472&amp;quot; rtype=&amp;quot;patient&amp;quot;
lemma=&amp;quot;forest&amp;quot; pos=&amp;quot;N&amp;quot; event=&amp;quot;e74&amp;quot; rid=&amp;quot;r151&amp;quot;/&gt;
&lt;role target=&amp;quot;t1469&amp;quot; rtype=&amp;quot;actor&amp;quot; lemma=&amp;quot;devel-
opment&amp;quot; pos=&amp;quot;N&amp;quot; event=&amp;quot;e74&amp;quot; rid=&amp;quot;r180&amp;quot;/&gt;
Running the full set of profiles on the complete data-
base with almost 60 million ontological statements
took about 2 hours. This shows that our approach is
scalable and efficient.

In this paper, we described an open platform for
text-mining using wordnets and a central onto-
logy. The system can be used across different
languages and can be tailored to mine any type of
conceptual relations. It can handle semantic im-
plications that are expressed in very different lin-
guistic expressions and yield systematic output.
As future work, we will carry out benchmarking
and testing of the mining of events, both for Eng-
lish and for the other languages in the KYOTO
project.

The KYOTO system uses an open text representation format and a central ontology to enable extraction of knowledge and facts from large volumes of text in many different languages. We implemented a semantic tagging approach that performs off-line reasoning. Mining of facts and knowledge is achieved through a flexible pattern matching module that can work in much the same way for different languages, can handle efficiently large volumes of documents and is not restricted to a specific domain.

Standard IE systems are based on language-specific pattern matching (Kaiser &amp; 1http://www.itl.nist.gov/iad/mig//tests/ace Miksch 2005), where each pattern consists of a regular expression and an associated mapping from syntactic to logical form. In general, the approaches can be categorized into two groups: (1) the Knowledge Engineering approach (Appelt et al.1995), and (2) the learning approach, such as AutoSlog (Appelt et al. 1993), SRV (Freitag 1998), or RAPIER (Califf &amp; R. Mooney 1999). Another important system is GATE (Cunningham et al.2002), which is a platform for creating IE systems. It uses regular expressions, but it can also use ontologies to perform semantic inferences to constrain linguistic patterns semantically. The use of ontologies in IE is an emerging field (Bontcheva &amp; Wilks 2004): linking text instances with elements belonging to the ontology, instead of consulting flat gazetteers. The major disadvantage of traditional IE systems is that they focus on satisfying precise, narrow, pre-specified requests from small homogeneo</context>

The semantic processing involves the detection of named-entities (persons, organizations, places, time-expressions) and determining the meaning of words in the text according to the given wordnet. The output of the linguistic processors is stored in an XML annotation format that is the same for all the languages, called the KYOTO Annotation Format (KAF, Bosma et al 2009). This format incorporates standardized proposals for the linguistic annotation of text and represents them in an easy-to-use layered structure, which is compatible with the Linguistic Annotation Framework (LAF, Ide and Romary 2003). In KAF, words, terms, constituents and syntactic dependencies are stored in separate layers with references across the structures. This makes it easier to harmonize the output of linguistic processors 2 Http://www.kyoto-project.eu for different languages and to add new semantic layers to the basic output, when needed (Bosma et al. 2009, Vossen et al. 2010). All modules in KYOTO draw their input from these structures. In fact, the word-sense disambiguation process is carried out to the same KAF annotation in different languages and is therefore the same for all the languages (Agirre et al. 20</context>
