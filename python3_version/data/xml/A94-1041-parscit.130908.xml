Abstract
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999866785714286">
The AlethGen tool has been used to build a
system for automatically generating replies to
complaints, for a European mail-order company. In
the current version, letters are generated in French.
AlethGen consists of several modules: the text
deep structure planner (or conceptual planner), the
text surface structure planner (or rhetorical planner),
the computation of pronouns and quantifiers, and the
linguistic generator proper (globally inspired by the
Meaning-Text Theory) which determines the
concrete realization of sentences.
The paper mainly describes AlethGen&apos;s
conceptual and rhetorical planners and focuses on
the knowledge they use and produce.

1. Goals and general approach
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999802208333333">
The main function of the texts we had to generate
consisted indeed in replying to a complaint, thus in
arguing and justifying a decision. This implies, on the
one hand, a good management of the argumentative
aspects, and on the other hand, the need to generate
rather complex texts in a perfectly consistent style.
The general approach of the conceptual planning is
relation-based, as described in the Rhetorical Structure
Theory or RST (Mann &amp; Thompson, 1988).
However, as shown in (Elhadad &amp; Mc Keown, 1990),
previous works in text generation systems (including
RST) &amp;quot;have generally used a notion similar to rhetorical
relations to describe the connection between
propositions. They make a one-to-one mapping from
these relations to connectives for generation (for
example, the &amp;quot;opposition&amp;quot; relation would be realized by
the connective &amp;quot;but&amp;quot;). In this approach it is difficult to
distinguish between similar connectives (e.g. 1...] but vs.
although).&amp;quot;
In our work, we assume that there are two different
levels of text structure. The deep level is represented by
unordered basic relations, and the surface level is
represented by (ordered) lists of atomic events and
rhetorical operators.

Dear Sir,
I have received your Minitel message, dated
March 22, 1993, concerning the order of an XXCC disc
and a YYBB software. The disc was sent by post on
February 3, 1993; you should therefore have received it
by now. I will make inquiries to find out what may have
happened.
Unfortunately 1 cannot renew the order, as we
are unable to deliver before the wedding. In your
interest, it would be preferable that I cancel your order.
It will not be refunded as you had decided to pay on
delivery.
Yours faithfully,
</construct>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998538">
In fact, the customer has sent a complaint letter
because he has not received the items he had ordered.
However, he maintains his order provided he receives the
items before his wedding. The items that were sent are
considered lost because of the dates. As the wedding is to
be celebrated soon, it will not be possible to get the items
before that date. The order must therefore be cancelled.
The deep text structure is a list of two trees (in fact
the introduction and the last phrases of the letters are
computed from the input with a trivial system):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.612234666666667">

<bodyText confidence="0.7538604">
condition_fulfillment_impossible,
CONSEQUENCE (
AND (NOT renewal_of the_order,

The surface text structure is a list of events with
rhetorical features and surface operators (note that the
English (human) translation of the letter has a slightly
different surface text structure).

3.1. Rules for conceptual planning
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9431955">
If p and q are events, one can have a rule (cause p
consq q) in the knowledge base. If the input has p &amp; q,
one can generate something like &amp;quot;p caused q&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;q,
because p&amp;quot;. All the possible values are given in the
following table:
p q one can generate
T T &amp;quot;q because p&amp;quot;
F F nothing (does not apply)
F T nothing (does not apply)
T F &amp;quot;—q though p&amp;quot;
The last line is the &amp;quot;exception&amp;quot; to the rule.
Rules can be more complex, and have a condition in
addition to the cause: (cause p cond r consq q). For
example,
cause: addressee_wants_cancel (his order)
cond: not_delivered (the articles have not been...)
consq: cancellation (of the order)
Clearly, not_delivered is not a cause for cancellation
but only a condition, because the reason for cancellation
is addressee_wants_cancel.
</bodyText>
<table confidence="0.986447">
p r , q one can generate
T T T &amp;quot;q because p&amp;quot;
T F T &amp;quot;q because p though —r&amp;quot;

T T F &amp;quot;—q though p&amp;quot;
T F F &amp;quot;—q though p because —r&amp;quot;
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.9739865">
So the knowledge for planning the deep structure of
the text is a set of domain-dependent conceptual rules.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.995835">
3.2. Rhetorical rules
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99787975">
Given a simple relational tree consisting of an
operator as well as two events, it is easy to see that
several surface orders and several surface operators are
possible. For instance, the tree BECAUSE (You ask me
for X, I see to it so that X) may have the following
linguistic realizations:
- I see to it so that X, because you asked me for Y
- You asked me for Y, so I see to it so that X.
The rhetorical module chooses concrete operators,
modalities, and order according to certain attributes, e.g.
the fact that the addressee is aware of an event or not, the
fact that it is in favour of the addressee or not, etc.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.996881" genericHeader="method">
4. Implementation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999830428571429">
The system was written in C++ under Unix and
effectively runs on RS/6000 and Sun SparcStation.
In the current version, there are 130 conceptual rules
for 50 models of events, and 75 rhetorical rules.
In any case, the system generates a whole letter on a
complex problem (15-20 sentences) in less than 2,5
seconds.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.998729" genericHeader="conclusions">
5. Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999993318181818">
The distinction between deep and surface structure of
the text allows the system to generate relevant letters
from an argumentative point of view.
Besides, letters may deal with a rather large number
of various topics (payment of lost or damaged items,
etc.). Our concern was therefore to factor the information
as much as possible, in other words we wanted to make
certain pieces of knowledge portable. For that purpose, it
is interesting here to remind the distinction between
domain knowledge and domain communicative
knowledge (DCK) proposed in (Kittredge and al., 1991).
For example a police crime report and a detective novel
can use the same domain knowledge but the DCK is
quite different. We think that it is preferable to call this
knowledge &amp;quot;Style Dependent Knowledge&amp;quot;, because two
detective novels in two different &amp;quot;domains&amp;quot; (for example
a political murder and a crime of passion) could have the
same style.
In our system, conceptual rules are clearly domain-
dependent. The communicative knowledge used by the
rhetoric module to compute the surface structure of the
text is style-dependent but it is domain-portable.
