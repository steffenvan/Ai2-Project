When a bilingual dictionary with English is avail-
able electronically (as was the case for Romanian,
French, and Spanish), the projection of natural gen-
der labels is done automatically. When such a dic-
tionary is not available in an electronic format, an
English-to-target-language hard-copy dictionary can
be used (this was done for Slovene, with 35 minutes
necessary to extract all the translations of the En-
glish seeds). This first approach is limited to the
languages in which grammatical gender is related to
natural gender. Also, the results may vary according
to the usage of the selected natural gender nouns in
the corpus (for example, words like niece or rooster
may not be very frequent in newswire corpora).
A second, more general approach is to extract from
the corpus a list of nouns selected on the basis of
frequency, number of contexts with which they co-
occur, and suffix patterns, and to label them with
gender information by dictionary look-up. This ap-
proach guarantees that the seeds used are represen-
tative for the given corpus, so that the bootstrap-
ping has a better chance to succeed. On the other
hand, it presumes the existence of a gender anno-
tated mono- or bi-lingual dictionary (which might
be more difficult to find than an unannotated bilin-
gual dictionary). Our goal was to select a small set
(50 or fewer&apos;) of such words in order to minimize the
human supervision required.
The system was initially developed for Roma-
nian. A list of 17,053 nouns were extracted from the
MULTEXT-East Romanian lexicon (Erjavec et al.,
1997). Unfortunately, all neuter nouns are listed as
masculine in this lexicon, probably because morpho-
logically, neuters and masculine are alike in the sin-
gular — for example, copac (tree) is masculine while
conac (mansion) is neuter. Syntactically, neuter sin-
gular nouns occur in the same context as masculine
singular nouns, so the gender agreement cannot be
used to choose between the two class labels.
Only 2,132 of the 17,053 known nouns appear in
the corpus and we focus our attention on these nouns,
as a relevant sample of nouns in the language.
Starting from the English natural-gender words,
seed nouns were obtained by projection using a
scanned and OCRed bilingual Romanian-English
dictionary. One major class of seed candidates were
automatically and systematically eliminated, namely
the multi-gender case where a male and female pair
share the same translation (e.g. the masculine noun

respond to a certain gender for historical reasons, and
this assumption is validated empirically.
2For some corpora, the system may not be able to
extract 50 seeds because of the frequency constraints im-
posed.

copil is a translation of both girl and boy, as well as
daughter and son). All other seeds were retained (in-
cluding poor ones) in order to avoid use of language-
specific knowledge. For example, one of the Roma-
nian seeds, flu (son) is also a very frequent form of
the verb a fi (to be), and therefore many verbal con-
texts are considered by the system from the begin-
ning. One possible approach to correct this problem
is to verify that the seeds extracted from the bilingual
dictionary have only nominal meanings by checking
them individually in a library dictionary. We did
not take this approach, trying to keep the amount of
supervision minimal.

2.5 Treatment of &amp;quot;Unknown&amp;quot; Words
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998678">
We expect that there will still exist some nouns that
are rare and unusual (in terms of morphology) for
which grammatical gender cannot be predicted by
using both the contextual and morphological clues.
In the Romanian test set, there were four such nouns:
the single letters A, B, C, and the word § ah, with 35,
15, 5, and 11 occurrences in the corpus respectively.
One solution is to predict for these nouns the most
common gender in the language. This is not neces-
sarily optimal, because the words corresponding to
the most common gender might have very regular
morphology. A better solution, which we employ,
may be to assign for the uncommon words in terms
of morphology the gender with greater suffix vari-
ability (masculine in Romanian), as in Table 4.

2.6 Evaluation Methods
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999749">
We compute the coverage and accuracy of the sys-
tem considering two estimation methods: type-based
(all nouns are considered equally important and get
a weight of one) and token-based (each prediction is
weighted by the number of occurrences of the tar-
get noun in the corpus). For most languages, we
had at least a main-POS annotated corpus, so that
we could consider only the nominal instances of the
words when computing the token coverage and ac-
curacy. When such information is not available, one
can approximate the token coverage and accuracy by
considering all instances of the word forms from the
noun list in the corpus, regardless their true POS.

This estimation may provide inaccurate results. For
example, if true POS were ignored when comput-
ing token accuracy in Romanian, the accuracy would
be 96.75 instead of 98.25 at 100% coverage, mainly
because of two very frequent words, bine (meaning
good) and cat (meaning quotient, how, and as), never
used with their nominal senses in the corpus.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.950116">
2.7 Further Considerations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999632033333333">
The main problem encountered is the initial cover-
age given by the context bootstrapping phase. The
coverage can be increased by lowering the thresh-
olds for context reliability, but this has the negative
effect of lowering accuracy. The problem occurs pri-
marily because of the size of the corpora used. Thus
we ran the following experiment using Google-based
searches of the largest corpus publicly available: the
Web. Keller et al. (2002) show that the Web can be
used as a reliable general source of lexical and syn-
tactical information using search engines.
When using natural gender seeds, the system finds
two reliable left contexts, un and o, which are the
indefinite articles in Romanian. When using sys-
tem extracted seeds, six left contexts are found: un,
nici un, acest, unui for masculine, o, and nici o for
feminine. We randomly selected 50 nouns from Ro-
manian imposing only the restriction that they are
longer than 5 characters (to reduce the chance of get-
ting results from documents in other languages that
also have those lexical items) and formed queries of
type &amp;quot;masculine-context noun&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;feminine-context
noun&amp;quot; using the reliable contexts found by the sys-
tem. By hypothesizing the gender as the one corre-
sponding to the query with more hits, we obtained
100% accuracy at 94% coverage (the coverage prob-
lem is caused by the rarity of some words as well as
the fact that most Internet texts in Romanian do not
use diacritics in order to be font independent). The
frequencies for 10 such nouns are shown in Table 5.

3 Evaluation on Multiple Languages
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999998">
We chose the following languages both because of
the ground-truth resources available to us and be-
cause they represent three different language families
(Romance, Slavic, and Germanic). Most languages
have characteristic gender systems, so various adjust-
ments of the general system described in this paper
might be necessary. Our purpose has not been to do
such adjustments: all results were obtained by the
same system, with identical methodology of comput-
ing the parameters (considering corpus size, noun list
size, number of occurrences of the known noun word
forms in the corpus), as established for Romanian.

3.1 French

<bodyText confidence="0.9347265">
French is a Romance language that has two gram-
matical genders, masculine and feminine. The re-
sults presented were obtained using 100,000 sen-
tences from the French side of the Hansards, con-
taining 2,767,775 words. We only had a list of 1,488
gender-annotated French nouns. The left contexts
extracted as reliable by the system when starting
with system-extracted seeds are the following: mas-
culine: dernier, bon, ce, quel, nouveau, avant, ex-
cellent, Le, present, grand, le, aucun, meilleur, seul,

3.2 Spanish

Like French, Spanish has two genders, which nor-
mally respect the natural gender for animate beings,
but are semantically arbitrary for inanimate nouns.
The neuter was eliminated historically, usually in fa-
vor of masculine. Most nouns in Spanish (73.5% in
our test data) end in what can be considered a gender
marker: -a for feminine and -o for masculine (Table
2). However, there are exceptions to these conven-
tions, and words with other endings than -o and -a
can correspond to either gender.
The performance of the system in Spanish is pre-
sented in Table 7. We used a newswire corpus of

on-line Spanish-English dictionary.
We were surprised that system performance on
Spanish was worse than for French and Romanian.
The left contexts extracted by the system-seeded
algorithm in the first step were quite reliable (Ul-
tima, Ultimo, misma, buen, una, alguna, nuevo, esa,
ese, Esta, Este, algin, citado, otra, otro, todo, cuyo,
El, esta, este, primer, el, ningiin, ninguna, un) and
would have been expected to yield higher accuracy.
However, Spanish has the rather particular charac-
teristic that masculine determiners are used with
feminine nouns starting with stressed a- or ha-. 13
of the 20 errors by type were made for such nouns
and they further propagated in the morphology step.
This suggests again that there can be language-
specific idiosyncrasies limiting performance.

3.3 Slovene
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999678380952381">
We chose Slovene as a representative for the Slavic
languages (more precisely, South Slavonic) because
of the availability of gender data and corpora from
MULTEXT-East (where, as in Romanian, masculine
and neuter are collapsed) and the IJS-ELAN Slovene
Corpus (Erjavec, 2002).
Four main groups of stems account for three gen-
der classes: -i and -a stems are largely feminine, -o
stems are masculine when followed by a final conso-
nant or neuter when correspond to nouns ending in
-o or -e, consonant stems are mostly neuter.
The absence of definite and indefinite articles in
Slovene poses an additional challenge for the boot-
strapping algorithm, the language missing some of
the most reliable grammatical gender clues. There-
fore, we were not surprised to see that the coverage
obtained when first running the system using nat-
ural gender nouns was very low, as shown in Table
8-a. Starting with system-extracted seeds, the ini-
tial coverage given by contextual clues is better and
the performance is comparable to those for Romance

Swedish is part of the Northern Germanic (Scandi-
navian) group of languages. We extracted a gender-
annotated noun list from the fine-grained-POS anno-
tated (SUC-1). 150 of the nouns were marked both
as neuter and common in the corpus, so they were
eliminated from the list of nouns.
Because Swedish gender does not follow a stan-
dard masculine/feminine distinction, the projection
of the English natural gender nouns (obtained from
www.freedict.com) gives results close to random (Ta-
ble 9-a). This is not necessarily a negative result.
Rather, it shows that the system can not only pre-
dict gender for languages with masculine/feminine
genders but can also identify languages in which the
grammatical gender classes do not follow the natural
gender distinction.
When starting with system-extracted seeds (la-
beled correctly as common or neuter), the results be-
come good, especially for the context-bootstrapping
step. Although Table 2 shows that a word&apos;s last let-
ter alone is not a reliable gender indicator in Swedish,
the variable-length suffix approach seems to handle
the correlation between morphology and gender well.

4 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999988333333333">
This paper has presented a set of algorithms for
the high-accuracy, minimally supervised induction of
grammatical gender. One approach is based on the
translingual projection of natural gender, using only
the translations of 60 words for which natural gen-
der is marked in English. The second approach uses
only a 50 word seed-exemplar set entered from a li-
brary dictionary. Using no other language-specific
knowledge, the presented bootstrapping algorithm
robustly combines both morphological and contex-
tual models to achieve full gender annotation of the
nouns in 5 diverse test languages.

When a bilingual dictionary with English is available electronically (as was the case for Romanian, French, and Spanish), the projection of natural gender labels is done automatically. When such a dictionary is not available in an electronic format, an English-to-target-language hard-copy dictionary can be used (this was done for Slovene, with 35 minutes necessary to extract all the translations of the English seeds). This first approach is limited to the languages in which grammatical gender is related to natural gender. Also, the results may vary according to the usage of the selected natural gender nouns in corpus (for example, words like may not be very frequent in newswire corpora). A second, more general approach is to extract from the corpus a list of nouns selected on the basis of frequency, number of contexts with which they cooccur, and suffix patterns, and to label them with gender information by dictionary look-up. This approach guarantees that the seeds used are representative for the given corpus, so that the bootstrapping has a better chance to succeed. On the other hand, it presumes the existence of a gender annotated monoor bi-lingual dictionary (which might be more difficult to find than an unannotated bilingual dictionary). Our goal was to select a small set (50 or fewer&apos;) of such words in order to minimize the human supervision required. The system was initially developed for Romanian. A list of 17,053 nouns were extracted from the MULTEXT-East Romanian lexicon (Erjavec et al., 1997). Unfortunately, all neuter nouns are listed as masculine in this lexicon, probably because morphologically, neuters and masculine are alike in the sin- — for example, (tree) masculine while (mansion) neuter. Syntactically, neuter singular nouns occur in the same context as masculine singular nouns, so the gender agreement cannot be used to choose between the two class labels. Only 2,132 of the 17,053 known nouns appear in the corpus and we focus our attention on these nouns, as a relevant sample of nouns in the language. Starting from the English natural-gender words, seed nouns were obtained by projection using a scanned and OCRed bilingual Romanian-English dictionary. One major class of seed candidates were automatically and systematically eliminated, namely the multi-gender case where a male and female pair share the same translation (e.g. the masculine noun respond to a certain gender for historical reasons, and this assumption is validated empirically. some corpora, the system may not be able to extract 50 seeds because of the frequency constraints imposed.

For example, one of the Romaseeds, (son) also a very frequent form of verb a fi be), therefore many verbal contexts are considered by the system from the beginning. One possible approach to correct this problem is to verify that the seeds extracted from the bilingual dictionary have only nominal meanings by checking them individually in a library dictionary. We did not take this approach, trying to keep the amount of supervision minimal. 2.2 Evidence Modeling Absolute rather than relative (normalized) frequenare used to capture both the distributional inforfeminine questionable masculine learning Distributions in the nodes: root quest. fem. masc. e Final interpolated distributions: .80 .16 .03 fem masc i .87 .09 .04 n t .89 .06 .05 i r u .84 .03 .12 u d g a i c p r a c a m o .33 .67 .00 .75 .00 .25 .94 .06 .00 1 .00 .00 cutie (F) (M) (F) carne (F) .99 .01 .32 .68 .72 .28 .79 .21 i r 1 .00 .00 ordine (F) .72 .28 .33 .00 .75 .25 .00 ,ratiune (F) imagine (F) .92 .08 .85 .15 Romanian Natural gender seeds (19 fem., 26 masc.) by type by token 2132 nouns context +morph. context +morph. coverage 44.37 100 66.25 100 accuracy 99.79 99.25 99.89 97.90 Romanian System extracted seeds (17 fem., 23 masc.) by type by token 2132 nouns context +morph. context +morph. coverage 48.26 100 70.10 100 accuracy 99.81 99.44 99.90 98.25 Table 3: Results for Romanian Romanian French Spanish Slovene Swedish unk 0.19% 0.08% 0.03% 0.46% 0.09% M.L. 0 0 100 41.18 100 100 100 90.00 41.18 Table 4: Percentage of nouns for which predictions canmade and the accuracy obtained for these nouns by predicting the most likely class (M.L.) and the class with most endings (M.V.) in the language 2.5 Treatment of &amp;quot;Unknown&amp;quot; Words We expect that there will still exist some nouns that are rare and unusual (in terms of morphology) for which grammatical gender cannot be predicted by using both the contextual and morphological clues. In the Romanian test set, there were four such nouns: single letters A, C, the word § 35, 15, 5, and 11 occurrences in the corpus respectively. One solution is to predict for these nouns the most common gender in the language. This is not necessarily optimal, because the words corresponding to the most common gender might have very regular morphology. A better solution, which we employ, may be to assign for the uncommon words in terms of morphology the gender with greater suffix variability (masculine in Romanian), as in Table 4. 2.6 Evaluation Methods We compute the coverage and accuracy of the system considering two estimation methods: type-based (all nouns are considered equally important and get a weight of one) and token-based (each prediction is weighted by the number of occurrences of the target noun in the corpus). For most languages, we had at least a main-POS annotated corpus, so that we could consider only the nominal instances of the words when computing the token coverage and accuracy. When such information is not available, one can approximate the token coverage and accuracy by considering all instances of the word forms from the noun list in the corpus, regardless their true POS.

For example, if true POS were ignored when computing token accuracy in Romanian, the accuracy would be 96.75 instead of 98.25 at 100% coverage, mainly of two very frequent words, how, used with their nominal senses in the corpus. 2.7 Further Considerations The main problem encountered is the initial coverage given by the context bootstrapping phase. The coverage can be increased by lowering the thresholds for context reliability, but this has the negative effect of lowering accuracy. The problem occurs primarily because of the size of the corpora used. Thus we ran the following experiment using Google-based searches of the largest corpus publicly available: the Web. Keller et al. (2002) show that the Web can be used as a reliable general source of lexical and syntactical information using search engines. When using natural gender seeds, the system finds reliable left contexts, are the indefinite articles in Romanian. When using sysextracted seeds, six left contexts are found: un, acest, unui masculine, o, and o feminine. We randomly selected 50 nouns from Romanian imposing only the restriction that they are longer than 5 characters (to reduce the chance of getting results from documents in other languages that also have those lexical items) and formed queries of type &amp;quot;masculine-context noun&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;feminine-context noun&amp;quot; using the reliable contexts found by the system. By hypothesizing the gender as the one corresponding to the query with more hits, we obtained 100% accuracy at 94% coverage (the coverage problem is caused by the rarity of some words as well as the fact that most Internet texts in Romanian do not use diacritics in order to be font independent). The frequencies for 10 such nouns are shown in Table 5.

Most languages have characteristic gender systems, so various adjustments of the general system described in this paper might be necessary. Our purpose has not been to do such adjustments: all results were obtained by the same system, with identical methodology of computing the parameters (considering corpus size, noun list size, number of occurrences of the known noun word forms in the corpus), as established for Romanian. 3.1 French French is a Romance language that has two grammatical genders, masculine and feminine. The results presented were obtained using 100,000 sentences from the French side of the Hansards, containing 2,767,775 words. We only had a list of 1,488 gender-annotated French nouns. The left contexts extracted as reliable by the system when starting with system-extracted seeds are the following: masbon, ce, quel, nouveau, avant, excellent, Le, present, grand, le, aucun, meilleur, seul, premier, certain, un; auquelle, telle, toute, grande, bonne, sa, 3.2 Spanish Like French, Spanish has two genders, which normally respect the natural gender for animate beings, but are semantically arbitrary for inanimate nouns. The neuter was eliminated historically, usually in favor of masculine. Most nouns in Spanish (73.5% in our test data) end in what can be considered a gender -a for feminine and masculine (Table 2). However, there are exceptions to these convenand words with other endings than -a can correspond to either gender. The performance of the system in Spanish is presented in Table 7. We used a newswire corpus of Spanish Natural gender seeds (53 fem., 51 masc.) by type by token 2993 nouns context +morph. context +morph. coverage 54.06 100 72.71 100 accuracy 98.70 95.59 99.47 98.45 Spanish System extracted seeds (18 fem., 30 masc.) by type by token 2993 nouns context +morph. context +morph. coverage 50.84 100 77.33 100 accuracy 98.69 95.49 99.51 98.13 7: for Spanish 12,258 sentences accounting for a total of 369,136 words, and a list of 16,302 nouns extracted from an on-line Spanish-English dictionary. We were surprised that system performance on Spanish was worse than for French and Romanian. The left contexts extracted by the system-seeded in the first step were quite reliable (Ultima, Ultimo, misma, buen, una, alguna, nuevo, esa, ese, Esta, Este, algin, citado, otra, otro, todo, cuyo, esta, este, primer, el, ningiin, ninguna, un) would have been expected to yield higher accuracy. However, Spanish has the rather particular characteristic that masculine determiners are used with nouns starting with stressed aor of the 20 errors by type were made for such nouns and they further propagated in the morphology step. This suggests again that there can be languagespecific idiosyncrasies limiting performance. 3.3 Slovene We chose Slovene as a representative for the Slavic languages (more precisely, South Slavonic) because of the availability of gender data and corpora from MULTEXT-East (where, as in Romanian, masculine and neuter are collapsed) and the IJS-ELAN Slovene Corpus (Erjavec, 2002). Four main groups of stems account for three genclasses: -i and -a stems are largely feminine, stems are masculine when followed by a final consonant or neuter when correspond to nouns ending in stems are mostly neuter. The absence of definite and indefinite articles in Slovene poses an additional challenge for the bootstrapping algorithm, the language missing some of the most reliable grammatical gender clues. Therefore, we were not surprised to see that the coverage obtained when first running the system using natural gender nouns was very low, as shown in Table 8-a. Starting with system-extracted seeds, the initial coverage given by contextual clues is better and the performance is comparable to those for Romance Slovene Natural gender seeds (44 fern., 40 masc.) by type by token 2170 nouns context +morph. context +morph. coverage 2.26 100 3.64 100 accuracy 100 90.60 100 78.32 Slovene System extracted seeds (27 fern., 19 masc.) by type by token 2170 nouns context +morph. context +morph. coverage 18.99 100 64.86 100 accuracy 99.51 95.62 98.18 96.71 Results for Slovene Swedish gender seeds (38 41 by type by token 19877 nouns context +morph. context +morph. coverage 0.30 100 1.81 100 accuracy 44.07 46.21 46.21 45.92 Swedish System extracted seeds (27 comm., 23 neut.) by type by token 19877 nouns context +morph. context +morph. coverage 35.61 100 72.73 100 accuracy 98.84 94.41 99.62 96.50 9: for Swedish languages, as shown in Table 8-b. 3.4 Swedish Swedish is part of the Northern Germanic (Scandinavian) group of languages. We extracted a genderannotated noun list from the fine-grained-POS annotated (SUC-1). 150 of the nouns were marked both as neuter and common in the corpus, so they were eliminated from the list of nouns. Because Swedish gender does not follow a standard masculine/feminine distinction, the projection of the English natural gender nouns (obtained from www.freedict.com) gives results close to random (Table 9-a). This is not necessarily a negative result. Rather, it shows that the system can not only predict gender for languages with masculine/feminine genders but can also identify languages in which the grammatical gender classes do not follow the natural gender distinction. When starting with system-extracted seeds (labeled correctly as common or neuter), the results become good, especially for the context-bootstrapping step. Although Table 2 shows that a word&apos;s last letter alone is not a reliable gender indicator in Swedish, the variable-length suffix approach seems to handle the correlation between morphology and gender well. 4 Conclusion This paper has presented a set of algorithms for the high-accuracy, minimally supervised induction of grammatical gender. One approach is based on the translingual projection of natural gender, using only the translations of 60 words for which natural gender is marked in English. The second approach uses only a 50 word seed-exemplar set entered from a library dictionary. Using no other language-specific knowledge, the presented bootstrapping algorithm robustly combines both morphological and contextual models to achieve full gender annotation of the nouns in 5 diverse test languages.
