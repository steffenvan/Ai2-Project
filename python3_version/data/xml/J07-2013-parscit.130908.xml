Understanding language is one of the great challenges of science, and language-
related technology is one of the great opportunities of Information Technology. Con-
sequently, many different kinds of researchers work on language issues. Within the
computer science community, language is studied by the “ACL community,” by which
I mean researchers who regularly publish in Association for Computational Linguistics
(ACL) venues, such as the journal Computational Linguistics and ACL conferences. But
language-related research is also carried out by researchers in other areas of computer
science, including knowledge representation, cognitive modeling, vision and robotics,
and human–computer interaction communities. Additionally, there are even more peo-
ple outside computer science who study language, including linguists, psycholinguists,
philosophers, and sociolinguists.
This is fine; understanding language and developing language technology are
huge problems, and it is very useful to have many research communities from diverse
backgrounds working on language. This will be especially true if the different research
communities are aware of each other, so they can share insights, observations, problems,
and so forth.
Unfortunately, my impression is that the ACL community is much less interested
in research with other language-related research communities than it used to be. This
impression is mostly based on discussions I have had with researchers who are on the
border between ACL and another language-research community. Several such people
have told me that whereas ten years ago they occasionally submitted papers to ACL
venues and attended ACL conferences, now they do not bother, because they believe
that the ACL community has no interest in their research.
In attempt to quantify this insight, I have analyzed citations from papers published
in Computational Linguistics in 1995 and in 2005. Specifically, I extracted all citations from
Computational Linguistics (CL) articles (excluding book reviews) in these years to journal
papers. I then classified the cited journal papers into one of the categories shown in
Table 1; whenever possible this classification was based on the subject category assigned
by ISI Journal Citation Reports (JCR) to the cited journal. For example, a citation of a
paper in Cognitive Science would count as a psychology citation, since ISI JCR classifies
Cognitive Science as “Psychology, Experimental.” I counted citations myself, rather than
relying on ISI JCR’s count, as there were some mistakes in JCR’s counting. I also created
my own “other NLP and speech” classification (that is, references to speech and NLP

journals other than Computational Linguistics), as there is no such category in ISI JCR.
This includes journals such as Computer Speech and Language, Natural Language Engi-
neering, and IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing. I did not look at citations
to workshops or conference papers, partly in order to simplify the analysis task, and
partly because I am not aware of an independent subject classification of conferences
and workshops similar to ISI JCR’s journal classifications. I suspect that the main effect
of including conference and workshop citations would be to decrease the percentage
of citations to non-CS areas (psychology, linguistics, mathematics, other), because CS
researchers are much more likely to publish important findings in conferences than
researchers in other disciplines.
Table 1 shows the numbers of citations from CL papers to journals in differ-
ent subject areas. It also shows the number of citations to papers that are less than
ten years old; this gives us an idea as to whether CL authors are influenced by recent
work in other areas. I draw the following conclusions from this table:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.997913333333333">
• CL authors were generally more inward looking in 2005 than in 1995; 53%
of journal citations in 2005 were to NLP and speech journals, compared to
only 35% in 1995.
• CL authors were much less likely to cite psychology and HCI journals in
2005 than in 1995: 1% of citations in 2005, compared to 15% in 1995.
• CL authors were less likely to cite recent work in linguistics and journals in
2005 than in 1995: 5% of recent citations in 2005, compared to 13% in 1995.
• CL authors were more likely to cite mathematical and statistical journals in
2005 than in 1995: 10% of citations in 2005, compared to 3% in 1995.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9994282">
In short, 2005 CL authors were much less influenced by other research communities
investigating language than 1995 CL authors. I find the steep drop in citations of
psychology research to be especially surprising, as the past ten years has seen great
progress made in psychology and psycholinguistics, partially driven by more wide-
spread availability of new technology such as eye trackers and brain scanners.

I also looked at citations from 2005 papers published in Natural Language Engineer-
ing, which is another journal in which I believe many members of the ACL community
publish. The citation pattern from 2005 NLE papers is overall quite similar to the citation
pattern from 2005 CL papers. In particular, looking at references to other language
research communities, 2005 NLE papers have a few more references than 2005 CL
papers to papers in psychology journals (3% vs. 1%) and HCI journals (2% vs. 0%),
but on the other hand have fewer references to papers in linguistic journals (5% vs.
8%). I could not examine citations from NLE papers in 1995, as the journal did not
exist then.
I have not analyzed papers in ACL conferences in this way, but certainly my
impression is that the situation here is similar, and that most ACL conference papers
do not make many references to papers from other language research communities.

Does this matter? The ACL community seems to be focusing more on specific niches
of the “language research” space, such as low-level syntactic analyses based on sta-
tistical corpus-based techniques. This is certainly an important niche, and progress
in it will benefit the larger language community; so perhaps the ACL community is
right to ignore the larger community and focus on making progress in its specific
niches?
This is a logically defensible position, but I for one feel that it is a mistake, and
in particular such a focus makes ACL conferences and Computational Linguistics less
intellectually exciting and vigorous. This inward focus also goes against the belief in
the larger scientific community that we need more inter-disciplinary work, and more
interaction between researchers coming from different backgrounds.
The lack of references from papers published in ACL venues to work in the
broader language community also decreases the awareness of the broader community
in ACL research. This is because many researchers track references to their papers
using citation-tracking services such as Google Scholar. Hence a side effect of researcher
A citing researcher B is that researcher B is likely to become aware of researcher
A’s work.
I am also disappointed that Computational Linguistics and ACL conferences do
not publish a broader range of papers on “problems involving natural language and
computation” (especially as the ACL Web site states that ACL is “the international
scientific and professional society for people working on problems involving nat-
ural language and computation”). In Table 2, I list recent language-related articles
published in Artificial Intelligence (which is the most prestigious general AI journal).
These articles address topics that I rarely see in ACL venues these days (but which
I did see 10–20 years ago), such as user modeling, knowledge representation, inte-
gration of linguistic and visual information, and computational cognitive modeling.
These articles, incidentally, have a very different citation pattern from Computational
Linguistics papers (Table 1); only 11% of journal citations are to NLP and speech
journals, whereas 31% are to AI journals, and 25% (!!) are to psychology journals. In
other words, language-related papers published in Artificial Intelligence (unlike papers
in Computational Linguistics) show considerable awareness of the broader language
research community.
The last eight articles in Table 2, in fact, appeared in a special issue on Connecting
Language to the World, which I co-edited (Roy and Reiter 2005). When I organized this

special issue, I originally suggested having it in Computational Linguistics, but I switched
to Artificial Intelligence because many potential authors told me that they had no interest
in publishing in Computational Linguistics, because it was not a journal that they and
their research colleagues read. In other words, they did not see Computational Linguistics
as a venue that published papers about their kind of research.

If this is indeed a problem, what can be done about it? I believe that one useful initial
step would be to broaden the range of papers in ACL conferences and Computational
Linguistics (I believe that many ACL members would like this to happen in any case).
This could be done by making the paper-reviewing process less conservative (Church
2005); by putting more emphasis on the poster track and less on the full-paper track
at ACL conferences (because the poster track tends to be broader than the full-paper
track); and by including a broader range of people in journal editorial boards and
conference program committees.
Another useful step would be to include a broader range of workshops, tutorials,
and invited talks at ACL conferences and survey articles in Computational Linguistics on
other areas of language-related research (I was very pleased to see a recent announce-
ment that CL intended to publish such articles).

I believe that such measures are worth trying, because both the ACL community
and the language-research community in general would benefit if the ACL community
took more interest in the broader community, as indeed it did ten years ago.
