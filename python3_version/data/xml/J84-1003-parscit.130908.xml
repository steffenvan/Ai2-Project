To understand the field of computer speech fully re-
quires an interdisciplinary approach which probably
spans acoustics, computer science, electrical engineer-
ing, linguistics, phonetics, phonology, and psychology.
The most one can hope for from a single author is a
comprehensive overview with pointers to sources with
more depth and a clear presentation of some funda-
mental issues. These tasks are made much more diffi-
cult by a field that is literally exploding. On the
whole, I think the author of Principles of Computer
Speech, Ian H. Witten, has done a very credible job
of reviewing the state of the art in 1980. His treat-
ment is somewhat uneven and (obviously!) does not
cover some important work done since the book was
written. This review outlines a few criticisms, but
mainly it attempts to help the reader of Principles of
Computer Speech know where to look to fill in the
gaps. On the whole, I do recommend the book as an
introduction to the topic. It does cover most of the
relevant fields and is clearly written.
The author&apos;s expertise seems to be more in the area
of engineering than linguistics and more in linguistics
than in psychology. The reader needs to keep this and
a few consequent corollaries in mind while reading the
book. For instance, the author (as is common prac-
tice!) talks about algorithms whose purpose is to deter-
mine fundamental frequency as &amp;quot;pitch trackers&amp;quot;. This
is common parlance, but is nonetheless misleading.
Pitch is psychological; that is, a perceptual quantity
that is primarily related to fundamental frequency but
is also related to a number of other things.
One example of the sometimes tenuous relationship
between pitch and fundamental frequency may illus-
trate the point. Because of the anatomical linkage
between the tongue and the pharynx, high vowels like
&amp;quot;ee&amp;quot; in &amp;quot;beet&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;uu&amp;quot; in &amp;quot;dude&amp;quot; are more easily
made with higher fundamental frequency, at least in
English. If one does not make this correction in syn-
thetic speech, &amp;quot;ee&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;uu&amp;quot; may sound &amp;quot;lower
pitched&amp;quot; than an &amp;quot;ah&amp;quot; vowel with exactly the same
fundamental frequency. Thus, pitch (a perceptual
event) depends upon expectations based on experi-
ence. One could easily infer from Principles of Com-
puter Speech that pitch and FO are synonymous.
In the index, we find the curious entry &amp;quot;Loudness,
See Amplitude.&amp;quot; Here again, it seems, there is some
confusion. Amplitude is a physical attribute that is the
main correlate of perceived loudness, but by no means
the only one, particularly for speech. At least there
are the effects of frequency, contrast, and expectation.
These effects are more than laboratory demonstrations
with strange stimuli. They play a part in the percep-
tion of synthetic (and natural) speech. For example,
there are typical relations in amplitude between vari-
ous phonemes; for example, the &amp;quot;ah&amp;quot; vowel in
&amp;quot;father&amp;quot; is typically of greater amplitude than the &amp;quot;u&amp;quot;
in &amp;quot;soon&amp;quot;. If one matches these vowels in amplitude,
the &amp;quot;u&amp;quot; in &amp;quot;soon&amp;quot; will sound much too loud.
While there is a chapter devoted to articulation and
how sounds are produced, the real point of synthetic
speech is to obtain sounds that are perceived as speech.
In order to do this, it helps to have some understand-
ing of how the ear-brain system works. This forms a
foundation for deciding on the proper granularity of
various parameters, although some trial and error will
still be required. The problem may be deeper than
simply not having a special chapter on hearing in the
book. I believe that there is an underlying assumption
here that mathematical formulae are a sufficient basis
for making decisions about how to produce synthetic
speech.
This philosophy is common in engineering circles
and was perhaps best (worst) typified at a recent
ICASSP meeting where someone gave a paper that
&amp;quot;proved&amp;quot; that their noise reduction technique was
superior to the Weiner technique even though (at
least) this listener could clearly make out the speech
whose noise had been damped by a Weiner technique
while the author&apos;s technique made the speech totally
unintelligible!!
We would all like to advance science to the point
where mathematical models would be better represen-
tations of what actually happens in perception, but the
fact is that we are not yet there. Where psychophysics
has advanced and we have better representations of
the relationship between objective and subjective
scales (as in critical bands and the bark scale), the
author has failed to inform the reader of these ad-
vances.
While the prose parts of the text are very clearly
written, I find the diagrams and mathematics some-
what harder to follow. The mathematical treatments
are not in depth enough for me to simply &amp;quot;use&amp;quot; the
formulae. Nor are there enough steps in most of the
derivations to allow me to follow the logic closely. To
someone with the right engineering background, they
may well be useful as reminders of well-known results.
I think that for the typical linguistics or computer sci-
ence reader, even with a few years of calculus, the

Book Review Principles of Computer Speech
treatment will not be sufficient to allow them to gain
any real insight into the theory over and above what is
presented in the (clearly written) text.
While the book offers a good discussion of many of
the major issues in speech coding and synthesis, the
reader should supplement his/her study by referring to
more recent works. For instance, a number of com-
mercial synthesizers that do a fairly credible job of
unlimited text-to-speech conversion have come on the
market since the book was written. These are based
primarily on the work of Gunnar Fant and/or Dennis
Klatt. The interested reader can typically see demon-
strations of such devices at meetings of AVIOS
(American Voice Input Output Society), ASA
(Acoustical Society of America), or ICASSP
(International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and
Signal Processing).
In addition, some advances have been made in
speech coding techniques, including Time Domain
Harmonic Scaling and &amp;quot;Multipulse&amp;quot; (Malah 1979; Atal
1983; Singhal and Atal 1984). Applications of speech
synthesis are expanding also. Speech synthesis is be-
ing used in special telephones, more widely in manu-
facturing, for remote sensing, and for access to com-
puters via touch-tone phones.
A number of relevant human factors studies have
also been carried out very recently. The development
of IBM&apos;s Audio Distribution System was heavily influ-
enced by human factor considerations (Richards and
Boies 1981; Thomas 1983; Gould and Boies 1984).
In addition, numerous studies on the perception of
synthetic speech have been carried out in David
Pisoni&apos;s lab at Indiana (Pisoni 1982; Nusbaum,
Schwab, and Pisoni 1984) as well as in other places
(Jenkins and Franklin 1982; McPeters and Tharp
1984; Thomas, Rosson, Chodorow, Kluender, and
Carr 1984).
There appear to be very large individual differences
in the ability to perceive synthetic speech. The intelli-
gibility also varies tremendously as a function of how
predictable the materials are. (A fact that demonstra-
tors of synthetic speech materials use to their advan-
tage!!) In addition, it appears that even when synthetic
speech is perceived correctly, it requires more atten-
tional demands than natural speech. Adaptation ef-
fects are quite substantial. There are both specific and
general learning effects. All these factors mean that if
one is interested in using synthetic speech in a real
application, a little &amp;quot;demo&amp;quot; of the application that
seems nice to the developers falls far short of the test-
ing required to see whether or not the application will
be useful in the real world.

Applications of speech synthesis are expanding also. Speech synthesis is being used in special telephones, more widely in manufacturing, for remote sensing, and for access to computers via touch-tone phones. A number of relevant human factors studies have also been carried out very recently. The development of IBM&apos;s Audio Distribution System was heavily influenced by human factor considerations (Richards and Boies 1981; Thomas 1983; Gould and Boies 1984). In addition, numerous studies on the perception of synthetic speech have been carried out in David Pisoni&apos;s lab at Indiana (Pisoni 1982; Nusbaum, Schwab, and Pisoni 1984) as well as in other places (Jenkins and Franklin 1982; McPeters and Tharp 1984; Thomas, Rosson, Chodorow, Kluender, and Carr 1984). There appear to be very large individual differences in the ability to perceive synthetic speech. The intelligibility also varies tremendously as a function of how predictable the materials are. (A fact that demonstrators of synthetic speech materials use to their advanta</context>
