<bodyText confidence="0.999943636363636">
Over the past decade or so, a lot of work
in computational linguistics has been
directed at finding ways to exploit the
ever increasing volume of electronic
bilingual corpora. These efforts have
allowed for substantial expansion of the
computational toolbox. We describe a
system, TransCheck, which makes
intensive use of these new tools in order
to detect potential translation errors in
preliminary or non-revised translations.

Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999963541666667">
For the sake of argument, let&apos;s consider a
translator to be a black box with source text
in and target text out. We feed that box with
texts and, to be really tricky, we input the
same text a couple of times. Looking at the
results, the first thing we notice is that
though the different translations are quite
similar, they&apos;re not exactly the same.
Nothing to worry about, this may simply
exemplify the potential for synonymy and
paraphrase. But let&apos;s further suppose the text
to translate is too big for one individual to
translate in the given time frame. In realistic
conditions, such a text would be split among
perhaps half a dozen translators, each with
his own vocabulary, experience and stylistic
preferences, which would normally lead to
the well known problem of non-uniformity
of the translation.
It is therefore part of the normal
translation process to have a reviser look at a
translator&apos;s output. His job will be to spot
any typos (taken in a very broad sense to
include missing chapters!). Usually, at this
point the translator probably has submitted
the preliminary version to a spell checker, so
what could be done automatically at that
level has already been done. No automatic
detection of typical translation mistakes has
been attempted though. That&apos;s the gap
TransCheck is designed to fill. The concept
of a &amp;quot;translation checker&amp;quot; was initially
proposed in Isabelle and al. [8] and
eventually led to a demonstration prototype
concerned with the detection of a very
restricted type of mistake: deceptive
cognates. In comparison, the system
described in this paper goes much further
toward a &amp;quot;real &amp;quot; usable translation checker
by allowing for the detection of errors of
omission, the comparison of diverse
numerical expressions and the flagging of
inconsistent terminology.
On the interface side, it allows for the
automatic alignment of the source and target
texts, the flagging of potential mistakes and
the possibility of saving any modifications
made to the target text.

<bodyText confidence="0.999902222222222">
Complete automatic modelling of the
translation process is still far beyond our
technical ability. The same is true of our
ability to detect all types of translation
mistakes. We can however, for certain well-
defined sub-types of mistake, devise specific
mechanisms. And if a program capable of
detecting all mistakes of translation would
undoubtedly be extremely useful, so would
</bodyText>

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999847076923077">
one capable of detecting frequent mistakes,
especially when time is short and a thorough
revision isn&apos;t possible. Errors are then bound
to escape the reviser&apos;s attention from time to
time. This will not necessary be the case of
an &amp;quot;automatic reviser&amp;quot;, though. In that
respect, we can compare TransCheck&apos;s
behaviour to the familiar &amp;quot;find and replace&amp;quot;
now common to every text editors. Who
would know consider doing that particular
task by hand? We now give a short
description of those sub-problems
TransCheck is addressing.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999687">
1.1 Errors of omission
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99977225">
The ability to automatically detect
unintended errors of omission would be
much valued, as they can prove quite
embarrassing to the translator. Yet a
diversity of situations can lead to such errors
among which translator&apos;s fatigue and the
accidental pressing of a key in a text editor,
as was pointed out by Melamed [12].
Unfortunately, detecting an omission is far
from being simple when taken in all its
generality (from omission of single words to
whole chapters). This is due in part to the
fact that one language may express some
ideas with a greater economy of means than
another, so length difference alone isn&apos;t
sufficient to identify omitted text. Consider:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9913244">
• French: Quant a la section 5, elle foul-nit les
resultats de nos simulations, que suit notre
conclusion, a la sixieme et derniere section.
• English: Section 5 describes our simulation
results and the final section concludes.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9974188">
Excluding punctuation, the French sentence
in the example above has twice as many
words as its English counterpart. Yet there&apos;s
nothing wrong with the French translation.
The task is therefore to determine whether
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.799016">
or not correspondence at the word level is
scattered throughout the whole aligned
segment. Word alignment in general tends to
be rather fuzzy though, as the following
example shows:
• French: Voici le plan du document.
Literal translation: (Here&apos;s) (the) (plan) (of
the) (document)
• English: The paper is organized as follows.
Literal translation: (Le) (papier) (est)
(organise) (comme) (suit)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9981311">
Independently of the exact method used,
alignment at the word level for this pair of
sentences would prove to be rather weak. It
should be noted however that the above
examples are extreme cases and, without
being extremely rare, they aren&apos;t exactly
typical either. They&apos;re still a reminder that
small omissions are unlikely to be detected
with sufficient precision considering the
methods available to TransCheck.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.977342">
1.2 Normative usage of words
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999978785714286">
Entire repositories of usage mistakes and
other linguistic difficulties of translation
from English to French have been written to
help language professionals become aware
of them (Colpron [3], Dagenais [5], De
Villiers [6], Rey [14], Van Roey and al.
[17]). Unfortunately, those books are only
useful to confirm existing suspicions. To
warn the unsuspecting translator,
TransCheck incorporates a repository of that
nature.
What&apos;s particular about some of these
words, and of interest for an automatic
reviser, is that they cannot be detected by a
simple dictionary lookup, for they do appear
in a monolingual dictionary. What&apos;s wrong
isn&apos;t the words themselves but the context in
which they are used. Consider, for example,
the English word definitely (en effet)
together with the French definitivement (for
good, once and for all). Though very similar
in form, and both acceptable adverbs in their
respective languages, they simply do not
mean the same thing. TransCheck, therefore,
looks through aligned pairs of sentences for
such forbidden word pairs. It also looks for
other types of mistakes, for example
calques, which could potentially be detected
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.996496">
128
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.82249625">
by a complex dictionary lookup. Calques
consist of sequences of legitimate words that
incorrectly mimic the structure of the other
language by being sort of literal translations.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.995996">
1.3 Numerical expressions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999817541666667">
A variety of phenomena can be found under
this heading (telephone numbers,
percentages, fractions, etc.). One important
point these otherwise very diverse types of
constructions have in common is that, being
open sets, they cannot be listed in
repositories. Therefore, their detection will
require the use of grammatical tools of some
sort. But identification is not enough in most
cases. Having simply identified &amp;quot;2&amp;quot; in one
text and &amp;quot;two&amp;quot; in the other will not alone
permit their comparison. Conversion toward
a common form is required. Part of this
normalised form must also indicate the type
of phenomenon observed. This is so
because, though there is a 6 underlying the
ordinal sixth, only alignment with an other
ordinal of the same value could be
considered an appropriate match. In
TransCheck, recognition, normalisation and
phenomenon identification of numerical
expressions are done through appropriate
transducers as will be shown in the next
section.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997696">
1.4 Terminological coherence
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999673863636363">
It&apos;s not rare for two or more terms to refer to
the same concept. However, all things being
equal, it&apos;s generally taken to be bad practice
to use more than one of the synonyms for
technical terms in a given translation.
Failure to follow this is referred to as
terminological inconsistency. To try and
minimise this problem, each translator
working on a project is given specific
instructions that involve standardising
terminology. Unfortunately, it&apos;s not rare for
some translators to ignore these instructions
or even for these instructions never to reach
the translator. Inadequacies are therefore to
be expected, and the bigger the project the
more so. As an example, given the term air
bag and possible translations sac gonflable
and coussin gonflable (literally, inflatable
bag/cushion), it shouldn&apos;t be allowed for
both forms to appear in a given translation,
though either one of the two could actually
appear.

2 Tracking mistakes
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9988382">
We have presented briefly the type of errors
detection TransCheck seeks to accomplish
automatically. We will now see in more
details how they are currently being
implemented.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.955653">
2.1 Prerequisites
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997560666666667">
In order for TransCheck to detect potential
translation errors, a relatively impressive set
of mechanisms is required. These include:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.990036545454545">
1. An aligner. After identification of word
and sentence boundaries the text is
processed into a bi-text by an alignment
program. This alignment is done on the
basis of both length (Gale and Church
[7]) and a notion of cognateness (Simard
[16]).
2. Transducers. In order to compare
numerical expressions, which often
diverge in format between given pairs of
languages, normalisation toward a
common format is required. This is done
with transducers (Kaplan and Kay, [10]).
3. Part-of-speech tagger. Misleading
similarities in graphical form can
sometime induce translation mistakes
(deceptive cognates)) These forbidden
pairs normally involve only one of
several possible parts of speech, hence
the need to disambiguate them. We do
this with a first-order HMM part-of-
speech tagger (Merialdo [13]).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.315322333333333">
I In the rest of the paper, we will use deceptive
cognate very losely often to refer to normative usage
of word in general.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.982507">
129
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.969711625">
4. Translation models. Being robust, the
alignment program will align a pair of
texts regardless of possible omissions in
the target text. To detect such omissions
of text, a probabilistic bilingual
dictionary is called upon. This dictionary
was estimated along the line of Brown
and al.&apos;s first translation model [2]. It is
used to align (coarsely) at the word
level.
In what follows, we assume the reader to be
at least remotely familiar with most of these
mechanisms. We will however go into more
technical details concerning the transducers
considering the central role they play in
TransCheck.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997699">
2.2 Identifying omissions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999838685714286">
Grammatical correctors greatly relies on
complex grammars to identify &amp;quot;typical&amp;quot;
mistakes. We could imagine doing
something similar for omission detection
trying to construct the meaning of every
sentences in a text and then &amp;quot;flag&amp;quot; those
where semantic discontinuity were found,
not unlike what a human would do. This is,
of course, in our wildest dreams as, semantic
analyses still remain to this day extremely
elusive. Not only that, but unlike
grammatical errors, we cannot anticipate
something like a &amp;quot;typical&amp;quot; omission as they
will appear randomly and span over any
possible length of text. We must therefore
recast what appears as a semantic problem
in terms of more readily accessible data. The
basic idea here is to assimilate an omission
to a particular type of alignment where an
important contiguous set of words present in
the source text cannot be aligned at the word
level with the target text. For this we rely on
mechanisms similar to those described in
Russell [15].
We can distinguish between small (a
couple of sentences) and big omissions (any
thing bigger than a few paragraphs). One
might expect the detection of whole missing
pages and chapters not to be difficult, but
that&apos;s not necessarily true, as the burden of
the problem then falls on the aligning
program instead of the checker per se.
Robustness here is the key-word since an
alignment program that couldn&apos;t fall back on
its feet after seeing big chunks of missing
text would cause TransCheck to output only
noise thereafter. The alignment program we
use is one such robust program which, as a
first step, seeks to approximate the real
alignment by drawing lines in regions with
high densities of cognate words. Since the
distribution of cognates is a priori uniform
throughout the text, omitted sections, when
big enough, will show up on the appropriate
graph as an important discontinuity in those
approximation lines. As the omissions
become smaller and smaller, however, the
cognate&apos;s uniform distribution hypothesis
becomes increasingly questionable.2
Still, we are interested in detecting
missing sentences with acceptable precision.
Ideally, this should be reflected as an X to
zero alignment, but alignment programs tend
to associate a high penalty to these cases,
preferring to distribute extra text on adjacent
regions. In order to recover from these
mergings, TransCheck takes a closer look at
pairs of aligned texts whenever the length
ratio between source and target text falls
under a certain threshold. It then attempts to
aligned those pairs at the word level using a
probabilistic bilingual dictionary that was
estimated on the Canadian Hansard.
The &amp;quot;Art&amp;quot; of omission detection can be
seen as one of trial and error in adjusting
precision and recall by choosing appropriate
values for what will constitute a significant
difference in length ratio, a significant span
of words that can&apos;t be aligned, and the
penalty to be imposed if some words

accidentally align due to the imprecision of
the word to word alignment algorithm.
As we have just seen, the problem of
detecting a missing portion of text is, in
TransCheck, closely related to that of
alignment, as it can be reduced to a
misalignment at the word level. All the other
types of errors TransCheck is concerned
with are different in that respect. Correct
alignment is presupposed, and when given
specific pairs of aligned &amp;quot;tokens&amp;quot; the task
will be to decide whether they represent
valid translations. We now present the steps
involved in this evaluation.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.976185">
2.3 Identification
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999998208333333">
In order for TransCheck to evaluate a
translation pair, their constitutive elements
must first be identified. In some cases, this
process requires morphological analysis and,
in other, a limited type of syntactical
analysis. Both type of analysis serve, to a
certain extend, a single purpose: that of
expressing compactly what would otherwise
be a big list of tokens (in some cases,
involving numerical expressions, an infinite
one). This identification step is done through
appropriate transducers. Basically, there are
two things to keep in mind when dealing
with transducers. One is that, like finite-
state-automaton, they behave like
recognisers; that is, when applied to an input
string, if it can parse it from start to finish,
the string is accepted and otherwise rejected.
The second is that when doing so, it will
produce an output as a result. TransCheck
relies on that last property of transducers to
produce a unique representation for tokens
that are different in form, but semantically
identical, as we will now see.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.968985">
2.4 Normalisation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999735">
Though we will normally be interested in
the identification of every morphological
form for a given &amp;quot;interesting&amp;quot; token, once
identified, these differences will be

discarded by TranCheck. Compare the
examples below.
• Air bag / air bags

• June lst , 2000 / the first of June, 2000
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.997150333333333">
The examples above are all in English, but
the same type of diversity can be found in
French too. In Figure 1 we can see an
example showing the result of both the
process of identification (underlined) and
normalisation (=&gt;).

somewhat like a partial transfer4 component
(in a word to word translation model)

Though we haven&apos;t implemented it yet, this

translation suggestions.5
The normalisation process depicted in

factors. One is the need to disambiguate the
part of speech of the identified token.

The identification and normalisation
process described in the previous two
sections are common to deceptive cognates,
technical terms and numerical expressions
altogether. However, the comparison of the
resulting normalised forms as well as the
processing they should further undergo is of
a rather case specific nature.
During the comparison process,
TransCheck will only be concerned with the
normalised forms resulting from the
previous transduction process (the two
central columns in figure 1). Each of these
two columns will be considered as a set in
the mathematical sense. As a consequence,
the English sentence in figure I and the one

TransCheck&apos;s point of view.

flag either one is eventually taken. Each of

three subsets depending on whether they
correspond to numerical expressions,

this point the comparison process will be
very simple. Given these subsets, the

3 The TransCheck Prototype
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.942737777777778">
In the previous section, we have described
what happens when a bi-text is submitted to
TransCheck. We now turn to the steps that
will lead to a request.
Currently, TransCheck&apos;s interface is
implemented in Tcl/Tk. This has allowed us
to develop a proof of concept without
preoccupying ourselves with word
processing particularities. The down side to
this is a limitation to ascii characters that
will eventually have to be overcome by
making TransCheck part of a text editor not
unlike a spell checker.
But for the time being, a TransCheck
session would look something like this: The
user selects through an interface a French
and an English text specifying with a radio-
button which of the two is the source text.6
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.849598">
6 The system was initialy developed having in mind
132
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999992684210526">
Then the name of an alignment file is
supplied (it will be created if it doesn&apos;t
already exist). These are the minimal steps
that must be taken before any analysis can
take place. If, at this point, the bi-text is
submitted for analysis, TransCheck will use
all of it&apos;s default values and, after some
window pop-up and progress report, a
window containing the target text will
appear on screen together with the source
text facing it. All the potential errors will
appear highlighted. At this point, the user
can modify the target text to correct any
found errors. When the session ends, the
modified text will be saved (together with
the appropriately modified alignment file).
We&apos;ve just seen TransCheck&apos;s default
behaviour. The user is also offered some
customisation possibilities. This includes
highlighting only those type of errors of
interest to the user and setting the alignment
parameters. The omission detection
parameters can also be modified through an
interface. Also, since as with any normative
judgement, what is and what isn&apos;t a &amp;quot;correct&amp;quot;
form will always be subject to debate,
TransCheck allows the user to silence those
alleged mistakes causing too much noise on
a given text. Finally, the human reviser is
allowed, any time during a session, to
modify TransCheck&apos;s behaviour so that
newly identified incorrect terms will be
flagged thereafter, this to ensure that none of
subsequent occurrences of these errors will
escape his attention. This list of forbidden
terms can be saved in order to constitute
client specific databases so that identified
problems will not be lost between projects.

4 Further development and discussion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999622390243903">
At present, TransCheck allows for only
limited customisation. However, we are well
aware that the repositories available for say
deceptive cognates are costly to develop and
English as the source text. Currently, this is still
reflected only in the deceptive cognate database.
tend to include only those mistakes having a
certain &amp;quot;history&amp;quot; (stability over time). That
suggests the user should be allowed to add
new pairs of prohibited translations on the
fly. In most cases, however, adding new
behaviour is a complex process available
only to the system&apos;s designer because of
morphology and part-of-speech
considerations. Added flexibility in this
regard seems mandatory. Since we cannot
expect the human reviser to concern himself
with such technical details, these would
have to be hidden from him through
adequate input interfaces. This flexibility
seems to be desired independently from the
now emerging problem of localisation.7 We
are currently addressing these issues one at a
time.
So far, we have described the types of
errors TransCheck is concerned with, the
way they are handled and how some aspects
of the processing can be customised. No
figures as to precision and recall have been
given though. This is in part due to the
difficulty of finding preliminary translations
and in part to TransCheck&apos;s customisability.
For example, performance on omission
detection will ultimately depend on the
user&apos;s selected values. It seems to us that the
best way to address both of these problems
should be to actually put the system in the
hands of human revisers and monitor the
changes they would actually choose to
make. Efforts in that direction are currently
being made.

to meet the quality requirements and tight
deadlines they are frequently facing. We
have also stressed TransCheck&apos;s adaptability
to be somewhat limited. The problem seems
more one of ergonomics than of principle,
though. Interfaces would have to be devised
to guide users through the sometime
complicated steps associated with adding
new restrictions. We are now considering
the possibility of integrating TransCheck in
an off-the-shelf text editor to cross the ascii
barrier.

It is therefore part of the normal translation process to have a reviser look at a translator&apos;s output. His job will be to spot any typos (taken in a very broad sense to include missing chapters!). Usually, at this point the translator probably has submitted the preliminary version to a spell checker, so what could be done automatically at that level has already been done. No automatic detection of typical translation mistakes has been attempted though. That&apos;s the gap TransCheck is designed to fill. The concept of a &amp;quot;translation checker&amp;quot; was initially proposed in Isabelle and al. [8] and eventually led to a demonstration prototype concerned with the detection of a very restricted type of mistake: deceptive cognates. In comparison, the system described in this paper goes much further toward a &amp;quot;real &amp;quot; usable translation checker by allowing for the detection of errors of omission, the comparison of diverse numerical expressions and the flagging of inconsistent terminology. On the interface side, it allows for the automatic alignment of the source and target texts, the flagging of potential mistakes and the possibility of saving any modifications made to the target text. 1 Er</context>

Yet a diversity of situations can lead to such errors among which translator&apos;s fatigue and the accidental pressing of a key in a text editor, as was pointed out by Melamed [12]. Unfortunately, detecting an omission is far from being simple when taken in all its generality (from omission of single words to whole chapters). This is due in part to the fact that one language may express some ideas with a greater economy of means than another, so length difference alone isn&apos;t sufficient to identify omitted text.

Not only that, but unlike grammatical errors, we cannot anticipate something like a &amp;quot;typical&amp;quot; omission as they will appear randomly and span over any possible length of text. We must therefore recast what appears as a semantic problem in terms of more readily accessible data. The basic idea here is to assimilate an omission to a particular type of alignment where an important contiguous set of words present in the source text cannot be aligned at the word level with the target text. For this we rely on mechanisms similar to those described in Russell [15]. We can distinguish between small (a couple of sentences) and big omissions (any thing bigger than a few paragraphs). One might expect the detection of whole missing pages and chapters not to be difficult, but that&apos;s not necessarily true, as the burden of the problem then falls on the aligning program instead of the checker per se. Robustness here is the key-word since an alignment program that couldn&apos;t fall back on its feet after seeing big chunks of missing text would cause TransCheck to output only noise thereafter. The alignment program we use is one such robust program which, as a first </context>
