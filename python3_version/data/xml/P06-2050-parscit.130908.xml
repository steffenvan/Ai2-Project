This paper describes an on-going project
concerning with an ontological lexical re-
source based on the abundant conceptual
information grounded on Chinese charac-
ters. The ultimate goal of this project is set
to construct a cognitively sound and com-
putationally effective character-grounded
machine-understandable resource.
Philosophically, Chinese ideogram has its
ontological status, but its applicability to
the NLP task has not been expressed ex-
plicitly in terms of language resource. We
thus propose the first attempt to locate Chi-
nese characters within the context of on-
tology. Having the primary success in ap-
plying it to some NLP tasks, we believe
that the construction of this knowledge re-

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999745944444445">
In the history of western linguistics, writing has
long been viewed as a surrogate or substitute for
speech, the latter being the primary vehicle for hu-
man communication. Such “surrogational model”
which neglects the systematicity of writing in
its own right has also occupied the predominant
views in current computational linguistic studies.
This paper is set to provide a quite different per-
spective along with the Eastern philological tra-
dition of the study of scripts, especially the ideo-
graphic one i.e., Chinese characters (Hanzi). We
believe that the conceptual knowledge information
which has been grounded on Chinese characters
can be used as a cognitively sound and compu-
tationally effective ontological lexical resource in
performing some NLP tasks, and it will have con-
tribution to the development of Semantic Web as
well.

2 Background Issues of Chinese
Ideographic Writing

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.9229835">
2.1 Ideographic Script and Conceptual
Knowledge
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.987024823529412">
From the view of writing system and cognition,
human conceptual information has been regarded
as being wired in ideographic scripts. However, in
reviewing the contemporary linguistic literatures
concerning with the discussions of the essence of
Chinese writing system, we found that the main
theoretical dispute lies in the fact that, both struc-
tural descriptions and psycholinguistic modeling
seem to presume that the notions of ideography
and phonography are mutually exclusive.
To break the theoretical impass´e, we take a
pragmatic position in claiming the tripartite prop-
erties of Chinese characters: They are logographic
(morpho-syllabic) in essence, function phonologi-
cally at the same time, and can be interpreted ideo-
graphically and implemented as concept instances
by computers.

2.2 Chinese Wordhood
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999865875">
Roughly put, a Chinese character is regarded as
an ideographic symbol representing syllable and
meaning of a “morpheme” in spoken Chinese.
But unlike most affixing languages, Chinese has
a large class of morphemes - which Packard (2000)
calls “bound roots” - that possess certain affixal
properties (namely, they are bound and productive
in forming words), but encode lexical rather than

grammatical information. These may occur as ei-
ther the left- or right-hand component of a word.
For example, the morpheme 4 (/shu/; “transport”)
can be used as either the first morpheme (e.g., 4 .&amp;quot;,
(/y`un-r`u/; transport-into “import”), or the second
morpheme (e.g., 14 /y`un-shu/; transit-transport
“conveyance”) of a dissyllabic word, but cannot
occur in isolation.
The fuzzy boundary between free and bound
morphemes is directly related to the notori-
ous controversial notion of Chinese Wordhood.
There are multiple studies showing that to a
large extent, (trained or untrained) native speak-
ers of Chinese disagree on what a (free) mor-
pheme/word/compound is.
Such difficulty could be traced back to its histor-
ical facts. In modern Mandarin Chinese, there is a
strong tendency toward dissyllabic words, while
the predominant monosyllabic words in ancient
Chinese remain more or less a closed set. But
the conceptual knowledge encoded in monosyl-
labic morphemes still have their influence even on
contemporary texts, and thus resulting the difficul-
ties of word-marking decision.

3 Theoretical Setting
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999682608695652">
Yu et al (1999) reported that a Morpheme Knowl-
edge Base ofModern Chinese according to all Chi-
nese characters in GB2312-80 code has been con-
structed by the institute of Computational Linguis-
tics of Peking University. This Morpheme Knowl-
edge Base has been later integrated into the project
called “Grammatical Knowledge Base of Contem-
porary Chinese”.
It is noted that the “morphemes” adopted in this
database are monosyllabic “bound morphemes”.
As for “free morphemes”, that is, characters which
can be independently used as words, are not in-
cluded in the Knowledge Base. For example,
the monosyllabic character ;K (/shu/,“comb”) has
(at least) two senses. For the verbal sense (“to
comb”), it can be used as a word; for the nomi-
nal sense (“a comb”), it can only be used in com-
bining with other morphemes. Therefore, only the
nominal sense of #i. is included in the Knowledge
Base. However, such morpheme-based approach
can hardly escape from facing with the difficult
decision of free/bound distinction in contemporary
Chinese.

3.1 Hanzi/Word Space Model
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999948115384615">
Based on the consideration mentioned above, in
this paper, we will propose a historical, conven-
tionalized, pre-theoretical perspective in viewing
the lexical and knowledge information within Chi-
nese characters. In Figure 1, (a) illustrates a naive
Hanzi space, while (d) shows a linguistic theory-
laden result of Hanzi/Word space, where green ar-
eas denote to words, consisting of 1 to 4 char-
acters. The decision of words (green) and non-
words (white) in the space is based on certain per-
spectives (be it psycholinguistic or computational
linguistic). Instead, we take the traditional philo-
logical construct of Hanzi into consideration. By
analyzing the conceptual relations between char-
acters (b) which scatter among diverse lexical re-
sources, we construct an top-level ontology with
Hanzi as its instances (c). Rather than (a) — (d),
which is a predominant approach in contempo-
rary linguistic theoretical construction of Chinese
Wordhood, we believe that the proposed approach
(a) — (b) — (c) — (d) could not only enclose
the implicit conceptual information evolutionarily
encoded in Chinese characters, but also provide a
more clear knowledge scenario for the interaction
of characters/words in modern linguistic theoreti-
cal setting.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999276">
3.2 Conset and Character Ontology
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999876">
The new model that we propose here is called
HanziNet. It relies on a novel notion called con-
set and a coarsely grained upper-level ontology
of characters.
In comparison with synset, which has become
a core notion in the construction of Wordnet-like
lexical semantic resources, we will argue that there
is a crucial difference between Word-based lexi-
cal resource and character-based lexical resource,
in that they rest with finely-differentiated informa-
tion contents represented by the nodes of network.
A synset, or synonym set in WordNet contains a
group of words,1 and each of which is synony-
mous with the other words in the same synset.
In WordNet’s design, each synset can be viewed
as a concept in a taxonomy, While in HanziNet,
we are seeking to align Hanzi which share a given
putatively primitive meaning extracted from tradi-
tional philological resources, so a new term con-
set (concept set) is proposed. A conset contains

which can be words or collocations.

a group of Chinese characters similar in concept,
and each of which shares with similar conceptual
information with the other characters in the same
conset.2
The relations between consets constitute a char-
acter ontology. Formally, it is a tree-structured
conceptual taxonomy in terms of which only two
kinds of relations are allowed: the INSTANCE-OF
(i.e., characters are instances of consets) and IS-
A relations (i.e., consets are hypernyms/hyponyms
to other consets).
Currently, frequently used monosyllabic char-
acters are assigned to at least one of 309 consets.
Following are some examples:

*_..4.0-..x.,
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999978857142857">
In fact, the core assumption behind the
synset/conset distinction is non-trivial. In this
project, we assume a hypothesis of the locality
of Concept Gestalt and the context-sensibility of
Word Sense concerning with Chinese characters.
That is, characters carry two meaning dimensions:
on the one hand, they are lexicalized concepts;
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.656191">
2At the time of writing, about 3,600 characters have been
finished in their information construction.
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998609">
on the other hands, they can be observed lin-
guistically as bound root morphemes and mono-
morphemic words according to their independent
usage in modern Chinese texts.
Figure 2 shows a schematic diagram of our pro-
posed model. In Aitchison’s (2003) terms, for the
character level, we take an “atomic globule” net-
work viewpoint, where the characters - realized as
instances of core concept Gestalt - which share
similar conceptual information, cluster together.
The relationships between these concept Gestalt
form a rooted tree structure. Characters are thus
assigned to the leaves of the tree in terms of an
assemblage of bits. For the word level, we take
the “cobweb” viewpoint, as words -built up from
a pool of characters- are connected to each other
through lexical semantic relations. In such case,
the network does not form a tree structure but a
more complex, long-range highly-correlated ran-
dom acyclic graphic structure.

The current lexicon contains over 5000 characters,

part of the MRD lexicon in HanziNet. Con-
cepts in HanziNet are indicated by means
of a label (conset name) with a code form.
In order to increase the efficiency, an ideal
strategy is to adopt the Huffmann-coding-like
method, by encoding the conceptual structure
of Hanzi as a pattern of bits set within a bit
string.4 The coding thus refers to the assign-
ment of code sequences to an character. The
sequence of edges from the root to any char-
acter yields the code for that character, and
the number of bits varies from one character
to another. Currently, for each conset (309 in
total) there are 12 characters assigned on the
average; for each character, it is assigned to

The second core component of the proposed re-

previously, HanziNet takes a different perspective in locating

Base Concepts (Vossen 1998).
As mentioned, a tentative set of 309 conset,
a kind of ontological categories in contrast with
synset has been proposed 7, and over 5000 charac-
ters have been used as instances in populating the
character ontology.
Methodologically, following the basic line of
OntoClear approach (Guarino and Welty (2002)),
we use simple monotonic inheritance in our ontol-
ogy design, which means that each node inherits
properties only from a single ancestor, and the in-
herited value cannot be overwritten at any point of
the ontology. The decision to keep the relations
to one single parent was made in order to guaran-
tee that the structure would be able to grow indef-
initely and still be manageable, i.e. that the tran-
sitive quality of the relations between the nodes
would not degenerate with size. Figure 4 shows a
snapshot of the character ontology.

6 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999948580645161">
In conclusion, the goal of this research is set
to survey the unique characteristics of Chinese
Ideographs.
Though it has been well understood and agreed
upon in cognitive linguistics that concepts can be
represented in many ways, using various construc-
tions at different syntactical levels, conceptual rep-
resentation at the script level has been unfortu-
nately both undervalued and under-represented in
computational linguistics. Therefore, the Hanzi-
driven conceptual approach in this thesis might re-
quire that we consider the Chinese writing system
from a perspective that is not normally found in
canonical treatments of writing systems in con-
temporary linguistics.
Against the deep-seated tradition in contempo-
rary Chinese linguistics, which views the use of
Chinese characters in scientific theories as a mani-
festation of mathematical immaturity and interpre-
tational subjectivity, we propose the first lexical
knowledge resource based on Chinese characters
in the field of linguistic as well as in the NLP.
It is noted that HanziNet, as a general knowl-
edge resource, should not claim to be a sufficient
knowledge resource in and of itself, but instead
seek to provide a groundwork for the incremen-
tal integration of other knowledge resources for
language processing tasks. In order to augment
HanziNet, additional information will needed to
be incorporated and mapped into HanziNet. This
leads us to several avenues of future research.

In the case of Chinese, three existing lexical resources (AM Radicals::Hantology (Chou and Huang (2005))- -T Characters::HanziNet - � Words::Chinese Wordnet) constitutes an integrated 3-level knowledge scenario which would provide important insights into the problems of understanding the complexities and its interaction with Chinese natural language. 6 Conclusion In conclusion, the goal of this research is set to survey the unique characteristics of Chinese Ideographs. Though it has been well understood and agreed upon in cognitive linguistics that concepts can be represented in many ways, using various constructions at different syntactical levels, conceptual representation at the script level</context>

As mentioned, a tentative set of 309 conset, a kind of ontological categories in contrast with synset has been proposed 7, and over 5000 characters have been used as instances in populating the character ontology. Methodologically, following the basic line of OntoClear approach (Guarino and Welty (2002)), we use simple monotonic inheritance in our ontology design, which means that each node inherits properties only from a single ancestor, and the inherited value cannot be overwritten at any point of the ontology. The decision to keep the relations to one single parent was made in order to guarantee that the structure would be able to grow indefinitely and still be manageable, i.e. that the transitive quality of the relations between the nodes would not degenerate with size.

To break the theoretical impass´e, we take a pragmatic position in claiming the tripartite properties of Chinese characters: They are logographic (morpho-syllabic) in essence, function phonologically at the same time, and can be interpreted ideographically and implemented as concept instances by computers. 2.2 Chinese Wordhood Roughly put, a Chinese character is regarded as an ideographic symbol representing syllable and meaning of a “morpheme” in spoken Chinese. But unlike most affixing languages, Chinese has a large class of morphemes - which Packard (2000) calls “bound roots” - that possess certain affixal properties (namely, they are bound and productive in forming words), but encode lexical rather than 385 Proceedings of the COLING/ACL 2006 Main Conference Poster Sessions, pages 385–390, Sydney, July 2006. c�2006 Association for Computational Linguistics grammatical information. These may occur as either the left- or right-hand component of a word. For example, the morpheme 4 (/shu/; “transport”) can be used as either the first morpheme (e.g., 4 .&amp;quot;, (/y`un-r`u/; transport-into “import”), or the second morpheme (e.g., 14 /y`un-shu/; transit-tr</context>

Such difficulty could be traced back to its historical facts. In modern Mandarin Chinese, there is a strong tendency toward dissyllabic words, while the predominant monosyllabic words in ancient Chinese remain more or less a closed set. But the conceptual knowledge encoded in monosyllabic morphemes still have their influence even on contemporary texts, and thus resulting the difficulties of word-marking decision. 3 Theoretical Setting Yu et al (1999) reported that a Morpheme Knowledge Base ofModern Chinese according to all Chinese characters in GB2312-80 code has been constructed by the institute of Computational Linguistics of Peking University. This Morpheme Knowledge Base has been later integrated into the project called “Grammatical Knowledge Base of Contemporary Chinese”. It is noted that the “morphemes” adopted in this database are monosyllabic “bound morphemes”. As for “free morphemes”, that is, characters which can be independently used as words, are not included in the Knowledge Base. For example, the monosyllabic character ;K (/</context>
