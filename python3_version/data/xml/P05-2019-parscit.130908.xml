We report on an investigation of the prag-
matic category of topic in Danish dia-
log and its correlation to surface features
of NPs. Using a corpus of 444 utter-
ances, we trained a decision tree system
on 16 features. The system achieved near-
human performance with success rates of
84–89% and F1-scores of 0.63–0.72 in 10-
fold cross validation tests (human perfor-
mance: 89% and 0.78). The most im-
portant features turned out to be prever-
bal position, definiteness, pronominalisa-
tion, and non-subordination. We discov-
ered that NPs in epistemic matrix clauses
(e.g. “I think... ”) were seldom topics and
we suspect that this holds for other inter-
personal matrix clauses as well.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.987060961538461">
The pragmatic category of topic is notoriously dif-
ficult to pin down, and it has been defined in many
ways (B¨uring, 1999; Davison, 1984; Engdahl and
Vallduvi, 1996; Gundel, 1988; Lambrecht, 1994;
Reinhart, 1982; Vallduvi, 1992). The common de-
nominator is the notion of topic as what an utter-
ance is about. We take this as our point of depar-
ture in this corpus-based investigation of the corre-
lations between linguistic surface features and prag-
matic topicality in Danish dialog.
*We thank Daniel Hardt and two anonymous reviewers for
many helpful comments on drafts of this paper.
Danish is a verb-second language. Its word order
is fixed, but only to a certain degree, in that it al-
lows any main clause constituent to occur in the pre-
verbal position. The first position thus has a privi-
leged status in Danish, often associated with topical-
ity (Harder and Poulsen, 2000; Togeby, 2003). We
were thus interested in investigating how well the
topic correlates with the preverbal position, along
with other features, if any.
Our findings could prove useful for the further in-
vestigation of local dialog coherence in Danish. In
particular, it may be worthwile in future work to
study the relation of our notion of topic to the Cb
of Grosz et al.s (1995) Centering Theory.

The basis of our investigation was two dialogs from
a corpus of doctor-patient conversations (Hermann,
1997). Each of the selected dialogs was between a
woman in her thirties and her doctor. The doctor was
the same in the two conversations, and the overall
topic of both was the weight problems of the patient.
One of the dialogs consisted of 125 utterances (165
NPs), the other 319 (449 NPs).

3.1 Identification of topic expressions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999777357142857">
Topics are distinguished from topic expressions fol-
lowing Lambrecht (1994). Topics are entities prag-
matically construed as being what an utterance is
about. A topic expression, on the other hand, is an
NP that formally expresses the topic in the utterance.
Topic expressions were identified through a two-step
procedure; 1) identifying topics and 2) determining
the topic expressions on the basis of the topics.
First, the topic was identified strictly based on
pragmatic aboutness using a modified version of the
‘about test’ (Lambrecht, 1994; Reinhart, 1982).
The about test consists of embedding the utter-
ance in question in an ‘about-sentence’ as in Lam-
brecht’s example shown below as (1):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.444596">
(1) He said about the children that they went to school.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.945035761904762">
This is a paraphrase of the sentence the children
went to school which indicates that the referent of
the children is the topic because it is appropriate (in
the imagined discourse context) to embed this refer-
ent as an NP in the about matrix clause. (Again, the
referent of the children is the topic, while the NP the
children is the topic expression.)
We adapted the about test for dialog by adding a
request to ‘say something about ... ’ or ‘ask about
. . .’ before the utterance in question. Each utter-
ance was judged in context, and the best topic was
identified as illustrated below. In example (2), the
last utterance, (2-D3), was assigned the topic TIME
OF LAST WEIGHING. This happened after consider-
ing which about construction gave the most coherent
and natural sounding result combined with the utter-
ance. Example (3) shows a few about constructions
that the coder might come up with, and in this con-
text (3-iv) was chosen as the best alternative.

TIENT.
iii. Say something about THE LAST WEIGHING OF THE
PATIENT.
iv. Say something about THE TIME OF LAST WEIGHING
OF THE PATIENT.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9976428">
Creating the about constructions involved a great
deal of creativity and made them difficult to com-
pare. Sometimes the coders chose the exact same
topic, at other times they were obviously differ-
ent, but frequently it was difficult to decide. For
instance, for one utterance Coder 1 chose OTHER
CAUSES OF EDEMA SYMPTOM, while Coder 2
chose THE EDEMA’S CONNECTION TO OTHER
THINGS. Slightly different wordings like these made
it impossible to test the intersubjectivity of the topic
coding.
The second step consisted in actually identifying
the topic expression. This was done by selecting the
NP in the utterance that was the best formal repre-
sentation of the topic, using 3 criteria:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.941453833333333">
1. The topic expression is the NP in the utterance that refers
to the topic.
2. If no such NP exists, then the topic expression is the NP
whose referent the topic is a property or aspect of.
3. If no NP fulfills one of these criteria, then the utterance
has no topic expression.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.983865368421053">
In the example from before, (2-D3), it was judged
that det ‘it’ (emphasized) was the topic expression
of the utterance, because it shared reference with the
chosen topic from (3-iv).
If two NPs in an utterance had the same reference,
the best topic representative was chosen. In reflexive
constructions like (4), the non-reflexive NP, in this
case jeg ‘I’, is considered the best representative.
mig
me (i.e. lost weight)
In syntactially complex utterances, the best repre-
sentative of the topic was considered the one occur-
ring in the clause most closely related to the topic. In
the following example, since the topic was THE PA-
TIENT’S HANDLING OF EATING, the topic expres-
sion had to be one of the two instances of jeg ‘I’.
Since the topic arguably concerns ‘handling’ more
than ‘eating’, the NP in the matrix clause (empha-
sized) is the topic expression.

A final example of several NPs referring to the
same topic has to do with left-dislocation. In ex-
ample (6), the preverbal object ham ‘him’ is imme-
diately preceded by its antecedent min far ‘my fa-
ther’. Both NPs express the topic of the utterance. In
Danish, resumptive pronouns in left-dislocation con-
structions always occur in preverbal position, and in
cases where they express the topic there will thus
always be two NPs directly adjacent to each other
which both refer to the topic. In such cases, we con-
sider the resumptive pronoun the topic expression,
partly because it may be considered a more inte-
grated part of the sentence (cf. Lambrecht (1994)).

The intersubjectivity of the topic expression an-
notation was tested in two ways. First, all the topic
expression annotations of the two coders were com-
pared. This showed that topic expressions can be an-
notated reasonably reliably (r. = 0.70 (see table 1)).
Second, to make sure that this intersubjectivity was
not just a product of mutual influence between the
two authors, a third, independent coder annotated a
small, random sample of the data for topic expres-
sions (50 NPs). Comparing this to the annotation of
the two main coders confirmed reasonable reliability
(r. = 0.70).
main stress distinction only applies to pronouns in
Danish.) These can also be annotated reliably (pro:
C1 = 289, C2 = 289, C1+2 = 289, repro = 1.00; def: C1 = 319, C2 = 318, C1+2 =
318, redef = 0.99; str: C1 = 226, C2 = 226, C1+2 = 203, restr = 0.80).
Unmarked surface position. NPs were anno-
tated for occurrence in pre-verbal (pre) or post-
verbal (post) position relative to their subcategoriz-
ing verb. Thus, in the following example, det ‘it’ is
+pre, but –post, because det is not subcategorized
by tror ‘think’.

position were annotated for whether they were rep-
etitions of a left-dislocated element (ldis). Example

After annotating the topics and topic expressions, 16
grammatical, morphological, and prosodic features
were annotated. First the smaller corpus was anno-
tated by the two main coders in collaboration in or-
der to establish annotating policies in unclear cases.
Then the features were annotated individually by the
two coders in the larger corpus.
Grammatical roles. Each NP was categorized as
grammatical subject (sbj), object (obj), or oblique
(obl).These features can be annotated reliably (sbj: C1
(number of sbj’s identified by Coder 1) = 208, C2 (sbj’s identified by Coder 2) =
207, C1+2 (Coder 1 and 2 overlap) = 207, resbj = 1.00; obj: C1 = 110, C2 = 109,
C1+2 = 106, reobj = 0.97; obl: C1 = 30, C2 = 50, C1+2 = 29, reobl = 0.83).
Morphological and phonological features. NPs
were annotated for pronominalisation (pro), defi-
niteness (def), and main stress (str). (Note that the

+cle, leaves an ‘empty slot’, e, in the relative clause,

Sentence type and subordination. Each NP was
annotated with respect to whether or not it appeared
in an interrogative sentence (int) or a subordinate
clause (sub), and finally, all NPs were coded as to
whether they occurred in an epistemic matrix clause
or in a clause subordinated to an epistemic matrix
clause (epi). An epistemic matrix clause is defined
as a matrix clause whose function it is to evaluate
the truth of its subordinate clause (such as “I think
... ”). The following example illustrates how we an-
notated both NPs in the epistemic matrix clause and
NPs in its immediate subordinate clause as +epi, but
not NPs in further subordinated clauses. The +epi
feature requires a +/–sub feature in order to deter-
mine whether the NP in question is in the epistemic
matrix clause or subordinated under it. Subordina-
tion is shown here using parentheses.

2 Only one constituent is allowed in the intrasentential pre-
verbal position. Left-dislocated elements are not considered
part of the sentence proper, and thus do not count as preverbal
elements, cf. Lambrecht (1994).
In the third stage of our investigation, a decision tree
(DT) generator was used to extract correlations be-
tween topic expressions and surface features. Three
different data sets were used to train and test the
DTs, all based on the larger dialog.
Two of these data sets were derived from the com-
plete set of NPs annotated by each main coder in-
dividually. These two data sets will be referred to
below as the ‘Coder 1’ and ‘Coder 2’ data sets.
The third data set was obtained by including only
NPs annotated identically by both main coders in
relevant features3. This data set represents a higher
degree of intersubjectivity, especially in the topic ex-
pression category, but at the cost of a smaller number
of NPs. 63 out of a total of 449 NPs had to be ex-
cluded because of inter-coder disagreement, 50 due
to disagreement on the topic expression category.
This data set will be referred to below as the ‘In-
tersection’ data set.
A DT was generated for each of these three data
sets, and each DT was tested using 10-fold cross val-
idation, yielding the success rates reported below.

The DT for the Coder 1 data set contains the fea-
tures def, pro, dsi, sub, and pre. According to this
classification, a definite pronoun in the fronted po-
sition of a Danish sentence intertwining construc-
tion is a topic expression, and other than that, def-
inite pronouns in the preverbal position of non-
subordinate clauses are topic expressions. The 10-
fold cross validation test yields an 84% success rate.
F1-score: 0.63.
The Coder 2 DT contains the features pro, def,
sub, pre, int, and epi. Here, if a definite pronoun
occurs in a subordinate clause it is not a topic ex-
pression, and otherwise it is a topic expression if it
occurs in the preverbal position. If it does not oc-
cur in preverbal position, but in a question, it is also
a topic expression unless it occurs in an epistemic
matrix clause. Success rate: 85%. F1-score: 0.67.
Finally, the Intersection DT contains the features
pro, def, sub, and pre. According to this DT,
only definite pronouns in preverbal position in non-
subordinate clauses are topic expressions. The DT
has a high success rate of 89% in the cross vali-
dation test — which is not surprising, given that a
large number of possibly difficult cases have been
removed (mainly the 50 NPs where the two coders
disagreed on the annotation of topic expressions).
F1-score: 0.72.
Since there is no gold standard for annotating
topic expressions, the best evaluation of the human
performance is in terms of the amount of agreement
between the two coders. Success rate and F1 analogs
for human performance were therefore computed as
follows, using the figures displayed in table 1.

The reason seems to be that these NPs occur in
epistemic matrix clauses (+epi).
The following utterances have not been annotated
for the +epi feature, since the matrix clauses do not
seem to state the speaker’s attitude towards the truth
of the subordinate clause. However, the emphasized
NPs seem to stand in a very similar relation to the
message being conveyed, and none of them were
perceived as topic expressions.

clause than the epistemic matrix clause, namely the
interpersonal matrix clause (Jensen, 2003) would be
relevant in this context. This category would cover
all of the above cases. It is defined as a matrix
clause that expresses some attitude towards the mes-

We have shown that it is possible to generate al-
gorithms for Danish dialog that are able to predict
the topic expressions of utterances with near-human
performance (success rates of 84–89%, F1 scores of
0.63–0.72).
Furthermore, our investigation has shown that
the most characteristic features of topic expres-
sions are preverbal position (+pre), definiteness
(+def), pronominal realisation (+pro), and non-
subordination (–sub). This supports the traditional
view of topic as the constituent in preverbal position.
Most interesting is subordination in connection
with certain matrix clauses. We discovered that NPs
in epistemic matrix clauses were seldom topics. In
complex constructions like these the topic expres-
sion occurs in the subordinate clause, not the ma-
trix clause as would be expected. We suspect that
this can be extended to the more general category of
inter-personal matrix clauses.
Future work on dialog coherence in Danish, par-
ticularly pronoun resolution, may benefit from our
results. The centering model, originally formulated
by Grosz et al. (1995), models discourse coherence
in terms of a ‘local center of attention’, viz. the
backward-looking center, Cb. Insofar as the Cb cor-
responds to a notion like topic, the corpus-based in-
vestigation reported here might serve as the empiri-
cal basis for an adaptation for Danish dialog of the
centering model. Attempts have already been made
to adapt centering to dialog (Byron and Stent, 1998),
and, importantly, work has also been done on adapt-
ing the centering model to other, freer word order
languages such as German (Strube and Hahn, 1999).

Topics are entities pragmatically construed as being what an utterance is about. A topic expression, on the other hand, is an NP that formally expresses the topic in the utterance. Topic expressions were identified through a two-step procedure; 1) identifying topics and 2) determining the topic expressions on the basis of the topics. First, the topic was identified strictly based on pragmatic aboutness using a modified version of the ‘about test’ (Lambrecht, 1994; Reinhart, 1982).

In example (6), the preverbal object ham ‘him’ is immediately preceded by its antecedent min far ‘my father’. Both NPs express the topic of the utterance. In Danish, resumptive pronouns in left-dislocation constructions always occur in preverbal position, and in cases where they express the topic there will thus always be two NPs directly adjacent to each other which both refer to the topic. In such cases, we consider the resumptive pronoun the topic expression, partly because it may be considered a more integrated part of the sentence (cf. Lambrecht (1994)). (6) min my The intersubjectivity of the topic expression annotation was tested in two ways. First, all the topic expression annotations of the two coders were compared. This showed that topic expressions can be annotated reasonably reliably (r. = 0.70 (see table 1)). Second, to make sure that this intersubjectivity was not just a product of mutual influence between the two authors, a third, independent coder annotated a small, random sample of the data for topic expressions (50 NPs).

Left-dislocated elements are not considered part of the sentence proper, and thus do not count as preverbal elements, cf. Lambrecht (1994). In the third stage of our investigation, a decision tree (DT) generator was used to extract correlations between topic expressions and surface features. Three different data sets were used to train and test the DTs, all based on the larger dialog. Two of these data sets were derived from the complete set of NPs annotated by each main coder individually. These two data sets will be referred to below as the ‘Coder 1’ and ‘Coder 2’ data sets.

Danish is a verb-second language. Its word order is fixed, but only to a certain degree, in that it allows any main clause constituent to occur in the preverbal position. The first position thus has a privileged status in Danish, often associated with topicality (Harder and Poulsen, 2000; Togeby, 2003). We were thus interested in investigating how well the topic correlates with the preverbal position, along with other features, if any. Our findings could prove useful for the further investigation of local dialog coherence in Danish. In particular, it may be worthwile in future work to study the relation of our notion of topic to the Cb of Grosz et al.s (1995) Centering Theory. 2 The corpus The basis of our investigation was two dialogs from a corpus of doctor-patient conversations (Hermann, 1997). Each of the selected dialogs was between a woman in her thirties and her doctor. The doctor wa</context>

The most important features turned out to be preverbal position, definiteness, pronominalisation, and non-subordination. We discovered that NPs in epistemic matrix clauses (e.g. “I think... ”) were seldom topics and we suspect that this holds for other interpersonal matrix clauses as well. 1 Introduction The pragmatic category of topic is notoriously difficult to pin down, and it has been defined in many ways (B¨uring, 1999; Davison, 1984; Engdahl and Vallduvi, 1996; Gundel, 1988; Lambrecht, 1994; Reinhart, 1982; Vallduvi, 1992). The common denominator is the notion of topic as what an utterance is about. We take this as our point of departure in this corpus-based investigation of the correlations between linguistic surface features and pragmatic topicality in Danish dialog. *We thank Daniel Hardt and two anonymous reviewers for many helpful comments on drafts of this paper.
