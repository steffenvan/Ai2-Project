<bodyText confidence="0.9998795">
As interest grows in the use of linguistically
annotated corpora in research and teaching of
foreign languages and literature, treebanks of
various historical texts have been developed.
We introduce the first large-scale dependency
treebank for Classical Chinese literature. De-
rived from the Stanford dependency types, it
consists of over 32K characters drawn from a
collection of poems written in the 8th century
CE. We report on the design of new depend-
ency relations, discuss aspects of the annota-
tion process and evaluation, and illustrate its
use in a study of parallelism in Classical Chi-
nese poetry.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99984255882353">
Recent efforts in creating linguistically annotated
text corpora have overwhelmingly focused on
modern languages. Among the earliest and most
well-known are the part-of-speech (POS) tagged
Brown Corpus (Francis &amp; Kučera, 1982), and the
syntactically analyzed Penn Treebank (Marcus et
al., 1993). However, the first digital corpus, which
emerged soon after the invention of computers, had
as its subject matter a collection of 13th-century
texts --- in 1949, Roberto Busa initiated the POS
tagging of the complete works of Thomas Aquinas,
written in Latin.
In the past decade, Humanities scholars have
begun to use digital corpora for the study of an-
cient languages and historical texts. They come in
a variety of languages and genres, from Old Eng-
lish (Taylor et al., 2003) to Early New High Ger-
man (Demske et al., 2004) and Medieval Portu-
guese (Rocio et al. 2000); and from poetry
(Pintzuk &amp; Leendert, 2001) to religious texts such
as the New Testament (Haug &amp; Jøhndal, 2008) and
the Quran (Dukes &amp; Buckwalter, 2010). They are
increasingly being leveraged in teaching (Crane et
al., 2009) and in research (Lancaster, 2010).
This paper describes the first large-scale de-
pendency treebank for Classical Chinese. The
treebank consists of poems from the Tang Dynasty
(618 – 907 CE), considered one of the crowning
achievements in traditional Chinese literature. The
first half of the paper reviews related work (section
2), then describes the design of the treebank (sec-
tion 3), its text and evaluation (section 4). The
second half shows the research potentials of this
treebank with a study on parallelism in (section 5).

Existing linguistic resources for Chinese is pre-
dominantly for the modern language. This section
first describes the major Modern Chinese treebanks
on which we based our work (section 2.1), then
summarizes previous research in word segmenta-
tion and POS tagging, two pre-requisites for build-
ing a Classical Chinese treebank (section 2.2).

(Hajic, 1998). The most widely used treebank for
Modern Chinese, the Penn Chinese Treebank (Xue
et al., 2005), belongs to the former kind.
Rather than encoding constituency information,
dependency grammars give information about
grammatical relations between words. Modern
Chinese has been analyzed in this framework, for
example at Stanford University (Chang et al.,
2009). The dependency relations follow the design
principles of those initially applied to English (de
Marneffe and Manning, 2008), with a few added
relations to accommodate Chinese-specific fea-
tures, such as the “ba”-construction. Their POS
tagset is borrowed from that of the Penn Chinese
Treebank.

<bodyText confidence="0.998299814814815">
Like its modern counterpart, two pre-requisites for
constructing a Classical Chinese treebank are word
segmentation and part-of-speech tagging. In this
section, we first summarize existing POS tagging
frameworks, then describe the only current tree-
bank of Classical Chinese.
Word boundaries and parts-of-speech tags have
been added to the Academia Sinica Ancient Chi-
nese Corpus (Wei et al., 1997) and the Sheffield
Corpus of Chinese (Hu et al., 2005). Since there is
not yet a scholarly consensus on word segmenta-
tion in Chinese (Feng 1998), it is not surprising
that there are wide-ranging levels of granularity of
the POS tagsets. They range from 21 tags in
(Huang et al., 2002), 26 in the Peking University
corpus (Yu et al., 2002), 46 in the Academia Sini-
ca Balanced Corpus (Chen et al., 1996), to 111 in
the Sheffield Corpus of Chinese (Hu et al., 2005).
This treebank uses a system of nested POS tags
(Lee, 2012), which accommodates different poli-
cies for word segmentation and maximize interop-
erability between corpora.
The only previous syntactic treebank for Classi-
cal Chinese is a constituent-based one (Huang et
al., 2002), composed of 1000 sentences from pre-
Tsin Classical Chinese. No word segmentation was
performed for this treebank.

Although Classical Chinese is not mutually intelli-
gible with Modern Chinese, the two share consid-
erable similarities in vocabulary and grammar.
Given the seminal work already achieved for Mod-
ern Chinese, our principle is to borrow from exist-
ing annotation framework as much as possible. For
example, our POS tagset is based on that of the
Penn Chinese Treebank, after a slight revision of
its 33 tags (Lee, 2012). This approach not only
gives users a familiar point of reference, and also
makes the treebank interoperable with existing
Modern Chinese resources. Interoperability allows
the potential of bootstrapping with Modern Chi-
nese data, as well as contrastive studies for the two
languages.

A dependency framework is chosen for two rea-
sons. First, words in Classical Chinese poems, our
target text (section 4), tend to have relatively free
word order. Dependency grammars can handle
this phenomenon well. Second, our treebank is
expected to be used pedagogically, and we expect
explicit grammatical relations between words to be
helpful to students. These relations also encode

semantic information, which lend themselves to
meaning extraction applications.
Our set of dependency relations is based on
those developed at Stanford University for Modern
Chinese (see section 2.2). Our approach is to map
their 44 dependency relations, as much as possible,
to Classical Chinese. Modern Chinese, a non-
inflectional language, does not mark many linguis-
tic features, including person, gender, and number,
etc. It uses a small number of function words to
encode other features, such as tense, voice, and
case. Many of these function words do not exist in
Classical Chinese. In particular, prepositions are
rare2; instead, nouns expressing time, locations,
instruments, indirect recipients, etc., modify the
verb directly. This phenomenon prompted the in-
troduction of two new relations “locative modifi-
ers” (section 3.1) and “oblique objects” (section
3.2); and the re-instatement of two relations, “noun
phrases as adverbial modifiers” (section 3.3) and
“indirect objects”, from the Stanford dependencies
(de Marneffe and Manning, 2008) that are exclud-
ed from the Modern Chinese variant (Chang et al.,
2009) . An overview is provided in Table 1.

To indicate time, English usually requires a prepo-
sition (e.g., ‘on Monday’), but sometimes does not

(e.g., ‘today’). For the latter case, the bare noun
phrase is considered a “temporal modifier” in a
tmod relation with the verb in (de Marneffe and
Manning, 2008).
Similarly, to indicate locations, a preposition is
normally required in English (e.g., ‘on the hill’).
However, in Classical Chinese, the preposition is
frequently omitted, with the bare locative noun
phrase modifying the verb directly. To mark these
nouns, we created the “locative modifier” relation
(lmod). Consider sentence (1) in Table 2. Alt-
hough the word “hill” occupies the position nor-
mally reserved for the subject, it actually indicates
a location, and is therefore assigned the lmod rela-
tion. In sentence (2), the locative noun ‘alley’ is
placed after the verb.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999004">
3.2 Oblique objects
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999989578947369">
Oblique objects are a well-known category in the
analysis of ancient Indo-European languages, for
example Latin and ancient Greek. In the PROIEL
treebank (Haug and Jøhndal, 2008), for example,
the “oblique” (obl) relation marks arguments of
the verb which are not subjects or non-accusative
‘objects’. These are most commonly nouns in the
dative or ablative case, as well as prepositional
phrases. It is believed that oblique objects exist in
Classical Chinese, but have been replaced by prep-
ositional phrases in Modern Chinese (Li and Li,
1986).
The obl relation is imported to our treebank to
mark nouns that directly modify a verb to express
means, instrument, and respect, similar to the func-
tions of datives and ablatives. They typically come
after the verb. In sentence (6) in Table 2, the noun
‘cup’ is used in an instrumental sense to modify
‘drunk’ in an obl relation.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.988706">
3.3 Noun phrase as adverbial modifier
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999689875">
A temporal modifier such as “today” is an example
where a noun phrase serves as an adverbial modifi-
er in English. This usage is more general and ex-
tends to other categories such as floating reflexives
(e.g., it is itself adequate), and other PP-like NPs
(e.g., two times a day). These noun phrases are
marked with the relation npadvmod in (de Marn-
effe and Manning, 2008).

In Modern Chinese, this usage is less frequent4,
perhaps leading to its exclusion in (Chang et al.,

function much more frequently in this capacity,
expressing metaphoric meaning, reasons, moods,

provide examples of this kind, with the noun ‘self’

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.977604">
3.4 Indirect objects
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998993055555556">
The double object construction contains two ob-
jects in a verb phrase. The direct object is the
thing or person that is being transferred or moved
(e.g., “he gave me a book”); the indirect object is
the recipient (“he gave me a book”). In inflected
languages, the noun representing the indirect ob-
ject may be marked by case. Since Classical Chi-
nese does not have this linguistic device, the
indirect object is unmarked; we distinguish it with
the “indirect object” label (iobj).
The iobj label exists in Stanford English de-
pendencies (de Marneffe and Manning, 2008), but
was not included in the Modern Chinese version
(Chang et al., 2009), likely due to its infrequent
appearance in Modern Chinese. It is re-instated in
our Classical Chinese treebank. Sentence (3) in
Table 2 provides an example, with ‘word’ as the
direct object and ‘person’ as the indirect.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998332">
3.5 Absence of copular verbs
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9992598125">
In a copular construction such as “A is B”, A is
considered the “topic” (top) of the copular verb
“is” (Chang et al., 2009). The copular, however, is
rarely used in Classical Chinese (Pulleyblank,
1995). In some cases, it is replaced by an adverb
that functions as a copular verb. If so, that adverb
is POS-tagged as such (VC) in our treebank, and
the dependency tree structure is otherwise normal.
In other cases, the copular is absent altogether.
Rather than inserting implicit nodes as in (Haug
and Jøhndal, 2008), we expand the usage of the
top relation. It usually connects the subject (“A”)
to the copular, but would in this case connect it
with the noun predicate (“B”) instead. In the ex-
ample sentence below, the relation top(‘capable’,
‘general’) would be assigned.

3.6 Discourse relations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999754916666667">
Two clauses may be connected by a discourse rela-
tion, such as causal or temporal. In English, these
relations may be explicitly realized, most common-
ly by discourse connectives, such as ‘because’ or
‘when’. Even in the absence of these connectives,
however, two adjacent clauses can still hold an
implicit discourse relation. A detailed study, which
resulted in the Penn Discourse Treebank (Prasad et
al., 2008), found that explicit relations outnumber
implicit ones in English, but the latter is nonethe-
less quite common and can be annotated with high
inter-annotator agreement.

In many ancient languages, explicit realization
of discourse relations is less frequent. In Latin and
Ancient Greek, for instance, these connectives are
often replaced by a participial clause. The partici-
ple is marked only by the genitive or ablative case,
leaving the reader to decide from context how it
relates to the main clause. As a non-inflectional
language, Classical Chinese cannot use this device,
and instead typically constructs a complex sen-
tence with a series of verbs without any marking
(Pulleyblank, 1995). For example, sentence (2) in

<bodyText confidence="0.997023782608696">
Table 3 literally says ‘not capable, good ruler for-
sake’; the onus is put on the reader to interpret the
first two characters to form a clause that provides
the reason for the rest of the line.
This condensed style of expression often erects a
barrier for understanding. Although the focus of
the treebank is on syntax rather than discourse, we
decided to annotate these relations. Implicit con-
nectives are more difficult to achieve inter-
annotator agreement (Prasad et al., 2008); since
they are mostly implicit in Classical Chinese, we
adopted a coarse-grained classification system,
rather than the hierarchical system of sense tags in
the Penn Discourse Treebank. More precisely, it
contains only the four categories posited by
(Wang, 2003) --- causal, concessive, temporal, and
conditional. Table 3 gives some examples.
When it is impossible to determine the discourse
relation between two lines, the default “dependent”
(dep) label is assigned. This label is originally
used when “the system is unable to determine a
more precise dependency relation between two
words” (de Marneffe and Manning, 2008).

Among the various literary genres, poetry enjoys
perhaps the most elevated status in the Classical
Chinese tradition. The Tang Dynasty is considered
the golden age of shi, one of the five subgenres of
Chinese poetry7. The Complete Shi Poetry of the
Tang (Peng, 1960), originally compiled in 1705,
consists of nearly 50,000 poems by more than two
thousand poets. This book is treasured by scholars
and the public alike. Even today, Chinese people
informally compose couplets (see section 5), in the
style of shi poetry, to celebrate special occasions
such as birthdays. Indeed, NLP techniques have
been applied to generate them automatically (Jiang
and Zhou, 2008).

ciated with Wang due to the similarity of his po-
ems in style and content.
Aside from the dependency relations, word
boundaries and POS tags, the treebank contains a
number of metadata. For each character, the tone
is noted as either level (ping 平) or oblique (ze N).
Each poem is also recorded for its title, author, and
genre, which may be ‘recent-style’ (jintishi iET體詩
) or ‘ancient-style’ (gutishi u體詩).
This choice of our text stems from three motiva-
tions. Classical Chinese is typically written in a
compressed style, especially so with poetry, where
the word order is relatively flexible, and grammati-
cal exceptions are frequent. These characteristics
pose a formidable challenge for students of Classi-
cal Chinese, for whom Tang poetry often forms
part of the introductory material. It is hoped that
this treebank will serve a pedagogical purpose.
Second, this challenging text makes it more likely
that the resulting dependency framework can suc-
cessfully handle other Classical Chinese texts.
Third, Tang poetry is an active area of research in
Chinese philology, and we aspire to contribute to
their endeavor.

4.2 Inter-annotator agreement
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99997092">
Two annotators, both university graduates with a
degree in Chinese, created this treebank. To meas-
ure inter-annotator agreement, we set apart a subset
of about 1050 characters, on which both of them
independently perform three tasks: POS tagging,
head selection, and dependency labeling.
Their agreement rate is 95.1%, 92.3%, and
91.2% for the three respective tasks. For POS tag-
ging, the three main error categories are the confu-
sion between adverbs (AD) and verbs with an
adverbial force, between measure words (M) and
nouns (NN), and between adjectives (JJ) and
nouns. The interested reader is referred to (Lee,
2012) for a detailed analysis.
These differences in POS tags trickle down to
head selection and dependency labeling. In fact, all
words which received different POS tags also re-
ceived different dependency relations. To illus-
trate with a disagreement between adverb and verb,
consider the following sentence. The word 恐
kong ‘afraid’ may be considered as an adverb, ex-
pressing the psychological state for the verb ‘at-
tract’; or, alternatively, as a verb in its own right.
Depending on the decision, it bears either the rela-
tion advmod or root.

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999978230769231">
Some differences are genuine alternative annota-
tions, resulting from a mixture of polysemy and
flexible word order. Consider the sentence 簞食#&apos;
何 dan shi yi he, consisting of four characters
meaning, in order, ‘bowl / blanket’, ‘food’, a copu-
lar or a particle, and ‘what’. If the meaning ‘bowl’
and copular is taken, it means ‘What food is con-
tained in that bowl?’ In this case, the relation clf
is required for 簞 dan, and #&apos; yi is the root word.
Alternatively, if the meaning ‘blanket’ and particle
is taken, it is interpreted as ‘What food is placed on
the blanket?’ Here, dan takes on the relation nn,
and the root word would be 何 he instead.

5.1 Introduction
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999945052631579">
Parallelism in poetry refers to the correspondence
of one line with another; the two lines may bear
similar or opposite meaning, and have comparable
grammatical constructions. This phenomenon is
perhaps most well known in classical Hebrew po-
etry, but it is also one of the defining features of
Chinese poetry; “it pervades their poetry universal-
ly, forms its chief characteristic feature, and is the
source of a great deal of its artificial beauty”, ob-
served Sir John Francis Davis, author of one of the
earliest commentaries on Chinese poetry published
in the West (Davis 1969).
The lines in a Chinese poem almost always con-
tain the same number of characters, most common-
ly either five or seven characters. This exact
equality of the number of characters makes it espe-
cially suited for expressing parallelism, which be-
came a common feature ever since ‘recent-style’
poetry (section 4.1) was developed during the Tang

this style are tonally regulated and assume a high
degree of parallelism within a couplet, i.e., two
adjacent lines. See Figure 1 for an example.

5.2 Methodology

<bodyText confidence="0.99993675862069">
The couplet in Figure 1 is undisputedly symmetric,
both in terms of POS tags and dependency labels.
The definition for parallelism is, however, quite
loose; in general, the corresponding characters
must ‘agree’ in part-of-speech and have related
meaning. These are unavoidably subjective no-
tions.
While a vast amount of Tang poems have been
digitized, they have not been POS-tagged or syn-
tactically analyzed in any significant amount. It is
not surprising, therefore, that no large-scale, em-
pirical study on how, and how often, the characters
‘agree’. There have been a study on 1,000 cou-
plets (Cao, 1998), and another on a small subset of
the poems of Du Mu (Huang, 2006), but neither
clarify the criteria for parallelism. We undertake a
descriptive, rather than prescriptive, approach, us-
ing only the treebank data as the basis.
Character-level parallelism. Even given the
POS tags, this study is not straightforward. The
naive metric of requiring exactly matched POS
tags yields a parallel rate of only 74% in the corpus
as a whole. This figure can be misleading, because
it would vary according to the granularity of the
POS tagset: the more fine-grained it is, the less
agreement there would be. As a metric for paral-
lelism, it has high precision but lower recall, and
would only be appropriate for certain applications
such as couplet generation (Jiang and Zhou, 2008).

By examining portions of the regulated verse
where parallelism is expected, we derived five
‘equivalence sets’ of POS tags, shown in Table 4.
Two tags in the same set are considered parallel,
even though they do not match. In many sets, a tag
needs to be qualified with its dependency relations,
since it is considered parallel to other members in
the set only when it plays certain syntactic roles.
When applying these equivalence sets as well as
exact matching, the parallel rate increases to 87%.
The algorithm is of course not perfect9. It can-
not detect, for example, parallelism involving the
use of a polysemous character with a ‘out-of-
context’ meaning (jieyi ffl&apos; ). For instance, the
character -&apos; zhe, the fourth character in the second
line in the couplet10 “*4NCX RIMM46,”
means ‘person’. On the surface, it does not match
its counterpart, � yan, the fourth character in the
first line, since yan is a sentence particle and zhe is
a noun. However, the poet apparently viewed them
as parallel, because zhe can also function as a sen-
tence particle in other contexts.
Phrase-level parallelism. The character-level
metric, however, still rejects some couplets that
would be deemed parallel by scholars. Most of
these couplets are parallel not at the character lev-
el, but at the phrase level.
A line in a ‘recent-style’ poem is almost always
segmented into two syntactic units (Cai, 1998). A
pentasyllabic (5-character) line is composed of a
disyllabic unit (the first two characters) followed
by a trisyllabic unit (the last three characters)11.
Consider two corresponding disyllabic units, 40-3,W
bao qin ‘hold’ ‘violin’, and A01 sui diao ‘look
down’ ‘fish’. They are tagged as bao/VV qin/NN
and sui/AD diao/VV, respectively. There is a
complete mismatch at the character level: bao is a
verb but sui is an adverb; qin is a noun but diao is
a verb. Taken as a whole, however, both units are
verb phrases describing an activity (‘to hold a vio-
lin’ and ‘to fish while looking down’), and so the
poet likely considered them to be parallel at the
unit, or phrase, level.
9 The quality of these equivalence sets were evaluated on 548
characters. The human expert agrees with the decision of the
algorithm 96.4% of the time at the character level, and 94% of
the time at the phrase level.

5.3 Results
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.990182">
The results are shown in Table 5. All couplets
from an ‘ancient-style’ poem are considered “par-
allelism optional”. A couplet from a ‘recent-style’
poem with eight or more lines12 is either “parallel-
ism not expected”, if it is the first or last couplet in
the poem; or “parallelism expected”, if it is in the
middle of the poem. We first determine whether a
character is parallel to its counterpart in the couplet
at the character level; if not, then we back off to
the phrase level.
In the “parallelism expected” category, the cou-
plets of Wang are highly parallel, at both the char-
acter (91%) and phrase levels (95%). This is
hardly surprising, given that his poems are highly
regarded. It is notable, however, that the propor-
tion is still relatively high (57% at the character
level) even among those couplets for which paral-
lelism is not expected, suggesting that the poet
placed a high view on parallelism. He also em-
ployed much parallelism (64% at the character lev-
el) in ‘ancient-style’ poems, perhaps to aim at a
higher artistic effect.
Among the couplets of Wang which are not par-
allel at the phrase level, the most frequent combi-
nation is a verb phrase matching a noun phrase.
The verb, as the second character, is modified by
an adverb; the noun, also as the second character,
is modified by an adjective. This implies that the
“AD VV” vs. “JJ NN” combination may be con-
sidered to be parallel by poets at the time.
The trends for Meng are similar, with a signifi-
cantly higher score for couplets expected to be par-
allel than those that are not (82% vs. 53% at the
character level). Compared to Wang, however,
both percentages are lower. One wonders if this
has any correlation with Meng being commonly
considered a less accomplished poet. Since the
‘rules’ for parallelism have never been codified,
12 These are known as the ‘regulated verse’ (lushi 律詩) and
are subject to definite patterns of parallelism. Those with
fewer lines are left out, since their patterns are less regular.
Meng may also have simply espoused a more
coarse-grained view of parts-of-speech. This hy-
pothesis would be consistent with the fact that, at
the phrase level, the proportion of parallelism for
Meng is much closer to that for Wang. This sug-
gests that Meng was content with parallelism at the
phrase level and emphasized less on matching
character to character.

6 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999884533333333">
We have presented the first large-scale dependency
treebank of Classical Chinese literature, which en-
codes works by two poets in the Tang Dynasty.
We have described how the dependency grammar
framework has been derived from existing tree-
banks for Modern Chinese, and shown a high level
of inter-annotator agreement. Finally, we have
illustrated the utility of the treebank with a study
on parallelism in Classical Chinese poetry.
Future work will focus on parsing Classical
Chinese poems of other poets, and on enriching the
corpus with semantic information, which would
facilitate not only deeper study of parallelism but
also other topics such as imagery and metaphorical
coherence (Zhu and Cui, 2010).

The most widely used treebank for Modern Chinese, the Penn Chinese Treebank (Xue et al., 2005), belongs to the former kind. Rather than encoding constituency information, dependency grammars give information about grammatical relations between words. Modern Chinese has been analyzed in this framework, for example at Stanford University (Chang et al., 2009). The dependency relations follow the design principles of those initially applied to English (de Marneffe and Manning, 2008), with a few added relations to accommodate Chinese-specific features, such as the “ba”-construction. Their POS tagset is borrowed from that of the Penn Chinese Treebank. 2.2 Classical Chinese Like its modern counterpart, two pre-requisites for constructing a Classical Chinese treebank are word segmentation and part-of-speech tagging.

The two lines are perfectly parallel both in terms of POS and dependencies. A dependency framework is chosen for two reasons. First, words in Classical Chinese poems, our target text (section 4), tend to have relatively free word order. Dependency grammars can handle this phenomenon well. Second, our treebank is expected to be used pedagogically, and we expect explicit grammatical relations between words to be helpful to students. These relations also encode 1 From Wang Wei 《奉和聖制御春明樓臨右相園亭賦樂賢 M應制D 192 semantic information, which lend themselves to meaning extraction applications. Our set of d</context>

In particular, prepositions are rare2; instead, nouns expressing time, locations, instruments, indirect recipients, etc., modify the verb directly. This phenomenon prompted the introduction of two new relations “locative modifiers” (section 3.1) and “oblique objects” (section 3.2); and the re-instatement of two relations, “noun phrases as adverbial modifiers” (section 3.3) and “indirect objects”, from the Stanford dependencies (de Marneffe and Manning, 2008) that are excluded from the Modern Chinese variant (Chang et al., 2009) .

The iobj label exists in Stanford English dependencies (de Marneffe and Manning, 2008), but was not included in the Modern Chinese version (Chang et al., 2009), likely due to its infrequent appearance in Modern Chinese. It is re-instated in our Classical Chinese treebank. Sentence (3) in Table 2 provides an example, with ‘word’ as the direct object and ‘person’ as the indirect. 3.5 Absence of copular verbs In a copular construction such as “A is B”, A is considered the “topic” (top) of the copular verb “is” (Chang et al., 2009). The copular, however, is rarely used in Classical Chinese (Pulleyblank, 1995). In some cases, it is replaced by an adverb that functions as a copular verb. If so, that adverb is POS-tagged as such (VC) in our treebank, and the dependency tree structure is otherwise normal. In other cases, the copular is absent altogether. Rather than inserting implicit nodes as in (Haug and Jøhndal, 2008), we expand the usage of the top relation. It usually connects the subject (“A”) to the copular, but would in this case connect it with the noun predicate (“B”) instead. In the example sentence below, the re</context>

They come in a variety of languages and genres, from Old English (Taylor et al., 2003) to Early New High German (Demske et al., 2004) and Medieval Portuguese (Rocio et al. 2000); and from poetry (Pintzuk &amp; Leendert, 2001) to religious texts such as the New Testament (Haug &amp; Jøhndal, 2008) and the Quran (Dukes &amp; Buckwalter, 2010). They are increasingly being leveraged in teaching (Crane et al., 2009) and in research (Lancaster, 2010). This paper describes the first large-scale dependency treebank for Classical Chinese.

This phenomenon is perhaps most well known in classical Hebrew poetry, but it is also one of the defining features of Chinese poetry; “it pervades their poetry universally, forms its chief characteristic feature, and is the source of a great deal of its artificial beauty”, observed Sir John Francis Davis, author of one of the earliest commentaries on Chinese poetry published in the West (Davis 1969). The lines in a Chinese poem almost always contain the same number of characters, most commonly either five or seven characters. This exact equality of the number of characters makes it especially suited for expressing parallelism, which became a common feature ever since ‘recent-style’ poetry (section 4.1) was developed during the Tang 8 From Wang Wei 《贈從弟司庫員外絿弟》 196 Dynasty. Unlike those in ‘ancient-style’, poems of this style are tonally regulated and assume a high degree of parallelism within a couplet, i.e., two adjacent lines.

The most widely used treebank for Modern Chinese, the Penn Chinese Treebank (Xue et al., 2005), belongs to the former kind. Rather than encoding constituency information, dependency grammars give information about grammatical relations between words. Modern Chinese has been analyzed in this framework, for example at Stanford University (Chang et al., 2009). The dependency relations follow the design principles of those initially applied to English (de Marneffe and Manning, 2008), with a few added relations to accommodate Chinese-specific features, such as the “ba”-construction.

To mark these nouns, we created the “locative modifier” relation (lmod). Consider sentence (1) in Table 2. Although the word “hill” occupies the position normally reserved for the subject, it actually indicates a location, and is therefore assigned the lmod relation. In sentence (2), the locative noun ‘alley’ is placed after the verb. 3.2 Oblique objects Oblique objects are a well-known category in the analysis of ancient Indo-European languages, for example Latin and ancient Greek. In the PROIEL treebank (Haug and Jøhndal, 2008), for example, the “oblique” (obl) relation marks arguments of the verb which are not subjects or non-accusative ‘objects’. These are most commonly nouns in the dative or ablative case, as well as prepositional phrases. It is believed that oblique objects exist in Classical Chinese, but have been replaced by prepositional phrases in Modern Chinese (Li and Li, 1986). The obl relation is imported to our treebank to mark nouns that directly modify a verb to express means, instrument, and respect, similar to the functions of datives and ablatives. They typically come after the verb. In sentence (6</context>

The copular, however, is rarely used in Classical Chinese (Pulleyblank, 1995). In some cases, it is replaced by an adverb that functions as a copular verb. If so, that adverb is POS-tagged as such (VC) in our treebank, and the dependency tree structure is otherwise normal. In other cases, the copular is absent altogether. Rather than inserting implicit nodes as in (Haug and Jøhndal, 2008), we expand the usage of the top relation. It usually connects the subject (“A”) to the copular, but would in this case connect it with the noun predicate (“B”) instead. In the example sentence below, the relation top(‘capable’, ‘general’) would be assigned. �� � � � ‘general’ ‘weapon’ ‘warehouse’ ‘capable’ The general [is] a capable manager of the arsenal5. 194 3.6 Discourse relations Two clauses may be connected by a discourse relation, such as causal or temporal.

The definition for parallelism is, however, quite loose; in general, the corresponding characters must ‘agree’ in part-of-speech and have related meaning. These are unavoidably subjective notions. While a vast amount of Tang poems have been digitized, they have not been POS-tagged or syntactically analyzed in any significant amount. It is not surprising, therefore, that no large-scale, empirical study on how, and how often, the characters ‘agree’. There have been a study on 1,000 couplets (Cao, 1998), and another on a small subset of the poems of Du Mu (Huang, 2006), but neither clarify the criteria for parallelism.

In the past decade, Humanities scholars have begun to use digital corpora for the study of ancient languages and historical texts. They come in a variety of languages and genres, from Old English (Taylor et al., 2003) to Early New High German (Demske et al., 2004) and Medieval Portuguese (Rocio et al. 2000); and from poetry (Pintzuk &amp; Leendert, 2001) to religious texts such as the New Testament (Haug &amp; Jøhndal, 2008) and the Quran (Dukes &amp; Buckwalter, 2010). They are increasingly being leveraged in teaching (Crane et al., 2009) and in research (Lancaster, 2010). This paper describes the first large-scale dependency treebank for Classical Chinese. The treebank consists of poems from the Tang Dynasty (618 – 907 CE), considered one of the crowning achievements in traditional Chinese literature.

In English, these relations may be explicitly realized, most commonly by discourse connectives, such as ‘because’ or ‘when’. Even in the absence of these connectives, however, two adjacent clauses can still hold an implicit discourse relation. A detailed study, which resulted in the Penn Discourse Treebank (Prasad et al., 2008), found that explicit relations outnumber implicit ones in English, but the latter is nonetheless quite common and can be annotated with high inter-annotator agreement.

This condensed style of expression often erects a barrier for understanding. Although the focus of the treebank is on syntax rather than discourse, we decided to annotate these relations. Implicit connectives are more difficult to achieve interannotator agreement (Prasad et al., 2008); since they are mostly implicit in Classical Chinese, we adopted a coarse-grained classification system, rather than the hierarchical system of sense tags in the Penn Discourse Treebank. More precisely, it contains only the four categories posited by (Wang, 2003) --- causal, concessive, temporal, and conditional. Table 3 gives some examples. When it is impossible to determine the discourse relation between two lines, the default “dependent” (dep) label is assigned. This label is originally used when “the system is unable to determine a more precise dependency relation between two words” (de M</context>

(Pulleyblank, 1995). (e.g., ‘today’). For the latter case, the bare noun phrase is considered a “temporal modifier” in a tmod relation with the verb in (de Marneffe and Manning, 2008). Similarly, to indicate locations, a preposition is normally required in English (e.g., ‘on the hill’). However, in Classical Chinese, the preposition is frequently omitted, with the bare locative noun phrase modifying the verb directly. To mark these nouns, we created the “locative modifier” relation (lmod). Consider sentence (1) in Table 2.

The iobj label exists in Stanford English dependencies (de Marneffe and Manning, 2008), but was not included in the Modern Chinese version (Chang et al., 2009), likely due to its infrequent appearance in Modern Chinese. It is re-instated in our Classical Chinese treebank. Sentence (3) in Table 2 provides an example, with ‘word’ as the direct object and ‘person’ as the indirect. 3.5 Absence of copular verbs In a copular construction such as “A is B”, A is considered the “topic” (top) of the copular verb “is” (Chang et al., 2009). The copular, however, is rarely used in Classical Chinese (Pulleyblank, 1995). In some cases, it is replaced by an adverb that functions as a copular verb. If so, that adverb is POS-tagged as such (VC) in our treebank, and the dependency tree structure is otherwise normal. In other cases, the copular is absent altogether. Rather than inserting implicit nodes as in (Haug and Jøhndal, 2008), we expand the usage of the top relation. It usually connects the subject (“A”) to the copular, but would in this case connect it with the noun predicate (“B”) instead. In the example sentence below, the relation top(‘capable’, ‘general’) would be assigned. �� � � � ‘general’ ‘weapon’</context>

In many ancient languages, explicit realization of discourse relations is less frequent. In Latin and Ancient Greek, for instance, these connectives are often replaced by a participial clause. The participle is marked only by the genitive or ablative case, leaving the reader to decide from context how it relates to the main clause. As a non-inflectional language, Classical Chinese cannot use this device, and instead typically constructs a complex sentence with a series of verbs without any marking (Pulleyblank, 1995). For example, sentence (2) in 5 From Meng Haoran ((4M4rTr N1f_)) 6 From top to bottom, Meng Haoran ((�SOVf-W)),((94 , MM), and Du Fu &amp;ff((life)) Table 3 literally says ‘not capable, good ruler forsake’; the onus is put on the reader to interpret the first two characters to form a clause that provides the reason for the rest of the line.

The most widely used treebank for Modern Chinese, the Penn Chinese Treebank (Xue et al., 2005), belongs to the former kind. Rather than encoding constituency information, dependency grammars give information about grammatical relations between words. Modern Chinese has been analyzed in this framework, for example at Stanford University (Chang et al., 2009). The dependency relations follow the design principles of those initially applied to English (de Marneffe and Manning, 2008), with a few added relations to accommodate Chinese-specific features, such as the “ba”-construction.

The two lines are perfectly parallel both in terms of POS and dependencies. A dependency framework is chosen for two reasons. First, words in Classical Chinese poems, our target text (section 4), tend to have relatively free word order. Dependency grammars can handle this phenomenon well. Second, our treebank is expected to be used pedagogically, and we expect explicit grammatical relations between words to be helpful to students.

To measure inter-annotator agreement, we set apart a subset of about 1050 characters, on which both of them independently perform three tasks: POS tagging, head selection, and dependency labeling. Their agreement rate is 95.1%, 92.3%, and 91.2% for the three respective tasks. For POS tagging, the three main error categories are the confusion between adverbs (AD) and verbs with an adverbial force, between measure words (M) and nouns (NN), and between adjectives (JJ) and nouns. The interested reader is referred to (Lee, 2012) for a detailed analysis. These differences in POS tags trickle down to head selection and dependency labeling. In fact, all words which received different POS tags also received different dependency relations. To illustrate with a disagreement between adverb and verb, consider the following sentence. The word 恐 kong ‘afraid’ may be considered as an adverb, expressing the psychological state for the verb ‘attract’; or, alternatively, as a verb in its own right. Depending on the decision, it bears either the relation advmod or root. 恐 M 負 時 累 ‘afraid’ ‘attract’ ‘burden’ ‘fame’ ‘affect’ [I am] a</context>
