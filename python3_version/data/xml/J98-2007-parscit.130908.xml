The past three decades have seen a steady growth of interest in corpus-based tech-
niques for speech and natural language processing. Beginning with the success of the
early Markov chain—based speech recognition systems (Jelinek 1998) and continuing
with the work done in information extraction as part of the Message Understanding
Conferences (http://www.muc.saic.com), corpus-based speech and language process-
ing have flourished. Such techniques are widely considered to be the primary means
of developing broad-coverage speech and language systems that can be ported to dif-
ferent domains. As such, the range of corpus-based techniques and their applications
have expanded greatly in the past decade.
Corpus-Based Methods in Language and Speech Processing edited by Steve Young and
Gerrit Bloothooft is a compilation of works presented during a two-week course at the
2nd European Summer School on Language and Speech Communication held in 1994
in Utrecht. The book promises to offer an in-depth introduction to the field of corpus
linguistics that is both accessible to newcomers and valuable to practitioners. While
the book represents an interesting attempt to meet this ambitious objective, it falls
short in at least two significant ways: (1) it fails to adequately survey the full range of
the field; and, more importantly, (2) the material is often presented in a manner that
is not tailored to the needs of a newcomer. The book does provide a mathematically
rigorous presentation of a core set of primarily statistical techniques in both speech
and natural language processing and would be a valuable reference for practitioners.
The material is organized into six loosely coupled chapters, each written by a dif-
ferent set of authors. The notation varies slightly between chapters, as does the style of
presentation. Chapter 1 by Hermann Ney illustrates the role of statistics in the context
of automated speech and language processing. It is a somewhat loosely structured
discussion of such topics as Bayes&apos;s decision theory and the EM algorithm in the con-
text of applications such as speech recognition and text translation. The mathematical
presentations are formal but lack intuitive appeal and may be tedious and difficult
for a newcomer to assimilate. There is also a lack of discussion of basic concepts; for
example, the concept of stochastic independence is not explicitly discussed. At the
same time, the chapter admirably demonstrates the unity in the formulation of some
of the basic methodologies applied to natural language processing.
Computational Linguistics Volume 24, Number 2
Chapter 2 is by Kate Knill and Steve Young. It provides an extensive survey of
speech recognition methodologies based on hidden Markov models. The survey is
thorough, but the presentation is not easy to read and has few illustrative examples.
Formulae and descriptions occasionally make use of terms and symbols that are not
defined for the newcomer.
Egidio Giachin and Scott McGlashan present a spoken-language dialogue sys-
tem in Chapter 3. Such a system represents the ultimate application of combined
automated speech and language technology. The system described was developed as
part of the ESPRIT SUNDIAL project (Peckham 1991) and is a combination of hidden
Markov model—based speech recognition and rule-based natural language understand-
ing. The system is presented with adequate clarity and detail to allow appreciation of
the problems addressed and the methodologies applied to their solution, although the
discussion of competing methodology is very limited.
Part-of-speech tagging and partial parsing are discussed by Steven Abney in Chap-
ter 4. The focus of this chapter is primarily on rule-based systems. The survey is
thorough and makes a number of interesting points. For example, Abney notes the
impact of a Zipfian distribution on evaluation results when discussing taggers; he also
provides a good discussion of the longest-match rule when describing partial parsing.
Chapter 5 by Rens Bod and Remko Scha is a carefully written and enjoyable pre-
sentation of the formulation of stochastic tree-substitution grammars from a database
of labeled trees. Three approaches of increasing complexity are described and evalu-
ated. The third and final approach makes use of the Good—Turing method for estimat-
ing the probability of unseen events.
In the final chapter, Hermann Ney, Sven Martin, and Frank Wessel describe meth-
ods for estimating the probability of unseen events in n-gram models. Although math-
ematically complete, the presentation is difficult to follow and may not be accessible
to a typical newcomer.
In summary, the book is well worth reading, although it may not deliver all that it
promises. It is a technically sound survey of several of the most widely used techniques
in (primarily statistical) corpus-based speech and natural language processing. It also
contains an extensive bibliography. Unfortunately, its use as a reference is diminished
by the lack of an index.
