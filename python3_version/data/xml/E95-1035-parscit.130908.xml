We describe a method for analysing
the temporal structure of a discourse
which takes into account the effects
of tense, aspect, temporal adverbials
and rhetorical structure and which
minimises unnecessary ambiguity in
the temporal structure. It is part
of a discourse grammar implemented
in Carpenter&apos;s ALE formalism. The
method for building up the tempo-
ral structure of the discourse com-
bines constraints and preferences: we
use constraints to reduce the number
of possible structures, exploiting the
HPSG type hierarchy and unification
for this purpose; and we apply prefer-
ences to choose between the remain-
ing options using a temporal center-
ing mechanism. We end by recom-
mending that an underspecified repre-
sentation of the structure using these
techniques be used to avoid generat-
ing the temporal/rhetorical structure
until higher-level information can be
used to disambiguate.
the temporal component were to yield a de-
tailed representation of the temporal structure
of the discourse, taking into account the effect
of tense, aspect and temporal expressions while
at the same time minimising unnecessary am-
biguity in the temporal structure. The method
combines a constraint-based approach with an
approach based on preferences: we exploit the
HPSG type hierarchy and unification to arrive at
a temporal structure using constraints placed
on that structure by tense, aspect, rhetorical
structure and temporal expressions, and we use
the temporal centering preferences described
by (Kameyama et al., 1993; Poesio, 1994) to
rate the possibilities for temporal structure and
choose the best among them.
The starting point for this work was Scha
and Polanyi&apos;s discourse grammar (Scha &amp;
Polanyi 1988; Priist et a/ 1994). For the
implementation we extended the HPSG gram-
mar (Pollard and Sag, 1994) which Gerald
Penn and Bob Carpenter first encoded in
ALE (Carpenter, 1993). This paper will focus
on our temporal processing algorithm, and in
particular on our analysis of narrative progres-
sion, rhetorical structure, perfects and tempo-
ral expressions.

2 Constraints on narrative
continuations

<bodyText confidence="0.9996375">
Probably the best known algorithm for track-
ing narrative progression is that developed
by Kamp (1979), Hinrichs (1981), and Par-
tee (1984), which formalises the observation
that an event will occur just after a preceding
event, while a state will overlap with a pre-
ceding event. This algorithm gives the correct
results in examples such as the following:
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.995325">
253
</page>
<listItem confidence="0.983581333333333">
(1) John entered the room. Mary stood up.
(2) John entered the room. Mary was
seated behind the desk.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9986184">
In (1) the event of Mary&apos;s standing is under-
stood to occur just after John enters the room,
while in (2) the state in which Mary is seated is
understood to overlap with the event of John&apos;s
entering the room.
However, if there is a rhetorical relationship
between two eventualities such as causation,
elaboration or enablement, the temporal de-
faults can be overridden, as in the following
examples:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.824012">
(3) a. John fell. Mary pushed him.
b. Local builders constructed the Ford
St. Bridge. They used 3 tons of
bricks.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999448709677419">
In (3a) there is a causal relationship between
Mary&apos;s pushing John and his falling, and the
second event is understood to precede the first.
In (3b), the second sentence is an elaboration
of the first, and they therefore refer to aspects
of the same event rather than to two sequential
events.
It has been suggested that only world knowl-
edge allows one to detect that the default is
being overridden here. For example, Lascarides
&amp; Asher (1991) suggest that general knowledge
postulates (in the case of (3a): that a pushing
can cause a falling) can be invoked to generate
the backward movement reading.
The problem for practical systems is twofold:
we could assume that in the case of narrative
the Kamp/Hinrichs/Partee algorithm is the de-
fault, but each time the default is applied we
would need to check all our available world
knowledge to see whether there isn&apos;t a world
knowledge postulate which might be overriding
this assumption. Clearly this would make the
processing of text a very expensive operation.
An alternative is to assume that the tempo-
ral ordering between events in two consecutive
sentences can be any of the four possibilities
(just_after, precede, same-event and overlap).
But then the resulting temporal structures will
be highly ambiguous even in small discourses.
And sometimes this ambiguity is unwarranted.
Consider:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.6999015">
(4) Mary stared at John. He gave her back
her slice of pizza.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999911461538462">
Here, it would appear, only one reading is pos-
sible, i.e. the one where John gave Mary her
slice of pizza just after she stared or started to
stare at him. It would be undesirable for the
temporal processing mechanism to postulate an
ambiguity in this case.
Of course, sometimes it is possible to take
advantage of certain cue words which either in-
dicate or constrain the rhetorical relation. For
example, in (5) the order of the events is un-
derstood to be the reverse of that in (1) due
to the cue word because which signals a causal
relationship between the events:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.908779">
(5) John entered the room because Mary
stood up.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9828755">
As Kehler (1994) points out, if forward move-
ment of time is considered a default with con-
secutive event sentences, then the use of &amp;quot;be-
cause&amp;quot; in (5) should cause a temporal clashâ€”
whereas it is perfectly felicitous. Temporal
expressions such as at noon and the previous
Thursday can have a similar effect: they too
can override the default temporal relations and
place constraints on tense. In (6), for exam-
ple, the default interpretation would be that
John&apos;s being in Detroit overlaps with his being
in Boston, but the phrase the previous Thurs-
day overrides this, giving the interpretation
that John&apos;s being in Detroit precedes his be-
ing in Boston:
(6) John was in Boston. The previous
Thursday he was in Detroit.
This suggests that the temporal information
given by tense acts as a weaker constraint on
temporal structure than the information given
by temporal adverbials.
The possibilities for rhetorical relations (e.g.,
whether something is narration, or elaboration,
or a causal relation) can be further constrained
by aspect. For example, a state can elaborate
another state or an event:
</bodyText>

(7) a. Mary was tired. She was exhausted.

But an event can only elaborate another event,

<bodyText confidence="0.999752827586207">
For the eventive second sentence of (8b) to be
an elaboration of the first sentence, it must oc-
cur in a stative formâ€”for example as a progres-
sive (i.e., She was building a dog house).
Because of considerations like these, our aim
in the implementation work was to treat tense,
aspect, cue words and rhetorical relations as
mutually constraining, with more specific infor-
mation such as explicit cue words having higher
priority than less specific information such as
tense. The main advantage of this approach is
that it reduces temporal structure ambiguity
without having to rely on detailed world knowl-
edge postulates.
Table 1 lists the possible temporal relations
between the eventualities described by two con-
secutive sentences without temporal expres-
sions or cue words, where the first sentence
(Si) may have any tense and aspect and the
second sentence (S2) expresses a simple past
event. We constrain S2 in this way because of
lack of space; additional constraints are given
in (Hitzeman et al., 1994). For example, if
a simple past eventive sentence follows a sim-
ple past eventive sentence the second event can
be understood to occur just after the first, to
precede the first or to refer to the same event
as the first (an elaboration relation), but the
two events cannot overlap; these constraints

<bodyText confidence="0.999981666666667">
are weaker, however, than explicit clues such
as cue words to rhetorical relations and tempo-
ral expressions. When Si expresses a state, it
is possible for the temporal relation to hold be-
tween the event described by S2 and the event
or activity most closely preceding Si, i.e., the
temporal focus of Si, here referred to as TF1.1
However, we haven&apos;t solved the problem
completely at this point: although tense can
provide a further constraint on the temporal
structure of such discourses, it can also add a
further ambiguity. Consider (9):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.898915">
(9) Sam rang the bell. He had lost the key.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.993639">
Clearly, the event described by the past perfect
sentence must precede the event described by
the first, simple past sentence. However, if a
third sentence is added, an ambiguity results.
Consider the following possible continuations
of (9):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9975565">
(10) a. ...Hannah opened the door.
b. ...It fell through a hole in his pocket.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.973155128571429">
The temporal relation between these continu-
ations and the portion of earlier text they at-
tach to is constrained along the lines sketched
before. The problem here is determining which
thread in (9) they continue; (10a) continues the
thread in which Sam rings the bell, but (10b)
continues the thread in which Sam loses the
key.
A further ambiguity is that when the third
sentence is past perfect, it may be a continua-
tion of a preceding thread or the start of a new
thread itself. Consider:
(11) a. Sam rang the bell. He had lost the
key. It had fallen through a hole in
his pocket.
b. John got to work late. He had left
the house at 8. He had eaten a big
breakfast.
In (a) the third sentence continues the thread
about losing the key; in (b) the third starts a
In this chart it appears that whether the tense
is simple past or past perfect makes no difference,
and that only aspect affects the possible tempo-
ral relations between Si and S2. However, it is
important not to ignore tense because other com-
binations of tense and aspect do show that tense
affects which relations are possible, e.g., a simple
past stative S2 cannot have a precede relation with
any Si, while a past perfect stative S2 can.
new thread.2
For the problem with multi-sentence dis-
courses, and the &amp;quot;threads&amp;quot; that sentences con-
tinue, we use an implementation of tempo-
ral centering (Kameyama et al., 1993; Poesio,
1994). This is a technique similar to the type of
centering used for nominal anaphora (Sidner,
1983; Grosz et al., 1983). Centering assumes
that discourse understanding requires some no-
tion of &amp;quot;aboutness.&amp;quot; While nominal centering
assumes there is one object that the current dis-
course is &amp;quot;about,&amp;quot; temporal centering assumes
that there is one thread that the discourse is
currently following, and that, in addition to
tense and aspect constraints, there is a prefer-
ence for a new utterance to continue a thread
which has a parallel tense or which is seman-
tically related to it and a preference to con-
tinue the current thread rather than switching
to another thread. Kameyama et a/. (1993)
confirmed these preferences when testing their
ideas on the Brown corpus.
As an example of how the temporal centering
preference techniques can reduce ambiguity, re-
call example (9) and the possible continuations
shown in (10). The difficulty in these examples
is determining whether the third sentence con-
tinues the thread begun by the first or second
sentence. For example, in (10a) the preference
technique which allows us to choose the first
thread over the second is one which assigns a
higher rating to a thread whose tense is parallel
to that of the new sentence; in this case both
Sam rang the bell and Hannah opened the door
are in the simple past tense. In example (10b)
the fact that the key is mentioned only in the
second sentence of (9) links (10b) with the sec-
ond thread. To handle an example like (12), we
employ a preference for relating a sentence to
a thread that has content words that are rated
as semantically &amp;quot;close&amp;quot; to that of the sentence:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.5914905">
(12) Sam rang the bell. He had lost the key.
His keyring bioke.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9945114">
We store semantic patterns between words as a
cheap and quick form of world knowledge; these
&apos;We will not discuss the additional problem that
if the final sentence in (11b) is the end of the text,
the text is probably ill-formed. This is because
a well-formed text should not leave threads &amp;quot;dan-
gling&amp;quot; or unfinished. This is probably also the rea-
son for the awkwardness of the well-known exam-
ple Max poured a cup of coffee. He had entered the
room.

patterns are easier to provide than are the de-
tailed world knowledge postulates required in
some other approaches, and result in similar
and sometimes more precise temporal struc-
tures with less processing overhead. Using
the semantic patterns we know that key and
keyrzng are semantically close, and through
that semantic link between the second and
third sentences we prefer to connect the third
sentence to the thread begun by the second.&apos;
The approach to representing semantic rela-
tionships we take is one used by Morris &amp;
Hirst (1991) wherein the words in the lexicon
are associated with each other in a thesaurus-
like fashion and given a rating according to how
semantically &amp;quot;close&amp;quot; they are. We thus avoid
relying on high-level inferences and very spe-
cific world knowledge postulates, our goal being
to determine the temporal structure as much as
possible prior to the application of higher-level
inferences.
3 An HPSG implementation of a
discourse grammar
Following Scha &amp; Polanyi (1988) and Priist
et al (1994), our model of discourse consists
of units called Discourse Constituent Units
(Deus) which are related by various temporal
and rhetorical relations. A basic DCU repre-
sents a sentence (or clause), and complex Dcus
are built up from basic and complex Dcus.
In our ALE implementation, a DCU contains
the following slots for temporal information;
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.745438921052632">
CUE_WORD: Cues to rhetorical structure, e.g.,
&amp;quot;because.&amp;quot;
V_AND_NP_LIST: Contains content words found
in this DCU, and is used to compare the
content words of the current DCU with

ples (9) â€” (10) because there is as stronga relation-
ship between door and bell as there is between door
and key.
those in previous threads, in order to rate
the semantic &amp;quot;closeness&amp;quot; of the DCU to
each thread.
SEM_ASPECT: Contains the semantic aspect
(event, state, activity). We have extended
the Penn &amp; Carpenter implementation of
the HPSG grammar so that semantic aspect
is calculated compositionally (and stored
here).
RHET_FtELN: The relation between this DCU
and a previous one. Lexical items and
phrases such as cue words (stored in
CUE_WORD) affect the value of this slot.
TEMP _CENTER: Used for temporal centering;
Keeps track of the thread currently be-
ing followed (since there is a preference for
continuing the current thread) and all the
threads that have been constructed so far
in the discourse.
FWD_CENTER: Existing threads

ing followed
CLOSED_THREADS: Threads no longer
available for continuation
TEMP_EXPR_RELNS: Stores the semantic inter-
pretation of temporal expressions associ-
ated with this DCU.
TEMP_RELNS: Stores the temporal relations
between the eventualities in the discourse.

TEMPFOC: The most recent event in the cur-
rent thread which a subsequent eventuality

To allow the above-mentioned types of infor-
mation to mutually constrain each other, we
employ a hierarchy of rhetorical and tempo-
ral relations (illustrated in Figure 1), using the
ALE system in such a way that clues such as
tense and cue words work together to reduce
the number of possible temporal structures.
This approach improves upon earlier work on
discourse structure such as (Lascarides and
Asher, 1991) and (Kehler, 1994) in reducing
the number of possible ambiguities; it is also
more precise than the Kamp/Hinrichs/Partee
approach in that it takes into account ways
in which the apparent defaults can be overrid-
den and differentiates between events and ac-
tivities, which behave differently in narrative
progression.
Tense, aspect, rhetorical relations and tem-
poral expressions affect the value of the
RHET_RELN type that expresses the relation-
ship between two Dcus: cue words are lexically
marked according to what rhetorical relation
they specify, and this relation is passed on to
the DCU. Explicit relation markers such as cue
words and temporal relations must be consis-
tent and take priority over indicators such as
tense and aspect. For example, sentence (13)
will be ruled out because the cue phrase as a re-
sult conflicts with the temporal expression ten
minutes earlier:
(13) #Mary pushed John and as a result ten
minutes earlier he fell.
On the other hand, if temporal expressions in-
dicate an overlap relation and cue words indi-
cate a background relation as in (14), these con-
tributions are consistent and the RHET_RELN
type will contain a background value (the more
specific value of the two):

For reasons of space it is difficult to give ex-
amples of the sign-based output of the gram-
mar, or of the ALE rules, so we will restrict
ourselves here to a summary of the algorithm
and to a very limited rendition of the system
output. The algorithm used for calculating the
temporal structure of a discourse can be sum-
marised as follows. It consists of two parts, the
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.902801761904762">
constraint-based portion and the preference-
based portion:
1. The possible temporal/rhetorical relations
are constrained.
(a) If there is a temporal expression, it
determines the temporal relationship
of the new DCU to the previous ones,
and defaults are ignored.
(b) Lexical items such as cue words influ-
ence the value of the RHET-RELN type
(See Figure 1).
(c)- If steps (a) and (b) attempt to place
conflicting values in the RHET_RELN
slot, the parse will fail.
(d) If there is no temporal expression or
cue phrase, tense and semantic as-
pect also influence the value of the
RHET-RELN type (See Table 1), so
that rhetorical relations, tense and as-
pect constrain each other.
2. If more than one possibility exists, seman-
tic preferences are used to choose between
the possibilities.
(a) A &amp;quot;semantic distance&amp;quot; rating between
the new DCU and each previous thread
is determined. (If there are no exist-
ing threads a new thread is started.)
(b) Other preferences, such as a prefer-
ence for relating the new DCU to a
thread with parallel tense, are em-
ployed (See (Kameyama et al., 1993;
Poesio, 1994) for details), and the re-
sulting ratings are factored into the
rating for each thread.
(c) If the thread currently being followed
is among the highest rated threads,
this thread is continued. (This corre-
sponds to temporal centering&apos;s prefer-
ence to continue the current thread.)
(d) If not, the DCU may continue any of
the highest rated threads, and each of
these solutions is generated.

Those observations are summarised below. In

Using this algorithm, we can precisely iden-

as in (15):
(15) John fell (et) because Mary pushed him
(e2).
TEMP_RELNS: e2 precedes el
We can also narrow the possibilities when no
cue word is present by using constraints based
on observations of tense and aspect interactions
such as those shown in Table 1. For example, if
Dcui represents a simple past eventive sentence
and Dcu2 a past perfect eventive sentence, then
in spite of the lack of rhetorical cues we know
that e2 precedes e1, as in (16):

If we allow any of the four possible temporal
relations between events, both continuations of
sentence (17) would have 17 readings (4 x 4 Â±
1 reading in which the third sentence begins a
new thread). Using constraints, we reduce the
number of readings to 4. Using preferences,
we reduce that to 2 readings for each continua-
tion. The correct temporal relations are shown

By using constraints and preferences, we can
considerably reduce the amount of ambiguity
in the temporal/rhetorical structure of a dis-
course. However, explicit cues to rhetorical and
temporal relations are not always available, and
these cases result in more ambiguity than is de-
sirable when processing large discourses.
Consider, however, that instead of generat-
ing all the possible temporal/rhetorical struc-
tures, we could use the information available to
fill in the most restrictive type possible in the
type hierarchy of temporal/rhetorical relations
shown in Figure 1. We can then avoid generat-
ing the structures until higher-level information
can be applied to complete the disambiguation
process.

that it treats tense, aspect, temporal adverbials
and rhetorical relations as mutually constrain-
ing; it postulates less ambiguity than current
temporal structuring algorithms do; and it uses
semantic closeness and other preference tech-
niques rather than full-fledged world knowl-
edge postulates to determine preferences over
remaining ambiguities. We also recommended
using an underspecified representation of tem-

<abstract confidence="0.998106660377359">We describe a method for analysing the temporal structure of a discourse which takes into account the effects of tense, aspect, temporal adverbials and rhetorical structure and which minimises unnecessary ambiguity in the temporal structure. It is part of a discourse grammar implemented Carpenter&apos;s The method for building up the temporal structure of the discourse combines constraints and preferences: we use constraints to reduce the number of possible structures, exploiting the hierarchy and unification for this purpose; and we apply preferences to choose between the remaining options using a temporal centering mechanism. We end by recommending that an underspecified representation of the structure using these techniques be used to avoid generating the temporal/rhetorical structure until higher-level information can be used to disambiguate. the temporal component were to yield a detailed representation of the temporal structure of the discourse, taking into account the effect of tense, aspect and temporal expressions while at the same time minimising unnecessary ambiguity in the temporal structure. The method combines a constraint-based approach with an approach based on preferences: we exploit the hierarchy and unification to arrive at a temporal structure using constraints placed on that structure by tense, aspect, rhetorical structure and temporal expressions, and we use centering described by (Kameyama et al., 1993; Poesio, 1994) to rate the possibilities for temporal structure and choose the best among them. The starting point for this work was Scha and Polanyi&apos;s discourse grammar (Scha &amp; 1988; Priist 1994). For the we extended the grammar (Pollard and Sag, 1994) which Gerald Penn and Bob Carpenter first encoded in 1993).

The main advantage of this approach is that it reduces temporal structure ambiguity without having to rely on detailed world knowledge postulates. Table 1 lists the possible temporal relations between the eventualities described by two consecutive sentences without temporal expressions or cue words, where the first sentence (Si) may have any tense and aspect and the second sentence (S2) expresses a simple past event. We constrain S2 in this way because of lack of space; additional constraints are given in (Hitzeman et al., 1994). For example, if a simple past eventive sentence follows a simple past eventive sentence the second event can be understood to occur just after the first, to precede the first or to refer to the same event as the first (an elaboration relation), but the two events cannot overlap; these constraints 255 are weaker, however, than explicit clues such as cue words to rhetorical relations and temporal expressions. When Si expresses a state, it is possible for the temporal relation to hold between the event described by S2 and the event or activity most closely preceding Si, i.e., the temporal focus</context>

(a) A &amp;quot;semantic distance&amp;quot; rating between the new DCU and each previous thread is determined. (If there are no existing threads a new thread is started.) (b) Other preferences, such as a preference for relating the new DCU to a thread with parallel tense, are employed (See (Kameyama et al., 1993; Poesio, 1994) for details), and the resulting ratings are factored into the rating for each thread.

It would be undesirable for the temporal processing mechanism to postulate an ambiguity in this case. Of course, sometimes it is possible to take advantage of certain cue words which either indicate or constrain the rhetorical relation. For example, in (5) the order of the events is understood to be the reverse of that in (1) due to the cue word because which signals a causal relationship between the events: (5) John entered the room because Mary stood up. As Kehler (1994) points out, if forward movement of time is considered a default with consecutive event sentences, then the use of &amp;quot;because&amp;quot; in (5) should cause a temporal clashâ€” whereas it is perfectly felicitous. Temporal expressions such as at noon and the previous Thursday can have a similar effect: they too can override the default temporal relations and place constraints on tense. In (6), for example, the default interpretation would be that John&apos;s being in Detroit overlaps with his being in Boston, but the phrase the previous Thursday overrides this, giving the interpretation that John&apos;s being in Detro</context>

Mary pushed him. b. Local builders constructed the Ford St. Bridge. They used 3 tons of bricks. In (3a) there is a causal relationship between Mary&apos;s pushing John and his falling, and the second event is understood to precede the first. In (3b), the second sentence is an elaboration of the first, and they therefore refer to aspects of the same event rather than to two sequential events. It has been suggested that only world knowledge allows one to detect that the default is being overridden here. For example, Lascarides &amp; Asher (1991) suggest that general knowledge postulates (in the case of (3a): that a pushing can cause a falling) can be invoked to generate the backward movement reading. The problem for practical systems is twofold: we could assume that in the case of narrative the Kamp/Hinrichs/Partee algorithm is the default, but each time the default is applied we would need to check all our available world knowledge to see whether there isn&apos;t a world knowledge postulate which might be overriding this assumption.

This algorithm gives the correct results in examples such as the following: 253 (1) John entered the room. Mary stood up. (2) John entered the room. Mary was seated behind the desk. In (1) the event of Mary&apos;s standing is understood to occur just after John enters the room, while in (2) the state in which Mary is seated is understood to overlap with the event of John&apos;s entering the room.

The method combines a constraint-based approach with an approach based on preferences: we exploit the HPSG type hierarchy and unification to arrive at a temporal structure using constraints placed on that structure by tense, aspect, rhetorical structure and temporal expressions, and we use the temporal centering preferences described by (Kameyama et al., 1993; Poesio, 1994) to rate the possibilities for temporal structure and choose the best among them. The starting point for this work was Scha and Polanyi&apos;s discourse grammar (Scha &amp; Polanyi 1988; Priist et a/ 1994). For the implementation we extended the HPSG grammar (Pollard and Sag, 1994) which Gerald Penn and Bob Carpenter first encoded in ALE (Carpenter, 1993).

This is a technique similar to the type of centering used for nominal anaphora (Sidner, 1983; Grosz et al., 1983). Centering assumes that discourse understanding requires some notion of &amp;quot;aboutness.&amp;quot; While nominal centering assumes there is one object that the current discourse is &amp;quot;about,&amp;quot; temporal centering assumes that there is one thread that the discourse is currently following, and that, in addition to tense and aspect constraints, there is a preference for a new utterance to continue a thread which has a parallel tense or which is semantically related to it and a preference to continue </context>

If more than one possibility exists, semantic preferences are used to choose between the possibilities. (a) A &amp;quot;semantic distance&amp;quot; rating between the new DCU and each previous thread is determined. (If there are no existing threads a new thread is started.) (b) Other preferences, such as a preference for relating the new DCU to a thread with parallel tense, are employed (See (Kameyama et al., 1993; Poesio, 1994) for details), and the resulting ratings are factored into the rating for each thread. (c) If the thread currently being followed is among the highest rated threads, this thread is continued. (This corresponds to temporal centering&apos;s preference to continue the current thread.) (d) If not, the DCU may continue any of the highest rated threads, and each of these solutions is generated. Charts such as Table 1 provide the observations we use to fill in the value of RHET_RELN.
