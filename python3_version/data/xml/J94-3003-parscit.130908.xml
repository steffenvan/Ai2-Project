To appreciate this article fully, it is essential to understand the historical context into
which it fits, and which it has to some extent created. Although formally published
for the first time here, it is already an extremely influential and classic piece of work.
Finite-state machines, in one form or another, have been used for the description
of natural language since the early 1950s, with the extension to transducers appearing
in the 1960s. After Chomsky&apos;s stern condemnation of the adequacy of finite-state ma-
chines for describing sentence structures, they virtually disappeared from mainstream
theoretical linguistics. Within computer science, they continued to be a standard for-
malism, although transducers were not accorded the same detailed algebraic attention
as simple automata.
Phonologists, meanwhile, were inventing a variety of rule mechanisms that were
(with rare exceptions) only partly formalized. Superficially, most of these systems (as
typified by those of Chomsky and Halle) appeared to have little to do with finite-state
machines. Indeed, their notations tended to suggest that the rules had much more
than finite-state power.
Kaplan and Kay have integrated these two streams of work—algebraic treatment
of automata in computer science, and phonologically-motivated formalisms within
linguistics—and their results should feed back productively into both subfields. The
framework they have established allows the comparison of different competing for-
malisms in a rigorous manner, and permits the exploration of the formal limitations or
capabilities of rule notations that were previously more like expository devices than
formally defined systems.
What may not be clear to the casual reader is that this work has been developed
over many years, and early versions of it have already escaped into the computational
linguistics community in less prominent forums. In this way it has already affected
the course of research into phonological/morphological formalisms. Perhaps the most
notable (and in its turn, influential) development has been Koskenniemi&apos;s two-level
morphology, which has been successfully applied to the morphology of a very wide
number of languages. Koskenniemi&apos;s ideas are a direct development of Kaplan and
Kay&apos;s, as explained in Section 7 of the paper here.
The theory of regular relations and finite-state transducers should not be viewed
as a mere re-formalisation of 1960s linguistics. As well as its relevance to the two-level
model, Kaplan and Kay suggest that it may also throw light on the formal properties
of autosegmental phonology. Although the ideas were first circulated about 15 years
ago, they are still of central relevance to computational phonology today.
