ties, and is also associated with the International Com-
mittee on Computational Linguistics.
Subscriptions to the AJCL are available only through
membership in the ACL. Each subscription includes
both hard-copy and microfiche versions of the Journal.
Annual membership dues are $15 for individuals and
$30 for institutions. Joint memberships for couples are
available for $20, but provide only one subscription.
Postage: The AJCL is normally mailed bulk-rate. First
class mailing is available in North America for an addi-
tional annual charge of $2. Air delivery is available
overseas for an additional annual charge of $4.
Back issues of the AJCL for the years 1974-1978 are
available on microfiche only. The rates per annual vol-
ume for the years 1974-1976 are $10 for individuals and
$25 for institutions. The rates per annual volume for the
years 1977-1978 are $15 for individuals and $30 for
institutions. First class or air delivery of back issues is
available for an additional charge of $2 or $4, as de-
scribed above. There were no issues in 1979.
Payments for dues or back issues should be sent to the
ACL Secretary-Treasurer at the address given above.
Checks should be made out to the Association for Com-
putational Linguistics (or to ACL) and should be payable
in U.S. dollars. There is an additional $1 charge for
bank processing costs for checks that are not drawn on
U.S. banks.
Address changes should be sent to the ACL

A Note from the Editor:
With this January-March, 1980, issue, the Association for Computational Linguistics
(ACL) begins publication of the new, phototypeset, printed version of the American
Journal of Computational Linguistics (AJCL). This is a continuation of the AJCL which
was published exclusively in a microfiche format under the editorship of David G. Hays
from 1974 through 1978. The decision to switch to a primarily hard-copy form, with a
microfiche supplement, was made by the ACL Executive Committee at the Annual
Meeting in July 1978, after a survey of the membership showed overwhelming support for
the idea. (The results of this survey are presented in an article on page 49.)
The first issue in this new form was originally scheduled for the first quarter of 1979,
but difficulties associated with the conversion caused several delays, eventually totaling a
whole year&apos;s time. By then it seemed like a good idea to give this first issue a date of
1980 and consider 1979 to be a year lost to experience. (As a consolation, members who
paid their dues in 1979 will not have to pay dues in 1980.)
Consequently, there will be no issues of the AJCL dated 1979, in either hard-copy or
microfiche form. In 1980 the AJCL is continuing where it left off in 1978: the 1978 issues
were Volume 5, so the 1980 issues are Volume 6; similarly, the last microfiche of 1978
was Mf. 83, so the one included with this issue is Mf. 84. (With this new form of
publication, each microfiche contains all of the material that is in the printed version, plus
some supplementary material.) On a related matter, the FINITE STRING Newsletter,
which has been published by the ACL since 1964, will continue to be a part of the AJCL,
but it will no longer have its own Volume and Number as it did in the microfiche format.
Any reference to material found there should simply be in terms of the AJCL issue in
which it appears.
The information about the AJCL Editorial Board and the ACL officers given on the
inside front cover of this issue is for 1979 rather than 1980. I felt that because these are
the people who were actually involved in the creation of this first issue, it would be more
appropriate to list them there this time than to list the current slate. An announcement
about the new officers appears on page 51.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank several people who played important
roles in bringing this venture to this point: Jon Allen, who, as ACL President in 1978,
lent his full support and encouragement to my proposal for converting the AJCL to a
phototypeset, printed journal; Ron Kaplan, who, as ACL President in 1979, provided
encouragement and exhibited great patience in &amp;quot;letting me do it my way&amp;quot;; Dave Hays,
who, as previous Editor of the AJCL, provided counsel and helped to smoothen the
transition; members of the Editorial Board, who provided prompt and thoughtful reviews
of manuscripts; authors of technical articles and book reviews, who were willing to submit
their material to an unproven publication; Lance Miller, my manager, and the IBM
Corporation, who provided me with encouragement, time, and excellent facilities; and last,
but certainly not least, Don Walker, the AJCL Managing Editor and ACL Secretary-
Treasurer, who has been in this with me from the start, helping with the survey, providing
advice on materials and formats for the Journal, gathering information on a variety of
topics, and, in general, competently handling the whole business side of the operation.
Also, I would like to take this opportunity to apologize to those people who have been
inconvenienced in any way by the delays associated with getting this first issue out,
especially authors who have been waiting to hear about the status of their papers. Now
that we have gotten over the hurdles of getting started, future issues should appear at
fairly regular three-month intervals, and correspondence should be handled more prompt-
ly. Submissions of technical articles and other material for inclusion in coming issues,
according to the guidelines given on the inside back cover, will continue to be welcome.
