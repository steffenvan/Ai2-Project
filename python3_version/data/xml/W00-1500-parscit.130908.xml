Using Toolsets and Architectures To Build NLP Systems
Centre Universitaire, Luxembourg
5 August 2000
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.999718523809524">
Many toolsets have been developed to support the implementation of single NLP components (taggers, parsers,
generators, dictionaries) or complete Natural Language Processing applications (Information Extraction systems,
Machine Translation systems). A source for available toolkits is the Natural Language Software Registry, an initiative
of the Association for Computational Linguistics hosted by DFKI at http://registry.dfki.de. These tools aim
at facilitating and lowering the cost of building NLP systems. Since the tools themselves are often complex pieces of
software, they require a significant amount of effort to be developed and maintained in the first place. Is this effort
worth the trouble? It is to be noted that NLP toolsets have often been originally developed for implementing a single
component or application. In this case, why not build the NLP system using a general programming language such as
Lisp or Prolog? There can be at least two answers. First, for pure efficiency issues (speed and space), it is often
preferable to build a parameterized algorithm operating on a uniform data structure (e.g., a phrase-structure parser).
Second, it is harder, and often impossible, to develop, debug and maintain a large NLP system directly written in a
general programming language.
It has been the experience of many users that a given toolset is quite often unusable outside its environment: the
toolset can be too restricted in its purpose (e.g. an MT toolset that cannot be used for building a grammar checker),
too complex to use, or even too difficult to install. There have been, in particular in the US under the Tipster program,
efforts to promote instead common architectures for a given set of applications (primarily IR and IE in Tipster; see
also the Galaxy architecture of the DARPA Communicator project). Several software environments have been built
around this flexible concept, which is closer to current trends in main stream software engineering.
The workshop aims at providing a picture of the current problems faced by developers and users of toolsets, and
future directions for the development and use of NLP toolsets. It includes reports of actual experiences in the use of
toolsets as well as presentation of toolsets and application development.
