We discuss the techniques we have developed and
implemented for the cross-categorial treatment of
comparatives in TEL!, a natural language question-
answering system that&apos;s transportable among both
application domains and types of backend retrieval
systems. For purposes of illustration, we shall
consider the example sentences &amp;quot;List the cars at least
20 inches more than twice as long as the Century is
wide&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Have any US companies made at least 3
more large cars than Buick?&amp;quot; Issues to be considered
include comparative inflections, left recursion and
other forms of nesting, extraposition of comparative

1. Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9957676875">
We shall describe a general treatment of
comparatives that has been implemented in the
context of TEL!, a question-answering system which
is transportable among both domains of discourse and
different types of backend retrieval systems.&apos;
Comparatives are important because of the dramatic
increase in expressive power they allow; they are
interesting at least because of the variety of issues
(from morphology on up) one must deal with in
order to provide for them.
1. The examples in this paper illustrate TELI as a front-end to
the ICandor knowledge representation system (Patel-Schneider,
1984); we will give examples in terms of a knowledge base of
information about 1987 cars. TELI has produced queries for
at least four different &amp;quot;backend&amp;quot; systems and has been adapted
for over a dozen domains of data.

1.1 Goals
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999907470588235">
In seeking to provide TELI with general capabilities
for comparatives, our primary goals have been
to formulate cross-categorial techniques that treat
the comparativizations of different syntactic elements
(e.g. adjectives, quantifiers, and measure nouns) with
the same mechanisms;
to allow comparatives to be composed with
themselves (e.g. &amp;quot;at least 3 more than 3 times as
many&amp;quot;) and with other syntactic features (e.g. wh
elements);
to be faithful to what is known from work in
theoretical linguistics; we draw from Bresnan (1973),
Cushing (1982), Dik (1980), Jackendoff (1977),
Sells (1985), and Winograd (1983);
to account for as many of the specific cases of
comparatives found in the literature of implemented
NL processors as possible.

Letting &lt;X&gt; denote a grammatical category to be
comparativized, we begin by providing for
comparativized structures Cf &lt;X&gt;) of the form

where (...) denotes optionality; &amp;quot;/&amp;quot; indicates
&amp;quot;agreement&amp;quot; between comparative particles; and
&lt;Etcx&gt; accounts for items parallel to those in the
matrix clause in which the comparative occurs (e.g.
&amp;quot;cars that are longer than the Regal (is (wide))&amp;quot;). In
addition, a variety of extrapositions (i.e. rightward
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.998985">
41
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.99234384375">
and occasional leftward movement) from C(&lt;X&gt;)
may (and sometimes must) occur. For example, both
&amp;quot;cars larger than the Century&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;larger cars than
the Century&amp;quot; are allowed.
Since we wish to allow CI&lt;X&gt;) structures
to occur wherever &lt;X&gt; could occur, arbitrarily
complex interactions with quantifiers (within the
complement), ordinals, superlatives, raisings, wh
elements, and other constructs must be provided for.
In addition to the structures indicated by the BNF
above, we allow for some simpler expressions not
conventionally classified as comparatives. Some
examples are &amp;quot;6 cars&amp;quot; (cf. &amp;quot;as many as 6 cars&amp;quot;) and
&amp;quot;3 inches long&amp;quot; (cf. &amp;quot;as long as 3 inches&amp;quot;). We also
provide for structures involving the nominal
counterpart of an adjective, as in &amp;quot;more than 185
inches in length&amp;quot;.
To date, we have fully implemented a wide
variety of comparatives related to adjectives,
quantifiers, and measure nouns (e.g. &amp;quot;cars that cost
at least $100 more than the Park Avenue&amp;quot;). Due to
the commonality among the comparativized syntactic
structures, our grammar for these three types of
comparatives is produced by meta-rules suggested by
the BNF rules shown above. Although the feature
agreement provided by our parser is used to eliminate
spurious structures such as &amp;quot;cars more than 3
(inches/.dollars) long&amp;quot;, we avoid conflicts between
pure numbers and measure phrases that involve a
unit (e.g. &amp;quot;companies that make more than 3
(*dollars) cars&amp;quot;) by having two (very nearly
identical) Quantity routines in the grammar.

1.3 Limitations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999805384615384">
In addition to some specific limitations to be stated in
the remainder of the paper, there are some general
limitations of our work to date, many of which are
being rectified by the work mentioned in Section 8.3.
(1) By analogy with conjunctions, with which
comparatives share a number of properties (cf. Sager
1981, pp. 196IT), our comparative particle pairs (-
er/than etc.) provide for co-ordinate comparatives, in
contrast to pairs such as so/that, as in &amp;quot;Buick makes
so many cars that it&apos;s the largest company.&amp;quot; (2)
Comparative complements are expected in a limited
number of places. For example, &amp;quot;Audi makes more
large cars than Pontiac in France&amp;quot; is recognized but
&amp;quot;Audi makes more large cars in France than Pontiac&amp;quot;
is not. This is because we currently propagate the
evidence of having found a comparative particle
(&amp;quot;more&amp;quot;) to the noun phrase headed by &amp;quot;cars&amp;quot;, hence
the complement (&amp;quot;than ...&amp;quot;) can attach there, but not
to the higher level verb phrase headed by &amp;quot;makes&amp;quot;.
This limitation also prevents our processing &amp;quot;What
companies make a larger car than Buick&amp;quot;, whose
exact meaning(s) the reader is invited to ponder. (3)
Since comparative complements are based on noun
phrases, neither &amp;quot;Audi makes more large cars in
France than in Germany&amp;quot; nor &amp;quot;Audi makes large
cars more in France than in Germany&amp;quot; is recognized.
(4) We attempt no pragmatic disambiguation of
semantically ambiguous comparatives. Thus, when
confronted with &amp;quot;more than 3 inches shorter&amp;quot; or
&amp;quot;more than 3 fewer cars&amp;quot;, we provide the
compositional interpretation associated with our left
recursive syntax. Even expressions such as &amp;quot;as many&amp;quot;
and &amp;quot;as large&amp;quot; are ambiguous between at least and
exactly. (5) We attempt no anaphora processing,
and so comparatives without a complement, as in
&amp;quot;Which cars are larger?&amp;quot;, are not processed. (6) We
provide general conversion of units of measure (e.g.
&amp;quot;2 feet longer&amp;quot; is the same as &amp;quot;24 inches longer&amp;quot;) but
they are not fully incorporated into the system.

2. An Initial Example
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999917">
The mechanisms we shall describe apply a
conventional series of transformations to sentences
containing one or more comparatives, ultimately
resulting in an executable expression. As an example
of this process,2 we&apos;ll consider the input
&amp;quot;List the cars at letst 20 inches more than twice
as long as the Century is wide&amp;quot;
which contains a highly comparativized adjective.
First, this input is scanned and parsed, yielding the
parse tree shown in Figure 1. Note that each
CO1VIPAR node has a QUANTITY node and a
MODE3 of its own. Also, the MODE of the top
COMPAR (whose value is &amp;quot;equal&amp;quot;) is co-indexed
(indicated by the subsrcipt 0 with the MODE
feature associate with the particle (&amp;quot;as&amp;quot;) that
intervenes between the ADJ and its COMPAR-
ARG; this assures that -er/than, less/than, and as/as
pairs collocate correctly. Next, we build a
&amp;quot;normalized&amp;quot; parse tree by reconstructing elements
that were discontinuous in the surface structure and

corresponds to &amp;quot;at least 20 inches more than twice as

3. Lexical Provisions for Comparatives
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999843166666667">
Our current repertoire of domain-independent lexical
items associated with comparatives includes &amp;quot;many&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;few&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;much&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;more&amp;quot;, with 3 readings (er,
er+many, er+much), following Bresnan (1972) and
similar to Robinson (1982, p. 28); &amp;quot;fewer (er+few);
less&amp;quot;, with 3 readings (less, er+few6, less+much);
several formatives and adverbials (&amp;quot;at&amp;quot;, least&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;most&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;exactly&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;precisely&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;only&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;just&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;hair,
&amp;quot;again&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;times&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;percent&amp;quot;); and a handful of spelled.
out ordinals (&amp;quot;thirds&amp;quot; etc.). Though not stored in the
lexicon, both integers and floating-point numbers (cf.
&amp;quot;3.45 inches&amp;quot;) are also involved in comparativization.
The domain-dependent portion of the lexicon
includes members of the open categories of
adjectives, measure nouns, and comparative
inflections of adjectives. The scanner output for the
comparative of the adjective A is er+A (e.g. &amp;quot;larger&amp;quot;
becomes er+large).
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.974516" genericHeader="method">
4. Syntax for Comparatives
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999695">
The basic syntax for comparatives adheres to the
meta-rules given in Section 1.2. As indicated in the
parse tree of Figure 1, COMPAR is never a primary
tree node but is instead a daughter of the node being
comparativized. Furthermore, since our grammar
has recently taken on somewhat of an X-bar flavor
(cf. Jackendoff, 1977), the complement for a
comparativized item is found as either its sister or its
parent&apos;s sister. Complex comparatives derive from
left-recursive structures.7 Our present grammar for
comparatives is set up partly by meta-rules8 and
partly by hand-coded rules relating to such
idiosyncracies as &amp;quot;more than 3 inches in length&amp;quot;
(however, cf. &amp;quot;more than 6 in number&amp;quot;).
</bodyText>
<tableCaption confidence="0.5852548">
6. To the possible horror of the prescriptive grammarian, this
accounts for such attrocities as &apos;less books&amp;quot;.
7. Though our parser operates top-down, we&apos;ve incorporated a
general mechanism for left recursion that&apos;s also utilized by
possessives (e.g. &amp;quot;the newest car&apos;s company&apos;s largest
competitor&apos;s smallest car&amp;quot;).
8. Meta-rules are also used to produce the grammar for relative
clauses, yes-no questions, and a host of other structures (e.g.
various slash categories) from a hand-coded grammar for basic
declarative sentences.

S. Parse Tree Normalization •
Letting Nodei&lt; X&gt;) denote a node of the
normalized parse tree associated with an element of
type &lt;X&gt;, comparatives involve the replacement
denoted by
Node(CRX&gt;))

where &lt;Arg&gt; corresponds to an optional noun
phrase, &lt;Etcx&gt; captures non-elided material
associated with the matrix clause, and the 2-place-
relation denoted by &lt;Rel&gt; is the most interesting
(and by far the most complex) element produced.
The algorithm that produces it converts &amp;quot;more&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;less&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;times&amp;quot; respectively into +, —, and. This
process is left recursive; the relational operator is
determined from the highest MODE, and by default
it is assigned to be •■.9 As indicated below, these
algebraic and arithmetic symbols will be preserved in
the executable expression unless the word being
comparativized indicates a downward direction on the
scale applicable to it (e.g. &amp;quot;fewer&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;shorter&amp;quot;), in
which case they will be reversed (e.g. becomes
and + becomes Each 2-place-relation is the body
of a 2-place lambda whose variables, P and A, are
associated with values obtained from a parameter
and an argument against which a comparison is
being made. Some example 2-place-predicates are
more than 166 inches long (&gt;P 166)
more than 15 feet long (&gt;P 180)
at most 180 inches lag (&lt; P 180)
longer than (&gt; P A)
at least as long as (= P A)
1 inch longer than (&gt; P (4k.1 A))
exactly twice as long as (•• P (• 2 A))
3 times as long as (&gt; P (.3 A))
half again as long as () p(. 1.5 A))
forty percent longer than (&gt; P (• (+ (/ 40 100) 1) A))
less than one third as long as (&lt; P (• (/ 1 3) A))
at least 3 inches more than
twice as long as (&gt; P (+ 3 (.2 A)))
When the measure noun appearing in an English
input differs from that by which the objects being
tested are measured, as indicated by the second
example above, a scalar conversion is required.
9. This addresses the inherent ambiguity of as/as structures
without an adverbial element, such as &amp;quot;exactly&amp;quot; or &apos;at least&amp;quot;.
Thus, &amp;quot;people with 3 children&apos; is interpreted as people with
exactly 3 children.

6. Semantics for Comparatives
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997521285714286">
The semantics of comparativization involves
converting a one-place predicate into another one-
place predicate by performing arbitrarily complex
operations on it. For example, if &amp;quot;large car&amp;quot; has been
defined as a car whose length exceeds 190 inches,
then, letting &amp;quot;A&amp;quot; denote a noun phrase complement,
some examples are
</bodyText>
<table confidence="0.8419635">
long Leagth(x) 190
longer than 180 inches Length(x) &gt; 180

twice as long as A is wide Length(x) 2 • Width(A)
3 inches more than
</tableCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.9855558">
twice as Meg as A Length(x) &gt; 3 + 2 • Lengtb(A)
where each of these right-hand-sides is the body of a
one-place predicate whose single variable is x.
As a second example, comparative quantifiers
such as &amp;quot;more than 6&amp;quot; are handled by an identical
processi°, as indicated by&amp;quot;
x has many y&apos;s Size ly I Has(x,y)) Constant
x has more than 6 y&apos;s Size 1y I Has(x,y)) &gt;6
x has more y&apos;s than A Size LI, I Has(x,y)) &gt; Size billas(A,y))
x has at least 2 more Size (y I Has(x,y))
y&apos;s than A 2 + Size (ylifitsG4,01
where the initial Constant denotes some arbitrary
constant.
In general, comparativizing a one-place
predicate takes place as follows.

of a comparative quantifier may contain an arbitrarily complex
predicate.

7. Comparatives Containing a Wh Element
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995634054054054">
In addition to recognizing wh elements associated
with a relative or interrogative clause,12 TELI
recognizes the word how when it appears in place of
a quantity, e.g. &amp;quot;how long&amp;quot; (cf. &amp;quot;6 inches long&amp;quot;) and
&amp;quot;how many more&amp;quot; (cf. &amp;quot;6 more&amp;quot;13). Wherever wh
appears, however, we treat its semantics as roughly
&amp;quot;solve for wh such that&amp;quot;. In the case of interrogative
pronouns (e.g. &amp;quot;what&amp;quot;), this leads rather obviously to
an internal representation asking for a SET. In the
case of &amp;quot;how&amp;quot;, this treatment is also in order since it
represents a (quantity) NP. For simplicity, we
produce an expression containing an unbound wh and
later give it wide scope.14 In particular, subsequent
processing involves moving the wh element upward in
the logical form tree ls by performing appropriate
transformations.
12. To see that wh is less than a &amp;quot;word&amp;quot;, consider pairs such as
what/that, where/there and when/then. The advantage of
recognizing sub-word units as the primitives on which syntax
and/or semantic analysis is based should come as no surprise to
anyone acquainted with the structure of languages other than
English, which is unusual in coming so close to being treatable
solely at the word level.
13. As stated earlier, we have adopted derivations suggested by
Bresnan (1973) such as -erl-many--•more. In the case at
hand, we must assume something like Qi-many--K), where Q
denotes a quantity.
14. The scope is wide but not global because of inputs such as
&amp;quot;How many cars does each US company make?&amp;quot;
15. Of course, our algebraic-logical forms, based on operators and
their associated arguments, amount to being trees.
For illustration, consider the absurdly
complicated example
&amp;quot;Buick makes 3 more than bow many percent
more cars than Audi?&amp;quot;
the comparative portion of whose internal
representation16 is
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.383491">
(X (P A) P C. 0, A (+ 1 (/ WE 100))) 3]
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.998338666666667">
At this point, we proceed with semantic processing,
ignoring for the moment the presence of the unbound
WH element. In the case at hand, this leads to
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.932231285714286">
C. (COUNT (SET (CAR P1) (Make BUICK P1)))
(+ (&apos; (COUNT (SET (CAR P1)

Thus far, we have presented an overview of our
treatment of comparatives, with as much detail as
we&apos;re able to supply in a conference-length paper.
Although we can offer no substantive empirical
evidence with TELI (e.g. results of use by non-
authors), we believe some of the techniques we&apos;ve
presented can be put to use by the reader. Further
information, especially with regard to the interaction
of comparatives with a variety of other types of
constructs, can be found in Ballard and Stumberger
(1987).
16. The sentence is ambiguous, with readings indicated by &amp;quot;3 more
than [how many percent1&amp;quot; and 13 more than how manyi
percent&amp;quot;. As indicated earlier, we presently take the reading
that favors the use of left recursion.
17. Problematic situations can arise in which simple algebraic
operations aren&apos;t sufficienct. For example, in examples such as
&amp;quot;Cars were sold to people with how many children?&amp;quot;, we must
move wh past a logical quantifier, rather than the arithmetic
operators as shown above.

8.1 Related Work parse tree&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;algebraic-logical form&amp;quot; correspond
Although the literature describing implemented NL rather loosely to what in the literature are often
processors contains many examples of comparative called &amp;quot;logical form&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;meaning representation&amp;quot;,
constructions (cf. Kirsch (1964) for a wealth of early respectively. Furthermore, in the most recent work
examples), at least two qualifications may be given with TEL!, meaningful distinctions between modules
concerning the current &amp;quot;state of the art&amp;quot; of have become blurred, although the relative order in
comparative treatment. First, the majority of the which operations are carried out is largely the same.

for by specifying a 2-place predicate in advance proposed, we have found terms such as &amp;quot;logical form&amp;quot;
that&apos;s effectively equivalent to the 2-place predicate being used in the literature in quite vague and often
we construct from an underlying 1-place predicate by incompatible ways. Furthermore, we know of no
way of coercion into a 1-place function. This allows compelling arguments that suggest that a

8.2 Levels of Representation 8.3 Current Work
The architecture of TELI resembles that of similarly The representation given in Section 5 fundamentally
motivated question answering systems (cf. Grosz et restricts us from handling comparatives whose
al, 1987; Hafner and Godden, 1985; Bates and complement is more than one level above the word
Bobrow, 1983 and Bates et al 1985) by comprising a being comparativized (e.g. &amp;quot;John persuaded his
linear sequence of processing stages which produce students to contribute to more museums than Bill
successively &amp;quot;lower&amp;quot; level representations of the did&amp;quot;). Our current work involves producing
input.&amp;quot; Although our parse tree format is rather normalized parse tree structures of roughly the form
conventiona1,21 what we have called &amp;quot;normalized (COMPAR-2 C1 &lt;Comp&gt;
(COMPAR-1 C, —)
where the COMPAR-1 and &lt;Comp&gt; structures
correspond to the COMPAR structure given in
Section 5; CI provides for co-indexing when multiple
comparativizations are present; and the first &amp;quot;...&amp;quot;
allows for arbitrarily many levels. This calls upon us
to modify the semantic processing presented in
Section 6, making it resemble the treatment given to
wh elements as described in Section 7.
9. Conclusions
We have presented algorithms aimed at the
morphological, syntactic, and semantic problems
associated with a large variety of comparative
structures that arise in the context of question
answering. We believe the extent of our coverage
equals in several ways and exceeds in some ways the
capabilities known to us via the literature. However,
18. Evidence of the gap between what&apos;s been studied and what 46
may actually be important is expressed, in the context of
pronoun resolution, in Hobbs (1978, p. 343) as follows: &amp;quot;There
are classes of examples from the literature which are not ...
handled by the algorithm, but they occur rarely in actual texts,
and in view of the fact that the algorithm fails on much more
natural and common examples, there seems to be little point in
greatly complicating the algorithm to handle them.&apos;
19. The extent to which *shortcuts* are justified, from either a
psychological or system designer&apos;s standpoint, is not clear. As
a possibly bizarre example, consider the word *after&amp;quot;, which
could be treated as *-er *aft than&apos;, where *aft is the Anglo-
Saxon root (extant only on board ship) from which current
English word derives. A perhaps even more bizarre
opportunity may exist for treating &apos;rather* as &apos;&apos;-er •rathe*,
where usrathe&amp;quot; is a Middle English adverb meaning *quickly&amp;quot;.
20. We&apos;re using low* to refer to level of abstraction. Perhaps
ironically, successively higher levels of cognitive information
are involved in producing these &amp;quot;lower* level representation.
21. The methods whereby TELI produces parse trees are less
conventional than the trees it produces, due to our provision for
having the parser enforce agreements automatically while it is
running, rather than doing subsequent filtering.
comparatives operate as a &amp;quot;meta&amp;quot; phenomenon and
thus cut across many issues; we have ignored certain
problems and knowingly treated others inadequately.
Further work is certainly required, and we hope to
have presented a framework in which (1) some
interesting and important capabilities can be provided
for now and (2) further computational studies can be
carried out.

To see that wh is less than a &amp;quot;word&amp;quot;, consider pairs such as what/that, where/there and when/then. The advantage of recognizing sub-word units as the primitives on which syntax and/or semantic analysis is based should come as no surprise to anyone acquainted with the structure of languages other than English, which is unusual in coming so close to being treatable solely at the word level. 13. As stated earlier, we have adopted derivations suggested by Bresnan (1973) such as -erl-many--•more. In the case at hand, we must assume something like Qi-many--K), where Q denotes a quantity. 14. The scope is wide but not global because of inputs such as &amp;quot;How many cars does each US company make?&amp;quot; 15. Of course, our algebraic-logical forms, based on operators and their associated arguments, amount to being trees. For illustration, consider the absurdly complicated example &amp;quot;Buick makes 3 more than bow many percent more cars than Audi?&amp;quot; the comparative portion of whose internal representation16 is (X (P A) P C. 0, A (+ 1 (/ WE 100))) 3] At this point, we proceed with </context>

The scanner output for the comparative of the adjective A is er+A (e.g. &amp;quot;larger&amp;quot; becomes er+large). 4. Syntax for Comparatives The basic syntax for comparatives adheres to the meta-rules given in Section 1.2. As indicated in the parse tree of Figure 1, COMPAR is never a primary tree node but is instead a daughter of the node being comparativized. Furthermore, since our grammar has recently taken on somewhat of an X-bar flavor (cf. Jackendoff, 1977), the complement for a comparativized item is found as either its sister or its parent&apos;s sister. Complex comparatives derive from left-recursive structures.7 Our present grammar for comparatives is set up partly by meta-rules8 and partly by hand-coded rules relating to such idiosyncracies as &amp;quot;more than 3 inches in length&amp;quot; (however, cf. &amp;quot;more than 6 in number&amp;quot;). 6. To the possible horror of the prescriptive grammarian, this accounts for such attrocities as &apos;less books&amp;quot;. 7. Though our parser operates top-down, we&apos;ve incorporated a general mechanism for left recursion that&apos;s also utilized by poss</context>

Introduction We shall describe a general treatment of comparatives that has been implemented in the context of TEL!, a question-answering system which is transportable among both domains of discourse and different types of backend retrieval systems.&apos; Comparatives are important because of the dramatic increase in expressive power they allow; they are interesting at least because of the variety of issues (from morphology on up) one must deal with in order to provide for them. 1. The examples in this paper illustrate TELI as a front-end to the ICandor knowledge representation system (Patel-Schneider, 1984); we will give examples in terms of a knowledge base of information about 1987 cars. TELI has produced queries for at least four different &amp;quot;backend&amp;quot; systems and has been adapted for over a dozen domains of data. 1.1 Goals In seeking to provide TELI with general capabilities for comparatives, our primary goals have been to formulate cross-categorial techniques that treat the comparativizations of different syntactic elements (e.g. adjectives, quantifiers, and measure nouns) with the same mechanisms; to allow comparatives to be composed with themselves (e.g. &amp;quot;at least 3 more than 3 times as many</context>

Lexical Provisions for Comparatives Our current repertoire of domain-independent lexical items associated with comparatives includes &amp;quot;many&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;few&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;much&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;more&amp;quot;, with 3 readings (er, er+many, er+much), following Bresnan (1972) and similar to Robinson (1982, p. 28); &amp;quot;fewer (er+few); less&amp;quot;, with 3 readings (less, er+few6, less+much); several formatives and adverbials (&amp;quot;at&amp;quot;, least&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;most&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;exactly&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;precisely&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;only&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;just&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;hair, &amp;quot;again&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;times&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;percent&amp;quot;); and a handful of spelled. out ordinals (&amp;quot;thirds&amp;quot; etc.).

(1) By analogy with conjunctions, with which comparatives share a number of properties (cf. Sager 1981, pp. 196IT), our comparative particle pairs (- er/than etc.) provide for co-ordinate comparatives, in contrast to pairs such as so/that, as in &amp;quot;Buick makes so many cars that it&apos;s the largest company.&amp;quot; (2) Comparative complements are expected in a limited number of places. For example, &amp;quot;Audi makes more large cars than Pontiac in France&amp;quot; is recognized but &amp;quot;Audi makes more large cars in France than Pontiac&amp;quot; is not. This is because we currently propagate the evidence of having found a comparative particle (&amp;quot;more&amp;quot;) to the noun phrase headed by &amp;quot;cars&amp;quot;, hence the complement (&amp;quot;than ...&amp;quot;) can attach t</context>
