This is the first and final collection of a noteworthy set of research papers, which is
both historical and timely. PLNLP, the Programming Language for Natural Language
Processing, which emerged at IBM&apos;s Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown
Heights about 15 years ago, is ostensibly the glue that holds the volume&apos;s 22 chapters
together. But it is as much the corporate umbrella of IBM and its massive, international
presence that makes the book a whole, and to a large extent the evolution of the
research described here parallels the changes in the parent company. Just as there
will never be another monolithic mainframe monopoly, there may never be another
corporate environment in which so many researchers can cultivate their ideas for so
long with relatively little disruption or focus on profit.
While many of the papers are excellent in their own right, this historical perspec-
tive makes them more interesting, and certainly justifies taking another look at some
of them. Almost all of the book has appeared in print elsewhere at one time or another
(starting in 1982), although some in sources that are not widely available. The book
includes revised or shortened versions of some of the papers, along with a lucid and
well-written introduction, and one new unpublished paper (Chapter 2).
PLNLP (often pronounced &amp;quot;Penelope&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Plenelope,&amp;quot; the editors point out) is the
basis for some sizable applied natural language projects, the best known of which is
the Critique text-processing system, a grammar and style checker that IBM took into
development. Within PLNLP, the IBM group developed an extensive English grammar
called PEG (PLNLP English Grammar) and a text-critiquing system called EPISTLE,
which later became Critique. By the time Critique (along with the book&apos;s editors)
moved from Yorktown to an IBM development lab in Bethesda, a variety of simpler,
relatively inexpensive text-critiquing competitors had come to market through small
companies. The editors now work for the Research Division of Microsoft.
The book is balanced with respect to theory and practice, and covers a variety of
topics, including syntax and its application to text-critiquing, using on-line dictionar-
ies, machine translation, semantics, and sense disambiguation. The new research con-
tribution, &amp;quot;Towards Transductive Linguistics&amp;quot; (Chapter 2) by Alexis Manaster Ramer,
gives a theoretical perspective. While it is interesting and readable, it is a bit awkward,
appearing to retrofit various theories, including Chomsky&apos;s, to the IBM work and con-
trasting the transductive model embodied in Critique with the traditional generative
model of syntax. Presumably this analysis is meant to help tie the rest of the papers
together. After all, in grammar checking or machine translation, a system must do

more than simply decide whether a sentence is grammatically correct: it must pro-
duce analyses that help to correct the input or to provide an accurate translation. This
could easily have been explained without a tutorial on transducers, complete with
Turing-machine state table.
The papers on PEG and Critique, about a third of the book, provide interest-
ing re-reading. These are followed by several papers on parsing and disambiguating
dictionary definitions and using on-line dictionaries. The IBM groups pioneered the
use of on-line resources in NLP, represented by papers by Klavans, Chodorow, and
Wacholder; Binot and Jensen; and Ravin. Two newer papers, by Montemagni and
Vanderwende and by Vanderwende alone, show that the work has continued; the
Vanderwende article on noun sequences is extracted from a forthcoming Ph.D. thesis.
The machine translation work appears in several different places in the book,
apparently representing the editors&apos; attempt to organize the work into traditional cat-
egories like syntax and logical form. This is one place where things get confusing.
Several MT systems are described, covering languages from Chinese to Norwegian.
While the paper by Diana Santos gives some perspective on the use of PEG in MT
and the motivation for transfer-based approaches, MT is too complicated and idiosyn-
cratic to make the relationships between the systems apparent. A bit more editorial
commentary might have helped here.
Two papers on sense discrimination, one by Braden-Harder and one by Tsutsumi,
are an excellent foil for the syntactically oriented research. Neither has been published
in any well-circulated form. Braden-Harder&apos;s paper, &amp;quot;Sense Disambiguation Using
Online Dictionaries,&amp;quot; is a synopsis of her 1991 thesis that reads well and gives valuable
insights into the problem of sense interpretation and the role of dictionaries. This
paper also stands out (along with Braden-Harder&apos;s other contribution with Stephen
Richardson on Critique) as one that actually tries to evaluate the accuracy of the
system. In a book full of large but often incomplete systems, the reporting of results,
even sketchy ones, is refreshing.
The book wraps up with two additional papers on semantics. The final chapter,
&amp;quot;The Paragraph as a Semantic Unit&amp;quot; by Zadrozny and Jensen, appeared in Computa-
tional Linguistics in a longer form (called &amp;quot;Semantics of Paragraphs&amp;quot;) in 1991. While
it&apos;s more ethereal and somewhat detached from the other papers, spanning linguistics
and philosophy, and presenting examples that have never really been automatically
analyzed, it provides nice food for thought about the future of research in the field.
Just as the preoccupation with syntax embodied in the early years of PLNLP may be
a thing of the past, the emphasis on sentences as the principal unit of communication
is losing out to larger and longer structures.
In summary, this is an interesting collection that is likely to stay fresh for some
time. The PLNLP era, like the mainframe era, may be ending, but the lessons of the
research should stay with us for some time. Although the collection may not age like
a fine wine, it is good reading and will be worth consulting periodically.
