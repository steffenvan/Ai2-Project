Statistical methods in NLP have exploited a variety of classification techniques as core building blocks for
complex models and pipelines. In this tutorial, we will survey the basic techniques behind classification. We
first consider the basic principles, including the principles of maximum likelihood and maximum margin.
We then discuss several core classification technologies: naive Bayes, perceptrons, logistic regression, and
support vector machines. The discussion will include the key optimization ideas behind their training and
the empirical trade-offs between the various classifiers. Finally, we consider the extension to kernels and
kernelized classification: what can kernels offer and what is their cost? The presentation is targeted to NLP
researchers new to these methods or those wanting to understand more about how these techniques are
interconnected.
