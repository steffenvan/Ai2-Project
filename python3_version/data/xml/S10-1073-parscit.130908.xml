This paper describes the participation of

the TempEval-2 evaluation. The UC3M
system was originally developed for the
temporal expressions recognition and
normalization (TERN task) in Spanish texts,

approach based on the empirical study of
frequency of temporal expressions in Spanish

The study of temporality in NLP is not a new
task. However, in the last years it has witnessed a
huge interest. Initiatives like TempEval task or

hand it is possible to measure the systems’
performance under standardized metrics, sharing
datasets and other resources. On the other hand,
it is possible to make comparative evaluations
among distinct participants looking forward the
same objectives but using different approaches.
Until recently, most of temporally annotated
corpora, as well as temporal taggers, were
available in English. Since languages as Spanish
start to become prominent in the field it seems
interesting the development of specific resources.
Tempeval-2 has contributed to this target in a
significant way thanks to the release of annotated
corpora and the publication of specific guidelines
(Sauri et al., 2009), (Saurí et al., 2010).
This paper resumes the participation of the
UC3M system in the task of determining the
extent and resolving the value of time
expressions in texts (Task A). This system was
originally developed for the Spanish TERN task
proposed in ACE 2007 evaluation (Vicente-Díez
et al., 2007), achieving encouraging results
although it was in a early stage of development.
The system follows a ruled-based approach
whose knowledge base has been inducted from
the study of annotated temporal corpora
(Vicente-Díez et al., 2008). A machine learning
approach was initially discarded due to the
limitation of annotated Spanish corpora.
The aims of this work were to improve the
coverage of the original system and test its
performance against new available datasets with
a view to its integration in future domains of
application. Main challenges were to move to a
new temporal model where interval is considered
as the basic time unit as well as the isolation of
the internal representation of temporal
information from the annotation schema.

2 System Description
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999968631578947">
The UC3M system recognizes and annotates
temporal expressions in texts based on a
linguistic rules engine for Spanish language.
Our system is divided into three different
parts: recognition of temporal expressions,
normalization of the detections, and annotation
of the temporal expressions according to the
TimeML schema.
Following the definition of the Task A, the
system is able to determine not only the extent of
the temporal expressions but also the value of the
features TYPE and VAL. It differentiates among
the four TYPE values (dates, durations, sets and
times) thanks to the classification of the
recognition rules. The system straightforwardly
provides a VAL attribute that accomplishes the
format defined by TIMEX2 and TIMEX3
standards through its internal model for
representing time.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.985521">
2.1 Recognition
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999963851851852">
The recognizer detects temporal expressions by
means of a set of linguistic rules, focusing on
those which are most frequent in Spanish.
We adopted an empirical inductive approach
through the analysis of the different types of
temporal expressions in news corpora, and we
could outline a typology of most common time
expressions in the language. The typology
together with the patterns that define these
expressions form up the knowledge base for a
successful automatic identification and resolution
of temporal expressions.
The rule engine allows managing different sets
of rules independently of the target. In this case,
the rules have been created attending to each
pattern that is likely to match a temporal
expression. Each rule determines the set of
tokens that form an expression, the normalization
type to be applied and the expression type.
In Table 1 an example of a rule to identify
dates is shown. The first line represents the name
of the rule. The second line specifies the
normalization method that will be used once the
expression is recognized. The third line specifies
the type of the temporal expression and the
annotation pattern. Finally, the fourth line shows
the tokens that trigger the rule.

The operation of the system is described as
follows: first, the text is parsed token by token.
Then, for each token, every rule is checked to
find out if it triggers through a given token and
the following ones.
This operation implies that the higher the
number of rules, the slower the text processing.
The disadvantage of the processing speed has
been accepted as a design criterion for the sake
of the simplicity of creating new rules.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.965186">
2.2 Normalization
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999963558823529">
The temporal expression normalization is done
as an intermediate step between recognition and
annotation, isolating the extraction of semantics
from the annotation schema while trying to
facilitate the second step.
Normalization is important since recognized
time expressions are managed and returned in a
standard format that avoids semantic
ambiguities.
UC3M system applies an interval-based
temporal normalization. It means that every
temporal expression is represented as an interval
with two boundaries: an initial and a final date
(including time). This approach is motivated by
the belief that the use of intervals as a basic time
unit leads to a lower loss of semantics. For
instance, when an expression like “en enero” (“in
January”) is detected, current task proposes the
annotation “2010-01”. However, we think that
for many applications that are likely to use this
system it would be more useful to have the
complete interval that the expression refers
(“2010-01-01 - 2010-01-31”). Through a set of
procedures (as getting the length of a given
month), our system tries to define the interval
boundaries as much as possible. Every
normalized expression is made up of two dates
although it refers to a concrete date or time.
In the internal representation model
normalized dates and times adopts the ISO-8601
form, durations are captured as a length related
to the unit of measure, and sets are managed in a
similar way to durations, adding quantity and
frequency modifiers.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.988377">

<bodyText confidence="0.935062166666667">
The normalization process is dependent on the
rule used to recognize each expression. For each
new rule added to the engine a new
normalization clause is needed.
In Table 2 some temporal expression
normalization examples are presented:

The annotation process starts from the
normalized form of the temporal expression. The
system implements a transformation procedure
based on patterns. This transformation is
dependent on the temporal expression type.
Dates: when dealing with dates, the VAL
value is extracted from the initial boundary of the
interval in accordance with the annotation pattern
defined in the corresponding rule (see Table 1).
Some examples are shown in Table 3.

Precision and recall and f-measure are used as
evaluation metrics according to the evaluation
methodology (Pustejovsky et al., 2009). To
determine the quality of annotation, results are
completed with figures concerning to the
resolution of TYPE and VAL attributes.
Before evaluation, the system was tested on
the training corpus and, once the test datasets
were released, it was tested on the corpus for
relations detection (tasks C-F) since it contained
both files &amp;quot;timex-extents.tab&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;timex-

Analyzing the experimental errors several
facts can be highlighted:
The percentage of expressions completely and
correctly recognized and normalized is good but
there are some missing expressions, mainly due
to their complexity (or fuzziness) and to the
absence of a rule to manage them, i.e.: “durante
un largo periodo” (during a long period).
Errors in determining the extent of the
temporal expressions were mainly due to the
inclusion of prepositions or articles that precede
to the kernel of the expression, i.e.: “a corto
plazo” vs. “corto plazo” (in short term).
A number of false positives were due to some
inconsistencies in the annotation of the corpus.
An example has been observed in fuzzy time
expressions that denotes a future reference: “el
próximo técnico” (the next trainer) (not
annotated) vs. “el próximo preparador” (the next
coach) (FUTURE_REF)
Although normalization figures are good,
some annotations are incorrect if their resolution
implies context-aware mechanisms.

4 Conclusions and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999967666666667">
In this paper a rule based approach for
automatically detecting and annotating temporal
expressions according to TimeML TIMEX3 tag
has been presented. It is based on an empirical
study of temporal expressions frequencies in
Spanish that provides the main recognition rules
of the knowledge base. At the normalization
stage, a representation model based on intervals
has been adopted with the aim of capturing most
semantics. The annotation process relies on
patterns that distinguish among different types
and granularities of the expressions to be tagged.
Obtained results suppose a significant
improvement over our previous work. Part of this
success is due to the specific annotation
guidelines for Spanish that have been released
with occasion of the TempEval-2. It is a helpful
tool to optimize the system performance, since
each language has its own peculiarities that
should be taken into account. The promotion of a
common framework and the development of
resources like specific corpora are also very
interesting topics to boost research in the field,
since both comparative and standardized
evaluation of the systems are needed.
Several aspects should be taken into account
in future versions of the system. In order to
improve the recall new knowledge must be
incorporated to the rule engine. That supposes
the addition of new rules and annotation patterns.
This objective includes the implementation of
dictionaries with a broader coverage of
translatable temporal expressions, such as
holidays, festivities, etc.
We will also explore context extraction
techniques that facilitate the resolution of
context-aware temporal expressions.
Another pending issue is the enlargement of
the system to span the detection of events and the
relations among events and time expressions.
Finally, the system will be integrated into a
NLP application that benefits from the temporal
information management. We want to check the
improvement that the extraction of temporal
entities supposes on a traditional approach.

On the other hand, it is possible to make comparative evaluations among distinct participants looking forward the same objectives but using different approaches. Until recently, most of temporally annotated corpora, as well as temporal taggers, were available in English. Since languages as Spanish start to become prominent in the field it seems interesting the development of specific resources. Tempeval-2 has contributed to this target in a significant way thanks to the release of annotated corpora and the publication of specific guidelines (Sauri et al., 2009), (Saurí et al., 2010). This paper resumes the participation of the UC3M system in the task of determining the extent and resolving the value of time expressions in texts (Task A). This system was originally developed for the Spanish TERN task proposed in ACE 2007 evaluation (Vicente-Díez et al., 2007), achieving encouraging results although it was in a early stage of development. The system follows a ruled-based approach whose knowledge base has been inducted from the study of annotated temporal corpora (Vicente-Díez et al., 2008). A machine learning approach was initially discarded due to the limitation of annota</context>
