This ambitious book introduces readers to the study of texts using statistical methods,
focusing especially on multivariate statistics. The book is written to address the con-
cerns of students and scholars, from many different disciplines, who need to analyze
texts in their research. The authors specifically identify literary texts, historical texts,
scientific texts (e.g., for information retrieval), sociological texts (responses to socio-
economic surveys), and various types of interviews (in marketing, applied psychology,
etc.) as types of texts that could be analyzed using these techniques.
The first chapter briefly surveys some of the ways in which texts are approached
in various disciplines (linguistics, content analysis, and artificial intelligence) and in-
troduces the reader to the statistical processing of texts. A major part of the chapter is
devoted to the processing of &amp;quot;special texts&amp;quot;: responses to open questions on surveys.
This type of text is especially important in the present book, since most of the examples
presented in subsequent chapters are based on corpora of responses to open-ended
questions in socioeconomic surveys.
Chapter 2 raises the important question of what unit of analysis to use for textual
statistics. It addresses the choice between using orthographic words and lemmas, and
briefly introduces some content-based units of analysis. Surprisingly, the chapter dis-
cusses only research questions that characterize smaller linguistic units (rather than
complete texts); thus, there is no discussion of techniques that use whole texts as the
unit of analysis. Most of Chapter 2 deals with vocabulary distributions, including a
section on repeated sequences of words. Chapter 2 also briefly introduces concordance
displays and tagged corpora.
Chapters 3-8, then, present various multivariate statistical techniques used for text
analysis. These include correspondence analysis, cluster analysis, textual time series,
and discriminant analysis. While the authors give statistical formulas for many of the
procedures, detailed mathematical proofs are given only in the appendices, making
the main text accessible to a wider audience. In addition, these chapters contain many
specific examples showing how each statistical technique is applied to actual research
questions. Chapter 5 is especially noteworthy in this regard, in that it works through
examples in detail, showing how correspondence analysis and cluster analysis can be
applied to describe associations among words and among demographic groups.
My only major criticism of this book is that the actual presentation of material is
narrower than the intended goals and audience presented in the preface and introduc-
tion. The book would make an ideal introduction to statistical methods for applied

NLP work in the social sciences. Nearly all examples in the book focus on the analysis
of survey responses to questions such as &amp;quot;What is the single most important thing in
life for you?&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;What are some examples of what you would consider an &apos;ideal&apos;
meal?&amp;quot; These responses are analyzed to investigate research questions such as whether
female and male respondents from different age groups identify different things as im-
portant in their life, or whether respondents living in Paris, New York, and Tokyo have
different behaviors, habits, and food preferences. These are important research ques-
tions for the social sciences, and using computational text analysis combined with
multivariate statistical techniques allows kinds of investigation not feasible before.
However, the book is framed as a general introduction to statistical text analysis,
and in this regard it is somewhat less successful. Although many research questions
in stylistics, discourse analysis, and linguistics could be answered using these tech-
niques, the book itself provides few examples of this type. Thus, for the most part,
readers from these other disciplines will need to figure out for themselves how their
research questions relate to the kinds of examples discussed in the text, to determine
which techniques are appropriate for their applications. Nearly all examples in the
book use words or sequences of words as the observations to be analyzed. In con-
trast, linguists and discourse analysts are often interested in grammatical structures,
discourse segments, and even entire texts as observations. For example, linguists of-
ten investigate the ways in which grammatical variants are distributed systematically
across grammatical and discourse contexts. It seems that this type of research question
could be addressed through correspondence analysis, although it is very different from
the sociological research questions exemplified in the book (such as the life choices
of males versus females). Further, there is no discussion of the relation between these
techniques and other techniques such as VARBRUL, which have been used widely by
sociolinguists and discourse analysts for decades.
A more minor criticism is that the book is needlessly abstract at some points,
especially in the early chapters. For example, a table in Chapter 2 assigns a numeric
code to each of the words in a corpus, and these numbers are used in subsequent
discussion. We are told that this coding simplifies processing, but there is no indication
of how that is the case. This chapter also includes considerable discussion based on
an artificial text corpus, where each word is an arbitrary capital letter rather than an
actual word. Similarly, we are given the frequencies of some of the most common
words in Joyce&apos;s Ulysses (the 10th, 100th, 1,000th, and 10,000th most common words),
but we are not told what the words themselves are. In cases such as these, I would
have found the presentation much more accessible if actual words and corpus extracts
had been used.
However, despite these criticisms, this book should become an essential reference
work for any researcher interested in the quantitative analysis of textual data. I know
of no other book that covers the same range of topics with this amount of detail.
Although the examples are restricted primarily to a single domain of investigation,
researchers from any field who use quantitative techniques to process texts should
find much here that will be of use.
