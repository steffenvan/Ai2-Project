Appointment scheduling is a problem faced
daily by many individuals and organiza-
tions. Cooperating agent systems have
been developed to partially automate this
task. In order to extend the circle of par-
ticipants as far as possible we advocate the
use of natural language transmitted by e-
mail. We demonstrate COSMA, a fully im-
plemented German language server for ex-
isting appointment scheduling agent sys-
tems. COSMA can cope with multiple di-
alogues in parallel, and accounts for differ-
ences in dialogue behaviour between human
and machine agents.

Appointment scheduling is a problem faced daily
by many individuals and organizations, and typi-
cally solved using communication in natural lan-
guage (NL) by phone, fax or by mail. In general,
cooperative interaction between several participants
is required.
Systems available on the market allow for calendar
and contact management. However, as (Busemann
and Merget, 1995) point out in a market survey, all
planning and scheduling activity remains with the
user. Cooperative agent systems developed in the
field of Distributed AI are designed to account for
the scheduling tasks. Using distributed rather than
centralized calendar systems, they not only guaran-
tee a maximum privacy of calendar information but
also offer their services to members or employees in
external organizations. Although agent systems al-

siderable degree, the circle of participants remains
restricted to users with compatible systems.
To overcome this drawback we have designed and
implemented COSMA, a novel kind of NL dialogue
system that serves as a German language front-end
to scheduling agents. Human language makes agent
services available to a much broader public. COSMA
allows human and machine agents to participate in
appointment scheduling dialogues via e-mail. We are
concerned with meetings all participants should at-
tend and the date of which is negotiable.

2 The Systems
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998747074074074">
COSMA is organized as a client/server architecture.
The server offers NL dialogue service to multiple
client agent systems. The scheduling agent systems
act for their respective users. The agents systems
use a calendar management system for displaying to
their owners the results of the appointment negoti-
ations. The users can enter their appointment con-
straints via a graphical user interface and receive the
results either by e-mail or via their electronic calen-
dar. Agent systems are thus hooked up to e-mail, to
a calendar manager and to the dialogue server.
The server interface is command-driven. A client
may connect to the server and open up a dialogue
(see Figure 1 in (Busemann et al., 1997)). Dur-
ing the dialogue, the client may request texts to be
analyzed or semantic descriptions to be verbalized.
When given a text, the server returns the semantic
representation, and vice versa. The client ensures
that the server has available to it linguistically rel-
evant information about the interlocutors, such as
names, sexes etc.
The user agents may access the dialogue server
via Internet. They use the server as their NL front
end to human participants. Machine agents inter-
act with each other in their own formal language.
This interaction remains unnoticed by the dialogue
server. As a consequence, the dialogues modeled

within the server represent only part of the complete
multi-participant negotiation. More precisely, only
utterances between a human and a machine agent
are modeled.
The agent system used is a further development of
the PASHA system (Schmeier and Schupeta, 1996).
NL analysis in the server is based on a shallow
parsing strategy implemented in the SMES system
(Neumann et al., 1997). The use of SMES in
COSMA, semantic analysis and inference, the dia-
logue model mapping between human and machine
dialogue structures, utterance generation, the archi-
tectural framework of the server, and the PASHA
agent system are described in (Busemann et al.,
1997). Both papers can be found in the ANLP &apos;97
conference proceedings.
We demonstrate extended versions of the systems
described in (Busemann et al., 1997). In particular,
the systems to be demonstrated can process counter-
proposals, which form an important part of efficient
and cooperative scheduling dialogues.

3 The Demonstration Scenario
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999954827586207">
The demonstration scenario includes three partici-
pants. Two are using autonomous agent systems
that partially automate the negotiation of appoint-
ment scheduling and manage their users&apos; private elec-
tronic calendars. The third person plans his appoint-
ments himself and interacts with other participants
through NL e-mail messages. His calendar is man-
aged outside the scope of the systems.
Dialogues can be initiated by the human partici-
pant or by one of the agent systems. In the former
case, the users of the agent systems usually are not
involved in the negotiation. They see the result *hen
it is entered into their electronic calendars. In the
latter case, the user starts his agent by entering via
a graphical interface the appointment constraints to
be used in the negotiation. The basic constraints in-
clude the time interval within which the appointment
must be fixed, the duration of the meeting, and the
participants.
For demonstration purposes, e-mail is exchanged
between different accounts on a local host, which
the server is running on as well. In principle, each
participant and the server could reside on a different
site in the Internet.
The NL server is implemented in Common Lisp
and C with a graphical surface written in Tcl/Tk.
The PASHA agent system is implemented in DFKI-
Oz (Smolka, 1995). The systems are demonstrated
on a Sun workstation under Unix.
