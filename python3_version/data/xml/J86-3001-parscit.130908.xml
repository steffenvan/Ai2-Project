In this paper we explore a new theory of discourse structure that stresses the role of purpose and
processing in discourse. In this theory, discourse structure is composed of three separate but interre-
lated components: the structure of the sequence of utterances (called the linguistic structure), a struc-
ture of purposes (called the intentional structure), and the state of focus of attention (called the
attentional state). The linguistic structure consists of segments of the discourse into which the utter-
ances naturally aggregate. The intentional structure captures the discourse-relevant purposes,
expressed in each of the linguistic segments as well as relationships among them. The attentional state
is an abstraction of the focus of attention of the participants as the discourse unfolds. The attentional
state, being dynamic, records the objects, properties, and relations that are salient at each point of the
discourse. The distinction among these components is essential to provide an adequate explanation of
such discourse phenomena as cue phrases, referring expressions, and interruptions.
The theory of attention, intention, and aggregation of utterances is illustrated in the paper with a
number of example discourses. Various properties of discourse are described, and explanations for the
behavior of cue phrases, referring expressions, and interruptions are explored.
This theory provides a framework for describing the processing of utterances in a discourse.
Discourse processing requires recognizing how the utterances of the discourse aggregate into segments,
recognizing the intentions expressed in the discourse and the relationships among intentions, and track-
ing the discourse through the operation of the mechanisms associated with attentional state. This
processing description specifies in these recognition tasks the role of information from the discourse
and from the participants&apos; knowledge of the domain.

1 INTRODUCTION

This paper presents the basic elements of a computa-
tional theory of discourse structure that simplifies and
expands upon previous work. By specifying the basic
units a discourse comprises and the ways in which they
can relate, a proper account of discourse structure
provides the basis for an account of discourse meaning.
An account of discourse structure also plays a central
role in language processing because it stipulates
constraints on those portions of a discourse to which any
given utterance in the discourse must be related.
An account of discourse structure is closely related to
two questions: What individuates a discourse? What
makes it coherent? That is, faced with a sequence of
utterances, how does one know whether they constitute a
single discourse, several (perhaps interleaved) discourses,
or none? As we develop it, the theory of discourse struc-
ture will be seen to be intimately connected with two
nonlinguistic notions: intention and attention. Attention
is an essential factor in explicating the processing of
utterances in discourse. Intentions play a primary role in
explaining discourse structure, defining discourse coher-
ence, and providing a coherent conceptualization of the
term &amp;quot;discourse&amp;quot; itself.

The theory is a further development and integration of
two lines of research: work on focusing in discourse
(Grosz 1978a, 1978b, 1981) and more recent work on
intention recognition in discourse (Sidner and Israel
1981; Sidner 1983; 1985; Allen 1983, Litman 1985;
Pollack 1986). Our goal has been to generalize these
constructs properly to a wide range of discourse types.
Grosz (1978a) demonstrated that the notions of focusing
and task structure are necessary for understanding and
producing task-oriented dialogue. One of the main
generalizations of previous work will be to show that
discourses are generally in some sense &amp;quot;task-oriented,&amp;quot;
but the kinds of &amp;quot;tasks&amp;quot; that can be engaged in are quite
varied — some are physical, some mental, others linguis-
tic. Consequently, the term &amp;quot;task&amp;quot; is misleading; we
therefore will use the more general terminology of
intentions (e.g., when speaking of discourse purposes) for
most of what we say.
Our main thesis is that the structure of any discourse is
a composite of three distinct but interacting components:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999736">
• the structure of the actual sequence of utterances in the
discourse;
• a structure of intentions;
• an attentional state.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999976571428572">
The distinction among these components is essential to
an explanation of interruptions (see Section 5), as well as
to explanations of the use of certain types of referring
expressions (see Section 4.2) and various other
expressions that affect discourse segmentation and struc-
ture (see Section 6). Most related work on discourse
structure (including Reichman-Adar 1984, Linde 1979,
Linde and Goguen 1978, Cohen 1983) fails to distin-
guish among some (or, in some cases, all) of these
components. As a result, significant generalizations are
lost, and the computational mechanisms proposed are
more complex than necessary. By carefully distinguish-
ing these components, we are able to account for signif-
icant observations in this related work while simplifying
both the explanations given and computational mech-
anisms used.
In addition to explicating these linguistic phenomena,
the theory provides an overall framework within which to
answer questions about the relevance of various
segments of discourse to one another and to the overall
purposes of the discourse participants. Various proper-
ties of the intentional component have implications for
research in natural-language processing in general. In
particular, the intentions that underlie discourse are so
diverse that approaches to discourse coherence based on
selecting discourse relationships from a fixed set of alter-
native rhetorical patterns (e.g., Hobbs 1979, Mann and
Thompson 1983, Reichman 1981) are unlikely to suffice.
The intentional structure introduced in this paper
depends instead on a small number of structural relations
that can hold between intentions. This study also reveals
several problems that must be confronted in expanding
speech-act-related theories (e.g., Allen and Perrault
1980, Cohen and Levesque 1980, Allen 1983) from
coverage of individual utterances to coverage of extended
sequences of utterances in discourse.
Although a definition of discourse must await further
development of the theory presented in this paper, some
properties of the phenomena we want to explain must be
specified now. In particular, we take a discourse to be a
piece of language behavior that typically involves multi-
ple utterances and multiple participants. A discourse
may be produced by one or more of these participants as
speakers or writers; the audience may comprise one or
more of the participants as hearers or readers. Because
in multi-party conversations more than one participant
may speak (or write) different utterances within a
segment, the terms speaker and hearer do not differen-
tiate the unique roles that the participants maintain in a
segment of a conversation. We will therefore use the
terms initiating conversational participant (ICP) and other
conversational participant(s) (OCP) to distinguish the initi-
ator of a discourse segment from its other participants.
The ICP speaks (or writes) the first utterance of a
segment, but an OCP may be the speaker of some subse-
quent utterances. By speaking of ICPs and OCPs, we can
highlight the purposive aspect of discourse. We will use
the terms speaker and hearer only when the particular
speaking/hearing activity is important for the point being
made.
In most of this paper, we will be concerned with
developing an abstract model of discourse structure; in
particular, the definitions of the components will abstract
away from the details of the discourse participants.
Whether one constructs a computer system that can
participate in a discourse (i.e., one that is a language
user) or defines a psychological theory of language use,
the task will require the appropriate projection of this
abstract model onto properties of a language user, and
specification of additional details (e.g., specifying memo-
ry for linguistic structure, means for encoding attentional
state, and appropriate representations of intentional
structure). We do, however, address ourselves directly to
certain processing issues that are essential to the compu-
tational validity of the [abstract] model and to its utiliza-
tion for a language-processing system or psychological
theory.
Finally, it is important to note that although discourse
meaning is a significant, unsolved problem, we will not
address it in this paper. An adequate theory of discourse
meaning needs to rest at least partially on an adequate
theory of discourse structure. Our concern is with provid-
ing the latter.
The next section examines the basic theory of
discourse structure and presents an overview of each of
the components of discourse structure. Section 3
analyzes two sample discourses — a written text and a
fragment of task-oriented dialogue — from the perspec-
tive of the theory being developed; these two examples
are also used to illustrate various points in the remainder
of the paper. Section 4 investigates various processing

issues that the theory raises. The following two sections
describe the role of the discourse structure components
in explaining various properties of discourse, thereby

three components. Section 7 describes the generalization

2 THE BASIC THEORY
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999941379310345">
Discourse structure is a composite of three interacting
constituents: a linguistic structure, an intentional struc-
ture, and an attentional state. These three constituents
of discourse structure deal with different aspects of the
utterances in a discourse. Utterances — the actual saying
or writing of particular sequences of phrases and clauses
— are the linguistic structure&apos;s basic elements. Intentions
of a particular sort and a small number of relationships
between them provide the basic elements of the inten-
tional structure. Attentional state contains information
about the objects, properties, relations, and discourse
intentions that are most salient at any given point. It is
an abstraction of the focus of attention of the discourse
participants; it serves to summarize information from
previous utterances crucial for processing subsequent
ones, thus obviating the need for keeping a complete
history of the discourse.
Together the three constituents of discourse structure
supply the information needed by the CPs to determine
how an individual utterance fits with the rest of the
discourse — in essence, enabling them to figure out why it
was said and what it means. The context provided by
these constituents also forms the basis for certain expec-
tations about what is to come; these expectations play a
role in accommodating new utterances. The attentional
state serves an additional purpose: namely, it furnishes
the means for actually using the information in the other
two structures in generating and interpreting individual
utterances.

2.1 LINGUISTIC STRUCTURE
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999492285714286">
The first component of discourse structure is the struc-
ture of the sequence of utterances that comprise a
discourse.1 Just as the words in a single sentence form
constituent phrases, the utterances in a discourse are
naturally aggregated into discourse segments. The utter-
ances in a segment, like the words in a phrase, serve
particular roles with respect to that segment. In addition,
the discourse segments, like the phrases, fulfill certain
functions with respect to the overall discourse. Although
two consecutive utterances may be in the same discourse
segment, it is also common for two consecutive utter-
ances to be in different segments. It is also possible for
two utterances that are nonconsecutive to be in the same
segment.

The factoring of discourses into segments has been
observed across a wide range of discourse types. Grosz
(1978a) showed this for task-oriented dialogues. Linde
(1979) found it valid for descriptions of apartments;
Linde and Goguen (1978) describe such structuring in
the Watergate transcripts. Reichman-Adar (1984)
observed it in informal debates, explanations, and thera-
peutic discourse. Cohen (1983) found similar structures
in essays in rhetorical texts. Polanyi and Scha (1986)
discuss this feature of narratives.
Although different researchers with different theories
have examined a variety of discourse types and found
discourse-level segmentation, there has been very little
investigation of the extent of agreement about where the
segment boundaries lie. There have been no psycholog-
ical studies of the consistency of recognition of section
boundaries. However, Mann (Mann et al. 1975) asked
several people to segment a set of dialogues. He has
reported [personal communication] that his subjects
segmented the discourses approximately the same; their
disagreements were about utterances at the boundaries of
segments.2 Several studies of spontaneously produced
discourses provide additional evidence of the existence of
segment boundaries, as well as suggesting some of the
linguistic cues available for detecting boundaries. Chafe
(1979, 1980) found differences in pause lengths at
segment boundaries. Butterworth (1975) found speech
rate differences that correlated with segments; speech
rate is slower at start of a segment than toward the end.
The linguistic structure consists of the discourse
segments and an embedding relationship that can hold
between them. As we discuss in Sections 2.2 and 5, the
embedding relationships are a surface reflection of
relationships among elements of the intentional structure.
It is important to recognize that the linguistic structure is
not strictly decompositional. An individual segment may
include a combination of subsegments and utterances
only in that segment (and not members of any of its
embedded subsegments). Both of the examples in Section
3 exhibit such nonstrict decompositionality. Because the
linguistic structure is not strictly decompositional, various
properties of the discourse (most notably the intentional
structure) are functions of properties of individual utter-
ances and properties of segments.
There is a two-way interaction between the discourse
segment structure and the utterances constituting the
discourse: linguistic expressions can be used to convey
information about the discourse structure; conversely,
the discourse structure constrains the interpretation of
expressions (and hence affects what a speaker says and
how a hearer will interpret what is said). Not surprising-
ly, linguistic expressions are among the primary indica-
tors of discourse segment boundaries. The explicit use of
certain words and phrases (e.g., in the first place) and
more subtle cues, such as intonation or changes in tense
and aspect, are included in the repertoire of linguistic
devices that function, wholly or in part, to indicate these

boundaries (Grosz 1978a, Reichman-Adar 1984, Cohen
1983, Polanyi and Scha 1983, Hirschberg and Pierre-
humbert 1986). Reichman (1981) discusses some words
that function in this way and coined the term clue words.
We will use the term cue phrases to generalize on her
observation as well as many others because each one of
these devices cue the hearer to some change in the
discourse structure.
As discussed in Section 6, these linguistic boundary
markers can be divided according to whether they explic-
itly indicate changes in the intentional structure or in the
attentional state of the discourse. The differential use of
these linguistic markers provides one piece of evidence
for considering these two components to be distinct.
Because these linguistic devices function explicitly as
indicators of discourse structure, it becomes clear that
they are best seen as providing information at the
discourse level, and not at the sentence level; hence,
certain kinds of questions (e.g., about their contribution
to the truth conditions of an individual sentence) do not
make sense. For example, in the utterance Incidentally,
Jane swims every day, the incidentally indicates an inter-
ruption of the main flow of discourse rather than affect-
ing in any way the meaning of Jane swims every day.
Jane&apos;s swimming every day could hardly be fortuitous.
Just as linguistic devices affect structure, so the
discourse segmentation affects the interpretation of
linguistic expressions in a discourse. Referring
expressions provide the primary example of this effect.3
The segmentation of discourse constrains the use of
referring expressions by delineating certain points at
which there is a significant change in what entities
(objects, properties, or relations) are being discussed.
For example, there are different constraints on the use of
pronouns and reduced definite-noun phrases within a
segment than across segment boundaries. While
discourse segmentation is obviously not the only factor
governing the use of referring expressions, it is an impor-
tant one.

2.2 INTENTIONAL STRUCTURE
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99863005479452">
A rather straightforward property of discourses, namely,
that they (or, more accurately, those who participate in
them) have an overall purpose, turns out to play a funda-
mental role in the theory of discourse structure. In
particular, some of the purposes that underlie discourses,
and their component segments, provide the means of
individuating discourses and of distinguishing discourses
that are coherent from those that are not. These
purposes also make it possible to determine when a
sequence of utterances comprises more than one
discourse.
Although typically the participants in a discourse may
have more than one aim in participating in the discourse
(e.g., a story may entertain its listeners as well as
describe an event; an argument may establish a person&apos;s
brilliance as well as convince someone that a claim or
allegation is true), we distinguish one of these purposes
as foundational to the discourse. We will refer to it as the
discourse purpose (DP). From an intuitive perspective, the
discourse purpose is the intention that underlies engaging
in the particular discourse. This intention provides both
the reason a discourse (a linguistic act), rather than some
other action, is being performed and the reason the
particular content of this discourse is being conveyed
rather than some other information. For each of the
discourse segments, we can also single out one intention
— the discourse segment purpose (DSP). From an intuitive
standpoint, the DSP specifies how this segment contrib-
utes to achieving the overall discourse purpose. The
assumption that there are single such intentions will in
the end prove too strong. However, this assumption
allows us to describe the basic theory mare clearly. We
must leave to future research (and a subsequent paper)
the exploration and discussion of the complications that
result from relaxing this assumption.
Typically, an ICP will have a number of different kinds
of intentions that lead to initiating a discourse. One kind
might include intentions to speak in a certain language or
to utter certain words. Another might include intentions
to amuse or to impress. The kinds of intentions that can
serve as discourse purposes or discourse segment
purposes are distinguished from other intentions by the
fact that they are intended to be recognized (cf. Allen
and Perrault 1980, Sidner 1985), whereas other
intentions are private; that is, the recognition of the DP
or DSP is essential to its achieving its intended effect.
Discourse purposes and discourse segment purposes
share this property with certain utterance-level intentions
that Grice (1969) uses in defining utterance meaning
(see Section 7).
It is important to distinguish intentions that are
intended to be recognized from other kinds of intentions
that are associated with discourse. Intentions that are
intended to be recognized achieve their intended effect
only if the intention is recognized. For example, a
compliment achieves its intended effect only if the inten-
tion to compliment is recognized; in contrast, a scream of
boo typically achieves its intended effect (scaring the
hearer) without the hearer having to recognize the speak-
er&apos;s intention.
Some intention that is private and not intended to be
recognized may be the primary motivation for an ICP to
begin a discourse. For example, the ICP may intend to
impress someone or may plan to teach someone. In
neither case is the ICP&apos;s intention necessarily intended to
be recognized. Quite the opposite may be true in the
case of impressing, as the ICP may not want the OCP to
be aware of his intention. When teaching, the ICP may
not care whether the OCP knows the ICP is teaching him
or her. Thus, the intention that motivates the ICP to
engage in a discourse may be private. By contrast, the
discourse segment purpose is always intended to be
recognized.

DPs and DSPs are basically the same sorts of
intentions. If an intention is a DP, then its satisfaction is a
main purpose of the discourse, whereas if it is a DSP,
then its satisfaction contributes to the satisfaction of the
DP. The following are some of the types of intentions
that could serve as DP/DSPs, followed by one example of
each type.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.997773266666667">
1. Intend that some agent intend to perform some phys-
ical task. Example: Intend that Ruth intend to fix the
flat tire.
2. Intend that some agent believe some fact. Example:
Intend that Ruth believe the campfire has started.
3. Intend that some agent believe that one fact supports
another. Example: Intend that Ruth believe the smell
of smoke provides evidence that the campfire is started.
4. Intend that some agent intend to identify an object
(existing physical object, imaginary object, plan,
event, event sequence). Example: Intend that Ruth
intend to identify my bicycle.
5. Intend that some agent know some property of an
object. Example: Intend that Ruth know that my bicy-
cle has a flat tire.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999741314285714">
We have identified two structural relations that play
an important role in discourse structure: dominance and
satisfaction-precedence. An action that satisfies one
intention, say DSP1, may be intended to provide part of
the satisfaction of another, say DSP2. When this is the
case, we will say that DSP1 contributes to DSP2;
conversely, we will say that DSP2 dominates DSP1 (or
DSP2 DOM DSP1). The dominance relation invokes a
partial ordering on DSPs that we will refer to as the domi-
nance hierarchy. For some discourses, including task-or-
iented ones, the order in which the DSPs are satisfied
may be significant, as well as being intended to be recog-
nized. We will say that DSP1 satisfaction-precedes DSP2
(or, DSP1 SP DSP2) whenever DSP1 must be satisfied
before DSP2.4
Any of the intentions on the preceding list could be
either a DP or a DSP. Furthermore, a given instance of
any one of them could contribute to another, or to a
different, instance of the same type. For example, the
intention that someone intend to identify some object
might dominate several intentions that she or he know
some property of that object; likewise, the intention to
get someone to believe some fact might dominate a
number of contributing intentions that that person
believe other facts.
As the above list makes clear, the range of intentions
that can serve as discourse, or discourse segment,
purposes is open-ended (cf. Wittgenstein 1953: para-
graph 23), much like the range of intentions that underlie
more general purposeful action. There is no finite list of
discourse purposes, as there is, say, of syntactic catego-
ries. It remains an unresolved research question whether
there is a finite description of the open-ended set of such
intentions. However, even if there were finite
descriptions, there would still be no finite list of

intentions from which to choose. Thus, a theory of
discourse structure cannot depend on choosing the
DP/DSPs from a fixed list (cf. Reichman-Adar 1984,
Schank et al. 1982, Mann and Thompson 1983), nor on
the particulars of individual intentions. Although the
particulars of individual intentions, like a wide range of
common sense knowledge, are crucial to understanding
any discourse, such particulars cannot serve as the basis
for determining discourse structure.
What is essential for discourse structure is that such
intentions bear certain kinds of structural relationships to
one another. Since the CPs can never know the whole
set of intentions that might serve as DP/DSPs, what they
must recognize is the relevant structural relationships
among intentions. Although there is an infinite number
of intentions, there are only a small number of relations
relevant to discourse structure that can hold between
them.
In this paper we distinguish between the determination
of the DSP and the recognition of it. We use the term
determination to refer to a semantic-like notion, namely,
the complete specification of what is intended by whom;
we use the term recognition to refer to a processing
notion, namely, the processing that leads a discourse
participant to identify what the intention is. These are
obviously related concepts; the same information that
determines a DSP may be used by an OCP to recognize it.
However, some questions are relevant to only one of
them. For example, the question of when the informa-
tion becomes available is not relevant to determination
but is crucial to recognition. An analogous distinction
has been drawn with respect to sentence structure; the
parse tree (determination) is differentiated from the pars-
ing process (recognition) that produces the tree.

2.3 ATTENTIONAL STATE
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995426809523809">
The third component of discourse structure, the atten-
tional state, is an abstraction of the participants&apos; focus of
attention as their discourse unfolds. The attentional state
is a property of the discourse itself, not of the discourse
participants. It is inherently dynamic, recording the
objects, properties, and relations that are salient at each
point in the discourse. The attentional state is modeled
by a set of focus spaces; changes in attentional state are
modeled by a set of transition rules that specify the
conditions for adding and deleting spaces. We call the
collection of focus spaces available at any one time the
focusing structure and the process of manipulating spaces
focusing.
The focusing process associates a focus space with
each discourse segment; this space contains those entities
that are salient — either because they have been
mentioned explicitly in the segment or because they
became salient in the process of producing or compre-
hending the utterances in the segment (as in the original
work on focusing: Grosz 1978a). The focus space also
includes the DSP; the inclusion of the purpose reflects the

fact that the CPs are focused not only on what they are
talking about, but also on why they are talking about it.
To understand the attentional state component of
discourse structure, it is important not to confuse it with
two other concepts. First, the attentional state compo-
nent is not equivalent to cognitive state, but is only one
of its components. Cognitive state is a richer structure,
one that includes at least the knowledge, beliefs, desires,
and intentions of an agent, as well as the cognitive corre-
lates of the attentional state as modeled in this paper.
Second, although each focus space contains a DSP, the
focus structure does not include the intentional structure
as a whole.
Figure 1 illustrates how the focusing structure, in addi-
tion to modeling attentional state, serves during process-
ing to coordinate the linguistic and intentional structures.
The discourse segments (to the left of the figure) are tied
to focus spaces (drawn vertically down the middle of the
figure). The focusing structure is a stack. Information in
lower spaces is usually accessible from higher ones (but
less so than the information in the higher spaces); we use
a line with intersecting hash marks to denote when this is
not the case. Subscripted terms are used to indicate the
relevant contents of the focus spaces because the spaces
contain representations of entities (i.e., objects, proper-
ties, and relations) and not linguistic expressions.
Part one of Figure 1 shows the state of focusing when
discourse segment DS2 is being processed. Segment DS1
gave rise to FS1 and had as its discourse purpose DSPi.
The properties, objects, relations, and purpose repres-
ented in FS1 are accessible but less salient than those in
FS2. DS2 yields a focus space that is stacked relative to
FS1 because DSP, of DS1 dominates DS2&apos;s DSP, DSP2. As
a result of the relationship between FS1 and FS2, reduced
noun phrases will be interpreted differently in DS2 than
in DS1. For example, if some red balls exist in the world
one of which is represented in DS2 and another in FS1,
then the red ball used in DS2 will be understood to mean
the particular red ball that is represented in DS2. If,
however, there is also a green truck (in the world) and it
is represented only in FS1, the green truck uttered in DS2
will be understood as referring to that green truck.
Part two of Figure 1 shows the state of focusing when
segment DS3 is being processed. FS2 has been popped
from the stack and FS3 has been pushed onto it because
the DSP of DS3, DSP3, is dominated solely by DSPi, not
by DSP2. In this example, the intentional structure
includes only dominance relationships, although, it may,
in general, also include satisfaction-precedence relation-
ships.
The stacking of focus spaces reflects the relative sali-
ence of the entities in each space during the correspond-
ing segment&apos;s portion of the discourse. The stack
relationships arise from the ways in which the various
DSPs relate; information about such relationships is
represented in the dominance hierarchy (depicted on the
right in the figure). The spaces in Figure 1 are• snapshots
illustrating the results of a sequence of operations, such
as pushes onto and pops from a stack. A push occurs
when the DSP for a new segment contributes to the DSP
for the immediately preceding segment. When the DSP
contributes to some intention higher in the dominance
hierarchy, several focus spaces are popped from the stack
before the new one is inserted.
Two essential properties of the focusing structure are
now clear. First, the focusing structure is parasitic upon
the intentional structure, in the sense that the relation-
ships among DSPs determine pushes and pops. Note
however, that the relevant operation may sometimes be
indicated in the language itself. For example, the cue
word first often indicates the start of a segment whose
DSP contributes to the DSP of the preceding segment.
Second, the focusing structure, like the intentional and
linguistic structures, evolves as the discourse proceeds.
None of them exists a priori. Even in those rare cases in
which an ICP has a complete plan for the discourse prior
to uttering a single word, the intentional structure is
constructed by the CPs as the discourse progresses. This
discourse-time construction of the intentional structure
may be more obviously true for speakers and hearers of
spoken discourse than for readers and writers of texts,
but, even for the writer, the intentional structure is devel-
oped as the text is being written.
Figure 1 illustrates some fundamental distinctions
between the intentional and attentional components of
discourse structure. First, the dominance hierarchy
provides, among other things, a complete record of the
discourse-level intentions and their dominance (as well
as, when relevant, satisfaction-precedence) relationships,
whereas the focusing structure at any one time can essen-
tially contain only information that is relevant to
purposes in a portion of the dominance hierarchy.
Second, at the conclusion of a discourse, if it completes
normally, the focus stack will be empty, while the inten-
tional structure will have been fully constructed. Third,
when the discourse is being processed, only the atten-
tional state can constrain the interpretation of referring
expressions directly.
We can now also clarify some misinterpretations of
focus-space diagrams and task structure in our earlier
work (Grosz 1978a, 1981, 1974). The focus-space hier-
archies in that work are best seen as representing atten-
tional state. The task structure was used in two ways:
</bodyText>

1. to represent common knowledge about the task;
2. as a special case of the intentional structure we posit
in this paper.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9768765">
Although the same representational scheme was used for
encoding the focus-space hierarchies and the task struc-
ture (partitioned networks: Hendrix 1979), the two
structures were distinct.

Barbara J. Grosz and Candace L. Sidner Attention, Intentions, and the Structure of Discourse
Several researchers (e.g., Linde and Goguen 1978,
Reichman-Adar 1984) misinterpreted the original
research in an unfortunate and unintended way: they
took the focus-space hierarchy to include (or be identical
to) the task structure. The conflation of these two struc-
tures forces a single structure to contain information
about attentional state, intentional relationships, and
general task, knowledge. It prevents a theory from
accounting adequately for certain aspects of discourse,
including interruptions (see Section 5).
A second instance of confusion was to infer (incor-
rectly) that the task structure was necessarily a prebuilt
tree. If the task structure is taken to be a special case of
intentional structure, it becomes clear that the tree struc-
ture is simply a more constrained structure than one
might require for other discourses; the nature of the task
related to the task-oriented discourse is such that the
dominance hierarchy of the intentional structure of the
dialogue has both dominance and satisfaction-precedence
relationships,5 while other discourses may not exhibit
significant precedence constraints among the DSPs.
Furthermore, there has never been any reason to assume
that the task structures in task-oriented dialogues are
prebuilt, any more than the intentional structure of any
other kind of discourses. It is rather that one objective of
discourse theory (not a topic considered here, however)
is to explain how the OCP builds up a model of the task
structure by using information supplied in the discourse.
However, it is important to note that conflating the
aforementioned two roles of information about the task
itself (as a portion of general commonsense knowledge
and as a special case of intentional structure) was regret-
table, as it fails to make an important distinction.
Furthermore, as is clear when intentional structures are
considered more generally, such a conflation of roles
does not allow for differences between what one knows
about a task and one&apos;s intentions for (or what one makes
explicit in discourse about) performing a task.
In summary, the focusing structure is the central
repository for the contextual information needed to proc-
ess utterances at each point in the discourse. It distin-
guishes those objects, properties, and relations that are
most salient at that point and, moreover, has links to
relevant parts of both the linguistic and intentional struc-
tures. During a discourse, an increasing amount of infor-
mation, only some of which continues to be needed for
the interpretation of subsequent utterances, is discussed.
Hence, it becomes more and more necessary to be able
to identify relevant discourse segments, the entities they
make salient, and their DSPs. The role of attentional
state in delineating the information necessary for under-
standing is thus central to discourse processing.

3 Two EXAMPLES
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999987">
To illustrate the basic theory we have just sketched, we
will give a brief analysis of two kinds of discourse: an
argument from a rhetoric text and a task-oriented
dialogue. For each example we discuss the segmentation
of the discourse, the intentions that underlie this segmen-
tation, and the relationships among the various DSPs. In
each case, we point out some of the linguistic devices
used to indicate segment boundaries as well as some of
the expressions whose interpretations depend on those
boundaries. The analysis is concerned with specifying
certain aspects of the behavior to be explicated by a
theory of discourse; the remainder of the paper provides
a partial account of this behavior.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999468">
3.1 AN ARGUMENT
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99970845">
Our first example is an argument taken from a rhetoric
text (Holmes and Gallagher 19176). It is an example used
by Cohen (1983) in her work on the structure of argu-
ments. Figure 2 shows the dialogue and the eight
discourse segments of which it is composed. The division
of the argument into separate (numbered) clauses is
Cohen&apos;s, but our analysis of the discourse structure is
different, since in Cohen&apos;s analysis, every utterance is
directly subordinated to another utterance, and there is
only one structure to encode linguistic segmentation and
the purposes of utterances. Although both analyses
segment utterance (4) separately from utterances (1-3),
some readers place this utterance in DS1 with utterances
(1) through (3); this is an example of the kind of disa-
greement about boundary utterances found in Mann&apos;s
data (as discussed in Section 2.1). The two placements
lead to slightly different DSPs, but not to radically differ-
ent intentional structures. Because the differences do not
affect the major thrust of the argument, we will discuss
only one segmentation.

All the primary intentions for this essay are intentions
that the reader (OCP) come to believe some proposition.
Some of these propositions, such as P5 and P6, can be
read off the surface utterances directly. Other prop-
ositions and the intentions of which they are part, such as
P2 and 12, ar,e mote indirect. Like the Gricean utter-
ancetlevel intentions (the analogy with these will be
explored in Section 7), DSPs may or may not be directly
expressed in the discourse. In particular, they may be
expressed in any of the following ways:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9903419">
1. explicitly as in I intend for you to believe that it&apos;s time

2. directly, in one utterance, as in (3) [which does
produce Ill
3. directly, through multiple utterances, as in using (7)
and the utterance It can only be harmful to produce

4. by derivation, in one or more utterances with an associ-
ated context, as in (15) to produce 12.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999960324324324">
Not only may information about the DSP be conveyed
by a number of features of the utterances in a discourse,
but it also may come in any utterance in a segment. For
example, although IO is the DP, it is stated directly only in
the last utterance of the essay. This leads to a number of
questions about the ways in which OCPs can recognize
discourse purposes, and about those junctures at which
they need to do so. We turn to these matters directly in
Subsection 4.1.
This discourse also provides several examples of the
different kinds of interactions that can hold between the
linguistic expressions in a discourse and the discourse
structure. It includes examples of the devices that may be
used to mark overtly the boundaries between discourse
segments — examples of the use of aspect, mood, and
particular cue phrases — as well as of the use of referring
expressions that are affected by discourse segment boun-
daries.
The use of cue phrases to indicate discourse bounda-
ries is illustrated in utterances (9) and (11); in (9) the
phrase in the first place marks the beginning of DS5 while
in (11) moreover ends DS5 and marks the start of DS6.
These phrases also carry information about the inten-
tional structure, namely, that DSP5 and DSP6 are domi-
nated by DSP4. In some cases, cue phrases have multiple
functions; they convey propositional content as well as
marking discourse segment boundaries. The but in utter-
ance (7) is an example of such a multiple function use.
The boundaries between DS1 and DS2, DS4 and DS5,
and DS4 and DS2 reflect changes of aspect and mood.
The switch from declarative, present tense to interroga-
tive modal aspect does not in itself seem to signal the
boundary (for recognition purposes) in this discourse
unambiguously, but it does indicate a possible line of
demarcation which, in fact, is valid.
The effect of segmentation on referring expressions is
shown by the use of the generic noun phrase a moving

picture show in (4). Although a reference to the movies
was made with a pronoun (their) in (3), a full noun
phrase is used in (4). This use reflects, and perhaps in
part marks, the boundary between the segments DS1 and
DS2.
Finally, this discourse has an example of the trade-off
between explicitly marking a discourse boundary, as well
as the relationship between the associated DSPs, and
reasoning about the intentions themselves. There is no
overt linguistic marker of the beginning of DS7; its sepa-
ration must be inferred from DSP7 and its relationship to
DSP6.

3.2 A TASK-ORIENTED DIALOGUE
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999973547619047">
The second example is a fragment of a task-oriented
dialogue taken from Grosz (1981; it is from the same
corpus that was used by Grosz 1974). Figure 5 contains
the dialogue fragment and indicates the boundaries for its
main segments.7 Figure 6 gives the primary component of
the DSPs for this fragment and shows the dominance
rela,1ionships between them.
In contrast with the movies essay, the primary compo-
nents of the DSPs in this dialogue are mostly intentions of
the segment&apos;s ICP that the OCP intend to perform some
action. Also, unlike the essay, the dialogue has two
agents initiating the different discourse segments. In this
particular segment, the expert is the ICP of DS1 and DS5,
while the apprentice is the ICP of DS2-4. To furnish a
complete account of the intentional structure of this
discourse, one must be able to say how the satisfaction of
one agent&apos;s intentions can contribute to satisfying the
intentions of another agent. Such an account is beyond
the scope of this paper, but in Section 7 we discuss some
of the complexities involved in providing one (as well as
its role in discourse theory).
For the purposes of discussing this example, though,
we need to postulate two properties of the relationships
among the participants&apos; intentions. These properties
seem to be rooted in features of cooperative behavior
and depend on the two participants&apos; sharing some partic-
ular knowledge of the task. First, it is a shared belief
that, unless he states otherwise, the OCP will adopt the
intention to perform an action that the ICP intended him
to. Second, in adopting the intention to carry out that
action, the OCP also intends to perform whatever
subactions are necessary. Thus, once the apprentice
intends to remove the flywheel, he also commits himself
to the collateral intentions of loosening the setscrews and
pulling the wheel off. Note, however, that not all the
subactions need to be introduced explicitly into the
discourse. The apprentice may do several actions that are
never mentioned, and the expert may assume that these
are being undertaken on the basis of other information
that the apprentice obtains. The partiality of the inten-
tional structure stems to some extent from these charac-
teristics of intentions and actions.

As in the movies essay, some of the DSPs for this
dialogue are expressed directly in utterances. For
instance, utterances (1), (5), and (12) directly express
the primary components of DSP!, DSP2 and DSP3,
respectively. The primary component of DSP4 is a
derived intention. The surface intention of but I&apos;m
having trouble getting the wheel off is that the apprentice
intends the expert to believe that the apprentice is having
trouble taking off the flywheel. 14 is derived from the
utterance and its surface intention, as well as from
features of discourse, conventions about what intentions
are associated with the I am having trouble doing X type
of utterance, and what the ICP and OCP know about the
task they have undertaken.
The dominance relationship that holds between Il and
12, as well as the one that holds between Il and 13, may
seem problematic at first glance. It is not clear how
locating any single setscrew contributes to removing the
flywheel. It is even less clear how, in and of itself, identi-
fying another tool does. Two facts provide the link. first,
that the apprentice (the OCP of DS1) has taken on the
task of removing the flywheel; second, that the appren-
tice and expert share certain knowledge about the task.
Some of this shared task knowledge comes from the
discourse per se [e.g., utterance (3)], but some of it

comes from general knowledge, perceptual information,
and the like. Thus, a combination of information is rele-
vant to determining 12 and 13 and their relationships to
1, including all of the following: the fact that Ii is part
of the intentional structure, the fact that the apprentice is
currently working on satisfying Ii, the utterance-level
intentions of utterances (5) and (12), and general know-
ledge about the task.
The satisfaction-precedence relations among 12, 13,
and 14 are not communicated directly in the dialogue,
but, like dominance relations, depend on domain know-
ledge. One piece of relevant knowledge is that a satisfac-
tion precedence relation exists between loosening the
setscrews and pulling off the flywheel. That relation is
shared knowledge that is stated directly (First loosen ...,
then pull). The relation, along with the fact that both 12
and 13 contribute to loosening the setscrews, and that 14
contributes to pulling off the flywheel, makes it possible
to conclude 13 SP 14 and 12 SP 14. To conclude that 12
SP 13, the apprentice must employ knowledge of how to
go about loosening screw-like objects.
The dominance and satisfaction-precedence relations
for this task-oriented fragment form a tree of intentions
rather than just a partial ordering. In general, however,
for any fragment, task-oriented or otherwise, this is not
necessary.
It is essential to notice that the intentional structure is
neither identical to nor isomorphic to a general plan for
removing the flywheel. It is not identical because a plan
encompasses more than a collection of intentions and
relationships between them (compare Pollack&apos;s (1986)
critique of Al planning formalisms as the basis for infer-
ring intentions in discourse). It is not isomorphic because
the intentional structure has a different substructure from
the general plan for removing the flywheel. In addition
to the intentions arising from steps in the plan, the inten-
tional structure typically contains DSPs corresponding to
intentions generated by the particular execution of the
task and the dialogue. For example, the general plan for
the disassembly of a flywheel includes subplans for loos-
ening the setscrews and pulling off the wheel; it might
also include subplans (of the loosening step) for finding
the setscrews, finding a tool with which to loosen the
screws, and loosening each screw individually. However,
this plan would not contain contingency subplans for
what to do when one cannot find the screws or realizes
that the available tool is unsatisfactory. Intentions 12 and
13 stem from difficulties encountered in locating and
loosening the setscrews. Thus, the intentional structure
for this fragment is not isomorphic to the general plan for
removing the flywheel.
Utterance (18) offers another example of the differ-
ence between the intentional structure and a general plan
for the task. This utterance is part of DS4 — not just part
of DS1 — even though it contains references to more than
one single part of the overall task (which is what Ii is
about). It functions to establish a new DSP, 14, as most
salient. Rather than being regarded as a report on the
overall status of the task, the first clause is best seen as
modifying the DSP.8 With it, the apprentice tells the
expert that the trouble in removing the wheel is not with
the screws. Thus, although general task knowledge is
used in determining the intentional structure, it is not
identical to it.
In this dialogue, there are fewer instances in which cue
phrases are employed to indicate segment boundaries
than occur in the movies essay. The primary example is
the use of first in (1) to mark the start of the segment
and to indicate that its DSP is the first of several
intentions whose satisfaction will contribute to satisfying
the larger discourse of which they are a part.

The dialogue includes a clear example of the influence
of discourse structure on referring expressions. The
phrase the screw in the center is used in (25) to refer to
the center screw of the wheelpuller, not one of the two
setscrews mentioned in (18). This use of the phrase is
possible because of the attentional state of the discourse

4 PROCESSING ISSUES
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999048555555555">
In previous sections of the paper, we abstracted from the
cognitive states of the discourse participants. The various
components of discourse structure discussed so far are
properties of the discourse itself, not of the discourse
participants. To use the theory in constructing computa-
tional models requires determining how each of the indi-
vidual components projects onto the model of an
individual discourse participant. In this regard, the prin-
cipal issues include specifying

<listItem confidence="0.9986926">
1. how the ICP indicates and the OCP recognizes the
beginning and end of a discourse segment,
2. how the OCP recognizes the discourse segment
purposes, and
3. how the focus space stack operates.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999083">
In essence, the OCP must judge for each utterance
whether it starts a new segment, ends the current one
(and possibly some of its embedding segments), or
contributes to the current one. The information available
to the OCP for recognizing that an utterance starts a new
segment includes any explicit linguistic cues contained in
the utterance (see Section 69) as well as the relationship
between its utterance-level intentions and the active DSPs
(i.e., those in some focus space that is still on the stack).
Likewise, the fact that an utterance ends a segment may
be indicated explicitly by linguistic cues or implicitly from
its utterance-level intentions and their relationship to
elements of the intentional structure. If neither of these is
the case, the utterance is part of the current segment.
Thus, intention recognition and focus space management
play key roles in processing. Moreover, they are also
related: the intentional structure is a primary factor in
determining focus space changes, and the focus space
structure helps constrain the intention recognition proc-
ess.

4.1 INTENTION RECOGNITION
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999986586956522">
The recognition of DP/DSPs is the central issue in the
computational modeling of intentional structure. If, as
we have claimed, for the discourse to be coherent and
comprehensible, the OCP must be able to recognize both
the DP/DSPsl° and relationships (dominance and satis-
faction-precedence) between them, then the question of
how the OCP does so is a crucial issue.
For the discourse as a whole, as well as for each of its
segments, the OCP must identify both the intention that
serves as the discourse segment purpose and its relation-
ship to other discourse-level intentions. In particular, the
OCP must be able to recognize which other DSPs that
specific intention dominates and is dominated by, and,
where relevant, with which other DSPs it has satisfac-
tion-precedence relationships. Two issues that are
central to the recognition problem are what information
the OCP can utilize in effecting the recognition and at
what point in the discourse that information becomes
available.
An adequate computational model of the recognition
process depends critically on an adequate theory of
intention and action; this, of course, is a large research
problem in itself and one not restricted to matters of
discourse. The need to use such a model for discourse,
however, adds certain constraints on the adequacy of any
theory or model. Pollack (1986) describes several prop-
erties such theories and models must possess if they are
to be adequate for supporting recognition of intention in
single-utterance queries; she shows how current Al plan-
ning models are inadequate and proposes an alternative
planning formalism. The need to enable recognition of
discourse-level intentions leads to yet another set of
requirements.
As will become clear in what follows, the information
available to the OCP comes from a variety of sources.
Each of these can typically provide partial information
about the DSPs and their relationships. These sources are
each partially constraining, but only in their ensemble do
they constrain in full. To the extent that more informa-
tion is furnished by any one source, commensurately less
is needed from the others. The overall processing model
must be one of constraint satisfaction that can operate on
partial information. It must allow for incrementally
constraining the range of possibilities on the basis of new
information that becomes available as the segment
progresses.

4.1.1 INFORMATION CONSTRAINING THE DSP
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998821142857143">
At least three different kinds of information play a role in
the determination of the DSP: specific linguistic markers,
utterance-level intentions, and general knowledge about
actions and objects in the domain of discourse. Each
plays a part in the OCP&apos;s recognition of the DSP and can
be utilized by the ICP to facilitate this recognition.
Cue phrases are the most distinguished linguistic
means that speakers have for indicating discourse
segment boundaries and conveying information about the
DSP. Recent evidence by Hirschberg and Pierrehumbert
(1986) suggests that certain intonational properties of
utterances also provide partial information about the DSP
relationships. Because some cue phrases may be used as
clausal connectors, there is a need to distinguish their
discourse use from their use in conveying propositional
content at the utterance level. For example, the word but
functions as a boundary marker in utterance (7) of the
discourse in Section 3.1, but it can also be used solely (as
in the current utterance) to convey propositional content
(e.g., the conjunction of two propositions) and serve to
connect two clauses within a segment.

</note>
<bodyText confidence="0.9995194">
As discussed in Section 6, cue phrases can provide
information about dominance and satisfaction-prece-
dence relationships between segments&apos; DSPs. However,
they may not completely specify which DSP dominates or
satisfaction-precedes the DSP of the segment they start.
Furthermore, cue phrases that explicitly convey informa-
tion only about the attentional structure (see Section 6)
may be ambiguous about the state to which attention is
to shift. For example, if there have been several inter-
ruptions (see Section 5), the phrase but anyway indicates
a return to some previously interrupted discourse, but
does not specify which one. Although cue phrases do not
completely specify a DSP, the information they provide is
useful in limiting the options to be considered.
The second kind of information the OCP has available
is the utterance-level intention of each utterance in the
discourse. As the discussion of the movies example
(Section 3.1) pointed out, the DSP may be identical to
the utterance-level intention of some utterance in the
segment. Alternatively, the DSP may combine the
intentions of several utterances, as is illustrated in the
following discourse segment:
I want you to arrange a trip for me to Palo Alto.
It will be for two weeks.
I only fly on TWA.
The DSP for this segment is, roughly, that the ICP
intends for the OCP to make (complete) trip arrange-
ments for the ICP to go to Palo Alto for two weeks,
under the constraint that any flights be on TWA. The
Gricean intentions for these three utterances are as
follows:
Utterance I: ICP intends that OCP believe that ICP
intends that OCP intend to make trip plans
for ICP to go to Palo Alto
Utterance2: ICP intends that OCP believe that ICP
intends OCP to believe that the trip will last
two weeks
Utterance3: ICP intends that OCP believe that ICP
intends OCP to believe that ICP flies only on
TWA
These intentions must be combined in some way to
produce the DSP. The process is quite complex, since the
OCP must recognize that the reason for utterances 2 and
3 is not simply to have some new beliefs about the ICP,
but to use those beliefs in arranging the trip. While this
example fits the schema of a request followed by two
informings, schemata will not suffice to represent the
behavior as a general rule. A different sequence of utter-
ances with different utterance-level intentions can have
the same DSP; this is the case in the following segment:

<listItem confidence="0.488236">

tion of the trip plans. For example, in the following
sequence the third utterance results in changing the way
the arrangements are made, rather than constraining the
nature of the arrangements themselves.
I want you to arrange a two-week trip for me to Palo
Alto. I fly only on TWA. The rates go up tomorrow,
so you&apos;ll want to call today.
Not only is the contribution of utterance-level
intentions to DSPs complicated, but in some instances the
DSP for a segment may both constrain and be partially
determined by the Gricean intention for some utterance
in the segment. For example, the Gricean-intention for
utterance (15) in the movies example (Section 3.1) is
derived from a combination of facts about the utterance
itself, and from its place in the discourse. On the surface,
(15) appears to be a question addressed to the OCP; its
intention would be roughly that the ICP intends the OCP
to believe that the ICP wants to know how young people,
etc. But (15) is actually a rhetorical question and has a
very different intention associated with it — namely, that
the ICP intends the OCP to believe proposition P2
(namely, that young people cannot drink in through their
eyes a continuous spectacle of intense and strained activ-
ity without harniful effects). In this example, this partic-
ular intention is also the primary component of the DSP.
The third kind of information that plays a role in
determining the DP/DSPs is shared knowledge about
actions and objects in the domain of discourse. This
shared knowledge is especially important when the
linguistic markers and utterance-level intentions are
insufficient for determining the DSP precisely.
In Section 7 we introduce two relations, a supports
relation between propositions and a generates relation
between actions, and present two rules stating equiv-
alences; one links a dominance relation between two
DSPs with a supports relation between propositions and
the other links a dominance relation between DSPs to a
generates relation between actions. Use of these rules in
one direction allows for (partially) determining what
supports or generates relationship holds from the domi-
nance relationship. But the rules can be used in the oppo-
site direction also: if, from the content of utterances and
reasoning about the domain of discourse, a supports or
generates relationship can be determined, then the domi-
nates relationship between DSPs can be determined. In
such cases it is important to derive the dominance
relationship so that the appropriate intentional and atten-
tional structures are available for processing or determin-
ing the interpretation of the subsequent discourse.
From the perspective of recognition, a trade-off
implicit in the two equivalences is important. If the ICP
makes the dominance relationship between two DSPs
explicit (e.g., with cue phrases), then the OCP can use
this information to help recognize the (ICP&apos;s beliefs
about the) supports relationship. Conversely, if the ICP&apos;s
utterances make clear the (ICP&apos;s beliefs about the)
supports or generates relationship, then the OCP can use

this information to help recognize the dominance
relationship. Although it is most helpful to use the domi-
nance relationships to constrain the search for appropri-
ate supports and generates relationships, sometimes these
latter relationships can be inferred reasonably directly
from the utterances in a• segment using general know-
ledge about the objects and actions in the domain of
discourse. It remains an open question what inferences
are needed and how complex it will be to compute
supports and generates relationships if the dominance
relationship is not directly indicated in a discourse.
Utterances from the movies essay illustrate this trade-
off. In utterance (9), the phrase in the first place
expresses the dominance relationship between DSPs of
the new segment DS5 and the parent segment DS4 direct-
ly. Because of the dominance relationship (as well as the
intentions expressed in the utterances), the OCP can
determine that the ICP believes that the proposition that
the content of the plays is not the best provides support
for the proposition that the result of indiscriminate movie
going is harmful. Hence determining dominance yields
the support relation. The support relation can also yield
dominance. Utterances (12)-(14), which comprise DS7,
are not explicitly marked for a dominance relation. It can
be inferred from the fact that the propositions in
(12)-(14) provide support for the proposition embedded
in DSP6 (that is, that the stories in movies are exciting
and over-emotional) that DSP6 dominates DSP7.
Finally, the more information an ICP supplies explicit-
ly in the actual utterances of a discourse, the less reason-
ing about domain information an OCP has to do to
achieve recognition. Cohen (1983) has made a similar
claim regarding the problem of recognizing the relation-
ship between one proposition and another.

<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.936629">
4.1.2 WHEN IS THE INTENTION RECOGNIZED?
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999973197183099">
As discussed in Section 2.2, the intentional structure
evolves as the discourse does. By the same token, the
discourse participants&apos; mental-state correlates of the
intentional structure are not prebuilt; neither participant
may have a complete model of the intentional structure
&amp;quot;in mind&amp;quot; until the discourse is completed. The domi-
nance relationships that actually shape the intentional
structure cannot be known a priori, because the specific
intentions that will come into play are not known (never
by the OCP, hardly ever by the ICP) until the utterances
in the discourse have been made. Although it is assumed
that the participants&apos; common knowledge includes&amp;quot;
enough information about the domain to determine vari-
ous relationships such as supports and generates, it is not
assumed that, prior to a discourse, they actually had
inferred and are aware of all the relationships they will
need for that discourse.
Because any of the utterances in a segment may
contribute information relevant to a complete determi-
nation of the DSP, the recognition process is not
complete until the end of the segment. However, the OCP
must be able to recognize at least a generalization of the
DSP so that he can make the proper moves with respect
to the attentional structure. That is, some combination of
explicit indicators and intentional and propositional
content must allow the OCP to ascertain where the DSP
will fit in the intentional structure at the beginning of a
segment, even if the specific intention that is the DSP
cannot be determined until the end of the segment.
Utterance (15) in the movies example illustrates this
point. The author writes, &amp;quot;How can our young people
drink in through their eyes a continuous spectacle of
intense and strained activity and feeling without harmful
effects?&amp;quot; The primary intention 12 is derived from this
utterance, but this cannot be done until very late in the
discourse segment [since (15) occurs at the end of DS2].
Furthermore, the segment for which 12 is primary has
complex embedding of other segments. Utterance (16),
intention IO, and DSO constitute another example of the
expression of a primary intention late in a discourse
segment. In that case, 10 cannot be computed until (16)
has been read, and (16) is not only the last utterance in
DSO, but is one that covers the entire essay. If an OCP
must recognize a DSP to understand a segment, then we
ask: how does the OCP recognize a DSP when the utter-
ance from which its primary intention is derived comes so
late in the segment?
We conjecture with regard to such segments as D2 of
the movies essay that the primary intention (e.g., 12) may
be determined partially (and hence a generalized version
become recognizable) before the point at which it is
actually expressed in the discourse. While the DP/DSP
may not be expressed early, there is still partial informa-
tion about it. This partial information often suffices to
establish dominance (or satisfaction-precedence)
relationships for additional segments. As these latter are
placed in the hierarchy, their DSPs can provide further
partial information for the underspecified DSP. For
example, even though the intention 10 is expressed
directly only in the last utterance of the movies essay,
utterance (4) expresses an intention to know whether p
or —p is true (i.e., whether or not parents should let chil-
dren see movies often and without close monitoring). 10
is an intention to believe, whose proposition is a gener-
alization of the —p expressed in (4). Consider also the
primary intention 14. It occurs in a segment embedded
within DS2, is more general than 12, but is an approxi-
mation to it. It would not be surprising to discover that
OCPs can in fact predict something close to 12 on the
basis of 14, utterances (9)-(14), and the partial domi-
nance hierarchy available at each point in the discourse.

4.2 USE OF THE ATTENTIONAL STATE MODEL

The focus space structure enables certain processing
decisions to be made locally. In particular, it limits the
information that must be considered in recognizing the
DSP as well as that considered in identifying the referents

A primary role of the focus space stack is to constrain
the range of DSPs considered as candidates for domi-
nation or satisfaction-precedence of the DSP of the
current segment. Only those DSPs in some space on the
focusing stack are viable prospects. As a result of this
use of the focusing structure, the theory predicts that this
decision will be a local one with respect to attentional
state. Because two focus spaces may be close to each
other in the attentional structure without the discourse
segments they arise from necessarily being close to one
another and vice versa, this prediction corresponds to a
claim that locality in the focusing structure is what
matters to determination of the intentional structure.
A second role of the focusing structure is to constrain
the OCP&apos;s search for possible referents of definite noun
phrases and pronouns. To illustrate this role, we will
consider the phrase the screw in the center in utterance
(25) of the task-oriented dialogue of Section 3. The
focus stack configuration when utterance (25) is spoken
is shown in Figure 7. The stack contains (in bottom-to-
top order) focus spaces FS1, FS4, and FS5 for segments
DS1, DS4, and DS5, respectively. For DS5 the wheelpul-
ler is a focused entity, while for D54 the two setscrews
are (because they are explicitly mentioned). The entities
in FS5 are considered before those in FS4 as potential
referents. The wheelpuller has three screws: two small
screws fasten the side arms, and a large screw in the
center is the main functioning part. As a result, this large
screw is implicitly in focus in FS5 (Grosz 1977) and thus
identified as the referent without the two setscrews ever
being considered.
Attentional state also constrains the search for refer-
ents of pronouns. Because pronouns contain less explicit
information about their referents than definite
descriptions, additional mechanisms are needed to
account for what may and may not be pronominalized in
the discourse. One such mechanism is centering (which
we previously called immediate focusing; Grosz, Joshi,
and Weinstein 1983; Sidner 1979).
Centering, like focusing, is a dynamic behavior, but is
a more local phenomenon. In brief, a backward-looking
center is associated with each utterance in a discourse
segment; of all the focused elements the backward-look-
ing center is the one that is central in that utterance (i.e.,
the uttering of the particular sequence of words at that
point in the discourse). A combination of syntactic,
semantic, and discourse information is used to identify
the backward-looking center. The fact that some entity is
the backward-looking center is used to constrain the
search for the referent of a pronoun in a subsequent
utterance. Note that unlike the DSP, which is constant
for a segment, the backward-looking center may shift:
different entities may become more salient at different
points in the segment.
The presence of both centers and DSPs in this theory
leads us to an intriguing conjecture: that &amp;quot;topic&amp;quot; is a
concept that is used ambiguously for both the DSP of a
segment and the center. In the literature the concept of
&amp;quot;topic&amp;quot; has appeared in many guises. In syntactic form it
is used to describe the preposing of syntactic constituents
in English and the &amp;quot;wa&amp;quot; marking in Japanese. Research-
ers have used it to describe the sentence topic (i.e., what
the sentence is about; Firbas 1971, Sgall, Haji6ova, and

5 APPLICATION OF THE THEORY: INTERRUPTIONS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999991942857143">
Interruptions in discourses pose an important test of any
theory of discourse structure. Because processing an
utterance requires ascertaining how it fits with previous
discourse, it is crucial to decide which parts of the previ-
ous discourse are relevant to it, and which cannot be.
Interruptions, by definition, do not fit; consequently their
treatment has implications for the treatment of the
normal flow of discourse. Interruptions may take many
forms — some are not at all relevant to the content and
flow of the interrupted discourse, others are quite rele-
vant, and many fall somewhere in between these
extremes. A theory must differentiate these cases and
explain (among other things) what connections exist
between the main discourse and the interruption, and
how the relationship between them affects the processing
of the utterances in both.
The importance of distinguishing between intentional
structure and attentional state is evident in the three
examples considered in Subsections 5.2, 5.3, and 5.4.
The distinction also permits us to explain a type of
behavior deemed by others to be similar — so-called
semantic returns — an issue we examine in Subsection
5.5.
These examples do not exhaust the types of inter-
ruptions that can occur in discourse. There are other
ways to vary the explicit linguistic (and nonlinguistic)
indicators used to indicate boundaries, the relationships
between DSPs, and the combinations of focus space
relationships present. However, the examples provide
illustrations of interruptions at different points along the
spectrum of relevancy to the main discourse. Because
they can be explained more adequately by the theory of
discourse structure presented here than by previous theo-
ries, they support the importance of the distinctions we
have drawn.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.93325">
5.1 PRELIMINARY DEFINITIONS
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.990348274509804">
From an intuitive view, we observe that interruptions are
pieces of discourse that break the flow of the preceding
discourse. An interruption is in some way distinct from
the rest of the preceding discourse; after the break for
the interruption, the discourse returns to the interrupted
piece of discourse. In the example below, from Polanyi
and Scha (forthcoming), there are two (separate)
discourses, D1 indicated in normal type, and D2 in italics.
D2 is an interruption that breaks the flow of D1 and is
distinct from Dl.
Dl: John came by
and left the groceries
D2: Stop that
you kids
Dl: and I put them away
after he left
Using the theory described in previous sections, we
can capture the above intuitions about the nature of
interruptions with two slightly different definitions. The
strong definition holds for those interruptions we classify
as &amp;quot;true interruptions&amp;quot; and digressions, while the weaker
form holds for those that are flashbacks. The two defi-
nitions are as follows:
Strong definition: An interruption is a discourse
segment whose DSP is not dominated nor satisfac-
tion-preceded by the DSP of any preceding segment.
Weak definition: An interruption is a discourse
segment whose DSP is not dominated nor satisfac-
tion-preceded by the DSP of the immediately preced-
ing segment.
Neither of the above definitions includes an explicit
mention of our intuition that there is a &amp;quot;return&amp;quot; to the
interrupted discourse after an interruption. The return is
an effect of the normal progress of a conversation. If we
assume a focus space is normally popped from the focus
stack if and only if a speaker has satisfied the DSP of its
corresponding segment, then it naturally follows both
that the focus space for the interruption will be popped
after the interruption, and that the focus space for the
interrupted segment will be at the top of the stack
because its DSP is yet to be satisfied.
There are other kinds of discourse segments that one
may want to consider in light of the interruption contin-
uum and these definitions. Clarification dialogues (Allen
1979) and debugging explanations (Sidner 1983) are two
such possibilities. Both of them, unlike the interruptions
discussed here, share a DSP with their preceding segment
and thus do not conform to our definition of interruption.
These kinds of discourses may constitute another general
class of discourse segments that, like interruptions, can
be abstractly defined.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997968">
5.2 TYPE 1: TRUE INTERRUPTIONS
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999507818181818">
The first kind of interruption is the true interruption,
which follows the strong definition of interruptions. It is
exemplified by the interruption given in the previous
subsection. Discourses D1 and D2 have distinct, unre-
lated purposes and convey different information about
properties, objects, and relations. Since D2 occurs within

man-Adar 1984) because the &amp;quot;embedding&amp;quot; occurs only in
the attentional structure. As shown in Figure 8, the
focus space for D2 is pushed onto the stack above the
focus space for D1, so that the focus space for D2 is
more salient than the one for D1, until D2 is completed.
The intentional structures for the two segments are
distinct. There are two DP/DSP structures for the utter-
ances in this sequence — one for those in D1 and the
other for those in D2. It is not necessary to relate these
two; indeed, from an intuitive point of view, they are not
related.
The focusing structure for true interruptions is differ-
ent from that for the normal embedding of segments,
because the focusing boundary between the interrupted
discourse and the interruption is impenetrable.12 (This is
depicted in the figure by a line with intersecting hash
marks between focus spaces). The impenetrable bounda-
ry between the focus spaces prevents entities in the spac-
es below the boundary from being available to the spaces
above it. Because the second discourse shifts attention
totally to a new purpose (and may also shift the identity
of the intended hearers), the speaker cannot use any

referential expressions during it that depend on the
accessibility of entities from the first discourse. Since the
boundary between the focus space for D1 and the one
for D2 is impenetrable, if D2 were to include an utter-
ance such as put them away, the pronoun would have to
refer deictically, and not anaphorically, to the groceries.
In this sample discourse, however, D1 is resumed
almost immediately. The pronoun them in and I put them
away cannot refer to the children (the focus space for D2
has been popped from the stack), but only to the
groceries. For this to be clear to the OCP, the ICP must
indicate a return to D1 explicitly. One linguistic indicator
in this example is the change of mood from imperative.
Indicators that the stop that utterance is an interruption
include the change to imperative mood and the use of the
vocative (Polanyi and Scha 1983). Two other indicators
may be assumed to have been present at the time of the
discourse — a change of intonation (imagine a slightly
shrill tone of command with an undercurrent of annoy-
ance) and a shift of gaze (toward and then away from
the kids). It is also possible that the type of pause pres-
ent in such cases is evidence of the interruption, but
further research is needed to establish whether this is
indeed the case.
In contrast to previous accounts, we are not forced to
integrate these two discourses into a single grammatical
structure, or to answer questions about the specific
relationship between segments D2 and D1, as in
Reichman&apos;s model (Reichman-Adar 1984). Instead, the
intuition that readers have of an embedding in the
discourse structure is captured in the attentional state by
the stacking of focus spaces. In addition, a reader&apos;s intui-
tive impression of the distinctness of the two segments is
captured in their different intentional (DP/DSP) struc-
tures.

5.3 TYPE 2: FLASHBACKS AND FILLING IN MISSING PLACES
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994237391304348">
Sometimes an ICP interrupts the flow of discussion
because some purposes, propositions, or objects need to
be brought into the discourse but have not been: the ICP
forgot to include those entities first, and so must now go
back and fill in the missing information. A flashback
segment occurs at that point in the discourse. The flash-
back is defined as a segment whose DSP satisfaction-pre-
cedes the interrupted segment and is dominated by some
other segment&apos;s DSP. Hence, it is a specialization of the
weak definition of interruptions. This type of inter-
ruption differs from true interruptions both intentionally
and linguistically: the DSP for the flashback bears some
relationship to the DP for the whole discourse. The
linguistic indicator of the flashback typically includes a
comment about something going wrong. In addition the
audience always remains the same, whereas it may
change for a true interruption (as in the example of the
previous section).
In the example below, taken from Sidner (1982), the
1CP is instructing a mock-up system (mimicked by a
person) about how to define and display certain informa-
tion in a particular knowledge-representation language.
Again the interruption is indicated by italics.
OK. Now how do I say that Bill is
Whoops I forgot about ABC.
I need an individual concept for the company ABC
..lremainder of discourse segment on ABC]...
Now back to Bill. How do I say that Bill is an employee
of ABC?
The DP for the larger discourse from which this
sequence was taken is to provide information about vari-
ous companies (including ABC) and their employees.
The outer segment in this example —DBII1 — has a DSP —
DSPBill — to tell about Bill, while the inner segment —
DAB C — has a DSP DSPABc — to convey certain infor-
mation about ABC. Because of the nature of the infor-
mation being told, there is order in the final structure of
the DP/DSPs: information about ABC must be conveyed
before all of the information about Bill can be. The ICP
in this instance does not realize this constraint until after
he begins. The &amp;quot;flashback&amp;quot; interruption allows him to
satisfy DSPABc while suspending satisfaction of DSPBB1
(which he then resumes). Hence, there is an intentional
structure rooted at DP and with DSPABc and DSPBill as
ordered sister nodes. The following three relationships
hold between the different DSPs:14

This kind of interruption is distinct from a true inter-
ruption because there is a connection, although indirect,
between the DSPs for the two segments. Furthermore,
the linguistic features of the start of the interruption
signify that there is a precedence relation between these
DSPs (and hence that the correction is necessary). Flash-
backs are also distinct from normally embedded
discourses because of the precedence relationship
between the DSPs for the two segments and the order in
which the segments occur.
The available linguistic data permit three possible
attentional states as appropriate models for flashback-
type interruptions: one is identical to the state that would
ensue if the flashback segment were a normally embed-
ded segment, the second resembles the model of a true
interruption, and the third differs from the others by
requiring an auxiliary stack. An example of the stack for
a normally embedded sequence is given in Section 4.2
Figure 9 illustrates the last possibility. The focus space
for the flashback — FSABc — is pushed onto the stack
after an appropriate number of spaces, including the
focus space for the outer segment — FSBill, have been
popped from the main stack and pushed onto an auxiliary
stack. All of the entities in the focus spaces remaining on
the main stack are normally accessible for reference, but
none of those on the auxiliary stack are. In the example
in the figure, entities in the spaces from FSA to FSB are
accessible as well (though less salient than) those in

space FSABc. Evidence for this kind of stack behavior
could come from discourses in which phrases in the
segment about ABC could refer to entities represented in
FSB, but not to those in FSBill or FSc. After an explicit
indication that there is a return to DSPBili (e.g., the Now
back to Bill used in this example), any focus spaces left
on the stack from the flashback are popped off, and all
spaces on the auxiliary stack (including FSBill) are
returned to the main stack. Note, however, that this
model does not preclude the possibility of a return to
some space between FSA and FSB before popping the
auxiliary stack. Whether there are discourses that include
such a return and are deemed coherent is an open ques-
tion.
The auxiliary stack model differs from the other two
models by the references permitted and by the spaces
that can be popped to. Given the initial configuration in
Figure 9, if the segment with DSPABc were normally
embedded, FSABc would just be added to the top of the
stack. If it were a true interruption, the space would also
&apos;be added to the stack, but with an impenetrable bounda-
ry between it and FSBili. In the normal stack model, enti-
ties in the spaces lower in the stack would be accessible;
in the true interruption they would not. In either of these
two models, however, FSBill would be the space returned
to first. The auxiliary stack model is obviously more
complicated than the other two alternatives. Whether it
(or some equivalent alternative) is necessary depends on
facts of discourse behavior that have not yet been deter-
mined.

5.4 TYPE 3: DIGRESSIONS
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99703365">
The third type of interruption, which we call a digression,
is defined as a strong interruption that contains a refer-
ence to some entity that is salient in both the interruption
and the interrupted segment. For example, if while
discussing Bill&apos;s role in company ABC, one conversational
participant interrupts with, Speaking of Bill, that reminds
me, he came to dinner last week, Bill remains salient, but
the DP changes. Digressions commonly begin with
phrases such as speaking of John or that reminds me,
although no cue phrase need be present, and that reminds
me may also signal other stack and intention shifts.
In the processing of digressions, the discourse-level
intention of the digression forms the base of a separate
intentional structure, just as in the case of true inter-
ruptions. A new focus space is formed and pushed onto
the stack, but it contains at least one — and possibly other
— entities from the interrupted segment&apos;s focus space.
Like the flashback-type interruption, the digression must
usually be closed with an explicit utterance such as
getting back to ABC... or anyway.

5.5 NONINTERRUPTIONS - &amp;quot;SEMANTIC RETURNS&amp;quot;
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999931222222222">
One case of discourse behavior that we must distinguish
comprises the so-called &amp;quot;semantic returns&amp;quot; observed by
Reichman (1981) and discussed by Polanyi and Scha
(1983). In all the interruptions we have considered so
far, the stack must be popped when the interruption is
over and the interrupted discourse is resumed. The focus
space for the interrupted segment is &amp;quot;returned to.&amp;quot; In the
case of semantic returns, entities and DSPs that were sali-
ent during a discourse in the past are taken up once
again, but are explicitly reintroduced. For example,
suppose that yesterday two people discussed how badly
Jack was behaving at the party; then today one of them
says Remember our discussion about Jack at the party?
Well, a lot of other people thought he acted just as badly as
we thought he did. The utterances today recall, or return
to, yesterday&apos;s conversation to help satisfy the intention
that more be said about Jack&apos;s poor behavior.
Anything that can be talked about once can be talked
about again. However, if there is no focus space on the
stack corresponding to the segment and DSP being
discussed further, then, as Polanyi and Scha (1983) point
out, there is no popping of the stack. There need not be
any discourse underway when a semantic return occurs;
in such cases, the focus stack will be empty. Thus, unlike
the returns that follow normal interruptions, semantic
returns involve a push onto the stack of a new space
containing, among other things, representations of the
reintroduced entities.
The separation of attentional state from intentional
structure makes clear not only what is occurring in such
cases, but also the intuitions underlying the term seman-
tic return. In reintroducing some entities from a previous
discourse, conversational participants are establishing
some connection between the DSP of the new segment
and the intentional structure of the original discourse. It
is not a return to a previous focus space because the
focus space for the original discourse is gone from the
stack, and the items to be referred to must be re-establ-
ished explicitly. For example, the initial reference to
Jack in the preceding example cannot be accomplished
with a pronoun; with no prior mention of Jack in the
current discussion, one cannot say, Remember our
discussion about him at the party. The intuitive
impression of a return in the strict sense is only a return
to a previous intentional structure.

6 APPLICATION OF THE THEORY: CUE WORDS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999561071428572">
Both attentional state and intentional structure change
during a discourse. ICPs rarely change attention by
directly and explicitly referring to attentional state (e.g.,
using the phrase Now let&apos;s turn our attention to...). Like-
wise, discourses only occasionally include an explicit
reference to a change in purpose (e.g., with an utterance
such as Now I want to explain the theory of dynamic
programming). More typically, ICPs employ indirect
means of indicating that a change is coming and what
kind of change it is. Cue phrases provide abbreviated,
indirect means of indicating these changes.
In all discourse changes, the ICP must provide infor-
mation that allows the OCP to determine all of the
following:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.998898666666667">
1. that a change of attention is imminent;
2. whether the change returns to a previous focus space
or creates a new one;
3. how the intention is related to other intentions;
4. what precedence relationships, if any, are relevant;
5. what intention is entering into focus.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999220111111111">
Cue phrases can pack in all of this information, except
for (5). In this section, we explore the predictions of our
discourse structure theory about different uses of these
phrases and the explanations the theory offers for their
various roles.
We use the configuration of attentional state and
intentional structure illustrated in Figure 10 as the start-
ing point of our analysis. In the initial configuration, the
focus space stack has a space with DSP X at the bottom
and another space with DSP A at the top. The intentional
structure includes the information that X dominates A.
From this initial configuration, a wide variety of moves
may be made. We examine several changes and the cue
phrases that can indicate each of them. Because these
phrases and words in isolation may ambiguously play
either discourse or other functional roles, we also discuss
the other uses whenever appropriate. Furthermore, cue
phrases do not function unambiguously with respect to a
particular discourse role. Thus for example, first can be
used for two different moves that we discuss below.
First, consider what happens when the ICP shifts to a
new DSP, B, that is dominated by A (and corresponding-
ly by X). The dominance relationship between A and B
becomes part of the intentional structure. In addition,
the change in DSP results in a change in the focus stack.
The focus stack models this change, which we call new
dominance, by a having new space pushed onto the stack
with B as the DSP of that space (as illustrated in Figure
11). The space containing A is salient, but less so than
the space with B. Cue phrase(s) to signal this case, and
only this one, must communicate two pieces of informa-
tion: that there is a change to some new purpose (result-
ing in a new focus space being created in the attentional
state model rather than a return to one on the stack) and
that the new purpose (DSP B) is dominated by DSP A.
Typical cue phrases for this kind of change are for exam-
ple and to wit, and sometimes first and second.
Cue phrases can also exhibit the existence of a satis-
faction-precedence relationship. If B is to be the first in
a list of DSPs dominated by A, then words such as first
and in the first place can be used to communicate this
fact. Later in the discourse, cue phrases such as second,
third, and finally can be used to indicate DSPs that are
dominated by A and satisfaction-preceded by B. In these
cases, the focus space containing B would be popped

from the stack and the new focus space inserted above
the one containing A.
There are three other kinds of discourse segments that
change the intentional structure with a resulting push of
new focus spaces onto the stack: the true-interruption,
where B is not dominated by A; the flashback, where B
satisfaction-precedes A; and the digression, where B is
not dominated by A, but some entity from the focus
space containing A is carried over to the new focus
space.
One would expect that there might be cue phrases that
would distinguish among all four of these kinds of chang-
es. Just that is so. There are cue phrases that announce
one and only one kind of change. The cue phrases
mentioned above for new dominance are never used for
the three kinds of discourse interruption pushes. The cue
phrases for true-interruptions express the intention to
interrupt (e.g. Excuse me a minute, or I must interrupt)
while the distinct cue phrase for flashbacks (e.g. Oops, I
forgot about ...) indicates that something is out of order.
The typical opening cue phrases of the digression
mention the entity that is being carried forward (e.g.
Speaking of John ... or Did you hear about John?).

Cue phrases can also exhibit the satisfaction of a DSP,
and hence the completion of a discourse segment. The
completion of a segment causes the current space to be
popped from the stack. There are many means of
linguistically marking completions. In texts, paragraph
and chapter boundaries and explicit comments (e.g. The
End) are common In conversations, completion can be
indicated either with cue phrases such as fine or OK15 or
with more explicit references to the satisfaction of the
intention (e.g., That&apos;s all for point 2, or The ayes have it.).
Most cue phrases that communicate changes to atten-
tional state announce pops of the focus stack. However,
at least one cue phrase can be construed to indicate a
push, namely, That reminds me. By itself, this phrase does
not specify any particular change in intentional structure,
but merely shows that there will be a new DSP. Since
this is equivalent to indicating that a new focus space is
to be pushed onto the stack, this cue phrase is best seen
as conveying attentional information.
Cue phrases that indicate pops to some other space
back in the stack include but anyway, anyway, in any case,
and now back to... When the current focus space is
popped from the stack, a space already on the stack
becomes most salient. From the configuration in Figure
10, the space with A is popped from the stack, perhaps
with others, and another space on the stack becomes the
top of the stack. Popping back changes the stack without
creating a new DSP, or a dominance or satisfaction-
precedence relationship. The pop entails a return to an
old DSP; no change is effected in the intentional struc-
ture.
There are cue phrases, such as now and next, that
signal a change of attentional state, but do not distinguish
between the creation of a new focus space and the return
to an old one. These words can be used for either move.
For example, in a task-oriented discourse during which
some task has been mentioned but put aside to ask a
question, the use of now indicates a change of focus. The
utterance following now, however, will either return the
discussion to the deferred task or will introduce some
new task for consideration.
Note, finally, that a pop of the focus stack may be
achieved without the use of cue phrases as in the follow-
ing fragment of a task-oriented dialogue (Grosz 1974):
A: One bolt is stuck. I&apos;m trying to use both the pliers and
the wrench to get it unstuck, but I haven&apos;t had much
luck.
E: Don&apos;t use pliers. Show me what you are doing.
A: I&apos;m pointing at the bolts.
E: Show me the 1/2&amp;quot; combination wrench, please.
A: OK.
E: Good, now show me the 1/2&amp;quot; box wrench.
A: I already got it loosened.
The last utterance in this fragment returns the
discourse to the discussion of the unstuck bolt. The pop
can be inferred only from the content of the main portion
of the utterance. The pronoun (or, more accurately, the
fact that it cannot be referring to the wrench) is a cue
that a pop is needed, but only the reference to the loos-
ening action allows the OCP to recognize to which
discourse segment this utterance belongs, as discussed by
Sidner (1979) and Robinson (1981). A summary of the
uses of cue phrases is given in Figure 12.

The cases listed here do not exhaust the changes in
focus spaces and in the dominance hierarchy that can be
represented — nor have we furnished a set of rules that
specify when cue phrases are necessary. Additional
cases, especially special subcases of these, may be possi-
ble. When discourse is viewed in terms of intentional
structure and attentional state, it is clearer just what
kinds of information linguistic expressions and intonation
convey to the hearer about the discourse structure.
Furthermore, it is clear that linguistic expressions can
function as cue phrases, as well as sentential connections;
they can tell the hearer about changes in the discourse
structure and be carriers of discourse, rather than
sentence-level semantic, meaning.

7 SOME PROPERTIES AND PROBLEMS OF
DISCOURSE-LEVEL INTENTIONS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998385">
The intentions that serve as DP/DSPs are natural exten-
sions of the intentions Grice (1969) considers essential
to developing a theory of utterer&apos;s meaning. There is a
crucial difference, however, between our use of disc-
ourse-level intentions in this paper (and the theory, as
developed so far) and Grice&apos;s use of utterance-level
intentions. We are not yet addressing the issue of
discourse meaning, but are concerned with the role of
DP/DSPs in determining discourse structure and in speci-
fying how these intentions can be recognized by an OCP.
Although the intentional structure of a discourse plays a
role in determining discourse meaning, the DP/DSPs do
not in and of themselves constitute discourse segment
meaning. The connection between intentional structure
and discourse meaning is similar to that between atten-
tional and cognitive states; the attentional state plays a
role in a hearer&apos;s understanding of what the speaker
means by a given sequence of utterances in a discourse
segment, but it is not the only aspect of cognitive state
that contributes to this understanding.
We will draw upon some particulars of Grice&apos;s defi-
nition of utterer&apos;s meaning to explain DSPs more fully.
His initial definition is as follows:
U meant something by uttering x is true if f [for
some audience A]:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.888113333333333">
1. U intended, by uttering x, to induce a certain
response in A
2. U intended A to recognize, at least in part from
the utterance of x, that U intended to produce

mentioned in (2) to be at least in part A&apos;s
reason for fulfilling the intention mentioned in
(1).

Grice takes *,,typ to be the meaning of the utterance,
where *1p is a mood indicator associated with the proposi-
tional attitude 1p (e.g., *1,G= assert and tP=believe). He
considers attitudes like believing that ICP is a German
soldier and intending to give the ICP a beer as examples
of the kinds of m-ing that p that utterance intentions can
embed. For expository purposes, we use the following
notation to represent these utterance-level intentions:
Intend(ICP, Believe(OCP, ICP is a German soldier))
Intend(ICP, Intend(OCP, OCP give ICP a beer))
To extend Grice&apos;s definition to discourses, we replace
the utterance x with a discourse segment DS, the utterer
U with the initiator of a discourse segment ICP, and the
audience A with the OCP. To complete this extension,
the following problems must be resolved:

1. specifying the discourse-level intentions and attitudes

2. identifying the kinds of fs that contribute to deter-
mining discourse-level intentions;
3. identifying the modes of correlation (the c&apos;s) between
features of the discourse segments and types of disc-
ourse-level intentions;

Although each of these issues is an unresolved prob-
lem in discourse theory, this paper has provided partial
answers. The examples presented illustrate the range of
discourse-level intentions; these intentions appear to be
similar to utterance-level intentions in kind, but differ in
that they occur in a context in which several utterances
may be required to ensure their comprehension and satis-
faction. The features so far identified as conveying
information about DSPs are: specific linguistic markers
(e.g., cue phrases, intonation), utterance-level intentions,
and propositional content of the utterances. We have not
explored the problem of identifying modes of correlation
in any detail, but it is clear that those modes that operate
at the utterance level also function at the discourse level.
As discussed previously, the proper treatment of the
recognition of discourse-level intentions is especially
necessary for a computationally useful account of
discourse. At the discourse level, just as at the utterance
level, the intended recognition of intentions plays a

central role. The DSPs are intended to be recognized:
they achieve their effects, in part, because the OCP
recognizes the ICP&apos;s intention for the OCP to 4, that p.
The OCP&apos;s recognition of this intention is crucial to its
achieving the desired effect. In Section 4 we described
certain constraints on the recognition process.

7.1 THE BASIC GENERALIZATION
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999984102272727">
In extending Grice&apos;s analysis to the discourse level, we
have to consider not only individual beliefs and
intentions, but also the relationships among them that
arise because of the relationships among various
discourse segments (and utterances within a segment)
and the purposes the segments serve with respect to the
entire discourse. To clarify these relationships, consider
an analogous situation with nonlinguistic actions.18 An
action may divide into several subactions; for example,
the planting of a rose bush divides into preparing the soil,
digging a hole, placing the rose bush in the hole, filling
the rest of the hole with soil, and watering the ground
around the bush. The intention to perform the planting
action includes several subsidiary intentions (one for
each of the subactions — namely, to do it).
In discourse, in a manner that is analogous to nonlin-
guistic actions, the DP (and some DSPs) includes several
subsidiary intentions related to the DSPs it dominates.
For purposes of exposition, we will use the term primary
intention to distinguish the overall intention of the DP
from the subsidiary intentions of the DP. For example in
the movies argument of Section 3.1, the primary inten-
tion is for the reader to come to believe that parents and
teachers should keep children from seeing too many
movies; in the task dialogue of Section 3.2, the intention
is that the apprentice remove the flywheel. Subsidiary
intentions include, respectively, the intention that the
reader believe that it is important to evaluate movies and
the intention that the expert help the apprentice locate
the second setscrew.
Because the beliefs and intentions of at least two
different participants are involved in discourse, two prop-
erties of the general-action situation (assuming a single
agent performs all actions) do not carry over. First, in a
discourse, the ICP intends the OCP to recognize the ICP&apos;s
beliefs about the connections among various propositions
and actions. For example, in the movies argument, the
reader (OCP) is intended to recognize that the author
(ICP) believes some propositions provide support for
others; in the task dialogue the expert (ICP) intends the
apprentice (OCP) to recognize that the expert believes
the performance of certain actions contributes to the
performance of other actions. In contrast, in the gener-
al-action situation in which there is no communication,
there is no need for recognition of another agent&apos;s beliefs
about the interrelationship of various actions and
intentions.
The second difference concerns the extent to which
the subsidiary actions or intentions specify the overall
action or intention. To perform some action, the agent
must perform each of the subactions involved; by
performing all of these subactions the agent performs the
action. In contrast in a discourse, the participants share
the assumption of discourse sufficiency: it is a convention
of the communicative situation that the ICP believes the
discourse is sufficient to achieve the primary intention of
the DP. Discourse sufficiency does not entail logical
sufficiency or action completeness. It is not necessarily
the case that satisfaction of all of the DSPs is sufficient in
and of itself for satisfaction of the DP. Rather, there is an
assumption that the information conveyed in the
discourse will suffice in conjunction with other information
the ICP believes the OCP has (or can obtain) to allow for
satisfaction of the primary intention of the DP. Satisfac-
tion of all of the DSPs, in conjunction with this additional
information, is enough for satisfaction of the DP. Hence,
in discourse the intentional structure (the analogue of the
action hierarchy) need not be complete.
For example, the propositions expressed in the movies
essay do not provide a logically sufficient proof of the
claim. The author furnishes information he believes to be
adequate for the reader to reach the desired conclusion
and assumes the reader will supplement what is actually
said with appropriate additional information and reason-
ing. Likewise, the task dialogue does not mention all the
subtasks explicitly. Instead, the expert and apprentice
discuss explicitly only those subtasks for which some
instruction is needed or in connection with which some
problem arises.
To be more concrete, we shall look at the extension of
the Gricean analysis for two particular cases, one involv-
ing a belief, the other an intention to perform some
action. We shall consider only the simplest situations, in
which the primary intentions of the DP/DSPs are about
either beliefs or actions, but not a mixture. Although the
task dialogue obviously involves a mixture, this is an
extremely complicated issue that demands additional
research.

7.2 THE BELIEF CASE
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998654">
In the belief case, the primary intention of the DP is to
get the OCP to believe some proposition, say p. Each of
the discourse segments is also intended to get the OCP to
believe a proposition, say qi for some i=1,.. .,n (where
there are n discourse segments). In addition to the prima-
ry intention — i.e., that the OCP should come to believe p
— the DP includes an intention that the OCP come to
believe each of the qi and, in addition, an intention that
the OCP come to believe the qi provide support for p. We
can represent this schematically as:19

<bodyText confidence="0.849491">
Believe(OCP, Supports (p, qiA...Aq.)))
There are several things to note here. To begin with,
the first intention, (Intend ICP (Believe (OCP p)), is the
primary component of the DSP. Second, each of the

<bodyText confidence="0.979508566666667">
intended beliefs in the second conjunct corresponds to
the primary component of the DSP of some embedded
discourse segment. Third, the supports relation is not
implication. The OCP is not intended to believe that the
q; imply p, but rather to believe that the q, in conjunction
with other facts and rules that the ICP assumes the OCP
has available or can obtain and thus come to believe are
sufficient for the OCP to conclude p. Fourth, the
DP/DSP may only be completely determined at the end
of the discourse (segment), as we discussed in Section 4.
Finally, to determine how the discourse segments
corresponding to the q; are related to the one corre-
sponding to p, the OCP only has to believe that the ICP
believes a supports relationship holds. Hence, for the
purpose of recognizing the discourse structure, it would
be sufficient for the third clause to be
Believe(OCP, Believe(ICP,
Supports (p, q,A...Aqn)))
However, the DP of a belief-case discourse is not merely
to get the OCP to believe p, but to get the OCP to believe
p by virtue of believing the qi. That this is so can be seen
clearly by considering situations in which the OCP
already believes p and is known by the ICP to do so, but
does not have a good reason for believing p. This last
property of the belief case is not shared by the action
case.
There is an important relationship between the
supports relation and the dominance relation that can
hold between DP/DSPs; it is captured in the following
rule (using the same notation as above):
</bodyText>
<reference confidence="0.5142752">
Vi=1,...,n Intend(CP,, Believe(CP2,p)) A
Intend(CP,, Believe(CP2,q1)) A
Believe(CP,, Supports(p, q,A...Aqn))
DOM(Intend(CP,, Believe(CP2,p))
Intend(CP,, Believe(CP2,q1)))
</reference>
<bodyText confidence="0.999914545454545">
The implication in the forward direction states that if a
conversational participant (CPi) believes that the propo-
sition p is supported by the proposition qi, and he intends
another participant (CP2) to adopt these beliefs, then his
intention that CP2 believe p dominates his intention that
CP2 believe qi. Viewed intuitively, CPI&apos;s belief that q;
provides support for p, underlies his intention to get CP2
to believe p by getting him to believe qi. The satisfaction
of CP, &apos;s intention that CP2 should believe q; will help
satisfy CPI&apos;s intention that CP2 believe p. This relation-
ship plays a role in the recognition of DSPs.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.98513">
7.3 THE ACTION CASE
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99924225">
An analogous situation holds for a discourse segment
comprising utterances intended to get the OCP to
perform some set of actions directed at achieving some
overall task (e.g., some segments in the task-oriented
dialogue of Section 3.2). The full specification of the
DP/DSP contains a generates relation that is derived from
a relation defined by Goldman (1970). For this case, the
DP/DSPs are of the following form:
</bodyText>
<reference confidence="0.61543575">
Computational Linguistics, Volume 12, Number 3, July-September 1986
Vi=1,...,n Intend(ICP, Intend(OCP, Do(A)) A
Intend(OCP, Do(a;)) A
Believe(OCP, Believe(ICP,
</reference>
<bodyText confidence="0.984957935483871">
Generates(A, a.,A...Aan))))
Each intention to act represented in the second conjunct
corresponds to the primary intention of some discourse
segment.
Like supports, the generates relation is partial (its
partiality distinguishes it in part from Goldman&apos;s
relation), Thus, the OCP is not intended to believe that
the ICP believes that performance of a, alone is sufficient
for performance of A, but rather that doing all of the ai
and other actions that the OCP can be expected to know
or figure out constitutes a performance of A. In the task
dialogue of Section 3.2, many actions that are essential to
the task (e.g., the apprentice picking up the Allen wrench
and applying it correctly to the setscrews) are never even
mentioned in the dialogue.
Note that it is unnecessary for the ICP or OCP to have
a complete plan relating all of the ai to A at the start of
the discourse (or discourse segment). All that is required
is that, for any given segment, the OCP be able to deter-
mine what intention to act the segment corresponds to
and which other intentions dominate that intention.
Finally, unlike the belief case, the third conjunct here
requires only that the OCP recognize that the ICP
believes a generates relationship holds. The OCP can do
A by virtue of doing the ai without coming himself to
believe anything about the relationships between A and
the ai.
As in the belief case, there is an equivalence that links
the generates relation among actions to the dominance
relation between intentions. Schematically, it is as
follows:
</bodyText>
<reference confidence="0.837449">
Vi= 1,...,n Intend(CPi, Intend(CP2, Do(A))) A
Intend(CPi, Intend(CP2, Do(a;))) A
Believe(CP1, Generates(A, a,A...Aan))
DOM(Intend(CP,, Intend(CP2, Do(A)))
Intend(CP1, Intend(CP2, Do(a;))))
</reference>
<bodyText confidence="0.999958222222222">
This equivalence states that, if an agent (CP,) believes
that the performance of some action (ad contributes in
part to the performance of another action (A), and if CP.,
intends for CP2 to (intend to) do both of these actions,
then his intention that CP2 (intend to) perform a; is
dominated by his intention that CP2 (intend to) perform
A. Viewed intuitively, CPI&apos;s belief that doing a; will
contribute to doing A underlies his intention to get CP2
to do A by getting CP2 to do ai. The satisfaction of CPI&apos;s
intention for CP2 to do a; will help satisfy CPI&apos;s intention
for CP2 to do A.
So, for example, in the task-oriented dialogue of
Section 3.2, the expert knows that using the wheelpuller
is a necessary part of removing the flywheel. His inten-
tion that the apprentice intend to use the wheelpuller is
thus dominated by his intention that the apprentice
intend to take off the flywheel. Satisfaction of the inten-
tion to use the wheelpuller will contribute to satisfying

the intention to remove the flywheel. In general, the
action ai does not have to be a necessary action though it
is in this example (at least if the task is done correctly).
A definitive statement characterizing primary and
subsidiary intentions for task-oriented dialogues awaits
further research not only in discourse theory, but also in
the theory of intentions and actions. In particular, a
clearer statement of the interactions among the
intentions of the various discourse participants (with
respect to both linguistic and nonlinguistic actions)
awaits the formulation of a better theory of cooperation
and multiagent activity.

7.4 RHETORICAL RELATIONS
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999967148148148">
We are now in a position to contrast the role of
DP/DSPs, supports, generates, DOM, and SP in our theo-
ry with the rhetorical relations that, according to a
number of alternative theories (e.g., Grimes 1975, Hobbs
1979, Mann and Thompson 1983, Reichman-Adar 1984,
McKeown 1985), are claimed to underlie discourse struc-
ture. Among the various rhetorical relations that have
been investigated are elaboration, summarization,
enablement, justification, and challenge. Although the
theories each identify different specific relations, they all
use such relations as the basis for determining discourse
structure.
These rhetorical relations apply specifically to linguis-
tic behavior and most of them implicitly incorporate
intentions (e.g., the intention to summarize, the intention
to justify). The intentions that typically serve as DP/DSPs
in our theory are more basic than those that underlie
such rhetorical relations in that they are not specialized
for linguistic behavior; in many cases, their satisfaction
can be realized by nonlinguistic actions as well as linguis-
tic ones.
The supports and generates relations that must some-
times be inferred to determine domination are also more
basic than rhetorical relations; they are general relations
that hold between propositions and actions. Hence, the
inferring of relationships such as supports and generates
is simpler than that of rhetorical relationships. The
determination of whether a supports or generates
relationship exists depends only on facts of how the
world is, not on facts of the discourse. In contrast, the
recognition of rhetorical relations requires the combined
use of discourse and domain information.
For several reasons, rhetorical relationships do not
have a privileged status in the account given here.
Although they appear to provide a metalevel description
of the discourse, their role in discourse interpretation
remains unclear. As regards discourse processing, it
seems obvious that the ICP and OCP have essentially
different access to them. In particular, the ICP may well
have such rhetorical relationships &amp;quot;in mind&amp;quot; as he
produces utterances (as in McKeown&apos;s (1985) system),
whereas it is much less clear when (if at all) the OCP
infers them. A claim of the theory being developed in this
paper is that a discourse can be understood at a basic
level even if the OCP never does or can construct, let
alone name, such rhetorical relationships. Furthermore,
it appears that these relationships could be recast as a
combination of domain-specific information, general
relations between propositions and actions (e.g., supports
and generates), and general relations between intentions
(e.g., domination and satisfaction-precedence) •20 Even
so, rhetorical relationships are, in all likelihood, useful to
the theoretician as an analytical tool for certain aspects
of discourse analysis.

8 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999995142857143">
The theory of discourse structure presented in this paper
is a generalization of theories of task-oriented dialogues.
It differs from previous generalizations in that it carefully
distinguishes three components of discourse structure:
one linguistic, one intentional, and one attentional. This
distinction provides an essential basis for explaining
interruptions, cue phrases, and referring expressions.
The particular intentional structure used also differs
from the analogous aspect of previous generalizations.
Although, like those generalizations, it supplies the prin-
cipal framework for discourse segmentation and deter-
mines structural relationships for the focusing structure
(part of the attentional state), unlike its predecessors it
does not depend on the special details of any single
domain or type of discourse.
Although admittedly still incomplete, the theory does
provide a solid basis for investigating both the structure
and meaning of discourse, as well as for constructing
discourse-processing systems. Several difficult research
problems remain to be explored. Of these, we take the
following to be of primary importance:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.892988090909091">
1. Specification of the relationship between discourse-
level (DP/DSP) and utterance-level intentions;
2. Identification of the information that discourse partic-
ipants use to recognize these intentions, and the ways
in which they utilize it;
3 Development of an adequate treatment of the inter-
action among intentions of multiple participants;
4. Investigation of the effect of multiple DSPs on the
theory;
5. Investigation of alternative models of attentional
state.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999781916666667">
Finally, the theory suggests several important conjec-
tures. First, that a discourse is coherent only when its
discourse purpose is shared by all the participants and
when each utterance of the discourse contributes to
achieving this purpose, either directly or indirectly, by
contributing to the satisfaction of a discourse segment
purpose. Second, general intuitions about &amp;quot;topic&amp;quot; corre-
spond most closely to DP/DSPs, rather than to syntactic
or attentional concepts. Finally, the theory suggests that
the same intentional structure can give rise to different
attentional structures through different discourses. The
different attentional structures will be manifest in part

NOTES
1. The use of the phrase &amp;quot;linguistic structure&amp;quot; to refer to the struc-
ture of sequences of utterances is a natural extension of its use in
traditional linguistic theories to refer to the syntactic structure of
individual sentences. To avoid confusion the phrase &amp;quot;linguistic
structure&amp;quot; will be used in this paper only to refer to the structure
of a sequence of utterances composing a discourse or discourse
segment.
2. Mann has also reported that the subjects did not label segments
nearly so consistently. We believe this fact is related to the kinds
of relations the labels were dependent upon. As discussed in
Section 7.4, there is a difference between the intentional structure
we describe and the relations that others use.
3. Referring expressions can also be used to mark a discourse bound-
ary. For example, novelists sometimes use pronouns to indicate a
new scene in a story.
4. These two relations are similar to ones that play a role in parsing
at the sentence level: immediate dominance and linear precedence.
However, the dominance relation, like the one in Marcus and
Hindle&apos;s D-theory (Marcus et al. 1983), is partial (i.e., nonimme-
diate).
5. Even in the task case the orderings may be partial. In fact, the
systems built for task-oriented dialogues (Robinson 1981, Walker
1978) did not use a prebuilt tree, but constructed the tree — based
on a partially-ordered model — only as a given discourse evolved.
6. The observant reader will note that this was written in the early
days of the cinema, before the advent of sound; hence the quota-
tion marks around &amp;quot;movies.&amp;quot; Note also that utterance (7) contains
a somewhat odd preposition, and utterance (16) somewhat odd
definite noun phrases. We have quoted the text exactly as it was
printed.
7. The segmentation omits some levels of detail. For example, utter-
ances 19-24 are a segment within DS5. Rather than present this
detail, we concentrate on the larger segments here so as to focus
on the major issues with which this paper is concerned.
8. This modification &amp;quot;folds in&amp;quot; an informing action with the request.
Such combining of two types of speech acts is similar to the action
subsumption that Appelt (1985) discusses in regard to referring
expressions.
9. Hirschberg and Pierrehumbert (1986) have shown recently that
intonational features, most notably pitch range, can also be used
to indicate discourse segment boundaries.
10. We assume here that the OCP must recognize intentions rather
than actions. The argument that such is the case is beyond the
scope of this paper. At a very general level, it centers on the
possibility that the very same sequence of utterance actions will
correspond to two different discourse structures with the differ-
ence statable only in terms of the ICP&apos;s intentions. The possibility
of such sequences was suggested to us by Michael Bratman
[personal communication]. The irony contained in such a clause as
you&apos;re a real sweetheart illustrates the need to consider intentions.
11. This knowledge may be available prior to the discourse or from
information supplied by previous utterances in the discourse.
12. This boundary is clearly atypical of stacks. It suggests that ulti-
mately the stack model is not quite what is needed. What struc-
ture should replace the stack remains unclear to us.
13. Because this is so clearly the case on other grounds, the segment
boundary is obvious even to a reader after the fact.
14. From just the fragment presented, all that can be determined is
that the two dominates relationships are domination but not direct
domination.
15. OK is many ways ambiguous. It may also mean (at least) I heard
what you said, I heard and intend to do what you intend me to intend,
I am done what I undertook to do, or I approve what you are about to
do.
16. This portion is taken from Redefinition IVB: a further redefinition
deals with abstracting about audience and would unnecessarily
complicate our initial view of intentions and discourse.
17. Grice (1969) mentions iconic, conventional, and associative
modes, giving examples of each.
18. This analogy is meant to help clarify and motivate the discussion.
Although it also suggests some important problems in common
between research on discourse and research on theories of action
and intention, those issues are the subject of another paper.
19. Here again we use a notational shorthand rather than a formal
language to make some of the relationships clearer.
20. This claim reflects a move analogous to the one made by Cohen
and Levesque (1985) in showing that the definitions of various
speech acts can be derived as lemmas within a general theory of
rational behavior.

<abstract confidence="0.99861525">In this paper we explore a new theory of discourse structure that stresses the role of purpose and processing in discourse. In this theory, discourse structure is composed of three separate but interrelated components: the structure of the sequence of utterances (called the linguistic structure), a structure of purposes (called the intentional structure), and the state of focus of attention (called the attentional state). The linguistic structure consists of segments of the discourse into which the utterances naturally aggregate. The intentional structure captures the discourse-relevant purposes, expressed in each of the linguistic segments as well as relationships among them. The attentional state is an abstraction of the focus of attention of the participants as the discourse unfolds. The attentional state, being dynamic, records the objects, properties, and relations that are salient at each point of the discourse. The distinction among these components is essential to provide an adequate explanation of such discourse phenomena as cue phrases, referring expressions, and interruptions. The theory of attention, intention, and aggregation of utterances is illustrated in the paper with a number of example discourses. Various properties of discourse are described, and explanations for the behavior of cue phrases, referring expressions, and interruptions are explored. This theory provides a framework for describing the processing of utterances in a discourse. Discourse processing requires recognizing how the utterances of the discourse aggregate into segments, recognizing the intentions expressed in the discourse and the relationships among intentions, and tracking the discourse through the operation of the mechanisms associated with attentional state. This processing description specifies in these recognition tasks the role of information from the discourse and from the participants&apos; knowledge of the domain.</abstract>

If we assume a focus space is normally popped from the focus stack if and only if a speaker has satisfied the DSP of its corresponding segment, then it naturally follows both that the focus space for the interruption will be popped after the interruption, and that the focus space for the interrupted segment will be at the top of the stack because its DSP is yet to be satisfied. There are other kinds of discourse segments that one may want to consider in light of the interruption continuum and these definitions. Clarification dialogues (Allen 1979) and debugging explanations (Sidner 1983) are two such possibilities. Both of them, unlike the interruptions discussed here, share a DSP with their preceding segment and thus do not conform to our definition of interruption. These kinds of discourses may constitute another general class of discourse segments that, like interruptions, can be abstractly defined. 5.2 TYPE 1: TRUE INTERRUPTIONS The first kind of interruption is the true interruption, which follows the strong definition of interruptions.

Grosz and Candace L. Sidner Attention, Intentions, and the Structure of Discourse The theory is a further development and integration of two lines of research: work on focusing in discourse (Grosz 1978a, 1978b, 1981) and more recent work on intention recognition in discourse (Sidner and Israel 1981; Sidner 1983; 1985; Allen 1983, Litman 1985; Pollack 1986). Our goal has been to generalize these constructs properly to a wide range of discourse types. Grosz (1978a) demonstrated that the notions of focusing and task structure are necessary for understanding and producing task-oriented dialogue. One of the main generalizations of previous work will be to show that discourses are generally in some sense &amp;quot;task-oriented,&amp;quot; but the kinds of &amp;quot;tasks&amp;quot; that can be engaged in are quite varied — some are physical, some mental, others linguistic. Consequently, the term &amp;quot;task&amp;quot; is misleading; we therefore will use the more general ter</context>

In particular, the intentions that underlie discourse are so diverse that approaches to discourse coherence based on selecting discourse relationships from a fixed set of alternative rhetorical patterns (e.g., Hobbs 1979, Mann and Thompson 1983, Reichman 1981) are unlikely to suffice. The intentional structure introduced in this paper depends instead on a small number of structural relations that can hold between intentions. This study also reveals several problems that must be confronted in expanding speech-act-related theories (e.g., Allen and Perrault 1980, Cohen and Levesque 1980, Allen 1983) from coverage of individual utterances to coverage of extended sequences of utterances in discourse. Although a definition of discourse must await further development of the theory presented in this paper, some properties of the phenomena we want to explain must be specified now. In particular, we take a discourse to be a piece of language behavior that typically involves multiple utterances and multiple participants.

We must leave to future research (and a subsequent paper) the exploration and discussion of the complications that result from relaxing this assumption. Typically, an ICP will have a number of different kinds of intentions that lead to initiating a discourse. One kind might include intentions to speak in a certain language or to utter certain words. Another might include intentions to amuse or to impress. The kinds of intentions that can serve as discourse purposes or discourse segment purposes are distinguished from other intentions by the fact that they are intended to be recognized (cf. Allen and Perrault 1980, Sidner 1985), whereas other intentions are private; that is, the recognition of the DP or DSP is essential to its achieving its intended effect. Discourse purposes and discourse segment purposes share this property with certain utterance-level intentions that Grice (1969) uses in defining utterance meaning (see Section 7). It is important to distinguish intentions that are intended to be recognized from other kinds of intentions that are associated with discourse. Intentions that are intended to be recognized achieve their intended effect only if the intention is recognized. For example, a c</context>

The distinction among these components is essential to an explanation of interruptions (see Section 5), as well as to explanations of the use of certain types of referring expressions (see Section 4.2) and various other expressions that affect discourse segmentation and structure (see Section 6). Most related work on discourse structure (including Reichman-Adar 1984, Linde 1979, Linde and Goguen 1978, Cohen 1983) fails to distinguish among some (or, in some cases, all) of these components. As a result, significant generalizations are lost, and the computational mechanisms proposed are more complex than necessary. By carefully distinguishing these components, we are able to account for significant observations in this related work while simplifying both the explanations given and computational mechanisms used.

It is also possible for two utterances that are nonconsecutive to be in the same segment. Computational Linguistics, Volume 12, Number 3, July-September 1986 The factoring of discourses into segments has been observed across a wide range of discourse types. Grosz (1978a) showed this for task-oriented dialogues. Linde (1979) found it valid for descriptions of apartments; Linde and Goguen (1978) describe such structuring in the Watergate transcripts. Reichman-Adar (1984) observed it in informal debates, explanations, and therapeutic discourse. Cohen (1983) found similar structures in essays in rhetorical texts. Polanyi and Scha (1986) discuss this feature of narratives. Although different researchers with different theories have examined a variety of discourse types and found discourse-level segmentation, there has been very little investigation of the extent of agreement about where the segment boundaries lie. There have been no psychological studies of the consistency of recognition of section boundaries. However, Mann (Mann et al. 1975) asked several people to segment a set of dialogues. He has reported [personal communication] that his subj</context>

Not surprisingly, linguistic expressions are among the primary indicators of discourse segment boundaries. The explicit use of certain words and phrases (e.g., in the first place) and more subtle cues, such as intonation or changes in tense and aspect, are included in the repertoire of linguistic devices that function, wholly or in part, to indicate these 177 Barbara J. Grosz and Candace L. Sidner Attention, Intentions, and the Structure of Discourse boundaries (Grosz 1978a, Reichman-Adar 1984, Cohen 1983, Polanyi and Scha 1983, Hirschberg and Pierrehumbert 1986). Reichman (1981) discusses some words that function in this way and coined the term clue words. We will use the term cue phrases to generalize on her observation as well as many others because each one of these devices cue the hearer to some change in the discourse structure. As discussed in Section 6, these linguistic boundary markers can be divided according to whether they explicitly indicate changes in the intentional structure or in the attentional state of the discourse. The differential use of these linguistic markers provides </context>

In each case, we point out some of the linguistic devices used to indicate segment boundaries as well as some of the expressions whose interpretations depend on those boundaries. The analysis is concerned with specifying certain aspects of the behavior to be explicated by a theory of discourse; the remainder of the paper provides a partial account of this behavior. 3.1 AN ARGUMENT Our first example is an argument taken from a rhetoric text (Holmes and Gallagher 19176). It is an example used by Cohen (1983) in her work on the structure of arguments. Figure 2 shows the dialogue and the eight discourse segments of which it is composed. The division of the argument into separate (numbered) clauses is Cohen&apos;s, but our analysis of the discourse structure is different, since in Cohen&apos;s analysis, every utterance is directly subordinated to another utterance, and there is only one structure to encode linguistic segmentation and the purposes of utterances. Although both analyses segment utterance (4) separately from utterances (1-3), some readers place this utterance in DS1 with utterances (1) through (3</context>
<context position="71021" citStr="Cohen (1983)" startWordPosition="11424" endWordPosition="11425">. Hence determining dominance yields the support relation. The support relation can also yield dominance. Utterances (12)-(14), which comprise DS7, are not explicitly marked for a dominance relation. It can be inferred from the fact that the propositions in (12)-(14) provide support for the proposition embedded in DSP6 (that is, that the stories in movies are exciting and over-emotional) that DSP6 dominates DSP7. Finally, the more information an ICP supplies explicitly in the actual utterances of a discourse, the less reasoning about domain information an OCP has to do to achieve recognition. Cohen (1983) has made a similar claim regarding the problem of recognizing the relationship between one proposition and another. 4.1.2 WHEN IS THE INTENTION RECOGNIZED? As discussed in Section 2.2, the intentional structure evolves as the discourse does. By the same token, the discourse participants&apos; mental-state correlates of the intentional structure are not prebuilt; neither participant may have a complete model of the intentional structure &amp;quot;in mind&amp;quot; until the discourse is completed. The dominance relationships that actually shape the intentional structure cannot be known a priori, because the specific</context>

It is exemplified by the interruption given in the previous subsection. Discourses D1 and D2 have distinct, unrelated purposes and convey different information about properties, objects, and relations. Since D2 occurs within D1, one expects the discourse structures for the two segments to be somehow embedded as well. The theory described in this paper differs from Polanyi and Scha&apos;s (1984; and other more radically different proposals as well; e.g., Linde and Goguen 1978, Cohen 1983, Reich192 Computational Linguistics, Volume 12, Number 3, July-September 1986 Barbara J.

As shown in Figure 8, the focus space for D2 is pushed onto the stack above the focus space for D1, so that the focus space for D2 is more salient than the one for D1, until D2 is completed. The intentional structures for the two segments are distinct. There are two DP/DSP structures for the utterances in this sequence — one for those in D1 and </context>

Another might include intentions to amuse or to impress. The kinds of intentions that can serve as discourse purposes or discourse segment purposes are distinguished from other intentions by the fact that they are intended to be recognized (cf. Allen and Perrault 1980, Sidner 1985), whereas other intentions are private; that is, the recognition of the DP or DSP is essential to its achieving its intended effect. Discourse purposes and discourse segment purposes share this property with certain utterance-level intentions that Grice (1969) uses in defining utterance meaning (see Section 7). It is important to distinguish intentions that are intended to be recognized from other kinds of intentions that are associated with discourse. Intentions that are intended to be recognized achieve their intended effect only if the intention is recognized. For example, a compliment achieves its intended effect only if the intention to compliment is recognized; in contrast, a scream of boo typically achieves its intended effect (scaring the hearer) without the hearer having to recognize the speaker&apos;s intention.

Furthermore, it is clear that linguistic expressions can function as cue phrases, as well as sentential connections; they can tell the hearer about changes in the discourse structure and be carriers of discourse, rather than sentence-level semantic, meaning. 7 SOME PROPERTIES AND PROBLEMS OF DISCOURSE-LEVEL INTENTIONS The intentions that serve as DP/DSPs are natural extensions of the intentions Grice (1969) considers essential to developing a theory of utterer&apos;s meaning. There is a crucial difference, however, between our use of discourse-level intentions in this paper (and the theory, as developed so far) and Grice&apos;s use of utterance-level intentions. We are not yet addressing the issue of discourse meaning, but are concerned with the role of DP/DSPs in determining discourse structure and in specifying how these intentions can be recognized by an OCP. Although the intentional structure of a discourse plays a role in determining discourse meaning, the DP/DSPs do not in and of themselves constitu</context>

There is no overt linguistic marker of the beginning of DS7; its separation must be inferred from DSP7 and its relationship to DSP6. 3.2 A TASK-ORIENTED DIALOGUE The second example is a fragment of a task-oriented dialogue taken from Grosz (1981; it is from the same corpus that was used by Grosz 1974).

These words can be used for either move. For example, in a task-oriented discourse during which some task has been mentioned but put aside to ask a question, the use of now indicates a change of focus. The utterance following now, however, will either return the discussion to the deferred task or will introduce some new task for consideration. Note, finally, that a pop of the focus stack may be achieved without the use of cue phrases as in the following fragment of a task-oriented dialogue (Grosz 1974): A: One bolt is stuck. I&apos;m trying to use both the pliers and the wrench to get it unstuck, but I haven&apos;t had much luck. E: Don&apos;t use pliers. Show me what you are doing. A: I&apos;m pointing at the bolts. E: Show me the 1/2&amp;quot; combination wrench, please. A: OK. E: Good, now show me the 1/2&amp;quot; box wrench. A: I already got it loosened. The last utterance in this fragment returns the discourse to the discussion of the unstuck bolt. The pop can be inferred only from the content of the main portion of the utterance.

The stack contains (in bottom-totop order) focus spaces FS1, FS4, and FS5 for segments DS1, DS4, and DS5, respectively. For DS5 the wheelpuller is a focused entity, while for D54 the two setscrews are (because they are explicitly mentioned). The entities in FS5 are considered before those in FS4 as potential referents. The wheelpuller has three screws: two small screws fasten the side arms, and a large screw in the center is the main functioning part. As a result, this large screw is implicitly in focus in FS5 (Grosz 1977) and thus identified as the referent without the two setscrews ever being considered. Attentional state also constrains the search for referents of pronouns. Because pronouns contain less explicit information about their referents than definite descriptions, additional mechanisms are needed to account for what may and may not be pronominalized in the discourse. One such mechanism is centering (which we previously called immediate focusing; Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein 1983; Sidner 1979). Centering, like focusing, is a dynamic behavior, but is a more local phenomenon. In brief, a backward-lookin</context>

Each plays a part in the OCP&apos;s recognition of the DSP and can be utilized by the ICP to facilitate this recognition. Cue phrases are the most distinguished linguistic means that speakers have for indicating discourse segment boundaries and conveying information about the DSP. Recent evidence by Hirschberg and Pierrehumbert (1986) suggests that certain intonational properties of utterances also provide partial information about the DSP relationships. Because some cue phrases may be used as clausal connectors, there is a need to distinguish their discourse use from their use in conveying propositional content at the utterance level. For example, the word but functions as a boundary marker in utterance (7) of the discourse in Section 3.1, but it can also be used solely (as in the current utterance) to convey propositional content (e.g., the conjunction of two propositions) and serve to connect two clauses within a segmen</context>

In addition to explicating these linguistic phenomena, the theory provides an overall framework within which to answer questions about the relevance of various segments of discourse to one another and to the overall purposes of the discourse participants. Various properties of the intentional component have implications for research in natural-language processing in general. In particular, the intentions that underlie discourse are so diverse that approaches to discourse coherence based on selecting discourse relationships from a fixed set of alternative rhetorical patterns (e.g., Hobbs 1979, Mann and Thompson 1983, Reichman 1981) are unlikely to suffice. The intentional structure introduced in this paper depends instead on a small number of structural relations that can hold between intentions. This study also reveals several problems that must be confronted in expanding speech-act-related theories (e.g., Allen and Perrault 1980, Cohen and Levesque 1980, Allen 1983) from coverage of individual utterances to coverage of extended sequences of utterances in discourse.

The division of the argument into separate (numbered) clauses is Cohen&apos;s, but our analysis of the discourse structure is different, since in Cohen&apos;s analysis, every utterance is directly subordinated to another utterance, and there is only one structure to encode linguistic segmentation and the purposes of utterances. Although both analyses segment utterance (4) separately from utterances (1-3), some readers place this uttera</context>

Sidner Attention, Intentions, and the Structure of Discourse Several researchers (e.g., Linde and Goguen 1978, Reichman-Adar 1984) misinterpreted the original research in an unfortunate and unintended way: they took the focus-space hierarchy to include (or be identical to) the task structure. The conflation of these two structures forces a single structure to contain information about attentional state, intentional relationships, and general task, knowledge. It prevents a theory from accounting adequately for certain aspects of discourse, including interruptions (see Section 5). A second instance of confusion was to infer (incorrectly) that the task structure was necessarily a prebuilt tree. If the t</context>

It is exemplified by the interruption given in the previous subsection. Discourses D1 and D2 have distinct, unrelated purposes and convey different information about properties, objects, and relations. Since D2 occurs within D1, one expects the discourse structures for the two segments to be somehow embedded as well. The theory described in this paper differs from Polanyi and Scha&apos;s (1984; and other more radically different proposals as well; e.g., Linde and Goguen 1978, Cohen 1983, Reich192 Computational Linguistics, Volume 12, Number 3, July-September 1986 Barbara J.

As shown in Figure 8, the focus space for D2 is pushed onto the stack above the focus space for D1, so that the focus space for D2 is more salient than the one for D1, until D2 is completed. The intentional structures for the two segments are distinct. There are two DP/DSP structures for the utterances in this sequence — one for thos</context>

Various properties of the intentional component have implications for research in natural-language processing in general. In particular, the intentions that underlie discourse are so diverse that approaches to discourse coherence based on selecting discourse relationships from a fixed set of alternative rhetorical patterns (e.g., Hobbs 1979, Mann and Thompson 1983, Reichman 1981) are unlikely to suffice. The intentional structure introduced in this paper depends instead on a small number of structural relations that can hold between intentions. This study also reveals several problems that must be confronted in expanding speech-act-related theories (e.g., Allen and Perrault 1980, Cohen and Levesque 1980, Allen 1983) from coverage of individual utterances to coverage of extended sequences of utterances in discourse.

There is no finite list of discourse purposes, as there is, say, of syntactic categories. It remains an unresolved research question whether there is a finite description of the open-ended set of such intentions. However, even if there were finite descriptions, there would still be no finite list of Computational Linguistics, Volume 12, Number 3, July-September 1986 intentions from which to choose. Thus, a theory of discourse structure cannot depend on choosing the DP/DSPs from a fixed list (cf. Reichman-Adar 1984, Schank et al. 1982, Mann and Thompson 1983), nor on the particulars of individual intentions. Although the particulars of individual intentions, like a wide range of common sense knowledge, are crucial to understanding any discourse, such particulars cannot serve as the basis for determining discourse structure. What is essential for discourse structure is that such intentions bear certain kinds of structural relationships to one another. Since the CPs can never know the whole set of intentions that might serve as DP/DSPs, what they must recognize is the relevant structural relationships among intentions.

Not surprisingly, linguistic expressions are among the primary indicators of discourse segment boundaries. The explicit use of certain words and phrases (e.g., in the first place) and more subtle cues, such as intonation or changes in tense and aspect, are included in the repertoire of linguistic devices that function, wholly or in part, to indicate these 177 Barbara J.

Reichman (1981) discusses some words that function in this way and coined the term clue words. We will use the term cue phrases to generalize on her observation as well as many others because each one of these devices cue the hearer to some change in the discourse structure. As discussed in Section 6, these linguistic boundary markers can be divided according to whether they explicitly indicate changes in the intentional structure or in the attentional state of the discourse.

In this sample discourse, however, D1 is resumed almost immediately. The pronoun them in and I put them away cannot refer to the children (the focus space for D2 has been popped from the stack), but only to the groceries. For this to be clear to the OCP, the ICP must indicate a return to D1 explicitly. One linguistic indicator in this example is the change of mood from imperative. Indicators that the stop that utterance is an interruption include the change to imperative mood and the use of the vocative (Polanyi and Scha 1983). Two other indicators may be assumed to have been present at the time of the discourse — a change of intonation (imagine a slightly shrill tone of command with an undercurrent of annoyance) and a shift of gaze (toward and then away from the kids). It is also possible that the type of pause present in such cases is evidence of the interruption, but further research is needed to establish whether this is indeed the case.

Two issues that are central to the recognition problem are what information the OCP can utilize in effecting the recognition and at what point in the discourse that information becomes available. An adequate computational model of the recognition process depends critically on an adequate theory of intention and action; this, of course, is a large research problem in itself and one not restricted to matters of discourse. The need to use such a model for discourse, however, adds certain constraints on the adequacy of any theory or model. Pollack (1986) describes several properties such theories and models must possess if they are to be adequate for supporting recognition of intention in single-utterance queries; she shows how current Al planning models are inadequate and proposes an alternative planning formalism. The need to enable recognition of discourse-level intentions leads to yet another set of requirements. As will become clear in what follows, the information available to the OCP comes from a variety of sources. Each of these can typically provide partial information about the DSPs and their relationships. These sources are each pa</context>

Our main thesis is that the structure of any discourse is a composite of three distinct but interacting components: • the structure of the actual sequence of utterances in the discourse; • a structure of intentions; • an attentional state. The distinction among these components is essential to an explanation of interruptions (see Section 5), as well as to explanations of the use of certain types of referring expressions (see Section 4.2) and various other expressions that affect discourse segmentation and structure (see Section 6). Most related work on discourse structure (including Reichman-Adar 1984, Linde 1979, Linde and Goguen 1978, Cohen 1983) fails to distinguish among some (or, in some cases, all) of these components. As a result, significant generalizations are lost, and the computational mechanisms proposed are more complex than necessary. By carefully distinguishing these components, we are able to account for significant observations in this related work while simplifying both the explanations given and computational mechanisms used. In addition to explicating these linguistic phenomena, the theory provides an overall framework within which to answer questions about the relevanc</context>

It is also possible for two utterances that are nonconsecutive to be in the same segment. Computational Linguistics, Volume 12, Number 3, July-September 1986 The factoring of discourses into segments has been observed across a wide range of discourse types. Grosz (1978a) showed this for task-oriented dialogues. Linde (1979) found it valid for descriptions of apartments; Linde and Goguen (1978) describe such structuring in the Watergate transcripts. Reichman-Adar (1984) observed it in informal debates, explanations, and therapeutic discourse. Cohen (1983) found similar structures in essays in rhetorical texts. Polanyi and Scha (1986) discuss this feature of narratives. Although different researchers with different theories have examined a variety of discourse types and found discourse-level segmentation, there has been very little investigation of the extent of agreement about where the segment boundaries lie. There have been no psychological studies of the consistency of recognition of section boundaries. However, Mann (Mann et al. 1975) asked several peopl</context>

Not surprisingly, linguistic expressions are among the primary indicators of discourse segment boundaries. The explicit use of certain words and phrases (e.g., in the first place) and more subtle cues, such as intonation or changes in tense and aspect, are included in the repertoire of linguistic devices that function, wholly or in part, to indicate these 177 Barbara J. Grosz and Candace L. Sidner Attention, Intentions, and the Structure of Discourse boundaries (Grosz 1978a, Reichman-Adar 1984, Cohen 1983, Polanyi and Scha 1983, Hirschberg and Pierrehumbert 1986). Reichman (1981) discusses some words that function in this way and coined the term clue words. We will use the term cue phrases to generalize on her observation as well as many others because each one of these devices cue the hearer to some change in the discourse structure. As discussed in Section 6, these linguistic boundary markers can be divided according to whether they explicitly indicate changes in the intentional structure or in the attentional state of the discourse. The differential use of these linguistic marke</context>

There is no finite list of discourse purposes, as there is, say, of syntactic categories.

However, even if there were finite descriptions, there would still be no finite list of Computational Linguistics, Volume 12, Number 3, July-September 1986 intentions from which to choose. Thus, a theory of discourse structure cannot depend on choosing the DP/DSPs from a fixed list (cf. Reichman-Adar 1984, Schank et al. 1982, Mann and Thompson 1983), nor on the particulars of individual intentions. Although the particulars of individual intentions, like a wide range of common sense knowledge, are crucial to understanding any discourse, such particulars cannot serve as the basis for determining discourse structure. What is essential for discourse structure is that such intentions bear certain kinds of structural relationships to one another.

Computational Linguistics, Volume 12, Number 3, July-September 1986 181 Barbara J. Grosz and Candace L. Sidner Attention, Intentions, and the Structure of Discourse Several researchers (e.g., Linde and Goguen 1978, Reichman-Adar 1984) misinterpreted the original research in an unfortunate and unintended way: they took the focus-space hierarchy to include (or be identical to) the task structure. The conflation of these two structures forces a single structure to contain information about attentional state, intentional relationships, and general task, knowledge. It prevents a theory from accounting adequately for certain aspects of discourse, including interruptions (see Section 5). A second instance of confusion was to infer (incorrectly) that the task structure was necessarily a prebuilt tree. If the task structure is take</context>

It is also possible that the type of pause present in such cases is evidence of the interruption, but further research is needed to establish whether this is indeed the case. In contrast to previous accounts, we are not forced to integrate these two discourses into a single grammatical structure, or to answer questions about the specific relationship between segments D2 and D1, as in Reichman&apos;s model (Reichman-Adar 1984). Instead, the intuition that readers have of an embedding in the discourse structure is captured in the attentional state by the stacking of focus spaces. In addition, a reader&apos;s intuitive impression of the distinctness of the two segments is captured in their different intentional (DP/DSP) structures. 5.3 TYPE 2: FLASHBACKS AND FILLING IN MISSING PLACES Sometimes an ICP interrupts the flow of discussion because some purposes, propositions, or objects need to be brought into the discourse but have not been: the ICP forgot to include those entities first, and so must now go back and fill in th</context>

As a result, this large screw is implicitly in focus in FS5 (Grosz 1977) and thus identified as the referent without the two setscrews ever being considered. Attentional state also constrains the search for referents of pronouns. Because pronouns contain less explicit information about their referents than definite descriptions, additional mechanisms are needed to account for what may and may not be pronominalized in the discourse. One such mechanism is centering (which we previously called immediate focusing; Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein 1983; Sidner 1979). Centering, like focusing, is a dynamic behavior, but is a more local phenomenon. In brief, a backward-looking center is associated with each utterance in a discourse segment; of all the focused elements the backward-looking center is the one that is central in that utterance (i.e., the uttering of the particular sequence of words at that point in the discourse). A combination of syntactic, semantic, and discourse information is used to identify the backward-looking center.

This type of interruption differs from true interruptions both intentionally and linguistically: the DSP for the flashback bears some relationship to the DP for the whole discourse. The linguistic indicator of the flashback typically includes a comment about something going wrong. In addition the audience always remains the same, whereas it may change for a true interruption (as in the example of the previous section). In the example below, taken from Sidner (1982), the 1CP is instructing a mock-up system (mimicked by a person) about how to define and display certain information in a particular knowledge-representation language.

If we assume a focus space is normally popped from the focus stack if and only if a speaker has satisfied the DSP of its corresponding segment, then it naturally follows both that the focus space for the interruption will be popped after the interruption, and that the focus space for the interrupted segment will be at the top of the stack because its DSP is yet to be satisfied. There are other kinds of discourse segments that one may want to consider in light of the interruption continuum and these definitions. Clarification dialogues (Allen 1979) and debugging explanations (Sidner 1983) are two such possibilities. Both of them, unlike the interruptions discussed here, share a DSP with their preceding segment and thus do not conform to our definition of interruption. These kinds of discourses may constitute another general class of discourse segments that, like interruptions, can be abstractly defined. 5.2 TYPE 1: TRUE INTERRUPTIONS The first kind of interruption is the true interruption, which follows the strong definition of interruptions.

Typically, an ICP will have a number of different kinds of intentions that lead to initiating a discourse. One kind might include intentions to speak in a certain language or to utter certain words. Another might include intentions to amuse or to impress. The kinds of intentions that can serve as discourse purposes or discourse segment purposes are distinguished from other intentions by the fact that they are intended to be recognized (cf. Allen and Perrault 1980, Sidner 1985), whereas other intentions are private; that is, the recognition of the DP or DSP is essential to its achieving its intended effect. Discourse purposes and discourse segment purposes share this property with certain utterance-level intentions that Grice (1969) uses in defining utterance meaning (see Section 7). It is important to distinguish intentions that are intended to be recognized from other kinds of intentions that are associated with discourse. Intentions that are intended to be recognized achieve their intended effect only if the intention is recognized. For example, a compliment achi</context>

Furthermore, a given instance of any one of them could contribute to another, or to a different, instance of the same type. For example, the intention that someone intend to identify some object might dominate several intentions that she or he know some property of that object; likewise, the intention to get someone to believe some fact might dominate a number of contributing intentions that that person believe other facts. As the above list makes clear, the range of intentions that can serve as discourse, or discourse segment, purposes is open-ended (cf. Wittgenstein 1953: paragraph 23), much like the range of intentions that underlie more general purposeful action. There is no finite list of discourse purposes, as there is, say, of syntactic categories. It remains an unresolved research question whether there is a finite description of the open-ended set of such intentions. However, even if there were finite descriptions, there would still be no finite list of Computational Linguistics, Volume 12, Number 3, July-September 1986 intentions from which to choose. Thus, a theory of discourse structure cannot depend on choosing the DP/DSPs from a fixed list (cf. Re</context>

It appears that many of the descriptions of sentence topic correspond (though not always) to centers, while discourse topic corresponds to the DSP of a segment or of the discourse. 5 APPLICATION OF THE THEORY: INTERRUPTIONS Interruptions in discourses pose an important test of any theory of discourse structure.

In all the interruptions we have considered so far, the stack must be popped when the interruption is over and the interrupted discourse is resumed. The focus space for the interrupted segment is &amp;quot;returned to.&amp;quot; In the case of semantic returns, entities and DSPs that were salient during a discourse in the past are taken up once again, but are explicitly reintroduced.

The pop can be inferred only from the content of the main portion of the utterance. The pronoun (or, more accurately, the fact that it cannot be referring to the wrench) is a cue that a pop is needed, but only the reference to the loosening action allows the OCP to recognize to which discourse segment this utterance belongs, as discussed by Sidner (1979) and Robinson (1981).

Each plays a part in the OCP&apos;s recognition of the DSP and can be utilized by the ICP to facilitate this recognition. Cue phrases are the most distinguished linguistic means that speakers have for indicating discourse segment boundaries and conveying information about the DSP. Recent evidence by Hirschberg and Pierrehumbert (1986) suggests that certain intonational properties of utterances also provide partial information about the DSP relationships. Because some cue phrases may be used as clausal connectors, there is a need to distinguish their discourse use from their use in conveying propositional content at the utterance level. For example, the word but functions as a boundary marker in utterance (7) of the discourse in Section 3.1, but it can also be used solely (as in the current utterance) to convey propositional content (e.g., the conjunction of two propositions) and serve to connect two clauses within a segmen</context>

Another might include intentions to amuse or to impress. The kinds of intentions that can serve as discourse purposes or discourse segment purposes are distinguished from other intentions by the fact that they are intended to be recognized (cf. Allen and Perrault 1980, Sidner 1985), whereas other intentions are private; that is, the recognition of the DP or DSP is essential to its achieving its intended effect. Discourse purposes and discourse segment purposes share this property with certain utterance-level intentions that Grice (1969) uses in defining utterance meaning (see Section 7). It is important to distinguish intentions that are intended to be recognized from other kinds of intentions that are associated with discourse. Intentions that are intended to be recognized achieve their intended effect only if the intention is recognized. For example, a compliment achieves its intended effect only if the intention to compliment is recognized; in contrast, a scream of boo typically achieves its intended effect (scaring the hearer) without the hearer having to recognize the speaker&apos;s intention.
