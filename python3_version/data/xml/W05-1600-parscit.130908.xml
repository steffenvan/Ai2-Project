We are happy to introduce the proceedings of the 10th European Workshop
on Natural Language Generation (ENLG-05). This workshop is the tenth
in a biennial series of workshops on natural language generation that has
been running since 1987. Previous European workshops have been held at
Royaumont, Edinburgh, Judenstein, Pisa, Leiden, Duisburg, Toulouse and
Budapest. The series provides a regular forum both for NLG specialists
and for researchers who may not think of themselves as part of the NLG
community.
The 2005 workshop, immediately following IJCAI-2005 in Edinburgh,
spans the interest areas of natural language generation and artificial intel-
ligence. We have selected 16 full papers and 12 poster papers covering a
wide range of topics, including research that integrates NLG with AI, with
ontologies, and with spoken and multimodal dialogue systems, in addition
to new research on mainstream NLG issues.
We would like to thank the members of the program committee for their
timely reviews of the exceptionally large number of submitted papers. In
particular, we thank Kevin Knight, our invited speaker. We also thank
SIGGEN for endorsing the workshop, and both EPSRC and the University
of Aberdeen for their support.

Abstract: Probabilistic finite-state methods have been very successful
for natural language processing (NLP) problems like tagging, entity iden-
tification, and transliteration. These methods have also been packaged in
very useful software toolkits. However, they are not so good for attacking
problems with large-scale reordering (translation, generation, paraphrasing,
question answering, etc.) and sensitivity to syntax. Over the past three
years, new probabilistic tree-based models have been built and tested for a
variety of NLP applications. Many of these models turn out to be instances
of tree transducers, a formal automata model first described by W. Rounds
and J. Thatcher in 1970. This opens up new opportunities for us to marry
deeper representations, automata theory, and machine learning, and to cre-
ate general-purpose tools that can be applied to many NLP problems. This
talk will cover new learning algorithms for tree automata, and large-scale
natural language experiments.
Note: In addition to the invited talk at ENLG-05, Kevin Knight will
give a tutorial on Statistical Machine Translation and Generation the day
after the workshop.
