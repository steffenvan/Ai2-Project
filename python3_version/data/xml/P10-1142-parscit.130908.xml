Noun phrase (NP) coreference resolution, the task
of determining which NPs in a text or dialogue re-
fer to the same real-world entity, has been at the
core of natural language processing (NLP) since
the 1960s. NP coreference is related to the task
of anaphora resolution, whose goal is to identify
an antecedent for an anaphoric NP (i.e., an NP
that depends on another NP, specifically its an-
tecedent, for its interpretation) [see van Deemter
and Kibble (2000) for a detailed discussion of the
difference between the two tasks]. Despite its sim-
ple task definition, coreference is generally con-
sidered a difficult NLP task, typically involving
the use of sophisticated knowledge sources and
inference procedures (Charniak, 1972). Compu-
tational theories of discourse, in particular focus-
ing (see Grosz (1977) and Sidner (1979)) and cen-
tering (Grosz et al. (1983; 1995)), have heavily
influenced coreference research in the 1970s and
1980s, leading to the development of numerous
centering algorithms (see Walker et al. (1998)).
The focus of coreference research underwent a
gradual shift from heuristic approaches to machine
learning approaches in the 1990s. This shift can
be attributed in part to the advent of the statisti-
cal NLP era, and in part to the public availability
of annotated coreference corpora produced as part
of the MUC-6 (1995) and MUC-7 (1998) confer-
ences. Learning-based coreference research has
remained vibrant since then, with results regularly
published not only in general NLP conferences,
but also in specialized conferences (e.g., the bien-
nial Discourse Anaphora and Anaphor Resolution
Colloquium (DAARC)) and workshops (e.g., the
series of Bergen Workshop on Anaphora Resolu-
tion (WAR)). Being inherently a clustering task,
coreference has also received a lot of attention in
the machine learning community.
Fifteen years have passed since the first paper
on learning-based coreference resolution was pub-
lished (Connolly et al., 1994). Our goal in this
paper is to provide NLP researchers with a sur-
vey of the major milestones in supervised coref-
erence research, focusing on the computational
models, the linguistic features, the annotated cor-
pora, and the evaluation metrics that were devel-
oped in the past fifteen years. Note that several
leading coreference researchers have published
books (e.g., Mitkov (2002)), written survey arti-
cles (e.g., Mitkov (1999), Strube (2009)), and de-
livered tutorials (e.g., Strube (2002), Ponzetto and
Poesio (2009)) that provide a broad overview of
coreference research. This survey paper aims to
complement, rather than supersede, these previ-
ously published materials. In particular, while ex-
isting survey papers discuss learning-based coref-
erence research primarily in the context of the in-
fluential mention-pair model, we additionally sur-
vey recently proposed learning-based coreference
models, which attempt to address the weaknesses
of the mention-pair model. Due to space limita-
tions, however, we will restrict our discussion to
the most commonly investigated kind of corefer-
ence relation: the identity relation for NPs, exclud-
ing coreference among clauses and bridging refer-
ences (e.g., part/whole and set/subset relations).

notated coreference corpora. The MUC-6 and
MUC-7 corpora, though relatively small (60 doc-
uments each) and homogeneous w.r.t. document
type (newswire articles only), have been exten-
sively used for training and evaluating coreference
models. Equally popular are the corpora produced
by the Automatic Content Extraction (ACE1) eval-
uations in the past decade: while the earlier ACE
corpora (e.g., ACE-2) consist of solely English
newswire and broadcast news articles, the later
ones (e.g., ACE 2005) have also included Chi-
nese and Arabic documents taken from additional
sources such as broadcast conversations, webblog,
usenet, and conversational telephone speech.
Coreference annotations are also publicly avail-
able in treebanks. These include (1) the English
Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993), which is la-
beled with coreference links as part of the Onto-
Notes project (Hovy et al., 2006); (2) the T¨ubingen
Treebank (Telljohann et al., 2004), which is a
collection of German news articles consisting of
27,125 sentences; (3) the Prague Dependency
Treebank (Haji˘c et al., 2006), which consists of
3168 news articles taken from the Czech National
Corpus; (4) the NAIST Text Corpus (Iida et al.,
2007b), which consists of 287 Japanese news arti-
cles; (5) the AnCora Corpus (Recasens and Marti,
2009), which consists of Spanish and Catalan jour-
nalist texts; and (6) the GENIA corpus (Ohta et al.,
2002), which contains 2000 MEDLINE abstracts.
Other publicly available coreference corpora of
interest include two annotated by Ruslan Mitkov’s
research group: (1) a 55,000-word corpus in
the domain of security/terrorism (Hasler et al.,
2006); and (2) training data released as part of the
2007 Anaphora Resolution Exercise (Or˘asan et al.,
2008), a coreference resolution shared task. There
are also two that consist of spoken dialogues: the
TRAINS93 corpus (Heeman and Allen, 1995) and
the Switchboard data set (Calhoun et al., in press).
Additional coreference data will be available in
the near future. For instance, the SemEval-2010
shared task on Coreference Resolution in Multiple
Languages (Recasens et al., 2009) has promised to
release coreference data in six languages. In addi-
tion, Massimo Poesio and his colleagues are lead-
ing an annotation project that aims to collect large
amounts of coreference data for English via a Web
Collaboration game called Phrase Detectives2.

3 Learning-Based Coreference Models
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99987025">
In this section, we examine three important classes
of coreference models that were developed in the
past fifteen years, namely, the mention-pair model,
the entity-mention model, and ranking models.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.690801">
3.1 Mention-Pair Model
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999987756756757">
The mention-pair model is a classifier that deter-
mines whether two NPs are coreferent. It was
first proposed by Aone and Bennett (1995) and
McCarthy and Lehnert (1995), and is one of the
most influential learning-based coreference mod-
els. Despite its popularity, this binary classifica-
tion approach to coreference is somewhat undesir-
able: the transitivity property inherent in the coref-
erence relation cannot be enforced, as it is possible
for the model to determine that A and B are coref-
erent, B and C are coreferent, but A and C are not
coreferent. Hence, a separate clustering mecha-
nism is needed to coordinate the pairwise classifi-
cation decisions made by the model and construct
a coreference partition.
Another issue that surrounds the acquisition of
the mention-pair model concerns the way train-
ing instances are created. Specifically, to deter-
mine whether a pair of NPs is coreferent or not,
the mention-pair model needs to be trained on a
data set where each instance represents two NPs
and possesses a class value that indicates whether
the two NPs are coreferent. Hence, a natural way
to assemble a training set is to create one instance
from each pair of NPs appearing in a training doc-
ument. However, this instance creation method is
rarely employed: as most NP pairs in a text are not
coreferent, this method yields a training set with a
skewed class distribution, where the negative in-
stances significantly outnumber the positives.
As a result, in practical implementations of the
mention-pair model, one needs to specify not only
the learning algorithm for training the model and
the linguistic features for representing an instance,
but also the training instance creation method for
reducing class skewness and the clustering algo-
rithm for constructing a coreference partition.

3.1.1 Creating Training Instances
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9990192">
As noted above, the primary purpose of train-
ing instance creation is to reduce class skewness.
Many heuristic instance creation methods have
been proposed, among which Soon et al.’s (1999;
2001) is arguably the most popular choice. Given
</bodyText>

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999956878787879">
an anaphoric noun phrase3, NPk, Soon et al.’s
method creates a positive instance between NPk
and its closest preceding antecedent, NPj, and a
negative instance by pairing NPk with each of the
intervening NPs, NPj+1, ..., NPk−1.
With an eye towards improving the precision of
a coreference resolver, Ng and Cardie (2002c) pro-
pose an instance creation method that involves a
single modification to Soon et al.’s method: if NPk
is non-pronominal, a positive instance should be
formed between NPk and its closest preceding non-
pronominal antecedent instead. This modification
is motivated by the observation that it is not easy
for a human, let alone a machine learner, to learn
from a positive instance where the antecedent of a
non-pronominal NP is a pronoun.
To further reduce class skewness, some re-
searchers employ a filtering mechanism on top of
an instance creation method, thereby disallowing
the creation of training instances from NP pairs
that are unlikely to be coreferent, such as NP pairs
that violate gender and number agreement (e.g.,
Strube et al. (2002), Yang et al. (2003)).
While many instance creation methods are
heuristic in nature (see Uryupina (2004) and Hoste
and Daelemans (2005)), some are learning-based.
For example, motivated by the fact that some
coreference relations are harder to identify than
the others (see Harabagiu et al. (2001)), Ng and
Cardie (2002a) present a method for mining easy
positive instances, in an attempt to avoid the inclu-
sion of hard training instances that may complicate
the acquisition of an accurate coreference model.

Once a training set is created, we can train a coref-
erence model using an off-the-shelf learning algo-
rithm. Decision tree induction systems (e.g., C5
(Quinlan, 1993)) are the first and one of the most
widely used learning algorithms by coreference
researchers, although rule learners (e.g., RIPPER
(Cohen, 1995)) and memory-based learners (e.g.,
TiMBL (Daelemans and Van den Bosch, 2005))
are also popular choices, especially in early appli-
cations of machine learning to coreference resolu-
tion. In recent years, statistical learners such as

and support vector machines (Joachims, 1999)
have been increasingly used, in part due to their
ability to provide a confidence value (e.g., in the
form of a probability) associated with a classifica-
tion, and in part due to the fact that they can be
easily adapted to train recently proposed ranking-
based coreference models (see Section 3.3).

3.1.3 Generating an NP Partition
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999928292682927">
After training, we can apply the resulting model
to a test text, using a clustering algorithm to co-
ordinate the pairwise classification decisions and
impose an NP partition. Below we describe some
commonly used coreference clustering algorithms.
Despite their simplicity, closest-first cluster-
ing (Soon et al., 2001) and best-first clustering
(Ng and Cardie, 2002c) are arguably the most
widely used coreference clustering algorithms.
The closest-first clustering algorithm selects as the
antecedent for an NP, NPk, the closest preceding
noun phrase that is classified as coreferent with it.4
However, if no such preceding noun phrase exists,
no antecedent is selected for NPk. The best-first
clustering algorithm aims to improve the precision
of closest-first clustering, specifically by selecting
as the antecedent of NPk the most probable preced-
ing NP that is classified as coreferent with it.
One criticism of the closest-first and best-first
clustering algorithms is that they are too greedy.
In particular, clusters are formed based on a small
subset of the pairwise decisions made by the
model. Moreover, positive pairwise decisions are
unjustifiably favored over their negative counter-
parts. For example, three NPs are likely to end up
in the same cluster in the resulting partition even if
there is strong evidence that A and C are not coref-
erent, as long as the other two pairs (i.e., (A,B) and
(B,C)) are classified as positive.
Several algorithms that address one or both of
these problems have been used for coreference
clustering. Correlation clustering (Bansal et al.,
2002), which produces a partition that respects
as many pairwise decisions as possible, is used
by McCallum and Wellner (2004), Zelenko et al.
(2004), and Finley and Joachims (2005). Graph
partitioning algorithms are applied on a weighted,
undirected graph where a vertex corresponds to
an NP and an edge is weighted by the pairwise
coreference scores between two NPs (e.g., Mc-
Callum and Wellner (2004), Nicolae and Nico-

lae (2006)). The Dempster-Shafer rule (Dempster,
1968), which combines the positive and negative
pairwise decisions to score a partition, is used by
Kehler (1997) and Bean and Riloff (2004) to iden-
tify the most probable NP partition.
Some clustering algorithms bear a closer resem-
blance to the way a human creates coreference
clusters. In these algorithms, not only are the NPs
in a text processed in a left-to-right manner, the
later coreference decisions are dependent on the
earlier ones (Cardie and Wagstaff, 1999; Klenner
and Ailloud, 2008).5 For example, to resolve an
NP, NPk, Cardie and Wagstaff’s algorithm consid-
ers each preceding NP, NPj, as a candidate an-
tecedent in a right-to-left order. If NPk and NPj
are likely to be coreferent, the algorithm imposes
an additional check that NPk does not violate any
constraint on coreference (e.g., gender agreement)
with any NP in the cluster containing NPj before
positing that the two NPs are coreferent.
Luo et al.’s (2004) Bell-tree-based algorithm is
another clustering algorithm where the later coref-
erence decisions are dependent on the earlier ones.
A Bell tree provides an elegant way of organizing
the space of NP partitions. Informally, a node in
the ith level of a Bell tree corresponds to an ith-
order partial partition (i.e., a partition of the first
i NPs of the given document), and the ith level of
the tree contains all possible ith-order partial parti-
tions. Hence, a leaf node contains a complete par-
tition of the NPs, and the goal is to search for the
leaf node that contains the most probable partition.
The search starts at the root, and a partitioning of
the NPs is incrementally constructed as we move
down the tree. Specifically, based on the corefer-
ence decisions it has made in the first i−1 levels of
the tree, the algorithm determines at the ith level
whether the ith NP should start a new cluster, or to
which preceding cluster it should be assigned.
While many coreference clustering algorithms
have been developed, there have only been a few
attempts to compare their effectiveness. For ex-
ample, Ng and Cardie (2002c) report that best-
first clustering is better than closest-first cluster-
ing. Nicolae and Nicolae (2006) show that best-
first clustering performs similarly to Bell-tree-
based clustering, but neither of these algorithms

Soon et al. (2001) and Ng and Cardie (2002c) also process
the NPs in a sequential manner, but since the later decisions
are not dependent on the earlier ones, the order in which the
NPs are processed does not affect their clustering results.

3.1.4 Determining NP Anaphoricity
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999956457142857">
While coreference clustering algorithms attempt
to resolve each NP encountered in a document,
only a subset of the NPs are anaphoric and there-
fore need to be resolved. Hence, knowledge of the
anaphoricity of an NP can potentially improve the
precision of a coreference resolver.
Traditionally, the task of anaphoricity determi-
nation has been tackled independently of corefer-
ence resolution using a variety of techniques. For
example, pleonastic it has been identified using
heuristic approaches (e.g., Paice and Husk (1987),
Lappin and Leass (1994), Kennedy and Bogu-
raev (1996)), supervised approaches (e.g., Evans
(2001), M¨uller (2006), Versley et al. (2008a)),
and distributional methods (e.g., Bergsma et al.
(2008)); and non-anaphoric definite descriptions
have been identified using rule-based techniques
(e.g., Vieira and Poesio (2000)) and unsupervised
techniques (e.g., Bean and Riloff (1999)).
Recently, anaphoricity determination has been
evaluated in the context of coreference resolution,
with results showing that training an anaphoric-
ity classifier to identify and filter non-anaphoric
NPs prior to coreference resolution can improve
a learning-based resolver (e.g., Ng and Cardie
(2002b), Uryupina (2003), Poesio et al. (2004b)).
Compared to earlier work on anaphoricity deter-
mination, recently proposed approaches are more
“global” in nature, taking into account the pair-
wise decisions made by the mention-pair model
when making anaphoricity decisions. Examples
of such approaches have exploited techniques in-
cluding integer linear programming (ILP) (Denis
and Baldridge, 2007a), label propagation (Zhou
and Kong, 2009), and minimum cuts (Ng, 2009).

From a learning perspective, a two-step approach
to coreference — classification and clustering —
is undesirable. Since the classification model
is trained independently of the clustering algo-
rithm, improvements in classification accuracy
do not guarantee corresponding improvements in
clustering-level accuracy. That is, overall perfor-
mance on the coreference task might not improve.
To address this problem, McCallum and Well-

tering accuracy. Klenner (2007) and Finkel and
Manning (2008) use ILP to ensure that the pair-

3.1.6 Weaknesses of the Mention-Pair Model
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999991695652174">
While many of the aforementioned algorithms
for clustering and anaphoricity determination have
been shown to improve coreference performance,
the underlying model with which they are used
in combination — the mention-pair model — re-
mains fundamentally weak. The model has two
commonly-cited weaknesses. First, since each
candidate antecedent for an anaphoric NP to be
resolved is considered independently of the oth-
ers, the model only determines how good a candi-
date antecedent is relative to the anaphoric NP, but
not how good a candidate antecedent is relative to
other candidates. In other words, it fails to answer
the question of which candidate antecedent is most
probable. Second, it has limitations in its expres-
siveness: the information extracted from the two
NPs alone may not be sufficient for making an in-
formed coreference decision, especially if the can-
didate antecedent is a pronoun (which is semanti-
cally empty) or a mention that lacks descriptive in-
formation such as gender (e.g., “Clinton”). Below
we discuss how these weaknesses are addressed by
the entity-mention model and ranking models.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.920044">
3.2 Entity-Mention Model
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999249084507042">
The entity-mention model addresses the expres-
siveness problem with the mention-pair model.
To motivate the entity-mention model, consider
an example taken from McCallum and Wellner
(2003), where a document consists of three NPs:
“Mr. Clinton,” “Clinton,” and “she.” The mention-
pair model may determine that “Mr. Clinton” and
“Clinton” are coreferent using string-matching
features, and that “Clinton” and “she” are coref-
erent based on proximity and lack of evidence for
gender and number disagreement. However, these
two pairwise decisions together with transitivity
imply that “Mr. Clinton” and “she” will end up in
the same cluster, which is incorrect due to gen-
der mismatch. This kind of error arises in part
because the later coreference decisions are not de-
pendent on the earlier ones. In particular, had the
model taken into consideration that “Mr. Clinton”
6Recently, however, Klenner and Ailloud (2009) have be-
come less optimistic about ILP approaches to coreference.
and “Clinton” were in the same cluster, it proba-
bly would not have posited that “she” and “Clin-
ton” are coreferent. The aforementioned Cardie
and Wagstaff algorithm attempts to address this
problem in a heuristic manner. It would be de-
sirable to learn a model that can classify whether
an NP to be resolved is coreferent with a preced-
ing, possibly partially-formed, cluster. This model
is commonly known as the entity-mention model.
Since the entity-mention model aims to classify
whether an NP is coreferent with a preceding clus-
ter, each of its training instances (1) corresponds
to an NP, NPk, and a preceding cluster, Cj, and
(2) is labeled with either POSITIVE or NEGATIVE,
depending on whether NPk should be assigned to
Cj. Consequently, we can represent each instance
by a set of cluster-level features (i.e., features that
are defined over an arbitrary subset of the NPs in
Cj). A cluster-level feature can be computed from
a feature employed by the mention-pair model by
applying a logical predicate. For example, given
the NUMBER AGREEMENT feature, which deter-
mines whether two NPs agree in number, we can
apply the ALL predicate to create a cluster-level
feature, which has the value YES if NPk agrees in
number with all of the NPs in Cj and NO other-
wise. Other commonly-used logical predicates for
creating cluster-level features include relaxed ver-
sions of the ALL predicate, such as MOST, which
is true if NPk agrees in number with more than half
of the NPs in Cj, and ANY, which is true as long as
NPk agrees in number with just one of the NPs in
Cj. The ability of the entity-mention model to em-
ploy cluster-level features makes it more expres-
sive than its mention-pair counterpart.
Despite its improved expressiveness, the entity-
mention model has not yielded particularly en-
couraging results. For example, Luo et al. (2004)
apply the ANY predicate to generate cluster-level
features for their entity-mention model, which
does not perform as well as the mention-pair
model. Yang et al. (2004b; 2008a) also investi-
gate the entity-mention model, which produces re-
sults that are only marginally better than those of
the mention-pair model. However, it appears that
they are not fully exploiting the expressiveness of
the entity-mention model, as cluster-level features
only comprise a small fraction of their features.
Variants of the entity-mention model have been
investigated. For example, Culotta et al. (2007)
present a first-order logic model that determines
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.93501">
1400
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999970444444444">
the probability that an arbitrary set of NPs are all
co-referring. Their model resembles the entity-
mention model in that it enables the use of cluster-
level features. Daum´e III and Marcu (2005) pro-
pose an online learning model for constructing
coreference chains in an incremental fashion, al-
lowing later coreference decisions to be made by
exploiting cluster-level features that are computed
over the coreference chains created thus far.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999295">
3.3 Ranking Models
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999974536231884">
While the entity-mention model addresses the
expressiveness problem with the mention-pair
model, it does not address the other problem: fail-
ure to identify the most probable candidate an-
tecedent. Ranking models, on the other hand, al-
low us to determine which candidate antecedent
is most probable given an NP to be resolved.
Ranking is arguably a more natural reformula-
tion of coreference resolution than classification,
as a ranker allows all candidate antecedents to be
considered simultaneously and therefore directly
captures the competition among them. Another
desirable consequence is that there exists a nat-
ural resolution strategy for a ranking approach:
an anaphoric NP is resolved to the candidate an-
tecedent that has the highest rank. This contrasts
with classification-based approaches, where many
clustering algorithms have been employed to co-
ordinate the pairwise classification decisions, and
it is still not clear which of them is the best.
The notion of ranking candidate antecedents
can be traced back to centering algorithms, many
of which use grammatical roles to rank forward-
looking centers (see Walker et al. (1998)). Rank-
ing is first applied to learning-based coreference
resolution by Connolly et al. (1994; 1997), where
a model is trained to rank two candidate an-
tecedents. Each training instance corresponds to
the NP to be resolved, NP/,, as well as two candi-
date antecedents, NP� and NPj, one of which is an
antecedent of NP,, and the other is not. Its class
value indicates which of the two candidates is bet-
ter. This model is referred to as the tournament
model by Iida et al. (2003) and the twin-candidate
model by Yang et al. (2003; 2008b). To resolve an
NP during testing, one way is to apply the model to
each pair of its candidate antecedents, and the can-
didate that is classified as better the largest number
of times is selected as its antecedent.
Advances in machine learning have made it pos-
sible to train a mention ranker that ranks all of
the candidate antecedents simultaneously. While
mention rankers have consistently outperformed
the mention-pair model (Versley, 2006; Denis and
Baldridge, 2007b), they are not more expressive
than the mention-pair model, as they are unable
to exploit cluster-level features, unlike the entity-
mention model. To enable rankers to employ
cluster-level features, Rahman and Ng (2009) pro-
pose the cluster-ranking model, which ranks pre-
ceding clusters, rather than candidate antecedents,
for an NP to be resolved. Cluster rankers there-
fore address both weaknesses of the mention-pair
model, and have been shown to improve mention
rankers. Cluster rankers are conceptually similar
to Lappin and Leass’s (1994) heuristic pronoun re-
solver, which resolves an anaphoric pronoun to the
most salient preceding cluster.
An important issue with ranking models that
we have eluded so far concerns the identification
of non-anaphoric NPs. As a ranker simply im-
poses a ranking on candidate antecedents or pre-
ceding clusters, it cannot determine whether an NP
is anaphoric (and hence should be resolved). To
address this problem, Denis and Baldridge (2008)
apply an independently trained anaphoricity clas-
sifier to identify non-anaphoric NPs prior to rank-
ing, and Rahman and Ng (2009) propose a model
that jointly learns coreference and anaphoricity.

Another thread of supervised coreference research
concerns the development of linguistic features.
Below we give an overview of these features.
String-matching features can be computed ro-
bustly and typically contribute a lot to the per-
formance of a coreference system. Besides sim-
ple string-matching operations such as exact string
match, substring match, and head noun match
for different kinds of NPs (see Daum´e III and
Marcu (2005)), slightly more sophisticated string-
matching facilities have been attempted, includ-
ing minimum edit distance (Strube et al., 2002)
and longest common subsequence (Casta˜no et al.,
2002). Yang et al. (2004a) treat the two NPs in-
volved as two bags of words, and compute their
similarity using metrics commonly-used in infor-
mation retrieval, such as the dot product, with each
word weighted by their TF-IDF value.
Syntactic features are computed based on a
syntactic parse tree. Ge et al. (1998) implement

a Hobbs distance feature, which encodes the rank
assigned to a candidate antecedent for a pronoun
by Hobbs’s (1978) seminal syntax-based pronoun
resolution algorithm. Luo and Zitouni (2005) ex-
tract features from a parse tree for implement-
ing Binding Constraints (Chomsky, 1988). Given
an automatically parsed corpus, Bergsma and Lin
(2006) extract from each parse tree a dependency
path, which is represented as a sequence of nodes
and dependency labels connecting a pronoun and
a candidate antecedent, and collect statistical in-
formation from these paths to determine the like-
lihood that a pronoun and a candidate antecedent
connected by a given path are coreferent. Rather
than deriving features from parse trees, Iida et al.
(2006) and Yang et al. (2006) employ these trees
directly as structured features for pronoun resolu-
tion. Specifically, Yang et al. define tree kernels
for efficiently computing the similarity between
two parse trees, and Iida et al. use a boosting-based
algorithm to compute the usefulness of a subtree.
Grammatical features encode the grammati-
cal properties of one or both NPs involved in an
instance. For example, Ng and Cardie’s (2002c)
resolver employs 34 grammatical features. Some
features determine NP type (e.g., are both NPs def-
inite or pronouns?). Some determine the grammat-
ical role of one or both of the NPs. Some encode
traditional linguistic (hard) constraints on corefer-
ence. For example, coreferent NPs have to agree
in number and gender and cannot span one an-
other (e.g., “Google” and “Google employees”).
There are also features that encode general linguis-
tic preferences either for or against coreference.
For example, an indefinite NP (that is not in ap-
position to an anaphoric NP) is not likely to be
coreferent with any NP that precedes it.
There has been an increasing amount of work on
investigating semantic features for coreference
resolution. One of the earliest kinds of seman-
tic knowledge employed for coreference resolu-
tion is perhaps selectional preference (Dagan and
Itai, 1990; Kehler et al., 2004b; Yang et al., 2005;
Haghighi and Klein, 2009): given a pronoun to be
resolved, its governing verb, and its grammatical
role, we prefer a candidate antecedent that can be
governed by the same verb and be in the same role.
Semantic knowledge has also been extracted from
WordNet and unannotated corpora for computing
the semantic compatibility/similarity between two
common nouns (Harabagiu et al., 2001; Versley,
2007) as well as the semantic class of a noun (Ng,
2007a; Huang et al., 2009). One difficulty with
deriving knowledge from WordNet is that one has
to determine which sense of a given word to use.
Some researchers simply use the first sense (Soon
et al., 2001) or all possible senses (Ponzetto and
Strube, 2006a), while others overcome this prob-
lem with word sense disambiguation (Nicolae and
Nicolae, 2006). Knowledge has also been mined
from Wikipedia for measuring the semantic relat-
edness of two NPs, NPj and NPk (Ponzetto and
Strube (2006a; 2007)), such as: whether NPj/k ap-
pears in the first paragraph of the Wiki page that
has NPk/j as the title or in the list of categories to
which this page belongs, and the degree of overlap
between the two pages that have the two NPs as
their titles (see Poesio et al. (2007) for other uses
of encyclopedic knowledge for coreference reso-
lution). Contextual roles (Bean and Riloff, 2004),
semantic relations (Ji et al., 2005), semantic roles
(Ponzetto and Strube, 2006b; Kong et al., 2009),
and animacy (Or˘asan and Evans, 2007) have also
been exploited to improve coreference resolution.
Lexico-syntactic patterns have been used to
capture the semantic relatedness between two NPs
and hence the likelihood that they are coreferent.
For instance, given the pattern X is a Y (which is
highly indicative that X and Y are coreferent), we
can instantiate it with a pair of NPs and search
for the instantiated pattern in a large corpus or
the Web (Daum´e III and Marcu, 2005; Haghighi
and Klein, 2009). The more frequently the pat-
tern occurs, the more likely they are coreferent.
This technique has been applied to resolve dif-
ferent kinds of anaphoric references, including
other-anaphora (Modjeska et al., 2003; Markert
and Nissim, 2005) and bridging references (Poesio
et al., 2004a). While these patterns are typically
hand-crafted (e.g., Garera and Yarowsky (2006)),
they can also be learned from an annotated cor-
pus (Yang and Su, 2007) or bootstrapped from an
unannotated corpus (Bean and Riloff, 2004).
Despite the large amount of work on discourse-
based anaphora resolution in the 1970s and
1980s (see Hirst (1981)), learning-based resolvers
have only exploited shallow discourse-based fea-
tures, which primarily involve characterizing the
salience of a candidate antecedent by measuring
its distance from the anaphoric NP to be resolved
or determining whether it is in a prominent gram-
matical role (e.g., subject). A notable exception
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.985087">
1402
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.9995493125">
is Iida et al. (2009), who train a ranker to rank
the candidate antecedents for an anaphoric pro-
noun by their salience. It is worth noting that
Tetreault (2005) has employed Grosz and Sid-
ner’s (1986) discourse theory and Veins Theory
(Ide and Cristea, 2000) to identify and remove
candidate antecedents that are not referentially ac-
cessible to an anaphoric pronoun in his heuristic
pronoun resolvers. It would be interesting to in-
corporate this idea into a learning-based resolver.
There are also features that do not fall into any
of the preceding categories. For example, a mem-
orization feature is a word pair composed of the
head nouns of the two NPs involved in an in-
stance (Bengtson and Roth, 2008). Memoriza-
tion features have been used as binary-valued fea-
tures indicating the presence or absence of their
words (Luo et al., 2004) or as probabilistic fea-
tures indicating the probability that the two heads
are coreferent according to the training data (Ng,
2007b). An anaphoricity feature indicates whether
an NP to be resolved is anaphoric, and is typ-
ically computed using an anaphoricity classifier
(Ng, 2004), hand-crafted patterns (Daum´e III and
Marcu, 2005), and automatically acquired pat-
terns (Bean and Riloff, 1999). Finally, the outputs
of rule-based pronoun and coreference resolvers
have also been used as features for learning-based
coreference resolution (Ng and Cardie, 2002c).
For an empirical evaluation of the contribution
of a subset of these features to the mention-pair
model, see Bengtson and Roth (2008).

5 Evaluation Issues
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9993945">
Two important issues surround the evaluation of a
coreference resolver. First, how do we obtain the
set of NPs that a resolver will partition? Second,
how do we score the partition it produces?
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.996942">
5.1 Extracting Candidate Noun Phrases
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999420333333333">
To obtain the set of NPs to be partitioned by a re-
solver, three methods are typically used. In the
first method, the NPs are extracted automatically
from a syntactic parser. The second method in-
volves extracting the NPs directly from the gold
standard. In the third method, a mention detec-
tor is first trained on the gold-standard NPs in the
training texts, and is then applied to automatically
extract system mentions in a test text.7 Note that

<footnote confidence="0.8666005">
7An exception is Daum´e III and Marcu (2005), whose
model jointly learns to extract NPs and perform coreference.
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.999841965517242">
these three extraction methods typically produce
different numbers of NPs: the NPs extracted from
a parser tend to significantly outnumber the system
mentions, which in turn outnumber the gold NPs.
The reasons are two-fold. First, in some corefer-
ence corpora (e.g., MUC-6 and MUC-7), the NPs
that are not part of any coreference chain are not
annotated. Second, in corpora such as those pro-
duced by the ACE evaluations, only the NPs that
belong to one of the ACE entity types (e.g., PER-
SON, ORGANIZATION, LOCATION) are annotated.
Owing in large part to the difference in the num-
ber of NPs extracted by these three methods, a
coreference resolver can produce substantially dif-
ferent results when applied to the resulting three
sets of NPs, with gold NPs yielding the best results
and NPs extracted from a parser yielding the worst
(Nicolae and Nicolae, 2006). While researchers
who evaluate their resolvers on gold NPs point out
that the results can more accurately reflect the per-
formance of their coreference algorithm, Stoyanov
et al. (2009) argue that such evaluations are unre-
alistic, as NP extraction is an integral part of an
end-to-end fully-automatic resolver.
Whichever NP extraction method is employed,
it is clear that the use of gold NPs can considerably
simplify the coreference task, and hence resolvers
employing different extraction methods should not
be compared against each other.

5.2 Scoring a Coreference Partition
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99997865">
The MUC scorer (Vilain et al., 1995) is the first
program developed for scoring coreference parti-
tions. It has two often-cited weaknesses. As a link-
based measure, it does not reward correctly iden-
tified singleton clusters since there is no corefer-
ence link in these clusters. Also, it tends to under-
penalize partitions with overly large clusters.
To address these problems, two coreference
scoring programs have been developed: B3
(Bagga and Baldwin, 1998) and CEAF (Luo,
2005). Note that both scorers have only been de-
fined for the case where the key partition has the
same set of NPs as the response partition. To apply
these scorers to automatically extracted NPs, dif-
ferent methods have been proposed (see Rahman
and Ng (2009) and Stoyanov et al. (2009)).
Since coreference is a clustering task, any
general-purpose method for evaluating a response
partition against a key partition (e.g., Kappa (Car-
letta, 1996)) can be used for coreference scor-

<bodyText confidence="0.999824666666667">
ing (see Popescu-Belis et al. (2004)). In practice,
these general-purpose methods are typically used
to provide scores that complement those obtained
via the three coreference scorers discussed above.
It is worth mentioning that there is a trend to-
wards evaluating a resolver against multiple scor-
ers, which can indirectly help to counteract the
bias inherent in a particular scorer. For further dis-
cussion on evaluation issues, see Byron (2001).

6 Concluding Remarks
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999954797752809">
While we have focused our discussion on super-
vised approaches, coreference researchers have
also attempted to reduce a resolver’s reliance on
annotated data by combining a small amount of
labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled
data using general-purpose semi-supervised learn-
ing algorithms such as co-training (M¨uller et al.,
2002), self-training (Kehler et al., 2004a), and EM
(Cherry and Bergsma, 2005; Ng, 2008). Interest-
ingly, recent results indicate that unsupervised ap-
proaches to coreference resolution (e.g., Haghighi
and Klein (2007; 2010), Poon and Domingos
(2008)) rival their supervised counterparts, casting
doubts on whether supervised resolvers are mak-
ing effective use of the available labeled data.
Another issue that we have not focused on but
which is becoming increasingly important is mul-
tilinguality. While many of the techniques dis-
cussed in this paper were originally developed for
English, they have been applied to learn coref-
erence models for other languages, such as Chi-
nese (e.g., Converse (2006)), Japanese (e.g., Iida
(2007)), Arabic (e.g., Luo and Zitouni (2005)),
Dutch (e.g., Hoste (2005)), German (e.g., Wun-
sch (2010)), Swedish (e.g., Nilsson (2010)), and
Czech (e.g., Ngu.y et al. (2009)). In addition, re-
searchers have developed approaches that are tar-
geted at handling certain kinds of anaphora present
in non-English languages, such as zero anaphora
(e.g., Iida et al. (2007a), Zhao and Ng (2007)).
As Mitkov (2001) puts it, coreference resolution
is a “difficult, but not intractable problem,” and
we have been making “slow, but steady progress”
on improving machine learning approaches to the
problem in the past fifteen years. To ensure fur-
ther progress, researchers should compare their re-
sults against a baseline that is stronger than the
commonly-used Soon et al. (2001) system, which
relies on a weak model (i.e., the mention-pair
model) and a small set of linguistic features. As re-
cent systems are becoming more sophisticated, we
suggest that researchers make their systems pub-
licly available in order to facilitate performance
comparisons. Publicly available coreference sys-
tems currently include JavaRAP (Qiu et al., 2004),
GuiTaR (Poesio and Kabadjov, 2004), BART (Ver-
sley et al., 2008b), CoRTex (Denis and Baldridge,
2008), the Illinois Coreference Package (Bengt-
son and Roth, 2008), CherryPicker (Rahman and
Ng, 2009), Reconcile (Stoyanov et al., 2010), and
Charniak and Elsner’s (2009) pronoun resolver.
We conclude with a discussion of two ques-
tions regarding supervised coreference research.
First, what is the state of the art? This is not an
easy question, as researchers have been evaluat-
ing their resolvers on different corpora using dif-
ferent evaluation metrics and preprocessing tools.
In particular, preprocessing tools can have a large
impact on the performance of a resolver (Barbu
and Mitkov, 2001). Worse still, assumptions about
whether gold or automatically extracted NPs are
used are sometimes not explicitly stated, poten-
tially causing results to be interpreted incorrectly.
To our knowledge, however, the best results on the
MUC-6 and MUC-7 data sets using automatically
extracted NPs are reported by Yang et al. (2003)
(71.3 MUC F-score) and Ng and Cardie (2002c)
(63.4 MUC F-score), respectively;8 and the best
results on the ACE data sets using gold NPs can
be found in Luo (2007) (88.4 ACE-value).
Second, what lessons can we learn from fifteen
years of learning-based coreference research?
The mention-pair model is weak because it makes
coreference decisions based on local informa-
tion (i.e., information extracted from two NPs).
Expressive models (e.g., those that can exploit
cluster-level features) generally offer better perfor-
mance, and so are models that are “global” in na-
ture. Global coreference models may refer to any
kind of models that can exploit non-local infor-
mation, including models that can consider mul-
tiple candidate antecedents simultaneously (e.g.,
ranking models), models that allow joint learning
for coreference resolution and related tasks (e.g.,
anaphoricity determination), models that can di-
rectly optimize clustering-level (rather than classi-
fication) accuracy, and models that can coordinate
with other components of a resolver, such as train-
ing instance creation and clustering.

been made since 2003: most of the recently proposed coref-
erence models were evaluated on the ACE data sets.

(2004b; 2008a) also investigate the entity-mention model, which produces results that are only marginally better than those of the mention-pair model. However, it appears that they are not fully exploiting the expressiveness of the entity-mention model, as cluster-level features only comprise a small fraction of their features. Variants of the entity-mention model have been investigated. For example, Culotta et al. (2007) present a first-order logic model that determines 1400 the probability that an arbitrary set of NPs are all co-referring. Their model resembles the entitymention model in that it enables the use of clusterlevel features. Daum´e III and Marcu (2005) propose an online learning model for constructing coreference chains in an incremental fashion, allowing later coreference decisions to be made by exploiting cluster-level features that are computed over the coreference chains created thus far. 3.3 Ranking Models While the entity-mention model addresses the expressiveness problem with the mention-p</context>

For example, coreferent NPs have to agree in number and gender and cannot span one another (e.g., “Google” and “Google employees”). There are also features that encode general linguistic preferences either for or against coreference. For example, an indefinite NP (that is not in apposition to an anaphoric NP) is not likely to be coreferent with any NP that precedes it. There has been an increasing amount of work on investigating semantic features for coreference resolution. One of the earliest kinds of semantic knowledge employed for coreference resolution is perhaps selectional preference (Dagan and Itai, 1990; Kehler et al., 2004b; Yang et al., 2005; Haghighi and Klein, 2009): given a pronoun to be resolved, its governing verb, and its grammatical role, we prefer a candidate antecedent that can be governed by the same verb and be in the same role. Semantic knowledge has also been extracted from WordNet and unannotated corpora for computing the semantic compatibility/similarity between two common nouns (Harabagiu et al., 2001; Versley, 2007) as well as the semantic class of a noun (Ng, 2007a; Huang et al., 2009).

Cluster rankers are conceptually similar to Lappin and Leass’s (1994) heuristic pronoun resolver, which resolves an anaphoric pronoun to the most salient preceding cluster. An important issue with ranking models that we have eluded so far concerns the identification of non-anaphoric NPs. As a ranker simply imposes a ranking on candidate antecedents or preceding clusters, it cannot determine whether an NP is anaphoric (and hence should be resolved). To address this problem, Denis and Baldridge (2008) apply an independently trained anaphoricity classifier to identify non-anaphoric NPs prior to ranking, and Rahman and Ng (2009) propose a model that jointly learns coreference and anaphoricity. 4 Knowledge Sources Another thread of supervised coreference research concerns the development of linguistic features. Below we give an overview of these features. String-matching features can be computed robustly and typically contribute a lot to the performance of a coreference system. Besides simple string-matching operations such as exact string match, substring match, and head noun match for diffe</context>

To ensure further progress, researchers should compare their results against a baseline that is stronger than the commonly-used Soon et al. (2001) system, which relies on a weak model (i.e., the mention-pair model) and a small set of linguistic features. As recent systems are becoming more sophisticated, we suggest that researchers make their systems publicly available in order to facilitate performance comparisons. Publicly available coreference systems currently include JavaRAP (Qiu et al., 2004), GuiTaR (Poesio and Kabadjov, 2004), BART (Versley et al., 2008b), CoRTex (Denis and Baldridge, 2008), the Illinois Coreference Package (Bengtson and Roth, 2008), CherryPicker (Rahman and Ng, 2009), Reconcile (Stoyanov et al., 2010), and Charniak and Elsner’s (2009) pronoun resolver. We conclude with a discussion of two questions regarding supervised coreference research. First, what is the state of the art? This is not an easy question, as researchers have been evaluating their resolvers on different corpora using different evaluation metrics and preprocessing tools. In particular, preprocessing tools can have a large impact on the performance of a resolver (Barbu and Mitkov, 2001). Worse st</context>

Hence, knowledge of the anaphoricity of an NP can potentially improve the precision of a coreference resolver. Traditionally, the task of anaphoricity determination has been tackled independently of coreference resolution using a variety of techniques. For example, pleonastic it has been identified using heuristic approaches (e.g., Paice and Husk (1987), Lappin and Leass (1994), Kennedy and Boguraev (1996)), supervised approaches (e.g., Evans (2001), M¨uller (2006), Versley et al.

The more frequently the pattern occurs, the more likely they are coreferent. This technique has been applied to resolve different kinds of anaphoric references, including other-anaphora (Modjeska et al., 2003; Markert and Nissim, 2005) and bridging references (Poesio et al., 2004a). While these patterns are typically hand-crafted (e.g., Garera and Yarowsky (2006)), they can also be learned from an annotated corpus (Yang and Su, 2007) or bootstrapped from an unannotated corpus (Bean and Riloff, 2004). Despite the large amount of work on discoursebased anaphora resolution in the 1970s and 1980s (see Hirst (1981)), learning-based resolvers have only exploited shallow discourse-based features, which primarily involve characterizing the salience of a candidate antecedent by measuring its distance from the anaphoric NP to be resolved or determining whether it is in a prominent grammatical role (e.g., subject).

Interestingly, recent results indicate that unsupervised approaches to coreference resolution (e.g., Haghighi and Klein (2007; 2010), Poon and Domingos (2008)) rival their supervised counterparts, casting doubts on whether supervised resolvers are making effective use of the available labeled data. Another issue that we have not focused on but which is becoming increasingly important is multilinguality. While many of the techniques discussed in this paper were originally developed for English, they have been applied to learn coreference models for other languages, such as Chinese (e.g., Converse (2006)), Japanese (e.g., Iida (2007)), Arabic (e.g., Luo and Zitouni (2005)), Dutch (e.g., Hoste (2005)), German (e.g., Wu</context>

There are also features that encode general linguistic preferences either for or against coreference. For example, an indefinite NP (that is not in apposition to an anaphoric NP) is not likely to be coreferent with any NP that precedes it. There has been an increasing amount of work on investigating semantic features for coreference resolution. One of the earliest kinds of semantic knowledge employed for coreference resolution is perhaps selectional preference (Dagan and Itai, 1990; Kehler et al., 2004b; Yang et al., 2005; Haghighi and Klein, 2009): given a pronoun to be resolved, its governing verb, and its grammatical role, we prefer a candidate antecedent that can be governed by the same verb and be in the same role. Semantic knowledge has also been extracted from WordNet and unannotated corpora for computing the semantic compatibility/similarity between two common nouns (Harabagiu et al., 2001; Versley, 2007) as well as the semantic class of a noun (Ng, 2007a; Huang et al., 2009).

Lexico-syntactic patterns have been used to capture the semantic relatedness between two NPs and hence the likelihood that they are coreferent. For instance, given the pattern X is a Y (which is highly indicative that X and Y are coreferent), we can instantiate it with a pair of NPs and search for the instantiated pattern in a large corpus or the Web (Daum´e III and Marcu, 2005; Haghighi and Klein, 2009). The more frequently the pattern occurs, the more likely they are coreferent. This technique has been applied to resolve different kinds of anaphoric references, including other-anaphora (Modjeska et al., 2003; Markert and Nissim, 2005) and bridging references (Poesio et al., 2004a). While these patterns are typically hand-crafted (e.g., Garera and Yarowsky (2006)), they can also be learned from an annotated corpus (Yang and Su, 2007) or bootstrapped from an unannotated corpus (Bean and Riloff, 2004).

(2002), Yang et al. (2003)). While many instance creation methods are heuristic in nature (see Uryupina (2004) and Hoste and Daelemans (2005)), some are learning-based.

A notable exception 1402 is Iida et al. (2009), who train a ranker to rank the candidate antecedents for an anaphoric pronoun by their salience.

Some researchers simply use the first sense (Soon et al., 2001) or all possible senses (Ponzetto and Strube, 2006a), while others overcome this problem with word sense disambiguation (Nicolae and Nicolae, 2006). Knowledge has also been mined from Wikipedia for measuring the semantic relatedness of two NPs, NPj and NPk (Ponzetto and Strube (2006a; 2007)), such as: whether NPj/k appears in the first paragraph of the Wiki page that has NPk/j as the title or in the list of categor</context>

A notable exception 1402 is Iida et al. (2009), who train a ranker to rank the candidate antecedents for an anaphoric pronoun by their salience. It is worth noting that Tetreault (2005) has employed Grosz and Sidner’s (1986) discourse theory and Veins Theory (Ide and Cristea, 2000) to identify and remove candidate antecedents that are not referentially accessible to an anaphoric pronoun in his heuristic pronoun resolvers. It would be interesting to incorporate this idea into a learning-based resolver. There are also features that do not fall into any of the preceding categories. For example, a memorization feature is a word pair composed of the head nouns of the two NPs involved in an instance (Bengtson and Roth, 2008). Memorization features have been used as binary-valued features indicating the presence or absence of their words (Luo et al., 2004) or as probabilistic </context>

(1998)). Ranking is first applied to learning-based coreference resolution by Connolly et al. (1994; 1997), where a model is trained to rank two candidate antecedents. Each training instance corresponds to the NP to be resolved, NP/,, as well as two candidate antecedents, NP� and NPj, one of which is an antecedent of NP,, and the other is not. Its class value indicates which of the two candidates is better. This model is referred to as the tournament model by Iida et al. (2003) and the twin-candidate model by Yang et al. (2003; 2008b). To resolve an NP during testing, one way is to apply the model to each pair of its candidate antecedents, and the candidate that is classified as better the largest number of times is selected as its antecedent. Advances in machine learning have made it possible to train a mention ranker that ranks all of the candidate antecedents simultaneously. While mention rankers have consistently outperformed the mention-pair model (Versley, 2006; Denis and Baldridge, 2007b), they are not more expressive than the mention-pair model, as they are </context>

Luo and Zitouni (2005) extract features from a parse tree for implementing Binding Constraints (Chomsky, 1988). Given an automatically parsed corpus, Bergsma and Lin (2006) extract from each parse tree a dependency path, which is represented as a sequence of nodes and dependency labels connecting a pronoun and a candidate antecedent, and collect statistical information from these paths to determine the likelihood that a pronoun and a candidate antecedent connected by a given path are coreferent. Rather than deriving features from parse trees, Iida et al. (2006) and Yang et al. (2006) employ these trees directly as structured features for pronoun resolution. Specifically, Yang et al. define tree kernels for efficiently computing the similarity between two parse trees, and Iida et al. use a boosting-based algorithm to compute the usefulness of a subtree. Grammatical features encode the grammatical properties of one or both NPs involved in an instance. For example, Ng and Cardie’s (2002c) resolver employs 34 grammatical features. Some features determine NP type (e.g., are both NPs definite or pronouns?). Some determine the grammatical role of one or bo</context>

While many of the techniques discussed in this paper were originally developed for English, they have been applied to learn coreference models for other languages, such as Chinese (e.g., Converse (2006)), Japanese (e.g., Iida (2007)), Arabic (e.g., Luo and Zitouni (2005)), Dutch (e.g., Hoste (2005)), German (e.g., Wunsch (2010)), Swedish (e.g., Nilsson (2010)), and Czech (e.g., Ngu.y et al.

Other commonly-used logical predicates for creating cluster-level features include relaxed versions of the ALL predicate, such as MOST, which is true if NPk agrees in number with more than half of the NPs in Cj, and ANY, which is true as long as NPk agrees in number with just one of the NPs in Cj. The ability of the entity-mention model to employ cluster-level features makes it more expressive than its mention-pair counterpart. Despite its improved expressiveness, the entitymention model has not yielded particularly encouraging results. For example, Luo et al. (2004) apply the ANY predicate to generate cluster-level features for their entity-mention model, which does not perform as well as the mention-pair model. Yang et al. (2004b; 2008a) also investigate the entity-mention model, which produces results that are only marginally better than those of the mention-pair model. However, it appears that they are not fully exploiting the expressiveness of the entity-mention model, as cluster-level features only comprise a small fraction of their features.

It would be interesting to incorporate this idea into a learning-based resolver. There are also features that do not fall into any of the preceding categories. For example, a memorization feature is a word pair composed of the head nouns of the two NPs involved in an instance (Bengtson and Roth, 2008). Memorization features have been used as binary-valued features indicating the presence or absence of their words (Luo et al., 2004) or as probabilistic features indicating the probability that the two heads are coreferent according to the training data (Ng, 2007b). An anaphoricity feature indicates whether an NP to be resolved is anaphoric, and is typically computed using an anaphoricity classifier (Ng, 2004), hand-crafted patterns (Daum´e III and Marcu, 2005), and automatically acquired patterns (Bean and Riloff, 1999).

It has two often-cited weaknesses. As a linkbased measure, it does not reward correctly identified singleton clusters since there is no coreference link in these clusters. Also, it tends to underpenalize partitions with overly large clusters. To address these problems, two coreference scoring programs have been developed: B3 (Bagga and Baldwin, 1998) and CEAF (Luo, 2005). Note that both scorers have only been defined for the case where the key partition has the same set of NPs as the response partition. To apply these scorers to automatically extracted NPs, different methods have been proposed (see Rahman and Ng (2009) and Stoyanov et al. (2009)). Since coreference is a clustering task, any general-purpose method for evaluating a response partition against a key partition (e.g., Kappa (Carletta, 1996)) can be used for coreference scor1403 ing (see Popescu-Belis et al.

In particular, preprocessing tools can have a large impact on the performance of a resolver (Barbu and Mitkov, 2001). Worse still, assumptions about whether gold or automatically extracted NPs are used are sometimes not explicitly stated, potentially causing results to be interpreted incorrectly. To our knowledge, however, the best results on the MUC-6 and MUC-7 data sets using automatically extracted NPs are reported by Yang et al. (2003) (71.3 MUC F-score) and Ng and Cardie (2002c) (63.4 MUC F-score), respectively;8 and the best results on the ACE data sets using gold NPs can be found in Luo (2007) (88.4 ACE-value). Second, what lessons can we learn from fifteen years of learning-based coreference research? The mention-pair model is weak because it makes coreference decisions based on local information (i.e., information extracted from two NPs). Expressive models (e.g., those that can exploit cluster-level features) generally offer better performance, and so are models that are “global” in nature. Global coreference models may refer to any kind of models that can exploit non-local information, including models that can consider multiple candidate antecedents simultaneously (e.g., rankin</context>

To motivate the entity-mention model, consider an example taken from McCallum and Wellner (2003), where a document consists of three NPs: “Mr. Clinton,” “Clinton,” and “she.” The mentionpair model may determine that “Mr. Clinton” and “Clinton” are coreferent using string-matching features, and that “Clinton” and “she” are coreferent based on proximity and lack of evidence for gender and number disagreement. However, these two pairwise decisions together with transitivity imply that “Mr. Clinton” and “she” will end up in the same cluster, which is incorrect due to gender mismatch. This kind of error arises in part because the later coreference decisions are not dependent on the earlier on</context>

Moreover, positive pairwise decisions are unjustifiably favored over their negative counterparts. For example, three NPs are likely to end up in the same cluster in the resulting partition even if there is strong evidence that A and C are not coreferent, as long as the other two pairs (i.e., (A,B) and (B,C)) are classified as positive. Several algorithms that address one or both of these problems have been used for coreference clustering. Correlation clustering (Bansal et al., 2002), which produces a partition that respects as many pairwise decisions as possible, is used by McCallum and Wellner (2004), Zelenko et al. (2004), and Finley and Joachims (2005). Graph partitioning algorithms are applied on a weighted, undirected graph where a vertex corresponds to an NP and an edge is weighted by the pairwise coreference scores between two NPs (e.g., McCallum and Wellner (2004), Nicolae and Nico4If a probabilistic model is used, we can define a threshold above which a pair of NPs is considered coreferent. 1398 lae (2006)).

Since the classification model is trained independently of the clustering algorithm, improvements in classification accuracy do not guarantee corresponding improvements in clustering-level accuracy.

It was first proposed by Aone and Bennett (1995) and McCarthy and Lehnert (1995), and is one of the most influential learning-based coreference models. Despite its popularity, this binary classification approach to coreference is somewhat undesirable: the transitivity property inherent in the coreference relation cannot be enforced, as it is possible for the model to determine that A and B are coreferent, B and C are coreferent, but A and C are not coreferent. Hence, a separate clustering mechanism is needed to coordinate the pairwise classification decisions made by the model and construct a coreference partition.

As Mitkov (2001) puts it, coreference resolution is a “difficult, but not intractable problem,” and we have been making “slow, but steady progress” on improving machine learning approaches to the problem in the past fifteen years. To ensure further progress, researchers should compare their results against a baseline that is stronger than the commonly-used Soon et al.

We conclude with a discussion of two questions regarding supervised coreference research. First, what is the state of the art? This is not an easy question, as researchers have been evaluating their resolvers on different corpora using different evaluation metrics and preprocessing tools. In particular, preprocessing tools can have a large impact on the performance of a resolver (Barbu and Mitkov, 2001). Worse still, assumptions about whether gold or automatically extracted NPs are used are sometimes not explicitly stated, potentially causing results to be interpreted incorrectly.

Lexico-syntactic patterns have been used to capture the semantic relatedness between two NPs and hence the likelihood that they are coreferent. For instance, given the pattern X is a Y (which is highly indicative that X and Y are coreferent), we can instantiate it with a pair of NPs and search for the instantiated pattern in a large corpus or the Web (Daum´e III and Marcu, 2005; Haghighi and Klein, 2009). The more frequently the pattern occurs, the more likely they are coreferent. This technique has been applied to resolve different kinds of anaphoric references, including other-anaphora (Modjeska et al., 2003; Markert and Nissim, 2005) and bridging references (Poesio et al., 2004a). While these patterns are typically hand-crafted (e.g., Garera and Yarowsky (2006)), they can also be learned from an annotated corpus (Yang and Su, 2007) or bootstrapped from an unannotated corpus (Bean and Riloff, 2004). Despite the large amount of work on discoursebased anaphora resolution in the 1970s and 1980s (see Hirst (1981)), learning-based resolvers have only exploited shallow discourse-based features, which primarily involve characterizing the salience of a candidate antecedent by measuring its distance from </context>

Despite its simple task definition, coreference is generally considered a difficult NLP task, typically involving the use of sophisticated knowledge sources and inference procedures (Charniak, 1972). Computational theories of discourse, in particular focusing (see Grosz (1977) and Sidner (1979)) and centering (Grosz et al. (1983; 1995)), have heavily influenced coreference research in the 1970s and 1980s, leading to the development of numerous centering algorithms (see Walker et al. (1998)). The focus of coreference research underwent a gradual shift from heuristic approaches to machine learning approaches in the 1990s. This shift can be attributed in part to the advent of the statistical NLP era, and in part to the public availability of annotated coreference corpora produced as part of the MUC-6 (1995) and MUC-7 (1998) conferences.

Given 1397 an anaphoric noun phrase3, NPk, Soon et al.’s method creates a positive instance between NPk and its closest preceding antecedent, NPj, and a negative instance by pairing NPk with each of the intervening NPs, NPj+1, ..., NPk−1.

This modification is motivated by the observation that it is not easy for a human, let alone a machine learner, to learn from a positive instance where the antecedent of a non-pronominal NP is a pronoun.

Below we describe some commonly used coreference clustering algorithms. Despite their simplicity, closest-first clustering (Soon et al., 2001) and best-first clustering (Ng and Cardie, 2002c) are arguably the most widely used coreference clustering algorithms. The closest-first clustering algorithm selects as the antecedent for an NP, NPk, the closest preceding noun phrase that is classified as coreferent with it.4 However, if no such preceding noun phrase exists, no antecedent is selected for NPk.

The search starts at the root, and a partitioning of the NPs is incrementally constructed as we move down the tree. Specifically, based on the coreference decisions it has made in the first i−1 levels of the tree, the algorithm determines at the ith level whether the ith NP should start a new cluster, or to which preceding cluster it should be assigned. While many coreference clustering algorithms have been developed, there have only been a few attempts to compare their effectiveness. For example, Ng and Cardie (2002c) report that bestfirst clustering is better than closest-first clustering. Nicolae and Nicolae (2006) show that bestfirst clustering performs similarly to Bell-treebased clustering, but neither of these algorithms 5When applying closest-first and best-first clustering, Soon et al.

Recently, anaphoricity determination has been evaluated in the context of coreference resolution, with results showing that training an anaphoricity classifier to identify and filter non-anaphoric NPs prior to coreference resolution can improve a learning-based resolver (e.g., Ng and Cardie (2002b), Uryupina (2003), Poesio et al.

Compared to earlier work on anaphoricity determination, recently proposed approaches are more “global” in nature, taking into account the pairwise decisions made by the mention-pair model when making anaphoricity decisions.

Finally, the outputs of rule-based pronoun and coreference resolvers have also been used as features for learning-based coreference resolution (Ng and Cardie, 2002c). For an empirical evaluation of the contribution of a subset of these features to the mention-pair model, see Bengtson and Roth (2008). 5 Evaluation Issues Two important issues surround the evaluation of a coreference resolver. First, how do we obtain the set of NPs that a resolver will partition? Second, how do we score the partition it produces? 5.1 Extracting Candidate Noun Phrases To obtain the set of NPs to be partitioned by a resolver, three methods are typically used.

Many heuristic instance creation methods have been proposed, among which Soon et al.’s (1999; 2001) is arguably the most popular choice. Given 1397 an anaphoric noun phrase3, NPk, Soon et al.’s method creates a positive instance between NPk and its closest preceding antecedent, NPj, and a negative instance by pairing NPk with each of the intervening NPs, NPj+1, ..., NPk−1. With an eye towards improving the precision of a coreference resolver, Ng and Cardie (2002c) propose an instance creation method that involves a single modification to Soon et al.’s method: if NPk is non-pronominal, a positive instance should be formed between NPk and its closest preceding nonpronominal antecedent instead. This modification is motivated by the observation that it is not easy for a human, let alone a machine learner, to learn from a positive instance where the antecedent of a non-pronominal NP is a pronoun.

Interestingly, recent results indicate that unsupervised approaches to coreference resolution (e.g., Haghighi and Klein (2007; 2010), Poon and Domingos (2008)) rival their supervised counterparts, casting doubts on whether supervised resolvers are making effective use of the available labeled data. Another issue that we have not focused on but which is becoming increasingly important is multilinguality.

While mention rankers have consistently outperformed the mention-pair model (Versley, 2006; Denis and Baldridge, 2007b), they are not more expressive than the mention-pair model, as they are unable to exploit cluster-level features, unlike the entitymention model. To enable rankers to employ cluster-level features, Rahman and Ng (2009) propose the cluster-ranking model, which ranks preceding clusters, rather than candidate antecedents, for an NP to be resolved. Cluster rankers therefore address both weaknesses of the mention-pair model, and have been shown to improve mention rankers. Cluster rankers are conceptually similar to Lappin and Leass’s (1994) heuristic pronoun resolver, which resolves an anaphoric pronoun to the most salient preceding cluster. An important issue with ranking models that we have eluded so far concerns the identification of non-anaphoric NPs. As a ranker simply imposes a ranking on candidate anteced</context>

As a linkbased measure, it does not reward correctly identified singleton clusters since there is no coreference link in these clusters. Also, it tends to underpenalize partitions with overly large clusters. To address these problems, two coreference scoring programs have been developed: B3 (Bagga and Baldwin, 1998) and CEAF (Luo, 2005). Note that both scorers have only been defined for the case where the key partition has the same set of NPs as the response partition. To apply these scorers to automatically extracted NPs, different methods have been proposed (see Rahman and Ng (2009) and Stoyanov et al. (2009)). Since coreference is a clustering task, any general-purpose method for evaluating a response partition against a key partition (e.g., Kappa (Carletta, 1996)) can be used for coreference scor1403 ing (see Popescu-Belis et al. (2004)). In practice, these general-purpose methods are typically used to provide scores that complement those obtained via the three coreference scorers discussed above. It is worth mentioning that there is a trend towards evaluating a resolver against multiple scorers, which can indirectly help to counteract the bias inherent in a particular</context>

(2001) system, which relies on a weak model (i.e., the mention-pair model) and a small set of linguistic features. As recent systems are becoming more sophisticated, we suggest that researchers make their systems publicly available in order to facilitate performance comparisons. Publicly available coreference systems currently include JavaRAP (Qiu et al., 2004), GuiTaR (Poesio and Kabadjov, 2004), BART (Versley et al., 2008b), CoRTex (Denis and Baldridge, 2008), the Illinois Coreference Package (Bengtson and Roth, 2008), CherryPicker (Rahman and Ng, 2009), Reconcile (Stoyanov et al., 2010), and Charniak and Elsner’s (2009) pronoun resolver. We conclude with a discussion of two questions regarding supervised coreference research. First, what is the state of the art? This is not an easy question, as researchers have been evaluating their resolvers on different corpora using different evaluation metrics and preprocessing tools. In particular, preprocessing tools can have a large impact on the performance of a resolver (Barbu and Mitkov, 2001).

Specifically, based on the coreference decisions it has made in the first i−1 levels of the tree, the algorithm determines at the ith level whether the ith NP should start a new cluster, or to which preceding cluster it should be assigned. While many coreference clustering algorithms have been developed, there have only been a few attempts to compare their effectiveness. For example, Ng and Cardie (2002c) report that bestfirst clustering is better than closest-first clustering. Nicolae and Nicolae (2006) show that bestfirst clustering performs similarly to Bell-treebased clustering, but neither of these algorithms 5When applying closest-first and best-first clustering, Soon et al.

Semantic knowledge has also been extracted from WordNet and unannotated corpora for computing the semantic compatibility/similarity between two common nouns (Harabagiu et al., 2001; Versley, 2007) as well as the semantic class of a noun (Ng, 2007a; Huang et al., 2009). One difficulty with deriving knowledge from WordNet is that one has to determine which sense of a given word to use. Some researchers simply use the first sense (Soon et al., 2001) or all possible senses (Ponzetto and Strube, 2006a), while others overcome this problem with word sense disambiguation (Nicolae and Nicolae, 2006). Knowledge has also been mined from Wikipedia for measuring the semantic relatedness of two NPs, NPj and NPk (Ponzetto and Strube (2006a; 2007)), such as: whether NPj/k appears in the first paragraph of the Wiki page that has NPk/j as the title or in the list of categories to which this page belongs, and the degree of overlap between the two pages that have the two NPs as their titles (see Poesio et al.

Second, in corpora such as those produced by the ACE evaluations, only the NPs that belong to one of the ACE entity types (e.g., PERSON, ORGANIZATION, LOCATION) are annotated. Owing in large part to the difference in the number of NPs extracted by these three methods, a coreference resolver can produce substantially different results when applied to the resulting three sets of NPs, with gold NPs yielding the best results and NPs extracted from a parser yielding the worst (Nicolae and Nicolae, 2006). While researchers who evaluate their resolvers on gold NPs point out that the results can more accurately reflect the performance of their coreference algorithm, Stoyanov et al. (2009) argue that such evaluations are unrealistic, as NP extraction is an integral part of an end-to-end fully-automatic resolver. Whichever NP extraction method is employed, it is clear that the use of gold NPs can considerably simplify the coreference task, and hence resolvers employing different extraction methods should not be compared against each other. 5.2 Scoring a Coreference Partition The MUC scorer (Vilai</context>

Another issue that we have not focused on but which is becoming increasingly important is multilinguality. While many of the techniques discussed in this paper were originally developed for English, they have been applied to learn coreference models for other languages, such as Chinese (e.g., Converse (2006)), Japanese (e.g., Iida (2007)), Arabic (e.g., Luo and Zitouni (2005)), Dutch (e.g., Hoste (2005)), German (e.g., Wunsch (2010)), Swedish (e.g., Nilsson (2010)), and Czech (e.g., Ngu.y et al. (2009)). In addition, researchers have developed approaches that are targeted at handling certain kinds of anaphora present in non-English languages, such as zero anaphora (e.g., Iida et al. (2007a), Zhao and Ng (2007)). As Mitkov (2001) puts it, coreference resolution is a “difficult, but not intractable problem,” and we have been making “slow, but steady progress” on improving machine learning approaches to the problem in the past fifteen years.

Hence, knowledge of the anaphoricity of an NP can potentially improve the precision of a coreference resolver. Traditionally, the task of anaphoricity determination has been tackled independently of coreference resolution using a variety of techniques. For example, pleonastic it has been identified using heuristic approaches (e.g., Paice and Husk (1987), Lappin and Leass (1994), Kennedy and Boguraev (1996)), supervised approaches (e.g., Evans (2001), M¨uller (2006), Versley et al.

Our goal in this paper is to provide NLP researchers with a survey of the major milestones in supervised coreference research, focusing on the computational models, the linguistic features, the annotated corpora, and the evaluation metrics that were developed in the past fifteen years. Note that several leading coreference researchers have published books (e.g., Mitkov (2002)), written survey articles (e.g., Mitkov (1999), Strube (2009)), and delivered tutorials (e.g., Strube (2002), Ponzetto and Poesio (2009)) that provide a broad overview of coreference research. This survey paper aims to complement, rather than supersede, these previously published materials. In particular, while existing survey papers discuss learning-based coreference research primarily in the context of the influential mention-pair model, we additionally survey recently proposed learning-based coreference models, which attempt to address the weaknesses of the mention-pair model. Due to space limitations, however, we will restrict our discussion to the most commonly investigated kind of coreference relation: the identity relat</context>

Interestingly, recent results indicate that unsupervised approaches to coreference resolution (e.g., Haghighi and Klein (2007; 2010), Poon and Domingos (2008)) rival their supervised counterparts, casting doubts on whether supervised resolvers are making effective use of the available labeled data. Another issue that we have not focused on but which is becoming increasingly important is multilinguality. While many of the techniques discussed in this paper were originally developed for English, they have been applied to learn coreference models for other languages, such as Chinese (e.g., Converse (2006)), Japanese (e.g., Iida (2007)), Arabic (e.g., Luo and Zitouni (2005)), Dutch (e.g., Hoste (2005)), German (e.g., Wunsch (2010)), Swedish (e.g., Nils</context>

(2001)), Ng and Cardie (2002a) present a method for mining easy positive instances, in an attempt to avoid the inclusion of hard training instances that may complicate the acquisition of an accurate coreference model. 3.1.2 Training a Coreference Classifier Once a training set is created, we can train a coreference model using an off-the-shelf learning algorithm. Decision tree induction systems (e.g., C5 (Quinlan, 1993)) are the first and one of the most widely used learning algorithms by coreference researchers, although rule learners (e.g., RIPPER (Cohen, 1995)) and memory-based learners (e.g., TiMBL (Daelemans and Van den Bosch, 2005)) are also popular choices, especially in early applications of machine learning to coreference resolution. In recent years, statistical learners such as maximum entropy models (Berger et al., 1996), voted perceptrons (Freund and Schapire, 1999), 3In this paper, we use the term anaphoric to describe any NP that is part of a coreference chain but is not the head of the chain. </context>

Advances in machine learning have made it possible to train a mention ranker that ranks all of the candidate antecedents simultaneously. While mention rankers have consistently outperformed the mention-pair model (Versley, 2006; Denis and Baldridge, 2007b), they are not more expressive than the mention-pair model, as they are unable to exploit cluster-level features, unlike the entitymention model. To enable rankers to employ cluster-level features, Rahman and Ng (2009) propose the cluster-ranking model, which ranks preceding clusters, rather than candidate antecedents, for an NP to be resolved. Cluster rankers therefore address both weaknesses of the mention-pair model, and have been shown to improve mention rankers. Cluster rankers are conceptually similar to Lappin and Leass’s (1994) heuristic pronoun resolver, which resolves an anaphoric pronoun to the most salient preceding cluster. An important issue with ranking models that we have eluded so far concerns the identification of non-anaphoric NPs. As a ranker simply imposes a ranking on candidate anteced</context>

Despite its simple task definition, coreference is generally considered a difficult NLP task, typically involving the use of sophisticated knowledge sources and inference procedures (Charniak, 1972). Computational theories of discourse, in particular focusing (see Grosz (1977) and Sidner (1979)) and centering (Grosz et al. (1983; 1995)), have heavily influenced coreference research in the 1970s and 1980s, leading to the development of numerous centering algorithms (see Walker et al. (1998)). The focus of coreference research underwent a gradual shift from heuristic approaches to machine learning approaches in the 1990s. This shift can be attributed in part to the advent of the statistical NLP era, and in part to the public availability of annotated coreference corpora produced as part of the MUC-6 (1995) and MUC-7 (1998) conferences.

Below we describe some commonly used coreference clustering algorithms. Despite their simplicity, closest-first clustering (Soon et al., 2001) and best-first clustering (Ng and Cardie, 2002c) are arguably the most widely used coreference clustering algorithms. The closest-first clustering algorithm selects as the antecedent for an NP, NPk, the closest preceding noun phrase that is classified as coreferent with it.4 However, if no such preceding noun phrase exists, no antecedent is selected for NPk. The best-first clustering algorithm aims to improve the precision of closest-first clustering, specifically by selecting as the antecedent of NPk the most probable preceding NP that is classified as coreferent with it.

While many coreference clustering algorithms have been developed, there have only been a few attempts to compare their effectiveness. For example, Ng and Cardie (2002c) report that bestfirst clustering is better than closest-first clustering. Nicolae and Nicolae (2006) show that bestfirst clustering performs similarly to Bell-treebased clustering, but neither of these algorithms 5When applying closest-first and best-first clustering, Soon et al. (2001) and Ng and Cardie (2002c) also process the NPs in a sequential manner, but since the later decisions are not dependent on the earlier ones, the order in which the NPs are processed does not affect their clustering results. performs as well as their proposed minimum-cutbased graph partitioning algorithm. 3.1.4 Determining NP Anaphoricity While coreference clustering algorithms attempt to resolve each NP encountered in a document, only a subset of the NPs are anaphoric and therefore need to be resolved.

One difficulty with deriving knowledge from WordNet is that one has to determine which sense of a given word to use.

(2007a), Zhao and Ng (2007)). As Mitkov (2001) puts it, coreference resolution is a “difficult, but not intractable problem,” and we have been making “slow, but steady progress” on improving machine learning approaches to the problem in the past fifteen years. To ensure further progress, researchers should compare their results against a baseline that is stronger than the commonly-used Soon et al.

Owing in large part to the difference in the number of NPs extracted by these three methods, a coreference resolver can produce substantially different results when applied to the resulting three sets of NPs, with gold NPs yielding the best results and NPs extracted from a parser yielding the worst (Nicolae and Nicolae, 2006). While researchers who evaluate their resolvers on gold NPs point out that the results can more accurately reflect the performance of their coreference algorithm, Stoyanov et al. (2009) argue that such evaluations are unrealistic, as NP extraction is an integral part of an end-to-end fully-automatic resolver. Whichever NP extraction method is employed, it is clear that the use of gold NPs can considerably simplify the coreference task, and hence resolvers employing different extraction methods should not be compared against each other. 5.2 Scoring a Coreference Partition The MUC scorer (Vilain et al., 1995) is the first program developed for scoring coreference partitions.

Despite the large amount of work on discoursebased anaphora resolution in the 1970s and 1980s (see Hirst (1981)), learning-based resolvers have only exploited shallow discourse-based features, which primarily involve characterizing the salience of a candidate antecedent by measuring its distance from the anaphoric NP to be resolved or determining whether it is in a prominent grammatical role (e.g., subject). A notable exception 1402 is Iida et al. (2009), who train a ranker to rank the candidate antecedents for an anaphoric pronoun by their salience. It is worth noting that Tetreault (2005) has employed Grosz and Sidner’s (1986) discourse theory and Veins Theory (Ide and Cristea, 2000) to identify and remove candidate antecedents that are not referentially accessible to an anaphoric pronoun in his heuristic pronoun resolvers. It would be interesting to incorporate this idea into a learning-based resolver. There are also features that do not fall into any of the preceding categories. For example, a memorization feature is a word pair composed of the head nouns of the two NPs involved in an instance (Bengtson and Roth, 2008). Memorization features have been used as binary-valued f</context>

To further reduce class skewness, some researchers employ a filtering mechanism on top of an instance creation method, thereby disallowing the creation of training instances from NP pairs that are unlikely to be coreferent, such as NP pairs that violate gender and number agreement (e.g., Strube et al. (2002), Yang et al. (2003)). While many instance creation methods are heuristic in nature (see Uryupina (2004) and Hoste and Daelemans (2005)), some are learning-based. For example, motivated by the fact that some coreference relations are harder to identify than the others (see Harabagiu et al. (2001)), Ng and Cardie (2002a) present a method for mining easy positive instances, in an attempt to avoid the inclusion of hard training instances that may complicate the acquisition of an accurate coreference model. 3.1.2 Training a Coreference Classifier Once a training set is created, we can train a coreference model using an off-the-shelf learning algorithm.

This model is referred to as the tournament model by Iida et al. (2003) and the twin-candidate model by Yang et al. (2003; 2008b). To resolve an NP during testing, one way is to apply the model to each pair of its candidate antecedents, and the candidate that is classified as better the largest number of times is selected as its antecedent. Advances in machine learning have made it possible to train a mention ranker that ranks all of the candidate antecedents simultaneously. While mention rankers have consistently outperformed the mention-pair model (Versley, 2006; Denis and Baldridge, 2007b), they are not more expressive than the mention-pair model, as they are unable to exploit cluster-level features, unlike the entitymention model. To enable rankers to employ cluster-level features, Rahman and Ng (2009) propose the cluster-ranking model, which ranks preceding clusters, rather than candidate antecedents, for an NP to be resolved. Cluster rankers therefore address both weaknesses of the mention-pair model, and have been shown to improve mention rankers. Cluster rankers are conceptually similar to Lappin and Leass’s (1994) heuristic pronoun resolver, w</context>

One of the earliest kinds of semantic knowledge employed for coreference resolution is perhaps selectional preference (Dagan and Itai, 1990; Kehler et al., 2004b; Yang et al., 2005; Haghighi and Klein, 2009): given a pronoun to be resolved, its governing verb, and its grammatical role, we prefer a candidate antecedent that can be governed by the same verb and be in the same role. Semantic knowledge has also been extracted from WordNet and unannotated corpora for computing the semantic compatibility/similarity between two common nouns (Harabagiu et al., 2001; Versley, 2007) as well as the semantic class of a noun (Ng, 2007a; Huang et al., 2009). One difficulty with deriving knowledge from WordNet is that one has to determine which sense of a given word to use. Some researchers simply use the first sense (Soon et al., 2001) or all possible senses (Ponzetto and Strube, 2006a), while others overcome this problem with word sense disambiguation (Nicolae and Nicolae, 2006). Knowledge has also been mined from Wikipedia for measuring the semantic relatedness of two NPs, NPj and NPk (Ponzetto and Strube (2006a; 2007)), such as: whether NPj/k appears in the first paragrap</context>

For example, pleonastic it has been identified using heuristic approaches (e.g., Paice and Husk (1987), Lappin and Leass (1994), Kennedy and Boguraev (1996)), supervised approaches (e.g., Evans (2001), M¨uller (2006), Versley et al.

(2008)); and non-anaphoric definite descriptions have been identified using rule-based techniques (e.g., Vieira and Poesio (2000)) and unsupervised techniques (e.g., Bean and Riloff (1999)). Recently, anaphoricity determination has been evaluated in the context of coreference resolution, with results showing that training an anaphoricity classifier to identify and filter non-anaphoric NPs prior to coreference resolution can improve a learning-based resolver (e.g., Ng and Cardie (2002b), Uryupina (2003), Poesio et al.

While researchers who evaluate their resolvers on gold NPs point out that the results can more accurately reflect the performance of their coreference algorithm, Stoyanov et al. (2009) argue that such evaluations are unrealistic, as NP extraction is an integral part of an end-to-end fully-automatic resolver. Whichever NP extraction method is employed, it is clear that the use of gold NPs can considerably simplify the coreference task, and hence resolvers employing different extraction methods should not be compared against each other. 5.2 Scoring a Coreference Partition The MUC scorer (Vilain et al., 1995) is the first program developed for scoring coreference partitions. It has two often-cited weaknesses. As a linkbased measure, it does not reward correctly identified singleton clusters since there is no coreference link in these clusters. Also, it tends to underpenalize partitions with overly large clusters. To address these problems, two coreference scoring programs have been developed: B3 (Bagga and Baldwin, 1998) and CEAF (Luo, 2005). Note that both scorers have only been defined for the case where the key partition has the same set of NPs as the response partition. To apply these scorers </context>

Despite its simple task definition, coreference is generally considered a difficult NLP task, typically involving the use of sophisticated knowledge sources and inference procedures (Charniak, 1972). Computational theories of discourse, in particular focusing (see Grosz (1977) and Sidner (1979)) and centering (Grosz et al. (1983; 1995)), have heavily influenced coreference research in the 1970s and 1980s, leading to the development of numerous centering algorithms (see Walker et al. (1998)). The focus of coreference research underwent a gradual shift from heuristic approaches to machine learning approaches in the 1990s. This shift can be attributed in part to the advent of the statistical NLP era, and in part to the public availability of annotated coreference corpora produced as part of the MUC-6 (1995) and MUC-7 (1998) conferences. Learning-based coreference research has remained vibrant since then, with results regularly published not only in general NLP conferences, but also in specialized conferences (e.g., the biennial Discourse Anaphora and Anaphor Resolution Colloquium </context>

Another desirable consequence is that there exists a natural resolution strategy for a ranking approach: an anaphoric NP is resolved to the candidate antecedent that has the highest rank. This contrasts with classification-based approaches, where many clustering algorithms have been employed to coordinate the pairwise classification decisions, and it is still not clear which of them is the best. The notion of ranking candidate antecedents can be traced back to centering algorithms, many of which use grammatical roles to rank forwardlooking centers (see Walker et al. (1998)). Ranking is first applied to learning-based coreference resolution by Connolly et al. (1994; 1997), where a model is trained to rank two candidate antecedents. Each training instance corresponds to the NP to be resolved, NP/,, as well as two candidate antecedents, NP� and NPj, one of which is an antecedent of NP,, and the other is not. Its class value indicates which of the two candidates is better. This model is referred to as the tournament model by Iida et al. (2003) and the twin-candidate model by Yang et al. (2003; 2008b).

Another issue that we have not focused on but which is becoming increasingly important is multilinguality. While many of the techniques discussed in this paper were originally developed for English, they have been applied to learn coreference models for other languages, such as Chinese (e.g., Converse (2006)), Japanese (e.g., Iida (2007)), Arabic (e.g., Luo and Zitouni (2005)), Dutch (e.g., Hoste (2005)), German (e.g., Wunsch (2010)), Swedish (e.g., Nilsson (2010)), and Czech (e.g., Ngu.y et al.

As Mitkov (2001) puts it, coreference resolution is a “difficult, but not intractable problem,” and we have been making “slow, but steady progress” on improving machine learning approaches to the problem in the past fifteen years.

The more frequently the pattern occurs, the more likely they are coreferent. This technique has been applied to resolve different kinds of anaphoric references, including other-anaphora (Modjeska et al., 2003; Markert and Nissim, 2005) and bridging references (Poesio et al., 2004a). While these patterns are typically hand-crafted (e.g., Garera and Yarowsky (2006)), they can also be learned from an annotated corpus (Yang and Su, 2007) or bootstrapped from an unannotated corpus (Bean and Riloff, 2004). Despite the large amount of work on discoursebased anaphora resolution in the 1970s and 1980s (see Hirst (1981)), learning-based resolvers have only exploited shallow discourse-based features, which primarily involve characterizing the salience of a candidate antecedent by measuring its distance from the anaphoric NP to be resolved or determining whether it is in a prominent grammatical role (e.g., subject).

This modification is motivated by the observation that it is not easy for a human, let alone a machine learner, to learn from a positive instance where the antecedent of a non-pronominal NP is a pronoun. To further reduce class skewness, some researchers employ a filtering mechanism on top of an instance creation method, thereby disallowing the creation of training instances from NP pairs that are unlikely to be coreferent, such as NP pairs that violate gender and number agreement (e.g., Strube et al. (2002), Yang et al. (2003)). While many instance creation methods are heuristic in nature (see Uryupina (2004) and Hoste and Daelemans (2005)), some are learning-based. For example, motivated by the fact that some coreference relations are harder to identify than the others (see Harabagiu et al. (2001)), Ng and Cardie (2002a) present a method for mining easy positive instances, in an attempt to avoid the inclusion of hard training instances that may complicate the acquisition of an accurate coreference model. 3.1.2 Training a Coreference Classifier Once a training set is created, we can train a coreference model using </context>

Advances in machine learning have made it possible to train a mention ranker that ranks all of the candidate antecedents simultaneously.

This is not an easy question, as researchers have been evaluating their resolvers on different corpora using different evaluation metrics and preprocessing tools. In particular, preprocessing tools can have a large impact on the performance of a resolver (Barbu and Mitkov, 2001). Worse still, assumptions about whether gold or automatically extracted NPs are used are sometimes not explicitly stated, potentially causing results to be interpreted incorrectly. To our knowledge, however, the best results on the MUC-6 and MUC-7 data sets using automatically extracted NPs are reported by Yang et al. (2003) (71.3 MUC F-score) and Ng and Cardie (2002c) (63.4 MUC F-score), respectively;8 and the best results on the ACE data sets using gold NPs can be found in Luo (2007) (88.4 ACE-value). Second, what lessons can we learn from fifteen years of learning-based coreference research? The mention-pair model is weak because it makes coreference decisions based on local information (i.e., information extracted from two NPs). Expressive models (e.g., those that can exploit cluster-level features) generally offer better performance, and so are models that are “global” in nature. Global coreference models ma</context>

For example, an indefinite NP (that is not in apposition to an anaphoric NP) is not likely to be coreferent with any NP that precedes it. There has been an increasing amount of work on investigating semantic features for coreference resolution. One of the earliest kinds of semantic knowledge employed for coreference resolution is perhaps selectional preference (Dagan and Itai, 1990; Kehler et al., 2004b; Yang et al., 2005; Haghighi and Klein, 2009): given a pronoun to be resolved, its governing verb, and its grammatical role, we prefer a candidate antecedent that can be governed by the same verb and be in the same role. Semantic knowledge has also been extracted from WordNet and unannotated corpora for computing the semantic compatibility/similarity between two common nouns (Harabagiu et al., 2001; Versley, 2007) as well as the semantic class of a noun (Ng, 2007a; Huang et al., 2009).

Rather than deriving features from parse trees, Iida et al. (2006) and Yang et al. (2006) employ these trees directly as structured features for pronoun resolution. Specifically, Yang et al. define tree kernels for efficiently computing the similarity between two parse trees, and Iida et al. use a boosting-based algorithm to compute the usefulness of a subtree. Grammatical features encode the grammatical properties of one or both NPs involved in an instance. For example, Ng and Cardie’s (2002c) resolver employs 34 grammatical features.

Correlation clustering (Bansal et al., 2002), which produces a partition that respects as many pairwise decisions as possible, is used by McCallum and Wellner (2004), Zelenko et al. (2004), and Finley and Joachims (2005). Graph partitioning algorithms are applied on a weighted, undirected graph where a vertex corresponds to an NP and an edge is weighted by the pairwise coreference scores between two NPs (e.g., McCallum and Wellner (2004), Nicolae and Nico4If a probabilistic model is used, we can define a threshold above which a pair of NPs is considered coreferent. 1398 lae (2006)). The Dempster-Shafer rule (Dempster, 1968), which combines the positive and negative pairwise decisions to score a partition, is used by Kehler (1997) and Bean and Riloff (2004) to identify the most </context>

While many of the techniques discussed in this paper were originally developed for English, they have been applied to learn coreference models for other languages, such as Chinese (e.g., Converse (2006)), Japanese (e.g., Iida (2007)), Arabic (e.g., Luo and Zitouni (2005)), Dutch (e.g., Hoste (2005)), German (e.g., Wunsch (2010)), Swedish (e.g., Nilsson (2010)), and Czech (e.g., Ngu.y et al. (2009)). In addition, researchers have developed approaches that are targeted at handling certain kinds of anaphora present in non-English languages, such as zero anaphora (e.g., Iida et al. (2007a), Zhao and Ng (2007)). As Mitkov (2001) puts it, coreference resolution is a “difficult, but not intractable problem,” and we have been making “slow, but steady progress” on improving machine learning approaches to the problem in the past fifteen years. To ensure further progress, researchers should compare their results against a baseline that is stronger than the commonly-used Soon et al. (2001) system, which relies on a weak model (i.e., the mention-pair model) and a small set of linguistic features. As recent systems are becoming more sophisticated, we suggest that researchers make their systems publicly avai</context>

(2004b)). Compared to earlier work on anaphoricity determination, recently proposed approaches are more “global” in nature, taking into account the pairwise decisions made by the mention-pair model when making anaphoricity decisions. Examples of such approaches have exploited techniques including integer linear programming (ILP) (Denis and Baldridge, 2007a), label propagation (Zhou and Kong, 2009), and minimum cuts (Ng, 2009). 3.1.5 Combining Classification &amp; Clustering From a learning perspective, a two-step approach to coreference — classification and clustering — is undesirable. Since the classification model is trained independently of the clustering algorithm, improvements in classification accuracy do not guarantee corresponding improvements in clustering-level accuracy. That is, overall performance on the coreference task might not improve. To address this problem, McCallum and Wellner (2004) and Finley and Joachims (2005) eliminate the classification step entirely, treating cor</context>
