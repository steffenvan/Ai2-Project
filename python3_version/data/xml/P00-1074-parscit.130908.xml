Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999886153846154">
This is a paper that describes computational
linguistic activities on Philippines
languages. The Philippines is an archipelago
with vast numbers of islands and numerous
languages. The tasks of understanding,
representing and implementing these
languages require enormous work. An
extensive amount of work has been done on
understanding at least some of the major
Philippine languages, but little has been
done on the computational aspect. Majority
of the latter has been on the purpose of
machine translation.

Within the 7,200 islands of the Philippine
archipelago, there are about one hundred and
one (101) languages that are spoken. This is
according to the nationwide 1995 census
conducted by the National Statistics Office of
the Philippine Government (NSO, 1997). The
languages that are spoken by at least one percent
of the total household population include
Tagalog, Cebuano, Ilocano, Hiligaynon, Bikol,
Waray, Pampanggo or Kapangpangan,
Boholano, Pangasinan or Panggalatok, Maranao,
Maguin-danao, and Tausug.
Aside from these major languages, there are
other Philippine dialects, which are variants of
these major languages. Fortunato (1993)
classified these dialects into the top nine major
languages as above (except for Boholano which
is similar to Cebuano).

languages spoken in Southern Philippines. But
as of yet, extensive research has already been
done on theoretical linguistics and little is
known for computational linguistics. In fact, the
computational linguistics researches on
Philippine languages are mainly focused on
Tagalog.1 There are also notable work done on
Ilocano.
Kroeger (1993) showed the importance of the
grammatical relations in Tagalog, such as
subject and object relations, and the
insufficiency of a surface phrase structure
paradigm to represent these relations. This issue
was further discussed in the LFG98, which is on
the problem of voice and grammatical functions
in Western Austronesian Languages. Musgrave
(1998) introduced the problem certain verbs in
these languages that can head more than one
transitive clause type. Foley (1998) and Kroeger
(1998), in particular, discussed about long
debated issues such as nouns in Tagalog that can
be verbed, the voice system of Tagalog, and
Tagalog as a symmetrical voice system.
Latrouite (2000) argued that a level of semantic
representation is still necessary to explicitly
capture a word’s meaning.
Crawford (1999) contributed to an issue on
interrogative sentences and suggested that the
restriction on wh-movement reveals the
syntactic structure of Tagalog.
Potet (1995) and Trost (2000) provided general
materials on computational morphology, though,
both presented examples on Tagalog.
Rubino (1997, 1996) provided an in-depth
analysis of Ilocano. Among the major
contributions of the work include an extensive
treatment of the complex morphology in the
language, a thorough treatment of the discourse

One such software is the Universal Translator

IsaWika! is an English to Filipino machine
translator that uses the augmented transition
network as its computational architecture
(Roxas, 1999). It translates simple and
compound declarative statements as well as
imperative English statements. To date, it is the
most serious research undertaking in machine
translation in the Philippines.
Borra (1999) presented another translation
software that translates simple declarative and
imperative statements from English to Filipino.
The computational architecture of the system is
based on LFG, which differs from IsaWika’s
ATN implementation. Part of the research was
describing a possible set of semantic information
on every grammar category to establish a
semantically-close translation.

In fact, the computational linguistics researches on Philippine languages are mainly focused on Tagalog.1 There are also notable work done on Ilocano. Kroeger (1993) showed the importance of the grammatical relations in Tagalog, such as subject and object relations, and the insufficiency of a surface phrase structure paradigm to represent these relations. This issue was further discussed in the LFG98, which is on the problem of voice and grammatical functions in Western Austronesian Languages. Musgrave (1998) introduced the problem certain verbs in these languages that can head more than one transitive clause type. Foley (1998) and Kroeger (1998), in particular, discussed about long debated issues such as nouns in Tagalog that can be verbed, the voice system of Tagalog, and Tagalog as a symmetrical voice system. Latrouite (2000) argued that a level of semantic representation is still necessary to explicitly capture a word’s meaning. Crawford (1999) contributed to an issue on interrogative sentences and suggested that the restriction on wh-movement reveals the syntactic structure of Tagalog. Potet </context>
