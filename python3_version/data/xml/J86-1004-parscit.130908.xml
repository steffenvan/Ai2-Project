Hausser&apos;s Surface Compositional Grammar (henceforth
SCG) is intended to be one component of a global model
of human communication, which is called here a
&amp;quot;Speaker Simulation Device&amp;quot;. The structure of the gram-
mar itself, which is the subject of this first volume, will be
frequently justified according to its necessary interre-
lations with a pragmatic component (subject of a future
second volume). Hausser places his model in the frame-
work of a generative grammar which, unlike the one
elaborated by Chomskyan linguistics since Aspects, is
supposed to deal as well with a semantic level of repre-
sentation. The goal of this grammar is to give a complete
formal device, relating the surface sentences and their
literal meaning or meanings (called meaning!), expressed
as logical formulae. The grammar will be complete when
sophisticated enough to deal with the effects of the
context of communication; i.e., when it will be able to
establish a connection with the non-literal meaning(s) of
sentences (meaning2).
This formal model clearly derives from Montague
Grammar as described in &amp;quot;The Proper Treatment of
Quantification in Ordinary English&amp;quot; (traditionally
referred to as PTQ). First of all, the relation between the
surface form of expressions and the logical represen-
tation of their meanings has to be bidirectional. This
means that the system described by Hausser performs a
double mapping: from surface to meaning1 and,
conversely, from meaningl to surface. The rules of
syntax give a system similar to a generative grammar, but
rejecting the postulate of the autonomy of syntax. The
Fregean principle of surface compositionality of meaning,
as in PTQ, is taken as a basis for the construction of a
categorial syntax that focuses on a description of the
surface in terms of functor/argument relations. This
description is the (syntactic) projection of the formaliza-
tion based on predicate/argument relations at the seman-
tic level of representation. Such a syntax avoids the use
of (i) phrase-structure rewriting rules and (ii) transf-
ormations. In fact, the names of the syntactic categories
denote their combinatorial properties. Consequently,
one can note that Hausser&apos;s grammatical model is entire-
ly constructed around the lexical descriptions which
embody all the information about combinatorial and
semantic properties of lexical units.
To ensure a &amp;quot;strict&amp;quot; surface compositionality, Hausser
adopts the following requirements:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.68517">
• the syntactic component deals only with surface words
and is developed around a unique rule of categorial
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9599915">
composition, controlled by the combinatorial properties
of syntactic categories;
• likewise, the associated logical translationl is only
generated from the semantic representation of each
word, and finds its dynamic in the unique principle of
functional application.
Hausser&apos;s intensional logic is a little different from
Montague&apos;s in its definitions. First of all, it is strictly
intensional, which means that it avoids the use of the
operator of intensionality (this operator applies, by
default, to every logical expression). Another major
difference is that Hausser employs a new lambda-opera-
tor which runs less restrictive lambda-reductions than in
PTQ. I shall not go into the details of this formalism.
Suffice it to say that this new lambda-operator is inter-
nally justified by the context-free treatment of discontin-
uous elements.
The main novelty of SCG is its &amp;quot;orthogonal syntax&amp;quot;,
called ORTAX. It is based on a peculiar formalism,
developing graphically the relation between the surface
string to be analyzed and its translation in intensional
logic. Its interest is (i) to be very synthetic, (ii) to visual-
ize the functional analysis of the words in the surface
string, and (iii) to establish a correspondence between
the order of terms in an utterance and the one, frequently
different, of their translation within a whole logical
formula. The syntactic categories of ORTAX contain all
the information needed to construct these orthogonal
representations. For instance, using a notation which
may recall certain aspects of Lexical-Functional Gram-
mars (see Kaplan and Bresnan 1982), ORTAX interprets
the syntactic category AfB as: if x is of category AfB, it
can be combined with a y of category B, which is above
in the orthogonal projection (cf. ), to give an element of
category A. Conversely, AB will find its argument
below in the figure (or, which is equivalent, on the right
side in the linear order of surface sentences). A major
difference between Hausser&apos;s grammar and PTQ is that
every item of the surface has an associated translation in
intensional logic. Consequently, since the translation
process is entirely based on the surface words, the central
elements of SCG are the lexical units which are called
molecules. Each molecule is made of three distinct parts:
its surface form, category (which implies its syntactic
combinatory properties), and the translation in inten-
sional logic. It has to be noticed that even punctuation
marks have corresponding molecules to ensure the strict
surface compositionality of the system.
Following Montague&apos;s strategy, Hausser demonstrates
his system on a fragment of English. It is a convenient
way of showing how SCG copes with the most classical
linguistic phenomena. I shall mention here only:
• the different kinds of sentences (declarative, interroga-
tive, and &amp;quot;responsive&amp;quot;),

• subcategorization of lexical units according to their
proper complementation,
• quantifier scopes,
• de re/de dicto readings,
• treatment of temporality.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998754272727273">
ORTAX deals with all the main syntactic categories and
treats them in a non-syncategorematic manner, which
treatment is not entirely assumed by PTQ. Consequently,
Hausser notes himself that any extension of his grammat-
ical model must be done via transformations in the lexi-
con (the set of all molecules).
I have tried here to give a rapid overview of SCG and
it would be necessary to go into the details of Hausser&apos;s
presentation to estimate its consistency. It cannot be
done here, but., as a conclusion, I shall give my own eval-
uation according to the two following criteria:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999350333333333">
• the adequacy of the model for Hausser&apos;s own objec-
tives,
• its relevance for computational linguistics.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999250904761905">
To take the first point, I have not been convinced that
Hausser&apos;s model is a strictly surface compositional gram-
mar. In my opinion, dummy elements, which are here
molecules without any surface realization, are by defi-
nition incompatible with a strict surface compositionality.
These elements are present in Generative Transforma-
tional Grammar and even in PTQ (introduced, notably,
by the non-context-free rules). Of course, the use of
such artifacts seems to be justified in the context of
formal linguistics, but they are in contradiction with the
adoption of a principle of strict surface compositionality
of meaning if they have an associated semantic represen-
tation. And computational linguistics? One could evade
the question by saying that, if formal model like PTQ
have any computational interest, so has SCG. What is
interesting is that Hausser tries to treat some important
aspects of language frequently ignored. SCG gives some
solution to the following problems which are particularly
relevant to computational linguistics (automatic trans-
lation, automatic text processing, man-machine dialog,
etc.):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.996331222222222">
• What should be the description of peculiar structures
such as ellipsis?2
• How to use the information given by punctuation
marks (or intonation)?
• How to deal with morphology within a formal semantic
framework?
• How to build a general coherent system which would
be modular enough to allow easy improvements and
adaptations?
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.997081888888889">
This last point is particularly important and, in fact,
Hausser&apos;s book could be seen as the explanation of a
general algorithm for treating natural language. Such an
algorithm can give interesting insights and, like PTQ,
inspire some researchers in the field of computational
linguistics.
To conclude this presentation, it is important to note
that Hausser&apos;s style is clear and very &amp;quot;pedagogical&amp;quot;. He
tries to explain every detail of his model progressively
(even if, sometimes, the exposition of problems is a little
bit reductive). Obviously, this book is suited best for
logicians interested in studying a syntactic-semantic
model for natural language. The description of ORTAX
and of its connections with other syntactic models is
particularly clear and precise. The one of intensional
logic? It is absolutely hermetic for uninitiated readers.
They should, at least, try Dowty et al. (1981) or an
equivalent presentation.

The major emphasis in this book seems to be on the role
of linguistic theory and behavior in leading to an under-
standing of human cognition. The book is divided into
three sections which present different perspectives on the
problem within the disciplines of linguistics, psychology,
and artificial intelligence.
Rather than approaching an integration of perspec-
tives, the book leaves one with a feeling that they are still
very distant. Although the issues raised in the introduc-
tion are discussed by the authors of each paper, there is
no attempt to integrate the discussion. Instead, I felt that
each paper presented a &amp;quot;different side of the problem&amp;quot;
and that several of the authors were taking issue about
problems which were more specific to their discipline and
not immediate to the issues raised.
Overall, there are several relevant discussions of
language and mental process. However, while the
discussions border on integrated processing, the presen-
tations and information processing models described are
