1. Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999032828571429">
Text adaptation is a teacher practice used to help
with reading comprehension and English
language skills development for English language
learners (ELLs) (Carlo, August, McLaughlin,
Snow, Dressler, Lippman, Lively, &amp; White,
2004; Echevarria, Vogt and Short, 2004; Yano,
Long and Ross, 1994). The practice of text
adaptation involves a teacher’s modification of
texts to make them more understandable, given a
student’s reading level. Teacher adaptations
include text summaries, vocabulary support (e.g.,
providing synonyms), and translation. It is a time-
consuming, but critical practice for K-12 teachers
who teach ELLs, since reading-level appropriate
texts are often hard to find. To this end, we have
implemented the Automated Text Adaptation
Tool v.1.0 (ATA v.1.0): an innovative,
educational tool that automatically generates text
adaptations similar to those teachers might create.
We have also completed a teacher pilot study.
Schwarm and Ostendorf (2005), and Heilman,
Collins-Thompson, Callan, and Eskenazi (2006)
describe related research addressing the
development of NLP-based reading support tools.
During our interactive demonstration,
conference participants can (a) login to the
Internet-accessible tool, (b) import text files, and
(c) experiment with adaptation features. We are
currently interested in feedback from the
computational linguistics community to inform
tool development related to (a) feature
enhancement, and (b) ideas for new NLP-based
features. Until now, our primary source of
feedback has been from teachers toward tool
development from an educational perspective.

2. The Automated Text Adaptation Tool
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9508188">
NLP-based text adaptation capabilities in the tool
are described in this section (also see Figure 1.)
These adaptation features were selected for
implementation since they resemble teacher-
based adaptation methods.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.963235">
2.1 English and Spanish Marginal Notes
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999857333333333">
Pedagogically, marginal notes are a kind of text
summary. The Rhext automatic summarization
tool (Marcu, 2000) is used to produce marginal
notes in English. The amount of marginal notes
generated can be increased or decreased based on
students’ needs. Using Language Weaver’s1
English-to-Spanish machine translation system,
English marginal notes can be translated into
Spanish.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.996461">
2.2 Vocabulary Support
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999875333333333">
Synonyms for lower frequency (more difficult)
words are output using a statistically-generated
word similarity matrix (Lin, 1998). ATA v.1.0
generates antonyms for vocabulary in the text
using WordNet®.2 Cognates are words which
have the same spelling and meaning in two
languages (e.g., animal in English and Spanish).
The tool generates these using an ETS
English/Spanish cognate lexicon.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.995686">
2.3 English and Spanish Text-to-Speech
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999518">
The tool offers English and Spanish text-to-
speech (TTS)3. English TTS may be useful for
pronunciation support, while Spanish TTS
provides access to the Spanish texts for Spanish-
speaking ELLs who are not literate in Spanish.

3. Pilot Study with Teachers
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999990818181818">
The survey feedback indicated that the 12 teachers
were positive about the tool’s potential. Overall,
the vocabulary and English marginal notes were
the most favorite features, while the text-to-speech
was the least favorite. Teachers commented that
they would like to see an editing capability added
that would allow them to make changes to the
automatically generated outputs (i.e., vocabulary
support, and English and Spanish marginal notes.)
Teachers viewed the tool either as lesson planning
support, or as a student tool for independent work.

4. Future Research
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997792">
ATA v.1.0 is a young application that uses NLP
methods to create text adaptations. The teacher pilot
evaluation suggested that it produces adaptations
with potentially effective support for ELLs. It could
also save teachers lesson planning time. We are
currently implementing teacher-suggested
modifications, and planning a larger, school-based
pilot. The pilot will evaluate the tool’s effectiveness
in terms of measurable learning gains in reading
comprehension and English language skills.
