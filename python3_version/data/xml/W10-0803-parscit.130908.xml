Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.9952001">
In this paper we investigate the Presentational
Relative Clause (PRC) construction. In both the
linguistic and NLP literature, relative clauses
have been considered to contain background
information that is not directly relevant or highly
useful in semantic analysis. In text
summarization in particular, the information
contained in the relative clauses is often
removed, being viewed as non-central content to
the topic or discourse. We discuss the
importance of distinguishing the PRC
construction from other relative clause types.
We show that in the PRC, the relative clause,
rather than the main clause, contains the
assertion of the utterance. Based on linguistic
analysis, we suggest informative features that
may be used in automatic extraction of PRC
constructions. We believe that identifying this
construction will be useful in discriminating
central information from peripheral.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999880638888889">
Identifying and extracting relevant information in a
given text is an important task for human readers
and natural language processing applications. To
do this, proper identification and treatment of
complex sentences containing relative clauses and
other embedded structures such as appositive
clauses (e.g., My mother, a patient at the center,
met him last year,) and participial clauses (e.g.,
Once he ate Werthers, including the wrapper,) is
necessary.
Thus, the tasks of text simplification and text
summarization in NLP have focused their efforts
on finding effective ways of simplifying long and
complex sentences into shorter and simpler ones.
This has in turn proven useful in machine
translation (Chandrasekar et. al., 1996), parsing
and information extraction (Chandrasekar and
Srinivas, 1997), as well as document simplification
designed to make texts accessible to wider
audiences. Such audiences include readers at low
literacy levels (Siddharthan, 2003), second
language learners (Petersen and Ostendorf, 2007)
and aphasic readers (Devilin and Unthank, 2006).
The goal of text simplification and
summarization is to reduce syntactic or structural
complexities while preserving the central meaning
or relevant information in the given text.
Unfortunately, syntactic simplification algorithms
often assume a uniform treatment of syntactic
structures. This is especially true in the domain of
relative clauses.
Relative clauses are often considered to contain
parenthetical information. That is, their putative
role in the sentence is to provide background
information about the mentioned entity or entities.

According to the above definition of relative
clauses, they key information in (1) is in the main
clause You get a guy down the street. That is, (1)
means something like: the entity you comes to
possess a guy down the street. If we accordingly
consider the relative clause as the background or
incidental information and remove it from the
semantic analysis, the assertion – the key piece of
the information – would be lost.
In this paper, we discuss the Presentational
Relative Clause (PRC) construction, as seen in (1).
In the PRC, the relative clause, rather than the
main clause, contains the assertion of the utterance
(Duffield &amp; Michaelis, 2009). Moreover, we
analyze the construction in detail to assess its
potential usefulness in NLP applications. Based on
linguistic analysis, we suggest features that may be
useful for implementation of automatic
identification of PRC constructions. We believe
that the identification of this construction will be
useful in discriminating central information units
from the peripheral ones.

2 Relative Clauses
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997495333333333">
Relative clauses are constructions in which a
verbal clause modifies a nominal element, the
“head,” as shown in (2) and (3):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.93431825">
(2) I [like] cars that _____ are designed with human
beings in mind.
(3) I [like] those movies that you watch ____ time
and time again.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999945368421053">
In (2), the relative clause that are designed with
human beings in mind describes the head nominal
cars, while in (3), the head nominal those movies is
described by the relative clause that you watch
time and time again. The gap in the relative clause
indicating the position of the co-referential noun
phrase is shown.
Relative clauses are typically embedded in main
clauses, with the result that the nominal element
satisfies a semantic-role requirement of two
different verbs. For example, consider sentence
(2), where the head nominal cars serves as an
argument of the verb like while a gap that shares its
referent with the head nominal marks the argument
of the passive verb designed. Likewise, in (3) the
referent shared by the head nominal those movies
in the main clause and the gap in the relative clause
satisfies the requirements of two separate verbs,
like and watch.

2.1 Types of Relative Clauses
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997385333333333">
In the linguistic tradition, relative clauses are
typically classified into restrictive and non-
restrictive types, as seen in (4-5), respectively.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.981596333333333">
(4) And, you know, I [want] a car that I can work on
____, because I think it just costs too much even
to get the oil changed anymore.
(5) And once you’ve [reached] the river walk area,
which ____ is the tourist area, it’s usually pretty
safe during the day.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999938523809524">
In (4), the speaker has asserted that he would like a
car; the restrictive relative clause specifies the type
of car as one belonging to the set of cars that he
could work on, as opposed to a type of car that he
would be unable to repair. In (5), the relative
clause does not identify the river walk area as one
out of a set of areas, but simply provides additional
information about it. In neither case does the
relative clause assert information in the discourse;
rather, it expresses a presupposed proposition (e.g.,
‘I can work on x,’‘x is the tourist area’) that is
assumed to be known by both the speaker and the
addressee.
Accordingly, relative clauses are assumed to
provide background information concerning the
entities they modify. This background material
serves either to distinguish the referent from others
of its kind, as in a restrictive relative clause, or
provide additional material, as in a non-restrictive
relative clause, rather than asserting something
new about the referent.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99837">
2.2 Relative Clauses in NLP
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999833222222222">
In line with the linguistic consensus, work in NLP
has also viewed relative clauses as expressing
background information about a referent. In
syntactic simplification, the structural complexity
is resolved by splitting a sentence into multiple
ones (Siddharthan, 2003; Chandrasekar, 1996). In
effect, the relative clause is pulled out of the main
clause into an independent sentence. For example,
(5) would be simplified into (6).

(6) And once you’ve reached the river walk area, it’s

walk area is the tourist area.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998145">
In text summarization, where background
information is considered parenthetical and
identified with non-key content, relative clauses
are simply disregarded (Siddharthan et al., 2004).
That is, if we consider the relative clause to contain
parenthetical information, it is reasonable to
simply remove the non-key content from the text
prior to any semantic analysis.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.943321" genericHeader="method">
3 Presentational Relative Clauses
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99984612">
As the analysis of (1) above suggests, however, not
all relative clauses contain parenthetical
information. In fact, many linguistic studies have
argued that subordinate clauses can make
assertions (Goldberg, 2006; Menn, 1974;
McCawley, 1981; Fox &amp; Thompson, 1990), as a
counterpoint to the studies that view them as
expressing exclusively backgrounded information
(Shibatani, 2009).
Here, in line with Michaelis and Lambrecht
(1996), Kay and Fillmore (1999) and other work in
the Construction Grammar tradition, we analyze a
particular construction, the Presentational Relative
Clause construction (PRC), as a productive
idiomatic pattern. The PRC is a construction in
which the material presented in the relative clause
is not backgrounded, either in the sense of being
unnecessary parenthetical material, or in the sense
of being already known to both speaker and
addressee (Duffield &amp; Michaelis, 2009). In the
PRC, information is asserted in the relative clause
that modifies the nominal element, which is
introduced by a semantically bleached main clause.
Examples of the PRC include (1) and the
following:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.994974714285714">
(7) They [had] some guy that ___ was defending
himself.
(8) And I [know] people who ___have been drug
tested and who have not, you know, been hired
by a corporation.
(9) And they&apos;ve [got] a fifteen year old that ___&apos;s
their boss that ___ is carrying a gun
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999788">
Each of the examples above were examined in
their original contexts to determining that an
uninformative main clause introduces the head
nominal, while an assertion is contained within the
relative clause. In (7), the main clause that
introduces the referent some guy is semantically
uninformative. By this we mean that it does NOT
assert that the entity they possessed some guy.
Rather, the asserted proposition in the utterance is
in the relative clause, and (7) can be paraphrased as
A guy was defending himself. In (8) the important
information is not that the speaker knows a certain
set of people. Instead, the key assertion here is:
“Some people have been drug tested and have not
been hired by a corporation.” Likewise, (9),
illustrating what might be described as a double-
PRC, could be rephrased as, “A fifteen-year-old is
their boss and is carrying a gun.”
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999575">
3.1 Anatomy of the PRC construction
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999648764705882">
The PRC construction is typically characterized by
three main properties: a semantically empty main
clause, a head nominal in the object position of the
main clause that is newly introduced into the
discourse, and a subject-gap relative clause that
modifies the head nominal.
First property: The semantically bleached main
clause serves to convey the restriction on the range
of the existential quantifier rather than an assertion.
In (7), for example, the main clause conveys the
restriction ‘x is a guy’. Consequently, a PRC,
unlike a restrictive relative, is not optional. It is a
required part of the clause in which it appears,
exemplified by the fact that (7) cannot reasonably
be construed as asserting ‘They had some guy’.
Being uninformative, the main verbs of PRC
tend to have low semantic weight, as in (10-12).
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.965967625">
(10) I&apos;ve [seen] some statistics that ___ say it&apos;s more
expensive to kill somebody than to keep them
in prison for life.
(11) You [get] a guy down the street who ___ comes
up, uh, carrying a knife.
(12) When our kids were small we [had] a couple of,
uh, good women who ___ would often come to
the house.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999940833333333">
The bracketed main verbs in (10-12), which
otherwise denote relations of perception, obtaining,
and possession, respectively, here appear simply to
‘set the stage’ for their object referents. In other
words, (10) does not assert that the speaker sees
something, (11) does not assert that the addressee
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.995409">
19
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.992299631578947">
obtains something and (12) does not assert that
some people possessed someone. Rather than
predicating a property or action of the main clause
subject, the main clause predications in (10-12)
provide an explicit or inferred center of perspective
from which to view the entity denoted by the head
nominal (Koenig and Lambrecht, 1999).
Second property: The discourse-new head
nominal is in the object position of the main
clause. Thus, the PRC enables the speaker to
avoid violating a hearer-based information-
packaging constraint that Lambrecht (1994) refers
to as the Principle of Separation of Reference and
Role (PSRR): “Do not introduce a referent and talk
about it in the same clause” (ibid). In other words,
to aid the hearer in anchoring the new referent in
discourse, the speaker introduces it in the object
position of the main clause, and then predicates
upon it in the relative clause, as in example (13):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.982787">
(13) Speaker A: We have more options now then
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.862811529411765">
(sic) we did when my kids were
born, with being able to take off
full-time longer, you can phase your
schedule in so that it &apos;s not full-time
for up to six months.
Speaker B: Oh boy, that&apos;s great.
Speaker A: It &apos;s really neat. I&apos;ve [had] a couple
of assistants that ___ came back
just three days a week or they&apos;ve,
you know, whatever schedule they
want from a pay standpoint.
Consider Speaker A’s second turn, restructured as
a declarative clause rather than as a PRC, and thus
violating the PSRR. This time the assertion is
conveyed in the main clause, but with the new
entity in the in the subject position the result is
pragmatically awkward:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.5454784">
(14) Speaker A: It &apos;s really neat. A couple of
assistants came back just three days
a week or they&apos;ve, you know,
whatever schedule they want from a
pay standpoint.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.889693">
An additional example is provided in (15):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.951931333333333">
(15) Speaker B: I’ve never liked D.C. a whole lot
and a really hate the Redskins. And
a lot of it&apos;s because, you know, I
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.806694214285714">
[got] a lot of people, you know, at
work with and everything that __
are big Redskin fans. (??A lot of
people I work with and everything
are big Redskin fans.)
Thus, a crucial identifying characteristic of the
PRC is that it always modifies head nominals that
are main-clause objects.
Third property: Third identifying property of the
PRC is the presence of a subject-gap relative
clause. That is, the relative clause modifying the
head nominal contains a gap in the subject position
of the relative clause that is co-referential with the
head nominal, as in (7) repeated here as (16):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.957695">
(16) They [had] some guy that ___ was defending
himself.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999607333333333">
There are, however, cases in which the head
nominal is modified by an object-gap relative
clause, which conveys an assertion, as in (17):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.59358375">
(17) Everybody [gets] five pounds of garbage that
they can throw away____ you know uh but
more than that every week uh you’ve got to
pay by the pound.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999995">
In the example above, as with the more
prototypical subject-gap PRC, the main clause
does not make an assertion (in this case, the main
clause does not assert that everybody receives five
pounds of garbage). Rather, the assertion in the
relative clause is demonstrated by the appropriate
paraphrase, “Everybody can throw away five
pounds of garbage.” While speakers do produce
object-gap sentences to convey assertions, subject-
gap PRC tokens account for the majority of
assertoric relative clauses in spoken discourse
(Duffield and Michaelis, 2009). This results in the
subject-gap structure being a useful property for
identifying prototypical instances of the PRC.

<sectionHeader confidence="0.939466" genericHeader="method">
4 Why identify the PRC construction?
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999940833333333">
As argued above, identifying the PRC is important
because, unlike restrictive and non-restrictive
relative clauses, the PRC does not present
backgrounded or parenthetical information. Rather,
the loss of information asserted in a PRC results in
the loss of inferences crucial for the discourse.

4.1 “My son is an animal lover.”
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.970914176470588">
So far we have seen sentences or utterances that
would inarguably be interpreted as sentences
containing a PRC. However, there are PRCs,
which, while equipped with every relevant PRC
characteristic, initially appear to contain relative
clauses expressing parenthetical information.
Consider the following sentence:
(18) I [had] a son, he’s now gone from the home,
that ___ was an animal lover.
In isolation, (18) could be interpreted as asserting
that the speaker has a son, who now happens to
have left home. The relative clause that was an
animal lover would be treated as background
information about the son. Yet an examination of
the context of the conversation reveals that the
relative clause contains crucial information with
regard to the discourse as a whole:
</bodyText>
<table confidence="0.909900666666667">
(19) Speaker A: Do you want to hear about my
other animals I&apos;ve had?
Speaker B: Sure, sure.
Speaker A: I&apos;ve had a skunk
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker A: I&apos;ve had a Burmese python,
I&apos;ve had rats, I’ve had mice.
Speaker B: Wow.
Speaker A: Uh, let&apos;s see, I&apos;ve had gerbils, I
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.68705">
have, I [had] a son, he’s now
gone from the home, that ___
was an animal lover.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.5186915">
Speaker B: Uh-huh.
Speaker A: So at one point I had a snake,
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.989080533333333">
skunk, dog and a cat running loose
in the house.
In this case, we see even a more compelling reason
to identify this sentence as a PRC. Disregarding
the relative clause in (18) and treating the main
clause as containing an asserted proposition,
results in a radically different reading: the
speaker’s son is among the animals that the
speaker claims to have owned (i.e. “I’ve had a
skunk, I’ve had a Burmese python, I’ve had rats,
I’ve had mice, I’ve had gerbils, I had a sonÉ”). By
classifying this sentence as a PRC, we reach the
intended assertion, “My son was an animal lover,”
which in turn explains why the speaker has been
the proud owner of a menagerie of animals.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.984228">
4.2 Other examples
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999947782608696">
Much like the example in (18), the discourse
context of the other PRCs presented in this paper
substantiates the claim that they present
information central to the discourse. The PRC in
(7) “They [had] some guy that was defending
himself,” used in a conversation describing a trial,
signals that the situation departs from the
prototypical courtroom schema in a crucial respect
(the defendant is without a lawyer).
Other instances of the PRC, such as (8) “And I
[know] people who ___have been drug tested
and who have not, you know, been hired by a
corporation,” like (18), provide explanatory
information: the reason for the speaker’s negative
view of drug-testing. Finally, in (15) “I [got] a lot
of people, you know, at work with and everything
that ___ are big Redskin fans,” the PRC
utterance explains why the speaker dislikes a
particular football team. Treating these clauses as
background information, restricting categories of
entities, or removing them from semantic analysis
results in the loss of information about causal
connections in the text.

5 Identifying the PRC construction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999944785714286">
Thus far we have presented the identifying
linguistic properties of the PRC constructions. We
will now demonstrate how these properties (see
Section 3.1) lend themselves to features that could
be useful for automatic identification and
classification of PRCs. For the purposes of this
section we make the assumption that we will only
retain instances that can be parsed by an automatic
parser (Collins 1999, Charniak, 1997). The
features we suggest are based on the results of a
corpus study carried out by Duffield and Michaelis
(in prep) examining the role of the PRC in the
distribution of relative clause types in spoken
discourse.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.977395">
5.1 The distribution of the PRC in discourse

<bodyText confidence="0.999737">
In the study by Duffield and Michaelis (2009, in
prep), 1000 sentences (500 each of subject-gap and
object-gap relative clauses) from the Switchboard
Corpus (Godfrey, 1996) were manually examined
for the first two of the identifying properties of
PRC tokens as described in Section 3.1. In
addition, each of the 1000 sentences was examined
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.998064">
21
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999900222222222">
within a context of 50 lines of previous discourse
to determine whether or not the relative clause
conveyed an assertion.
Their results showed that three properties,
namely, a semantically bleached verb, discourse-
new head nominals, and an assertion in the relative
clause, were found to significantly predict relative
clauses of the subject-gap type, suggesting that
PRCs account for the prevalence of subject-gap
relative clauses in discourse. In fact, 22.4% of
subject-gap relative clauses were PRCs, while only
6.8% of object-gap relative clauses displayed
features of the PRC. The manner in which
Duffield and Michaelis manually annotated their
data, although based on linguistic analysis as
discussed above, easily lends itself to a list of
properties that could be automatically used to
identify PRCs in larger corpora.

5.2 Verb in the main clause
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.982885428571429">
Corresponding to the first property (Section 3.1) of
a semantically empty main clause, Duffield &amp;
Michaelis have observed that PRC tokens have the
tendency to co-occur with verbs of existence,
perception and discovery. Table 1 lists these verbs.

</bodyText>
<tableCaption confidence="0.996578">

This suggests that encoding the lemmatized verbs
as features may help in automatic classification of
PRCs.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999876">
5.3 Position of head nominal
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.958815457142857">
The head nominal of the relative clause was found
to occur in two positions relative to the main-
clause verb. It was either the second argument of
the main-clause verb (20) or the complement in the
prepositional phrase (21), which in turn was the
second argument of the main-clause verb.
(20) They [had] {some guy that ___ was defending
himself.}-NP
(21) I have a friend who was [telling] me {about her
brother who ___ gets high all the time.}-PP
Duffield and Michaelis also observed that there
was a correlation between the main-clause verb
and the position in which the head nominal was
found. That is, the verbs such as look, tell, and
wonder were regularly found when the head
nominal was the complement in the PP, while
other verbs in Table 1 more frequently occurred
with the head nominal in the direct argument
position of the main-clause verb.
Furthermore, Duffield and Michaelis found that
in cases where the head nominal was the
complement of the PP, the head of the PP was
found to be either of or about.
This suggests that in conjunction with the
features derived from the lemmatized verb, the
position of the head nominal in relation to the
main-clause verb could be encoded as a feature.
That is, for each of the sentences examined, a
feature can be coded for either a NP complement
or PP complement, given which type of
complement the relative clause sits in.
In addition to the position of the head nominal,
for those relative clauses that are found in the PP
complement a feature can also be coded for the
preposition heading the phrase.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.991917">
5.4 Head nominal: noun and modifiers
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99997412">
Corresponding to the second property (Section 3.1)
of PRCs, discourse-new status of modified head
nominals, is indefinite form. Although Duffield &amp;
Michaelis recognize that the distinction between
the ‘given’ and ‘new’ discourse statuses is not the
same thing as definite versus indefinite form,
discourse-active entities tend to be formally
marked as definite, while discourse-new entities
tend to be marked as indefinite (Prince 1992).
Head nominals considered as indefinite include
bare plural nouns (e.g., engineers), determinerless
nominals modified by adjectives or cardinal
numbers (e.g., about forty kindergarteners), bare
mass nouns (e.g., material), nominals with weak
quantifiers (e.g., some companies), indefinite
pronouns (e.g., somebody, anybody) and nominals
containing the indefinite article a (e.g., a fish).
Definite head nominals include those containing
the definite article the (e.g., the thing, the
resources), demonstrative determiners (e.g., this

(e.g., my bass), strong quantifiers (e.g., every story,

indefinite heads (e.g., one of those things, some of
my friends) are also considered as indefinite.
To turn the above into linguistic features that are
characteristic of definite and indefinite head
nominals, we suggest a number of possible features
for classification. Several of these relating to the
head noun phrase may contribute to the
identification of PRCs:

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.702557">
Head nominal features:

<bodyText confidence="0.980624941176471">
- the phrasal categories of the sisters to the
noun in the head noun phrase. These features
will encode the presence of any adjectival or
prepositional phrases within the head noun
phrase. The inclusion of these features will
account for the existence of any adjectival
modification on the head noun phrase and/or
partitive nominals.
- the existence of named entities in the head
noun phrase to ascertain the existence of any
proper nouns in the head nominal.
Head nominal features encoding:
- whether or not the nominal is a pronoun. This
will serve to introduce the indefinite and
demonstrative pronouns into the classification
of PRCs.
- singularity/plurarity of the head nominal.

5.5 Gap in the relative clause
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992739095238095">
The third and final property shared by PRCs
concerns the gap in the relative clause. The gap
occurs in subject position and is co-referential with
the head nominal. This can be identified in the
syntactic parses by the presence of a trace in the
syntactic position co-indexed3 with the relative
pronouns that, who, or which.
3 Note that coindexation is distinct from coreference. In
Treebank, coindexation involves the creation of a syntactic
link between the trace and the constituent that was moved out
of the position trace now occupies. Coreference is the
relationship between the gap and the referent. Most parsers,
however, do not supply co-indexation.
The syntactic position of the gap can be coded
as a feature. These would also include a feature for
cases where the gap is entirely missing from the
relative clause. This is to account for cases of
relative clauses containing a pronoun in the
position where the gap should be (e.g. The gap in
this example is filled with the pronoun it: “Here[’s]
a journal that I’m in the board of it.”).

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.990638">
5.6 Subject position of matrix clause
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9982194">
In addition to the above features, based on Duffield
&amp; Michaelis’ characterization of the PRC, there is
one other syntactic characteristic worth
investigating—the subject of the matrix clause.
Consider the following PRCs:
</bodyText>
<reference confidence="0.460104571428571">
(22) They [had] some guy that ___ was defending
himself.
(23) There[’s] a lot of people that fall into that
category
(24) It [was] a moving man ____ pulled right up to
her house, broke in and stole everything she
owned4.
</reference>
<bodyText confidence="0.9986195">
General observation of PRCs is that they seem to
display a tendency to have either a pronoun (22),
or an expletive there (23) or it (24) in the subject
position of the matrix clause. This suggests that the
lexical content of the subject position may be a
useful predictor for PRC classification.

6 Discussion and Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999961928571429">
In this paper, we have presented identifying
properties of the PRC construction. We recognize
that individual properties as presented here
contribute to but do not determine the final
meaning of the PRC construction as a whole, but in
combination, they are likely predictors. Not all
syntactic forms can be treated in the same way. By
not privileging the syntactic level, but rather
treating lexical, morphological, and syntactic
features equally, we are able to identify key
indicators that could be used to identify the
function of a relative clause in discourse as
conveying an assertion as opposed to
backgrounded information.
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.739387333333333">
4 Certain types of PRCs, such as in this example, are produced
without the relative pronoun. Such PRCs are referred to as
amalgams (see Lambrecht, 1988 for discussion)

<bodyText confidence="0.999990954545455">
For the purposes of NLP, we must work within
the framework of phrasal structures, constrained by
the resources currently available. Yet as we have
suggested here, those resources, although not
constructionally based, can be used to identify
constructions for the purpose of extracting relevant
information from naturally occurring data. We
have further investigated the applicability of a
construction-based approach to identifying relative
clause types when the individual components, such
as lexical items themselves are not themselves
effective predictors. This clause-level information
allows for richer representations of textual
meaning.
Our future plans include experiments with
implementing automatic classifiers of relative
clause type based on these features. Such empirical
study will give us a better understanding of the
degree of usefulness of these features in
identifying PRCs in text data. We anticipate that
additional features will be discovered during the
implementation process.

<abstract confidence="0.998604523809524">In this paper we investigate the Presentational Relative Clause (PRC) construction. In both the linguistic and NLP literature, relative clauses have been considered to contain background information that is not directly relevant or highly useful in semantic analysis. In text summarization in particular, the information contained in the relative clauses is often removed, being viewed as non-central content to the topic or discourse. We discuss the importance of distinguishing the PRC construction from other relative clause types. We show that in the PRC, the relative clause, rather than the main clause, contains the assertion of the utterance. Based on linguistic analysis, we suggest informative features that may be used in automatic extraction of PRC constructions. We believe that identifying this construction will be useful in discriminating central information from peripheral.</abstract>

Thus, the tasks of text simplification and text summarization in NLP have focused their efforts on finding effective ways of simplifying long and complex sentences into shorter and simpler ones. This has in turn proven useful in machine translation (Chandrasekar et. al., 1996), parsing and information extraction (Chandrasekar and Srinivas, 1997), as well as document simplification designed to make texts accessible to wider audiences. Such audiences include readers at low literacy levels (Siddharthan, 2003), second language learners (Petersen and Ostendorf, 2007) and aphasic readers (Devilin and Unthank, 2006).

In the example above, as with the more prototypical subject-gap PRC, the main clause does not make an assertion (in this case, the main clause does not assert that everybody receives five pounds of garbage). Rather, the assertion in the relative clause is demonstrated by the appropriate paraphrase, “Everybody can throw away five pounds of garbage.” While speakers do produce object-gap sentences to convey assertions, subjectgap PRC tokens account for the majority of assertoric relative clauses in spoken discourse (Duffield and Michaelis, 2009). This results in the subject-gap structure being a useful property for identifying prototypical instances of the PRC. 4 Why identify the PRC construction? As argued above, identifying the PRC is important because, unlike restrictive and non-restrictive relative clauses, the PRC does not present backgrounded or parenthetical information. Rather, the loss of information asserted in a PRC results in the loss of inferences crucial for the discourse. 20 4.1 “My son is an animal lover.” So far we have seen sentences or utterances that would inarguably be interpreted as sentences containing a PRC.

In other words, (10) does not assert that the speaker sees something, (11) does not assert that the addressee 19 obtains something and (12) does not assert that some people possessed someone. Rather than predicating a property or action of the main clause subject, the main clause predications in (10-12) provide an explicit or inferred center of perspective from which to view the entity denoted by the head nominal (Koenig and Lambrecht, 1999).

Thus, the PRC enables the speaker to avoid violating a hearer-based informationpackaging constraint that Lambrecht (1994) refers to as the Principle of Separation of Reference and Role (PSRR): “Do not introduce a referent and talk about it in the same clause” (ibid).

This background material serves either to distinguish the referent from others of its kind, as in a restrictive relative clause, or provide additional material, as in a non-restrictive relative clause, rather than asserting something new about the referent. 2.2 Relative Clauses in NLP In line with the linguistic consensus, work in NLP has also viewed relative clauses as expressing background information about a referent. In syntactic simplification, the structural complexity is resolved by splitting a sentence into multiple ones (Siddharthan, 2003; Chandrasekar, 1996). In effect, the relative clause is pulled out of the main clause into an independent sentence. For example, (5) would be simplified into (6). 18 (6) And once you’ve reached the river walk area, it’s usually pretty safe during the day. The river walk area is the tourist area.
