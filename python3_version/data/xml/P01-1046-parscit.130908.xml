Previous research has shown that the
plausibility of an adjective-noun com-
bination is correlated with its corpus
co-occurrence frequency. In this paper,
we estimate the co-occurrence frequen-
cies of adjective-noun pairs that fail to
occur in a 100 million word corpus
using smoothing techniques and com-
pare them to human plausibility rat-
ings. Both class-based smoothing and
distance-weighted averaging yield fre-
quency estimates that are significant
predictors of rated plausibility, which
provides independent evidence for the
validity of these smoothing techniques.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999960529411765">
Certain combinations of adjectives and nouns are
perceived as more plausible than others. A classi-
cal example is strong tea, which is highly plausi-
ble, as opposed to powerful tea, which is not. On
the other hand, powerful car is highly plausible,
whereas strong car is less plausible. It has been
argued in the theoretical literature that the plausi-
bility of an adjective-noun pair is largely a collo-
cational (i.e., idiosyncratic) property, in contrast
to verb-object or noun-noun plausibility, which is
more predictable (Cruse, 1986; Smadja, 1991).
The collocational hypothesis has recently
been investigated in a corpus study by
Lapata et al. (1999). This study investigated
potential statistical predictors of adjective-noun
plausibility by using correlation analysis to com-
pare judgements elicited from human subjects
with five corpus-derived measures: co-occurrence
frequency of the adjective-noun pair, noun
frequency, conditional probability of the noun
given the adjective, the log-likelihood ratio, and
Resnik’s (1993) selectional association measure.
All predictors but one were positively correlated
with plausibility; the highest correlation was
obtained with co-occurrence frequency. Resnik’s
selectional association measure surprisingly
yielded a significant negative correlation with
judged plausibility. These results suggest that
the best predictor of whether an adjective-noun
combination is plausible or not is simply how
often the adjective and the noun collocate in a
record of language experience.
As a predictor of plausibility, co-occurrence
frequency has the obvious limitation that it can-
not be applied to adjective-noun pairs that never
occur in the corpus. A zero co-occurrence count
might be due to insufficient evidence or might
reflect the fact that the adjective-noun pair is in-
herently implausible. In the present paper, we ad-
dress this problem by using smoothing techniques
(distance-weighted averaging and class-based
smoothing) to recreate missing co-occurrence
counts, which we then compare to plausibility
judgements elicited from human subjects. By
demonstrating a correlation between recreated
frequencies and plausibility judgements, we show
that these smoothing methods produce realistic
frequency estimates for missing co-occurrence
data. This approach allows us to establish the va-
lidity of smoothing methods independent from a
specific natural language processing task.

2 Smoothing Methods
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999813541666667">
Smoothing techniques have been used in a variety
of statistical natural language processing applica-
tions as a means to address data sparseness, an in-
herent problem for statistical methods which rely
on the relative frequencies of word combinations.
The problem arises when the probability of word
combinations that do not occur in the training
data needs to be estimated. The smoothing meth-
ods proposed in the literature (overviews are pro-
vided by Dagan et al. (1999) and Lee (1999)) can
be generally divided into three types: discount-
ing (Katz, 1987), class-based smoothing (Resnik,
1993; Brown et al., 1992; Pereira et al., 1993),
and distance-weighted averaging (Grishman and
Sterling, 1994; Dagan et al., 1999).
Discounting methods decrease the probability
of previously seen events so that the total prob-
ability of observed word co-occurrences is less
than one, leaving some probability mass to be re-
distributed among unseen co-occurrences.
Class-based smoothing and distance-weighted
averaging both rely on an intuitively simple idea:
inter-word dependencies are modelled by relying
on the corpus evidence available for words that
are similar to the words of interest. The two ap-
proaches differ in the way they measure word
similarity. Distance-weighted averaging estimates
word similarity from lexical co-occurrence infor-
mation, viz., it finds similar words by taking into
account the linguistic contexts in which they oc-
cur: two words are similar if they occur in sim-
ilar contexts. In class-based smoothing, classes
are used as the basis according to which the co-
occurrence probability of unseen word combina-
tions is estimated. Classes can be induced directly
from the corpus (Pereira et al., 1993; Brown et al.,
1992) or taken from a manually crafted taxonomy
(Resnik, 1993). In the latter case the taxonomy is
used to provide a mapping from words to concep-
tual classes.
In language modelling, smoothing techniques
are typically evaluated by showing that a lan-
guage model which uses smoothed estimates in-
curs a reduction in perplexity on test data over a
model that does not employ smoothed estimates
(Katz, 1987). Dagan et al. (1999) use perplexity
to compare back-off smoothing against distance-
weighted averaging methods and show that the
latter outperform the former. They also com-
pare different distance-weighted averaging meth-
ods on a pseudo-word disambiguation task where
the language model decides which of two verbs
v1 and v2 is more likely to take a noun n as its
object. The method being tested must reconstruct
which of the unseen (v1,n) and (v2,n) is a valid
verb-object combination.
In our experiments we recreated co-occurrence
frequencies for unseen adjective-noun pairs using
two different approaches: taxonomic class-based
smoothing and distance-weighted averaging.1 We
evaluated the recreated frequencies by comparing
them with plausibility judgements elicited from
human subjects. In contrast to previous work, this
type of evaluation does not presuppose that the
recreated frequencies are needed for a specific
natural language processing task. Rather, our aim
is to establish an independent criterion for the
validity of smoothing techniques by comparing
them to plausibility judgements, which are known
to correlate with co-occurrence frequency (Lapata
et al., 1999).
In the remainder of this paper we present class-

<bodyText confidence="0.99920408">
We recreated co-occurrence frequencies for un-
seen adjective-noun pairs using a simplified ver-
sion of Resnik’s (1993) selectional association
measure. Selectional association is defined as the
amount of information a given predicate carries
about its argument, where the argument is rep-
resented by its corresponding classes in a taxon-
omy such as WordNet (Miller et al., 1990). This
means that predicates which impose few restric-
tions on their arguments have low selectional as-
sociation values, whereas predicates selecting for
a restricted number of arguments have high se-
lectional association values. Consider the verbs
see and polymerise: intuitively there is a great
variety of things which can be seen, whereas
there is a very specific set of things which can
be polymerised (e.g., ethylene). Resnik demon-
strated that his measure of selectional associa-
tion successfully captures this intuition: selec-
tional association values are correlated with verb-
argument plausibility as judged by native speak-
ers.
However, Lapata et al. (1999) found that the
success of selectional association as a predictor
of plausibility does not seem to carry over to
adjective-noun plausibility. There are two poten-
tial reasons for this: (1) the semantic restrictions
that adjectives impose on the nouns with which
they combine appear to be less strict than the
ones imposed by verbs (consider the adjective su-
perb which can combine with nearly any noun);
and (2) given their lexicalist nature, adjective-
noun combinations may defy selectional restric-
tions yet be intuitively plausible (consider the pair
sad day, where sadness is not an attribute of day).
To address these problems, we replaced
Resnik’s information-theoretic measure with a
simpler measure which makes no assumptions
with respect to the contribution of a semantic
class to the total quantity of information provided
by the predicate about the semantic classes of
its argument. We simply substitute the noun oc-
curring in the adjective-noun combination with
the concept by which it is represented in the
taxonomy and estimate the adjective-noun co-
occurrence frequency by counting the number of
times the concept corresponding to the noun is ob-
served to co-occur with the adjective in the cor-
pus. Because a given word is not always repre-
sented by a single class in the taxonomy (i.e., the

an adjective-noun pair for each conceptual class

1995; Resnik, 1993):

jective a was observed in the corpus with con-
cept c  classes(n) and |classes(n) |is the num-
ber of conceptual classes noun n belongs to. Note
that the estimation of the frequency f(a,c) relies
on the simplifying assumption that the noun co-
occurring with the adjective is distributed evenly
across its conceptual classes. This simplification
is necessary unless we have a corpus of adjective-
noun pairs labelled explicitly with taxonomic in-
formation.2
Consider the pair proud chief which is
not attested in the British National Corpus
(BNC) (Burnard, 1995). The word chief has
two senses in WordNet and belongs to seven
conceptual classes (causal agent, entity,
leader, life form, person, superior,
and supervisor) This means that the co-
occurrence frequency of the adjective-noun pair
will be constructed for each of the seven classes,
as shown in Table 1. Suppose for example that
we see the pair proud leader in the corpus. The
word leader has two senses in WordNet and
belongs to eight conceptual classes (person,
life from, entity, causal agent,
feature, merchandise, commodity, and
object). The words chief and leader have four
conceptual classes in common, i.e., person and
life form, entity, and causal agent.
This means that we will increment the observed
co-occurrence count of proud and person,
proud and life form, proud and entity,
and proud and causal agent by 18. Since we

the corpus, we weight the contribution of each
class by taking the average of the constructed
frequencies for all seven classes:
|classes(n)|
Based on (2) the recreated frequency for the pair
proud chief in the BNC is 6.12 (see Table 1).

2.2 Distance-Weighted Averaging
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999985352941176">
Distance-weighted averaging induces classes of
similar words from word co-occurrences with-
out making reference to a taxonomy. A key fea-
ture of this type of smoothing is the function
which measures distributional similarity from co-
occurrence frequencies. Several measures of dis-
tributional similarity have been proposed in the
literature (Dagan et al., 1999; Lee, 1999). We
used two measures, the Jensen-Shannon diver-
gence and the confusion probability. Those two
measures have been previously shown to give
promising performance for the task of estimat-
ing the frequencies of unseen verb-argument pairs
(Dagan et al., 1999; Grishman and Sterling, 1994;
Lapata, 2000; Lee, 1999). In the following we
describe these two similarity measures and show
how they can be used to recreate the frequencies
for unseen adjective-noun pairs.
Jensen-Shannon Divergence. The Jensen-
Shannon divergence is an information-theoretic
measure that recasts the concept of distributional
similarity into a measure of the “distance”
(i.e., dissimilarity) between two probability
distributions.
Let w1 and w1 be an unseen sequence of
two words whose distributional similarity is to
be determined. Let P(w2|w1) denote the condi-
tional probability of word w2 given word w1 and
P(w2|w1) denote the conditional probability of
w2 given w1. For notational simplicity we write
p(w2) for P(w2|w1) and q(w2) for P(w2|w1). The
Jensen-Shannon divergence is defined as the av-
erage Kullback-Leibler divergence of each of two
distributions to their average distribution:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.815281">
(3) J(p,q) = ~D~p+

where (p+ q)/2 denotes the average distribution:

(4) 2
1 �P(w2|w1)+P(w2|w 1)~
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997845">
The Kullback-Leibler divergence is an
information-theoretic measure of the dissim-
ilarity of two probability distributions p and q,
defined as follows:

(2) f (a,n) =
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999892125">
In our case the distributions p and q are the
conditional probability distributions P(w2|w1)
and P(w2|w1), respectively. Computation of the
Jensen-Shannon divergence depends only on the
linguistic contexts w2 which the two words w1
and w1 have in common. The Jensen-Shannon di-
vergence, a dissimilarity measure, is transformed
to a similarity measure as follows:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.904199">
(6) WJ(p,q) = 10−βJ(p,q)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.992767111111111">
The parameter β controls the relative influence of
the words most similar to w1: if β is high, only
words extremely similar to w1 contribute to the
estimate, whereas if β is low, less similar words
also contribute to the estimate.
Confusion Probability. The confusion proba-
bility is an estimate of the probability that word
w1 can be substituted by word w1, in the sense of
being found in the same linguistic contexts.
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9975175">
(7) Pc(w1|w1) =∑ P(w1|w2)P(w2|w1)

<bodyText confidence="0.9991785">
where Pc(w1|w1) is the probability that word w1
occurs in the same contexts w2 as word w1, aver-
aged over these contexts.
Let w2w1 be two unseen co-occurring words.
We can estimate the conditional probability
P(w2|w1) of the unseen word pair w2w1 by com-
bining estimates for co-occurrences involving
similar words:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9808815">
W(w1,w1)P(w2|w1)
N(w1)

<bodyText confidence="0.928884">
where S(w1) is the set of words most similar to
w1, W(w1,w1) is the similarity function between
w1 and w1, and N(w1) is a normalising factor
N(w1) = ∑w1 W (w1,w1). The conditional proba-
bility PSIM(w2|w1) can be trivially converted to
co-occurrence frequency as follows:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.806835">
(9) f(w1,w2) = PSIM(w2|w1)f(w1)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999593444444444">
Parameter Settings. We experimented with
two approaches to computing P(w2|w1): (1) us-
ing the probability distribution P(n|a), which dis-
covers similar adjectives and treats the noun as
the context; and (2) using P(a|n), which discovers
similar nouns and treats the adjective as the con-
text. These conditional probabilities can be easily
estimated from their relative frequency in the cor-
pus as follows:
</bodyText>

The performance of distance-weighted averaging
depends on two parameters: (1) the number of
items over which the similarity function is com-
puted (i.e., the size of the set S(w1) denoting the
set of words most similar to w1), and (2) the

for the Jensen-Shannon divergence). In this study
we recreated adjective-noun frequencies using
the 1,000 and 2,000 most frequent items (nouns
and adjectives), for both the confusion probabil-
ity and the Jensen-Shannon divergence.3 Further-
more, we set β to .5, which experiments showed
to be the best value for this parameter.
Once we know which words are most simi-
lar to the either the adjective or the noun (irre-
spective of the function used to measure similar-
ity) we can exploit this information in order to
recreate the co-occurrence frequency for unseen
adjective-noun pairs. We use the weighted aver-
age of the evidence provided by the similar words,
where the weight given to a word w1 depends
on its similarity to w1 (see (8) and (9)). Table 2
shows the ten most similar adjectives to the word
proud and then the ten most similar nouns to the
word chief using the Jensen-Shannon divergence

function was calculated over the 1,000 most fre-
quent adjectives in the BNC.

In order to evaluate the smoothing methods intro-

able approximation of the language experience of
a British English speaker.
The experiment used the same set of 30 adjec-
tives discussed in Lapata et al. (1999). These ad-
jectives were chosen to be minimally ambiguous:
each adjective had exactly two senses according
to WordNet and was unambiguously tagged as
‘adjective’ 98.6% of the time, measured as the
number of different part-of-speech tags assigned
to the word in the BNC. For each adjective we
obtained all the nouns (excluding proper nouns)
with which it failed to co-occur in the BNC.
We identified adjective-noun pairs by using
Gsearch (Corley et al., 2001), a chart parser which
detects syntactic patterns in a tagged corpus by
exploiting a user-specified context free grammar
and a syntactic query. From the syntactic anal-
ysis provided by the parser we extracted a ta-
ble containing the adjective and the head of the
noun phrase following it. In the case of compound
nouns, we only included sequences of two nouns,
and considered the rightmost occurring noun as
the head. From the adjective-noun pairs obtained
this way, we removed all pairs where the noun
had a BNC frequency of less than 10 per million,
in order to reduce the risk of plausibility ratings
being influenced by the presence of a noun un-
familiar to the subjects. Each adjective was then
paired with three randomly-chosen nouns from its
list of non-co-occurring nouns. Example stimuli
are shown in Table 3.
Procedure. The experimental paradigm was
magnitude estimation (ME), a technique stan-
dardly used in psychophysics to measure judge-
ments of sensory stimuli (Stevens, 1975), which
Bard et al. (1996) and Cowart (1997) have ap-
plied to the elicitation of linguistic judgements.
The ME procedure requires subjects to estimate
the magnitude of physical stimuli by assigning
numerical values proportional to the stimulus
magnitude they perceive. In contrast to the 5- or
7-point scale conventionally used to measure hu-
man intuitions, ME employs an interval scale, and
therefore produces data for which parametric in-
ferential statistics are valid.
ME requires subjects to assign numbers to
a series of linguistic stimuli in a proportional

fashion. Subjects are first exposed to a modulus
item, which they assign an arbitrary number. All
other stimuli are rated proportional to the modu-
lus. In this way, each subject can establish their
own rating scale, thus yielding maximally fine-
graded data and avoiding the known problems
with the conventional ordinal scales for linguis-
tic data (Bard et al., 1996; Cowart, 1997; Sch¨utze,
1996).
In the present experiment, subjects were pre-
sented with adjective-noun pairs and were asked
to rate the degree of adjective-noun fit propor-
tional to a modulus item. The experiment was car-
ried out using WebExp, a set of Java-Classes for
administering psycholinguistic studies over the
World-Wide Web (Keller et al., 1998). Subjects
first saw a set of instructions that explained the
ME technique and included some examples, and
had to fill in a short questionnaire including basic
demographic information. Each subject saw the
entire set of 90 experimental items.
Subjects. Forty-one native speakers of English
volunteered to participate. Subjects were re-
cruited over the Internet by postings to relevant
newsgroups and mailing lists.

(Plaus) and the three smoothed co-occurrence
frequency estimates: distance-weighted averaging
using Jensen-Shannon divergence (Jen), distance-
weighted averaging using confusion probability

Net (WN). For the two similarity-based measures,
we smoothed either over the similarity of the ad-
jective (subscript a) or over the similarity of the
noun (subscript n). All frequency estimates were
natural log-transformed.
Table 4 displays the results of the corre-
lation analysis. Mean plausibility ratings were
significantly correlated with co-occurrence fre-
quency recreated using our class-based smooth-
ing method based on WordNet (r = .356, p &lt;
.01).
As detailed in Section 2.2, the Jensen-Shannon
divergence and the confusion probability are pa-
rameterised measures. There are two ways to
smooth the frequency of an adjective-noun com-
bination: over the distribution of adjectives or
over the distribution of nouns. We tried both ap-
proaches and found a moderate correlation be-
tween plausibility and both the frequency recre-
ated using distance-weighted averaging and con-
fusion probability. The correlation was significant
both for frequencies recreated by smoothing over
adjectives (r = .214, p &lt; .05) and over nouns
(r = .232, p &lt; .05). However, co-occurrence fre-
quency recreated using the Jensen-Shannon di-
vergence was not reliably correlated with plausi-
bility. Furthermore, there was a reliable correla-
tion between the two Jensen-Shannon measures
Jena and Jenn (r = .781, p &lt; .01), and similarly
between the two confusion measures Confa and
Confn (r = .864, p &lt; .01). We also found a high
correlation between Jena and Confa (r = .941,
p &lt; .01) and Jenn and Confn (r = .956, p &lt; .01).
This indicates that the two similarity measures
yield comparable results for the given task.
We also examined the effect of varying one
further parameter (see Section 2.2). The recre-
ated frequencies were initially estimated using
the n = 1,000 most similar items. We examined
the effects of applying the two smoothing meth-
ods using a set of similar items of twice the size
(n = 2,000). No improvement in terms of the cor-
relations with rated plausibility was found when
using this larger set, whether smoothing over the
adjective or the noun: a moderate correlation with
plausibility was found for Confa (r = .239, p &lt;
.05) and Confn (r = .239, p &lt; .05), while the cor-
relation with Jena and Jenn was not significant.
An important question is how well people agree
in their plausibility judgements. Inter-subject
agreement gives an upper bound for the task and
allows us to interpret how well the smoothing
techniques are doing in relation to the human
judges. We computed the inter-subject correlation
on the elicited judgements using leave-one-out re-
sampling (Weiss and Kulikowski, 1991). Aver-
age inter-subject agreement was .55 (Min = .01,
Max = .76, SD = .16). This means that our ap-
proach performs satisfactorily given that there is
a fair amount of variability in human judgements
of adjective-noun plausibility.
One remaining issue concerns the validity
of our smoothing procedures. We have shown
that co-occurrence frequencies recreated using
smoothing techniques are significantly correlated
with rated plausibility. But this finding consti-
tutes only indirect evidence for the ability of this
method to recreate corpus evidence; it depends on
the assumption that plausibility and frequency are
adequate indicators of each other’s values. Does

smoothing accurately recreate the co-occurrence
frequency of combinations that actually do occur
in the corpus? To address this question, we ap-
plied the class-based smoothing procedure to a
set of adjective-noun pairs that occur in the cor-
pus with varying frequencies, using the materials
from Lapata et al. (1999).
First, we removed all relevant adjective-noun
combinations from the corpus. Effectively we
assumed a linguistic environment with no evi-
dence for the occurrence of the pair, and thus
no evidence for any linguistic relationship be-
tween the adjective and the noun. Then we recre-
ated the co-occurrence frequencies using class-
based smoothing and distance-weighted averag-
ing, and log-transformed the resulting frequen-
cies. Both methods yielded reliable correlation
between recreated frequency and actual BNC fre-
quency (see Table 5 for details). This result pro-
vides additional evidence for the claim that these
smoothing techniques produce reliable frequency
estimates for unseen adjective-noun pairs. Note
that the best correlations were achieved for Confa
and Confn (r = .646, p &lt; .01 and r = .728, p &lt;
.01, respectively).
Finally, we carried out a further test of the
quality of the recreated frequencies by correlat-
ing them with the plausibility judgements re-
ported by Lapata et al. (1999). Again, a signifi-
cant correlation was found for all methods (see
Table 5). However, all correlations were lower
than the correlation of the actual frequencies
with plausibility (r = .570, p &lt; .01) reported
by Lapata et al. (1999). Note also that the con-
fusion probability outperformed Jensen-Shannon
divergence, in line with our results on unfamiliar
adjective-noun pairs.

esting because the class-based method does not
use detailed knowledge about word-to-word rela-
tionships in real language; instead, it relies on the
notion of equivalence classes derived from Word-
Net, a semantic taxonomy. It appears that making
predictions about plausibility is most effectively
done by collapsing together the speaker’s experi-
ence with other words in the semantic class occu-
pied by the target word.
The distance-weighted averaging smoothing
methods yielded a lower correlation with plausi-
bility (in the case of the confusion probability),
or no correlation at all (in the case of the Jensen-
Shannon divergence). The worse performance of
distance-weighted averaging is probably due to
the fact that this method conflates two kinds of
distributional similarity: on the one hand, it gen-
erates words that are semantically similar to the
target word. On the other hand, it also generates
words whose syntactic behaviour is similar to that
of the target word. Rated plausibility, however,
seems to be more sensitive to semantic than to
syntactic similarity.
As an example refer to Table 6, which displays
the ten most distributionally similar words to the
adjectives guilty and dangerous and to the nouns
stop and giant discovered by the Jensen-Shannon
measure. The set of similar words is far from se-
mantically coherent. As far as the adjective guilty
is concerned the measure discovered antonyms
such as innocent and honest. Semantically unre-
lated adjectives such as injured, democratic, or in-
terested are included; it seems that their syntactic
behaviour is similar to that of guilty, e.g., they all
co-occur with party. The same pattern can be ob-
served for the adjective dangerous, to which none
of the discovered adjectives are intuitively seman-
tically related, perhaps with the exception of bad.
The set of words most similar to the noun stop
also does not appear to be semantically coherent.
This problem with distance-weighted averag-
ing is aggravated by the fact that the adjective
or noun that we smooth over can be polysemous.
Take the set of similar words for giant, for in-
stance. The words company, manufacturer, indus-
try and firm are similar to the ‘enterprise’ sense
of giant, whereas artist, star, master are similar
to the ‘important/influential person’ sense of gi-
ant. However, no similar word was found for ei-
ther the ‘beast’ or ‘heavyweight person’ sense of
giant. This illustrates that the distance-weighted
averaging approach fails to take proper account
of the polysemy of a word. The class-based ap-
proach, on the other hand, relies on WordNet, a
lexical taxonomy that can be expected to cover
most senses of a given lexical item.
Recall that distance-weighted averaging dis-
covers distributionally similar words by look-
ing at simple lexical co-occurrence information.
In the case of adjective-noun pairs we concen-
trated on combinations found in the corpus in
a head-modifier relationship. This limited form
of surface-syntactic information does not seem
to be sufficient to reproduce the detailed knowl-
edge that people have about the semantic relation-
ships between words. Our class-based smoothing
method, on the other hand, relies on the semantic
taxonomy of WordNet, where fine-grained con-
ceptual knowledge about words and their rela-
tions is encoded. This knowledge can be used to
create semantically coherent equivalence classes.
Such classes will not contain antonyms or items
whose behaviour is syntactically related, but not
semantically similar, to the words of interest.
To summarise, it appears that distance-
weighted averaging smoothing is only partially
successful in reproducing the linguistic depen-
dencies that characterise and constrain the forma-
tion of adjective-noun combinations. The class-
based smoothing method, however, relies on a
pre-defined taxonomy that allows these depen-
dencies to be inferred, and thus reliably estimates
the plausibility of adjective-noun combinations
that fail to co-occur in the corpus.

4 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999974086956522">
This paper investigated the validity of smoothing
techniques by using them to recreate the frequen-
cies of adjective-noun pairs that fail to occur in
a 100 million word corpus. We showed that the
recreated frequencies are significantly correlated
with plausibility judgements. These results were
then extended by applying the same smoothing
techniques to adjective-noun pairs that occur in
the corpus. These recreated frequencies were sig-
nificantly correlated with the actual frequencies,
as well as with plausibility judgements.
Our results provide independent evidence for
the validity of the smoothing techniques we em-
ployed. In contrast to previous work, our evalu-
ation does not presuppose that the recreated fre-
quencies are used in a specific natural language
processing task. Rather, we established an in-
dependent criterion for the validity of smooth-
ing techniques by comparing them to plausibil-
ity judgements, which are known to correlate
with co-occurrence frequency. We also carried
out a comparison of different smoothing meth-
ods, and found that class-based smoothing outper-
forms distance-weighted averaging.4
From a practical point of view, our findings
provide a very simple account of adjective-
noun plausibility. Extending the results of
Lapata et al. (1999), we confirmed that co-
occurrence frequency can be used to estimate the
plausibility of an adjective-noun pair. If no co-
occurrence counts are available from the corpus,
then counts can be recreated using the corpus and
a structured source of taxonomic knowledge (for
the class-based approach). Distance-weighted
averaging can be seen as a ‘cheap’ way to obtain
this sort of taxonomic knowledge. However, this
method does not draw upon semantic informa-
tion only, but is also sensitive to the syntactic
distribution of the target word. This explains the
fact that distance-weighted averaging yielded
a lower correlation with perceived plausibility
than class-based smoothing. A taxonomy like
WordNet provides a cleaner source of conceptual
information, which captures essential aspects of
the type of knowledge needed for assessing the
plausibility of an adjective-noun combination.

This simplification is necessary unless we have a corpus of adjectivenoun pairs labelled explicitly with taxonomic information.2 Consider the pair proud chief which is not attested in the British National Corpus (BNC) (Burnard, 1995). The word chief has two senses in WordNet and belongs to seven conceptual classes (causal agent, entity, leader, life form, person, superior, and supervisor) This means that the cooccurrence frequency of the adjective-noun pair will be constructed for each of the seven classes, as shown in Table 1.

A classical example is strong tea, which is highly plausible, as opposed to powerful tea, which is not. On the other hand, powerful car is highly plausible, whereas strong car is less plausible. It has been argued in the theoretical literature that the plausibility of an adjective-noun pair is largely a collocational (i.e., idiosyncratic) property, in contrast to verb-object or noun-noun plausibility, which is more predictable (Cruse, 1986; Smadja, 1991). The collocational hypothesis has recently been investigated in a corpus study by Lapata et al. (1999). This study investigated potential statistical predictors of adjective-noun plausibility by using correlation analysis to compare judgements elicited from human subjects with five corpus-derived measures: co-occurrence frequency of the adjective-noun pair, noun frequency, conditional probability of the noun given the adjective, the log-likelihood ratio, and Resnik’s (1993) selectional association measure.

The problem arises when the probability of word combinations that do not occur in the training data needs to be estimated. The smoothing methods proposed in the literature (overviews are provided by Dagan et al. (1999) and Lee (1999)) can be generally divided into three types: discounting (Katz, 1987), class-based smoothing (Resnik, 1993; Brown et al., 1992; Pereira et al., 1993), and distance-weighted averaging (Grishman and Sterling, 1994; Dagan et al., 1999). Discounting methods decrease the probability of previously seen events so that the total probability of observed word co-occurrences is less than one, leaving some probability mass to be redistributed among unseen co-occurrences.

Classes can be induced directly from the corpus (Pereira et al., 1993; Brown et al., 1992) or taken from a manually crafted taxonomy (Resnik, 1993). In the latter case the taxonomy is used to provide a mapping from words to conceptual classes. In language modelling, smoothing techniques are typically evaluated by showing that a language model which uses smoothed estimates incurs a reduction in perplexity on test data over a model that does not employ smoothed estimates (Katz, 1987). Dagan et al. (1999) use perplexity to compare back-off smoothing against distanceweighted averaging methods and show that the latter outperform the former. They also compare different distance-weighted averaging methods on a pseudo-word disambiguation task where the language model decides which of two verbs v1 and v2 is more likely to take a noun n as its object. The method being tested must reconstruct which of the unseen (v1,n) and (v2,n) is a valid verb-object combination.

Consider the verbs see and polymerise: intuitively there is a great variety of things which can be seen, whereas there is a very specific set of things which can be polymerised (e.g., ethylene). Resnik demonstrated that his measure of selectional association successfully captures this intuition: selectional association values are correlated with verbargument plausibility as judged by native speakers. However, Lapata et al. (1999) found that the success of selectional association as a predictor of plausibility does not seem to carry over to adjective-noun plausibility. There are two potential reasons for this: (1) the semantic restrictions that adjectives impose on the nouns with which they combine appear to be less strict than the ones imposed by verbs (consider the adjective superb which can combine with nearly any noun); and (2) given their lexicalist nature, adjectivenoun combinations may defy selectional restrictions yet be intuitively plausible (consider the pair sad day, where sadness is not an attribute of day)</context>

These adjectives were chosen to be minimally ambiguous: each adjective had exactly two senses according to WordNet and was unambiguously tagged as ‘adjective’ 98.6% of the time, measured as the number of different part-of-speech tags assigned to the word in the BNC. For each adjective we obtained all the nouns (excluding proper nouns) with which it failed to co-occur in the BNC. We identified adjective-noun pairs by using Gsearch (Corley et al., 2001), a chart parser which detects syntactic patterns in a tagged corpus by exploiting a user-specified context free grammar and a syntactic query.</context>

To address this question, we applied the class-based smoothing procedure to a set of adjective-noun pairs that occur in the corpus with varying frequencies, using the materials from Lapata et al. (1999). First, we removed all relevant adjective-noun combinations from the corpus. Effectively we assumed a linguistic environment with no evidence for the occurrence of the pair, and thus no evidence for any linguistic relationship between the adjective and the noun. Then we recreated the co-occurrence frequencies using classbased smoothing and distance-weighted averaging, and log-transformed the resulting frequencies. Both methods yielded reliable correlation between recreated frequency and actual BNC frequency (see Table 5 for details). This result provides additional evidence for the claim that</context>

Finally, we carried out a further test of the quality of the recreated frequencies by correlating them with the plausibility judgements reported by Lapata et al. (1999). Again, a significant correlation was found for all methods (see Table 5). However, all correlations were lower than the correlation of the actual frequencies with plausibility (r = .570, p &lt; .01) reported by Lapata et al. (1999). Note also that the confusion probability outperformed Jensen-Shannon divergence, in line with our results on unfamiliar adjective-noun pairs. 3.3 Discussion Lapata et al. (1999) demonstrated that the cooccurrence frequency of an adjective-noun combination is the best predictor of its rated plausibility. The present experiment extended this result to adjective-noun pairs that do not co-occur in the corpus.

Rather, we established an independent criterion for the validity of smoothing techniques by comparing them to plausibility judgements, which are known to correlate with co-occurrence frequency. We also carried out a comparison of different smoothing methods, and found that class-based smoothing outperforms distance-weighted averaging.4 From a practical point of view, our findings provide a very simple account of adjectivenoun plausibility. Extending the results of Lapata et al. (1999), we confirmed that cooccurrence frequency can be used to estimate the plausibility of an adjective-noun pair. If no cooccurrence counts are available from the corpus, then counts can be recreated using the corpus and a structured source of taxonomic knowledge (for the class-based approach). Distance-weighted averaging can be seen as a ‘cheap’ way to obtain this sort of taxonomic knowledge. However, this method does not draw upon semantic information only, but is also sensitive to the syntactic distribution of the target word.

The problem arises when the probability of word combinations that do not occur in the training data needs to be estimated. The smoothing methods proposed in the literature (overviews are provided by Dagan et al. (1999) and Lee (1999)) can be generally divided into three types: discounting (Katz, 1987), class-based smoothing (Resnik, 1993; Brown et al., 1992; Pereira et al., 1993), and distance-weighted averaging (Grishman and Sterling, 1994; Dagan et al., 1999). Discounting methods decrease the probability of previously seen events so that the total probability of observed word co-occurrences is less than one, leaving some probability mass to be redistributed among unseen co-occurrences. Class-based smoothing and distance-weighted averaging both rely on an intuitively simple idea: inter-word dependencies are modelled by r</context>

A key feature of this type of smoothing is the function which measures distributional similarity from cooccurrence frequencies. Several measures of distributional similarity have been proposed in the literature (Dagan et al., 1999; Lee, 1999). We used two measures, the Jensen-Shannon divergence and the confusion probability. Those two measures have been previously shown to give promising performance for the task of estimating the frequencies of unseen verb-argument pairs (Dagan et al., 1999; Grishman and Sterling, 1994; Lapata, 2000; Lee, 1999). In the following we describe these two similarity measures and show how they can be used to recreate the frequencies for unseen adjective-noun pairs. Jensen-Shannon Divergence.

Section 3 details our judgement elicitation experiment and reports our results. 2.1 Class-based Smoothing We recreated co-occurrence frequencies for unseen adjective-noun pairs using a simplified version of Resnik’s (1993) selectional association measure. Selectional association is defined as the amount of information a given predicate carries about its argument, where the argument is represented by its corresponding classes in a taxonomy such as WordNet (Miller et al., 1990). This means that predicates which impose few restrictions on their arguments have low selectional association values, whereas predicates selecting for a restricted number of arguments have high selectional association values. Consider the verbs see and polymerise: intuitively there is a great variety of things which can be seen, whereas there is a very specific set of things which can be polymerised (e.g., ethylene). Resnik demonstrated that his measure of selectional association successfully captures this intuition: selectional association values are correlated with verbargument plausibility</context>

A classical example is strong tea, which is highly plausible, as opposed to powerful tea, which is not. On the other hand, powerful car is highly plausible, whereas strong car is less plausible. It has been argued in the theoretical literature that the plausibility of an adjective-noun pair is largely a collocational (i.e., idiosyncratic) property, in contrast to verb-object or noun-noun plausibility, which is more predictable (Cruse, 1986; Smadja, 1991). The collocational hypothesis has recently been investigated in a corpus study by Lapata et al. (1999). This study investigated potential statistical predictors of adjective-noun plausibility by using correlation analysis to compare judgements elicited from human subjects with five corpus-derived measures: co-occurrence frequency of the adjective-noun pair, noun frequency, conditional probability of the noun given the adjective, the log-likelihood ratio, and Resnik’s (1993) selectional association measure. All predictors but one were positively correlated with plausibility; the highest correl</context>

From the adjective-noun pairs obtained this way, we removed all pairs where the noun had a BNC frequency of less than 10 per million, in order to reduce the risk of plausibility ratings being influenced by the presence of a noun unfamiliar to the subjects. Each adjective was then paired with three randomly-chosen nouns from its list of non-co-occurring nouns. Example stimuli are shown in Table 3. Procedure. The experimental paradigm was magnitude estimation (ME), a technique standardly used in psychophysics to measure judgements of sensory stimuli (Stevens, 1975), which Bard et al. (1996) and Cowart (1997) have applied to the elicitation of linguistic judgements. The ME procedure requires subjects to estimate the magnitude of physical stimuli by assigning numerical values proportional to the stimulus magnitude they perceive. In contrast to the 5- or 7-point scale conventionally used to measure human intuitions, ME employs an interval scale, and therefore produces data for which parametric inferential statistics are valid. ME requires subjects to assign numbers to a series of linguistic stimuli in a proportional Plaus Jena Confa Jenn Confn Jena .058 Co</context>

An important question is how well people agree in their plausibility judgements. Inter-subject agreement gives an upper bound for the task and allows us to interpret how well the smoothing techniques are doing in relation to the human judges. We computed the inter-subject correlation on the elicited judgements using leave-one-out resampling (Weiss and Kulikowski, 1991). Average inter-subject agreement was .55 (Min = .01, Max = .76, SD = .16). This means that our approach performs satisfactorily given that there is a fair amount of variability in human judgements of adjective-noun plausibility. One remaining issue concerns the validity of our smoothing procedures. We have shown that co-occurrence frequencies recreated using smoothing techniques are significantly correlated with rated plausibility. But this finding constitutes only indirect evidence for the ability of this method to recreate corpus evidence; it depends on the assumption that plausibility and </context>
