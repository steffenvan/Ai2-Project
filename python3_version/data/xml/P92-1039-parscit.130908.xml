Consideration of when Right Association works and
when it fails lead to a restatement of this parsing prin-
ciple in terms of the notion of heaviness. A computa-
tional investigation of a syntactically annotated corpus
provides evidence for this proposal and suggest circum-
stances when RA is likely to make correct attachment
predictions.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999597333333333">
Kimball (1973) proposes the parsing strategy of Right
Association (RA). RA resolves modifiers attachment am-
biguities by attaching at the lowest syntactically per-
missible position along the right frontier. Many au-
thors (among them Wilks 1985, Schubert 1986, Whit-
temore et al. 1990, and Weischedel et al. 1991) in-
corporate RA into their parsing systems, yet none rely
on it solely, integrating it instead with disambiguation
preferences derived from word/constituent/concept co-
occurrence based. On its own, RA performs rather well,
given its simplicity, but it is far from adequate: Whitte-
more et al. evaluate RA&apos;s performance on PP attachment
using a corpus derived from computer-mediated dialog.
They find that RA makes correct predictions 55% of the
time. Weischedel et al., using a corpus of news sto-
ries, report a 75% success rate on the general case of
attachment using a strategy Closest Attachment which
is essentially RA. In the work cited above, RA plays a
relatively minor role, as compared with co-occurrence
based preferences.
The status of RA is very puzzling. consider:

On the one hand, many naive informants do not see the
ambiguity of la and are often confused by the putatively
semantically unambiguous lb — a strong RA effect. On
the other hand (2) violates RA with impunity. What is
it that makes RA operate so strongly in 1 but disappear
in 2? In this paper I argue that it is an aspect of the
declarative linguistic competence that is operating here,
not a principle of parsing.

2 Heaviness
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998117555555555">
Quirk et al. (1985) define end weight as the ten-
dency to place material with more information content
after material with less information content. This notion
is closely related with end focus which is stated in terms
of importance of the contribution of the constituent, (not
merely the quantity of lexical material.) These two prin-
ciples operate in an additive fashion. Quirk et al. use
heaviness to account for a variety of phenomena, among
them:

<bodyText confidence="0.9997069">
Heaviness clearly plays a role in modifier attach-
ment, as shown in table 1. My claim is that what is
wrong with sentences such as (1) is the violation, in the
high attachment, of the principle of end weight. While
violations of the principle of end weight in unambigu-
ous sentences (e.g. those in table 1) cause little grief,
as they are easily accommodated by the hearer, the on-
line decision process of disambiguation)could well be
much more sensitive to small differences in the degree
of violation. In particular, it would seem that in (1)b,

the heaviness-based preference for low attachment has a
chance to influence the parser before the inference-based
preference for high attachment.
The precise definition of heaviness is an open prob-
lem. It is not clear whether end weight and end focus ad-
equately capture all of its subtlety. For the present study
I approximate heaviness by easily computable means,
namely the presence of a clause within a given con-
stituent.

3 A study
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997926">
The consequence of my claim is that light adverbials
cannot be placed after heavy VP arguments, while heavy
adverbials are not subject to such a constraint. When the
speaker wishes to convey the information in (1)a, there
are other word-orders available, namely,
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.99114">
(3) a. Yesterday John said that Bill left.
b. John said yesterday that Bill left.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9996939375">
If the claim is correct then when a short adverbial modi-
fies a VP which contains a heavy argument, the adverbial
will appear either before the VP or between the verb and
the argument. Heavy adverbials should be immune from
this constraint.
To verify this prediction, I conducted an investi-
gation of the Penn Treebank corpus of about 1 mil-
lion words syntactically annotated text from the Wall
Street Journal. Unfortunately, the corpus does not dis-
tinguish between arguments and adjuncts — they&apos;re both
annotated as daughters of VP. Since at this time, I do
not have a dictionary-based method for distinguishing
(VP asked (3- when...)) from (VP left (3 when...)), my
search cannot include all adverbials, only those which
could never (or rarely) serve as arguments. I therefore
restricted my search to subgroups of the adverbials.

here too recently instead often later once yet previ-
ously especially again earlier soon ever first indeed
sharply largely usually together quickly closely di-
rectly alone sometimes yesterday
The particular words were chosen solely on the basis
of frequency in the corpus, without &apos;peeking&apos; at their
word-order behavior&apos;.
For arguments, I only considered NPs and 3s with
complementizer that, and the zero complementizer.
The results of this investigation appear the following
adverbial: single word clausal
arg type pre-arg post-arg pre-arg post-arg
light 760 399 13 597
heavy 267 5 7 45
total 1027 404 20 642
Of 1431 occurrences of single word adverbials, 404
(28.2%) appear after the argument. If we consider only
cases where the verb takes a heavy argument (defined as
one which contains an S), of the 273 occurrences, only
5 (1.8%) appear after the argument. This interaction
with heaviness of the argument is statistically significant
(x2 = 115.5,p &lt; .001).
Clausal adverbials tend to be placed after the verbal
argument: only 20 out of the 662 occurrences of clausal
adverbials appear at a position before the argument of
the verb. Even when the argument is heavy, clausal
adverbials appear on the right: 45 out of a total of 52
clausal adverbials (86.5%).
(2) and (4) are two examples of RA-violating sen-
tences which I have found.
(4) Bankruptcy specialists say Mr. Kravis set a
precedent for putting new money in sour LBOs
recently when KKR restructured foundering Sea-
man Furniture, doubling KKR&apos;s equity stake.
To summarize: light adverbials tend to appear be-
fore a heavy argument and heavy adverbials tend to ap-
pear after it. The prediction is thus confirmed.
I Each adverbial can appear in at least one position before the argu-
ment to the verb (sentence initial, preverb, between verb and argument)
and at least one post-verbal-argument position (end of VP, end of S).

RA is at a loss to explain this sensitivity to heavi-
ness. But even a revision of RA, such as the one pro-
posed&apos; by Schubert (1986) which is sensitive to the size
of the modifier and of the modified constituent, would
still require additional stipulation to explain the apparent
conspiracy between a parsing strategy and tendencies
in generator to produce sentences with the word-order
properties observed above.

<bodyText confidence="0.95905795">
How can we exploit the findings above in our design of
practical parsers? Clearly RA seems to work extremely
well for single word adverbials, but how about clausal
adverbials? To investigate this, I conducted another
search of the corpus, this time considering only ambigu-
ous attachment sites. I found all structures matching the
following two low-attached schemata2
low VP attached: [vp [s * [vp * adv *] *]...1
low S attached: [vp [s * adv *1 ...]
and the following two high-attached schemata
high VP attached: [vp v * [... [s ]] adv *)
high S attached: Es * [... [vp Es 1]1 adv * ]
The results are summarized in the following table:
adverb-type low-attached high-att. % high.
single word 1116 10 0.8%
clausal 817 194 19.2%
As expected, with single-word adverbials, RA is al-
most always right, failing only 0.8% of the time. How-
ever, with clausal adverbials, RA is incorrect almost one
out of five times.

5 Toward a Meaning-based ac-
count of Heaviness
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999879909090909">
At the end of section 3 I stated that a declarative ac-
count of the ill-formedness of a heavy argument fol-
lowed by a light modifier is more parsimonious than
separate accounts for parsing preferences and generation
preferences. I would like to suggest that it is possible to
formalize the intuition of &apos;heaviness&apos; in terms of an as-
pect of the meaning of the constituents involved, namely
their givenness in the discourse.
Given entities tend to require short expressions (typ-
ically pronouns) for reactivation, whereas new entities
tend to be introduced with more elaborated expressions.

mean constituent x contains constituent y as a rightmost descendant.
By Ix ... Ey I ... I mean constituent x contains constituent y as a
descendant.
In fact, it is possible to manipulate heaviness by chang-
ing the context. For example, (1)b is natural in the
following dialog3 (when appropriately intoned)
A: John said that Bill will leave next week, and that
Mary will go on sabbatical in September.
B: Oh really? When announce all this?
A: He said that Bill will leave yesterday, and he told
us about Mary&apos;s sabbatical this morning.

6 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999258125">
I have argued that the apparent variability in the applica-
bility of Right Association can be explained if we con-
sider the heaviness of the constituents involved. I have
demonstrated that in at least one written genre, light
adverbials are rarely produced after heavy arguments —
precisely the configuration which causes the strongest
RA-type effects. This demarcates a subset of attach-
ment ambiguities where it is quite profitable to use RA
as an approximation of the human sentence processor.
The work reported here considers only a subset of
the attachment data in the corpus. The corpus itself rep-
resents a very narrow genre of written discourse. For the
central claim to be valid, the findings must be replicated
on a corpus of naturally occurring spontaneous speech.
A rigorous account of heaviness is also required. These
await further research.
