This paper introduces an integrative approach
to automatic word sense subjectivity annota-
tion. We use features that exploit the hier-
archical structure and domain information in
lexical resources such as WordNet, as well as
other types of features that measure the sim-
ilarity of glosses and the overlap among sets
of semantically related words. Integrated in a
machine learning framework, the entire set of
features is found to give better results than any
individual type of feature.

Automatic extraction of opinions, emotions, and
sentiments in text (subjectivity analysis) to support
applications such as product review mining, sum-
marization, question answering, and information ex-
traction is an active area of research in NLP.
Many approaches to opinion, sentiment, and sub-
jectivity analysis rely on lexicons of words that may
be used to express subjectivity. However, words may
have both subjective and objective senses, which is
a source of ambiguity in subjectivity and sentiment
analysis. We show that even words judged in pre-
vious work to be reliable clues of subjectivity have
significant degrees of subjectivity sense ambiguity.
To address this ambiguity, we present a method
for automatically assigning subjectivity labels to
word senses in a taxonomy, which uses new features
and integrates more diverse types of knowledge than
in previous work. We focus on nouns, which are
challenging and have received less attention in auto-
matic subjectivity and sentiment analysis.
A common approach to building lexicons for sub-
jectivity analysis is to begin with a small set of
seeds which are prototypically subjective (or posi-
tive/negative, in sentiment analysis), and then fol-
low semantic links in WordNet-like resources. By
far, the emphasis has been on horizontal relations,
such as synonymy and antonymy. Exploiting vertical
links opens the door to taking into account the infor-
mation content of ancestor concepts of senses with
known and unknown subjectivity. We develop novel
features that measure the similarity of a target word
sense with a seed set of senses known to be sub-
jective, where the similarity between two concepts
is determined by the extent to which they share in-
formation, measured by the information content as-
sociated with their least common subsumer (LCS).
Further, particularizing the LCS features to domain
greatly reduces calculation while still maintaining
effective features.
We find that our new features do lead to signif-
icant improvements over methods proposed in pre-
vious work, and that the combination of all features
gives significantly better performance than any sin-
gle type of feature alone.
We also ask, given that there are many approaches
to finding subjective words, if it would make sense
for word- and sense-level approaches to work in tan-
dem, or should we best view them as competing ap-
proaches? We give evidence suggesting that first
identifying subjective words and then disambiguat-
ing their senses would be an effective approach to
subjectivity sense labeling.

There are several motivations for assigning sub-
jectivity labels to senses. First, (Wiebe and Mi-
halcea, 2006) provide evidence that word sense la-
bels, together with contextual subjectivity analysis,
can be exploited to improve performance in word
sense disambiguation. Similarly, given subjectivity
sense labels, word-sense disambiguation may poten-
tially help contextual subjectivity analysis. In addi-
tion, as lexical resources such as WordNet are devel-
oped further, subjectivity labels would provide prin-
cipled criteria for refining word senses, as well as for
clustering similar meanings to create more course-
grained sense inventories.
For many opinion mining applications, polarity
(positive, negative) is also important. The overall
framework we envision is a layered approach: clas-
sifying instances as objective or subjective, and fur-
ther classifying the subjective instances by polar-
ity. Decomposing the problem into subproblems has
been found to be effective for opinion mining. This
paper addresses the first of these subproblems.

2 Background
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996403814285715">
We adopt the definitions of subjective and objective
from Wiebe and Mihalcea (2006) (hereafter WM).
Subjective expressions are words and phrases being
used to express opinions, emotions, speculations,
etc. WM give the following examples:
His alarm grew.
He absorbed the information quickly.
UCC/Disciples leaders roundly condemned the
Iranian President’s verbal assault on Israel.
What’s the catch?
Polarity (also called semantic orientation) is also
important to NLP applications in sentiment analysis
and opinion extraction. In review mining, for exam-
ple, we want to know whether an opinion about a
product is positive or negative. Even so, we believe
there are strong motivations for a separate subjec-
tive/objective (S/O) classification as well.
First, expressions may be subjective but not have
any particular polarity. An example given by (Wil-
son et al., 2005) is Jerome says the hospital feels
no different than a hospital in the states. An NLP
application system may want to find a wide range
of private states attributed to a person, such as their
motivations, thoughts, and speculations, in addition
to their positive and negative sentiments.
Second, distinguishing S and O instances has of-
ten proven more difficult than subsequent polarity
classification. Researchers have found this at vari-
ous levels of analysis, including the manual anno-
tation of phrases (Takamura et al., 2006), sentiment
classification of phrases (Wilson et al., 2005), sen-
timent tagging of words (Andreevskaia and Bergler,
2006b), and sentiment tagging of word senses (Esuli
and Sebastiani, 2006a). Thus, effective methods for
S/O classification promise to improve performance
for sentiment classification. In fact, researchers in
sentiment analysis have realized benefits by decom-
posing the problem into S/O and polarity classifica-
tion (Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003; Pang and Lee,
2004; Wilson et al., 2005; Kim and Hovy, 2006).
One reason is that different features may be relevant
for the two subproblems. For example, negation fea-
tures are more important for polarity classification
than for subjectivity classification.
Note that some of our features require vertical
links that are present in WordNet for nouns and
verbs but not for other parts of speech. Thus we ad-
dress nouns (leaving verbs to future work). There
are other motivations for focusing on nouns. Rela-
tively little work in subjectivity and sentiment anal-
ysis has focused on subjective nouns. Also, a study
(Bruce and Wiebe, 1999) showed that, of the major
parts of speech, nouns are the most ambiguous with
respect to the subjectivity of their instances.
Turning to word senses, we adopt the definitions
from WM. First, subjective: “Classifying a sense as
S means that, when the sense is used in a text or con-
versation, we expect it to express subjectivity; we
also expect the phrase or sentence containing it to
be subjective [WM, pp. 2-3].”
In WM, it is noted that sentences containing ob-
jective senses may not be objective, as in the sen-
tence Will someone shut that darn alarm off? Thus,
objective senses are defined as follows: “Classifying
a sense as O means that, when the sense is used in a
text or conversation, we do not expect it to express
subjectivity and, if the phrase or sentence containing
it is subjective, the subjectivity is due to something
else [WM, p 3].”

Many methods have been developed for automati-
cally identifying subjective (opinion, sentiment, at-
titude, affect-bearing, etc.) words, e.g., (Turney,
2002; Riloff and Wiebe, 2003; Kim and Hovy, 2004;
Taboada et al., 2006; Takamura et al., 2006).
Five groups have worked on subjectivity sense la-
beling. WM and Su and Markert (2008) (hereafter
SM) assign S/O labels to senses, while Esuli and Se-
bastiani (hereafter ES) (2006a; 2007), Andreevskaia
and Bergler (hereafter AB) (2006b; 2006a), and
(Valitutti et al., 2004) assign polarity labels.
WM, SM, and ES have evaluated their systems
against manually annotated word-sense data. WM’s
annotations are described above; SM’s are similar.
In the scheme ES use (Cerini et al., 2007), senses
are assigned three scores, for positivity, negativity,
and neutrality. There is no unambiguous mapping
between the labels of WM/SM and ES, first because
WM/SM use distinct classes and ES use numerical
ratings, and second because WM/SM distinguish be-
tween objective senses on the one hand and neutral
subjective senses on the other, while those are both
neutral in the scheme used by ES.
WM use an unsupervised corpus-based approach,
in which subjectivity labels are assigned to word
senses based on a set of distributionally similar
words in a corpus annotated with subjective expres-
sions. SM explore methods that use existing re-
sources that do not require manually annotated data;
they also implement a supervised system for com-
parison, which we will call SMsup. The other three
groups start with positive and negative seed sets and
expand them by adding synonyms and antonyms,
and traversing horizontal links in WordNet. AB, ES,
and SMsup additionally use information contained
in glosses; AB also use hyponyms; SMsup also uses
relation and POS features. AB perform multiple
runs of their system to assign fuzzy categories to
senses. ES use a semi-supervised, multiple-classifier
learning approach. In a later paper, (Esuli and Se-
bastiani, 2007), ES again use information in glosses,
applying a random walk ranking algorithm to a
graph in which synsets are linked if a member of
the first synset appears in the gloss of the second.
Like ES and SMsup, we use machine learning, but
with more diverse sources of knowledge. Further,
several of our features are novel for the task. The
LCS features (Section 6.1) detect subjectivity by
measuring the similarity of a candidate word sense
with a seed set. WM also use a similarity measure,
but as a way to filter the output of a measure of distri-
butional similarity (selecting words for a given word
sense), not as we do to cumulatively calculate the
subjectivity of a word sense. Another novel aspect
of our similarity features is that they are particular-
ized to domain, which greatly reduces calculation.
The domain subjectivity LCS features (Section 6.2)
are also novel for our task. So is augmenting seed
sets with monosemous words, for greater coverage
without requiring human intervention or sacrificing
quality. Note that none of our features as we specif-
ically define them has been used in previous work;
combining them together, our approach outperforms
previous approaches.

4 Lexicon and Annotations
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999987617647059">
We use the subjectivity lexicon of (Wiebe and Riloff,
2005)1 both to create a subjective seed set and to
create the experimental data sets. The lexicon is a
list of words and phrases that have subjective uses,
though only word entries are used in this paper (i.e.,
we do not address phrases at this point). Some en-
tries are from manually developed resources, includ-
ing the General Inquirer, while others were derived
from corpora using automatic methods.
Through manual review and empirical testing on
data, (Wiebe and Riloff, 2005) divided the clues into
strong (strongsubj) and weak (weaksubj) subjectiv-
ity clues. Strongsubj clues have subjective meanings
with high probability, and weaksubj clues have sub-
jective meanings with lower probability.
To support our experiments, we annotated the
senses2 of polysemous nouns selected from the lex-
icon, using WM’s annotation scheme described in
Section 2. Due to time constraints, only some of the
data was labeled through consensus labeling by two
annotators; the rest was labeled by one annotator.
Overall, 2875 senses for 882 words were anno-
tated. Even though all are senses of words from the
subjectivity lexicon, only 1383 (48%) of the senses
are subjective.
The words labeled strongsubj are in fact less am-
biguous than those labeled weaksubj in our analysis,
thus supporting the reliability classifications in the
lexicon. 55% (1038/1924) of the senses of strong-
subj words are subjective, while only 36% (345/951)
of the senses of weaksubj words are subjective.
For the analysis in Section 7.3, we form subsets
of the data annotated here to test performance of our
method on different data compositions.

<bodyText confidence="0.99997125">
Both subjective and objective seed sets are used to
define the features described below. For seeds, a
large number is desirable for greater coverage, al-
though high quality is also important. We begin to
build our subjective seed set by adding the monose-
mous strongsubj nouns of the subjectivity lexicon
(there are 397 of these). Since they are monose-
mous, they pose no problem of sense ambiguity. We

then expand the set with their hyponyms, as they
were found useful in previous work by AB (2006b;
2006a). This yields a subjective seed set of 645
senses. After removing the word senses that belong
to the same synset, so that only one word sense per
synset is left, we ended up with 603 senses.
To create the objective seed set, two annotators
manually annotated 800 random senses from Word-
Net, and selected for the objective seed set the ones
they both agreed are clearly objective. This creates
an objective seed set of 727. Again we removed
multiple senses from the same synset leaving us with
722. The other 73 senses they annotated are added
to the mixed data set described below. As this sam-
pling shows, WordNet nouns are highly skewed to-
ward objective senses, so finding an objective seed
set is not difficult.

6 Features
</sectionHeader>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999538">
6.1 Sense Subjectivity LCS Feature
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999980192307692">
This feature measures the similarity of a target sense
with members of the subjective seed set. Here, sim-
ilarity between two senses is determined by the ex-
tent to which they share information, measured by
using the information content associated with their
least common subsumer. For an intuition behind this
feature, consider this example. In WordNet, the hy-
pernym of the “strong criticism” sense of attack is
criticism. Several other negative subjective senses
are descendants of criticism, including the relevant
senses of fire, thrust, and rebuke. Going up one
more level, the hypernym of criticism is the “ex-
pression of disapproval” meaning of disapproval,
which has several additional negative subjective de-
scendants, such as the “expression of opposition and
disapproval” sense of discouragement. Our hypoth-
esis is that the cases where subjectivity is preserved
in the hypernym structure, or where hypernyms do
lead from subjective senses to others, are the ones
that have the highest least common subsumer score
with the seed set of known subjective senses.
We calculate similarity using the information-
content based measure proposed in (Resnik, 1995),
as implemented in the WordNet::Similarity pack-
age (using the default option in which LCS values
are computed over the SemCor corpus).3 Given a

taxonomy such as WordNet, the information con-
tent associated with a concept is determined as the
likelihood of encountering that concept, defined as
−log(p(C)), where p(C) is the probability of see-
ing concept C in a corpus. The similarity between
two concepts is then defined in terms of information
content as: LCSs(C1, C2) = max[−log(p(C))],
where C is the concept that subsumes both C1 and
C2 and has the highest information content (i.e., it is
the least common subsumer (LCS)).
For this feature, a score is assigned to a target
sense based on its semantic similarity to the mem-
bers of a seed set; in particular, the maximum such
similarity is used.
For a target sense t and a seed set S, we could
have used the following score:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.989582">
Score(t, S) = max
sES
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999797818181818">
However, several researchers have noted that sub-
jectivity may be domain specific. A version of
WordNet exists, WordNet Domains (Gliozzo et al.,
2005), which associates each synset with one of the
domains in the Dewey Decimal library classifica-
tion. After sorting our subjective seed set into differ-
ent domains, we observed that over 80% of the sub-
jective seed senses are concentrated in six domains
(the rest are distributed among 35 domains).
Thus, we decided to particularize the semantic
similarity feature to domain, such that only the sub-
set of the seed set in the same domain as the tar-
get sense is used to compute the feature. This in-
volves much less calculation, as LCS values are cal-
culated only with respect to a subset of the seed set.
We hypothesized that this would still be an effec-
tive feature, while being more efficient to calculate.
This will be important when this method is applied
to large resources such as the entire WordNet.
Thus, for seed set S and target sense t which is
in domain D, the feature is defined as the following
score:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.945409">
SenseLCSscore(t, D, S) = max
dEDnS
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999791">
The seed set is a parameter, so we could have
defined a feature reflecting similarity to the objec-
tive seed set as well. Since WordNet is already
highly skewed toward objective noun senses, any
naive classifier need only guess the majority class
for high accuracy for the objective senses. We in-
cluded only a subjective feature to put more empha-
sis on the subjective senses. In the future, features
could be defined with respect to objectivity, as well
as polarity and other properties of subjectivity.

6.3 Common Related Senses

<bodyText confidence="0.9999302">
This feature is based on the intersection between the
set of senses related (via WordNet relations) to the
target sense and the set of senses related to members
of a seed set. First, for the target sense and each
member of the seed set, a set of related senses is
formed consisting of its synonyms, antonyms and di-
rect hypernyms as defined by WordNet. For a sense
s, R(s) is s together with its related senses.

compute an average percentage overlap as follows:

As above, R(s) is considered for each seed sense

stems in glosses (excluding stop words). The over-
laps considered are between the gloss of the tar-

seed set (for convenience, we will refer to these as
seedRelationSets).
A vector of stems is created, one for each stem
(excluding stop words) that appears in a gloss of
a member of seedRelationSets. If a stem in the
gloss of the target sense appears in this vector, then
the vector entry for that stem is the total count of
that stem in the glosses of the target sense and all
members of seedRelationSets.
A feature is created for each vector entry whose
value is the count at that position. Thus, these fea-
tures consider counts of individual stems, rather than
average proportions of overlaps, as for the previous
type of gloss feature.
Two vectors of features are used, one where the
seed set is the subjective seed set, and one where it
is the objective seed set.

We perform 10-fold cross validation experiments
on several data sets, using SVM light (Joachims,
1999)4 under its default settings.
Based on our random sampling of WordNet, it
appears that WordNet nouns are highly skewed to-
ward objective senses. (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2007)
argue that random sampling from WordNet would
yield a corpus mostly consisting of objective (neu-
tral) senses, which would be “pretty useless as a
benchmark for testing derived lexical resources for
opinion mining [p. 428].” So, they use a mixture of
subjective and objective senses in their data set.
To create a mixed corpus for our task, we anno-
tated a second random sample from WordNet (which
is as skewed as the previously mentioned one). We
added together all of the senses of words in the lexi-
con which we annotated, the leftover senses from the
selection of objective seed senses, and this new sam-
ple. We removed duplicates, multiple senses from
the same synset, and any senses belonging to the
same synset in either of the seed sets. This resulted
in a corpus of 2354 senses, 993 (42.18%) of which
are subjective and 1361 (57.82%) of which are ob-
jective.
The results with all of our features on this mixed
corpus are given in Row 1 of Table 1. In Table 1, the

7.1 Analysis and Discussion
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999125">
In this section, we seek to gain insights by perform-
ing ablation studies, evaluating our method on dif-
ferent data compositions, and comparing our results
to previous results.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999776">
7.2 Ablation Studies
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998484935483871">
Since there are several features, we divided them
into sets for the ablation studies. The vector-of-
gloss-words features are the most similar to ones
used in previous work. Thus, we opted to treat
them as one ablation group (Gloss vector). The
Overlaps group includes the RelOverlap(t, SS),
RelOverlap(t, OS), GlOverlap(t, SS), and
GlOverlap(t, OS) features. Finally, the LCS
group includes the SenseLCSscore and the
DomainLCSscore features.
There are two types of ablation studies. In the
first, one group of features at a time is included.
Those results are in the middle section of Table 1.
Thus, for example, the row labeled LCS in this sec-
tion is for an experiment using only the LCS fea-
tures. In comparison to performance when all fea-
tures are used, F-measure for the Overlaps and LCS
ablations is significantly different at the p &lt; .01
level, and, for the Gloss Vector ablation, it is sig-
nificantly different at the p = .052 level (one-tailed
t-test). Thus, all of the features together have better
performance than any single type of feature alone.
In the second type of ablation study, we use all
the features minus one group of features at a time.
The results are in the bottom section of Table 1.
Thus, for example, the row labeled LCS in this sec-
tion is for an experiment using all but the LCS fea-
tures. F-measures for LCS and Gloss vector are sig-
nificantly different at the p = .056 and p = .014 lev-
els, respectively. However, F-measure for the Over-
laps ablation is not significantly different (p = .39).

Several methods have been developed for identify-
ing subjective words. Perhaps an effective strategy
would be to begin with a word-level subjectivity lex-
icon, and then perform subjectivity sense labeling
to sort the subjective from objective senses of those
words. We also wondered about the relative effec-
tiveness of our method on strongsubj versus weak-
subj clues.
To answer these questions, we apply the full
model (again in 10-fold cross validation experi-
ments) to data sets composed of senses of polyse-
mous words in the subjectivity lexicon. To support
comparison, all of the data sets in this section have
a 50%-50% objective/subjective distribution.6 The
results are presented in Table 2.
For comparison, the first row repeats the results
for the mixed corpus from Table 1. The second
row shows results for a corpus of senses of a mix-
ture of strongsubj and weaksubj words. The corpus
was created by selecting a mixture of strongsubj and
weaksubj words, extracting their senses and the S/O
labels applied to them in Section 4, and then ran-
domly removing senses of the more frequent class
until the distribution is uniform. We see that the
results on this corpus are better than on the mixed
data set, even though the baseline accuracy is lower
and the corpus is smaller. This supports the idea
that an effective strategy would be to first identify
opinion-bearing words, and then apply our method
to those words to sort out their subjective and objec-
tive senses.

WM and SM address the same task as we do. To
compare our results to theirs, we apply our full
model (in 10-fold cross validation experiments) to
their data sets.7
Table 3 has the WM data set results. WM rank
their senses and present their results in the form of
precision recall curves. The second row of Table 3
shows their results at the recall level achieved by our
method (66%). Their precision at that level is sub-
stantially below ours.
Turning to ES, to create S/O annotations, we ap-
plied the following heuristic mapping (which is also
used by SM for the purpose of comparison): any
sense for which the sum of positive and negative
scores is greater than or equal to 0.5 is S, otherwise
it is O. We then evaluate the mapped tags against the
gold standard of WM. The results are in Row 3 of
Table 3. Note that this mapping is not fair to Sen-
tiWordNet, as the tasks are quite different, and we
do not believe any conclusions can be drawn. We
include the results to eliminate the possibility that
their method is as good ours on our task, despite the
differences between the tasks.

8 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999973607142857">
In this paper, we introduced an integrative approach
to automatic subjectivity word sense labeling which
combines features exploiting the hierarchical struc-
ture and domain information of WordNet, as well
as similarity of glosses and overlap among sets
of semantically related words. There are several
contributions. First, we learn several things. We
found (in Section 4) that even reliable lists of sub-
jective (opinion-bearing) words have many objec-
tive senses. We asked if word- and sense-level ap-
proaches could be used effectively in tandem, and
found (in Section 7.3) that an effective strategy is to
first identify opinion-bearing words, and then apply
our method to sort out their subjective and objective
senses. We also found (in Section 7.2) that the entire
set of features gives better results than any individ-
ual type of feature alone.
Second, several of the features are novel for
our task, including those exploiting the hierarchical
structure of a lexical resource, domain information,
and relations to seed sets expanded with monose-
mous senses.
Finally, the combination of our particular features
is effective. For example, on senses of words from
a subjectivity lexicon, accuracies range from 20 to
29 percentage points above baseline. Further, our
combination of features outperforms previous ap-
proaches.

One reason is that different features may be relevant for the two subproblems. For example, negation features are more important for polarity classification than for subjectivity classification. Note that some of our features require vertical links that are present in WordNet for nouns and verbs but not for other parts of speech. Thus we address nouns (leaving verbs to future work). There are other motivations for focusing on nouns. Relatively little work in subjectivity and sentiment analysis has focused on subjective nouns. Also, a study (Bruce and Wiebe, 1999) showed that, of the major parts of speech, nouns are the most ambiguous with respect to the subjectivity of their instances. Turning to word senses, we adopt the definitions from WM. First, subjective: “Classifying a sense as S means that, when the sense is used in a text or conversation, we expect it to express subjectivity; we also expect the phrase or sentence containing it to be subjective [WM, pp. 2-3].” In WM, it is noted that sentences containing objective senses may not be objective, as in the sentence Will someone shut that darn alarm off? Thus, objective senses are defined as follow</context>

There is no unambiguous mapping between the labels of WM/SM and ES, first because WM/SM use distinct classes and ES use numerical ratings, and second because WM/SM distinguish between objective senses on the one hand and neutral subjective senses on the other, while those are both neutral in the scheme used by ES.

The other three groups start with positive and negative seed sets and expand them by adding synonyms and antonyms, and traversing horizontal links in WordNet. AB, ES, and SMsup additionally use information contained in glosses; AB also use hyponyms; SMsup also uses relation and POS features. AB perform multiple runs of their system to assign fuzzy categories to senses. ES use a semi-supervised, multiple-classifier learning approach. In a later paper, (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2007), ES again use information in glosses, applying a random walk ranking algorithm to a graph in which synsets are linked if a member of the first synset appears in the gloss of the second. Like ES and SMsup, we use machine learning, but with more diverse sources of knowledge. Further, several of our features are novel for the task. The LCS features (Section 6.1) detect subjectivity by measuring the similarity of a candidate word sense with a seed set. WM also use a similarity measure, but as a way to filter the output of a measure of distributional similarity (selecting words for a given word se</context>

Two features are included in the experiments below, one for each of the subjective and objective seed sets. 6.4 Gloss-based features These features are Lesk-style features (Lesk, 1986) that exploit overlaps between glosses of target and seed senses.

Going up one more level, the hypernym of criticism is the “expression of disapproval” meaning of disapproval, which has several additional negative subjective descendants, such as the “expression of opposition and disapproval” sense of discouragement. Our hypothesis is that the cases where subjectivity is preserved in the hypernym structure, or where hypernyms do lead from subjective senses to others, are the ones that have the highest least common subsumer score with the seed set of known subjective senses. We calculate similarity using the informationcontent based measure proposed in (Resnik, 1995), as implemented in the WordNet::Similarity package (using the default option in which LCS values are computed over the SemCor corpus).3 Given a 3http://search.cpan.org/dist/WordNet-Similarity/ 13 taxonomy such as WordNet, the information content associated with a concept is determined as the likelihood of encountering that concept, defined as −log(p(C)), where p(C) is the probability of seeing concept C in a corpus. The similarity between two concepts is then defined in terms of information content as: LCSs(C1, C2) = max[−log(p(C))], where C is the concept that subsumes both C1 and C2 and has</context>

We give evidence suggesting that first identifying subjective words and then disambiguating their senses would be an effective approach to subjectivity sense labeling. 10 Human Language Technologies: The 2009 Annual Conference of the North American Chapter of the ACL, pages 10–18, Boulder, Colorado, June 2009. c�2009 Association for Computational Linguistics There are several motivations for assigning subjectivity labels to senses. First, (Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006) provide evidence that word sense labels, together with contextual subjectivity analysis, can be exploited to improve performance in word sense disambiguation. Similarly, given subjectivity sense labels, word-sense disambiguation may potentially help contextual subjectivity analysis. In addition, as lexical resources such as WordNet are developed further, subjectivity labels would provide principled criteria for refining word senses, as well as for clustering similar meanings to create more coursegrained sense inventories. For many opinion mining applications, polarity (positive, negative) is </context>

Another novel aspect of our similarity features is that they are particularized to domain, which greatly reduces calculation. The domain subjectivity LCS features (Section 6.2) are also novel for our task. So is augmenting seed sets with monosemous words, for greater coverage without requiring human intervention or sacrificing quality. Note that none of our features as we specifically define them has been used in previous work; combining them together, our approach outperforms previous approaches. 12 4 Lexicon and Annotations We use the subjectivity lexicon of (Wiebe and Riloff, 2005)1 both to create a subjective seed set and to create the experimental data sets. The lexicon is a list of words and phrases that have subjective uses, though only word entries are used in this paper (i.e., we do not address phrases at this point). Some entries are from manually developed resources, including the General Inquirer, while others were derived from corpora using automatic methods. Through manual review and empirical testing on data, (Wiebe and Riloff, 2005) divided the clues into strong (strongsubj) and weak (weaksubj) subjectivity clues. Strongsubj clues have subjective meanings w</context>

UCC/Disciples leaders roundly condemned the Iranian President’s verbal assault on Israel. What’s the catch? Polarity (also called semantic orientation) is also important to NLP applications in sentiment analysis and opinion extraction. In review mining, for example, we want to know whether an opinion about a product is positive or negative. Even so, we believe there are strong motivations for a separate subjective/objective (S/O) classification as well. First, expressions may be subjective but not have any particular polarity. An example given by (Wilson et al., 2005) is Jerome says the hospital feels no different than a hospital in the states. An NLP application system may want to find a wide range of private states attributed to a person, such as their motivations, thoughts, and speculations, in addition to their positive and negative sentiments. Second, distinguishing S and O instances has often proven more difficult than subsequent polarity classification. Researchers have found this at various levels of analysis, including the manual annotation of phrases (Takamura et al., 2006), sentiment classification of phrases (Wilson et al., 2005), sentiment tag</context>

Researchers have found this at various levels of analysis, including the manual annotation of phrases (Takamura et al., 2006), sentiment classification of phrases (Wilson et al., 2005), sentiment tagging of words (Andreevskaia and Bergler, 2006b), and sentiment tagging of word senses (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006a). Thus, effective methods for S/O classification promise to improve performance for sentiment classification. In fact, researchers in sentiment analysis have realized benefits by decomposing the problem into S/O and polarity classification (Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003; Pang and Lee, 2004; Wilson et al., 2005; Kim and Hovy, 2006). One reason is that different features may be relevant for the two subproblems. For example, negation features are more important for polarity classification than for subjectivity classification. Note that some of our features require vertical links that are present in WordNet for nouns and verbs but not for other parts of speech. Thus we address nouns (leaving verbs to future work). There are other motivations for focusing on nouns. Relatively little work in subjectivity and sentiment analysis has focused on subjective nouns. Also</context>
