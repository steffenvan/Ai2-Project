Recently, biomedical researchers have been fac-
ing the vast repository of research papers, e.g.
MEDLINE. These researchers are eager to search
biomedical correlations such as protein-protein or
gene-disease associations. The use of natural lan-
guage processing technology is expected to re-
duce their burden, and various attempts of infor-
mation extraction using NLP has been being made
(Blaschke and Valencia, 2002; Hao et al., 2005;
Chun et al., 2006). However, the framework of
traditional information retrieval (IR) has difficulty
with the accurate retrieval of such relational con-
cepts. This is because relational concepts are
essentially determined by semantic relations of
words, and keyword-based IR techniques are in-
sufficient to describe such relations precisely.
This paper proposes a practical HPSG parser
for English, Enju, an intelligent search engine for
the accurate retrieval of relational concepts from

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99959747826087">
We developed an English HPSG parser, Enju 1
(Miyao and Tsujii, 2005; Hara et al., 2005; Ni-
nomiya et al., 2005). Table 1 shows the perfor-
mance. The F-score in the table was accuracy
of the predicate-argument relations output by the
parser. A predicate-argument relation is defined
as a tuple (Q, wh, a, wa), where a is the predi-
cate type (e.g., adjective, intransitive verb), wh
is the head word of the predicate, a is the argu-
ment label (MOD, ARG1, ..., ARG4), and wa is
the head word of the argument. Precision/recall
is the ratio of tuples correctly identified by the
parser. The lexicon of the grammar was extracted
from Sections 02-21 of Penn Treebank (39,832
sentences). In the table, ‘HPSG-PTB’ means that
the statistical model was trained on Penn Tree-
bank. ‘HPSG-GENIA’ means that the statistical
model was trained on both Penn Treebank and GE-
NIA treebank as described in (Hara et al., 2005).
The GENIA treebank (Tateisi et al., 2005) consists
of 500 abstracts (4,446 sentences) extracted from
MEDLINE.

Figure 2 shows the top page of the MEDIE. ME-
DIE is an intelligent search engine for the accu-
rate retrieval of relational concepts from MED-
LINE 2 (Miyao et al., 2006). Prior to retrieval, all
sentences are annotated with predicate argument
structures and ontological identifiers by applying
Enju and a term recognizer.

3.1 Automatically Annotated Corpus

<bodyText confidence="0.999953461538462">
First, we applied a POS analyzer and then Enju.
The POS analyzer and HPSG parser are trained
by using the GENIA corpus (Tsuruoka et al.,
2005; Hara et al., 2005), which comprises around
2,000 MEDLINE abstracts annotated with POS
and Penn Treebank style syntactic parse trees
(Tateisi et al., 2005). The HPSG parser generates
parse trees in a stand-off format that can be con-
verted to XML by combining it with the original
text.
We also annotated technical terms of genes and
diseases in our developed corpus. Technical terms
are annotated simply by exact matching of dictio-

nary entries and the terms separated by space, tab,
period, comma, hat, colon, semi-colon, brackets,
square brackets and slash in MEDLINE.
The entire dictionary was generated by apply-
ing the automatic generation method of name vari-
ations (Tsuruoka and Tsujii, 2004) to the GENA
dictionary for the gene names (Koike and Takagi,
2004) and the UMLS (Unified Medical Language
System) meta-thesaurus for the disease names
(Lindberg et al., 1993). It was generated by ap-
plying the name-variation generation method, and
we obtained 4,467,855 entries of a gene and dis-
ease dictionary.

3.2 Functions of MEDIE
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999995172413793">
MEDIE provides three types of search, seman-
tic search, keyword search, GCL search. GCL
search provides us the most fundamental and pow-
erful functions in which users can specify the
boolean relations, linear order relation and struc-
tural relations with variables. Trained users can
enjoy all functions in MEDIE by the GCL search,
but it is not easy for general users to write ap-
propriate queries for the parsed corpus. The se-
mantic search enables us to specify an event verb
with its subject and object easily. MEDIE auto-
matically generates the GCL query from the se-
mantic query, and runs the GCL search. Figure 3
shows the output of semantic search for the query
‘What disease does dystrophin cause?’. This ex-
ample will give us the most intuitive understand-
ings of the proximal and structural retrieval with a
richly annotated parsed corpus. MEDIE retrieves
sentences which include event verbs of ‘cause’
and noun ‘dystrophin’ such that ‘dystrophin’ is the
subject of the event verbs. The event verb and its
subject and object are highlighted with designated
colors. As seen in the figure, small sentences in
relative clauses, passive forms or coordination are
retrieved. As the objects of the event verbs are
highlighted, we can easily see what disease dys-
trophin caused. As the target corpus is already
annotated with diseases entities, MEDIE can ef-
ficiently retrieve the disease expressions.

Info-PubMed provides information from MED-
LINE on protein-protein interactions. Given the
name of a gene or protein, it shows a list of the
names of other genes/proteins which co-occur in
sentences from MEDLINE, along with the fre-
quency of co-occurrence.
Co-occurrence of two proteins/genes in the
same sentence does not always imply that they in-
teract. For more accurate extraction of sentences
that indicate interactions, it is necessary to iden-
tify relations between the two substances. We
adopted PASs derived by Enju and constructed ex-
traction patterns on specific verbs and their argu-
ments based on the derived PASs (Yakusiji, 2006).

of genes/proteins which co-occur in the same
sentences, along with co-occurrence frequency.
The GeneBox in the leftmost column is the one
you have moved to ‘Interaction Viewer.’ The
GeneBoxes in the second column correspond to
gene/proteins which co-occur in the same sen-
tences, followed by the boxes in the third column,
InteractionBoxes.
Drag an InteractionBox to ‘ContentViewer’ to
see the content of the box (Figure 6). An In-
teractionBox is a set of SentenceBoxes. A Sen-
tenceBox corresponds to a sentence in MEDLINE
in which the two gene/proteins co-occur. A Sen-
tenceBox indicates whether the co-occurrence in
the sentence is direct evidence of interaction or
not. If it is judged as direct evidence of interac-
tion, it is indicated as Interaction. Otherwise, it is
indicated as Co-occurrence.

MEDIE is an intelligent search engine for the accurate retrieval of relational concepts from MEDLINE 2 (Miyao et al., 2006). Prior to retrieval, all sentences are annotated with predicate argument structures and ontological identifiers by applying Enju and a term recognizer. 3.1 Automatically Annotated Corpus First, we applied a POS analyzer and then Enju. The POS analyzer and HPSG parser are trained by using the GENIA corpus (Tsuruoka et al., 2005; Hara et al., 2005), which comprises around 2,000 MEDLINE abstracts annotated with POS and Penn Treebank style syntactic parse trees (Tateisi et al., 2005). The HPSG parser generates parse trees in a stand-off format that can be converted to XML by combining it with the original text. We also annotated technical terms of genes and diseases in our developed corpus. Technical terms are annotated simply by exact matching of dictio2http://www-tsujii.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/medie/ nary entries and the terms separated by space, tab, period, comma, hat, colon, semi-colon, brackets, square brackets and slash in MEDLINE.

Table 1 shows the performance. The F-score in the table was accuracy of the predicate-argument relations output by the parser. A predicate-argument relation is defined as a tuple (Q, wh, a, wa), where a is the predicate type (e.g., adjective, intransitive verb), wh is the head word of the predicate, a is the argument label (MOD, ARG1, ..., ARG4), and wa is the head word of the argument.
