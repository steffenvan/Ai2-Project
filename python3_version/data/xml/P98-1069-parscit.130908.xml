1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999947484375">
In recent years, there is a phenomenal growth
in the amount of online text material available
from the greatest information repository known
as the World Wide Web. Various traditional
information retrieval(IR) techniques combined
with natural language processing(NLP) tech-
niques have been re-targeted to enable efficient
access of the WWW—search engines, indexing,
relevance feedback, query term and keyword
weighting, document analysis, document clas-
sification, etc. Most of these techniques aim at
efficient online search for information already on
the Web.
Meanwhile, the corpus linguistic community
regards the WWW as a vast potential of cor-
pus resources. It is now possible to download
a large amount of texts with automatic tools
when one needs to compute, for example, a
list of synonyms; or download domain-specific
monolingual texts by specifying a keyword to
the search engine, and then use this text to ex-
tract domain-specific terms. It remains to be
seen how we can also make use of the multilin-
gual texts as NLP resources.
In the years since the appearance of the first
papers on using statistical models for bilin-
gual lexicon compilation and machine transla-
tion(Brown et al., 1993; Brown et al., 1991;
Gale and Church, 1993; Church, 1993; Simard
et al., 1992), large amount of human effort and
time has been invested in collecting parallel cor-
pora of translated texts. Our goal is to alleviate
this effort and enlarge the scope of corpus re-
sources by looking into monolingual, compara-
ble texts. This type of texts are known as non-
parallel corpora. Such nonparallel, monolingual
texts should be much more prevalent than par-
allel texts. However, previous attempts at using
nonparallel corpora for terminology translation
were constrained by the inadequate availability
of same-domain, comparable texts in electronic
form. The type of nonparallel texts obtained
from the LDC or university libraries were of-
ten restricted, and were usually out-of-date as
soon as they became available. For new word
translation, the timeliness of corpus resources
is a prerequisite, so is the continuous and au-
tomatic availability of nonparallel, comparable
texts in electronic form. Data collection ef-
fort should not inhibit the actual translation
effort. Fortunately, nowadays the World Wide
Web provides us with a daily increase of fresh,
up-to-date multilingual material, together with
the archived versions, all easily downloadable by
software tools running in the background. It is
possible to specify the URL of the online site of
a newspaper, and the start and end dates, and
automatically download all the daily newspaper
materials between those dates.
In this paper, we describe a new method
which combines IR and NLP techniques to ex-
tract new word translation from automatically
downloaded English-Chinese nonparallel news-
paper texts.

To improve the performance of a machine trans-
lation system, it is often necessary to update
its bilingual lexicon, either by human lexicog-
raphers or statistical methods using large cor-
pora. Up until recently, statistical bilingual lex-
icon compilation relies largely on parallel cor-
pora. This is an undesirable constraint at times.
In using a broad-coverage English-Chinese MT
system to translate some text recently, we dis-
covered that it is unable to translate Mel! li-
ougan which occurs very frequently in the text.
Other words which the system cannot find in
its 20,000-entry lexicon include proper names

such as the Taiwanese president Lee Teng-Hui,
and the Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung Chee-
Hwa. To our disappointment, we cannot lo-
cate any parallel texts which include such words
since they only start to appear frequently in re-
cent months.
A quick search on the Web turned up archives
of multiple local newspapers in English and Chi-
nese. Our challenge is to find the translation of
1.,133 I liougan and other words from this online
nonparallel, comparable corpus of newspaper
materials. We choose to use issues of the En-
glish newspaper Hong Kong Standard and the
Chinese newspaper Mingpao, from Dec.12,97 to
Dec.31,97, as our corpus. The English text con-
tains about 3 Mb of text whereas the Chinese
text contains 8.8 Mb of 2 byte character texts.
So both texts are comparable in size. Since they
are both local mainstream newspapers, it is rea-
sonable to assume that their contents are com-
parable as well.

Unlike in parallel texts, the position of a word
in a text does not give us information about its
translation in the other language. (Rapp, 1995;
Fung and McKeown, 1997) suggest that a con-
tent word is closely associated with some words
in its context. As a tutorial example, we postu-
late that the words which appear in the context
ofMet, Iliougan should be similar to the words
appearing in the context of its English trans-
lation, flu. We can form a vector space model
of a word in terms of its context word indices,
similar to the vector space model of a text in
terms of its constituent word indices (Salton and
Buckley, 1988; Salton and Yang, 1973; Croft,
1984; Turtle and Croft, 1992; Bookstein, 1983;
Korfhage, 1995; Jones, 1979).
The value of the i-th dimension of a word
vector W is f if the i-th word in the lexicon
appears f times in the same sentences as W.
Left columns in Table 1 and Table 2 show
the list of content words which appear most fre-
quently in the context of flu and Africa respec-
tively. The right column shows those which oc-
cur most frequently in the context of bv,g. We
can see that the context of At is more similar
to that of flu than to that of Africa.

4 Bilingual lexicon as seed words
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999862470588235">
So the first clue to the similarity between a word
and its translation number of common words in
their contexts. In a bilingual corpus, the &amp;quot;com-
mon word&amp;quot; is actually a bilingual word pair. We
use the lexicon of the MT system to &amp;quot;bridge&amp;quot; all
bilingual word pairs in the corpora. These word
pairs are used as seed words.
We found that the contexts of flu and &apos;MI
Iliougan share 233 &amp;quot;common&amp;quot; context words,
whereas the contexts of Africa and W„Iff Iliougan
share only 121 common words, even though the
context of flu has 491 unique words and the con-
text of Africa has 328 words.
In the vector space model, W[flu] and
W[liougan] has 233 overlapping dimensions,
whereas there are 121 overlapping dimensions
between W[flu] and W [Africa].

<bodyText confidence="0.999707125">
The flu example illustrates that the actual rank-
ing of the context word frequencies provides a
second clue to the similarity between a bilingual
word pair. For example, virus ranks very high
for both flu and ME Iliougan and is a strong
&amp;quot;bridge&amp;quot; between this bilingual word pair. This
leads us to use the term frequency(TF) mea-
sure. The TF of a context word is defined as
the frequency of the word in the context of W.
(e.g. TF of virus in flu is 26, in MM. is 147).
However, the TF of a word is not indepen-
dent of its general usage frequency. In an ex-
treme case, the function word the appears most
frequently in English texts and would have the
highest TF in the context of any W. In our HK-
Standard/Mingpao corpus, Hong Kong is the
most frequent content word which appears ev-
erywhere. So in the flu example, we would like
to reduce the significance of Hong Kong&apos;s TF
while keeping that of virus. A common way to
account for this difference is by using the inverse
document frequency(IDF). Among the variants
of IDF, we choose the following representation
from (Jones, 1979):

6 Ranking translation candidates
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999418">
Next, a ranking algorithm is needed to match
the unknown word vectors to their counterparts
in the other language. A ranking algorithm se-
lects the best target language candidate for a
source language word according to direct com-
parison of some similarity measures (Frakes and
Baeza-Yates, 1992).
We modify the similarity measure proposed
by (Salton and Buckley, 1988) into the following
SO:

<equation confidence="0.783138">
IDF =

of word i in the corpus
SO(We, We) =

The IDF of virus is 1.81 and that of Hong
Kong is 1.23 in the English text. The IDF of
WS is 1.92 and that of Hong Kong is 0.83 in
Chinese. So in both cases, virus is a stronger
&amp;quot;bridge&amp;quot; for biglliougan than Hong Kong.
Hence, for every context seed word i, we as-
sign a word weighting factor (Salton and
Buckley, 1988) w = TFiw x IDFi where TFiw
is the TF of word i in the context of word W.
The updated vector space model of word W has
wi in its i-th dimension.
The ranking of the 20 words in the contexts
of W,,,f3 Iliougan is rearranged by this weighting
factor as shown in Table3.
Variants of similarity measures such as the
above have been used extensively in the IR com-
munity (Frakes and Baeza-Yates, 1992). They
are mostly based on the Cosine Measure of two
vectors. For different tasks, the weighting fac-
tor might vary. For example, if we add the IDF
into the weighting factor, we get the following
measure Si:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.879230666666667">
Sl(We, We) =iEi(iwc2 x =l

</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.995345">

<bodyText confidence="0.9998742">
In addition, the Dice and Jaccard coefficients
are also suitable similarity measures for doc-
ument comparison (Frakes and Baeza-Yates,
1992). We also implement the Dice coefficient
into similarity measure S2:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.6514095">

ELiwic2 ELiwie2
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.659281">

<bodyText confidence="0.999722428571429">
Si is often used in comparing a short query
with a document text, whereas S2 is used in
comparing two document texts. Reasoning that
our objective falls somewhere in between—we
are comparing segments of a document, we also
multiply the above two measures into a third
similarity measure S3.

7 Confidence on seed word pairs
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999978352941177">
In using bilingual seed words such asN,Et /virus
as &amp;quot;bridges&amp;quot; for terminology translation, the
quality of the bilingual seed lexicon naturally
affects the system output. In the case of Eu-
ropean language pairs such as French-English,
we can envision using words sharing common
cognates as these &amp;quot;bridges&amp;quot;. Most importantly,
we can assume that the word boundaries are
similar in French and English. However, the
situation is messier with English and Chinese.
First, segmentation of the Chinese text into
words already introduces some ambiguity of the
seed word identities. Secondly, English-Chinese
translations are complicated by the fact that
the two languages share very little stemming
properties, or part-of-speech set, or word order.
This property causes every English word to have
many Chinese translations and vice versa. In a
source-target language translation scenario, the
translated text can be &amp;quot;rearranged&amp;quot; and cleaned
up by a monolingual language model in the tar-
get language. However, the lexicon is not very
reliable in establishing &amp;quot;bridges&amp;quot; between non-
parallel English-Chinese texts. To compensate
for this ambiguity in the seed lexicon, we intro-
duce a confidence weighting to each bilingual
word pair used as seed words. If a word ie is the
k—th candidate for word ic, then wite wite /ki.
The similarity scores then become S4 and S5
and S6 = S4 x S5:
We also experiment with other combinations
of the similarity scores such as S7 = SO x S5.
All similarity measures S3 — S7 are used in the
experiment for finding a translation for ME •

In order to apply the above algorithm to find the
translation for blgt, I liougan from the HKStan-
dard/Mingpao corpus, we first use a script to
select the 118 English content words which are
not in the lexicon as possible candidates. Using
similarity measures S3— S7, the highest ranking
candidates of MS are shown in Table 6. S6 and
S7 appear to be the best similarity measures.
We then test the algorithm with S7 on more
Chinese words which are not found in the lex-
icon but which occur frequently enough in the
Mingpao texts. A statistical new word extrac-
tion tool can be used to find these words. The
unknown Chinese words and their English coun-
terparts, as well as the occurrence frequencies of
these words in HKStandard/Mingpao are shown
in Table 4. Frequency numbers with a * in-
dicates that this word does not occur frequent
enough to be found. Chinese words with a *
indicates that it is a word with segmentation
and translation ambiguities. For example, 44:
(Lam) could be a family name, or part of an-
other word meaning forest. When it is used as
a family name, it could be transliterated into
Lam in Cantonese or Lin in Mandarin.
Disregarding all entries with a * in the above
table, we apply the algorithm to the rest of the
Chinese unknown words and the 118 English un-
known words from HKStandard. The output is
ranked by the similarity scores. The highest
ranking translated pairs are shown in Table 5.
The only Chinese unknown words which are
not correctly translated in the above list are ik6

early statistical terminology translation meth-

exploring nonparallel corpora for terminology
translation are very few (Rapp, 1995; Fung,
1995a; Fung and McKeown, 1997). Among
these, (Rapp, 1995) proposes that the associ-
ation between a word and its close collocate
is preserved in any language. and (Fung and

between a word and many seed words are also

<bodyText confidence="0.99994925">
We have devised an algorithm using context
seed word TF/IDF for extracting bilingual
lexicon from nonparallel, comparable cor-
pus in English-Chinese. This algorithm takes
into account the reliability of bilingual seed
words and is language independent. This al-
gorithm can be applied to other language pairs
such as English-French or English-German. In
these cases, since the languages are more sim-
ilar linguistically and the seed word lexicon is
more reliable, the algorithm should yield bet-
ter results. This algorithm can also be applied
in an iterative fashion where high-ranking bilin-
gual word pairs can be added to the seed word
list, which in turn can yield more new bilingual
word pairs.

(Rapp, 1995; Fung and McKeown, 1997) suggest that a content word is closely associated with some words in its context. As a tutorial example, we postulate that the words which appear in the context ofMet, Iliougan should be similar to the words appearing in the context of its English translation, flu. We can form a vector space model of a word in terms of its context word indices, similar to the vector space model of a text in terms of its constituent word indices (Salton and Buckley, 1988; Salton and Yang, 1973; Croft, 1984; Turtle and Croft, 1992; Bookstein, 1983; Korfhage, 1995; Jones, 1979). The value of the i-th dimension of a word vector W is f if the i-th word in the lexicon appears f times in the same sentences as W. Left columns in Table 1 and Table 2 show the list of content words which appear most frequently in the context of flu and Africa respectively.

It is now possible to download a large amount of texts with automatic tools when one needs to compute, for example, a list of synonyms; or download domain-specific monolingual texts by specifying a keyword to the search engine, and then use this text to extract domain-specific terms. It remains to be seen how we can also make use of the multilingual texts as NLP resources. In the years since the appearance of the first papers on using statistical models for bilingual lexicon compilation and machine translation(Brown et al., 1993; Brown et al., 1991; Gale and Church, 1993; Church, 1993; Simard et al., 1992), large amount of human effort and time has been invested in collecting parallel corpora of translated texts. Our goal is to alleviate this effort and enlarge the scope of corpus resources by looking into monolingual, comparable texts. This type of texts are known as nonparallel corpora. Such nonparallel, monolingual texts should be much more prevalent than parallel texts. However, previous attempts at using nonparallel corpora for terminology translation were constrained by the inadequate availability of same-domain, comparable texts in electronic form. The</context>

In an extreme case, the function word the appears most frequently in English texts and would have the highest TF in the context of any W. In our HKStandard/Mingpao corpus, Hong Kong is the most frequent content word which appears everywhere. So in the flu example, we would like to reduce the significance of Hong Kong&apos;s TF while keeping that of virus. A common way to account for this difference is by using the inverse document frequency(IDF).

A ranking algorithm selects the best target language candidate for a source language word according to direct comparison of some similarity measures (Frakes and Baeza-Yates, 1992). We modify the similarity measure proposed by (Salton and Buckley, 1988) into the following SO: IDF = where maxn = log +1 og ni the maximum frequency of any word in the corpus the total number of occurrences of word i in the corpus SO(We, We) = where wic = wie = (wieX wie) VELiwic2 x ELiwie2 TFic TFie The IDF of virus is 1.81 and that of Hong Kong is 1.23 in the English text. The IDF of WS is 1.92 and that of Hong Kong is 0.83 in Chinese. So in both cases, virus is a stronger &amp;quot;bridge&amp;quot; for biglliougan than Hong Kong. Hence, for every context seed word i, we assign a word weighting factor (Salton and Buckley, 1988) w = TFiw x IDFi where TFiw is the TF of word i in t</context>

It is now possible to download a large amount of texts with automatic tools when one needs to compute, for example, a list of synonyms; or download domain-specific monolingual texts by specifying a keyword to the search engine, and then use this text to extract domain-specific terms. It remains to be seen how we can also make use of the multilingual texts as NLP resources. In the years since the appearance of the first papers on using statistical models for bilingual lexicon compilation and machine translation(Brown et al., 1993; Brown et al., 1991; Gale and Church, 1993; Church, 1993; Simard et al., 1992), large amount of human effort and time has been invested in collecting parallel corpora of translated texts. Our goal is to alleviate this effort and enlarge the scope of corpus resources by looking into monolingual, comparable texts. This type of texts are known as nonparallel corpora. Such nonparallel, monolingual texts should be much more prevalent than parallel texts. However, previous attempts at using nonparallel corpora for terminology translation were constrained by the inadequate availability of same-domain, comparable texts in electronic form.

In fact, almost all unambiguous Chinese new words find their translations in the first 100 of the ranked list. Six of the Chinese words have correct translation as their first candidate. 9 Related work Using vector space model and similarity measures for ranking is a common approach in IR for query/text and text/text comparisons (Salton and Buckley, 1988; Salton and Yang, 1973; Croft, 1984; Turtle and Croft, 1992; Bookstein, 1983; Korfhage, 1995; Jones, 1979). This approach has also been used by (Dagan and Itai, 1994; Gale et al., 1992; Shfitze, 1992; Gale et al., 1993; Yarowsky, 1995; Gale and Church, 1 Lunar is not an unknown word in English, Yeltsin finds its translation in the 4-th candidate.
