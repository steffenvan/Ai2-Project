<bodyText confidence="0.999932083333333">
NTCIR, often referred to as the Asian TREC, is
eleven years old now. From NTCIR-1 (1999) to
NTCIR-6 (2007), I was a task participant. From
NTCIR-7 (2008), I started to serve as an organ-
iser. From NTCIR-9 (2011), I will be serving as
an NTCIR evaluation co-chair. In this talk, I will
first look back on the past NTCIR rounds with
a focus on crosslingual and multilingual tasks,
e.g. Advanced Crosslingual Information Access
(ACLIA). Then I will briefly discuss future plans
for NTCIR which is currently going through dras-
tic structural changes.
