In this work, we propose two extensions of
standard word lexicons in statistical ma-
chine translation: A discriminative word
lexicon that uses sentence-level source in-
formation to predict the target words and
a trigger-based lexicon model that extends
IBM model 1 with a second trigger, allow-
ing for a more fine-grained lexical choice
of target words. The models capture de-
pendencies that go beyond the scope of
conventional SMT models such as phrase-
and language models. We show that the
models improve translation quality by 1%

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999968163636364">
Lexical dependencies modeled in standard phrase-
based SMT are rather local. Even though the deci-
sion about the best translation is made on sentence
level, phrase models and word lexicons usually do
not take context beyond the phrase boundaries into
account. This is especially problematic since the
average source phrase length used during decod-
ing is small. When translating Chinese to English,
e.g., it is typically close to only two words.
The target language model is the only model
that uses lexical context across phrase boundaries.
It is a very important feature in the log-linear setup
of today’s phrase-based decoders. However, its
context is typically limited to three to six words
and it is not informed about the source sentence.
In the presented models, we explicitly take advan-
tage of sentence-level dependencies including the
source side and make non-local predictions for the
target words. This is an important aspect when
translating from languages like German and Chi-
nese where long-distance dependencies are com-
mon. In Chinese, for example, tenses are often en-
coded by indicator words and particles whose po-
sition is relatively free in the sentence. In German,
prefixes of verbs can be moved over long distances
towards the end of the sentence.
In this work, we propose two models that can
be categorized as extensions of standard word lex-
icons: A discriminative word lexicon that uses
global, i.e. sentence-level source information to
predict the target words using a statistical classi-
fier and a trigger-based lexicon model that extends
the well-known IBM model 1 (Brown et al., 1993)
with a second trigger, allowing for a more fine-
grained lexical choice of target words. The log-
linear framework of the discriminative word lexi-
con offers a high degree of flexibility in the selec-
tion of features. Other sources of information such
as syntax or morphology can be easily integrated.
The trigger-based lexicon model, or simply
triplet model since it is based on word triplets,
is not trained discriminatively but uses the classi-
cal maximum likelihood approach (MLE) instead.
We train the triplets iteratively on a training cor-
pus using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) al-
gorithm. We will present how both models al-
low for a representation of topic-related sentence-
level information which puts them close to word
sense disambiguation (WSD) approaches. As will
be shown later, the experiments indicate that these
models help to ensure translation of content words
that are often omitted by the baseline system. This
is a common problem in Chinese-English transla-
tion. Furthermore, the models are often capable to
produce a better lexical choice of content words.

Several word lexicon models have emerged in the
context of multilingual natural language process-
ing. Some of them were used as a machine transla-
tion system or as a part of one such system. There
are three major types of models: Heuristic models
as in (Melamed, 2000), generative models as the
IBM models (Brown et al., 1993) and discrimina-
tive models (Varea et al., 2001; Bangalore et al.,
2006).
Similar to this work, the authors of (Varea et
al., 2001) try to incorporate a maximum entropy
lexicon model into an SMT system. They use
the words and word classes from the local con-
text as features and show improvements with n-
best rescoring.
The models in this paper are also related to
word sense disambiguation (WSD). For example,
(Chan et al., 2007) trained a discriminative model
for WSD using local but also across-sentence un-
igram collocations of words in order to refine
phrase pair selection dynamically by incorporat-
ing scores from the WSD classifier. They showed
improvements in translation quality in a hierar-
chical phrase-based translation system. Another
WSD approach incorporating context-dependent
phrasal translation lexicons is given in (Carpuat
and Wu, 2007) and has been evaluated on sev-
eral translation tasks. Our model differs from the
latter in three ways. First, our approach mod-
els word selection of the target sentence based on
global sentence-level features of the source sen-
tence. Second, instead of disambiguating phrase
senses as in (Carpuat and Wu, 2007), we model
word selection independently of the phrases used
in the MT models. Finally, the training is done in a
different way as will be presented in Sections 3.1.1
and 3.2.1.
Recently, full translation models using discrim-
inative training criteria emerged as well. They
are designed to generate a translation for a given
source sentence and not only score or disam-
biguate hypotheses given by a translation system.
In (Ittycheriah and Roukos, 2007), the model can
predict 1-to-many translations with gaps and uses
words, morphologic and syntactic features from
the local context.
The authors of (Venkatapathy and Bangalore,
2007) propose three different models. The first
one is a global lexical selection model which in-
cludes all words of the source sentence as features,
regardless of their position. Using these features,
the system predicts the words that should be in-
cluded in the target sentence. Sentence structure is
then reconstructed using permutations of the gen-
erated bag of target words. We will also use this
type of features in our model.
One of the simplest models in the context of
lexical triggers is the IBM model 1 (Brown et
al., 1993) which captures lexical dependencies be-
tween source and target words. It can be seen
as a lexicon containing correspondents of transla-
tions of source and target words in a very broad
sense since the pairs are trained on the full sen-
tence level. The trigger-based lexicon model used
in this work follows the training procedure intro-
duced in (Hasan et al., 2008) and is integrated di-
rectly in the decoder instead of being applied in
n-best list reranking. The model is very close to
the IBM model 1 and can be seen as an extension
of it by taking another word into the condition-
ing part, i.e. the triggering items. Thus, instead
of p(f|e), it models p(f|e, e&apos;). Furthermore, since
the second trigger can come from any part of the
sentence, there is a link to long-range monolin-
gual triggers as presented in (Tillmann and Ney,
1997) where a trigger language model was trained
using the EM algorithm and helped to reduce per-
plexities and word error rates in a speech recog-
nition experiment. In (Rosenfeld, 1996), another
approach was chosen to model monolingual trig-
gers using a maximum-entropy based framework.
Again, this adapted LM could improve speech
recognition performance significantly.
A comparison of a variant of the trigger-based
lexicon model applied in decoding and n-best list
reranking can be found in (Hasan and Ney, 2009).
In order to reduce the number of overall triplets,
the authors use the word alignments for fixing the

first trigger to the aligned target word. In general,
this constraint performs slightly worse than the un-
constrained variant used in this work, but allows
for faster training and decoding.

<bodyText confidence="0.992014189189189">
Discriminative models have been shown to outper-
form generative models on many natural language
processing tasks. For machine translation, how-
ever, the adaptation of these methods is difficult
due to the large space of possible translations and
the size of the training data that has to be used to
achieve significant improvements.
In this section, we propose a discriminative
word lexicon model that follows (Bangalore et al.,
2007) and integrate it into the standard phrase-
based machine translation approach.
The core of our model is a classifier that pre-
dicts target words, given the words of the source
sentence. The structure of source as well as tar-
get sentence is neglected in this model. We do
not make any assumptions about the location of
the words in the sentence. This is useful in many
cases, as words and morphology can depend on in-
formation given at other positions in the sentence.
An example would be the character f in Chinese
that indicates a completed or past action and does
not need to appear close to the verb.
We model the probability of the set of target
words in a sentence e given the set of source words
f. For each word in the target vocabulary, we can
calculate a probability for being or not being in-
cluded in the set. The probability of the whole set
then is the product over the entire target vocabu-
lary VE:
For notational simplicity, we use the event e+
when the target word e is included in the target
sentence and e− if not. We model the individual
factors p(e|f) of the probability in Eq. 1 as a log-
linear model using the source words from f as bi-
nary features
φ(f , f) = { 0 else E f (2)
and feature weights λf,·:

eE{e+,e−} exp fEf λf,e φ(f, f)
(3)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999953733333333">
Subsequently, we will call this model discrimina-
tive word lexicon (DWL).
Modeling the lexicon on sets and not on se-
quences has two reasons. Phrase-based MT along
with n-gram language models is strong at predict-
ing sequences but only uses information from a lo-
cal context. By using global features and predict-
ing words in a non-local fashion, we can augment
the strong local decisions from the phrase-based
systems with sentence-level information.
For practical reasons, translating from a set to
a set simplifies the parallelization of the training
procedure. The classifiers for the target words can
be trained separately as explained in the following
section.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.920435">
3.1.1 Training
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999992238095238">
Common classification tasks have a relatively
small number of classes. In our case, the num-
ber of classes is the size of the target vocabulary.
For large translation tasks, this is in the range of a
hundred thousand classes. It is far from what con-
ventional out-of-the-box classifiers can handle.
The discriminative word lexicon model has the
convenient property that we can train a separate
model for each target word making paralleliza-
tion straightforward. Discussions about possible
classifiers and the choice of regularization can
be found in (Bangalore et al., 2007). We used
the freely available MegaM Toolkit1 for training,
which implements the L-BFGS method (Byrd et
al., 1995). Regularization is done using Gaussian
priors. We performed 100 iterations of the train-
ing algorithm for each word in the target vocabu-
lary. This results in a large number of classifiers to
be trained. For the Arabic-English data (cf. Sec-
tion 4), the training took an average of 38 seconds
per word. No feature cutoff was used.

smaller values tend to have less effect on the over-
all probability. In experiments we determined that
we could safely reduce the size of the final model
by a factor of ten without losing predictive power.
In search, we compute the model probabilities as
an additional model in the log-linear combination.
When scoring hypotheses from the phrase-based
system, we see the translation hypothesis as the
set of target words that are predicted. Words from
the target vocabulary which are not included in
the hypothesis are not part of the set. During the
search process, however, we also have to score in-
complete hypotheses where we do not know which
words will not be included. This problem is cir-
cumvented by rewriting Eq. 1 as

The first product is constant given a source sen-
tence and therefore does not affect the search. Us-
ing the model assumption from Eq. 3, we can fur-
ther simplify the computation and compute the
model score entirely in log-space which is numer-
ically stable even for large vocabularies. Exper-
iments showed that using only the first factor of
Eq. 1 is sufficient to obtain good results.
In comparison with the translation model from
(Bangalore et al., 2007) where a threshold on the
probability is used to determine which words are
included in the target sentence, our approach relies
on the phrase model to generate translation candi-
dates. This has several advantages: The length of
the translation is determined by the phrase model.
Words occurring multiple times in the translation
do not have to be explicitly modeled. In (Banga-
lore et al., 2007), repeated target words are treated
as distinct classes.
The main advantage of the integration being
done in a way as presented here is that the phrase
model and the discriminative word lexicon model
are complementary in the way they model the
translation. While the phrase model is good in
predicting translations in a local context, the dis-
criminative word lexicon model is able to predict
global aspects of the sentence like tense or vocabu-
lary changes in questions. While the phrase model
is closely tied to the structure of word and phrase
alignments, the discriminative word lexicon model
completely disregards the structure in source and
target sentences.

3.2 Trigger-based Lexicon Model
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999486736842105">
The triplets of the trigger-based lexicon model,
i.e. p(e|f, f&apos;), are composed of two words in the
source language triggering one target language
word. We chose this inverse direction since it
can be integrated directly into the decoder and,
thus, does not rely on a two-pass approach us-
ing reranking, as it is the case for (Hasan et al.,
2008). The triggers can originate from words of
the whole source sentence, also crossing phrase
boundaries of the conventional bilingual phrase
pairs. The model is symmetric though, mean-
ing that the order of the triggers is not relevant,
i.e. (f, f&apos; → e) = (f&apos;, f → e). Nevertheless,
the model is able to capture long-distance effects
such as verb splits or adjustments to lexical choice
of the target word given the topic-triggers of the
source sentence. In training, we determine the
probability of a target sentence eI1 given the source
sentence fJ1 within the model by

where f0 denotes the empty word and, thus, for
fj = ε, allows for modeling the conventional (in-
verse) IBM model 1 lexical probabilities as well.
Since the second trigger fj, always starts right of
the current first trigger, the model is symmetric
and does not need to look at all trigger pairs. Eq. 4
is used in the iterative EM training on all sentence
pairs of the training data which is described in
more detail in the following.

and normalize to obtain the final score (represent-

search, we can only use this direction, p(e|f, f&apos;),
since the whole source sentence is available for
triggering effects whereas not all target words
have been generated so far, as it would be neces-
sary for the standard direction, p(f|e, e&apos;).
Due to the enormous number of triplets, we
trained the model on a subset of the overall train-
ing data. The subcorpus, mainly consisting of
newswire articles, contained 1.4M sentence pairs
with 32.3M running words on the English side.
We trained two versions of the triplet lexicon, one
using 4 EM iterations and another one that was
trained for 10 EM iterations. Due to trimming
of triplets with small probabilities after each it-
eration, the version based on 10 iterations was
slightly smaller, having 164 million triplets but
also performed slightly worse. Thus, for the ex-
periments, we used the version based on 4 itera-
tions which contained 291 million triplets.
Note that decoding with this model can be quite
efficient if caching is applied. Since the given
source sentence does not change, we have to cal-

In this section we evaluate our lexicon models on
the GALE Chinese-English task for newswire and
web text translation and additionally on the of-
ficial NIST 2008 task for both Chinese-English
and Arabic-English. The baseline system was
built using a state-of-the art phrase-based MT sys-
tem (Zens and Ney, 2008). We use the standard
set of models with phrase translation probabilities
for source-to-target and target-to-source direction,
smoothing with lexical weights, a word and phrase
penalty, distance-based and lexicalized reordering
and a 5-gram (GALE) or 6-gram (NIST) target
language model.
We used training data provided by the Linguis-
tic Data Consortium (LDC) consisting of 9.1M
parallel Chinese-English sentence pairs of vari-
ous domains for GALE (cf. Table 1) and smaller
amounts of data for the NIST systems (cf. Ta-
ble 2). The DWL and Triplet models were inte-
grated into the decoder as presented in Section 3.
For the GALE development and test set, we sep-
arated the newswire and web text parts and did
separate parameter tuning for each genre using
the corresponding development set which consists
of 485 sentences for newswire texts and 533 sen-
tences of web text. The test set has 480 sentences
for newswire and 490 sentences for web text. For
NIST, we tuned on the official 2006 eval set and
used the 2008 evaluation set as a blind test set.

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99999083018868">
The translation results on the two GALE test
sets are shown in Table 3 for newswire and web
text. Both the discriminative word lexicon and the
triplet lexicon can individually improve the base-
line by approximately +0.6–0.9% BLEU and -0.5–
0.8% TER. For the combination of both lexicons
on the newswire setting, we observe only a slight
improvement on BLEU but also an additional
boost in TER reduction, arriving at +1% BLEU
and -1.2% TER. For web text, the findings are sim-
ilar: The combination of the discriminative and
trigger-based lexicons yields +1% BLEU and de-
creases TER by -0.5%.
We compared these results against an inverse
IBM model 1 but the results were inconclusive
which is consistent with the results presented in
(Och et al., 2004) where no improvements were
achieved using p(e|f). In our case, inverse IBM1
improves results by 0.2–0.4% BLEU on the devel-
opment set but does not show the same trend on
the test sets. Furthermore, combining IBM1 with
DWL or Triplets often even degraded the transla-
tion results, e.g. only 32.8% BLEU was achieved
on newswire for a combination of the IBM1, DWL
and Triplet model. In contrast, combinations of
the DWL and Triplet model did not degrade per-
formance and could benefit from each other.
In addition to the automatic scoring, we also
did a randomized subjective evaluation where the
hypotheses of the baseline was compared against
the hypotheses generated using the discrimina-
tive word lexicon and triplet models. We evalu-
ated 200 sentences from newswire and web text.
In 80% of the evaluated sentences, the improved
models were judged equal or better than the base-
line.
We tested the presented lexicon models also on
another large-scale system, i.e. NIST, for two lan-
guage pairs, namely Chinese-English and Arabic-
English. Interestingly, the results obtained for
Arabic-English are similar to the findings for
Chinese-English, as can be seen in Table 4. The
overall improvements for this language pair are
+1% BLEU and -1.4% TER. In contrast to the
GALE Chinese-English task, the triplet lexicon
model for the Arabic-English language pair per-
forms slightly better than the discriminative word
lexicon.
These results strengthen the claim that the pre-
sented models are capable of improving lexical
choice of the MT system. In the next section, we
discuss the observed effects and analyze our re-
sults in more detail.

In terms of automatic evaluation measures, the re-
sults indicate that it is helpful to incorporate the
extended lexicon models into the search process.
In this section, we will analyze some more details
of the models and take a look at the lexical choice
they make and what differentiates them from the
baseline models. In Table 5, we picked an ex-
ample sentence from the GALE newswire test set
and show the different hypotheses produced by our
system. As can be seen, the baseline does not
produce the present participle of the verb restore
which makes the sentence somewhat hard to un-
derstand. Both the discriminative and the trigger-
based lexicon approach are capable of generating
this missing information, i.e. the correct use of
restoring. Figure 1 gives an example how discon-
tinuous triggers affect the word choice on the tar-
get side. Two cases are depicted where high proba-
bilities of triplets including emergency and restor-
ing on the target side influence the overall hypoth-
esis selection. The non-local modeling advantages
of the triplet model can be observed as well: The

triggering events do not need to be located next
to each other or within a given phrase pair. They
move across the whole source sentence, thus al-
lowing for capturing of long-range dependencies.
Table 6 shows the top ten content words that are
predicted by the two models, discriminative word
lexicon and triplet lexicon model. IBM model 1
ranks are indicated by subscripts in the column
of the triplet model. Although the triplet model
is similar to IBM1, we observe differences in the
word lists. Comparing this to the visualization of
the probability distribution for the example sen-
tence, cf. Figure 2, we argue that, although the
IBM1 and Triplet distributions look similar, the
triplet model is sharper and favors words such as
the ones in Table 6, resulting in different word
choice in the translation process. In contrast, the
DWL approach gives more distinct probabilities,
selecting content words that are not chosen by the
other models.
Table 7 shows an example from the web text
test set. Here, the baseline hypothesis contains
an incorrect word, anna, which might have been
mistaken for the name ying. Interestingly, the hy-
potheses of the DWL lexicon and the combina-
tion of DWL and Triplet contain the correct con-
tent word remarks. The triplet model makes an er-
ror by selecting music, an artifact that might come
from words that co-occur frequently with the cor-
responding Chinese verb to listen, i.e. PR, in the
data. Although the TER score of the baseline is
better than the one for the alternative models for
this particular example, we still think that the ob-
served effects show how our models help produc-
ing different hypotheses that might lead to subjec-
tively better translations.
An Arabic-English translation example is
shown in Table 8. Here, the term incidents of mur-
der in apartments was chosen over the baseline’s
killings inside the flats. Both translations are un-
derstandable and the difference in the wording is
only based on synonyms. The translation using
the discriminative and trigger-based lexicons bet-
ter matches the reference translation and, thus, re-
flects a better lexical choice of the content words.

We have presented two lexicon models that use
global source sentence context and are capable
of predicting context-specific target words. The
models have been directly integrated into the de-
coder and have shown to improve the translation
quality of a state-of-the-art phrase-based machine
translation system. The first model was a dis-
criminative word lexicon that uses sentence-level
features to predict if a word from the target vo-
cabulary should be included in the translation or
not. The second model was a trigger-based lexi-

con that uses triplets to model long-range depen-
dencies in the data. The source word triggers can
move across the whole sentence and capture the
topic of the sentence and incorporate more fine-
grained lexical choice of the target words within
the decoder.
Overall improvements are up to +1% in BLEU
and -1.5% in TER on large-scale systems for
Chinese-English and Arabic-English. Compared
to the inverse IBM model 1 which did not yield
consistent improvements, the presented models
are valuable additional features in a phrase-based
statistical machine translation system. We will test
this setup for other language pairs and expect that
languages like German where long-distance ef-
fects are common can benefit from these extended
lexicon models.
In future work, we plan to extend the discrimi-
native word lexicon model in two directions: ex-
tending context to the document level and feature
engineering. For the trigger-based model, we plan
to investigate more model variants. It might be
interesting to look at cross-lingual trigger mod-
els such as p(f|e, f&apos;) or constrained variants like
p(f|e, e&apos;) with pos(e&apos;) &lt; pos(e), i.e. the second

For machine translation, however, the adaptation of these methods is difficult due to the large space of possible translations and the size of the training data that has to be used to achieve significant improvements. In this section, we propose a discriminative word lexicon model that follows (Bangalore et al., 2007) and integrate it into the standard phrasebased machine translation approach. The core of our model is a classifier that predicts target words, given the words of the source sentence. The structure of source as well as target sentence is neglected in this model. We do not make any assumptions about the location of the words in the sentence. This is useful in many cases, as words and morphology can depend on information given at other positions in the sentence. An example would be the character f in Chinese that indicates a completed or past action and does not need to appear close to the verb.</context>
<context position="11730" citStr="Bangalore et al., 2007" startWordPosition="1937" endWordPosition="1940"> explained in the following section. 3.1.1 Training Common classification tasks have a relatively small number of classes. In our case, the number of classes is the size of the target vocabulary. For large translation tasks, this is in the range of a hundred thousand classes. It is far from what conventional out-of-the-box classifiers can handle. The discriminative word lexicon model has the convenient property that we can train a separate model for each target word making parallelization straightforward. Discussions about possible classifiers and the choice of regularization can be found in (Bangalore et al., 2007). We used the freely available MegaM Toolkit1 for training, which implements the L-BFGS method (Byrd et al., 1995). Regularization is done using Gaussian priors. We performed 100 iterations of the training algorithm for each word in the target vocabulary. This results in a large number of classifiers to be trained. For the Arabic-English data (cf. Section 4), the training took an average of 38 seconds per word. No feature cutoff was used. 3.1.2 Decoding In search, we compute the model probabilities as an additional model in the log-linear model combination of the phrase-based translation appro</context>

This problem is circumvented by rewriting Eq. 1 as P(e|f) = P(e−|f) · eEVE eEe Y Y P(e+|f) P(e−|f). The first product is constant given a source sentence and therefore does not affect the search. Using the model assumption from Eq. 3, we can further simplify the computation and compute the model score entirely in log-space which is numerically stable even for large vocabularies. Experiments showed that using only the first factor of Eq. 1 is sufficient to obtain good results. In comparison with the translation model from (Bangalore et al., 2007) where a threshold on the probability is used to determine which words are included in the target sentence, our approach relies on the phrase model to generate translation candidates. This has several advantages: The length of the translation is determined by the phrase model. Words occurring multiple times in the translation do not have to be explicitly modeled. In (Bangalore et al., 2007), repeated target words are treated as distinct classes. The main advantage of the integration being done in a way as presented here is that the phrase model and the discriminative word lexicon model are com</context>

In Chinese, for example, tenses are often encoded by indicator words and particles whose position is relatively free in the sentence. In German, prefixes of verbs can be moved over long distances towards the end of the sentence. In this work, we propose two models that can be categorized as extensions of standard word lexicons: A discriminative word lexicon that uses global, i.e. sentence-level source information to predict the target words using a statistical classifier and a trigger-based lexicon model that extends the well-known IBM model 1 (Brown et al., 1993) with a second trigger, allowing for a more finegrained lexical choice of target words. The loglinear framework of the discriminative word lexicon offers a high degree of flexibility in the selection of features. Other sources of information such as syntax or morphology can be easily integrated. The trigger-based lexicon model, or simply triplet model since it is based on word triplets, is not trained discriminatively but uses the classical maximum likelihood approach (MLE) instead. We train the triplets iteratively on a training corpus using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. We wil</context>

The authors of (Venkatapathy and Bangalore, 2007) propose three different models. The first one is a global lexical selection model which includes all words of the source sentence as features, regardless of their position. Using these features, the system predicts the words that should be included in the target sentence. Sentence structure is then reconstructed using permutations of the generated bag of target words. We will also use this type of features in our model. One of the simplest models in the context of lexical triggers is the IBM model 1 (Brown et al., 1993) which captures lexical dependencies between source and target words. It can be seen as a lexicon containing correspondents of translations of source and target words in a very broad sense since the pairs are trained on the full sentence level. The trigger-based lexicon model used in this work follows the training procedure introduced in (Hasan et al., 2008) and is integrated directly in the decoder instead of being applied in n-best list reranking. The model is very close to the IBM model 1 and can be seen as an extension of it by taking another word into the conditioning part, i.e. the trigg</context>

For large translation tasks, this is in the range of a hundred thousand classes. It is far from what conventional out-of-the-box classifiers can handle. The discriminative word lexicon model has the convenient property that we can train a separate model for each target word making parallelization straightforward. Discussions about possible classifiers and the choice of regularization can be found in (Bangalore et al., 2007). We used the freely available MegaM Toolkit1 for training, which implements the L-BFGS method (Byrd et al., 1995). Regularization is done using Gaussian priors. We performed 100 iterations of the training algorithm for each word in the target vocabulary. This results in a large number of classifiers to be trained. For the Arabic-English data (cf. Section 4), the training took an average of 38 seconds per word. No feature cutoff was used. 3.1.2 Decoding In search, we compute the model probabilities as an additional model in the log-linear model combination of the phrase-based translation approach. To reduce the memory footprint and startup time of the decoding process, we reduced the number of 1http://www</context>

For the combination of both lexicons on the newswire setting, we observe only a slight improvement on BLEU but also an additional boost in TER reduction, arriving at +1% BLEU and -1.2% TER. For web text, the findings are similar: The combination of the discriminative and trigger-based lexicons yields +1% BLEU and decreases TER by -0.5%. We compared these results against an inverse IBM model 1 but the results were inconclusive which is consistent with the results presented in (Och et al., 2004) where no improvements were achieved using p(e|f). In our case, inverse IBM1 improves results by 0.2–0.4% BLEU on the development set but does not show the same trend on the test sets. Furthermore, combining IBM1 with DWL or Triplets often even degraded the translation results, e.g. only 32.8% BLEU was achieved on newswire for a combination of the IBM1, DWL and Triplet model. In contrast, combinations of the DWL and Triplet model did not degrade performance and could benefit from each other.
