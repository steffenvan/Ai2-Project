Abstract

The paper presents two rule-based infor-
mation extraction (IE) from two types of
patients’ documentation in Polish. For
both document types, values of sets of at-
tributes were assigned using specially de-
signed grammars.

1 Method/General Assumptions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999782434782609">
Various rule-based, statistical, and machine learn-
ing methods have been developed for the purpose
of information extraction. Unfortunately, they have
rarely been tested on Polish texts, whose rich in-
flectional morphology and relatively free word or-
der is challenging. Here, we present results of two
experiments aimed at extracting information from
mammography reports and hospital records of dia-
betic patients.1 Since there are no annotated corpora
of Polish medical text which can be used in super-
vised statistical methods, and we do not have enough
data for weakly supervised methods, we chose the
rule-based extraction schema. The processing pro-
cedure in both experiments consisted of four stages:
text preprocessing, application of IE rules based on
the morphological information and domain lexicons,
postprocessing (data cleaning and structuring), and
conversion into a relational database.
Preprocessing included format unification, data
anonymization, and (for mammography reports) au-
tomatic spelling correction.
The extraction rules were defined as grammars
of the SProUT system, (Dro˙zd˙zy´nski et al., 2004).

<bodyText confidence="0.999820684210526">
SProUT consists of a set of processing components
for basic linguistic operations, including tokeniza-
tion, sentence splitting, morphological analysis (for
Polish we use Morfeusz (Woli´nski, 2006)) and
gazetteer lookup. The SproUT components are com-
bined into a pipeline that generates typed feature
structures (TFS), on which rules in the form of reg-
ular expressions with unification can operate. Small
specialized lexicons containing both morphologi-
cal and semantic (concept names) information have
been created for both document types.
Extracted attribute values are stored in a rela-
tional database.2 Before that, mammography re-
ports results undergo additional postprocessing —
grouping together of extracted data. Specially de-
signed scripts put limits that separate descriptions of
anatomical changes, tissue structure, and diagnosis.
More details about mammography IE system can be
found in (Mykowiecka et al., 2005).

2 Document types
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999194">
For both document types, partial ontologies were de-
fined on the basis of sample data and expert knowl-
edge. To formalize them, we used OWL-DL stan-
dard and the Protege ontology editor. The excerpt
from the ontology is presented in Fig. 1.
In both cases, the relevant part of the ontology
was translated into a TFS hierarchy. This resulted in
176 types with 66 attributes for the mammography
domain, and 139 types (including 75 drug names)
with 65 attributes for diabetic patients’ records.

3 Extraction Grammars
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999803">
The number of rules is highly related to the number
of attributes and possible ways of formulating their
values. The grammar for mammography reports
contains 190 rules; that for hospital records contains
about 100 rules. For the first task, nearly the entire
text is covered by the rules, while for the second,
only a small part of the text is extracted (e.g., from
many blood tests we are interested only in HBA1C).
Polish inflection is handled by using the morpho-
logical analyzer and by inserting the most frequent
morphological forms into the gazetteer. Free word
order is handled either by rules which describe all
possible orderings, or by extracting small pieces of
information which are merged at the postprocessing
stage. Fig. 2 presents a fragment of one mammog-
raphy note and its output. The zp and zk markers are
inserted during the information structuring stage to
represent borders of an anatomical change descrip-
tion. Similar markers are introduced to structure the
tissue description part.

The experiments were evaluated on a set of previ-
ously unseen reports. Extraction of the following
structures was evaluated: 1) simple attributes (e.g.
diabetes balance); 2) structured attributes (e.g. lo-
calization); and 3) complex structures (e.g. descrip-
tion of abnormal findings). Evaluation of three se-
lected attributes from both sets is given in Fig. 3.

Despite the fact that rule based extraction is typi-
cally seen as too time consuming, we claim that in
the case of very detailed information searching, de-
signing rules on the basis of expert knowledge is in
fact a method of a real practical value. In the next
stage, we plan to use our tools for creating anno-
tated corpora of medical texts (manually corrected).
These data can be used to train statistical IE models
and to evaluate other extraction systems.
