1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99985816">
Sublanguages represent an important application area for
NLU (Grishman and Kittredge,1986). Their syntactic
simplicity and reduced semantic variability provide clear
computational advantages. In the present paper we consider a
sublanguage currently used for official publication of
business activities which is characterized by a telegraphic
style typical of commercial ads. Morphological and syntactic
ill-formedness is very frequent within this sublanguage,
hence a robust parser is a must.
The corpus we have considered was extracted from the
on-line archives of the Italian Chambers of Commerce, and
contains about 4 million descriptions of economic activities.
They represent an important source of information about the
structure of the Italian economy. Since our main goal is
intelligent information retrieval, only a part of the
information contained in the sentences is considered relevant.
Basically, the kind of information we are interested in
involves nouns, prepositions and noun modifiers, and
involves verbs only in their nominalizal or infinitive form.
The peculiarity of the parsing approach described in the
paper consists in the fact that we limit the syntactic analysis
to the elementary relationships occurring among these
elements, discarding whatever is not recognized by the
morphological analyzer and giving up the attempt to
reconstruct the syntactic tree of the whole sentence.

<bodyText confidence="0.9999836">
As we can see, the utterances are mostly formed by
complex noun phrases rather than complete sentences, in
which the number of constituents and the nesting degree
may be rather high. Ellipses of prepositions and/or
coordinating conjunctions are also frequent; the use of
adjectives is relatively poor, and, when used, they generally
bind the technical component of the information; the use of
locutions with adjectival function is also common. Finally,
the usage of verbs is quite scanty, and restricted to
conversational parts; lexical mistakes are also recurrent.
In their basic version, these noun phrases are formed
either by a single noun or by a group of the form NI -P-N2
(noun, preposition, noun) where Ni is associated with an
economic activity, and N2 with the object of this activity
linked by a preposition, which is often absent.

3 Syntactic analysis
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9235155">
The core of our approach is the extraction of elementary
syntactic relationships (ESR) from a possibly ill-formed
sentence. ESR&apos;s are described by a definite clause grammar
(DCG), a fragment of which appears in Fig.l. Due to the
presence of the special symbol skip in the right side of the
rules, this grammar turns to be a special, very simple case
of a discontinuous grammar (Dahl, 1989).

The introduction of the skip allows us to ignore
unknown or ill-formed words, and accounts in a very
compact way for the positional variations of the structure
elements.

4 The system
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999986619047619">
Input text first passes through a morphological analyzer
similar to the one used in (Antonacci et al., 1988). Before
undergoing syntactical analysis, the relevant phrases
occurring within descriptions are isolated by taking into
account the coarse semantic trait (activities vs. activity
objects) of the nouns involved. After a single description has
been analyzed by our grammar, ESR&apos;s undergo an
intermediate processing in order to reduce morphological and
syntactic ambiguity and to take into account ellipses and
conjunctions. These phenomena are handled by employing
preference schemes improved by semantic control (Hobbs
and Bear, 1990).
Finally, ESR&apos;s are converted into conceptual
relationships by using a many-to-many mapping between
syntactic and conceptual relations similar to the one used in
(Antonacci et al., 1988); conceptual relationships are
subsequently validated by using a semantic knowledge base,
and finally merged into a semantic tree. The knowledge
representation technique adopted is inspired by the ITL
system (Guarino, 1991), where semantic validation reduces
to order-sorted unification.

5 Preliminary results
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999964625">
A prototype of the system has been implemented on
Macintosh workstation in LPA MacProlog. It has been
tested on a significative fragment of our corpus (about 2000
descriptions in the areas of agriculture and services).
The output of the system has been manually tested by a
linguist, for correctness and completeness. Errors turn out to
be independent of the syntactic algorithm, and are mainly
due to (i) lack of semantic knowledge; (ii) lack of lexical
knowledge (unknown or ill-formed words); (iii) difficulties
with disambiguation and phrase separation.
The query system is now under developmeni
As far as system efficiency is concerned, the time
complexity of the whole analysis process seems to be
almost quadratic with respect to the length of the sentence,
while the mean understanding time is well below 10 seconds
on a Macintosh IIfx.

6 Discussion and conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999926875">
We would like to make clear that the approach we have
presented is seriously limited, by the fact that we are not
able to fully exploit syntactic information. This means that
complete sentences containing verbs and subordinate clauses
cannot be properly handled. However, our experiments show
that the approach behaves well in the field of real business
descriptions.
Semantic knowledge plays a fundamental role in our
system, as it has to validate the syntactic relationships
proposed by the shallow parsing algorithm. Currently, our
knowledge base consists of a taxonomy of 3000 concepts,
together with 360 semantic constraints for the conceptual
relations. Although the current prototype uses a hand-written
knowledge base, some techniques for semi-automatic
extraction of semantic knowledge from our large corpus have
been studied in our project (Velardi etal., 1991). The idea is
that the non-ambiguous sentence fragments present in the
corpus capture specific word usage patterns, which, via a
human-controlled generalization process, may generate the
kind of semantic constraints we are looking for to put in the
knowledge base.
A full syntactic parsing would be too expensive for large
corpora, and it would also fail to consider useful information
embedded within ill-formed sentences. The encouraging
preliminary results indicate that our approach constitutes a
good compromise between syntactic completeness and
meaning extraction.
In conclusion, the shallow parsing algorithm we have
described may play a crucial role in order to trigger a boot-
strapping process of knowledge acquisition, giving us some
chance to overcome, at least in our domain, a major bottle-
neck in natural language understanding.
