This paper gives an account of the role tense plays in
the listener&apos;s reconstruction of the events and situations a
speaker has chosen to describe. Several new ideas are
presented; (a) that tense is better viewed by analogy with
definite NPs than with pronouns; (b) that a narrative has a
temporal focus that grounds the context-dependency of
tense; and (c) that focus management heuristics can be
used to track the movement of temporal focus.1

1. Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999385">
My basic premise is that in processing a narrative text,
a listener is building up a representation of the speaker&apos;s
view of the events and situations being described and of
their relationship to one another. This representation,
which I will call an event/situation structure or 6/s
structure, reflects the listener&apos;s best effort at interpreting
the speaker&apos;s ordering of those events and situations in
time and space. The listener&apos;s problem can therefore be
viewed as that of establishing where in the evolving e/s
structure to attach the event or situation described in the
next clause. My claim is that the discourse interpretation of
tense contributes to the solution of this problem.
This work on the discourse interpretation of tense is
being carried out in the context of a larger enterprise
whose goal is an account of explicit anaphoric reference to
events and situations, as in Example 1.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.717733">
Example 1,

<bodyText confidence="0.99849240625">
It&apos;s always been presumed that when the glaciers
receded, the area got very hot. The Folsum men
couldn&apos;t adapt, and they died out. That&apos;s what&apos;s
supposed to have happened. It&apos;s the textbook dogma.
But it&apos;s wrong. They were human and smart. They
adapted their weapons and culture, and they survived.
Example 1 shows that one may refer anaphorically to
structured entities built up through multiple clauses. Thus
an account of how clauses arrange themselves into
structures is necessary to an account of event reference.2
&apos;This work was partially supported by ARO grant DAA29-84-9-0027,
NSF grant MCS-8219116-CER, and DARPA grant N00014-85-K-0018 to
the University of Pennsylvania, and by DARPA grant N00014-85-C-0012 to
UNISYS.
30ther parts of the enterprise include a general mechanism for
individuating composite entities made up of ones separately introduced
[20, 211 and a representation for events that allow for anaphoric reference
to both particular events and situations and to abstractions thereof [161.
In this paper, I will relate the problem of building up an
e/s structure to what has been described as the
anaphoric property of tense [7, 11, 6, 1, 12] and of relative
temporal adverbials [181 Anaphora are expressions
whose specification is context-dependent. Tense and
relative temporal adverbials, I interpret as specifying
positions in an evolving e/s structure. My view of their
anaphoric nature is that the particular positions they can
specify depend on the current context. And the current
context only makes a few positions accessible. (This I will
claim to be in contrast with the ability of temporal
subordinate clauses and noun phrases (NPs) to direct the
listener to any position in the evolving structure.)
The paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, I
discuss tense as an anaphoric device. Previous work in
this area has discussed how tense is anaphoric, claiming
as well that it is like a pronoun. While agreeing as to the
source of the anaphoric character of tense, I do not think
the analogy with pronouns has been productive. In
contrast, I discuss what I believe to be a more productive
analogy between tense and definite noun phrases.
Previous work has focussed on the interpretation of
tensed clauses in simple linear narratives (i.e., narratives
in which the order of underlying events directly
corresponds to their order of presentation).3 Here the
most perplexing question involves when the next clause in
a sequence is interpreted as an event or sequence
coincident with the previous one and when, as following
the previous one [4, 6, 12]. In Section 3, I show that if one
moves beyond simple linear narratives, there are more
options. In terms of the framework proposed here, there
may be more than one position in the evolving e/s
structure which can provide a context for the
interpretation of tense. Hence there may be more than one
position in e/s structure which tense can specify and
which the new event or situation can attach to.
To model the possible contexts, I introduce a
discourse-level focussing mechanism - temporal focus or
TF - similar to that proposed for interpreting pronouns and
definite NPs [17]. I give examples to show that change of
TF is intimately bound up with narrative structure. To keep
track of and predict its movement, I propose a set of focus
heuristics: one Focus Maintenance Heuristic, predicting
regular movement forward, two Embedded Discourse
Heuristics for stacking the focus and embarking on an
embedded narrative, and one Focus Resumption

3Another person currently addressing the interpretation of tense and
aspect in more complex narratives is Nakhimovsky [9, 101. Though we are
addressing somewhat different issues, his approach seems very

Heuristic for returning and resuming the current narrative.
The need for each of these is shown by example.
In Section 4, I show that relative temporal adverbials
display the same anaphoric property as simple tense.
That the interpretation of tense should be entwined
with discourse structure in this way should not come as a
surprise, as a similar thing has been found true of other
discourse anaphora [5].

2. Tense as Anaphor
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.961101">
Tense does not seem prima facie anaphoric: an
isolated sentence like &amp;quot;John went to bed&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;I met a man
who looked like a basset hound&amp;quot; appears to make sense
without previously establishing when it happened. On the
other hand, if some time or event is established by the
context, tense will invariably be interpreted with respect to
it, as in:
Example 2
After he finished his chores, John went to bed.
John partied until 3am. He came home and went
to bed.
In each case, John&apos;s going to bed is linked to an explictly
mentioned time or event. This linkage is the anaphoric
property of tense that previous authors have described.
Hinrichs (6] and Bauerle (1], following McCawley
[7] and Partee [11], showed that it is not tense per se that
is interpreted anaphorically, but that part of tense called by
Reichenbach [14] reference time.4 According to
Reichenbach, the interpretation of tense requires three
notions: speech time (ST), event time (ET), and
reference time (RT). RT is the time from which the
evenvsituation described in the sentence is viewed. It may
be the same as ST, as in
present perfect: ET&lt;RT-ST
John has climbed Aconcagua and Mt. McKinley.
simple, present: ET.RT=ST
John is in the lounge.
the same as ET, as in
simple past: ET-RT&lt;ST
John climbed Aconcagua.
simple future: ST&lt;ET.RT
John will climb Aconcagua.
in between ET and ST, as in
aast perfecti ET&lt;RT&lt;ST
John had climbed Aconcagua.
or following both ET and ST (looking back to them), as in
&apos;Hinrichs&apos; work is discussed as well in (121.
future perfect: ST&lt;ET&lt;RT
John will have climbed Mt. McKinley.
That it is RT that it is interpreted anaphorically, and not
either ET or tense as a whole can be seen by considering
Example 3.
Example 3
John went to the hospital.
He had twisted his ankle on a patch of ice.
It is not the ET of John&apos;s twisting his ankle that is
interpreted anaphorically with respect to his going to the
hospital. Rather, it is the AT of the second clause: its ET is
interpreted as prior to that because the clause is in the
past perfect tense (see above).
Having said that it is the AT of tense whose
interpretation is anaphoric, the next question to ask is what
kind of anaphoric behavior it evinces. In previous work,
tense is claimed to behave like a pronoun. Partee
[12] makes the strongest case, claiming that pronouns
and tense display the same range of antecedent-anaphor
linkages:

&lt;Maly phoned at time t on a Friday, Sam was

Because of this similarity, Partee and others have claimed
that tense is like a pronoun. Their account of how time is
then seen to advance in simple linear narratives is
designed, in part, to get around the problem that while
pronouns co-specify with their antecedents, the RT of
clause N cannot just co-specify the same time as the
previous clause [6, 12, 41.
There is another option though: one can draw an
analogy between tense and definite NPs, which are also
anaphoric. Support for this analogy is that, like a definite

the speaker is distraught and making no attempt to be cooperative. It
happens. But that doesn&apos;t mean that pronouns have deictic antecedents. I

NP, tense can cause the listener to create something new.
With a definite NP, that something new is a new discourse
entity (19]. With tense, I will say for now that it is a new
time at which the event or situation is interpreted as
occuring.6 If one looks at texts other than simple linear
narratives, this ability becomes clear, as the following
simple example shows:
Example 4
I was at Mary&apos;s house yesterday.
We talked about her brother.
He spent 5 weeks in Alaska with two friends.
Together, they made a successful assault on Denali.
Mary was very proud of him.
The event of Mary&apos;s brother spending five weeks in Alaska
is not interpreted as occurring either coincident with or
after the event of my conversation with Mary. Rather, the
events corresponding to the embedded narrative in the
third and fourth clause are interpreted at a different spatio-
temporal location than the conversation. That it is before
the conversation is a matter of world knowledge. In the e/s
structure for the whole narrative, the tense of the third
clause would set up a new position for the events of the
embedded narrative, ordered prior to the current position,
to site these events.
The claimed analogy of tense with pronouns is based
on the similarity in antecedent-anaphor linkages they
display. But notice that definite NPs can display the same
linkages in two different ways: (1) the definite NP can co-
specify with its antecedent, as in the a. examples below,
and (2) the definite NP can specify a new entity that is
&apos;strongly&apos; associated with the antecedent and is unique by
virtue of that association, as in the b. examples below7

<bodyText confidence="0.9906495625">
Thus the range of antecedent-anaphor behavior that
Partee calls attention to argues equally for an analogy
between tense and pronouns as for an analgoy between
tense and definite NPs.
°After I say more about eis structure construction, I will be able to claim
that tense can cause the listener to create a new position in *As structure
at which to attach the event or situation described in its associated clause.
7Clark 8 Marshall [2] are among those who have described the
necessary &amp;quot;common knowledge&apos; that must be assumable by speaker and
listener about the association for the specification to be successful.
However, there are two more features of behavior to
consider: On the one hand, as noted earlier, definite NPs
have a capability that pronouns lacks. That is, they can
introduce a new entity into the discourse that is &apos;strongly&apos;
associated with the antecedent and is unique by virtue of
that association, as in the b. examples above. Example 4
shows that tense has a similar ability. Thus, a stronger
analogy can be drawn between tense and definite NPs.
On the other hand, definite NPs have the capability to
move the listener away from the current focus to a
particular entity introduced earlier or a particular entity
associated with it. This ability tense lacks. While tense
can set up a new node in e/s structure that is strongly
associated with its &apos;antecedent&apos;, it does not convey
sufficient information to position that node precisely - for
example, precisely relative to some other event or
situation the listener has been told about. Thus its
resemblance to definite NPs is only partial, although it is
stronger-than its resemblance to pronouns. To locate a
node precisely in e/s structure requires the full temporal
correlate of a definite NP - that is, a temporal subordinate
clause or a definite NP itself, as in Example 5.
Example 5
The bus reached the Stadium, terminal for the suburban
bus services. Here De Witt had to change to a streetcar.
The wind had abated but the rain kept falling, almost
vertically now. He was travelling to a two o&apos;clock
appointment at Amsterdam police headquarters in the
center of town, and he was sure to be late.
When De Witt got to the police president&apos;s office, he
telephoned his house.
[adapted from Hans Koning, De Witt&apos;s War]
Notice that without the &amp;quot;when&amp;quot; clause, the simple past
tense of &amp;quot;he telephoned his house&amp;quot; would be anaphorically
interpreted with respect to the &amp;quot;reaching the Stadium&amp;quot;
event, as happening sometime after that. A new node
would be created in e/s structure ordered sometime after
the &amp;quot;reaching the Stadium&amp;quot; event. On the other hand, with
the &amp;quot;when&amp;quot; clause, that new node can be ordered more
precisely after the &amp;quot;reaching the Stadium&amp;quot; event. By
association with its &amp;quot;antecedent&amp;quot; (the &amp;quot;travelling to the
appointment&amp;quot; event), it can be ordered after the
achievement of that event.
There is another advantage to be gained by pushing
further the analogy between tense and definite NPs that
relates to the problem tackled in [6, 4, 12] of how to
reconcile the anaphoric nature of tense with the fact that
the event or situation described in the next clause varies
as to whether it is taken to be coincident with, during,
before or after the event or situation described in the
previous clause. This I will discuss in the next section,
after introducing the notion of temporal focus.
°except for &amp;quot;pronouns of laziness&amp;quot; which can evoke and specify new
entities through the use of previous descriptions

3. Temporal Focus
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999934358974359">
In this section, I give a more specific account of how
the discourse interpretation of tense relates to e/s
structure construction.
At any point N in the discourse, there is one node of
e/s structure that provides a context for the interpretation
of the AT of the next clause. I will call it the temporal
focus or TF. There are three possibilities: (1) the AT of
the next clause will be interpreted anaphorically against
the current TF, (2) the TF will shift to a different node of
eis structure.- either one already in the structure or one
created in recognition of an embedded narrative - and the
AT interpreted with respect to that node, or (3) the TF will
return to the node previously labelled TF, after completing
an embedded narrative, as in (2), and the AT interpreted
there. These three behaviors are described by four focus
management heuristics described in this section: a Focus
Maintenance Heuristic, two Embedded Discourse
Heuristics and a Focus Resumption Heuristic.9
In (21), I presented a control structure in which these
heuristics were applied serially. The next heuristic would
only be applied when the prediction of the previous one
was rejected on grounds of &amp;quot;semantic or pragmatic
inconsistency&amp;quot;. I now believe this is an unworkable
hypothesis. Maintaining it requires (1) identifying grounds
for such rejection and (2) arguing that one can reject
proposals, independent of knowing the alternatives.
I now don&apos;t believe that either can be done. It is rarely
the case that one cannot come up with a story linking two
events and/or situations. Thus it would be impossible to
reject a hypothesis on grounds of inconsistency. All one
can say is that one of such stories might be more plausible
than the others by requiring, in some sense not explored
here, fewer inferences.&amp;quot;)
Thus I would now describe these heuristics as running
in parallel, with the most plausible prediction being the one
that ends up updating both e/s structure and the TF. For
clarity in presentation though, I will introduce each
heuristic separately, at the point that the next example
calls for it.

3.1. Interpreting RT against TF
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.969340851851852">
Before presenting the temporal focus management
heuristics, I want to say a bit more about what it can mean
to interpret the RT of the next clause against the current
TF. This discussion points out the additional advantage to
&apos;Rohrer (151 suggests that there may exist a set of possible temporal
referents, possibly ordered by saliency, among which the tense in a
sentence may find its reference time, but doesn&apos;t elaborate how. That is
the only thing I have seen that comes close to the =rent proposal.
&apos;train and Steedman (3) make a similar argument about prepositional
phrase (PP) attachment. For example, it is not impossible for a cat to own a
telescope - e.g., by inheritance from its former owner. Thus &amp;quot;a cat with a
telescope&apos; is not an inconsistent description. However, it must compete
with other plausible interpretations like &amp;quot;seeing with a telescope&amp;quot; in &amp;quot;I saw a
cat with a telescope&apos;.
be gained by pushing the analogy between tense and
definite NPs.
As I noted above, a definite NP can specify an entity
&apos;strongly&apos; associated with its antecedent. One might thus
consider what is &apos;strongly&apos; associated with an event. One
answer to this question appears in two separate papers in
this volume [8, 131, each ascribing a tripartite structure to
the way we view and talk about events. This structure
consists of a preparatory phase, a culmination, and a
consequence phase, to use the terminology of [8]. (Such a
structure is proposed, in part, to give a uniform account of
how the interpretation of temporal adverbials interacts with
the interpretation of tense and aspect.)
Nodes in eis structure correspond to events and
situations, as the speaker conceives them. If one
associates such a structure with the node labelled the
current TF, then one can say that &apos;strongly&apos; associated
with it are events and situations that could make up its
preparatory phase, culmination or consequence phase.
Like a definite NP, the AT of tense may either co-specify
the current TF or set up a new node in e/s structure
&apos;strongly&apos; associated with the TF. In the latter case, its
corresponding event or situation will be interpreted as
being part of one of these three phases, depending on the
speaker and listener&apos;s assumed shared knowledge.
Since, arguably, the most common way of perceiving the
world is as an ordered sequence of events, this will
increase the plausibility of interpreting the next event or
situation as (1) still associated with the current TF and (2)
part of the consequence phase of that event (i.e., after it).
On the other hand, this &apos;strong association&apos; treatment no
longer limits anaphoric interpretation to &amp;quot;co-specify&amp;quot; or
&amp;quot;right after&apos; as in (4, 6, 121. The event described can be
anaphorically associated with the the whole event
structure (Example 6a), the consequence phase (Example
6b - &amp;quot;right after&amp;quot;), or the preparatory phase (Example 6c -
&amp;quot;before&amp;quot;).

and headed east to Fort Dodge.
Deciding which of these three options holds in a given
case demands an appeal to world knowledge (e.g. which
actions can be performed simultaneously by a single
agent). This is yet another area demanding further study
and is not treated in this paper.&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;Mark Steedman shares responsibility for this idea, which is also
mentioned in his paper with Marc Moens in this volume (8].

Since the first two clauses are the same in these
examples, I will explain them together.
With no previous temporal focus (TF) established
prior to clause 1, the listener creates a new node of e/s
structure, ordered prior to now, to serve as TF. TF sites
the anaphoric interpretation of RTi, which, because clause
1 is in the simple past, also sites ETi. This is shown
roughly in Figure 3-1.

immediately following the TF. Since RT3 in turn directly
sites ET3 (clause 3 being simple past), the &amp;quot;failing event&amp;quot;
is interpreted as immediately following the &amp;quot;going over to
Mary&apos;s house&amp;quot; event. This is shown roughly in Figure 3-3.

To get the most plausible interpretation of 7b - i.e.,
where the &amp;quot;rose picking&amp;quot; event is interpreted anaphorically
with respect to the &amp;quot;flower shop&amp;quot; event - requires a second
heuristic, which I will call an Embedded Discourse
Heuristic. This will be EDH-1, since I will introduce
another Embedded Discourse Heuristic a bit later.
If ETN is different from RTN.TF, treat utterance N as
the beginning of an embedded narrative, reassign ETN
to TF (stacking the previous value of TF, for possible
resumption later) and try to interpret RTN.1 against this
new TF.
By this heuristic winning the plausibility stakes against the
FMH, TF is reassigned to ET2 (stacking the previous TF,
which is sited at RT2=RT1=ET1), and RT3 is anaphorically
interpreted as following this new TF. As before, ET3 is
sited directly at RT3 (since simple past), so the &amp;quot;picking
out the roses&amp;quot; event is viewed as immediately following
the &amp;quot;stopping at the florist&amp;quot; event. This is shown roughly in

Using this heuristic, the previously stacked TF (sited at
RT2.RT1.ET1 - the &amp;quot;going to Mary&apos;s house&amp;quot; event)
becomes the new TF, and RT4 is interpreted as directly
following it. Since clause 7c-4 is simple past, the &amp;quot;failing&amp;quot;
event is again correctly interpreted as immediately
following the &apos;going over to Mary&apos;s house&amp;quot; event This is
shown roughly in Figure 3-5.

I have already noted that, like a definite NP, tense can
cause the listener to create a new node in eis structure to
site its AT. What I want to consider here is the
circumstances under which a reader is likely to create a
new node of e/s structure to interpret RTN.i, rather than
using an existing node (i.e., the current TF, one associated
with the previous event (if not the TF) or a previous,
stacked TF).
One circumstance I mentioned earlier was at the
beginning of a discourse: a reader will take an
introductory sentence like Snoopy&apos;s famous first line
It was a dark and stormy night.
and start building up a new e/s structure with one node
corresponding to ST and another node siting AT and ET.
Generalizing this situation to the beginning of embedded
narratives as well, I propose a second Embedded
Discourse Heuristic (EDH-2):
If clause I■1+1 is interpreted as beginning an
embedded narrative, create a new node of e/s
structure and assign it to be TF. Stack the previous
value of TF, for possible resumption later.
EDH-2 differs from EDH-1 in being keyed by the new
clause itself: there is no existing event node of e/s
structure, different from the current IF, which the
embedded narrative is taken to further describe.
EDH-2 explains what is happening in interpreting the
third clause of Example 4. Even though all the clauses of
Example 4 are simple past, with ET-RT, the third clause is
most plausibly interpreted as describing an event which
has occured prior to the &amp;quot;telling about her brother&amp;quot; event.
EDH-2 provides the means of interpreting the tense in an
embedded narrative whose events may occur either
before or even after the current IF.
Example 4
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9933942">
1. I was at Mary&apos;s house yesterday.
2. We talked about her brother.
3. He spent 5 weeks in Alaska with two friends.
4. Together, they made a successful assault on Denali.
5. Mary was very proud of him.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.984719894736842">
Notice that the focus stacking specified in EDH-2 enables
the correct interpretation of clause 4-5, which is most
plausibly interpreted via the FAH as following the &amp;quot;telling
about her brother&amp;quot; event.
EDH-2 is also relevant for the interpretation of NPs
headed by de-verbal nouns (such as &amp;quot;trip&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;installation&amp;quot;,
etc.). While such a NP may describe an event or situation,
there may not be enough information in the NP itself or in
its clause to locate the event or situation in e/s structure
(cf. &apos;my trip to Alaska&amp;quot; versus &amp;quot;my recent/upcoming trip to
Alaska&amp;quot;). On the other hand, EDH-2 provides a way of
allowing that information to come from the subsequent
discourse. That is, if the following clause or NP can be
interpreted as describing a particular event/situation, the
original NP and the subsequent NP or clause can be taken
as co-specifying the same thing. Roughly, that is how I
propose treating cases such as the following variation of
Example 4:
Example 8
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.94216425">
1. I was talking with Mary yesterday.
2. She told me about her trip to Alaska.
3. She spent five weeks there with two friends,
and the three of them climbed Denali.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9589455">
The NP &amp;quot;her trip to Alaska&amp;quot; does not of itself cause an
addition to e/s structure.12 Rather, application of EDH-2
to the interpretation of clause 5-3 results in the creation of
a new node of e/s structure against which its RT is sited.
Other reasoning results in clause 3 and &amp;quot;her trip to Alaska&amp;quot;
being taken as co-specifying the same event. This is what
binds them together and associates &amp;quot;her trip to Alaska&amp;quot;
with a node of e/s structure.
Finally, notice that there will be an ambiguity when
more than heuristic makes a plausible prediction, as in the
following example:
Example 9
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.6621615">
1. I told Frank about my meeting with Ira.
2. We talked about ordering a butterfly.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998278777777778">
It is plausible to take the second utterance as the
beginning of an embedded narrative, whereby EDH-2
results in the &amp;quot;talking about&amp;quot; event being interpreted
against a new node of e/s structure, situated prior to the
&amp;quot;telling Frank&amp;quot; event. (In this case, &amp;quot;we&amp;quot; is Ira and me.) It is
also plausible to take the second utterance as continuing
the current narrative, whereby RAH results in the &amp;quot;talking
about&amp;quot; event being interpreted with respect to the &amp;quot;telling
Frank&amp;quot; event. (In contrast here, &amp;quot;we&amp;quot; is Frank and me.)
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.914121333333333">
12It does, of course, result in the creation of a discourse entity (19]. The
relationship I see between the listener&apos;s eis structure and his/her
discourse model is discussed in (21].

<bodyText confidence="0.981424296296296">
So far I have only shown that clauses containing no
other time-related constructs than tense can be interpreted
anaphorically against more than one site in e/s structure.
Now I want to show, at least by example, that what I have
proposed holds for clauses containing relative temporal
adverbs as well. Relative temporal adverbials must be
interpreted with respect to some other time [18]. So
consider the italicized forms in the following brief texts.
John became the captain of Penn&apos;s squash team.
He was previously captain of the Haverford team.
John left for London on Sunday.
Tuesday he went to Cambridge.
Tuesday John went to Cambridge.
On Sunday, he left for London.
Previously is interpreted with respect to the previously
mentioned &amp;quot;becoming captain&amp;quot; event: it was before that
that he was captain at Haverford. In the second case, the
adverbial On Sunday, given no previous link in the
discourse, is interpreted with respect to ST. However,
Tuesday is then interpreted with respect to the event of
John&apos;s leaving for London: it is interpreted as the Tuesday
after that event. The third case is the reverse.
What I want to show is that, as before, the same four
heuristics predict the sites in e/s structure that may
provide a context for a relative temporal adverbial.
Consider the following.
Example 10a
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.797418454545454">
1. John went over to Mary&apos;s house.
2. On the way, he had stopped by the flower shop for

3. After five minutes of awkwardness, he gave her
the flowers
Example 10b
1. John went over to Mary&apos;s house.
2. On the way, he had stopped by the flower shop for
some roses.
3. After 20 minutes of waiting, he left with the bouquet
and fairly ran to Mary&apos;s.

<bodyText confidence="0.999852071428571">
I will use ADV to refer to the interpretation of the &amp;quot;after&amp;quot;
adverbial. In these cases, what is sited by TF is the
beginning of the interval. What in turn sites the AT of the
main clause is the end of the interval.
The processing of the first two clauses is just the same
as in examples 7a and b. From here, the two examples
diverge.
In 10a-3, the beginning of ADV is most plausibly
interpreted with respect to the IF. The end of ADV in turn
provides an anaphoric interpretation point for RT3. Since
ET3 is interpreted as coincident with RT3 (clause 3 being
simple past), the &amp;quot;rose giving&amp;quot; event is interpreted as
immediately following John&apos;s getting to Mary&apos;s house. This
is shown roughly in figure 4-1.

In 10b-3, the interpretation due to FMH is less
plausible than that due to EDH-1. EDH-1 re-assigns TF to
ET2, where the beginning of ADV is then sited. The end of
ADV in turn provides an anaphoric interpretation point for
RT3. Since ET3 is sited at RT3, the &amp;quot;leaving with the
bouquet&amp;quot; event is sited at the end of the twenty minutes of
waiting. This is shown roughly in Figure 4-2.

An interesting question to consider is whether a
speaker would ever shift the TF as modelled by the FAH
or the EDH-2, while simultaneously using a relative
temporal adverbial whose interpretation would have to be
linked to the new TF, as in example 11 (movement via
FAH) and example 12 (movement via EDH-2).

I find both examples a bit awkward, but nevertheless
understandable. Accounting for TF movement in each of
them is straightforward. However, whether to attribute the
awkwardness of these examples to exceeding people&apos;s
processing capabilities or to a problem with the theory is
grist for further study.

In this paper, I have given what I believe to be a
credible account of the role that tense plays in the
listener&apos;s reconstruction of the events and situations a
speaker has chosen to describe. I have provided support
for several new ideas: (a) that tense is better viewed by
analogy with definite NPs than with pronouns; (b) that a
narrative has a temporal focus that grounds the context-
dependency of tense; and (c) that focus management
heuristics can be used to track the movement of temporal
focus. I have also identified a host of problems that require
further work, including (1) how to incorporate aspectual
interpretation into the model, (2) how to evaluate &apos;strong
associations&apos; between events and/or situations and (3)
how to judge plausibility.

At any point N in the discourse, there is one node of e/s structure that provides a context for the interpretation of the AT of the next clause. I will call it the temporal focus or TF. There are three possibilities: (1) the AT of the next clause will be interpreted anaphorically against the current TF, (2) the TF will shift to a different node of eis structure.- either one already in the structure or one created in recognition of an embedded narrative - and the AT interpreted with respect to that node, or (3) the TF will return to the node previously labelled TF, after completing an embedded narrative, as in (2), and the AT interpreted there. These three behaviors are described by four focus management heuristics described in this section: a Focus Maintenance Heuristic, two Embedded Discourse Heuristics and a Focus Resumption Heuristic.9 In (21), I presented a control structure in which these heuristics were applied serially. The next heuristic would only be applied when the prediction of the previous one was rejected on grounds of &amp;quot;semantic or pragmatic inconsistency&amp;quot;.

For example, it is not impossible for a cat to own a telescope - e.g., by inheritance from its former owner. Thus &amp;quot;a cat with a telescope&apos; is not an inconsistent description. However, it must compete with other plausible interpretations like &amp;quot;seeing with a telescope&amp;quot; in &amp;quot;I saw a cat with a telescope&apos;. be gained by pushing the analogy between tense and definite NPs.

In contrast, I discuss what I believe to be a more productive analogy between tense and definite noun phrases. Previous work has focussed on the interpretation of tensed clauses in simple linear narratives (i.e., narratives in which the order of underlying events directly corresponds to their order of presentation).3 Here the most perplexing question involves when the next clause in a sequence is interpreted as an event or sequence coincident with the previous one and when, as following the previous one [4, 6, 12]. In Section 3, I show that if one moves beyond simple linear narratives, there are more options. In terms of the framework proposed here, there may be more than one position in the evolving e/s structure which can provide a context for the interpretation of tense. Hence there may be more than one position in e/s structure which tense can specify and which the new event or situation can attach to. To model the possible contexts, I introduce a discourse-level focussing mechanism - temporal focus or TF - similar to that proposed for interpreting pronouns and definite NPs [17]. I give examples to</context>

A new node would be created in e/s structure ordered sometime after the &amp;quot;reaching the Stadium&amp;quot; event. On the other hand, with the &amp;quot;when&amp;quot; clause, that new node can be ordered more precisely after the &amp;quot;reaching the Stadium&amp;quot; event. By association with its &amp;quot;antecedent&amp;quot; (the &amp;quot;travelling to the appointment&amp;quot; event), it can be ordered after the achievement of that event. There is another advantage to be gained by pushing further the analogy between tense and definite NPs that relates to the problem tackled in [6, 4, 12] of how to reconcile the anaphoric nature of tense with the fact that the event or situation described in the next clause varies as to whether it is taken to be coincident with, during, before or after the event or situation described in the previous clause. This I will discuss in the next section, after introducing the notion of temporal focus. °except for &amp;quot;pronouns of laziness&amp;quot; which can evoke and specify new entities through the use of previous descriptions 149 3.

One answer to this question appears in two separate papers in this volume [8, 131, each ascribing a tripartite structure to the way we view and talk about events. This structure consists of a preparatory phase, a culmination, and a consequence phase, to use the terminology of [8]. (Such a structure is proposed, in part, to give a uniform account of how the interpretation of temporal adverbials interacts with the interpretation of tense and aspect.) Nodes in eis structure correspond to events and situations, as the speaker conceives them. If one associates such a structure with the node labelled the current TF, then one can say that &apos;strongly&apos; associated with it are events and situations that could make up its preparatory phase, culmination or consequence phase.

Having said that it is the AT of tense whose interpretation is anaphoric, the next question to ask is what kind of anaphoric behavior it evinces.

Now I want to show, at least by example, that what I have proposed holds for clauses containing relative temporal adverbs as well. Relative temporal adverbials must be interpreted with respect to some other time [18]. So consider the italicized forms in the following brief texts.

These three behaviors are described by four focus management heuristics described in this section: a Focus Maintenance Heuristic, two Embedded Discourse Heuristics and a Focus Resumption Heuristic.9 In (21), I presented a control structure in which these heuristics were applied serially. The next heuristic would only be applied when the prediction of the previous one was rejected on grounds of &amp;quot;semantic or pragmatic inconsistency&amp;quot;. I now believe this is an unworkable hypothesis. Maintaining it requires (1) identifying grounds for such rejection and (2) arguing that one can reject proposals, independent of knowing the alternatives. I now don&apos;t believe that either can be done. It is rarely the case that one cannot come up with a story linking two events and/or situations. Thus it would be impossib</context>
