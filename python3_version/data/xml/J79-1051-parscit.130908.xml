The idea of attaching a modifier to its nearest potential
modificand is often stated as a reasonable heuristic in natu-
ral language parsing. (This is essentially Kimball&apos;s Princi-
ple Number To*, &amp;quot;Terminal symbols optimally associate to the
lowest nonterminal node.&amp;quot; Although Kimball calls this prin-
ciple &amp;quot;right association&amp;quot; and illustrates it with right-
branching examples, it can apply equally well to left-branching
structures.)
In the sentence, &amp;quot;Are those invoices produced from the
ordexa processed by the system in New York?&amp;quot;, the preposi-
tional phrase &amp;quot;in New York&amp;quot; could potentially modify &amp;quot;system&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;processed&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;orders&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;produced&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;invoices&amp;quot;, both syntac-
tically and semantically. Similarly, &amp;quot;by the system&amp;quot; has four
possibilities and &amp;quot;processed&amp;quot; has two. According to the
heuristic stated above, the preferred analysis is: &amp;quot;in New
York&amp;quot; modifies &amp;quot;system&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;by the system...&amp;quot; modifies &amp;quot;pro-
cessed&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;processed...&amp;quot; modifies &amp;quot;orders&amp;quot;.
A &amp;quot;potential modificand&amp;quot; must be acceptable pragmatically
as well as syntactically and semantically. This means that

Similarly, dialogue context can have an influence on what
qualifies as a potential modificand.
This paper describes an eaoily computed metric that in-
volves attaching a number to each syntactic unit as it is
formed, to rank the possible analyses for any portion of an

technique is illustrated by its use in a system which supports
a.. natural language dialogue for automatic business programming

text to understand user utterances.

Median split (MS) trees are a new technique for searching
sets of keys with highly skewed frequency distributions (such
as the lexemes of a natural language). The basic idea is to
modfty frequency ordered binary search (FOBS) trees to con-
tain two key values--a node value which identifies the key
which resides at that node (as in a conventional binary search
tree), and a split value which gives the largest key value to
be found in the left subtree. (If the keys are expensive to
store in the tree nodes, or costly to compare, they may be
hashed into integers without affecting the algorithm.)
Searching an MS tree proceeds as in a binary tree except that
the decision to go left or right from a node whose node value
does not match the current key is made by comparing the cur-
rent key to the split, rather than to the node, value. The
use of two different values allows one to prevent the search
tree from being unbalanced as FOBS trees become when a high
frequency key has an. extreme key value. In fact, by selecting
the median of the key values of a node&apos;s descendants as its
slalit value, one can force the search tree to be perfectly
balanced--which both allows a highly space efficient repre-
sentation of the tree, and achieves high speed search.
14th ACL Meeting 8
The average cost per search in an MS tree, like a FOBS
tree, depend t on both the frequency distribution of the keys,
and the ordering relation on them. Performance analyses for
specific frequency distributions and key orderings of interest
are presented, and it is shown that, unlike FOBS trees, MS
tree search time is log n bounded and is very stable around a
value that can be shown to be optimal for any binary tree
search procedure. Furthermore, in addition to being substan-
tially faster than &amp;quot;optimum&amp;quot; binary tree search, an MS tree
can be build for a given ordering relation and set of frequen-
cies in time n log n, as opposed to n2
A discussion of the application of MS trees to dictionary
lookup for English is presented, and the performance obtained.
is contrasted with hash and trie solutions.

TRANSLATING &apos;WELL-WRITTEN&apos; ALGORITHM DESCRIPTIONS INTO CODE

In this paper we describe a system for the semantic ana-
lysis of &amp;quot;well-written&amp;quot; algorithm descriptions in English,

such as one finds in Knuth (3), and the translation of the
resulting structures into a program in a higher-level pro-
gramming language, such as PL/I. There axe two approaches
one miight take toward the sublanguage of algorithm descrip-
tions. One may treat the English as a deviant programming
language and try to smooth out the deviations. Or one may
view the English as a well-behaved, highly regular form of
natural language, and apply to the text the sophisticated
techniques of analysis that have been developed for less
tractable sorts of texts. We have taken the latter approach,
Semantic analysis is done by a system that has been de-
veloped for and is being tested on a variety of natural
language texts (1). It takes as input the text in a predicate
calculus-like notation produced by a syntactic front end (4,
2). It applies semantic operations which access a data base
of &amp;quot;world knowledge&amp;quot; inferences that are drawn selectively,
depending on context and in response to the operations. The
operations are described below with examples that show their
importance in analyzing algorithm descriptions:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.693946">
1. Predicate interpretation: Inferences are sought to
satisfy the demands predicates make on the nature of their

arguments.. Among other things, this operation recovers omitted
material, for example when the whole is used to refer to the
part. In
&amp;quot;T points to a binary tree&apos;
the predicate &amp;quot;point&amp;quot; requires its second argument to be a
node. The knowledge stored in the data base about binary
trees is searched for a dominant node, the root node is found,
and the sentence becomes
&amp;quot;T points to the root node of a binary tree.&amp;quot;
2. Intersentence relations are determined by matching
successive sentences against a small number of patterns.
These patterns are stated in terms of inferences to be drawn
from the current sentence and a previous sentence. An
ordered heuristic search of the data base is used to locate
the desired inferences. Intersentence relations are especially
important in algorithm descriptions, for they determine the
flow of control in the program. The most common and easily
handled patterns in these texts are Temporal Succession,
cause, and Enablement. They are translated into successive
lines of code.
But also important is the Contrast pattern: &amp;quot;The predi-
cates of sentences S1 and S are the same. One air of
2 p cor-
responding arguments are contradictory. The other pair are
different but similar.&amp;quot; Consider
&amp;quot;If VAL(M) VAL(N), set N equal to LINK(N).
If VAL(M) &lt; VAL(N, set M equal to LINK(M).&amp;quot;
14th ACL Meeting 11
It is intended that these translate not into successive in-
Structions, but into a case statement. This is keyed by the
Contrast pattern. (The top-level predicate is &amp;quot;imply&amp;quot;.)
Similarly, consider the sentences

<listItem confidence="0.989765090909091">
(1) &amp;quot;Decrease N by 1. and if it is zero, reset it to MAX.&amp;quot;
(2) &amp;quot;Decrease N by 1, but if it is zero, reset it to MAX.&amp;quot;
In (1) the test for zero comes after decreasing N, in (2)
before. This is because in (2), &amp;quot;but&amp;quot; invokes the Contrast
pattern, forcing us to recover the implicit &amp;quot;If N is not zero&amp;quot;
before &amp;quot;Decrease&amp;quot;. (2) is translated into a case statement.

This frequently resolves anaphora as a byproduct.
4. Resolving anaphora: Antecedents not round by knitting
are searched for by trying to maximize the redundancy of the
text. In

&amp;quot;N&amp;quot; is chosen over &amp;quot;J&amp;quot; as the antecedeut of &amp;quot;it&amp;quot; since it is
N whose value is subject to change.
5. Search for Primitives: Certain predicates are &amp;quot;pri-
mitive&amp;quot; VD this application, i.e the task component has
substitution rules for them. Where possible, a decomposition
of the text in terms of these primitives is looked for. For
instance, a tree is, in part, a set of nodes, a node is a set
of fields, and a field may be a number. &amp;quot;Set&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;number&amp;quot;
are primitives. To decrease N by 1 is to cause N to be equal
to one less than before, and &amp;quot;cause to be equal to&amp;quot; is a
primitive.

GENERATING NATURALS LANGUAGE EXPLANATIONS OF COMPUTER PROGRAMS

<bodyText confidence="0.995387688888889">
An automatic programming system that converses with a user
in a natural language must be able to generate explanations of
portions of the program being produced. In the system that we
are developing for producing customized business application
programs, these explanations. must be given in application terms
rather than program terms. For example. the system might say,
&amp;quot;The quantity shipped is the lesser of the quantity ordered and
the quantity available,&amp;quot; rapther than &amp;quot;QS=MIN(Q0,QA)&amp;quot;.
One could certainly imagine generating such sentences by
having an inventory of sentence patterns and name phrases and
using a fill-in-the-blanks approach. However, in addition to
not being very interesting, such an approach would certainly
not provide the same flexibility of expression that a more lin-
guittically motivated approach would. Also, it seems reasonable
to do this generation by utilizing information that, the system
already has for understanding the user&apos;s English utterances.
In our system, information is stored in the form of a se-
mantic network with three parts. The program part contains
information about the programming language and about a specific
program; the application part contains information about business
concepts; and the language part contains information about English
words. Each of these parts has its own internal structure, and
there are links between the parts where appropriate. For example,
14th ACL Meeting 14
within the application part the node for the concept QUANSHIPD
has a SUPerset arc to QUANT and a KIND arc to SHP. Between
parts of the network, QUANSHIPD is linked as the RAO (Related
Application Object) arc of the program node QS, the language
node QUANTIT (the stem of &amp;quot;quantity&amp;quot;) is linked as the RLO
(Related Language Object) of QUANT, and the language node SHIP
is the RLO of SHP. In general, the links between adjacent
parts are many-to-many.
The linguistic processing in our system is specified by
augmented phrase structure rules, uniformly for the three
levels of processing: semantic, syntactic, and morphological.
Given a pointer to a node in the program part, alQng with some
information about what aspect of that node is to be explained,
these rules can generate an appropriate English statement by
utilizing the structure of the network. Because these state-
ments are constructed from very small pieces (i.e. word stems)
considerable flexibility of expression is possible, including
taking into account dialogue context.
This paper will describe in some detail the overall
method of generation, with special emphasis on complex definite
noun phrases.

THE SEMANTIC INTERPRETATION OF MASS NOUN EXPRESSIONS

A large number of the most commonly used, English nouns
belongs to the category of mass nouns. In recent years it
has become increasingly clear that the semantic analysis of
expressions containing mass nouns encounters great difficulties.
because of the uncertain logical status of mass noun referents.
This uncertainty is reflected in the appearance of a variety
of vague terms, such as &amp;quot;substance&amp;quot;, &apos;quantity&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;matter&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;bits&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;pieces&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;stuff&amp;quot;, etc. in recent literature on the
subject (see Pelletier 1975). It is indeed fair to say that.
&amp;quot;the logic of mass expressions ... at present is grossly
underdeveloped&amp;quot; (McCawley 1975)
Work in computational linguistics so far has not contri-
buted to a solution or even a better understanding of the.
problems that mass nouns pose. In language understanding sys-
tems that have been developed in the past few years these
problems have been evaded, either by restricting the admitted
use of mass nouns trivially, as in the SHRDLU dialogue system
(Winograd 1972), or by explicitly excluding their use altoge-
ther, as in the LSNLIS question answering system (Woods 1972).
The recently implemented question answering system
PHLIQA 1 (Laiadsbergen 1976, Medema et al. 1975, Scha 1976)
may be considered as a supsuantial step forward in this
14th ACL Meeting 16
respect. This system performs the semantic analysis of com-
plex mass noun expressions, including quantifying phrases,
adjectives, amount expressions, etc. The analysis is based
on a theory, in which a central role is played by a logical
formalism, developed for the semantic representation of mass
expressions. These representations were required to meet the
following conditions:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.7373">
1. They should be in agreement with the ontological commit-
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.880668818181818">
ments of mass noun uses. In our view, the typical use of a
mass noun indicates that the noun referent is viewed as a
continuum; i.e. no articulation of the referent into individual
elements is taken into consideration--which is of course not to
say that the referent actually is a continuum.
2. They should bring the logical properties of mass expression
to the light, e.g. rendering analytic sentences tautologically
true.
The paper develops this semantic theory of mass noun expres-
sions, and describes its incorporation in the semantic analysis
performed-by the PHLIQA 1 system.

A central prtblem for computational models of understand-
ing is to formalize the meanings of words which are manipulated
by the model. This paper reports on research directed towards
the formalization of the meanings of nouns. The goal of the
research is to de6cribe nouns sufficiently to enable the per-
formance of a particular task of understanding: the appropriate
selection of verb senses for multiply-sensed verbs.
The hypothesis being tested is that noun meaning can be
described by primitive &amp;quot;units of meaning,&amp;quot; here called features.
The concepts of semantic features and componential analysis are.
familiar; the contributions of this work are the development of
empirical methods of analysis and the generation of a general
set of features.
The effect of noun meaning on the sense of a verb can be
clearly seen by examining simple sentences with identical syn-
tactic structure and no extra-sentential context. TO study
noun meaning in a regular, non-subjective fashion, a large
number of simple sentences of the form noun-verb-noun have
been generated. In groups of the sentences, the subject noun
and verb have been fixed, while the object noun is varied.
The variance in the object noun causes the verb to have diffe-
rent readings, or different mappings of the lexical verb onto
one of its senses.
14th ACL Meeting 19
From that group of nouns, in the object position, which
cause the selection of the same sense for the verb in question,
the common thread of meaning is extracted and posited as a
semantic feature descriptive of that group of nouns. Repeti-
tion of this process for various verbs and nouns yields a set
of semantic features. These features are considered as for-
malizing noun meaning at least for purposes of verb sense
selection.
The major problems in the above approach are 1) the inevi-
table intrusion of subjectivity into the feature extraction
task and 2) the lack of generality of the feature set beyond
the particular group of nouns and verbs studied. Several
methods have been used to control subjectivity: repetition of
the process using the same verbs with different nouns and vice-
versa, and the generation of features from the regular study
of other tasks of understanding which involve nouns--noun-
adjunct:noun pairs (e.g. school house) and noun analogies. To
ensure as much generality as possible, the words considered in
the study have been chosen from the set of (statistically) most
common English words and do not comprise any unified semantic
field.
Results have been interesting and encouraging. In addi-

of evaluation. This panel will address the topic of evaluation,
emphasizing the evaluation of performance: The panelists will
consider such questions as: What measures are used to evaluate
a system? How sensitive is performance to vocabulary size and
scope of syntax? What alternatives can be studied analytically
or experimentally?
Performance can be considered absolutely (how effective is
a syatem, with respect to resources and goals?), relative to
problem variation (how would it respond to changes in, e.g.,
vocabulary size). relative to system variation, and relative to
other systems. In each case both the results of evaluation of
particular systems and procedures of evaluation are of interest.
The panel will consist of experts, all of whom have written
large systems. These systems include speech systems and text
systems, business-oriented question-answering systems and
artificial intelligence systems, and systems with contrasting
linguistic theories.

RESEARCH METHODS FOR MODELING DIALOGUE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9639578125">
When people communicate with machines, they do so by spe-
cializing and extending their existing ability to communicate.
To design systems which interact effectively with humans, we
need to better understand how people communicate with each other.
In particular, we need to view human communication as a
problem-solving activity, in which the people so engaged are
using language as a method to achieve certain of their goals.
The existing research into natural language has not focused
on this aspect, so from our point of view the work so far has
been fragmentary and hard to use, particularly in terms of
helping to enhance man-machine comm-nication.
Constructing a useful model of human communication is an
extremely complex task. We view the controlling of this com-
plexity (without sacrificing utility) as the central problem
in designing our research approach. In response to this chal-
lenge, our research methodology contains some innovations,
specifically intended to maintain control on the complexity,
while retaining the usefulness of our results for designers
of man/machine communication systems.
14th ACL Meeting 23
Specifically, these innovations include
--Case analysis, rather than functional design.
--Independent judgment of the adequacy of the model.
--Results in the form of individual algorithms, not
full systems.
--Algorithms which are transferable into nonresearch
systems.
We describe a research methodology, and the resulting
Dialogue Modeling System which incorporates these innovations.
The methodology analyzes naturally-occurring dialogues rather
than prepared examples. For each dialogue we choose to ana-
lyze, a separate model is constructed. Each model is judged
against annotations of the dialogue prepared by a trained ob-
server who uses a predefined set of categories of phenomena.
Although the processes employed in each model are to be
as general as we find practical, they may also be as ad-hoc as
necessary to make the model work. After several models have
been produced in this fashion, we expect to find that, although
many processes have been too idiosyncratic to be used in more
than one model, many others have seen repeated application and
thus have demonstrated their more general utility. These pro-
cesses are regarded as the principal results, since they have
been verified against a diversity of observers&apos; annotations.
Subsequent speakers will provide details on the memory
organization of the model, the processors which operate on these
memories, and the issues raised by the inclusion of the observer
in the model development cycle.

KNOWLEDGE STRUCTURES FOR MODELING DIALOGUE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.97022335483871">
This paper describes the knowledge structures developed
for our Dialogue Modeling System. Permanent knowledge is
stored as Concepts in a semantic neEwork Long Term Memory (LTM),
using a predicate/parameter representational format Concepts
that are currently salient to the Processors of the System are
represented by tokens of those concepts, called Activations,
in the Workspace (WS). Activations are transient entities,
with new ones frequently appearing and existing ones changing
or disappearing, The WS at any moment forms the current con-
text, which drives current processing. All Processors inter-
communicate through the WS, modifying the set of Activations
and being influenced by them. The WS simplifies the integra.
tion of multiple sources of information about any given entity
Two kinds of higher level knowledge structures are used
to model dialogues. There are Execution Scenes, representing
organized clusters of actions and/or objects being discussed
in the dialogue These are similar to the other currently
proposed higher level units, like &amp;quot;scripts&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;frames&amp;quot;.
There are also higher level units called Dialogue-games, spe-
cifications concerning the topic of discussion, the partici-
pants, the goals they are trying to achieve with a given type
of dialogue, and a set of conventional subgoals for mutually
achieving their goals.
14th ACL Meeting 25
In our analysis of naturally occurring dialogues, we have,
found many different kinds of Dialogue-games, including Helping,
Smalltalk, Gripe, Polite-conversation, Order, Information-
seeking, and Information-probing. An analysis of fourteen
helping dialogues uncovered a surprising amount of consistency
in the structure of these interactions, which is captured in
the representation of the Helping Dialogue-gams.

PROCESSORS FOR MODEONG DIALOGUE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992229205128205">
This paper provides details of the major Processors incor-
porated into our Dialogue Modeling System. These Processors
are independent and asynchronous, monitoring the activity in
the Workspace, and modifying it as appropriate,
PROTEUS PROCESSOR -- Every activation in the Workspace
has a &amp;quot;level of activation&amp;quot; (a number) which corresponds to
its degree of salience to the model&apos;s current activity. Each
of these activattons imparts some of its salience to its imme-
diate neighbors (including those in Long Term Memory). Simi-
larly, the activation level of each node is augmented by that
imparted to it by all of its neighbors. Whenever a concept in
LTM accumulates activation above a certain threshold, an acti-
vation of that concept is created in the Workspace, Thus, if
enough concepts, closely rblated to X are active, X will also
became active. Proteus is the Processor which attends to all
of this, thus providing a mechanism for bringing a concept into
attention, based on the attention directed toward related concepts.
14th ACL Meeting 26
MATCH PROCESSOR -- This identifies concepts in LTM that
are congruent to existing.activations in the WS The Dialogue
Modelling System contains a number of equivalence-like rela-
tions. which Match uses to identify a concept in LTM as repre-
senting the same, thing as an activation of some seemingly-
different concept Once such an equivalent concept is found, it
is activated. Match thus provides the same sort of attention
direction that Proteus does, except that Proteus is driven by
the explicit connectivity of the memory, while Match responds
to more indirectly-represented similarities.
DEDUCE PROCESSOR -- This attempts to apply a rule, whenever
that rule has become. active. Rules are concepts of the form.
&amp;quot;(Condition)-&gt;(Action)&amp;quot;. They become active by virtue of the
activity of the concept which is their condition half. Deduce
senses the activity of a rule and attempts to apply it by acti-
vating the concept for the action. Whatever correspondences
were evolved in the course of creating the activation of the
condition (left) half of the rule are carried over into the
activation of the action (right) half. The combination of
Match and Deduce gives us all the capability of a production
system, where the system is represented by all the Rules in LTM.

A PROCESS MODEL FOR SPEECH ACT UNDERSTANDING
ALLEN MUNRO
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO
In a conversation, hearers must make judgments about the
intention of a speaker&apos;s utterance. A restaurant waiter rea-
lizes that when a patron says, &amp;quot;Waiter, this soup is cold,&amp;quot; he
is not merely thereby making an assertion, but is also making
a complaint, and perhaps requesting rectlification.

tion. Two types of intentions are described in this paper,
both of which depend largely on contextual factors for their
recognition or understanding in a dialogue situation. Those
of the first type (type A) are broadly applicable to many
discourse situations and are understood primarily on the basis
of the syntactic structure of utterances and certain facts
about the status relationships that hold between the speaker
and the hearer. Type A intentions are very similar to the

<bodyText confidence="0.985091095238095">
of the second type (type B) are much more dependent on the
nature of the particular contextual situation. They.are
recognized or understood on the basis of shared cultural norms
concerning the particular kind of conversation the participants
are engaged in. Type B speech acts are much less general in
nature than type A. If a salesman says, &amp;quot;This little two-tone
model has been priced to sell,&amp;quot; then the customer should recog-
nize that the type A intention is to make an assertion or a
claim, and that the type B intention is to offer an item for sale.
14th ACL Meeting 31
A prdcessing model for speech act recognition or under-
standing is presented, in wbich procedures called speech act
schemata are activated. In the example with the salesman, the
customer should have experienced the activation of both an
assertion schema and a sales-offer schema The schemata are
formulated in SOL, the high level language of the LNR memory
model (Norman, Rumelhart, and LNR), which permits the modeling
of conceptual entities which have both structural and proce-
dural properties. In addition, the type B speech act schemata
are subprocedures of larger information organizers which are
sensitive to the particular context. These larger devices

NATURAL LANGUAGE UNDERSTANDING BY COGNITIVE NETWORKS

<bodyText confidence="0.972900333333333">
A model of human cognition which stores and utilizes lin-
guistic knowledge in the same structures as &apos;general&apos; or &apos;world&apos;
knowledge supports an efficient and tntuitively satisfying
technique for the understanding of natural language. Cognitive
comprehension and syntactic parsing can proceed in parallel,
cooperatively, using the same procedures, without the loss of
the syntax/semantics distinction.
In this paper, a system whfch uses such a representation
is described. The representation is a cognitive network, a
directed graph model of human cognition. The grammatical
knowledge it contains is shown to be similar in structure to
an augmented recursive transition network, but the understanding
process is not ubilt around an ATN parser. Instead a &amp;quot;syntac-
tically aided comprehension&amp;quot; procedure is used; cognitive
processes, taking advantage of the uniform representation of
knowledge, utilize linguistic knowledge as is required, for
tasks such as the disambiguation of conceptual relationships,
and the location, in the network, of referents designated by
phrases instead of names. Although the system has the syntactic
knowledge needed to produce a correct pars t for an utterance,
it does not always have to apply it.
A few brief comparisons with other natural language
understanding techniques will be included.

<bodyText confidence="0.901682">
A system for representing and using knowledge of cause
and effect, called Commonsense Algorithms (CSA), will be de-
scribed. The CSA project, ongoing for about a year now, has
as its goal the unification of current ideas about problem
solving with current ideas about contextual language compre-
hension. To this end, the CSA project currently consists of
three parts, all built on top of the declarative CSA repre-
sentation formalism: (1) a plan synthesizer, (2) a sentence-
in-context interpreter (designed as the 2-sentence case of
at eventnal n-sentence story comprehender), and (3) a mecha-
nism description &amp;quot;laboratory&apos;, whose purpose is to provide a
framework or describing the &amp;quot;causal topology&amp;quot; of man-made
devices and mechanisms. The LISP system which implements the
CSA theory incorporates processes which are demon-like and
processes which are more planful, and the CSA theory identi-
fies haw and. why the planner and the population of demons
interact. The presentation will cover the organization and
access techniques for large numbers of CSA causal patterns in
these two-modes (planful and demohic), drawing on scenarios
which illustrate the level of sophistication of the current

A HEURISTIC SEARCH APPROACH TO DISCOURSE ANALYSIS
JERRY R. HOBBS
CITY COLLEGE OF CUNY
</note>
<bodyText confidence="0.983844875">
This paper describes a computational approach to the
problems of discourse structure of real-world English para-
graphs, using the techniques of heuristic search, Procedures
for detecting intersentence relations are being developed
within the framework of a system for semantic analysis of,
English texts (1). This system takes as input the text in a
predicate calculus-like notation produced by a syntactic
front end (3, 2). Various semantic operations are applied:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.955817">
1) Inferences are sought to satisfy the demants made by
predicates on the nature of their arguments (predicate inter-
pretation).
2) Redundancies are recognized and merged (knitting).
3) Anaphora are resolved.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.982054529411765">
The operations work by accessiug a data base of world know-
ledge inferences, which are drawn selectively in response to
the operations, and which carry a measure of their salience
that varies with the context.
Intersentence relations are determined by matching the.
current sentence and the previous text against a small number
of patterns. These patterns are stated in terms of inferences
to be drawn from the current sentence and an &amp;quot;eligible&amp;quot; pre-
vious sentence, and the modification to be performed on the
text if the pattern is matched. The patterns are of two
14th ACL Meeting 36
kinds--coordinating and subordinating. One coordinating
relation is Temporal Succession: &amp;quot;The current sentence
asserts a change whose initial state is implied by an eligible
previous sentence.&amp;quot; Other coordinating relations are Cause,
Contrast, Parallel, and Paraphrase. Two subordinating rela-
tions are
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.736304333333333">
1) Example: &amp;quot;The predicate and arguments of the asser-
tion of the current sentence stand in a subset or element-of
relation to those of the assertion of an eligible previous
sentence.&amp;quot; (See below.)
2) &amp;quot;Relative clause in disguise&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;The current sentence
provides further information about an entity fairly deeply
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.887553884615385">
embedded in an eligible previous sentence.&amp;quot; (E.g. the second
and third sentences of this abstract.) When this pattern is
matched, the modification made to the text is equivalent to,
turning the current sentence into a relative clause.
As analysis proceeds, a tree-like structure is constructed
for the paragraph, with subordinating relations building the
tree downward and coordinating links building it to the right.
A previous sentence is &amp;quot;eligible&amp;quot; if it is on the right fron-
tier of this tree. For example, in a text Si S2 S3, if S2 is
a disguised relative clause on Si, then S3 may be coordinated
with either Si or S2, but if S2 succeeds Si temporally, then
S3 may be coordinated only with S2.
The heart of the operation is an ordered heuristic
search of the data base for desired inferences. These
14th ACL Meeting 37
desired inferences are kept on a goal list, and have strengths
associated with them, The strength of a goal depends on the
type of text and the patterns found previously in the text.
Also, the presence of conjunctions and some other elements
advance certain patterns--&amp;quot;,ind&amp;quot; promotes Temporal Succession
and a repetition of the previously recognized pattern, a dash
and &amp;quot;i.e.&amp;quot; promote Paraphrase, and the articLe &amp;quot;this&amp;quot; fre-
quently signals a disguised relative clause. The evaluation
function which orders the heuristic starch is based on the
trength of the goal, the length of the chain of inference, and
the current salience &apos;of inferences in the chain.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.925188">
When a partial match is found, the difference, or the

remainder of the goal, is placed high on a goal list for
subsequent processing. Consider the text
&amp;quot;Republicans, are discouraged about their prospects
The party chairman is convinced that many GOP congress-
men will lose their bid for reelection.&amp;quot;
Suppose for simplicity &amp;quot;be discouraged&amp;quot; decomposes into
&amp;quot;believe something bad will happen&amp;quot; We have a partial
match with the Example pattern since the second sentence
asserts that a particular Republican believes something.
Hence a principal goal for our processing of the &amp;quot;that&amp;quot;
clause is to show that what is believed is than an event bad
for a Republican will occur. This is shown by accessing the
fact about a political party that one of its purposes is to
win elections.
14th ACL Meeting 38
Goals generated by a partial match are also passed on
to subsequent sentences. In a Newsweek paragraph analyzed,
the first sentence S1 asserts a change. The next three
sentences S2 S3 S4 assert stages along the course of this
change, S2 is matched with the initial state of the change
in Sl, thus generating as a goal the matching of S3 and S4
with succeeding states. Finally, the structure &amp;quot;S2 then S3
then SA&amp;quot; is taken as an Example of Sl.
This work has significance for future attempts to sum-
marize paragraphs automatically. For, instance, in a text
tied together by the Example pattern, the sentence &amp;quot;exampled&amp;quot;
must be a major part of the summary.

CONGRESSMAN QUESTIONS PAYMENT

<bodyText confidence="0.998362111111111">
A supplementary payment of $400,000 on an indexing contract
was criticized on the floor of the House by Congressman Aspin
of Wisconsin. According to the Congressional Record (May 4,
H3909), Aspin said that the payment was made &amp;quot;under the provi-
sions of a special bailout law (Public Law 85-804)&amp;quot; when
Peter Toma &amp;quot;said that he would be &apos;impelled to leave the United
States&apos; without the aid.&amp;quot;
The bailout law, according to Aspin, &amp;quot;should only be used when
the Pentagon really needs equipment that is vital to the national
security.&amp;quot; The Latsec contract was one of several that Aspin
characterized as not qualifying for the supplementary payments.
He called for a new study of the whole concept.
Toma was quoted in newspaper reports as.saying that &amp;quot;If
Contressman-Aspin were to look at our system and what it is
doirla for this country, he would withdraw his criticism.&amp;quot; The
newspaper story describes the basic contract as one with the
Foreign Technology Division-.at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base,
originally worth $460,000 for a three-year period.

There is a widespread myth among linguists that machine
translation--or, properly, machine-aided translation--which
was the object of intense effort and research a decade and a
half ago, was found to be a failure and has since been abandoned.
Nothing, in fact, could be further from the truth.
Although a number of institutions and agencies in the U. S.
and elsewhere undertook extensive efforts in the late 1950s and
early 1960s to develop computer programs for translation, only
one, the Georgetown University program, succeeded in becoming
fully operational (without requiring extensive pre- or post-
editing).. The Georgetown program was the ultimate basis for two
of the major functioning MT programs in the U.S. today, that at
Oak Ridge and at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base._ These and
other programs every year produce thousands of usable scientific
and technical translations. However, they are all built on a
research base which is now nearly twenty years old.
The 1966 report of the Automatic Language Processing Advisory
Committee (ALPAC), which concluded that MT results had not been
fully satisfactory, led to the virtual elimination of government

support for MT research. While the conclusion was not strictly
justified (for example, scientists at Oak Ridge and Euratom, given
choice between human and machine translation, both opted for the
latter), the reduction in funding was timely, since the extant
programs had largely exhausted the then-available possibilities
in computer technology and linguistics.
Unfortunately, much of the money spent on machine transla-
tion projects was applied to theoretical research rather than
being used for translation--which was often disparaged as being
merely practical and lacking in theoretical interest. It is
therefore ironic that had more research been done directly on
translation, the development of linguistic theory itself might
have been accelerated by five to ten years. (Interestingly,
transformational linguists, so often linked with computers in the
public mind, had little involvement with MT.)
In the ten years since the ALPAC report, there has been con-
siderable development in computer technology and in linguistics.
The state of the art has advanced in both fields to the point where
a new synthesis is now possible, which could produce greatly im-
proved translations on a more cost-effective basis. (Unfortunately,
one of the few projects in recent years to try this, at Berkeley,
was curtailed last year for lack of funds.)
The time has now come for a new effort in MT to be under-
taken. Properly conducted, such an effort would not only improve
the quality and efficiency of translation, but would add to our
knowledge of substantive universals and semantics, as well as
THE FUTURE OF MT 49
deepen our understanding of particular languages. MT can make
an important contribution to the building of the information base
on which the growth of linguistic theory must depend, at the same
time that it produces a result of great practical value.

<abstract confidence="0.996870391752578">In this paper we describe a system for the semantic analysis of &amp;quot;well-written&amp;quot; algorithm descriptions in English, such as one finds in Knuth (3), and the translation of the structures into a program in a higher-level prolanguage, such as PL/I. axe two approaches one miight take toward the sublanguage of algorithm descriptions. One may treat the English as a deviant programming and try to smooth out the Or one may view the English as a well-behaved, highly regular form of language, and apply to the text of analysis that have for less of texts. We have taken approach, analysis is done by a has defor is being tested on a variety of natural (1). It as input the text in a predicate calculus-like notation produced by a syntactic front end (4, It applies semantic which access data base &amp;quot;world knowledge&amp;quot; inferences that are drawn context and in response operations. The below with that show in descriptions: 1. Predicate interpretation: Inferences are sought to the demands predicates make on 14th ACL Meeting 10 arguments.. Among other things, this operation recovers omitted material, for example when the whole is used to refer to the part. In &amp;quot;T points to a binary tree&apos; the predicate &amp;quot;point&amp;quot; requires its second argument to be a node. The knowledge stored in the data base about binary trees is searched for a dominant node, the root node is found, and the sentence becomes points to the nodeof a binary tree.&amp;quot; 2. Intersentence relations are determined by matching successive sentences against a small number of patterns. These patterns are stated in terms of inferences to be drawn from the current sentence and a previous sentence. An ordered heuristic search of the data base is used to locate the desired inferences. Intersentence relations are especially important in algorithm descriptions, for they determine the flow of control in the program. The most common and easily handled patterns in these texts are Temporal Succession, cause, and Enablement. They are translated into successive lines of code. also important is the &amp;quot;The prediof sentences S are the same. One air of p corresponding arguments are contradictory. The other pair are different but similar.&amp;quot; Consider &amp;quot;If VAL(M) VAL(N), set N equal to If VAL(M) &lt; VAL(N, set M equal to LINK(M).&amp;quot; 14th ACL Meeting 11 It is intended that these translate not into successive ininto a case statement. This is keyed by the Contrast pattern. (The top-level predicate is &amp;quot;imply&amp;quot;.) Similarly, consider the sentences (1) &amp;quot;Decrease N by 1. and if it is zero, reset it to MAX.&amp;quot; (2) &amp;quot;Decrease N by 1, but if it is zero, reset it to In (1) the test for zero comes after decreasing N, in (2) before. This is because in (2), &amp;quot;but&amp;quot; invokes the Contrast us to the implicit &amp;quot;If N is not (2) is translated into a case statement. 3. Knitting: Redundancies are recognized and merged This frequently resolves anaphora as a byproduct. 4. Resolving anaphora: Antecedents not round by knitting searched by to maximize the redundancy of the text. In &amp;quot;Decrease N by J, and if it is zero, reset it to MAX.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;N&amp;quot; is chosen over &amp;quot;J&amp;quot; as the antecedeut of &amp;quot;it&amp;quot; since it is N whose value is subject to change. 5. Search for Primitives: Certain predicates are &amp;quot;priapplication, i.e the task component has substitution rules for them. Where possible, a decomposition of the text in terms of these primitives is looked for. For instance, a tree is, in part, a set of nodes, a node is a set of fields, and a field may be a number. &amp;quot;Set&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;number&amp;quot; are primitives. To decrease N by 1 is to cause N to be equal to one less than before, and &amp;quot;cause to be equal to&amp;quot; is a primitive. 14th ACL Meeting 12 Semantic Analysis augments and interrelates the text What is produced is then given to the task component which performs two functions: 1. The temporal succession relations discovered by operation 2 may form only a partial ordering on actions. A linear ordering is imposed. 2. Substitution rules are applied to primitives to translate the semantic representation into code.

In the system that we developing for business application programs, these explanations. must be given in application terms rather than program terms. For example. the system might say, &amp;quot;The quantity shipped is the lesser of the quantity ordered and the quantity available,&amp;quot; rapther than &amp;quot;QS=MIN(Q0,QA)&amp;quot;. could certainly imagine generating such sentences having an inventory of sentence patterns and name phrases and using a fill-in-the-blanks approach. However, in addition to not being very interesting, such an approach would certainly not provide the same flexibility of expression that a more linguittically motivated approach would. Also, it seems reasonable to do this generation by utilizing information that, the system already has for understanding the user&apos;s English utterances. In our system, information is stored in the form of a senetwork with three parts. partcontains information about the programming language and about a specific the partcontains information about business and the partcontains information about English words. Each of these parts has its own internal structure, and there are links between the parts where appropriate. For example, 14th ACL Meeting 14 within the application part the node for the concept QUANSHIPD has a SUPerset arc to QUANT and a KIND arc to SHP. Between of QUANSHIPD is linked as the RAO (Related Application Object) arc of the program node QS, the language node QUANTIT (the stem of &amp;quot;quantity&amp;quot;) is linked as the RLO (Related Language Object) of QUANT, and the language node SHIP the RLO SHP. In general, the links between adjacent are The linguistic processing in our system is specified by phrase structure rules, the three of processing: semantic, syntactic, a pointer to node in the program part, alQng with some information about what aspect of that node is to be explained, these rules can generate an appropriate English statement by the structure the network. Because these statements are constructed from very small pieces (i.e. word stems) considerable flexibility of expression is possible, including taking into account dialogue context.

In language understanding systems that have been developed in the past few years these problems have been evaded, either by restricting the admitted use of mass nouns trivially, as in the SHRDLU dialogue system (Winograd 1972), or by explicitly excluding their use altogether, as in the LSNLIS question answering system (Woods 1972). The recently implemented question answering system PHLIQA 1 (Laiadsbergen 1976, Medema et al. 1975, Scha 1976) may be considered as a supsuantial step forward in this 14th ACL Meeting 16 This system performs the semantic analysis of complex mass noun expressions, including quantifying phrases, adjectives, amount expressions, etc. The analysis is based on a theory, in which a central role is played by a logical formalism, developed for the semantic representation of mass expressions. These representations were required to meet the following conditions: They should be in agreement with the ontological commitments of mass noun uses. In our view, the typical use of a mass noun indicates that the noun referent is viewed as a continuum; i.e. no articulation of the referent into individual elements is taken into consideration--which is of course not to that actually is a continuum. 2.

<abstract confidence="0.999145166666667">central prtblem for computational models of understanding is to formalize the meanings of words which are manipulated by the model. This paper reports on research directed towards the formalization of the meanings of nouns. The goal of the research is to de6cribe nouns sufficiently to enable the performance of a particular task of understanding: the appropriate selection of verb senses for multiply-sensed verbs. The hypothesis being tested is that noun meaning can be described by primitive &amp;quot;units of meaning,&amp;quot; here called features. The concepts of semantic features and componential analysis are. familiar; the contributions of this work are the development of empirical methods of analysis and the generation of a general set of features. The effect of noun meaning on the sense of a verb can be seen by examining simple sentences syntactic structure and no extra-sentential context. TO study noun meaning in a regular, non-subjective fashion, a large number of simple sentences of the form noun-verb-noun have generated. In groups of sentences, the subject noun and verb have been fixed, while the object noun is varied. The variance in the object noun causes the verb to have different readings, or different mappings of the lexical verb onto one of its senses. 14th ACL Meeting 19 From that group of nouns, in the object position, which the selection of the same the verb in question, the common thread of meaning is extracted and posited as a feature descriptive of that group of nouns. Repetition of this process for various verbs and nouns yields a set semantic features. These features are considered as formalizing noun meaning at least for purposes of verb sense selection. major problems in the above approach are 1) the inevitable intrusion of subjectivity into the feature extraction task and 2) the lack of generality of the feature set beyond the particular group of nouns and verbs studied. Several methods have been used to control subjectivity: repetition of the process using the same verbs with different nouns and viceversa, and the generation of features from the regular study other tasks of understanding which involve nouns--nounadjunct:noun pairs (e.g. school house) and noun analogies. To ensure as much generality as possible, the words considered in study have been from of most English words do any unified semantic field. have been interesting and In addito the commonly used features &amp;quot;animate,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;object&amp;quot;), features like &amp;quot;emotion,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;authority,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;concept,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;avocation&amp;quot; have been generated.

In response to this challenge, our research methodology contains some innovations, to maintain control on the complexity, while retaining the usefulness of our results for designers of man/machine communication systems. ACL Meeting Specifically, these innovations include --Case analysis, rather than functional design. --Independent judgment of the adequacy of the model. -Results form of individual algorithms, not full systems. --Algorithms which are transferable into nonresearch systems. We describe a research methodology, and the resulting Dialogue Modeling System which incorporates these innovations. The methodology analyzes naturally-occurring dialogues rather than prepared examples. For each dialogue we choose to analyze, a separate model is constructed. Each model is judged against annotations of the dialogue prepared by a trained observer who uses a predefined set of categories of phenomena. Although the processes employed in each model are to be as general as we find practical, they may also be as ad-hoc as necessary to make the model work. After several models have been produced in this fashion, we expect to find that, although many processes have been too idiosyncratic to be used in more than one model, many others have seen repeated application and thus have demonstrated their more general utility. These processes are regarded as the principal results, since they have been verified against a diversity of observers&apos; annotations. Subsequent speakers will provide details on the memory organization of the model, the processors which operate on these memories, and the issues raised by the inclusion of the observer in the model development cycle. 14th ACL Meeting 24 KNOWLEDGE STRUCTURES FOR MODELING DIALOGUE This paper describes the knowledge structures developed for our Dialogue Modeling System. Permanent knowledge is stored as Concepts in a semantic neEwork Long Term Memory (LTM), using a predicate/parameter representational format that are currently salient to the Processors of the System are represented by tokens of those concepts, called Activations, in the Workspace (WS).

An analysis of fourteen helping dialogues uncovered a surprising amount of consistency in the structure of these interactions, which is captured in the representation of the Helping Dialogue-gams. PROCESSORS FOR MODEONG DIALOGUE This paper provides details of the major Processors incorporated into our Dialogue Modeling System. These Processors are independent and asynchronous, monitoring the activity in the Workspace, and modifying it as appropriate, PROTEUS PROCESSOR -- Every activation in the Workspace has a &amp;quot;level of activation&amp;quot; (a number) which corresponds to degree of salience the model&apos;s activity. Each of these activattons imparts some of its salience to its immediate neighbors (including those in Long Term Memory). Similarly, the activation level of each node is augmented by that imparted to it by all of its neighbors. Whenever a concept in LTM accumulates activation above a certain threshold, an actiof that is in Workspace, Thus, if concepts, closely rblated to X active, X will also is the Processor which attends to this, thus providing mechanism for a concept into attention, based on the attention directed toward related concepts. 14th ACL Meeting 26 MATCH PROCESSOR -- This identifies concepts in LTM that are congruent to existing.activations in the WS The Dialogue Modelling System contains a number of equivalence-like relations. which Match uses to identify a concept in LTM as representing the same, thing as an activation of some seeminglyconcept such an equivalent is found, it is activated. Match thus provides the same sort of attention that Proteus does, that Proteus is driven by explicit connectivity of while responds to more indirectly-represented similarities. DEDUCE PROCESSOR -- This attempts to apply a rule, whenever rule become. active. Rules are concepts the form. They active by virtue of the activity of the concept which is their condition half. Deduce senses the activity of a rule and attempts to apply it by acticoncept for the action. correspondences evolved in the course creating of the (left) half of the rule are carried the (right) half. combination of Match and Deduce gives us all the capability of a production where the system is represented by the Rules in LTM. PROCESSOR Dialogue-games are a theoreconstruct we have developed to represent certain communicative forms used by people to interact in achieving goals person has. Each has of parameters, two and a topic. Each parameter has a 14th ACL Meeting 27 specifications on what can serve as a value for itself. We have found that these dialogue forms are identified in converby utterances that attempt to parameters. a Dialogue-game has been activated as possibly the communication form being proposed for a dialogue, the Dialogue-game Processor operates on it to verify that the parameters are properly specified, and then to establish the subgoals that specified in LTM the components of the particular Dialogue-game. PRONOUN PROCESSORS -- The Dialogue Model System contains set of Pronoun processors, including an I-Processor, a You- Processor, and an It-Processor. Each of these is invoked whenever the associated surface word appears in an input utterance, and operates to identify some preexisting activation that can be seen as referring to the same object.

This takes as input the text in a predicate calculus-like notation produced by a syntactic front end (3, 2). Various semantic operations are applied: 1) Inferences are sought to satisfy the demants made by predicates on the nature of their arguments (predicate interpretation). Redundancies are recognized and merged Anaphora resolved. operations work by a data base of world knowinferences, which are drawn response to the operations, and which carry a measure of their salience that varies with the context. relations are determined the. current sentence and the previous text against a small number of patterns. These patterns are stated in terms of inferences to be drawn from the current sentence and an &amp;quot;eligible&amp;quot; previous sentence, and the modification to be performed on the text if the pattern is matched. The patterns are of two 14th ACL Meeting 36 kinds--coordinating and subordinating. One coordinating relation is Temporal Succession: &amp;quot;The current sentence asserts a change whose initial state is implied by an eligible previous sentence.&amp;quot; Other coordinating relations are Cause, Contrast, Parallel, and Paraphrase. Two subordinating relations are 1) Example: &amp;quot;The predicate and arguments of the assertion of the current sentence stand in a subset or element-of relation to those of the assertion of an eligible previous sentence.&amp;quot; (See below.) 2) &amp;quot;Relative clause in disguise&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;The current sentence provides further information about an entity fairly deeply embedded in an eligible previous sentence.&amp;quot; (E.g. the second and third sentences of this abstract.) When this pattern is the modification made to the text is equivalent turning the current sentence into a relative clause. As analysis proceeds, a tree-like structure is constructed for the paragraph, with subordinating relations building the tree downward and coordinating links building it to the right. A previous sentence is &amp;quot;eligible&amp;quot; if it is on the right fronof this tree. For example, in a text if is disguised relative clause on then may be coordinated either or but if succeeds temporally, then may be coordinated only with The heart of the operation is an ordered heuristic search of the data base for desired inferences.

The evaluation function which orders the heuristic starch is based on the trength of the goal, the length of the chain of inference, and the current salience &apos;of inferences in the chain. a partialmatch is found, the difference, or the remainder of the goal, is placed high on a goal list for subsequent processing. Consider the text &amp;quot;Republicans, are discouraged about their prospects party chairman is convinced that many GOP congressmen will lose their bid for reelection.&amp;quot; Suppose for simplicity &amp;quot;be discouraged&amp;quot; decomposes into &amp;quot;believe something bad will happen&amp;quot; We have a partial match with the Example pattern since the second sentence asserts that a particular Republican believes something. Hence a principal goal for our processing of the &amp;quot;that&amp;quot; clause is to show that what is believed is than an event bad for a Republican will occur. This is shown by accessing the fact about a political party that one of its purposes is to win elections. 14th ACL Meeting 38 Goals generated by a partial match are also passed on subsequent sentences. In a Newsweekparagraph analyzed, first sentence asserts a change. The next three assert stages along the course of this is matched with the initial state the change thus generating as a goal the matching of and succeeding states.

<abstract confidence="0.979833388888889">A supplementary payment of $400,000 on an indexing contract was criticized on the floor of the House by Congressman Aspin of Wisconsin. According to the Congressional Record (May 4, H3909), Aspin said that the payment was made &amp;quot;under the provisions of a special bailout law (Public Law 85-804)&amp;quot; when &amp;quot;said that he would be &apos;impelled to leave the United States&apos; without the aid.&amp;quot; The bailout law, according to Aspin, &amp;quot;should only be used when the Pentagon really needs equipment that is vital to the national security.&amp;quot; The Latsec contract was one of several that Aspin not qualifying for the supplementary He called for a new study of the whole concept. Toma was quoted in newspaper reports as.saying that &amp;quot;If Contressman-Aspin were to look at our system and what it is for this country, he would withdraw his criticism.&amp;quot; story describes the basic contract one the Technology Wright-Patterson Force $460,000 for a three-year period.</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.985054333333333">There is a widespread myth among linguists that machine translation--or, properly, machine-aided translation--which was the object of intense effort and research a decade and a half ago, was found to be a failure and has since been abandoned. Nothing, in fact, could be further from the truth. Although a number of institutions and agencies in the U. S. and elsewhere undertook extensive efforts in the late 1950s and early 1960s to develop computer programs for translation, only one, the Georgetown University program, succeeded in becoming operational (without requiring extensive preor postediting).. The Georgetown program was the ultimate basis for two of the major functioning MT programs in the U.S. today, that at Oak Ridge and at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base._ These and other programs every year produce thousands of usable scientific and technical translations. However, they are all built on a research base which is now nearly twenty years old. The 1966 report of the Automatic Language Processing Advisory Committee (ALPAC), which concluded that MT results had not been fully satisfactory, led to the virtual elimination of government with from The Linguistic Reporter, 18(9), May-June 1976, page 2. FUTURE OF for MT research. While conclusion was not strictly justified (for example, scientists at Oak Ridge and Euratom, given choice between human and machine translation, both opted for the the in funding was timely, since the extant programs had largely exhausted the then-available possibilities in computer technology and linguistics. Unfortunately, much of the money spent on machine translation projects was applied to theoretical research rather than used for translation--which often disparaged as being practical in theoretical interest. It is ironic that had more research done directly on the development theory itself might have been accelerated by five to ten years. (Interestingly, linguists, so computers in the public mind, had little involvement with MT.) In the ten years since the ALPAC report, there has been considerable development in computer technology and in linguistics. state the has advanced in both the point where new synthesis is now could greatly improved translations on a more cost-effective basis. (Unfortunately, the projects in recent years to try this, at Berkeley, was curtailed last year for lack of funds.) has now come for a new effort in MT to be under- Properly conducted, such an effort would not improve the quality and efficiency of translation, but would add to our of substantive semantics, as well as FUTURE OF 49 deepen our understanding of particular languages.
