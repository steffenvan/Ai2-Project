Preface to the Student Research Workshop

<bodyText confidence="0.999318888888889">
This was the inaugural year of the Student Research Workshop, which remodeled the traditional student session into a new
format that allows students to present their research to a panel of scientific advisors in addition to the audience of workshop
attendees. Panelists have an opportunity to prepare questions and comments prior to the workshop, so we hope this format
will provide student authors with more detailed feedback and suggestions for further development of their research than
would be possible in the traditional setting. The new format also allows a longer time for presentations (25 minutes) and
for discussion of each paper by the panelists and audience members (15 minutes). We received 18 submissions and
accepted 8 (44%) for inclusion in the workshop. These papers describe original unpublished work in progress in which all
authors are students.
We would first like to acknowledge and thank the panelists:

We would like to acknowledge and thank Mary Harper, our Faculty Advisor and also the Principal Investigator on the NSF
grant, for her considerable help and advice. We received much helpful guidance from the ACL Executive Board and the
NAACL/ANLP 2000 Conference Executive Committee -- in particular Janyce Wiebe, Kathleen McCoy, Priscilla
Rasmussen and Marie Meteer. Also, we extend a heart-felt thanks to last year&apos;s Student Session Co-Chairs, Anna
Korhonen and Melanie Baljko, for their friendly and helpful replies to our many questions. Finally, we would like to thank
the National Science Foundation for their generous support of this workshop under grant number 0001350-IIS.1 The NSF
grant allowed students who might have had no other means of support to travel to the workshop and interact with the
scientific community.
