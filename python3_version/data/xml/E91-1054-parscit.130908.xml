<bodyText confidence="0.999650222222222">
There have been various attempts at
using the sublanguage notion for disambi-
guation and the selection of target language
equivalents in machine translation. In this
paper a theoretical concept and its imple-
mentation in a real MT application are pre-
sented. Above this, means of linguistic
engineering like weighting mechanisms are
proposed.

INTRODUCTION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999803545454546">
It has been proposed by a number of
authors (cf. Kittredge 1987, Kittredge/Lehr-
berger 1982, Luckhardt 1984) to use the
sublanguage notion for solving some of the
notorious problems in machine translation
(MT) such as disambiguation and selection
of target language equivalents.
In the following, I shall give a rough
summary of what sublanguages can contri-
bute to the solution of concrete MT pro-
blems.

A SUBLANGUAGE CONCEPT FOR
USE IN MT SYSTEMS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998934674418605">
To my knowledge, it was Z. Harris
who introduced the term &apos;sublanguage&apos; (cf.
Harris 1968, 152) for a portion of natural
language differing from other portions of
the same language syntactically and/or
lexically. Definitions are given by
Hirschman/Sager (1982), Quinlan (1989)
and Lehrberger (1982).
In order to be able to use such
characterizations in MT, they have to be
formalized in a way adequate to the MT
system in question. Such formalizable
properties were combined in the definition
of Luckhardt (1984) of what sublanguage
can mean for MT:
Text type represents the
syntactic-syntagmatic level of a sublangua-
ge for which only a rather weak
differentiation can be proposed (e.g. running
text, word list, nominal structures etc.).
Subject field represents the lexical
level of a sublanguage, i.e. for every
sublanguage a subject field is determined as
being characteristic, so that the MT system
may choose on the basis of the sublanguage
of a text those translation equivalents from
the lexicon which carry the same subject
field code as the translated text.
The lack of a commonly accepted
subject field classification for MT is a
serious problem. Such a classification is
tentatively proposed in Luckhardt/Zimmer-
mann 1991.
Text function represents the lexical-
pragmatic level. The function of a text (or
its target group) may determine the choice
of TL equivalents and of syntactic structure
or style.
The inhouse usage criterion covers a
number of aspects determined by special
requests of the MT user or the firm ordering
the translation. This is first of all a question
of inhouse terminology.

SUBLANGUAGES FOR MT:
MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9063195">
A typical maintenance requirement card of
the Bundessprachenamt (Federal Translati-
ons Agency) among others contains the fol-
lowing parts:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.898542">
1. designation of equipment
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.7871625">
text type &apos;nominal structure&apos;
text function &apos;title&apos;
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.963642181818182">
e.g.: &apos;Portable gasoline driven pump&apos;
2. tools, parts. materials
text type &apos;word list&apos;
text function &apos;accessories&apos;; e.g.:
- key set, head screw, L-type hex
- wrench, adjustable, open end 6&amp;quot;
- solvent, type II
- screwdriver, flat tip, medium duty
- rags, wiping
30(, -
3. procedure
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99484875862069">
text type &apos;instructions&apos;
(imperative style)
text function &apos;maintenance
instructions&apos;, e.g.:
&apos;Accomplish annually or when directed
as a result of operational test. Clean and
inspect fuel filter and float valve;
- remove pump housing covers, if applicable
- observe no smoking regulation
- remove choke knob and fuel connection
- remove float chamber and gasket
- clean all parts in solvent, allow to air dry
- inspect filter for clogging,
tears, and deterioration&apos;
(cf. Wilms 1983)
The example indicates how nicely the
different sublanguages of this type of
document can be differentiated, and it
ought to be possible in all MT systems to
capture these differences, especially the
typical &apos;imperative style&apos; of the text type
&apos;instructions&apos;. In order to achieve this it
must be possible to weight rules or
resulting structures like in the SUSY
system (cf. Thiel 1987). This is important,
because there is no absolute certainty that
all predicate structures appear as
imperatives in English or as infinitives in
German.

THE USE OF SUBLANGUAGES IN THE
STS PROJECT AND SYSTEM
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999894625">
Since 1985 the SUSY system has been
used as the core MT system within the
computer-aided Saarbriicken Translation
System (STS), i.e. in human-aided MT
and in machine-aided human translation.
Titles of scientific papers from German
databases were machine-translated and
postedited by humans, abstracts were
translated by translators (in all around 5
million words), with the MT system
automatically supplying the correct
terminology (from a terminology pool of
more than 350.000 German-English entries).
In the following a specific aspect of
sublanguage-dependent disambiguation is
described.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.9882545" genericHeader="method">
SEMANTICS OF PREPOSITIONS IN
TITLES
</sectionHeader>
<listItem confidence="0.9411905">
â€¢ Highly ambiguous prepositions like &apos;zu&apos;,
&apos;iiber&apos; etc. can be safely disambiguated on
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.975427432432432">
the basis of word order:
&apos;Zur Optimierung von Waldschadenserhe,
bungen&apos; =&gt; &apos;The optimization of wood
damage surveys&apos;
&apos;Zur Riickgewinnung von Warme
verpflichtet&apos; =&gt; &apos;Obliged to recover heat&apos;
&apos;Technologien zur Verminderung von
Abfallen&apos; =&gt; &apos;Technologies for the
reduction of waste&apos;
&apos;Uber Arbeit und Umwelt&apos; =&gt; &apos;Labour and
environment&apos;
A &apos;zu&apos;-phrase at the beginning of a title (the
top node of the nominal structure) always
denotes a TOPIC (1st example), otherwise
(3rd example) a purpose. &apos;Uber&apos; at the
beginning also denotes a TOPIC. These
rules only apply, if the PP is not embedded
in a predicate structure like in the 2nd
example, where it fills the zu-valency of
&apos;verpflichtet&apos;. So, if the parser produces a
structure like the following:
SUBJECT: none GOAL:riickgewinnen
OBJECT: Warme
there only has to be lexical transfer =&gt;
oblige
SUBJECT: none GOAL:recover
OBJECT: heat
to present a structure to generation that
carries enough information to produce the
English translation given above (&apos;Obliged to
recover heat&apos;).
Similarly, examples 1. and 3. can be
represented by the parser in a way which
allows the generation of the correct target
language equivalent, e.g.:
&apos;Zur Optimierung von Waldschadenserhe-
bungen&apos;
</bodyText>
<table confidence="0.251632833333333">
TOPIC: Optimierung
OBJECT: Waldschadenserhebung
transfer =&gt;
TOPIC: optimization
OBJECT: wood damage survey
generation .&gt;
</table>
<tableCaption confidence="0.242614">
&apos;The optimization of wood damage surveys&apos;
</tableCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.9956518">
The surface realization of the semantic roles
TOPIC and OBJECT is a task for generati-
on, i.e. transfer can be completely relieved
of rules treating such semantic roles (cf.
Luckhardt 1987).

CONCLUSION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999186592592593">
Sublanguage is a notion MT developers
ought to turn their attention to
when their system has reached a
stable and robust state offering the
necessary tools and methods of
language engineering like weighting
mechanisms
when their system is about to be
applied to large volumes of text with
distinct sublanguage characteristics
if a terminological data base system
has been established which makes it
possible to cover the lexical and
inhouse usage levels of
sublanguages and which can be
accessed by the MT system
if the necessary machine-readable
terminology is at hand.
A sublanguage is not as easy to implement
as it may appear from a first glance at texts
of a specific corpus, however distinct that
type of text may look. Very often the
apparently formalizable criteria turn out to
be useless for MT, although any human
reader could easily formulate them. The
METEO ideal of a sublanguage surely
cannot be reproduced easily.
