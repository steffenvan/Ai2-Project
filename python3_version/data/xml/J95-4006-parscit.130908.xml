This book about machine translation is aimed at readers with little or no special-
ist knowledge in the fields of computer science, artificial intelligence, linguistics, or
translation science, especially translators and translation users. It is designed to give
an overview of the state of the art of MT, to discuss some key issues of this technology,
and to provide us with an outlook into the future.
In my opinion, this aim has been fully achieved by the authors. As a teacher of MT
in a university degree course for technical translators, I find the book highly advisable
as a broad overview and first introduction for students. Apart from a few small flaws,
it is one of the most enlightening MT books for this readership in the past few years.
Its most prominent characteristic is that it adopts the viewpoint of MT users—
translators and end users who wish to &apos;lift the lid&apos; on what happens inside an MT
engine, and prospective buyers who want to distinguish between what can reasonably
be expected from this technology and the sometimes exaggerated claims of researchers
or vendors. Existing prejudices and misinformation are done away with. This is why
the book should, in my opinion, be required reading for students of translation and,
especially, students of computational linguistics who want to develop machine trans-
lation systems.
An overview is given from all the fields of knowledge and research that are nec-
essary for the description of MT problems. Topics include MT history, integration of
MT engines into the translation workflow, MT architectures, knowledge representa-
tion (on all relevant levels of knowledge), MT dictionaries, translation problems, input
standardization, MT evaluation, and possible future developments. Approaches from
artificial intelligence, however, such as that of &apos;scripts and frames&apos; for example, should,
in proportion to their relevance in modern MT research, have been given somewhat
broader room not only in the last chapter on &apos;future developments,&apos; but in the chapter
that deals with knowledge representation problems of the present.
The book&apos;s plain language and logical construction also make it easy to grasp for
non-native speakers of English. A summary at the end of each chapter facilitates keep-
ing the thread during continuous reading, while also enabling selective (re-)reading.
The annotated bibliographies in each chapter are a most useful aid to those who are
interested in finding more detailed publications for special fields of knowledge.
Computational Linguistics Volume 21, Number 4
Let us, however, pick up and correct two quite small items of misinformation, the
correction of which will serve the spirit of interdisciplinarity of the book.
In chapter 6, the authors speak of the inevitable differences between languages,
which lead to potential translation problems, as &apos;mismatches&apos;, a term quite widely
misused in MT research. Even though they emphasize that these differences are due
to the given language structures, my colleagues and I would advise not using the term
&apos;mismatch&apos; in this connection, since it is terminologically misleading. It tends to sug-
gest that translation is normally a one-to-one transfer process and these &apos;mismatches&apos;
are lamentable problem cases that complicate a translator&apos;s or MT engine&apos;s task. As
we all know, however, quite the opposite is true. The everyday, normal work of a
translator is constantly to cope with and compensate for these language differences,
which is one of the things that makes MT research both so hard and so exciting. Speak-
ing of &apos;mismatches&apos; tends to simplify and distort the picture of translation as a task.
Somewhere else in the book, the authors use the word &apos;differences&apos;, which describes
the problem more precisely.
The second and even smaller comment serves the same spirit of illuminating the
intrinsic properties of the translation task: In chapter 10, which is otherwise a brilliant
overview of MT evaluation, the authors suggest (in a parenthesis) that the evaluation
of MT output for accuracy or fidelity could be done by raters not in command of
the source language, which could be compensated for by comparing the MT output
to a &apos;high quality&apos; reference translation instead of the original source language text.
In our opinion, this method is impracticable, since comparison with a &apos;high quality&apos;
reference translation inevitably leads to the MT output being judged as &apos;low quality&apos;.
Modern translation science, however, knows that quality of a translation is defined by
its compliance with the translation order or translational aim given to the translator by
her client. The intended applications of and requirements on translations produced by
MT and by human translators, respectively, are in most cases unalike, which leads to
quite different standards of &apos;quality&apos;.
These two very small items of critique may serve as indications of the fact that,
seen from a translator-reader&apos;s point of view, the book could use a short section on
the state of the art of translation science, which would, in our opinion, fit very well
into its concept of interdisciplinary information. Such a section could be included in
one of the many next editions, which will surely be necessary, given the quality and
usefulness of the book.
Susanne Heizmann is a translator and works as an MT researcher and teacher at the University
of Hildesheim, where students of technical translation learn to judge developments in MT and
to work with MT systems. She is collaborating on the German MT research project Verbmobil.
