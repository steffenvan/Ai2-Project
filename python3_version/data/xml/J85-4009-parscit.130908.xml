David Weber suggested that some of the ACL surplus
might be used to encourage computational studies of
languages that would otherwise not be supported by
research grants. He was asked to formulate a more
specific proposal.

BROADENING THE USE OF THE INTERNATIONAL FUND
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998695">
The International Fund was set up to make ACL
memberships and publications available to colleagues
who have difficulty in using their national currencies for
international transactions. Recently, we have broadened
it to allow us to reach people whose current financial
situation makes it impossible for them to join the Associ-
ation. One recent member in this category, a student in
India, provides an appropriate model to justify this form
of participation. He states that when he is further along
in his graduate studies, he will reimburse the Interna-
tional Fund for its support. While there should be no
requirement to do that, it is a way of ensuring that access
to these sources of information are made widely avail-
able. If anyone knows of others in similar situations in
any part of the world, please provide the ACL office with
names and addresses. And do not hesitate to make
contributions directly to the International Fund to enable
us to extend this program.
