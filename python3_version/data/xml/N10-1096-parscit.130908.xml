Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999762294117647">
In a corpus of expert tutoring dialogue, con-
versation that is considered to be “off topic”
(non-pedagogical) according to a previous
coding scheme is explored for its value in tu-
toring dynamics. Using the Linguistic Inquiry
and Word Count (LIWC) tool, phases of tutor-
ing categorized as “off topic” were compared
with interactive problem solving phases to ex-
plore how the two differ on the emotional,
psychological, and topical dimensions ana-
lyzed by LIWC. The results suggest that con-
versation classified as “off topic” serves as
motivation and broad pedagogy in tutoring.
These findings can be used to orient future re-
search on “off topic” conversation, and help to
make sense of both previous coding schemes
and noisy data sets.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998398288461539">
Methods of investigating a large and noisy data set
are of paramount importance in computational lin-
guistics. Quite often, qualitative coding schemes
are used to capture snapshots of the data set, but
these may gloss over finer details or miss the larger
picture. Add to that the messy and unpredictable
nature of naturalistic data, and analysis becomes
even more complicated. Therefore, a multi-method
approach to understanding pre-existing coding
schemes and orienting future in-depth analyses of
those schemes proves to be a useful means of ex-
ploring one’s data.
Dialogue, particularly tutorial dialogue, is one
area where large, noisy data sets are common.
Computer and human tutoring data have been
parsed, coded, and tested by a number of research-
ers, and much effort has been put into making
sense of the variability in the task-oriented dialo-
gue (e.g. Chi, Roy, and Hausmann, 2008; Graesser,
Person, and Magliano, 1995; Person, Lehman, and
Ozbun, 2007). This work has all been in pursuit of
a deep understanding of the complex interaction
between the human tutor and student, which, if
understood, could be used to boost the efficacy of
artificially intelligent computer tutors. Expert hu-
man tutoring has been found to increase learning
gains by as much as 2 sigmas (Bloom, 1984),
which makes understanding their methods and mo-
tives the goal of any tutor research.
The corpus under examination here was col-
lected with the express purpose of understanding
how truly expert tutors manage a tutoring session,
with an emphasis on creating a corpus of naturalis-
tic dialogue data. The corpus has been investigated
at two different grain sizes, a dialogue move level
and a sustained phases level. Our study investi-
gates in detail an “other” category that these cod-
ing schemes, which emphasize the pedagogy of the
tutors and the students reactions, classify as “off
topic” conversation. Off topic conversation, by
virtue of its name, does not address the tutoring
task in which the tutor and student are engaged.
However, given the prevalence of off topic conver-
sation in the corpus, it is perhaps more likely that
the function or utility of off topic conversation in
expert tutoring is indirect rather than non-existent,
suggesting that the noisiest part of the tutoring di-
alogue corpus, off topic conversation, should be
further explored.
Because any topic not pertaining to the topic at
hand may be broached in off topic conversation
and because the dialogue itself is full of false

starts, interruptions, and fragmented sentences, it is
reasonable to explore off topic conversation using
a bag of words method that is applicable to a varie-
ty of formal and informal texts. One such method
is the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC)
tool developed by Pennebaker et al., (2001), which
looks for words that fall into specific, predeter-
mined categories such as COGNITIVE MECHANISMS
and POSITIVE EMOTIONS, then reports the percent
of words in the document that fall into that catego-
ry. LIWC provides over 70 possible categories,
and can help sketch a rough picture of the verbal
dynamics of a text (Mairesse and Walker, 2006;
Mihalcea and Strapparava, 2009). Using a readily
available tool like LIWC allows an examination of
the variability within off topic conversation based
on predetermined LIWC features. We can also
compare these results to a prominent pedagogical
category, such as scaffolding, that a current coding
scheme particularly emphasizes, and examine the
differences between the two.
In this analysis, the task-orientation and utility
of “off topic” conversation are investigated by
comparing its outcome scores in certain dimen-
sions of LIWC to a classic pedagogical and inter-
active phase of tutoring: scaffolding (Rogoff and
Gardner, 1984). Scaffolding, previously identified
in a tutorial dialogue coding scheme (Cade, Copel-
and, Person, and D’Mello, 2008), involves much of
the conversational give-and-take expected in ca-
sual off topic conversation, but is considered to be
a very focused, on task phase of tutoring. Knowing
how off topic conversation differs from scaffolding
may help further exploration of this forgotten
phase of tutoring. Likewise, it would give us direc-
tion in how to structure future coding schemes that
would help bring clarity to the data set.

2 Methods

<bodyText confidence="0.995578967741936">
In this study, pedagogical and non-pedagogical
phases of expert tutoring sessions were compared
on linguistic dimensions to get at the diverse nature
of off topic conversation within a naturalistic ex-
pert tutoring session.
The corpus under examination was collected in
a previous study on expert human tutors. There-
fore, what follows is a brief synopsis of how this
corpus was collected.
Ten expert math and science tutors (4 male and
6 female) were recruited through local tutoring
agencies and schools. Tutors were considered “ex-
pert” when they met the following criteria: they
had to be licensed to teach at the secondary level,
have five or more years of tutoring experience, be
employed by a professional tutoring agency, and
come highly recommended by school personnel
who specialize in providing support to students
who are struggling academically. Student partici-
pants were in grades 7 to 12, except for one who
was obtaining a GED. All of the students were in
academic trouble and actively sought out tutoring.
All sessions were unobtrusively videotaped at
the location decided upon by the tutor and student.
The researcher turned on the camera and left the
room when the session began. Each student parti-
cipated in a maximum of two tutorial sessions,
while each tutor participated in between two and
eight tutoring sessions. These 50 1-hour tutoring
sessions were then transcribed.
Two previously identified phases of tutoring (or
“modes”), Off Topic and Scaffolding, were com-
pared to investigate their psychological, emotional,
and topical differences. To do this, instances of
each mode were extracted from 30 sessions (all
sessions that contained at least one Off Topic and
one Scaffolding mode). If a session had multiple
occurrences of a single mode, those modes were
compiled into a single document. Documents were
capped at 1000 words each to prevent differences
in word count between the modes from affecting
the outcomes. These documents were also sepa-
rated by speaker (tutor or student); speakers may
be differentially motivated to broach certain topics,
and so separating out these effects leads to more
specific identification of conversational dynamics.
Each session’s Scaffolding and Off Topic docu-
ment was then analyzed using LIWClite 7, which
calculates the percentage of each document’s
words that fall into specific, predefined categories.
Though this version of LIWC offers over 70 lin-
guistic categories, only 15 were of interest in de-
termining the nature of off topic conversation:
SOCIAL PROCESSES (ex: mate, talk, they), FAMILY
(daughter, husband, aunt), FRIENDS (buddy, neigh-
bor), AFFECTIVE PROCESSES (happy, cried),
POSITIVE EMOTION (nice, sweet), NEGATIVE
EMOTIONN (hurt, ugly, nasty) ANXIETY (worried,
nervous), TENTATIVENESS (maybe, perhaps),
CERTAINTY (always, never), WORK (majors, class),
ACHIEVEMENT (earn, win), LEISURE (chat, movie),
HOME (kitchen, family), NONFLUENCIES (umm,

hm), and FUTURE (will, gonna).
These categories are the most relevant in illu-
strating the emotional, topical, and psychological
picture of conversation in tutoring when compared
with the more on-task behavior of problem solving.

Table 1. LIWC Dimensions with Significant Results
</tableCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.99996128">
Since a normal distribution of scores cannot be
assumed in this analysis, comparisons between Off
Topic conversation and Scaffolding dialogue were
made by comparing the LIWC scores of the modes
using both Wilcoxon’s signed-rank test and a
paired t-test, with similar outcomes. Effect sizes
were also analyzed by calculating Cohen’s d. Table
1 illustrates the significant results that emerged. In
total, each category investigated occurs more in
Off Topic than in Scaffolding, with the exception
of a student’s discussion of ACHIEVEMENT and
FUTURE.
From this analysis, an interesting pattern of re-
sults emerges. The Off Topic mode had previously
been characterized as a conversation that had noth-
ing to do with the lesson at hand, which connoted
that it is fairly irrelevant. However, Off Topic does
not seem to be so wholly “off topic.” Tutors and
students in the Off Topic mode talk about work
more often than they do in the Scaffolding mode,
which is a mode where nothing but work is done.
WORK words, according to the authors of LIWC,
are mostly school-related. Off Topic may be a
mode that allows the tutor to discuss test-taking
skills, study strategies, and remind students what
tasks need to be completed before the next tutoring
session. For instance, one tutor divided up a study
guide into manageable portions that needed to be
completed every night so that the student would be
prepared for an upcoming test. Previous to now,
these conversations have only been qualitatively
observed, but this supports a more in-depth analy-
sis of what type of work tutors are talking about
when they are supposedly discussing non-
pedagogical topics.
This hypothesis is supported by the significant
amount of conversation that takes place in Off
Topic about the home; if FAMILY and FRIENDS
(which may crop up in casual conversation about
HOME-related topics) are not discussed significant-
ly more in Off Topic, but HOME is, it may be that
tutors are informing students of what sort of work
needs to be done at home, and strategies to get
work completed when on their own.
This may also explain why both students and
tutors use more TENTATIVE words in Off Topic.
Although it would seem that students should be
more tentative and nonfluent when discussing dif-
ficult problem solving, they may be tentative in
Off Topic when the tutor makes suggestions about
studying and working. These suggestions of the
tutor’s may be framed using language like “may-
be” and “perhaps” to make them more polite, and
the student echoes this language in return. Thus,
tentativeness may not come from uncertainty, but
from suggestions couched in polite language.
It also appears that Off Topic conversation may
not serve as a “pep talk” time; although it does
contain more POSITIVE EMOTION words than Scaf-
folding, it does not expound upon the student’s
achievements. ACHIEVEMENT words are more
common in Scaffolding, where students are receiv-
ing praise for their problem solving efforts. Off
Topic conversation may seek to motivate the stu-
dent in more subtle ways. By using more words
that refer to SOCIAL PROCESSES (such as the third
person plural and words like “talked”), the tutor
and student may be building rapport with one
another. This rapport may become important later
on when the tutor gives the student blatantly nega-
tive feedback (Person et al., 2007), which can be
motivationally damaging. Rapport may protect
against flagging motivation in the student when the
tutor uses “us” language and connects with the stu-
dent in a more casual conversation.

4 Conclusions and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999993977777778">
Our goal in this work was to use a simple linguistic
analysis tool to uncover the hidden depths of an
existing dialogue coding scheme. The use of such
tools can paint a rich picture of the psychological,
emotional, and topical content of a corpus, and can
be used in two ways: first, it may help determine if
a deeper inquiry into a hypothesis is warranted,
and second, it can immediately orient future re-
search towards key issues in a corpus without the
less rigorous speculation and qualitative observa-
tions. The nature of broader coding schemes can
come to be understood in a multifaceted manner
using linguistic analysis, which may also inform
future work.
Here, we have observed that off topic conversa-
tion in an expert tutoring dialogue corpus operates
in a multidimensional way that is not irrelevant
when studying the dynamics of an expert tutoring
session. By using the LIWC tool developed by
Pennebaker et al. (2001), themes concerning inter-
personal rapport and global pedagogy emerge. The
purpose of “off topic” conversation in tutoring may
therefore be linked more to building a relationship
between the tutor and the student, which is neces-
sary for the trials of problem solving, and for the
dispensation of “study strategies” that are more
globally task-oriented, but are, nonetheless, impor-
tant in understanding the pedagogical strategies of
expert tutors. Off topic conversation was also hy-
pothesized to function similarly in other tutorial
work (Rosé, Kumar, Aleven, Robinson, and Wu,
2006).
One way of adding validity to these claims
would be to investigate the topics broached in Off
Topic through a topics model. In this way, recur-
ring themes in off topic conversation can be re-
vealed, and these themes can be aligned with the
LIWC findings to see if a pattern emerges. From
there, a new coding scheme may be devised to cap-
ture the multiple types of off topic conversation,
which, for now, seem to be divided between inter-
personal, rapport building and global pedagogy.
This method of exploring a corpus has proven to
be a useful approach when investigating possible
avenues of improvement to coding schemes.

The nature of broader coding schemes can come to be understood in a multifaceted manner using linguistic analysis, which may also inform future work. Here, we have observed that off topic conversation in an expert tutoring dialogue corpus operates in a multidimensional way that is not irrelevant when studying the dynamics of an expert tutoring session. By using the LIWC tool developed by Pennebaker et al. (2001), themes concerning interpersonal rapport and global pedagogy emerge. The purpose of “off topic” conversation in tutoring may therefore be linked more to building a relationship between the tutor and the student, which is necessary for the trials of problem solving, and for the dispensation of “study strategies” that are more globally task-oriented, but are, nonetheless, important in understanding the pedagogical strategies of expert tutors.

Therefore, a multi-method approach to understanding pre-existing coding schemes and orienting future in-depth analyses of those schemes proves to be a useful means of exploring one’s data. Dialogue, particularly tutorial dialogue, is one area where large, noisy data sets are common. Computer and human tutoring data have been parsed, coded, and tested by a number of researchers, and much effort has been put into making sense of the variability in the task-oriented dialogue (e.g. Chi, Roy, and Hausmann, 2008; Graesser, Person, and Magliano, 1995; Person, Lehman, and Ozbun, 2007). This work has all been in pursuit of a deep understanding of the complex interaction between the human tutor and student, which, if understood, could be used to boost the efficacy of artificially intelligent computer tutors.

ACHIEVEMENT words are more common in Scaffolding, where students are receiving praise for their problem solving efforts. Off Topic conversation may seek to motivate the student in more subtle ways. By using more words that refer to SOCIAL PROCESSES (such as the third person plural and words like “talked”), the tutor and student may be building rapport with one another. This rapport may become important later on when the tutor gives the student blatantly negative feedback (Person et al., 2007), which can be motivationally damaging. Rapport may protect against flagging motivation in the student when the tutor uses “us” language and connects with the student in a more casual conversation. 671 4 Conclusions and Future Work Our goal in this work was to use a simple linguistic analysis tool to uncover the hidden depths of an existing dialogue coding scheme. The use of such tools can paint a rich picture of the psychological, emotional, and topical content of a corpus, and can be used in two ways: first, it may help determine if a deeper inquiry into a hypothesis is warranted, and second</context>

Using a readily available tool like LIWC allows an examination of the variability within off topic conversation based on predetermined LIWC features. We can also compare these results to a prominent pedagogical category, such as scaffolding, that a current coding scheme particularly emphasizes, and examine the differences between the two. In this analysis, the task-orientation and utility of “off topic” conversation are investigated by comparing its outcome scores in certain dimensions of LIWC to a classic pedagogical and interactive phase of tutoring: scaffolding (Rogoff and Gardner, 1984). Scaffolding, previously identified in a tutorial dialogue coding scheme (Cade, Copeland, Person, and D’Mello, 2008), involves much of the conversational give-and-take expected in casual off topic conversation, but is considered to be a very focused, on task phase of tutoring. Knowing how off topic conversation differs from scaffolding may help further exploration of this forgotten phase of tutoring. Likewise, it would give us direction in how to structure future coding schemes that would help bring clarity to the data set. 2 Methods In this study, pedagogical and non-pedagogical phases of ex</context>

Off topic conversation was also hypothesized to function similarly in other tutorial work (Rosé, Kumar, Aleven, Robinson, and Wu, 2006). One way of adding validity to these claims would be to investigate the topics broached in Off Topic through a topics model. In this way, recurring themes in off topic conversation can be revealed, and these themes can be aligned with the LIWC findings to see if a pattern emerges. From there, a new coding scheme may be devised to capture the multiple types of off topic conversation, which, for now, seem to be divided between interpersonal, rapport building and global pedagogy.
