PREFACE

<bodyText confidence="0.8018256">
This volume is comprised of the papers presented at the Twenty-Sixth Annual Meeting of
the Association for Computational Linguistics. Over the years, this meeting has come to be the
forum at which some of the newest and most exciting work is first presented, and this year is no
exception.
It is, of course, the authors of the papers who are most responsible for this and who ensure
the success of the meeting. We all owe them our gratitude, as we do to all those who submitted
papers which unfortunately could not be included in the program. I am personally very pleased
at the high quality of the papers we had to choose among.
We are also indebted to the members of the Program Committee, who devoted a great deal
of time and effort to coming to these difficult decisions. They are Jared Bernstein, SRI Interna-

In addition much credit goes to William J. Rapaport who has been in charge of the huge task
of local arrangements, to Lynda Spahr who organized the demonstrations and exhibits as well as
providing major support for local arrangements, to Ralph Grishman who organized the tutorial
sessions, and to Mae Jones for her extensive secretarial help. I would also like to thank Dedre
Gentner who agreed to give the invited lecture.
Perhaps most of all I would like to express my gratitude to Don Walker, who published the
Call for Papers and this Proceedings, sent out the advertisements and registration packets, and
in general, this year as in past years, has kept the Association for Computational Linguistics to-
gether and operational. We owe our gratitude as well to Betty Walker, who does more for the
organization and its meetings than any of us know.

This tutorial will examine some recent
developments in theoretical syntax centered in,
or stemming from, work in Government-Binding
Theory, Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar,
and Lexical-Functional Grammar. I will try to
explain the linguistic motivations for the propo-
sals I will discuss, and also convergences among
the theories. Little in the way of background
will be assumed, beyond a rudimentary
knowledge of phrase structure grammars and
basic transformational mechanisms (movement,
deletion, etc.).

This tutorial will cover issues in text process-
ing, focusing on the current state-of-the-art in
text processing, the applications of text process-
ing, the architecture of a text-processing system
(using the Unisys PUNDIT system as an exam-
ple), issues of portability and extensibility, and
issues relating to large-scale computational
linguistics projects. The section on system archi-
tecture will describe a modular architecture, with
components that handle syntax, semantics and
pragmatics, emphasizing the importance of segre-
gating domain-specific and domain-independent
data. We will then discuss, in the context of re-
cent experiences with the PUNDIT system, the
issue of portability across domains and the tools
that support bringing up an application in a new
domain. We will also look at the problems asso-
ciated with building a large natural language
processing system: how to integrate people with
a variety of backgrounds (computer science,
linguistics), how to manage and maintain a large
system, and how to do development in multiple
domains simultaneously. We will conclude with
a survey of text-processing systems, comparing
their strengths and weaknesses as related to their
particular goals.

This tutorial will take participants through
the workings of a complete, albeit very simple,
generation system from the underlying conceptu-
al representation to the surface morphology.
This mini-system, which uses a &amp;quot;direct replace-
ment&amp;quot; algorithm, would be quite satisfactory for
the demands of most present expert systems; its
weaknesses will be used to motivate the research
that is going on in generation today. The major
themes of that research will be surveyed, concen-
trating on the rationales behind the adoption of
specific frameworks, such as systemic,
unification, or tree adjoining grammar. Illustra-
tions will be taken from current and historically
important systems. Emphasis will be on genera-
tion as a planning and construction process
which has markedly different concerns and issues
from language understanding, and on how this
has led to the approaches generation researchers
are taking today.

Efficient Parsing Algorithms

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.978269933333333">
Parsing efficiency is crucial when building
practical natural language systems. This is espe-
cially the case for interactive applications such as
natural language database access, interfaces to
expert systems and interactive machine transla-
tion. This tutorial covers several efficient
context-free parsing algorithms, including chart
parsing, Earley&apos;s algorithm, LR parsing and the
generalized LR algorithm. Augmentation to the
context-free parsing algorithms is also discussed,
to handle unification-based grammar formalisms
such as Lexical-Functional Grammar, Functional
Unification Grammar, and Generalized Phrase
Structure Grammar.

<abstract confidence="0.979575166666667">This tutorial will examine some recent developments in theoretical syntax centered in, or stemming from, work in Government-Binding Theory, Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar, and Lexical-Functional Grammar. I will try to explain the linguistic motivations for the proposals I will discuss, and also convergences among the theories. Little in the way of background will be assumed, beyond a rudimentary knowledge of phrase structure grammars and basic transformational mechanisms (movement, deletion, etc.).</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.997057846153846">This tutorial will cover issues in text processing, focusing on the current state-of-the-art in text processing, the applications of text processing, the architecture of a text-processing system (using the Unisys PUNDIT system as an example), issues of portability and extensibility, and issues relating to large-scale computational linguistics projects. The section on system architecture will describe a modular architecture, with components that handle syntax, semantics and pragmatics, emphasizing the importance of segregating domain-specific and domain-independent data. We will then discuss, in the context of recent experiences with the PUNDIT system, the issue of portability across domains and the tools that support bringing up an application in a new domain. We will also look at the problems associated with building a large natural language processing system: how to integrate people with a variety of backgrounds (computer science, linguistics), how to manage and maintain a large system, and how to do development in multiple domains simultaneously. We will conclude with a survey of text-processing systems, comparing their strengths and weaknesses as related to their particular goals.</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.99449135">This tutorial will take participants through the workings of a complete, albeit very simple, generation system from the underlying conceptual representation to the surface morphology. This mini-system, which uses a &amp;quot;direct replacement&amp;quot; algorithm, would be quite satisfactory for the demands of most present expert systems; its weaknesses will be used to motivate the research that is going on in generation today. The major themes of that research will be surveyed, concentrating on the rationales behind the adoption of specific frameworks, such as systemic, unification, or tree adjoining grammar. Illustrations will be taken from current and historically important systems. Emphasis will be on generation as a planning and construction process which has markedly different concerns and issues from language understanding, and on how this has led to the approaches generation researchers are taking today.</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.956217083333333">Parsing efficiency is crucial when building practical natural language systems. This is especially the case for interactive applications such as natural language database access, interfaces to expert systems and interactive machine translation. This tutorial covers several efficient context-free parsing algorithms, including chart parsing, Earley&apos;s algorithm, LR parsing and the generalized LR algorithm. Augmentation to the context-free parsing algorithms is also discussed, to handle unification-based grammar formalisms such as Lexical-Functional Grammar, Functional</abstract>
