Abstract
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99996135">
This paper briefly describes the current implementa-
tion status of an intelligent information retrieval sys-
tem, MARIE, that employs natural language process-
ing techniques. Descriptive captions are used to iden-
tify photographic images concerning various military
projects. The captions are parsed to produce a logical
form from which nouns and verbs are extracted to
form the primary keywords. User queries are also
specified in natural language. A two-phase search pro-
cess employing coarse-grain and fine-grain match pro-
cesses is used to find the captions that best match the
query. A type hierarchy based on object-oriented pro-
gramming constructs is used to represent the semantic
knowledge base. This knowledge base contains
knowledge of various military concepts and terminol-
ogy with specifics from the Naval Weapons Center.
Methods are used for creating the logical form during
semantic analysis, generating the keywords to be used
in the coarse-grain match process, and fine-grain
matching between query and caption logical forms.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999898961538461">
Recent approaches to intelligent information retrieval have
used natural language (NL) understanding methods instead of
keywords and statistical methods. However, the best NL
method is still unknown. This research studies a restricted
form of information, the description associated with
identifying multimedia data, i.e., natural language captions.
The rationale and motivation for using captions was
presented by Lum and Meyer-Wegener (1990). A prototype
parser was developed for demonstrating how natural language
queries could be used in conjunction with Structured Query
Language (SQL) for specifying retrieval requests from a
multimedia database.
Using these results at the Naval Postgraduate School, we
have been able to design a more robust natural language
processing and retrieval system for potential use at the Naval
Weapons Center (NWC). The Center&apos;s Photo Lab maintains
a database of over 100,000 photographs of project and
historical data from the last 50 years. Both captions and
supercaptions (caption about a set of captions) are used. The
current search and retrieval strategy uses manually created
keywords organized into a keyphrase - a head keyword and a
string of descriptive nouns. Our strategy entails parsing the
English captions to produce a logical form, then using the
logical form as the basis of the retrieval. We have labeled
this system MARIE (Epistemological Information Retrieval
Applied to Multimedia).

2 Methodology
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999951625">
The information retrieval system we have developed is based
on two stages:, a coarse-grain match to reduce the list of
possible information for a later fine-grain match (Rau 1987).
Three tasks that we deemed essential for this system included
the ability to represent and produce a logical form of the
caption, the ability to generate keywords from the logical
form, and the ability to load in previously stored caption
logical forms for matching against the query logical form.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.942072">
2.1 NL Parser
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999977592592593">
We have used an existing natural language processing pro-
gram, the DBG Message Understanding System
(Montgomery et al. 1989), as a starting point. This program
was developed for understanding dialog conversations. To ac-
commodate the existing captions at NWC, we had to make
modifications to the grammar, functional parser, and tem-
plate processor.
The grammar rules were changed to enable parsing of
punctuation, descriptive noun phrases, dates, geographic
locations, numeric and descriptive vehicle designations.
Additional rules were introduced to handle theme-oriented
phrases as opposed to agent-initiated sentences. The structure
of functional parse output was altered to accommodate
mapping into the type hierarchy. Specifically, tokens were
introduced to allow linking together words based on
syntactic relationships. The resulting output structure
appears similar to slot-assertion notation.
In the original DBG system, the template processor
produced frame structures for a semantic analysis of the
sentence. This portion of the system was redone using an
object-oriented programming methodology. We have created
a single type hierarchy to hold both nouns and verbs.
Producing the logical form is a matter of mapping the
predicate expressions from the functional parse output into
the type hierarchy. Methods are used to set inner cases for
both nouns and verbs (e.g., theme, agent, location, etc.); set
modifiers for nouns and verbs (e.g., adjectives and adverbs);

<bodyText confidence="0.99593">
set correlations between classes (e.g., part_of, has_part,
program_about, etc.); and generate the logical form from
class instances and associated slot values.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999614">
2.2 Generating the Keywords
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999977666666667">
Keyword records to be used in the coarse-grain match are ob-
tained from the type hierarchy directly rather than from the
logical form output. An instance of a class uses the class
name as the keyword. The keyword is based on logically
proper names, not definite descriptions as described by
Frixione et al. (1989). Methods are defined for caching
keyword records containing the caption identifier and any
case information to a keyword file for each class instance.
Each class has a keyword file maintained in sorted order.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.993358">
2.3 Matching
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.884564555555556">
Once an English query is instantiated within the type hierar-
chy to reflect the query logical form, the instances indicate
which class and subclass keyword files need to be examined
in the coarse-grain match. The corresponding keyword files
are read, and the keyword records are intersected using the
caption-id as the unique identifier. In the future, case
information will be used at query time for specifying the
role for a word (e.g, initiator of an action as opposed to the
recipient) and treated as a filter in selecting the appropriate
case records within the keyword file. Caption-ids whose
intersection score exceed a coarse-grain match threshold
become eligible for fine-grain matching.
Fine-grain matching entails mapping the logical form for
a stored parsed caption back into the type hierarchy and
matching it against the query instances within the hierarchy.
Figure 1 shows the appearance of the type hierarchy with the
existence of both the query &amp;quot;missile on stand&amp;quot; and caption
262865, &amp;quot;Sidewinder AIM 9R missile on stand,&amp;quot; within it.

<figureCaption confidence="0.974252">
Figure 1 Fine-Grain Matching in Type Hierarchy
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.955379">
Instance matching is based on subtype matching. In
Figure 1, the query instance for the class &amp;quot;missile&amp;quot; matches
the query instance for the class &amp;quot;AIM-9R.&amp;quot; Matching of rela-
tionships is currently based on exact matching. The match-
ing process is being modified to allow relationship matching
based on a predefined set of relationships. Caption-ids with
match scores exceeding a fine-grain match threshold are
presented to the user.

with the type hierarchy being developed using the Elsa-Lap
object-oriented Prolog tool. The system runs on Sun
Sparcstations and was designed using a client-server
relationship; the user search environment and key creation
interface form the two clients and a server process handles
the parsing of the natural language, generation of the keys,
and the matching. The lexicon has over 1000 lexical items
and the type hierarchy has over 200 classes. Further
implementation and methodology details can be found in
Guglielmo and Rowe (1991).

4 Future Research
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999945125">
The present system handles individual captions that describe
an individual photograph. Future work will investigate
supercaptions. For example, supercaptions that are used to
represent all captions from the same chapter of a book or a
supercaption that is used to represent all captions that
pertain to a combat plan. All of the member captions share
something in common, and the intersection of this common
information forms the supercaption.

5 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999715">
The ability to use natural language for query specification
and retrieval holds the most promise over keyword and
keyphrase approaches. We believe that the restricted use of
natural language in captions for multimedia data retrieval is
a less difficult task than full natural language fact retrieval.
We feel that we have a system that can be demonstrated and
built upon not only for retrieving images but also other
forms of multimedia data as well.
