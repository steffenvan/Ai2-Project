Georgian is a less commonly studied lan-
guage with complex, non-concatenative
verbal morphology. We present a compu-
tational model for generation and recogni-
tion of Georgian verb conjugations, rely-
ing on the analysis of Georgian verb struc-
ture as a word-level template. The model
combines a set of finite-state transducers

<bodyText confidence="0.999902333333333">
Georgian morphology is largely synthetic, with
complex verb forms that can often express the mean-
ing of a whole sentence. Descriptions of Georgian
verbal morphology emphasize the large number of
inflectional categories; the large number of elements
that a verb form can contain; the inter-dependencies
in the occurrence of various elements; and the large
number of regular, semi-regular, and irregular pat-
terns of formation of verb inflections (cf. Hewitt
1995). All of these factors make computational
modeling of Georgian morphology a rather daunting
task.
In this paper, we propose a computational model
for parsing and generation of a subset of Georgian
verbs that relies on a templatic, word-based analysis
of the verbal system rather than assuming compo-
sitional rules for combining individual morphemes.
We argue that such a model is viable, extensible, and

<bodyText confidence="0.9999131">
The Georgian verb forms are made up of several
kinds of morphological elements that recur in dif-
ferent formations. These elements can be formally
identified in a fairly straightforward fashion; how-
ever, their function and distribution defy a simple
compositional analysis but instead are determined
by the larger morphosyntactic and semantic contexts
in which the verbs appear (usually tense, aspect, and
mood) and the lexical properties of the verbs them-
selves.

2.1 Verb Structure

<bodyText confidence="0.999912">
Georgian verbs are often divided into four conju-
gation classes, based mostly on valency (cf. Har-
ris 1981). In this brief report, we will concentrate
on transitive verbs, although our model can accom-
modate all four conjugation types. Verbs inflect
in tense/mood/aspect (TAM) paradigms (simplified
here as tenses). There are a total of 10 actively used
tenses in Modern Georgian, grouped into TAM se-
ries as in Table 1. Knowing the series and tense of a
verb form is essential for being able to conjugate it.
The structure of the verb can be described using
the following (simplified) template.

2.2 Lexical and Semi-Regular Patterns
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999935035714286">
The complexity of the distribution of morphologi-
cal elements in Georgian is illustrated by preverbs,
thematic suffixes, and tense endings. The preverbs
(a closed class of about 8) indicate perfective aspect
and lexical derivations from roots, similar to verb
prefixes in Slavic or German. The association of a
verb with a particular preverb is lexical and must be
memorized. A preverb appears on forms from the
Future subgroup of series I, and on all forms of se-
ries II and III in transitive verbs. Table 2 demon-
strates some of the lexically-dependent morpholog-
ical elements, including several different preverbs
(row ‘Future’).
Similarly, thematic suffixes form a closed class
and are lexically associated with verb roots. They
function as stem formants and distinguish inflec-
tional classes. In transitive verbs, thematic suffixes
appear in all series I forms. Their behavior in other
series differs by individual suffix: in series II, most
suffixes disappear, though some seem to leave par-
tial “traces” (rows ‘Present’ and ‘Perfect’ in Table
2).
The next source of semi-regular patterns comes
from the inflectional endings in the individual tenses
and the corresponding changes in some verb roots
(row ‘Aorist’ in Table 2).
Finally, another verb form relevant for learners is
the masdar, or verbal noun. The masdar may or may

2.3 Regular Patterns
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999350346153846">
Verb agreement in Georgian is a completely regu-
lar yet not entirely compositional phenomenon. A
verb can mark agreement with both the subject and
the object via a combination of prefixal and suffixal
agreement markers, as in Table 3.
The distribution and order of attachment of agree-
ment affixes has been the subject of much discus-
sion in theoretical morphological literature. To sim-
plify matters for the computational model, we as-
sume here that the prefixal and suffixal markers at-
tach to the verb stem at the same time, as a sort
of circumfix, and indicate the combined subject and
object properties of a paradigm cell.
Despite the amount of lexical variation, tense for-
mation in some instances is also quite regular. So,
the Imperfect and First Subjunctive tenses are regu-
larly formed from the Present. Similarly, the Condi-
tional and Future Subjunctive are formed from the
Future. And for most (though not all) transitive
verbs, the Future is formed from the Present via the
addition of a preverb.
Additionally, the number of possible combina-
tions of inflectional endings and other irregularities
is also finite, and some choices tend to predict other
choices in the paradigm of a given verb. Georgian
verbs can be classified according to several example

paradigms, or inflectional (lexical) classes, similar
to the distinctions made in Standard European lan-
guages; the major difference is that the number of
classes is much greater in Georgian. For instance,
Melikishvili (2001) distinguishes over 60 classes, of
which 17 are transitive. While the exact number of
inflectional classes is still in question, the general
example-based approach seems the only one viable
for Georgian.

3.1 Overview
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999961282608696">
Finite-state networks are currently one of the
most popular methods in computational morphol-
ogy. Many approaches are implemented as two-way
finite-state transducers (FST) in which each arc cor-
responds to a mapping of two elements, for exam-
ple a phoneme and its phonetic realization or a mor-
pheme and its meaning. As a result, FST morpholo-
gies often assume morpheme-level compositional-
ity. As demonstrated in the previous section, such
assumptions do not serve well to describe the ver-
bal morphology of Georgian. Instead, it can be de-
scribed as a series of patterns at various levels of
regularity. However, compositionality is not a neces-
sary assumption: finite-state models are well-suited
for representing mappings from strings of meaning
elements to strings of form elements without neces-
sarily pairing them one-to-one.
Our model was implemented using the xfst pro-
gram included in (Beesley and Karttunen 2003). The
core of the model consists of several levels of finite-
state transducer (FST) networks such that the result
of compiling a lower-level network serves as input to
a higher-level network. The levels correspond to the
division of templatic patterns into completely lexical
(Level 1) and semi-regular (Level 2). Level 3 con-
tains completely regular patterns that apply to the
results of both Level 1 and Level 2. The regular-
expression patterns at each level are essentially con-
straints on the templatic structure of verb forms at
various levels of generality. The FST model can be
used both for the generation of verbal inflections and
for recognition of complete forms.
The input to the model is a set of hand-written
regular expressions (written as FST patterns) which
identify the lexically specific information for a rep-
resentative of each verb class, as well as the more
regular rules of tense formation. In addition to divid-
ing verb formation patterns into lexical and regular,
our model also provides a mechanism for specifying
defaults and overrides in inflectional markers. Many
of the tense-formation patterns mentioned above can
be described as defaults with some lexical excep-
tions. In order to minimize the amount of manual
entry, we specify the exceptional features at the first
level and use the later levels to apply default rules in
all other cases.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999435">
3.2 Level 1: The Lexicon
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999992941176471">
The first level of the FST model contains lexically
specific information stored as several complete word
forms for each verb. In addition to the information
that is always lexical (such as the root and preverb),
this network also contains forms which are excep-
tional. For the most regular verbs, these are: Present,
Future, Aorist 2SgSubj, Aorist 3SgSubj, and Per-
fect.
The inflected forms are represented as two-level
finite-state arcs, with the verb stem and morphosyn-
tactic properties on the upper side, and the inflected
word on the lower side.
The forms at Level 1 contain a place holder
“+Agr1” for the prefixal agreement marker, which
is replaced by the appropriate marker in the later
levels (necessary because the prefixal agreement is
between the preverb and the root).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99953">
3.3 Level 2: Semi-regular Patterns
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998783">
The purpose of Level 2 is to compile inflectional
forms that are dependent on other forms (introduced
in Level 1), and to provide default inflections for reg-
ular tense formation patterns.
An example of the first case is the Conditional
tense, formed predictably from the Future tense. The
FST algorithm is as follows:

<listItem confidence="0.9996214">
• Compile a network consisting of Future forms.
• Add the appropriate inflectional suffixes.
• Replace the tense property “+Fut” with
“+Cond”.
• Add the inflectional properties where needed.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.95494325">
An example of the second case is the Present
3PlSubj suffix, which is -en for most transitive verbs,
but -ian for a few others (see Fig. 1). Xfst provides a
simplified feature unification mechanism called flag

diacritics. Using these flags, we specify exceptional
forms in Level 1, so that default inflections do not
apply to them in Level 2.
The patterns defined at Level 2 are compiled into
a single network, which serves as input to Level 3.

3.4 Level 3: Regular Patterns
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999988636363636">
The purpose of Level 3 is to affix regular inflection:
object and non-3rd person subject agreement. As
described in section 2, agreement in Georgian is ex-
pressed via a combination of a pre-stem affix and
a suffix, which are best thought of as attaching si-
multaneously and working in tandem to express both
subject and object agreement. Thus the compilation
of Level 3 consists of several steps, each of which
corresponds to a paradigm cell.
The operation of the model is partially illustrated
on forms of the verbs ‘paint’ and ‘open’ in Figure 1.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.991247">
3.5 Treatment of Lexical Classes
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999986576923077">
The input to Level 1 contains a representative for
each lexical class, supplied with a diacritic feature
indicating the class number. Other verbs that belong
to those classes could, in principle, be inputted along
with the class number, and the FST model could
substitute the appropriate roots in the process of
compiling the networks. However, there are several
challenges to this straightforward implementation.
Verbs belonging to the same class may have dif-
ferent preverbs, thus complicating the substitution.
For many verbs, tense formation involves stem alter-
nations such as syncope or vowel epenthesis, again
complicating straightforward substitution. Supple-
tion is also quite common in Georgian, requiring
completely different stems for different tenses.
As a result, even for a verb whose lexical class is
known, several pieces of information must be sup-
plied to infer the complete inflectional paradigm.
The FST substitution mechanisms are fairly re-
stricted, and so the compilation of new verbs is done
in Java. The scripts make non-example verbs look
like example verbs in Level 1 of the FST network by
creating the necessary inflected forms, but the hu-
man input to the scripts need only include the infor-
mation necessary to identify the lexical class of the
verb.

4 Evaluation and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999966052631579">
At the initial stages of modeling, we have concen-
trated on regular transitive verbs and frequent irreg-
ular verbs. The model currently contains several
verbs from each of the 17 transitive verb classes
mentioned in (Melikishvili 2001), and a growing
number of frequent irregular verbs from different
conjugation classes. Regular unaccusative, unerga-
tive, and indirect verbs will be added in the near fu-
ture, with the goal of providing full inflections for
200 most frequent Georgian verbs.
The model serves as the basis for an online
learner’s reference for Georgian conjugations (Gure-
vich 2005), which is the only such reference cur-
rently available.
A drawback of most finite-state models is their in-
ability to generalize to novel items the way a human
could. However, the output of our finite-state model
could potentially be used to generate training sets for
connectionist or statistical models.

The model currently contains several verbs from each of the 17 transitive verb classes mentioned in (Melikishvili 2001), and a growing number of frequent irregular verbs from different conjugation classes. Regular unaccusative, unergative, and indirect verbs will be added in the near future, with the goal of providing full inflections for 200 most frequent Georgian verbs. The model serves as the basis for an online learner’s reference for Georgian conjugations (Gurevich 2005), which is the only such reference currently available. A drawback of most finite-state models is their inability to generalize to novel items the way a human could. However, the output of our finite-state model could potentially be used t</context>

<context position="3143" citStr="Tandashvili (1999)" startWordPosition="485" endWordPosition="486">re Georgian verbs are often divided into four conjugation classes, based mostly on valency (cf. Harris 1981). In this brief report, we will concentrate on transitive verbs, although our model can accommodate all four conjugation types. Verbs inflect in tense/mood/aspect (TAM) paradigms (simplified here as tenses). There are a total of 10 actively used tenses in Modern Georgian, grouped into TAM series as in Table 1. Knowing the series and tense of a verb form is essential for being able to conjugate it. The structure of the verb can be described using the following (simplified) template. 2See Tandashvili (1999) for an earlier model. Unfortunately, the information in the available publications does not allow for a meaningful comparison with the present model.
