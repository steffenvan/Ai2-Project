We first provide a short linguistic motivation for the
need for parsing formalisms more general than, for
example, ATNs. We then present such a formalism
using as an example a cascaded ATN developed ac-
cording to the object-oriented computation paradigm.
Central to this part of our paper is the formulation of
a correct backtracking algorithm for CATNs. We then
describe some generalisations that proved to be neces-
sary for this formalism to be applicable in the develop-
ment of dialogue grammars, which was our original
concern. These include the possibility of using several
types of processes (not necessarily ATNs) at every
stage of the cascade; a solution to the problem of li-
nearising tokens between different stages; and an al-
gorithm for specifying when certain stages may be
bypassed.

This report describes the overall goals of the natural
language system HAM-ANS (HAMburg Application-
oriented Natural Language System), which is currently
being developed at the University of Hamburg. The
project&apos;s more specific research topics are divided into
application demands (e.g., optimization, portability)
and basic research (e.g., explanation component, ex-
plicit partner model). HAM-ANS encompasses three
different application classes: natural language access to
a vision system (traffic at a street crossing), to a data
base system (fishery data), and for guiding a competi-
tive dialogue with a client (hotel reservation situation).
We introduce the system&apos;s general architecture and
knowledge sources, and describe two processing com-
ponents in greater detail: the semantic-oriented ATN
Parser and the strategy for evaluating the internal
representation of a user&apos;s question. The final section
contains implementation data and a description of
modifications of the LISP/FUZZY programming envi-
ronment. The appendix shows the processing of an
example utterance throughout the system and excerpts
from its various external knowledge sources.

The use of object-oriented programming languages is
often equated to the user of abstract data types. This
is only one aspect of object-oriented programming. In
this paper we show how to realize simple and complex
control structures in a clear and comprehensible way
using objects and the computing paradigm based on
message passing. The given examples are presented in
terms of the flavor system which enables one to pro-
gram in LISP in an object-oriented style. We describe
two different implementation techniques of control
structures — by means of the conditional and simple
iteration schemes. We then present very general forms
of backtracking and co-routines, whose usefulness
relies on the fact that the flavor system allows multiple
inheritance of information between flavors. This is
demonstrated by sketching the implementation of an
interpreter for cascaded recursive transition network
grammars, in order to show how to combine control
structures of different types without one of them pre-
dominating.

The paper addresses the problem of over-answering
yes-no questions, i.e. of generating extended respon-
ses that provide additional information to yes-no ques-
tions that pragmatically must be interpreted as wh-
questions. Although the general notion of extended
responses has already been explored, our paper reports
on the first attempt to build a NL system able to elab-
orate on a response as a result of anticipating obvious
follow-up questions, in particular by providing addi-
tional case role fillers, by using more specific quantifi-
ers and by generating partial answers to both parts of
questions containing coordinating conjunctions. As a
further innovation, the system explicitly deals with the
informativeness-simplicity trade-off when generating
extended responses. We describe both an efficient
implementation of the proposed methods, which use
message passing as realized by the FLAVOR mecha-
nism and the extensive linguistic knowledge incorpo-
rated in the verbalization component. The structure of
the implemented NL generation component is illustrat-
ed using a detailed example of the system&apos;s perform-
ance as an interface to an image understanding system.

For natural language dialog systems, going beyond
domain independence means the attempt to create a
core system that can serve as a basis for interfaces to
various application classes that differ not only with
respect to the domain of discourse but also with re-
spect to dialog type, user type, intended system behav-
ior, and background system. In the design and imple-
mentation of HAM-ANS, which is presently operational
as an interface to an expert system, a vision system
and a data base system, we have shown that going
beyond domain independence is possible. HAM-ANS is
a large natural language dialog system with both con-
siderable depth and breadth, which accepts typed input
in colloquial German and produces typed German
responses quickly enough to make it practical for real-
time interaction. One goal of this paper is to report
on the lessons learned during the realization of the
system HAM-ANS. This paper introduces the overall
structure of the system&apos;s processing units and knowl-
edge sources. In addition we describe some of the
innovative features concerning the strategy of semantic

This paper discusses the relevance of explanation com-

vates the need for such modules. First, the various
tasks of an explanation component are described an a
general architecture for such a component is proposed.
Then the broad range of applications of explanation
components is illustrated by several implemented ex-
amples from the current Al literature. In particular,
the explanation components of a backgammon pro-
gram (QBKG), a computer-aided design system
(CADHELP) and our natural language system
HAM-ANS are examined. As a negative example we
discuss the explanation component of a nuclear-power
plan consultant and identify some serious flaws in its
design. Finally, six guidelines for the design of expla-
nation components summarize the main results of the

Artificial Intelligence: vision, robotics, theorem prov-

A few benefits that are now visible are shown. To
evaluate the use of natural language AI-systems, re-

ogeneous types of information and (2) must appreciate
highly restricted language utterances as linguistically
appropriate to specific task environments. The bene-
fits of future natural language systems depend on three
conditions.
— dominance of cognitive and communicative abilities
over linguistic ones,
— realization of an elementary, dynamic partner mod-
el,
— transparency, as provided by an explanation com-
ponent.

This contribution has two objects. In the first section,
the position of language-oriented research in the field
of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its relevance to relat-
ed disciplines is more closely defined and our theoreti-
cal approach in the development of HAM-ANS
(Hamburg Application-Oriented Natural Language
System) is outlined. In the following two sections, this
system is presented with an emphasis on aspects which
are of theoretical interest. Although details of imple-
mentation are for the most part omitted, it is to be
emphasized that all of the processes and knowledge
bases described have been fully implemented.
After an introduction to the three dialogue situa-
tions investigated in our project, the organization of
the system as a whole is elucidated on the basis of
examples taken from one of the domains of discourse:
A Hotel Reservation Situation. The final section is
devoted to a special problem of pragmatics: represent-
ation and application of user modelling in an Al sys-
tem.

Case Role Filling as a Side Effect of Visual

Report No. ANS-21. In Proceedings of the First EACL Meeting.
Pisa, 1983.
This paper addresses the problem of generating com-
municatively adequate extended responses in the ab-
sence of specific knowledge concerning the intentions
of the questioner. We formulate and justify a heuristic
for the selection of optional deep case slots not con-
tained in the question as candidates for the additional
information contained in an extended response. It is
shown that, in a visually present domain of discourse,
case role filling for the construction of an extended
response can be regarded as a side effect of the visual
search necessary to answer a question containing a
locomotion verb. The paper describes the various
representation constructions used in the German lan-
guage dialog system HAM-ANS for dealing with the
semantics of locomotion verbs and illustrates their use
in generating extended responses. In particular, we
outline the structure of the geometrical scene descrip-
tion, the representation of events in a logic-oriented
semantic representation language, the case-frame lexi-
con and the representation of the referential semantics
based on the Flavor system. The emphasis is on a
detailed presentation of the application of object-
oriented programming methods for coping with the
semantics of locomotion verbs. The process of gener-
ating an extended response is illustrated by an exten-
sively annotated trace.

This article describes our approach to the solution of
three basic problems which arise in interfacing a natu-
ral language system to a background system (especially
to a relational data base management system): the
communication between the systems, the translation
process from the internal representational language of
the natural language system into the data base query
language, and the representation of conceptual knowl-
edge about the domain of discourse.
The coupling of the systems is elucidated with the
aid of the ISO reference model of &apos;open system

strated using the treatment of natural-language quanti-
fiers as an example. Finally the structures for repre-

An experiment is described which compares runtimes

on a DEC-system-10 computer. The most important
result of this comparison is that in most cases com-
piled LISP-programs are as fast as the equivalent

of the language processors) one is not constrained to
the use of conventional programming languages be-

The purpose of this paper is to describe the ENHANCE
system. ENHANCE automatically generates part of a
data base knowledge representation used for natural
language generation.
The generation system TEXT answers questions
about the structure of a data base. The knowledge
representation used by TEXT is a taxonomic descrip-
tion of the data base augmented with descriptive at-
tributes at each node. ENHANCE generates this repre-
sentation below the actual entity classes in the data
base. It uses the logical description of the data base,
the actual data base values, and some world knowl-
edge axioms to generate descriptions of sub-classes of
the entity classes. These descriptions will enhance the
generation system to give richer descriptions of the
data base.
This paper describes the knowledge representation
used by TEXT and explains how this representation is
augmented by the ENHANCE system.

Typical help processors are invoked explicitly by the
user or implicitly when an error occurs. Often a begin-
ner will not know that he needs help because the inef-
ficient use of commands will get the job done without
raising errors. WIZARD is an expert system that rec-
ognizes beginner misbehaviors and can automatically
start a help transaction.
The WIZARD processor relies on a special purpose,
dynamic, pattern matcher directed by a KL-One based
knowledge network. An author studies logs of begin-
ner interactions and develops sequence rules which
parse and properly identify misbehaviors. Objects that
drive the parser to understand VAX DCL commands
are coded into the network and a set of semantic pro-
gramming utilities is used to perform actual goal recog-
nition.
This thesis deals primarily with the implementation
of such a goal recognizing expert invocation system.
It is the WIZARD documentation and final working
report. I discuss the motivations for the design of the
system and detail the knowledge base and heuristics
that support goal recognition. Some issues of generali-
ty are taken up and potential topics for later research
are presented which will extend WIZARD&apos;s capabilities.

A Skeletal Automaton Approach To The Infer-

The inference problem for context-free languages is
approached from an automata-theoretic point of view,
through the inference of the skeletal automata de-
scribed by Levy and Joshi. Techniques for construct-
ing finite state machines from specifications of their
behavior are adapted to this class of tree automata
which have, as their behavior, sets of skeletons (trees
labelled only on their frontier nodes). It is shown that
when a bound on the number of states of the automa-
ton is known, the minimal machine may be inferred
from a finite sample of its behavior. Since these au-
tomata are known to recognize exactly the sets of
skeletons of derivation trees of context-free languages,
a consequence of this machine inference is grammati-
cal inference. Given a suitably chosen finite sample of
the derivation trees of good words in a context-free
language, it is shown that a grammar for the language
may be obtained from the resultant inferred skeletal
automaton. Thus the language will be learned from a
finite (structured) sample of its words.

This paper describes a new evaluator for attribute
grammars, noncircular or circular. The ordering of
attributes and their evaluation is accomplished by a
single procedure that simulates a depth-first search of
the dependency graph for a given input. The depen-
dency graph is not constructed. Instead the algebraic
semantic tree and the dependency graphs of the prod-
uctions which implicitly represent the dependency
graph are used. The incremental version of the evalu-
ator is obtained by a simple modification. It avoids
reevaluation of those attributes whose values are not
affected by the modifications of the input. The evalu-
ator has time complexity linear in the number of at-
tributes needed to specify the meaning of the input
string, and has space complexity linear in the size of
the parse tree.

This paper describes an effort to translate the Interlisp
KL-ONE system into FranzLisp to enable it to be run
on a DEC PDP-11/780 VAX computer. Our approach
was to first build a general purpose inter-dialect Lisp
translation system that is driven by transformation
rules. We then developed a set of specific Interlisp to
FranzLisp translation rules and an appropriate run-
time support system for the resulting FranzLisp ver-
sion of KL-ONE. The current collection of Interlisp to
FranzLisp rules, which is tailored for translating
KL-ONE, numbers about forty. The run-time support
environment (dubbed InterFranz) contains about 250
functions, mostly macros. In addition, a rudimentary
DWIM-like facility has been developed to handle cer-
tain classes of expressions which tend to slip through
the translation process.

In earlier work we described a system which built se-
mantic interpretations of nominal compounds — se-
quences of two or more nouns (or nominal adjectives)
which function as a unit. Our initial system took the
representations of the concepts making up the com-
pound and synthesized a number of concepts which
represented possible interpretations. Each candidate
interpretation was then assigned an &amp;quot;appropriateness&amp;quot;
measure based on a variety of factors. One source of
knowledge which was not used was the discourse con-
text. Nominal compounding is often used as a naming
device to refer to a concept already introduced, either
directly or indirectly, into the discourse.
Our current work in this area centers around three
questions:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.998372125">
(1) How can we effectively use discourse context as a
primary source of evidence for both hypothesizing
candidate interpretations (roughly in order of
plausibility) and for choosing a preferred interpre-
tation from among them?
(2) How much analysis is really required to do an
adequate job of understanding nominal com-
pounds used in discourse? We believe that many

<bodyText confidence="0.894937875">
compound strings may require only a relatively
shallow analysis.
(3) When is it appropriate to use nominal compounds?
We would like to formulate the conditions when a
particular nominal compound is likely to be accu-
rately and efficiently interpreted by a hearer.

There are two major aspects of computer-based text
generation: 1) determining the content and textual
shape of what is to be said; and 2) transforming that
message into natural language. Emphasis in this re-
search has been on a computational solution to the
questions of what to say and how to organize it effec-
tively. A generation method was developed and im-
plemented in a system called TEXT that uses principles
of discourse structure, discourse coherency, and rele-
vancy criterion.
The main features of the generation method devel-
oped for the TEXT strategic component include 1)
selection of relevant information for the answer, 2)
the pairing of rhetorical techniques for communication
(such as analogy) with discourse purposes (for exam-
ple, providing definitions) and 3) a focusing mecha-
nism. Rhetorical techniques, which encode aspects of
discourse structure, are used to guide the selection of
propositions from a relevant knowledge pool. The
focusing mechanism aids in the organization of the
message by constraining the selection of information
to be talked about next to that which ties in with the
previous discourse in an appropriate way.

The knowledge representation is an important factor in
natural language generation since it limits the semantic

tedious task to hand code a knowledge representation

For many years, the most frequently given reason for
developing natural language interaction with comput-
ers was that it would increase their accessibility to
infrequent (and possibly naive) users. Such users
would not have to learn a host of languages and proto-
cols in order to get the information they desired: they
could express their needs and requests as they would
everyday.
This viewpoint has led to valuable research aimed
at removing artificial constraints on a user&apos;s freedom
of expression, and useful results continue to appear.
But just expanding the ways a query can be phrased
and still understood does not in itself guarantee fruit-
ful Natural Language interactions. This paper presents
two complementary directions for extending Natural
Language interfaces to data bases, which can make
them more useful systems. These extensions make
Natural Language interfaces less simply &amp;quot;windows&amp;quot;
through which data can be called into view, and more
&amp;quot;articulate experts&amp;quot; on the data base system and what
it represents. The research we discuss involves (1)
broadening the range of query types that can be han-
dled and (2) extending the range of responses that can
be provided.

what is to be said, and 2) transforming that message
into English. A computational solution to the prob-

between strucutral and semantic processes. Schemas,
which encode aspects of discourse structure, are used
to guide the generation process. A focusing mechanism

<bodyText confidence="0.999991736842105">
In designing an interactive system (such as a HELP
system or a tutor) that gives advice or instructions to a
user, one must cope with a problem that can seriously
impair its effectiveness: the user&apos;s potential for misun-
derstanding the system&apos;s advice or instructions. Such
misunderstandings can occur at many points -- for
example, where the system has used an everyday term
in a technical sense or a new term that looks or sounds
like one the user is already familiar with. If such mis-
understandings are not detected and corrected quickly,
at best, time will be wasted, at worst, the user will fail
to achieve his/her goal. In human interactions the
responsibility to recognize and correct misunderstand-
ing is shared by the participants. We are addressing
the problem of enabling machines to take up their
responsibility in human-machine interactions. In this
paper, we categorize causes of misunderstanding in
human-computer dialogues and examine some ways by

Logic is that branch of knowledge concerned with
truth and inference — with determining the conditions
under which a proposition is true or one proposition
may be inferred from others. Such knowledge is essen-
tial for communication, since most of our beliefs about
the world come not from the world, but rather from
what others tell us about it. Hence, it is not surprising
that logic underlies a wide range of current research
on Natural Language (NL) interaction with machines.
However, it is not just first-order logic (FOL) that has
been enlisted in this enterprise: other logics have be-
gun to be used as well. This paper discusses three of
them: (1) default logic, for computing presuppositions;
(2) modal logic, for planning utterances to enlist help;
and (3) temporal logic, for offering competent data-
base monitors and correcting certain user misconcep-
tions.

Two types of dependencies are especially important:
subcategorization and filler-gap dependencies. Moreo-
ver, these dependencies can be unbounded. One of the
motivations for transformations was to account for
unbounded dependencies. The so-called non-
transformational grammars account for the unbounded
in different ways. In a tree-adjoining grammar (TAG)
unboundedness is achieved by factoring the dependen-
cies and recursion in a novel and, we believe, in a
linguistically interesting manner. All dependencies are
defined on a finite set of basic structures (trees) which
are bounded. Unboundedness is then a corollary of a
particular composition operation called adjoining.
There are thus no unbounded dependencies in a sense.
In this paper, we will introduce TAG&apos;s, investigate
their formal properties, and present some detailed
linguistic examples.

misconceptions and (2) getting from users the infor-
mation needed to help them solve their problems.

This paper presents a new efficient evaluator for at-
tribute grammars (circular or noncircular) allowing
conditional semantic equations, which generalizes the
algorithm presented in Jalili&apos;s Ph.D thesis. The es-
sence of the method, investigated and presented for
the first time in Jalili (also reported in Jalili and Galli-
er), is to perform a depth-first search of the (static)
reversed dependency graph associated with a parse
tree, interleaved with the execution of semantic rules.
This algorithm is suggested by the standard iterative
method for solving for least fixed points of continuous
functionals, and as a consequence, is correct with re-
spect to the fixed point semantics of attribute gram-
mars.
The efficiency of the attribute evaluator is achieved
via two mechanisms:

<listItem confidence="0.848591142857143">
(1) As in Jalili, the dependency graph is not con-
structed. Instead, it is implicitly represented by
the semantic tree and the dependency graphs of
the productions.
(2) The semantic rules are precompiled as programs
written in intermediate code called semantic
modules.

<bodyText confidence="0.999604">
The algorithm performs a &amp;quot;call by need&amp;quot; evalua-
tion, and is optimal in the number of attribute in-
stances evaluated. The time and space complexity of
the evaluator are linear in the number of nodes in the
parse tree for the input string.

Broadly speaking, this dissertation is an investigation
of some of the metatheory for higher-order logic
which may be important to builders of automated
theorem provers for this logic. In particular, expansion
trees are defined as generalizations of Herbrand
instances for formulas in a nonextensional form of
higher-order logic based on Church&apos;s simple theory of
types. Such expansion trees can be defined with or
without the use of skolem functions. These trees store
substitution terms and either critical variables or sko-
lem terms used to instantiate quantifiers in the original
formula and those resulting from instantiations. An
expansion tree is called an expansion tree proof (ET-
proof) if it encodes a tautology, and, in the form not
using skolem functions, an imbedding relation among
American Journal of Computational Linguistics, Volume 9, Number 2, April-June 1983 113

the critical variables is acyclic. The relative complete-
ness result for expansion tree proofs not using skolem
functions, i.e. if A is provable in higher-order logic
then A has such an expansion tree proof, is based on
Andrews&apos; formulation of Takahasti&apos;s proof of the cut-
elimination theorem for higher-order logic. If the oc-
currences of skolem functions in place of critical varia-
bles is equivalent to the requirement that the imbed-
ding relation is acyclic. This fact not only resolves the
open question of what is a sound definition of skolem-
ization in higher-order logic but also provides a direct,
syntactic proof of its correctness.
Since subtrees of expansion trees are also expan-
sion trees (or their dual) and expansion trees store
substitution terms and critical variables explicitly, ET-
proofs can be directly converted into sequential and
natural deduction proofs. A naive translation will
often produce proofs which contain a lot of redundan-
cies and will often use implicational lines in an awk-
ward fashion. An improved translation process is pre-
sented. This process will produce only focused proofs
in which much of the redundancy has been eliminated
and backchaining on implicational lines was automati-
cally selected if it was applicable. The information
necessary to construct focused proofs is provided by a
certain connection scheme, called a mating, of the
boolean atoms within the tautology encoded by an
ET-proof. Such a translation process could be made
part of a very generalized explanation facility.
This dissertation was submitted to the Mathematics
Department of Carnegie-Mellon University on 27 Au-

Because people&apos;s knowledge is often partial and/or
faulty, it is inevitable that misconceptions will be re-
vealed in the course of a conversation. If recognized,
the other person may say something to correct the
misconception, and the conversation continues. Just as
this is the case when people interact with each other,
so must it be when users interact with a computer
system. For example, in interacting with an expert
system, a user may reveal misconceptions about ob-
jects modelled by the system. By failing to correct
such misconceptions, the system may not only confirm
the original misconception, but may cause the user to
develop further misconceptions. It must therefore be
up to the system to recognize and respond to miscon-
ceptions in an effective way.
In this paper the space of possible object miscon-
ceptions is characterized according to the knowledge
base feature involved in the incorrect information.
This characterization is often useful in determining
how the user could have arrived at the response. Using
such a characterization and a model of what the user
knows, the system can reason in a domain independent
way about how to best correct the user. Factors which
affect the amount of information included in a correc-
tion (such as discourse and situational context) are
also examined.

ASK, A Simple Knowledgeable System, is a total sys-
tem for the structuring, manipulation and communica-
tion of information. It is a simple system in the sense
that its development concentrated on clean engineering
solutions to what could be done now with good re-
sponse times. The user interface is a limited dialect of
English. In contrast to expert systems, in which ex-
perts build the knowledge base and users make use of
this expert knowledge, ASK is aimed at the user who
wishes to create, test, modify, extend and make use of
his own knowledge base. It is a system for a research
team, a management or military staff, or a business
office.
This paper is designed to give you a feel for the
general performance of the ASK System and overview
of its operational capabilities. To this end, the movie
you will see will continue throughout the talk. Indeed,
the talk itself is a commentary on this background
movie. The movie is bona fide and in real time; it is

The NLP is a general purpose language processor

the English utterances it is given. The DBAP is an
algorithm with builds a query in a augmented relation-

Constructing natural language interfaces to computer
systems often requires achievement of advanced rea-
soning and expert capabilities in addition to basic nat-
ural language understanding. In this paper the above
issues are faced in the frame of an actual application
concerning the design of a natural language interface
for the access to online information retrieval systems.
After a short discussion of the peculiarities of this
application, which requires both natural language un-
derstanding and reasoning capabilities, the general
architecture and fundamental design criteria of a sys-
tem presently being developed at the University of
Udine are then presented. The system, named IR-
NLI, is aimed at allowing non-technical users to di-

offered by online data bases. Attention is later fo-

A major benefit of using natural language to access
the information in a database is that it shifts onto the
system the burden of mediating between two views of
the data: the way in which the data is stored (the
&amp;quot;database view&amp;quot;) and the way in which an end-user
thinks about it (the &amp;quot;user&apos;s view&amp;quot;). Database infor-
mation is recorded in terms of files, records, and
fields, while natural-language expressions refer to the
same information in terms of entities and relationships
in the world. A major problem in constructing a
natural-language interface is determining how to en-
code and use the information needed to bridge these
two views. Current natural-language interface systems
require extensive efforts by specialists in natural-
language processing to provide them with the informa-
tion they need to do the bridging. The systems are, in
effect, handtailored to provide access to particular
databases.
This paper focuses on the problem of constructing
transportable natural-language interfaces, i.e., systems
that can be adapted to provide access to databases for
which they were not specifically handtailored. It de-
scribes an initial version of a transportable system,
called TEAM (for Transportable English Access Data
Manager). The hypothesis underlying the research
described in this paper is that the information required
for the adaptation can be obtained through an interac-
tive dialogue with database management personnel
who are not familiar with natural-language processing
techniques.

Logic based programming systems have enjoyed an
increasing popularity in applied Al work in the last few
years. One of the contributions to Computational
Linguistics made by the Logic Programming Paradigm
has been the Definite Clause Grammar. In comparing
DCG&apos;s with previous parsing mechanisms such as
ATN&apos;s, certain clear advantages are seen. We feel that
the most important of these advantages are due to the
use of Logical Variables with Unification as the funda-
mental operation on them. To illustrate the power of
the Logical Variable, we have implemented an experi-
mental ATN system which treats ATN registers as Log-
ical Variables and provides a unification operation
over them. We would like to simultaneously encour-
age the use of the powerful mechanisms available in
DCG&apos;s, and demonstrate that some of these techniques

The natural language database query system incorpo-
rated in the KNOBS interactive planning system com-
prises a dictionary driven parser, APE-II, and script
interpreter which yield a conceptual dependency con-
ceptualization as a representation of the meaning of
user input. A conceptualization pattern matching
production system then determines and executes a
procedure for extracting the desired information from
the database. In contrast to syntax driven Q-A sys-
tems, e.g., those based on ATN parsers, APE-II is driv-
en bottom-up by expectations associated with word
meanings. The processing of a query is based on the
contents of several knowledge sources including the
dictionary entries (partial conceptualizations and their
expectations), frames representing conceptual depen-
dency primitives, scripts which contain stereotypical
knowledge about planning tasks used to infer states
enabling or resulting from actions, and two production
system rule bases for the inference of implicit case
fillers, and for determining the responsive database
search. The goals of this approach, all of which are
currently at least partially achieved, include utilizing
similar representations for questions with similar
meanings but widely varying surface structures, devel-
oping a powerful mechanism for the disambiguation of
words with multiple meanings and the determination of
pronoun referents, answering questions which require
inferences to be understood, and interpreting ellipses
and ungrammatical utterances.

Suppose we call &amp;quot;normative&amp;quot; any system based on a
set of constraints (whether pragmatic, semantic, or
syntactic). Input that violates the constraints of a
system could be termed &amp;quot;ill-formed&amp;quot;. Sondheimer and
Weischedel (1980) identify two general classes of
input appearing ill-formed to a normative system. In-
put will be called
absolutely ill-formed, if native speakers generally
agree that it violates one or more linguistic con-
straints, or
relatively ill-formed, if it violates some constraint(s)
of the computational system, though native speak-
ers perceive nothing odd about it.
Examples of absolute ill-formedness include mis-
spellings, mistypings, mispunctuations, tense and num-
ber errors, word order problems, run-on sentences,
sentence fragments, extraneous forms, and meaningless
sentences. Examples of relatively ill-formed input
include unknown words and requests that are beyond
the limits of either the computer system or the natural
language interface.
In natural language access (e.g. English access) to
information systems, the magnitude of the problem of
absolute ill-formedness can be seen in several case
studies. If one includes telegraphic and elliptical con-
structions in the class of absolute ill-formedness, then
case studies reported in Thompson (1980) and East-
man and McLean (1981) indicate that as much as
25% of queries to question-answering systems are
absolutely ill-formed. On the other hand, no matter
how large the dictionary, grammar, and underlying
system, there will always be unknown words and
phrases (e.g. proper names) and impossible requests
(due to user miconceptions of the capabilities of the
underlying system).

The task of understanding unedited naval ship-to-
shore messages is implemented in the presence of a
large database of domain specific knowledge. The
program uses internal syntactic and semantic expecta-
tions to analyze the texts and to correct errors that
arise during understanding, such as syntactic errors,
missing punctuation, and errors of spelling and usage.
The output of the system is a well-formed English
translation of the message. This paper describes some
of the knowledge mechanisms that have been imple-
mented in the NOMAD system.

Text analysis is a promising area for applications of
computational linguistics, with regard both to the pro-
spects for technological achievement and to the poten-
tial benefits that those achievements can provide.
Books, articles, and documents in text form are a ma-
jor source of information. Being able to use comput-
ers more effectively in the analysis of these materials
would have significant implications for virtually every
intellectual activity. Moreover, developments in this
area are essential if mankind is to take advantage of as
well as merely to cope with the vast quantity of textual
data already stored in computer-readable form, an
amount that is increasing rapidly because of the use of
computer-directed photocomposition for printing and
the practicality of optical character recognition techni-
ques.

In an age of increased attention to the problems of
database organization, retrieval problems and query
languages, one of the major economic problems of
many potential databases remains the entry of the
original information into the database. Specialized
information extraction (SIE) systems are therefore of
potential importance in the entry of information that is
already available in certain restricted types of natural
language text. This paper contains a discussion of the
problems of engineering such systems and a descrip-
tion of a particular SIE system, designed to extract
information regarding chemical reactions from experi-
mental sections of papers in the chemical literature
and to produce a data structure containing the relevant
information.

This paper describes a system that attempts to inter-
pret descriptive texts without the use of complex
grammars. The purpose of the system is to transform
the descriptions to a standard form which may be used
as the basis of a database system knowledgeable in the
subject matter of the text.
The texts currently used are wild plant descriptions
taken directly from a popular book on the subject.
Properties such as size, shape and colour are abstract-
ed from the descriptions and related to parts of the
plant in which we are interested. The resulting output
is a standardised hierarchical structure holding only
significant features of the description.
The system, implemented in the PROLOG program-
ming language, uses keywords to identify the way seg-
ments of the text relate to the object described. Infor-
mation on words is held in a keyword list of nouns
relating to parts of the object described. A dictionary
contains the attributes of ordinary words used by the
system to analyse the text. The text is divided into
segments using information provided by conjunctions
and punctuation.
About half the texts processed are correctly ana-
lysed at present. Proposals are made for future work
to improve this figure. There seems to be no inherent
reason why the technique cannot be generalized so
that any text of semi-standard descriptions can be
automatically converted to a canonical form.

RECONSIDER is an interactive diagnostic prompting
program which uses simple information retrieval tech-
niques to prompt a physician regarding possible diag-
noses, given a list of positive patient findings. Its
knowledge base consists of &amp;quot;structured text&amp;quot; defini-
tions of 3262 diseases and a synonym dictionary. Pa-
tient findings, and their synonyms, are matched against
inverted files of terms from the disease descriptions,
the number and selectivity of the patient findings
matching terms in a given disease description deter-
mine the disease&apos;s &amp;quot;score&amp;quot;, and the matched diseases
are sorted on this score to form a preliminary differen-
tial diagnosis. Definitions of diseases can be refer-
enced for viewing by name, or by their position in a
differential. While its first formal evaluation is not yet
complete, the performance of RECONSIDER continues
to exceed the expectations of user and designer alike.

This paper describes the REGIS extended command
language, a relational data language that allows users
to name and describe database objects using natural
language phrases. REGIS accepts multiple-word phras-
es as the names of tables and columns (unlike most
systems, which restrict these names to a few charac-
ters). An extended command parser uses a network-
structured dictionary to recognize multi-word names,
even if some of the words are missing or out of order,
and to prompt the user if an ambiguous name is en-
tered. REGIS also provides facilities for attaching
descriptive text to database objects, which can be dis-
played online or included in printed reports. Initial
data from a few databases indicate that users choose
to take advantage of the naturalness of multi-word
descriptions when this option is available.

nominative syntactic patterns which can be recognized
using a small domain-independent dictionary. The

More than two decades ago, scholars of the stature of
the late Y. Bar-Hillel were stating in detail their per-
ceptions of the futility of automated language transla-
tion by the methods then under development. Some
years (and many &amp;quot;progress reports&amp;quot;) later, others of
us came to see that general translation, without the
benefit of a robust and dominant semantics and prag-
matics, was not thinkable. The very slow and scat-
tered development of these latter, in both principle
and substance, is the most fundamental impediment to
the computer manipulation of language; in those tiny
domains where the work has been done, the results are
impressive — across a variety of methods.
Why isn&apos;t more of this work being done, with more
focus? Perhaps both the potential market and the
(mostly military) research sponsors are awed by the
magnitude of the challenge, and skeptical of the pay-
offs. One might envision a world in which, once the
skepticism has been answered, such answers would
stimulate rather than intimidate research.
Meanwhile, we should be busy with other goals in
mind, of which aids-to-translation is an obvious exam-
ple. Two of the papers before us describe approaches
to improving the human translation process. A third
valiantly wades into the struggle with computation
semantics. The fourth paper offers unsurprising re-
sults from an odd experiment. I should note that all I
had available to me were the abstracts.

This paper describes an on-going research project be-
ing carried out by staff and students at the Centre for
Computational Linguistics to examine the feasibility of
Machine Translation (MT) in a microprocessor envi-
ronment. The system incorporates as far as possible
features of large scale MT systems that have proved
desirable or effective: it is multilingual, algorithms and
data are strictly separated, and the system is highly
modular. Problems of terminological polysemy and
syntactic complexity are reduced via the notions of
controlled vocabulary and restricted syntax. Given
these constraints, it seems feasible to achieve transla-
tion via an `interlingua&apos;, avoiding any language-pair
oriented &apos;transfer&apos; stage. The paper concentrates on a
description of the separate modules in the translation
process as they are currently envisaged, and details

A class of natural language processors is described
which allow a user to display objects of interest on a
computer terminal and manipulate them via typed or
spoken English sentences.
This paper concerns itself with the implementation
of the voice input facility using an automatic speech
recognizer, and the touch input facility using a touch
sensitive screen. To overcome the high error rates of
the speech recognizer under conditions of actual prob-
lem solving in natural language, error correction soft-
ware has been designed and is described here. Also
described are problems involving the resolution of
voice input with touch input, and the identification of
the intended referents of touch input.
To measure system performance we have consid-
ered two classes of factors: the various conditions of
testing, and the level and quality of training of the
system user. In the paper a sequence of five different
testing situations is observed, each one resulting in a
lowering of system performance by several percentage
points below the previous one. A training procedure
for potential users is described, and an experiment is
discussed which utilizes the training procedure to ena-
ble users to solve actual non-trivial problems using
natural language voice communication.

Computer synthesized speech is and will continue to
be an important feature of many artificially intelligent
systems. Although current computer synthesized
speech is intelligible, it cannot yet pass a Turing test.
One avenue for improving the intelligibility of comput-
er synthesized speech and for making it more human-
like is to incorporate stress patterns on words. But to
achieve this improvement, a set of stress prediction
rules amenable to computer implementation is needed.
This paper evaluates one such theory for predicting
stress, that of Liberman and Prince. It first gives an

We then present such a formalism using as an example a cascaded ATN developed according to the object-oriented computation paradigm. Central to this part of our paper is the formulation of a correct backtracking algorithm for CATNs. We then describe some generalisations that proved to be necessary for this formalism to be applicable in the development of dialogue grammars, which was our original concern. These include the possibility of using several types of processes (not necessarily ATNs) at every stage of the cascade; a solution to the problem of linearising tokens between different stages; and an algorithm for specifying when certain stages may be bypassed.</abstract>

We describe two different implementation techniques of control structures — by means of the conditional and simple iteration schemes. We then present very general forms of backtracking and co-routines, whose usefulness relies on the fact that the flavor system allows multiple inheritance of information between flavors.

The paper addresses the problem of over-answering yes-no questions, i.e. of generating extended responses that provide additional information to yes-no questions that pragmatically must be interpreted as whquestions. Although the general notion of extended responses has already been explored, our paper reports on the first attempt to build a NL system able to elaborate on a response as a result of anticipating obvious follow-up questions, in particular by providing additional case role fillers, by using more specific quantifiers and by generating partial answers to both parts of questions containing coordinating conjunctions. As a further innovation, the system explicitly deals with the informativeness-simplicity trade-off when generating extended responses. We describe both an efficient implementation of the proposed methods, which use message passing as realized by the FLAVOR mechanism and the extensive linguistic knowledge incorporated in the verbalization component.

For natural language dialog systems, going beyond domain independence means the attempt to create a core system that can serve as a basis for interfaces to various application classes that differ not only with respect to the domain of discourse but also with respect to dialog type, user type, intended system behavior, and background system. In the design and implementation of HAM-ANS, which is presently operational as an interface to an expert system, a vision system and a data base system, we have shown that going beyond domain independence is possible. HAM-ANS is a large natural language dialog system with both considerable depth and breadth, which accepts typed input in colloquial German and produces typed German responses quickly enough to make it practical for realtime interaction. One goal of this paper is to report on the lessons learned during the realization of the system HAM-ANS. This paper introduces the overall structure of the system&apos;s processing units and knowledge sources. In addition we describe some of the innovative features concerning the strategy of semantic interpretation. Explanation Components as Dialog Tools No. ANS-17. Management. 1983: 45-48. This paper discusses the relevance of explanation components for knowledge-based dialog systems and motivates the need for such modules. First, the various tasks of an explanation component are described an a general architecture for such a component is proposed. Then the broad range of applications of explanation components is illustrated by several implemented examples from the current Al literature. In particular, the explanation components of a backgammon program (QBKG), a computer-aided design system (CADHELP) and our natural language system HAM-ANS are examined. As a negative example we discuss the explanation component of a nuclear-power plan consultant and identify some serious flaws in its design. Finally, six guidelines for the design of explanation components summarize the main results of the paper.</abstract>

To evaluate the use of natural language AI-systems, research ( 1) must consider the natural (language) environment of the problem-solving process with its heterogeneous types of information and (2) must appreciate highly restricted language utterances as linguistically appropriate to specific task environments. The benefits of future natural language systems depend on three conditions. — dominance of cognitive and communicative abilities over linguistic ones, — realization of an elementary, dynamic partner model, — transparency, as provided by an explanation component.</abstract>

Application-oriented work on natural language systems (NLS) is not only to be justified by linguistic or software ergonomic considerations, but also by the needs and requirements of users and customers. While several user studies exist, systematic evaluation studies for particular NLS, and experience with applied NLS, no study has yet been published that determines the demand for NLS and the requirements of potential customers. This article presents in detail the results from a market inquiry in the field of German NLS. The statistical data from the qualitative inquiry and examples stemming from the quantitative inquiry are analyzed. The Dialogue System HAM-ANS: what it is based on, how it works and to whom it responds K. Monk No. ANS-20. Berichte. December 1983. This contribution has two objects. In the first section, the position of language-oriented research in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its relevance to related disciplines is more closely defined and our theoretical approach in the development of HAM-ANS (Hamburg Application-Oriented Natural Language System) is outlined. In the following two sections, this system is presented with an emphasis on aspects which are of theoretical interest. Although details of implementation are for the most part omitted, it is to be emphasized that all of the processes and knowledge bases described have been fully implemented.</abstract>
