We report work1 in progress on adding
affect-detection to an existing program
for virtual dramatic improvisation, moni-
tored by a human director. To partially
automate the directors’ functions, we
have partially implemented the detection
of emotions, etc. in users’ text input, by
means of pattern-matching, robust pars-
ing and some semantic analysis. The
work also involves basic research into
how affect is conveyed by metaphor.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.974649515151515">
Improvised drama and role-play are widely used
in education, counselling and conflict resolution.
Researchers have explored frameworks for e-
drama, in which virtual characters (avatars) in-
teract under the control of human actors. The
springboard for our research is an existing sys-
tem (edrama) created by Hi8us Midlands Ltd,
used in schools for creative writing and teaching
in various subjects. The experience suggests that
e-drama helps students lose their usual inhibi-
tions, because of anonymity etc. In edrama,
characters are completely human-controlled,
their speeches textual in speech bubbles, and
their visual forms cartoon figures. The actors
(users) are given a loose scenario within which to
improvise, but are at liberty to be creative. There
is also a human director, who constantly moni-
tors the unfolding drama and can intervene by,

for example, sending messages to actors, or by
introducing and controlling a minor ‘bit-part’
character to interact with the main characters.
But this places a heavy burden on directors, es-
pecially if they are, for example, teachers and
unpracticed in the directorial role. One research
aim is thus partially to automate the directorial
functions, which importantly involve affect de-
tection. For instance, a director may intervene
when emotions expressed or discussed by char-
acters are not as expected. Hence we have devel-
oped an affect-detection module. It has not yet
actually been used for direction, but instead to
control a simple automated bit-part actor,
EmEliza. The module identifies affect in charac-
ters’ speeches, and makes appropriate responses
to help stimulate the improvisation. Within affect
we include: basic and complex emotions such as
anger and embarrassment; meta-emotions such
as desiring to overcome anxiety; moods such as
hostility; and value judgments (of goodness,
etc.). Although merely detecting affect is limited
compared to extracting full meaning, this is often
enough for stimulating improvisation.
Much research has been done on creating affec-
tive virtual characters in interactive systems. Emo-
tion theories, particularly that of Ortony et al.
(1988; OCC in the following), have been used
widely. Prendinger &amp; Ishizuka (2001) used OCC
to reason about emotions. Mehdi et al. (2004) used
OCC to generate emotional behaviour. Gratch and
Marsella’s (2004) model reasons about emotions.
However, few systems are aimed at detecting af-
fect as broadly as we do and in open-ended utter-
ances. Although Façade (Mateas, 2002) included
processing of open-ended utterances, the broad
detection of emotions, rudeness and value judge-
ments is not covered. Zhe &amp; Boucouvalas (2002)
demonstrated emotion extraction using a tagger
and a chunker to help detect the speaker’s own
emotions. But it focuses only on emotional adjec-
tives, considers only first-person emotions and

neglects deep issues such as figurative expression.
Our work is distinctive in several respects. Our
interest is not just in (a) the positive first-person
case: the affective states that a virtual character X
implies that it has (or had or will have, etc.), but
also in (b) affect that X implies it lacks, (c) affect
that X implies that other characters have or lack,
and (d) questions, commands, injunctions, etc.
concerning affect. We aim also for the software to
cope partially with the important case of meta-
phorical conveyance of affect (Fussell &amp; Moss,
1998; Kövecses, 1998).
Our project does not involve using or develop-
ing deep, scientific models of how emotional
states, etc., function in cognition. Instead, the
deep questions investigated are on linguistic mat-
ters such as the metaphorical expression of af-
fect. Also, in studying how people understand
and talk about affect, what is of prime impor-
tance is their common-sense views of how affect
works, irrespective of scientific reality. Metaphor
is strongly involved in such views.

Various characterizations of emotion are used in
emotion theories. The OCC model uses emotion
labels and intensity, while Watson and Tellegen
(1985) use positive and negative affects as the
major dimensions. Currently, we use an evalua-
tion dimension (positive and negative), affect
labels and intensity. Affect labels with intensity
are used when strong text clues signalling affect
are detected, while the evaluation dimension
with intensity is used when only weak text clues
are detected.

2.1 Pre-processing Modules
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999970177777778">
The language in the speeches created in e-drama
sessions, especially by excited children, severely
challenges existing language-analysis tools if
accurate semantic information is sought. The
language includes misspellings, ungrammatical-
ity, abbreviations (such as in texting), slang, use
of upper case and special punctuation (such as
repeated exclamation marks) for affective em-
phasis, repetition of letters or words for empha-
sis, and open-ended onomatopoeic elements such
as “grrrr”. The genre is similar to Internet chat.
To deal with the misspellings, abbreviations
and onomatopoeia, several pre-processing mod-
ules are used before the detection of affect starts
using pattern matching, syntactic processing by
means of the Rasp parser (Briscoe &amp; Carroll,
2002), and subsequent semantic processing.
A lookup table has been used to deal with ab-
breviations e.g. ‘im (I am)’, ‘c u (see you)’ and
‘l8r (later)’. It includes abbreviations used in
Internet chat rooms and others found in an anly-
sis of previous edrama sessions. We handle am-
biguity (e.g.,“2” (to, too, two) in “I’m 2 hungry 2
walk”) by considering the POS tags of immedi-
ately surrounding words. Such simple processing
inevitably leads to errors, but in evaluations us-
ing examples in a corpus of 21695 words derived
from previous transcripts we have obtained
85.7% accuracy, which is currently adequate.
The iconic use of word length (corresponding
roughly to imagined sound length) as found both
in ordinary words with repeated letters (e.g.
‘seeeee’) and in onomatopoeia and interjections,
(e.g. ‘wheee’, ‘grr’, ‘grrrrrr’, ‘agh’, ‘aaaggghhh’)
normally implies strong affective states. We have
a small dictionary containing base forms of some
special words (e.g. ‘grr’) and some ordinary
words that often have letters repeated in e-drama.
Then the Metaphone spelling-correction algo-
rithm, which is based on pronunciation, works
with the dictionary to locate the base forms of
words with letter repetitions.
Finally, the Levenshtein distance algorithm
with a contemporary English dictionary deals
with misspelling.

2.2 Affect Detection
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999778">
In the first stage after the pre-processing, our
affect detection is based on textual pattern-
matching rules that look for simple grammatical
patterns or phrasal templates. Thus keywords,
phrases and partial sentence structures are ex-
tracted. The Jess rule-based Java framework is
used to implement the pattern/template-matching
rules. This method has the robustness to deal
with ungrammatical and fragmented sentences
and varied positioning of sought-after phraseol-
ogy, but lacks other types of generality and can
be fooled by suitable syntactic embedding. For
example, if the input is “I doubt she’s really an-
gry”, rules looking for anger in a simple way will
output incorrect results.
The transcripts analysed to inspire our initial
knowledge base and pattern-matching rules had
independently been produced earlier from edrama
improvisations based on a school bullying sce-
nario. We have also worked on another, distinctly
different scenario concerning a serious disease,
based on a TV programme produced by Maverick
Television Ltd. The rule sets created for one sce-
nario have a useful degree of applicability to an-
other, although some changes in the specific
</bodyText>

knowledge database will be needed.
As a simple example of our pattern-matching,
when the bully character says “Lisa, you Pizza
Face! You smell”, the module detects that he is
insulting Lisa. Patterns such as ‘you smell’ have
been used for rule implementation. The rules work
out the character’s emotions, evaluation dimension
(negative or positive), politeness (rude or polite)
and what response EmEliza might make. Although
the patterns detected are based on English, we
would expect that some of the rules would require
little modification to apply to other languages.
Multiple exclamation marks and capitalisation
of whole words are often used for emphasis in e-
drama. If exclamation marks or capitalisation are
detected, then emotion intensity is deemed to be
comparatively high (and emotion is suggested
even without other clues).
A reasonably good indicator that an inner state
is being described is the use of ‘I’ (see also Craggs
and Wood (2004)), especially in combination with
the present or future tense. In the school-bullying
scenario, when ‘I’ is followed by a future-tense
verb, a threat is normally being expressed; and the
utterance is often the shortened version of an im-
plied conditional, e.g., “I’ll scream [if you stay
here].” When ‘I’ is followed by a present-tense
verb, other emotional states tend to be expressed,
as in “I want my mum” and “I hate you”.
Another useful signal is the imperative mood,
especially when used without softeners such as
‘please’: strong emotions and/or rude attitudes are
often being expressed. There are common impera-
tive phrases we deal with explicitly, such as “shut
up” and “mind your own business”. But, to go
beyond the limitations of the pattern matching
we have done, we have also used the Rasp parser
and semantic information in the form of the se-
mantic profiles for the 1,000 most frequently
used English words (Heise, 1965).
Although Rasp recognizes many simple im-
peratives directly, it can parse some imperatives
as declaratives or questions. Therefore, further
analysis is applied to Rasp’s syntactic output.
For example, if the subject of an input sen-
tence is ‘you’ followed by certain special verbs
or verb phrases (e.g. ‘shut’, ‘calm’, ‘get lost’, ‘go
away’, etc), and Rasp parses a declarative, then it
will be changed to imperative. If the softener
‘please’ is followed by a base forms of the verb,
the inputs are also deemed to be imperatives. If a
singular proper noun or ‘you’ is followed by a
base form of the verb, the sentence is deemed to
be imperative (e.g. “Dave bring me the menu”).
When ‘you’ or a singular proper noun is fol-
lowed by a verb whose base form equals its past
tense form, ambiguity arises (e.g. “Lisa hit me”).
For one special case of this, if the direct object is
‘me’, we exploit the evaluation value of the verb
from Heise’s (1965) semantic profiles. Heise
lists values of evaluation (goodness), activation,
potency, distance from neutrality, etc. for each
word covered. If the evaluation value for the
verb is negative, then the sentence is probably
not imperative but a declarative expressing a
complaint (e.g “Mayid hurt me”). If it has a posi-
tive value, then other factors suggesting impera-
tive are checked in this sentence, such as excla-
mation marks and capitalizations. Previous con-
versation is checked to see if there is any recent
question sentence toward the speaker. If so, then
the sentence is taken to be declarative.
There is another type of sentence: ‘don’t you +
(base form of verb)’, which is often a negative
version of an imperative with a ‘you’ subject (e.g.
“Don’t you call me a dog”). Normally Rasp re-
gards such strings as questions. Further analysis
has also been implemented for such sentence
structure, which implies negative affective state,
to change the sentence type to imperative.
Aside from imperatives, we have also imple-
mented simple types of semantic extraction of
affect using affect dictionaries and WordNet.

3 Metaphorical Expression of Affect
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999907625">
The explicit metaphorical description of emo-
tional states is common and has been extensively
studied (Fussell &amp; Moss, 1998). Examples are
“He nearly exploded”, and “Joy ran through me.”
Also, affect is often conveyed implicitly via
metaphor, as in “His room is a cess-pit”, where
affect associated with a source item (cess-pit) is
carried over to the corresponding target item.
Physical size is often metaphorically used to
emphasize evaluations, as in “you are a big
bully”, “you’re a big idiot”, and “you’re just a
little bully”, although the bigness may be literal
as well. “Big bully” expresses strong disapproval
(Sharoff, 2005) and “little bully” can express
contempt, although “little” can also convey sym-
pathy. Such examples are not only practically
important but also theoretically challenging.
We have also encountered quite creative use
of metaphor in e-drama. For example, in a
school-bullying improvisation that occurred,
Mayid had already insulted Lisa by calling her a
‘pizza’, developing a previous ‘pizza-face’ in-
sult. Mayid then said “I’ll knock your topping
off, Lisa” – a theoretically intriguing spontane-

ous creative elaboration of the ‘pizza’ metaphor.
Our developing approach to metaphor handling
in the affect detection module is partly to look
for stock metaphorical phraseology and straight-
forward variants of it, and partly to use a simple
version of the more open-ended, reasoning-based
techniques taken from the ATT-Meta project
(Barnden et al., 2002; 2003; 2004). ATT-Meta
includes a general-purpose reasoning engine, and
can potentially be used to reason about emotion
in relation to other factors in a situation. In turn,
the realities of metaphor usage in e-drama ses-
sions are contributing to our basic research on
metaphor processing.

4 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999294">
We have implemented a limited degree of affect-
detection in an automated actor by means of pat-
tern-matching, robust parsing and some semantic
analysis. Although there is a considerable dis-
tance to go in terms of the practical affect-
detection that we plan to implement, the already
implemented detection is able to cause reasona-
bly appropriate contributions by the automated
character. We have conducted a two-day pilot
user test with 39 secondary school students. We
concealed the involvement of an earlier version
of EmEliza in some sessions, in order to test by
questionnaire whether its involvement affects
user satisfaction, etc. None of the measures re-
vealed a significant effect. Also, judging by the
group debriefing sessions after the e-drama ses-
sions, nobody found out that one bit-part charac-
ter was sometimes computer-controlled. Further
user testing with students at several Birmingham
schools will take place in March 2006.

We aim also for the software to cope partially with the important case of metaphorical conveyance of affect (Fussell &amp; Moss, 1998; Kövecses, 1998). Our project does not involve using or developing deep, scientific models of how emotional states, etc., function in cognition. Instead, the deep questions investigated are on linguistic matters such as the metaphorical expression of affect. Also, in studying how people understand and talk about affect, what is of prime importance is their common-sense views of how affect works, irrespective of scientific reality. Metaphor is strongly involved in such views. 2 A Preliminary Approach Various characterizations of emotion are used in emotion theories. The OCC model uses emotion </context>

Normally Rasp regards such strings as questions. Further analysis has also been implemented for such sentence structure, which implies negative affective state, to change the sentence type to imperative. Aside from imperatives, we have also implemented simple types of semantic extraction of affect using affect dictionaries and WordNet. 3 Metaphorical Expression of Affect The explicit metaphorical description of emotional states is common and has been extensively studied (Fussell &amp; Moss, 1998). Examples are “He nearly exploded”, and “Joy ran through me.” Also, affect is often conveyed implicitly via metaphor, as in “His room is a cess-pit”, where affect associated with a source item (cess-pit) is carried over to the corresponding target item. Physical size is often metaphorically used to emphasize evaluations, as in “you are a big bully”, “you’re a big idiot”, and “you’re just a little bully”, although the bigness may be literal as well. “Big bully” expresses strong disapproval (Sharoff, 2005) and “little bully” can express contempt, although “little” can also convey sympathy.

Another useful signal is the imperative mood, especially when used without softeners such as ‘please’: strong emotions and/or rude attitudes are often being expressed. There are common imperative phrases we deal with explicitly, such as “shut up” and “mind your own business”. But, to go beyond the limitations of the pattern matching we have done, we have also used the Rasp parser and semantic information in the form of the semantic profiles for the 1,000 most frequently used English words (Heise, 1965). Although Rasp recognizes many simple imperatives directly, it can parse some imperatives as declaratives or questions. Therefore, further analysis is applied to Rasp’s syntactic output. For example, if the subject of an input sentence is ‘you’ followed by certain special verbs or verb phrases (e.g. ‘shut’, ‘calm’, ‘get lost’, ‘go away’, etc), and Rasp parses a declarative, then it will be changed to imperative. If the softener ‘please’ is followed by a base forms of the verb, the inputs are also deemed to be imperatives. If a singular proper noun or ‘you’ is followed by a base form of the ve</context>

The OCC model uses emotion labels and intensity, while Watson and Tellegen (1985) use positive and negative affects as the major dimensions. Currently, we use an evaluation dimension (positive and negative), affect labels and intensity. Affect labels with intensity are used when strong text clues signalling affect are detected, while the evaluation dimension with intensity is used when only weak text clues are detected. 2.1 Pre-processing Modules The language in the speeches created in e-drama sessions, especially by excited children, severely challenges existing language-analysis tools if accurate semantic information is sought.
