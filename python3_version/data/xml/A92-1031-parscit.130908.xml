1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9932275">
Access to on-line corpora is a useful tool for studies in
lexicography, linguistics, and translation. Many means
of accessing such corpora are available, but few, if any,
provide more than a language for matching character
strings. As a result, the user is obliged to spend a great
deal of time extracting information herself. As more
and more texts are put in machine readable format, it
becomes increasingly obvious that more specialized, in-
telligent tools are required to fully exploit the available
data. BCP, the Bilingual Concordancy Program under
development at ISSCO, is an instance of such a tool.
In previous work done at ISSCO on BCP, a rather
oversimplified view of text structure was taken [Warwick
et al., 1989]. Attention was focused on the difficulties
of alignment and somewhat less so on access questions.
Alignment remains a subject of active research, but ex-
perience has proven that text marking and morphology
are not to be taken so lightly. Indeed, many small dif-
ficulties have shown themselves to be insurmountable
without the aid of heuristic decision modules. As a re-
sult, the initial approach to text tagging and morphology
has been thoroughly revised.

2 Brief Overview
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.91916015">
The BCP package consists of four submodules: pre-
processer, morphology, alignment, and access. The text
pre-processor, bcpmark, marks paragraph and sentence
boundaries, numbers, words, and punctuation. The
morphological analyzer, bcpmorf, is built around a
unification-based parser, and returns feature-structure
descriptions in SGML format, although the feature
structure itself is in a linear notation only. The align-
ment module is the subject of much experimentation and
currently is running with the Church-Gale alignment al-
gorithm [Gale and Church, 19911. The access module has
been described in previous work [Warwick et al., 19891
and will not be discussed further here. The focus of this
abstract will be on bcpmark and bcpmorf.

3 bcpmark: The Pre-Processor
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992797">
bcpmark is the first step in preparing text for the align-
ment program. It marks paragraph and sentence bound-
aries, numbers, words, and punctuation, with the out-
put in SGML notation. bcpmark is easily customized
to suit a particular text type or language via a user-
defined data file. Extensions and alterations to the data
are accordingly simple. There are accompanying tools
to check number standardization results and sentence
boundary marking. Languages currently supported are
French, German, Italian, Czech, and English.

3.1 Input Text
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99905625">
bcpmark is intended to be usable on all text types, so
that entails a certain amount of flexibility. Regardless,
there are two major problems: no interpretation of the
input text, and the need to be &amp;quot;parameterized&amp;quot; for dif-
ferent textual conventions.
Problems instantly arise in conjunction with numbers,
abbreviations, conflicts with differing punctuation con-
ventions, and capitalization. In particular, German noun
capitalization causes great problems to a system which
relies heavily on capitalization marking sentence begin-
nings.
In bcpmark, the sentences are marked by either the
onset of a paragraph marker or by encountering an end-
of-sentence punctuation mark in the appropriate context
for a particular language. We define six contexts essen-
tial for deliminating sentences:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.970290888888889">
1. Characters are always considered part of a word.
2. Abbreviations which can never end a sentence even
if they are followed by a dot. There may also be
contracted abbreviations.
3. Abbreviations which in front of a number cannot
end a sentence.
4. Words which followed by a number followed by a
period usually signal a sentence boundary.
5. The sequence

single-capital-letter. capitalized-word
is normally not recognized to be a sentence bound-
ary.
6. Certain words followed by sequences of the form

</footnote>

<bodyText confidence="0.995875285714286">
(especially in German texts) should not be marked
as sentence boundaries.
7. Words which probably do not start a new sentence
if preceded by a sequence number . This is espe-
cially useful for languages like German, which mark
ordinal numerals by dots which do not indicate an
end of sentence.

4 Morphology
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998913">
Morphological variations can be classified as inflection,
derivation, and compounding [van Gaalen et al., 1991].
An adequate morphology should be able to handle all
three. There are several parts to the BCP morphology:
the morphology grammar, the regular and irregular dic-
tionaries, and the code. There is also a facility for testing
and debugging the morphology grammar. The output
format is an SGML-notation version of feature struc-
tures, where ambiguous analyses are expressed in tags
raher than multiple word-forms in the text.

5 Alignment
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999819432432433">
The technique originally used for aligning texts was to
link regions of texts according to regularity of word co-
occurrences across texts [Catizone et al., 1989]. Pairs
of words were linked if they have similar distributions
in their home texts. This strategy doesn&apos;t always work
well because in many languages a good writer does not
use the exact same word many times in a text. Simi-
larly, a good translator does not always translate a word
exactly the same way every time it occurs. Clearly this
algorithm is heavily text dependent. For texts with lim-
ited vocabularies this might work extremely well, but in
&amp;quot;free&amp;quot; text it fails.
Currently we are experimenting with assorted algo-
rithms; a major problem is having good test texts to
run them on. So far the best results on reasonable text
come from the Gale-Church algorithm [Gale and Church,
19911. It has been tested on English, German, French,
Czech, and Italian parallel texts. The Gale-Church al-
gorithm relies on the length of regions, where the char-
acter is the unit of measurement. (For details see their
paper.) We have experienced three problems with this
method. First, the implementation of the algorithm pub-
lished in Church-Gale severely limits the size of the input
file [Gale and Church, 1991]. This is, however, merely
an implementation problem. Second, there is no way
to set &amp;quot;anchor points&amp;quot; and align around them. That is,
one cannot pick two anchor points, one in each text, and
have the program align the corresponding regions above
and below the anchor points. (See [Brown et al., 1991]
for discussion of an alternative.) This is not necessarily
a problem either, and can be worked around. Lastly, it
does not give usable results on texts which are not abso-
lutely parallel. That is to say, on texts which do not have
exactly the same number of large regions, with the same
hierarchical structure. A single extra line of characters
in one text will cause a complete failure of the alignment
algorithm. This is a major difficulty.

6 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999976666666667">
We are very happy with our marking program and ea-
gerly anticipating thorough testing of the new morphol-
ogy, especially with regards to extensive experimenta-
tion with German texts. We are satisfied with the cur-
rent alignment method. We may also end up writing a
parser to disambiguate the tagged text and this would fit
in well with previous ISSCO work on unification-based
grammatical formalisms [Estival, 1990]. Clearly there is
room for expansion and improvement.
The modular structure of BCP is a great strength, as
it enables independent use of the modules. Similarly, the
access module functions to its full capacity on the output
of the other three, but can also be used on output of the
alignment unit alone. This great flexibility clearly lends
itself to ease of integration into other systems.
