Abstract
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999551333333333">
The TAP-XL Automated Analyst’s Assistant is
an application designed to help an English-
speaking analyst write a topical report, culling
information from a large inflow of multi-
lingual, multimedia data. It gives users the
ability to spend their time finding more data
relevant to their task, and gives them
translingual reach into other languages by
leveraging human language technology.

1 System Description
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999926428571429">
The TAP-XL system exploits language technology to
monitor the user’s interactions with the system and
provide suggestions of relevant information to analysts,
maximizing time spent reading relevant documents and
writing reports. Any document, passage, or fact that a
user saves in a report is deemed to be valuable, and the
TAP-XL system then proactively suggests related
information that is located in the stream of documents.
Rather than force the user to learn a suite of distinct
tools, this “suggestion” metaphor is employed
throughout TAP-XL: all language technologies pull
together to bring value to the user through data, rather
than via additional tools, interfaces, and metaphors that
must be learned separately.

2 Use Model
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99997128125">
The user interacts with the TAP-XL system via a
traditional word processor (Microsoft Word), with an
additional web-based user interface.
The user writes a report based on an initial problem
statement. The problem statement includes names of
people, locations, and organizations relevant to a topic,
as well as hypotheses about events involving these
entities that are to be corroborated or refuted in the
report.
Suggestions appear in a window to the left of the
word processor. The initial set of suggestions is
generated from the text of the problem statement. Each
suggestion leads to a document or collection of docu-
ments. Passages from a document deemed relevant by
the user can be cited in the report via a “create citation”
button. This places the selected excerpt in the report,
along with a hyperlink to the original source document.
It also triggers the TAP-XL system to provide additional
suggestions relevant to the passage the user selected, as
well as documents relevant to any entities included in
the citation. Suggestions deemed not relevant can be
deleted. A screenshot of the TAP-XL system in use may
be seen in Figure 1.
In addition to the suggestion mechanism, users may
employ a traditional keyword-based query mechanism
to locate documents in the system.
The process of system suggestion → citation →
additional suggestions results in a feedback loop
between the TAP-XL system and the user’s report. This
feedback loop is designed to allow many different
human-language technologies to contribute relevant
information to the user.

3 System Architecture
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997061181818182">
The analytical portion of TAP-XL is a distributed,
component-based system. Components include Machine
Translation (Arabic to English), Document Clustering,
Multi-document Summarization, and Fact Extraction.
The components are distributed across the Internet,
using a custom web service technology called the TAP
Connector. The TAP Connector uses industry-standard
web protocols to communicate between a requester and
a provider, allowing distributed computation across the
Internet with unpredictable data flows and latencies.
All metadata produced by the components is stored in
a central data repository, making it available to other
downstream technologies.
The system currently processes approximately 1,000
English newswire documents per day from a
commercial source, as well as 150 documents per day
from Arabic newspapers, obtained via web harvesting.
All Arabic documents are translated to English via
Machine Translation. The total flow of documents is
then exposed to all the other downstream technologies
(Fact Extraction, Document Clustering, and Multi-
document Summarization).

4 Recent Developments
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999755">
The TAP-XL system has been under development since
November of 2002, and was recently used by more than
12 analysts in an Integrated Feasibility Experiment
(IFE) under the DARPA TIDES program. The results of
this IFE will be used to guide future enhancements of
the TAP-XL system, including user interface
enhancements, use model improvements, and additional
language component technology.
