Cross-linguistic similarities are reflected
by the speech sound systems of languages
all over the world. In this work we try
to model such similarities observed in the
consonant inventories, through a complex
bipartite network. We present a systematic
study of some of the appealing features of
these inventories with the help of the bi-
partite network. An important observation
is that the occurrence of consonants fol-
lows a two regime power law distribution.
We find that the consonant inventory size
distribution together with the principle of
preferential attachment are the main rea-
sons behind the emergence of such a two
regime behavior. In order to further sup-
port our explanation we present a synthe-
sis model for this network based on the
general theory of preferential attachment.

Sound systems of the world’s languages show re-
markable regularities. Any arbitrary set of conso-
nants and vowels does not make up the sound sys-
tem of a particular language. Several lines of re-
search suggest that cross-linguistic similarities get
reflected in the consonant and vowel inventories
of the languages all over the world (Greenberg,
1966; Pinker, 1994; Ladefoged and Maddieson,
1996). Previously it has been argued that these
similarities are the results of certain general prin-
ciples like maximal perceptual contrast (Lindblom
and Maddieson, 1988), feature economy (Mar-
tinet, 1968; Boersma, 1998; Clements, 2004) and
robustness (Jakobson and Halle, 1956; Chomsky
and Halle, 1968). Maximal perceptual contrast
between the phonemes of a language is desir-
able for proper perception in a noisy environment.
In fact the organization of the vowel inventories
across languages has been satisfactorily explained
in terms of the single principle of maximal percep-
tual contrast (Jakobson, 1941; Wang, 1968).
There have been several attempts to reason
the observed patterns in consonant inventories
since 1930s (Trubetzkoy, 1969/1939; Lindblom
and Maddieson, 1988; Boersma, 1998; Flemming,
2002; Clements, 2004), but unlike the case of vow-
els, the structure of consonant inventories lacks a
complete and holistic explanation (de Boer, 2000).
Most of the works are confined to certain indi-
vidual principles (Abry, 2003; Hinskens and Wei-
jer, 2003) rather than formulating a general the-
ory describing the structural patterns and/or their
stability. Thus, the structure of the consonant in-
ventories continues to be a complex jigsaw puzzle,
though the parts and pieces are known.
In this work we attempt to represent the cross-
linguistic similarities that exist in the consonant
inventories of the world’s languages through a
bipartite network named PlaNet (the Phoneme
Language Network). PlaNet has two different sets
of nodes, one labeled by the languages while the
other labeled by the consonants. Edges run be-
tween these two sets depending on whether or not
a particular consonant occurs in a particular lan-
guage. This representation is motivated by similar
modeling of certain complex phenomena observed
in nature and society, such as,

between partitions depending on whether a
particular compound is a substrate or result
of a reaction (Jeong et al., 2000).

proved to be a comprehensive and emerging way
of capturing the underlying generating mecha-
nism of such systems (for a review on complex
networks and their generation see (Albert and
Barab´asi, 2002; Newman, 2003)). There have

cacies of human languages through complex net-
works. Word networks based on synonymy (Yook
et al., 2001b), co-occurrence (Cancho et al., 2001),
and phonemic edit-distance (Vitevitch, 2005) are
examples of such attempts. The present work also
uses the concept of complex networks to develop
a platform for a holistic analysis as well as synthe-
sis of the distribution of the consonants across the
languages.
In the current work, with the help of PlaNet we
provide a systematic study of certain interesting
features of the consonant inventories. An impor-
tant property that we observe is the two regime
power law degree distribution1 of the nodes la-
beled by the consonants. We try to explain this
property in the light of the size of the consonant
inventories coupled with the principle ofpreferen-
tial attachment (Barab´asi and Albert, 1999). Next
we present a simplified mathematical model ex-
plaining the emergence of the two regimes. In or-
der to support our analytical explanations, we also
provide a synthesis model for PlaNet.
The rest of the paper is organized into five sec-
tions. In section 2 we formally define PlaNet, out-
line its construction procedure and present some
studies on its degree distribution. We dedicate sec-
tion 3 to state and explain the inferences that can

We define the network of consonants and lan-
guages, PlaNet, as a bipartite graph represented as
G = (VL, VC, E) where VL is the set of nodes la-
beled by the languages and VC is the set of nodes
labeled by the consonants. E is the set of edges
that run between VL and VC. There is an edge e E
E between two nodes vl E VL and v, E VC if and
only if the consonant c occurs in the language l.

Many typological studies (Lindblom and Mad-
dieson, 1988; Ladefoged and Maddieson, 1996;
Hinskens and Weijer, 2003) of segmental inven-
tories have been carried out in past on the UCLA
Phonological Segment Inventory Database (UP-
SID) (Maddieson, 1984). UPSID initially had 317
languages and was later extended to include 451
languages covering all the major language families
of the world. In this work we have used the older
version of UPSID comprising of 317 languages
and 541 consonants (henceforth UPSID317), for
constructing PlaNet. Consequently, there are 317
elements (nodes) in the set VL and 541 elements

(nodes) in the set VC. The number of elements
(edges) in the set E as computed from PlaNet is
7022. At this point it is important to mention that
in order to avoid any confusion in the construc-
tion of PlaNet we have appropriately filtered out
the anomalous and the ambiguous segments (Mad-
dieson, 1984) from it. We have completely ig-
nored the anomalous segments from the data set
(since the existence of such segments is doubtful),
and included the ambiguous ones as separate seg-
ments because there are no descriptive sources ex-
plaining how such ambiguities might be resolved.
A similar approach has also been described in Per-
icliev and Vald´es-P´erez (2002).

2.2 Degree Distribution of PlaNet
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98265193220339">
The degree of a node u, denoted by ku is defined as
the number of edges connected to u. The term de-
gree distribution is used to denote the way degrees
(ku) are distributed over the nodes (u). The de-
gree distribution studies find a lot of importance in
understanding the complex topology of any large
network, which is very difficult to visualize oth-
erwise. Since PlaNet is bipartite in nature it has
two degree distribution curves one corresponding
to the nodes in the set VL and the other corre-
sponding to the nodes in the set VC.
Degree distribution of the nodes in VL: Fig-
ure 2 shows the degree distribution of the nodes
in VL where the x-axis denotes the degree of each
node expressed as a fraction of the maximum de-
gree and the y-axis denotes the number of nodes
having a given degree expressed as a fraction of
the total number of nodes in VL .
It is evident from Figure 2 that the number of
consonants appearing in different languages fol-
low a Q-distribution 2 (see (Bulmer, 1979) for ref-
erence). The figure shows an asymmetric right
skewed distribution with the values of α and Q
equal to 7.06 and 47.64 (obtained using maximum
likelihood estimation method) respectively. The
asymmetry points to the fact that languages usu-
ally tend to have smaller consonant inventory size,

parameters α &gt; 0 and ,3 &gt; 0 if and only if its probability mass

gamma function.

the best value being somewhere between 10 and
30. The distribution peaks roughly at 21 indicating
that majority of the languages in UPSID317 have a
consonant inventory size of around 21 consonants.
Degree distribution of the nodes in VC: Fig-
ure 3 illustrates two different types of degree dis-
tribution plots for the nodes in VC; Figure 3(a)
corresponding to the rank, i.e., the sorted order of
degrees, (x-axis) versus degree (y-axis) and Fig-
ure 3(b) corresponding to the degree (k) (x-axis)
versus Pk (y-axis) where Pk is the fraction of
nodes having degree greater than or equal to k.
Figure 3 clearly shows that both the curves have
two distinct regimes and the distribution is scale-
free. Regime 1 in Figure 3(a) consists of 21 con-
sonants which have a very high frequency (i.e.,
the degree k) of occurrence. Regime 2 of Fig-
ure 3(b) also correspond to these 21 consonants.
On the other hand Regime 2 of Figure 3(a) as well
as Regime 1 of Figure 3(b) comprises of the rest
of the consonants. The point marked as z in both
the figures indicates the breakpoint. Each of the
regime in both Figure 3(a) and (b) exhibit a power

It becomes necessary to mention here that such
power law distributions, known variously as Zipf’s
law (Zipf, 1949), are also observed in an extra-
ordinarily diverse range of phenomena including
the frequency of the use of words in human lan-
guage (Zipf, 1949), the number of papers scien-
tists write (Lotka, 1926), the number of hits on
web pages (Adamic and Huberman, 2000) and so
on. Thus our inferences, detailed out in the next
section, mainly centers around this power law be-
havior.

3 Inferences Drawn from the Analysis of
PlaNet
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99884820754717">
In most of the networked systems like the society,
the Internet, the World Wide Web, and many oth-
ers, power law degree distribution emerges for the
phenomenon of preferential attachment, i.e., when
“the rich get richer” (Simon, 1955). With refer-
ence to PlaNet this preferential attachment can be
interpreted as the tendency of a language to choose
a consonant that has been already chosen by a
large number of other languages. We posit that it is
this preferential property of languages that results
in the power law degree distributions observed in
Figure 3(a) and (b).
Nevertheless there is one question that still re-
mains unanswered. Whereas the power law distri-
bution is well understood, the reason for the two
distinct regimes (with a sharp break) still remains
unexplored. We hypothesize that,
Hypothesis The typical distribution of the conso-
nant inventory size over languages coupled with
the principle of preferential attachment enforces
the two distinct regimes to appear in the power
law curves.
As the average consonant inventory size in
UPSID317 is 21, so following the principle of
preferential attachment, on an average, the first
21 most frequent consonants are much more pre-
ferred than the rest. Consequently, the nature of
the frequency distribution for the highly frequent
consonants is different from the less frequent ones,
and hence there is a transition from Regime 1 to
Regime 2 in the Figure 3(a) and (b).
Support Experiment: In order to establish that
the consonant inventory size plays an important
role in giving rise to the two regimes discussed
above we present a support experiment in which
we try to observe whether the breakpoint x shifts
as we shift the average consonant inventory size.
Experiment: In order to shift the average con-
sonant inventory size from 21 to 25, 30 and 38
we neglected the contribution of the languages
with consonant inventory size less than n where
n is 15, 20 and 25 respectively and subsequently
recorded the degree distributions obtained each
time. We did not carry out our experiments for
average consonant inventory size more than 38 be-
cause the number of such languages are very rare
in UPSID317.
Observations: Figure 4 shows the effect of this
shifting of the average consonant inventory size on
the rank versus degree distribution curves. Table 2
presents the results observed from these curves
with the left column indicating the average inven-
tory size and the right column the breakpoint x.

The table clearly indicates that the transition oc-

Inferences: It is quite evident from our observa-
tions that the breakpoint x has a strong correlation
with the average consonant inventory size, which
therefore plays a key role in the emergence of the
two regime degree distribution curves.
In the next section we provide a simplistic math-
ematical model for explaining the two regime
power law with a breakpoint corresponding to the
average consonant inventory size.

Regimes

Let us assume that the inventory of all the lan-
guages comprises of 21 consonants. We further as-
sume that the consonants are arranged in their hier-
archy of preference. A language traverses the hier-
archy of consonants and at every step decides with
a probability p to choose the current consonant. It
stops as soon as it has chosen all the 21 conso-
nants. Since languages must traverse through the
first 21 consonants regardless of whether the pre-
vious consonants are chosen or not, the probability
of choosing any one of these 21 consonants must
be p. But the case is different for the 22nd conso-
nant, which is chosen by a language if it has pre-
viously chosen zero, one, two, or at most 20, but
tained for
This is indicative of the fact that
languages choose consonants from the hierarchy
with a probability function comparable to P(n).
Owing to the simplified assumption that all
the languages have only 21 consonants, the first
regime is a straight line; however we believe a
more rigorous mathematical model can be built
taking into consideration the
rather
than just the mean value of the inventory size that
can explain the negative slope of the first regime.
We look forward to do the same as a part of our
work. Rather, here we try to investigate the ef-
fect of the exact distribution of the language inven-
tory size on the nature of the degree distribution of
the consonants through a synthetic approach based

a model based on these two ingredients repro-
duces the observed stationary scale-free distrib-
utions, which in turn indicates that the develop-
ment of large networks is governed by robust self-
organizing phenomena that go beyond the particu-
lars of the individual systems.
Inspired by their work and the empirical as well
as the mathematical analysis presented above, we
propose a preferential attachment model for syn-
thesizing PlaNet (PlaNetsyn henceforth) in which
the degree distribution of the nodes in VL is
known. Hence VL={L1, L2, . . ., L3171 have
degrees (consonant inventory size) {k1, k2, . . .,
k3171 respectively. We assume that the nodes in
the set VC are unlabeled. At each time step, a
node Lj (j = 1 to 317) from VL tries to attach itself
with a new node i E VC to which it is not already
connected. The probability Pr(i) with which the
node Lj gets attached to i depends on the current
degree of i and is given by

where ki is the current degree of the node i, Vj
is the set of nodes in VC to which Lj is not al-
ready connected and E is the smoothing parameter
which is used to reduce bias and favor at least a
few attachments with nodes in Vj that do not have
a high Pr(i). The above process is repeated un-
til all Lj E VL get connected to exactly kj nodes
in VC. The entire idea is summarized in Algo-
rithm 1. Figure 6 shows a partial step of the syn-
thesis process illustrated in Algorithm 1.

We believe that the general explanation pro-
vided here for the two regime power law is a fun-
damental result, and can have a far reaching im-
pact, because two regime behavior is observed in
many other networked systems.
Until now we have been mainly dealing with the
computational aspects of the distribution of conso-
nants over the languages rather than exploring the
real world dynamics that gives rise to such a distri-
bution. An issue that draws immediate attention is
that how preferential attachment, which is a gen-
eral phenomenon associated with network evolu-
tion, can play a prime role in shaping the conso-
nant inventories of the world’s languages. The an-
swer perhaps is hidden in the fact that language is
an evolving system and its present structure is de-
termined by its past evolutionary history. Indeed
an explanation based on this evolutionary model,
with an initial disparity in the distribution of con-
sonants over languages, can be intuitively verified
as follows – let there be a language community
of N speakers communicating among themselves
by means of only two consonants say /�/ and /g/.
If we assume that every speaker has l descendants
and language inventories are transmitted with high
fidelity, then after i generations it is expected that
the community will consist of mlz /�/ speakers and
nlz /g/ speakers. Now if m &gt; n and l &gt; 1, then for
sufficiently large i, mlz » nlz. Stated differently,
the /�/ speakers by far outnumbers the /g/ speak-
ers even if initially the number of /�/ speakers is
only slightly higher than that of the /g/ speakers.
This phenomenon is similar to that of preferen-
tial attachment where language communities get
attached to, i.e., select, consonants that are already
highly preferred. Nevertheless, it remains to be
seen where from such an initial disparity in the dis-
tribution of the consonants over languages might
have originated.
In this paper, we mainly dealt with the occur-
rence principles of the consonants in the invento-
ries of the world’s languages. The work can be fur-
ther extended to identify the co-occurrence likeli-
hood of the consonants in the language inventories

and subsequently identify the groups or commu-
nities within them. Information about such com-
munities can then help in providing an improved
insight about the organizing principles of the con-
sonant inventories.

<abstract confidence="0.99722995">Cross-linguistic similarities are reflected by the speech sound systems of languages all over the world. In this work we try to model such similarities observed in the consonant inventories, through a complex bipartite network. We present a systematic study of some of the appealing features of these inventories with the help of the bipartite network. An important observation is that the occurrence of consonants follows a two regime power law distribution. We find that the consonant inventory size distribution together with the principle of preferential attachment are the main reasons behind the emergence of such a two regime behavior. In order to further support our explanation we present a synthesis model for this network based on the general theory of preferential attachment.</abstract>

Thus our inferences, detailed out in the next section, mainly centers around this power law behavior. 3 Inferences Drawn from the Analysis of PlaNet In most of the networked systems like the society, the Internet, the World Wide Web, and many others, power law degree distribution emerges for the phenomenon of preferential attachment, i.e., when “the rich get richer” (Simon, 1955). With reference to PlaNet this preferential attachment can be interpreted as the tendency of a language to choose a consonant that has been already chosen by a large number of other languages.

UPSID initially had 317 languages and was later extended to include 451 languages covering all the major language families of the world. In this work we have used the older version of UPSID comprising of 317 languages and 541 consonants (henceforth UPSID317), for constructing PlaNet. Consequently, there are 317 elements (nodes) in the set VL and 541 elements 129 (nodes) in the set VC. The number of elements (edges) in the set E as computed from PlaNet is 7022. </context>

With reference to PlaNet this preferential attachment can be interpreted as the tendency of a language to choose a consonant that has been already chosen by a large number of other languages. We posit that it is this preferential property of languages that results in the power law degree distributions observed in Figure 3(a) and (b). Nevertheless there is one question that still remains unanswered. Whereas the power law distribution is well understood, the reason for the two distinct regimes (with a sharp break) still remains unexplored.

Modeling of complex systems as networks has proved to be a comprehensive and emerging way of capturing the underlying generating mechanism of such systems (for a review on complex networks and their generation see (Albert and Barab´asi, 2002; Newman, 2003)). There have been some attempts as well to model the intricacies of human languages through complex networks. Word networks based on synonymy (Yook et al., 2001b), co-occurrence (Cancho et al., 2001), and phonemic edit-distance (Vitevitch, 2005) are examples of such attempts. The present work also uses the concept of complex networks to develop a platform for a holistic analysis as well as synthesis of the distribution of the consonants across the languages. In the current work, with the help of PlaNet we provide a systematic study of certain interesting features of the consonant inventories. An important property that we observe is the two regime power law degree distribution1 of the nodes labeled by the consonants. We try to explain this property in the light of the size of the consonant inventories coupled with the principle ofpre</context>

Maximal perceptual contrast between the phonemes of a language is desirable for proper perception in a noisy environment. In fact the organization of the vowel inventories across languages has been satisfactorily explained in terms of the single principle of maximal perceptual contrast (Jakobson, 1941; Wang, 1968). There have been several attempts to reason the observed patterns in consonant inventories since 1930s (Trubetzkoy, 1969/1939; Lindblom and Maddieson, 1988; Boersma, 1998; Flemming, 2002; Clements, 2004), but unlike the case of vowels, the structure of consonant inventories lacks a complete and holistic explanation (de Boer, 2000). Most of the works are confined to certain individual principles (Abry, 2003; Hinskens and Weijer, 2003) rather than formulating a general theory describing the structural patterns and/or their stability. Thus, the structure of the consonant inventories continues to</context>

Thus our inferences, detailed out in the next section, mainly centers around this power law behavior. 3 Inferences Drawn from the Analysis of PlaNet In most of the networked systems like the society, the Internet, the World Wide Web, and many others, power law degree distribution emerges for the phenomenon of preferential attachm</context>
