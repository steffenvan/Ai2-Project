It is traditionally assumed that various
sources of linguistic knowledge and their in-
teraction should be formalised in order to
be able to convert words into their phone-
mic representations with reasonable accu-
racy. We show that using supervised learn-
ing techniques, based on a corpus of tran-
scribed words, the same and even better
performance can be achieved, without ex-
plicit modeling of linguistic knowledge.
In this paper we present two instances of
this approach. A first model implements a
variant of instance-based learning, in which
a weighed similarity metric and a database
of prototypical exemplars are used to pre-
dict new mappings. In the second model,
grapheme-to-phoneme mappings are looked
up in a compressed text-to-speech lexicon
(table lookup) enriched with default map-
pings. We compare performance and accu-
racy of these approaches to a connectionist
(backpropagation) approach and to the lin-

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999931531914894">
Grapheme-to-phoneme conversion is a central task
in any text-to-speech (reading aloud) system. Given
an alphabet of spelling symbols (graphemes) and
an alphabet of phonetic symbols, a mapping should
be achieved transliterating strings of graphemes into
strings of phonetic symbols. It is well known that
this mapping is difficult because in general, not all
graphemes are realised in the phonetic transcription,
and the same grapheme may correspond to different
phonetic symbols, depending on context.
It is traditionally assumed that various sources of
linguistic knowledge and their interaction should be
formalised in order to be able to convert words into
their phonemic representations with reasonable accu-
racy. Although different researchers propose differ-
ent knowledge structures, consensus seems to be that
at least morphological and phonotactic knowledge
should be incorporated in order to be able to find
morphological and syllable structure. These struc-
tures are deemed necessary to define the proper do-
mains for phonological and phonetic rules. As a typi-
cal architecture for grapheme-to-phoneme conversion
in Dutch, consider the modules in [Daelemans, 1988]
shown in Figure 1. It contains most of the traditional
datastructures and processing components proposed
by computational linguists.
A problem with this approach is that the knowl-
edge needed is highly language-dependent and re-
quires a significant amount of linguistic engineer-
ing. We argue that using data-oriented learning tech-
niques on a corpus of transcribed words (information.
which is readily available in many machine-readable
dictionaries), the same and even better performance
can be achieved, without explicit modeling of linguis-
tic knowledge. The advantages of such an approach
are that the technique is reusable for different sets
of data (e.g. different languages or sublanguages),
and that it is automatic (no explicit linguistic engi-
neering is needed to handcraft the rules and knowl-
edge structures necessary for implementing the tar-
get mapping).
In this paper we present two instances of this
approach in the domain of Grapheme-to-Phoneme
conversion. A first model implements a variant of
instance-based learning, in which a similarity metric
(weighed by using a metric based on information en-
tropy) and a database of prototypical exemplars are

used to predict new mappings. In a second model,
grapheme-to-phoneme mappings are looked up in a
compressed text-to-speech lexicon (table lookup) en-
riched with default mappings. The most surprising
result of our research is that the simplest method
(based on tables and defaults) yields the best gener-
alisation results, suggesting that previous knowledge-
based approaches to the problem were overkill. For
the case of Dutch, we make a comparison of perfor-
mance and accuracy of these approaches to a connec-
tionist (backpropagation) approach and to a state-
of-the-art linguistic knowledge-based approach. To
prove reusability of the method, we show how our
approach can also be used for automatically gener-
ating French and English phonemisation modules.

The algorithms we have applied in our research are
similarity-based and data-oriented. The phonemisa-
tion problem is interpreted as a classification task.
Given a target grapheme and its context, the cor-
responding phoneme should be predicted. The al-
gorithms we used to learn this task are supervised
and data-intensive in the sense that a large num-
ber of examples is provided of input representations
with their correct category (in this case a phonetic
transcription). Within a supervised, similarity-based
approach, the degree in which abstractions are ex-
tracted from the examples may be different, as may
be the time when abstractions are created: dur-
ing training in aggressive abstraction, during perfor-
mance in lazy learning. For grapheme-to-phoneme
conversion, we claim a data-intensive, lazy learning
approach is appropriate to capture the intricate in-
teractions between regularities, subregularities, and
exceptions that characterise the domain.

2.1 Training and Test Set Encoding
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.973741516129032">
Training and test set were randomly selected from
a Dutch text-to-speech vocabulary data base. From
the 70,000 word dataset, 20,000 were randomly se-
lected and randomly divided into 18,500 training
words and 1,500 test words. In both sets, each
graphemic word is accompanied by its pronuncia-
tion in the form of a string of phonemes. In cases
where phonemes correspond to grapheme clusters
(i.e. there is an alignment problem of grapheme
strings with their corresponding phoneme strings), as
is the case in, e.g., &lt;schoenen&gt; (shoes) /sxung/, one
grapheme of that cluster is algorithmically mapped
to the phoneme, and the remaining graphemes are
mapped to phonetic nulls, represented by hyphens.
In the example of &lt;schoenen&gt;, this phonetic null in-
sertion results in the following alignment:

To provide a learning system with sufficient informa-
tion about the phonemisation task, context informa-
tion must be added. In the models described below,
this is done by using graphemic windows (compare
[Sejnowski and Rosenberg, 19871), i.e. fixed-length
parts of words in which one grapheme is mapped
to a phoneme; the other graphemes serve as con-
text. For example, using a window with one left
context grapheme and two right context graphemes
(from here on written as `1-1-2&apos;), the application of
this window on the word &lt;boek&gt; (book), pronounced
as /buk/, would result in the four pattern-category
pairs of Table 1.

2.2 Instance-Based Learning
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99995765625">
As an example of a lazy learning approach, we exper-
imented with Instance-Based Learning (IBL, [Aha et
al., 1991]). IBL is a framework and methodology
for incremental supervised machine learning. The
distinguishing feature of IBL is the fact that no ex-
plicit abstractions are constructed on the basis of the
training examples during the training phase. A se-
lection of the training items themselves is used to
classify new inputs. IBL shares with Memory-Based
Reasoning (MBR, [Stanfill and Waltz, 1986]) and
Case-Based Reasoning (CBR, [Riesbeck and Schank,
1989]) the hypothesis that much of intelligent be-
haviour is based on the immediate use of stored
episodes of earlier experience rather than on the use
of explicitly constructed abstractions extracted from
this experience (e.g. in the form of rules or decision
trees). In the present context of learning linguis-
tic mappings, the hypothesis would be that much of
language behaviour is based on this type of memory-
based processing rather than on rule-based process-
ing. In linguistics, a similar emphasis on analogy to
stored examples instead of explicit but inaccessible
rules, is present in the work of a.o. [Derwing and
Skousen, 1989]. IBL is inspired to some extent on
psychological research on exemplar-based categori-
sation (as opposed to classical and probabilistic cat-
egorisation, [Smith and Medin, 1981]). Finally, as far
as algorithms are concerned, IBL finds its inspiration
in statistical pattern recognition, especially the rich
research tradition on the nearest-neighbour decision
rule (see e.g. [Devijver and Kittler, 1982], for an
overview).

2.2.1 Basic Algorithm and Extensions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999990757575758">
The main datastructure in our version of IBL is
the exemplar, a memory structure representing about
each pattern the following information: (i) Its distri-
bution over the different categories (training patterns
may be ambiguous between different categories, so
the memory structure should keep information about
how many times each category was assigned to a par-
ticular pattern). (ii) Its category. This is simply the
category with highest frequency in the distribution of
a pattern, or a random selection to break a tie. (iii)
Other bookkeeping information (performance data,
frequency of pattern in training set, etc.)
Training. For each training pattern, it is checked
whether an exemplar for it is already present in mem-
ory. If this is the case, the frequency of its category
is incremented in the distribution field of the corre-
sponding memory structure. If the new training item
has not yet been stored in memory, a new memory
structure is created. In learning linguistic mappings
(a noisy domain), learning in IBL often is helped
by forgetting poorly performing or unrepresentative
training items. In this research a simple technique
was used to prune memory: each new training item
is first classified using the memory structures already
present. If it is categorised correctly, it is skipped.
We have experimented also with more elaborate stor-
age saving techniques (based on prototypicality and
performance of training patterns), but the results are
preliminary and will not be reported here.
Testing. If the test pattern is present in memory,
the category with the highest frequency associated
with it is used. If it is not in memory, all memory
items are sorted according to the similarity of their
pattern to the test pattern. The (most frequent)
category of the highest ranking exemplar is then pre-
dicted as category of the test pattern. When using a
Euclidean distance metric (geometrical distance be-
tween two patterns in pattern space), all features are
interpreted as being equally important. But this is
of course not necessarily the case. We extended the
basic IBL algorithm proposed by [Aha et al., 1991]
with a technique for assigning a different importance
to different features. Our approach to the problem of
weighing the relative importance of features is based
on the concept of Information Gain (IG), also used
in learning inductive decision trees, [Quinlan, 1986],
and first introduced (as far as we know) in IBL in
[Daelemans and Van den Bosch, 1992] in the con-
text of a syllable segmentation task. The idea is to
interpret the training set as an information source
capable of generating a number of messages (the dif-
ferent categories) with a certain probability. The in-
formation entropy of such an information source can
be compared in turn for each feature to the average
information entropy of the information source when
the value of that feature is known. The difference
is the IG value for that feature. The (normalised)
IG value is used as a weight for that feature during
similarity matching. Figure 2 shows the pattern of
information-gain values for the different positions in
the 2-1-3 grapheme window. Unsurprisingly, the tar-
get grapheme is most informative, and context fea-
tures become less informative the further they are
removed from the target. We also found that right
context is more informative than left context (com-
pare [Weijters, 1991]).

2.3 Table Lookup with Defaults
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999986307692308">
Our table lookup model can be seen as a link between
straightforward lexical lookup and similarity-based
reasoning. Lexical lookup of word-pronunciation
pairs has various disadvantages, an important one
being that this approach only works for the words
that are stored in the lexicon and not for new words.
Without the possibility of manipulating graphemic
strings smaller than whole words, there is no way
that lexical lookup can provide generalisations on the
basis of which new words can be transliterated.
The table lookup model presented here takes as
its training set a text-to-speech lexicon, but solves
the problems of lacking generalisation power and effi-

ciency by compressing it into a text-to-speech lookup
table. The main strategy behind the model is to dy-
namically determine which left and right contexts are
minimally sufficient to be able to map a grapheme
to the correct phoneme with absolute certaintyl
The context needed to disambiguate a grapheme-
to-phoneme mapping can be of very different width.
Extreme examples in Dutch are on the one hand the
c-cedille, present in a small number of loan words
(e.g., &lt;recu&gt;), always pronounced as /s/ regardless
of left or right context, and on the other hand the
&lt;c&gt;, which can map to various phonemes (e.g., /9/,
/c/, /e/) in various contexts. For example, the dis-
ambiguation of the pronunciation of the final &lt;e&gt; in
words ending with &lt;-ster&gt; (either star or female pro-
fession suffix) sometimes involves taking into account
large left contexts, as in the examples &lt;venster&gt;
(window) and &lt;dienster&gt; (servant), in which the fi-
nal &lt;c&gt; is pronounced /a/, versus &lt;morgenster&gt;
(morning star), in which the final &lt;e&gt; is pronounced
/c/. To disambiguate between these three cases, it
is necessary to go back five positions in these words
to find the first grapheme which the words do not
have in common.
Table Construction. The algorithm starts by
searching for all unambiguous one-to-one grapheme-
phoneme mappings, and storing these mappings
(patterns) in the lookup table, more specifically in
the 0-1-0 subtable. The few unambiguous 0-1-0 pat-
terns in our training set include the &lt;c&gt; - /s/ case
mentioned earlier. The next step of the algorithm
is to extend the width of the graphemic window by

respondence does only express the fact that that cor-
respondence is unambiguous in the training set of the
model.
one character. We chose to start by extending the
window on the right (i.e., a 0-1-1 window), because,
as also reflected earlier in the Information Gain met-
ric used in the IBL model, right context appears to
contain slightly more valuable information than the
equivalent left context2 . The algorithm then searches
for all certain 0-1-1 patterns to store in the 0-1-1
subtable. Compression is achieved because exten-
sions of unambiguous patterns in the 0-1-0 subtable
do not have to be stored in the 0-1-1 subtable. This
procedure of extending the window and storing all
certain patterns that have not been stored earlier is
then repeated (extending 0-1-1 to 1-1-1, then to 1-
1-2, etc.), and stops when the whole training corpus
is compressed in the lookup table, and all grapheme-
phoneme mappings in the corpus are supplied with
sufficient left and right contexts. The model eval-
uated below is calculated up to the 5-1-5 window.
At that point, the lookup table covers 99.5% of all
grapheme-phoneme mappings in the training set. As
a measure of the amount of compression, in number
of bytes, the size of the set of linked tables (including
the default table discussed below) is 5.8% of the size
of the part of the lexicon used as training set3.
Figure 3 displays the magnitudes of the subtables.
It can clearly be seen that most ambiguity is resolved
with relatively small contexts. The majority of the
ambiguity in the training set is already resolved at
the 2-1-2 subtable, after which further extension of
window width gradually decreases the number of
stored patterns (i.e., resolved ambiguities).
Retrieval. The pronunciation of a word can be re-
trieved by taking each grapheme of that word sepa-
rately, and searching in the lookup table for a match-
ing graphemic pattern. First, the grapheme is looked
up in the 0-1-0 subtable. If it does not match with
any graphemic pattern stored in that table, the sin-
gle grapheme pattern is extended to a 0-1-1 pattern.
This procedure is then repeated until a matching
pattern with a minimal context is found, returning
a &apos;certain&apos; grapheme-phoneme mapping. After all
graphemes have been processed this way, the phone-
mic mappings are concatenated to form the pronun-
ciation of the word.
An example of retrieving the pronunciation of a
word by table lookup is given in Table 2. As this
example illustrates, the contexts needed for disam-
biguating between output categories are generally
very small.
&apos;The fact that Information Gain reflects this asym-
metry, led us to a new, more generic and domain-
independent, conceptualisation and implementation of
the Table Lookup method, in which context features are
ordered according to their information gain, and patterns
are stored in a single trie instead of in separate tables.

<bodyText confidence="0.999914714285714">
In case of unseen test words that contain grapheme
patterns not present in the training set, the lookup
algorithm will not be able to retrieve that specific
mapping. This problem is handled in our model by
adding to the lookup table a second table which con-
tains all occurring graphemic patterns in the training
set of a fixed window width (1-1-1), coupled with
their most frequently occurring (default) phonemic
mapping. Whenever lookup table retrieval fails and
a match can be found between the test pattern and
a 1-1-1 default pattern, this default table provides a
&apos;best guess&apos; which in many cases still turns out to be
correct. To cover for those particular cases where no
matching can be found between the test pattern and
the 1-1-1 default patterns, a small third default table
is added to the model, containing for each grapheme
its most frequently occurring phonemic mapping re-
gardless of context (0-1-0), returning a &apos;final guess&apos;.
It is important to see that generalisation in this
approach arises from two different mechanisms: (i)
the fact that spellings of different words contain iden-
tical grapheme substrings, and (ii) the default tables
which reflect probabilities of mappings in the train-
ing set. More sophisticated reasoning methods can
be used instead of the default table: at present we are
investigating the consequences of substituting case-
based reasoning such as implemented in IBL for the
present default tables.

To get a better insight into the performance of our

it to the performance of a &apos;classical&apos; data-oriented
method (backpropagation learning in feed-forward
nets), and to the linguistic knowledge-based ap-

3.1 An Alternative Data-Oriented
Approach: Connectionism
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999949555555555">
In IBL, explicit use is made of similarity-based rea-
soning. A similarity metric is used to compare items,
and the items most similar to a test item are taken as
a basis for making a decision about the category of
the latter. Backpropagation learning in feedforward
connectionist networks (BP), too, uses similarity (or
analogy), but more implicitly. Again, an input pat-
tern activates an output pattern which is similar to
the activation pattern of those items that are sim-
ilar to the new item. Complexity is added by the
fact that an intermediate hidden layer of units &amp;quot;re-
defines&amp;quot; similarity by extracting features from the
activation patterns of the input layer. (In our ver-
sion of IBL, the information gain metric is used to
achieve a similar result).
Automatic learning of grapheme-phoneme conver-
sion of English (NETtalk, [Sejnowski and Rosenberg,
1987]) has been acclaimed as a success story for BP.
The approach was replicated for Dutch in NetSpraak
([Weijters and Hoppenbrouwers, 1990]). It is there-
fore appropriate to compare our two data-oriented
models to BP. The main reason for experimenting
with BP for learning complex linguistic mappings
is that BP networks are alleged to be able to ex-
tract generalisations and sub-generalisations from
their training data, as well as store exceptions to
these generalisations. However, there are limitations
to BP network capabilities. BP learning is not guar-
anteed to converge to optimal performance (i.e. it
can end up in local minima). A consequence of this
is that although a multi-layered network may be able
in principle to represent the solution to any mapping
problem, this property is not of much help because
the designer of such a network is confronted with
a large search space of variable network parameters

the network considerably, but which cannot be deter-
mined by rule. Experimenters can therefore almost
never be sure that their results are optimal.
We trained BP networks on grapheme-phoneme
conversion using a training set which was restricted,
for computational reasons, to all unique 2-1-3 map-
pings present in the original training set, removing
frequency information, but also removing a large por-
tion of redundancy inherent in the original training
set. The same test set was used as with IBL and
the table lookup model. Graphemes were encoded
by assigning each letter a randomly generated 6-
bit string; phonemes were encoded locally, i.e., each
phoneme was represented by a 46-bit string with only
one phoneme-specific bit &apos;on&apos;. Systematic simula-
tions were used to approach optimal hidden layer
size (60 units), learning rate (0.05) and momentum
(0.4). With these parameter settings, 5 networks
were randomly initialised (weights were assigned ran-
dom values between -0.5 and 0.5) and trained for
100 epochs4. The performance result listed below
was calculated by averaging the performance scores
of these 5 networks on the test set.

In MORPA-CUM-MORPHON ([Nunn and Van
Heuven, 1993]), a state-of-the-art system for Dutch,
grapheme-phoneme conversion is done in two steps.
First, MORPA alleemskerk and Van Heuven, 19931)
decomposes a word into a list of morphemes. These
morphemes are looked up in a lexicon. Each mor-
pheme is associated with its category and a phone-
mic transcription. The phonemic transcriptions of
the consecutive morphemes are concatenated to form
an underlying phonemic representation of the word.
MORPHON then applies a number of phonological
rules to this underlying representation, deriving the
surface pronunciation of the word.
In [Nunn and Van Heuven, 1993], test data is
referred to with which they evaluated their sys-
tem. We applied the table-lookup method to the
same test data in order to make a comparison pos-
sible. The test file consists of 1,971 words from var-
ious sources: newspaper text, compounds, and low-
frequency words. High-frequency words, acronyms,
and proper names were removed from the original
data set. As we did not try to solve the stress as-
signment problem in this experiment, we had to re-
compute the error given by [Nunn and Van Heuven,
19931 such that stress assignment or syllable struc-
ture errors were not taken into account5.
The table lookup model was reconstructed on
the basis of the complete 70,000 word-pronunciation
pairs in our Dutch corpus, resulting in a model con-
taining 48,000 patterns (including default tables).

In the knowledge-based approach, errors of mor-
phological analysis (spurious ambiguity or no anal-
ysis) account for a considerable amount of incorrect
phoneme output (even after removal by [Nunn and
Van Heuven, 1993] of proper names and other diffi-
cult cases from the test set). A new data-oriented
version of MORPA ([lleemskerk, 1993]) assigns a pri-
ority ordering to the set of morphological decom-

plied the IBL approach and two other data-oriented algo-
rithms, analogical modeling and backprop, to the stress
assignment problem (see [Gillis et al., 1992], [Daelemans
et at., 1993], but we have not yet tried to combine the
two tasks.

positions, based on a probabilistic grammar derived
from a corpus of examples of correct decompositions.
This new approach raises the overall performance
of MORPA-CUM-MORPHON to 88.7%, which remains
slightly worse than the table method.
On the basis of an analysis of confusion matri-
ces (misclassifications per grapheme), we find that
the same types of errors are made by both systems,
mainly on vowels (especially on the transcription of
grapheme &lt;e&gt;), but less frequently by the table
method. E.g. an intended /a/ was assigned cate-
gory /c/ 112 times by MORPA-CUM-MORPHON, and
only 23 times by the table method. Another dif-
ference is that while confusions by the table method
are symmetric, confusions in MORPA-CUM-MORPHON
seem to be directed (e.g. an intended /a/ is often
misclassified as /c/, but almost never the other way
round).

As mentioned earlier, Instance-Based Learning is a
form of case-based reasoning: a set of exemplars
(cases) and a similarity metric are used to make de-
cisions about unseen cases. Earlier work on the ap-
plication of Memory-Based Reasoning ([Stanfill and
Waltz, 1986; Stanfill, 1987]) (another form of case-
based reasoning) to the phonemisation problem using
the NetTalk data (MBRTalk), showed a better per-
formance than NetTalk itself ([Sejnowski and Rosen-
berg, 1987]), however at the cost of an expensive,
domain-dependent computational measure of dissim-
ilarity that seems to be computationally feasible only
when working on a massive parallel computer like the
Connection Machine. The Information Gain metric
we use in our version of IBL is domain-independent
and can be efficiently computed. Another case-based
system (or rather a hybrid combination of case-based
reasoning and relaxation in a localist interactive ac-
tivation network) is PRO aLehnert, 1987]). The re-
ported performance of this system is not very con-
vincing, however, neither is the need for a combina-
tion of connectionist and case-based techniques ap-
parent. Dietterich and Bakiri ([1991]) systematically
compared the performance of ID3 ([Quinlan, 1986])
and BP on the NetTalk data. Their conclusion is
that BP consistently outperforms ID3 because the
former captures statistical information that the lat-
ter does not. However, they demonstrate that ID3
can be extended to capture this statistical informa-
tion. Dietterich and Bakiri suggest that there is still
substantial room for improvement in learning meth-
ods for text-to-speech mapping, and it is indeed the
case that our approach significantly outperforms BP.
The application of compression techniques like our
table method to the phonemisation problem has not
yet been reported on as such in the literature. In
[Golding and Rosenbloom, 1991], the interaction of
rule-based reasoning and case-based reasoning in
the task of pronouncing surnames is studied. It
is claimed that a hybrid approach is preferable, in
which the output of the rules is used unless a com-
pelling analogy exist in the case-base. If a compelling
analogy is found, it overrides the rule output. In this
approach, the (hand-crafted) rules are interpreted as
implementing the defaults, and the cases the pockets
of exceptions. Our table-method works along a differ-
ent dimension: both default mappings and pockets
of exceptions are represented in both the table and
the default mapping (which as we suggested earlier,
we have replaced in the current version by case-based
reasoning). Certain mappings are present in the ta-
ble (which can be interpreted as an automatically ac-
quired rule set), and uncertain cases are handled by
the case-base (or default mapping). Future research
should make clearer how these two uses of case-based
reasoning are related and whether the strengths of
both can be combined.

4.2 Multi-lingual Grapheme-to-Phoneme
Conversion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999994911764706">
To test the reusability of our algorithms to
grapheme-to-phoneme conversion in different lan-
guages, we applied the table lookup approach to En-
glish and French data. For English, we used the
benchmark NetTalk corpus as used in [Sejnowski and
Rosenberg, 1987]. For French, we extracted word-
pronunciation pairs from Brulex, a lexical data base
for French ([Content et al., 1990]). Roughly similar
models resulted, proving reusability of technique.
In order to be able to compare these models to
the Dutch model described in this paper, we selected
for each language a comparable data base containing
20,000 word-pronunciation pairs, and divided these
data sets in test sets of 1,500 pairs and training
sets of 18,500 pairs. Figure 4 displays the result-
ing lookup tables, including the Dutch lookup table
displayed earlier in Figure 3.
Given the constant lookup table construction pro-
cedure and the similar data sets, two interesting dif-
ferences between the three models emerge. Firstly,
as can be seen clearly from Figure 4, there are sig-
nificant differences between the magnitudes of the
models. After expansion to 5-1-5 width, the French
model contains 18,000 patterns, the Dutch 27,000
and the English 35,000, reflecting differences in deep-
ness of orthography between the three languages.
Secondly, as the labels on the 2-1-3 subtable bars
in Figure 4 indicate, the performance accuracy of
the English model lags behind that of the Dutch and
French model. Final performance accuracy on the
test set, with the inclusion of default tables, is 98.2%
for the French model, 97.0% for the Dutch model
and 90.1% for the English model, again reflecting a
significant difference as regards deepness of orthog-

5 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99999196">
In computational linguistics, one of the common-
sense beliefs is that the performance of a system solv-
ing a linguistic problem improves with the amount
of linguistic knowledge and sophistication incorpo-
rated into it. We have shown that at least for one
linguistic task, this is not the case. The linguistically
least informed method (compression of a training set
into a table, complemented with a rudimentary form
of probabilistic reasoning) performed better on un-
seen input than a linguistically sophisticated, state-
of-the-art knowledge-based system. We have reason
to believe that this also applies to other linguistic
categorisation problems where superficial input fea-
tures and local context solve most ambiguities (we
have positive results on stress assignment, [Gillis et
al., 1992; Daelemans et al., 1993], and part of speech
tagging).
The data-oriented algorithms described are sim-
ple and domain-independent, and introduce a new
kind of reusability into computational linguistics:
reusability of the acquisition method (on different
data sets) rather than reusability of (hand-coded)
knowledge in different applications or formalisms.
The former type of reusability seems to be easier to
achieve than the latter.
