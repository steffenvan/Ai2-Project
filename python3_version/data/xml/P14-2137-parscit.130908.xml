This paper demonstrates the importance
of relation equivalence for entity trans-
lation pair discovery. Existing approach
of understanding relation equivalence has
focused on using explicit features of co-
occurring entities. In this paper, we ex-
plore latent features of temporality for un-
derstanding relation equivalence, and em-
pirically show that the explicit and latent
features complement each other. Our pro-
posed hybrid approach of using both ex-
plicit and latent features improves relation
translation by 0.16 F1-score, and in turn
improves entity translation by 0.02.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.997575782608696">
Understanding relations is important in entity
tasks. In this paper, we illustrate such importance
using named entity (NE) translation mining prob-
lem. Early research on NE translation used pho-
netic similarities, for example, to mine the trans-
lation ‘Mandelson’—*‘#- 40, %J: A’[ManDeErSen]
with similar sounds (Knight and Graehl, 1998;
Wan and Verspoor, 1998). However, not all NE
translations are based on transliterations, but they
might be based on semantics (e.g., ‘WTO’—*‘I
_WA�W[ShiMaoZuZhi]), or even arbitrary (e.g.,
‘Jackie Chan’—*‘A/t’[ChengLong]).
To address this challenge, current state-of-the-
art approaches build an entity graph for each lan-
guage corpus, and align the two graphs by prop-
agating the seed translation similarities (Figure 1)
(Kim et al., 2011; You et al., 2012). For exam-
ple, arbitrary translation pair such as (Jackie Chan,
A/t) can be obtained, if he is connected to his
film ‘Drunken Master’ (0#) in both graphs. That
is, we can propagate the seed translation similar-
ity of (Drunken Master, 0#) to neighbor entities
‘Jackie Chan’ and ‘A/t’ in each graph.

When two graphs are obtained from parallel
corpora, graphs are symmetric and “blind prop-
agation” described above is effective. In con-
trast, Lee and Hwang (2013) propose “selective
propagation” for asymmetric graphs, of compar-
ing the semantics of relations. A key contri-
bution of this paper is using relation temporal-
ity for determining relation equivalence. Exist-
ing work (Nakashole et al., 2012; Mohamed et
al., 2011; Lee and Hwang, 2013) uses only co-
occurring entity pairs, or explicit features (EF).
For example, for a relation pay an official visit to,
with a statement (Bush, pay an official visit to, China),
an entity pair (Bush, China) is in the “support
set”, which is a set of co-occurring entity pairs
of pay an official visit to. When its support set is
{(Bush, China), (Mandelson, Moscow), (Rice, Is-
rael)}, and that of visit is {(Bush, China), (Rice,
Israel), (Medvedev, Cuba)}, we can infer their se-
mantic equivalence based on the set intersection:
{(Bush, China), (Rice, Israel)}.
In contrast, we propose to explore corpus latent
features (LF), to complement the sparsity problem
of EF: Out of 158 randomly chosen correct re-
lation translation pairs we labeled, 64% has only
one co-occurring entity pair, which makes EF not
very effective to identify these relation transla-
tions. Therefore, we leverage relation temporality,
which is both orthogonal and complementary to
existing efforts leveraging entity temporality (Kle-

challenges on using temporality for relation under-
standing in comparable corpora, which we discuss
in detail in Section 3.2. Based on these challenges,
we identify three new features for LF.
We observe the complementary nature of EF
and LF, then propose a hybrid approach combin-
ing both features. Our new hybrid approach sig-
nificantly improves the relation translation (0.16
higher F1-score than EF), and in turn improves the
entity translation (0.02 higher F1-score).

Selective propagation, leveraging the statements

be summarized by several steps.

STEP 4 Repeat STEP 2 and STEP 3.
For STEP 1, an existing method for entity trans-
lation is adopted. In our experiments, we use a
non-selective (hence not requiring relation trans-
lations) propagation approach (You et al., 2012)
with (Lam et al., 2007) for a base translation ma-
trix. The focus of this paper is STEP 2, building the
translation score T(t) R(rE, rC) of English relation
rE and Chinese relation rC: We will discuss the
detailed procedure of STEP 2 and propose how to
improve it in Section 3. STEP 3 is the stage that
selective propagation takes place.
STEP 2 and STEP 3 reinforce each other to im-
prove the final entity translation function. While
STEP 3 is well-defined in (Lee and Hwang, 2013),
to propagate entity translation scores when the re-
lation semantics of the edges are equivalent, STEP
2 has been restricted to the explicit feature, i.e., co-
occurring entities or shared context. In clear con-
trast, by discovering novel latent features based on
temporal properties, we can increase the accuracy
of both entity and relation translations. Note that
we omit t for readability in the following sections.

3.1 Baseline: Explicit Feature Approach (EF)
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999995965517241">
In this section, we briefly illustrate a baseline
method EF (Lee and Hwang, 2013). As we
mentioned in the introduction, traditional ap-
proaches leverage common co-occurring entity-
pairs. This observation also holds in the bilin-
gual environment by exploiting seed entity trans-
lations. For example, let us say that we have
two extracted statements: (Bruce Willis, star in,
The Sixth Sense) and (布 鲁 斯·威 利 斯 (Bruce
Willis), 主演 (star in), 第六感 (The Sixth Sense)).
Knowing a few seed entity translations using TN,
‘Bruce Willis’→‘布鲁斯·威利斯’ and ‘The Sixth
Sense’→‘第六感’, we can find star in and 主演
are semantically similar.
Specifically, we quantify this similarity based
on the number of such common entity pairs that
we denote as |H(rE, rC) |for an English relation
rE and a Chinese relation rC. The existing ap-
proaches are variations of using |H(rE, rC)|. Our
baseline implementation uses the one by (Lee and
Hwang, 2013), and we refer the reader to the pa-
per for formal definitions and processing steps we
omitted due to the page limit.
Unfortunately, this approach suffers from spar-
sity of the common entity pairs due to the incom-
parability of the corpora and those entities that
cannot be translated by TN. Therefore, we lever-
age corpus latent features as an additional signal
to overcome this problem.

three big challenges in exploiting the temporality
in relation translations.
[C1] Considering temporal distributions d[r] of
relations alone is not sufficient. For relations, such
as visit, that involves diverse entities, the temporal
distributions are highly noisy (Figure 2a).
To address the first challenge, we use a finer-
granularity unit for observing the temporality.
More specifically, we exploit a coupling of a re-
lation and an entity: d[e, r, *] where e is an en-
tity, r a relation, and * is a placeholder indicating
that any noun phrase is accepted for the second ar-
gument of a statement.&apos; As shown in Figure 2b,
d[e, r, *] is more distinctive and hence a key clue
to find semantically equivalent relations.
[C2] Considering entity-relation coupling dis-
tribution d[e, r, *] alone is not sufficient due to
the domination of individual temporality. For ex-
ample, Figure 3 shows entity-dominating entity-
relation temporality. If an entity has a peak at
some period (Figure 3a), most relations that are
coupled with the entity would have a peak at the
very same period (Figure 3b). This makes all re-
lations that appear with this entity very similar to

tion translation scores and leverage the average score. But in
this section, we only use d[e, r, *] for readability.
each other regardlessly of semantics. To address
this challenge, we use features to measure whether
d[e, r, *] is too close to either of d[e] or d[r].
[C3] Lastly, we have to eliminate false positives
in relation temporality. To illustrate, two relations
deploy and 在...部署 (deploy at) have similar
temporal behaviors (Figure 2c). However, the first
relation takes [person], but the second relation [lo-
cation] for the second argument.
To address this, we check the common co-
occurring entity pair of the relations. For exam-
ple, we can obtain “Russia deployed an aircraft
carrier”, but not “Russia deployed at (在...部署)
an aircraft carrier”. Thus, we cannot acquire any
common entity pair like (Russia, aircraft carrier)
for deploy and 在...部署 (deploy at).

We find that LF and EF are complementary. Ta-
ble 1 shows the examples of relations and their

lations (e.g., support and capture). However,
in some cases like ratify, highly related relations
may induce noise. That is, we always i�i� (dis-
cuss) before we *, * (ratify) something and
hence the temporal behavior of i�i� (discuss)

hand, it can be correctly translated using EF.

In this section, we evaluate the proposed approach
on the entity translation task and the relation trans-

who publishes news in both English and Chinese,
which were also used by Lee and Hwang (2013).
The number of English articles is 100,746, and
that of Chinese articles is 88,031. As we can see
from the difference in the numbers of the docu-
ments, the news corpora are not direct translations,
but they have asymmetry of entities and relations.

Table 3 shows the comparisons of LF, EF
and their hybrid LF+EF. We can clearly see that
LF shows higher recall than EF while EF shows
higher precision. As we emphasized in Sec-
tion 3.3, we can see their complementary property.
Their hybrid LF+EF has both high precision and
recall, thus has the highest F1-score.
Note that the absolute numbers (due to the harsh
evaluation criteria) may look low. But the top
translations are still relevant (e.g., fight is trans-
lated to R (deploy troops)). In addition, the
lower ranked but correct relation translations also
affect entity translation. Therefore, even lower-
performing EF boosted the entity translations, and
in effect, our approach could achieve higher F1-
score in the entity translation task.
To illustrate the detailed effects of the corpus
latent features, Table 4 shows the ranks of correct
Chinese translations for English relations by meth-
ods using selected features for the challenges. For
comparison, the ranks of the correct translations
when using EF are shown. Our approach using
the entity-relation coupling similarity feature for

tions. But using all features removes such noise.

Table 2 shows the comparison of the methods.
Our proposed approach LF+EF shows higher F1-

only few statements mentioning him in the cor-

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.95604348">
This section considers the relation translation task.
Each relation translation method translates an En-
glish relation rE into a list of Chinese relations,
and we check whether a Chinese relation rC with
the highest translation score is the correct transla-
tion. We consider the relation translation is cor-
rect when the semantics are equivalent. For ex-
ample, -±- (leave for/go to) is a correct trans-
lation of leave for, but Aff (leave) is not. To-
tal 3342 English-Chinese relation translation pairs
returned by our method and the baselines are ran-
domly shown and labeled. Out of 3342 pairs, 399
are labeled as correct.
3Our results leveraging relational temporality outper-
forms the reported results using entity temporality on the
same data set. The two approaches using temporality are or-
thogonal and can be aggregated, which we leave as our future
directions.
This paper studied temporality features for re-
lation equivalence. With the proposed features,
we devised a hybrid approach combining corpus
latent and explicit features with complementary
strength. We empirically showed the effectiveness
of our hybrid approach on relation translation, and
it, in turn, improved entity translation.

Existing approach of understanding relation equivalence has focused on using explicit features of cooccurring entities. In this paper, we explore latent features of temporality for understanding relation equivalence, and empirically show that the explicit and latent features complement each other.

STEP 4 Repeat STEP 2 and STEP 3. For STEP 1, an existing method for entity translation is adopted. In our experiments, we use a non-selective (hence not requiring relation translations) propagation approach (You et al., 2012) with (Lam et al., 2007) for a base translation matrix. The focus of this paper is STEP 2, building the translation score T(t) R(rE, rC) of English relation rE and Chinese relation rC: We will discuss the detailed procedure of STEP 2 and propose how to improve it in Section 3. STEP 3 is the stage that selective propagation takes place. STEP 2 and STEP 3 reinforce each other to improve the final entity translation function.

In clear contrast, by discovering novel latent features based on temporal properties, we can increase the accuracy of both entity and relation translations. Note that we omit t for readability in the following sections. 3 Relation Translation In this section, we present our approaches to obtain relations of equivalent semantics across languages (e.g., visit→访 问).

Knowing a few seed entity translations using TN, ‘Bruce Willis’→‘布鲁斯·威利斯’ and ‘The Sixth Sense’→‘第六感’, we can find star in and 主演 are semantically similar. Specifically, we quantify this similarity based on the number of such common entity pairs that we denote as |H(rE, rC) |for an English relation rE and a Chinese relation rC. The existing approaches are variations of using |H(rE, rC)|. Our baseline implementation uses the one by (Lee and Hwang, 2013), and we refer the reader to the paper for formal definitions and processing steps we omitted due to the page limit. Unfortunately, this approach suffers from sparsity of the common entity pairs due to the incomparability of the corpora and those entities that cannot be translated by TN. Therefore, we leverage corpus latent features as an additional signal to overcome this problem. 3.2 Latent Feature Approach (LF) Temporal Feature Discovery We exploit the temporal distribution d[x](t) of textual element x during t-th week in statements; we count the occurrences of the element x on a weekly bas</context>

We extract English and Chinese statements from news articles in 2008 by Xinhua news who publishes news in both English and Chinese, which were also used by Lee and Hwang (2013). The number of English articles is 100,746, and that of Chinese articles is 88,031. As we can see from the difference in the numbers of the documents, the news corpora are not direct translations, but they have asymmetry of entities and relations. 4.1 Entity Translation In this section, we present experimental settings and results on translating entities using our proposed approaches.

However, not all NE translations are based on transliterations, but they might be based on semantics (e.g., ‘WTO’—*‘I _WA�W[ShiMaoZuZhi]), or even arbitrary (e.g., ‘Jackie Chan’—*‘A/t’[ChengLong]). To address this challenge, current state-of-theart approaches build an entity graph for each language corpus, and align the two graphs by propagating the seed translation similarities (Figure 1) (Kim et al., 2011; You et al., 2012). For example, arbitrary translation pair such as (Jackie Chan, A/t) can be obtained, if he is connected to his film ‘Drunken Master’ (0#) in both graphs. That is, we can propagate the seed translation similarity of (Drunken Master, 0#) to neighbor entities ‘Jackie Chan’ and ‘A/t’ in each graph.

When two graphs are obtained from parallel corpora, graphs are symmetric and “blind propagation” described above is effective. In contrast, Lee and Hwang (2013) propose “selective propagation” for asymmetric graphs, </context>

STEP 1 Initialize entity translation function T(0) N . STEP 2 Build relation translation function T(t) Rusing T(t) N . STEP 3 Update entity translation function to acquire T(t+1) N using T(Rt) . STEP 4 Repeat STEP 2 and STEP 3. For STEP 1, an existing method for entity translation is adopted. In our experiments, we use a non-selective (hence not requiring relation translations) propagation approach (You et al., 2012) with (Lam et al., 2007) for a base translation matrix. The focus of this paper is STEP 2, building the translation score T(t) R(rE, rC) of English relation rE and Chinese relation rC: We will discuss the detailed procedure of STEP 2 and propose how to improve it in Section 3. STEP 3 is the stage that selective propagation takes place. STEP 2 and STEP 3 reinforce each other to improve the final entity translation function. While STEP 3 is well-defined in (Lee and Hwang, 2013), to propagate entity translation scores when the relation semantics of the edges are equivalent, STEP 2 has been restri</context>

We measure precision, recall, and F1-score based on the returned translation pairs for each English entity as it is done in (Lee and Hwang, 2013). We compare our hybrid approach, which is denoted by LF+EF with EF (Lee and Hwang, 2013), a combined approach PH+SM of phonetic similarity and letter-wise semantic translation for better accuracy for organizations (Lam et al., 2007), and the seed translations Seed that we adopt (You et al., 2012) with PH+SM as a base translation matrix.3 We process one iteration of the entire framework (STEP 1-3) for both LF+EF and EF. Table 2 shows the comparison of the methods. Our proposed approach LF+EF shows higher F1- score than the baselines. In particular, our approach outperforms EF. For example, ‘Matthew Emmons’ is a lesser known entity, and we have only few statements mentioning him in the corpora. The corpus explicit feature EF alone cannot translate the relation win and, in turn, ‘Matthew Emmons’. However, LF+EF translates him correctly into VjT�-·*, * through the relation win. 4.2 Relati</context>

In particular, we discover three new challenges on using temporality for relation understanding in comparable corpora, which we discuss in detail in Section 3.2. Based on these challenges, we identify three new features for LF. We observe the complementary nature of EF and LF, then propose a hybrid approach combining both features. Our new hybrid approach significantly improves the relation translation (0.16 higher F1-score than EF), and in turn improves the entity translation (0.02 higher F1-score). 2 Preliminary: Entity Translation by Selective Propagation Selective propagation, leveraging</context>
