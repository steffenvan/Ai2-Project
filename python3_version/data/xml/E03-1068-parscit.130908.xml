We propose a new method for detect-
ing errors in &amp;quot;gold-standard&amp;quot; part-of-
speech annotation. The approach lo-
cates errors with high precision based
on n-grams occurring in the corpus with
multiple taggings. Two further tech-
niques, closed-class analysis and finite-
state tagging guide patterns, are dis-
cussed. The success of the three ap-
proaches is illustrated for the Wall Street
Journal corpus as part of the Penn Tree-
bank.

Part-of-speech (pos) annotated reference corpora,
such as the British National Corpus (Leech et al.,
1994), the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993),
or the German Negra Treebank (Skut et al., 1997)
play an important role for current work in com-
putational linguistics. They provide training ma-
terial for research on tagging algorithms and they
serve as a gold standard for evaluating the perfor-
mance of such tools. High quality, pos-annotated
text is also relevant as input for syntactic process-
ing, for practical applications such as information
extraction, and for linguistic research making use
of pos-based corpus queries.
The gold-standard pos-annotation for such large
reference corpora is generally obtained using an
automatic tagger to produce a first annotation,
followed by human post-editing. While Sinclair
(1992) provides some arguments for prioritizing
a fully automated analysis, human post-editing
has been shown to significantly reduce the num-
ber of pos-annotation errors. Brants (2000) dis-
cusses that a single human post-editor reduces the
3.3% error rate in the STTS annotation of the Ger-
man Negra corpus produced by the TnT tagger
to 1.2%. Baker (1997) also reports an improve-
ment of around 2% for a similar experiment car-
ried out for an English sample originally tagged
with 96.95% accuracy by the CLAWS tagger. And
Leech (1997) reports that manual post-editing and
correction done for the 2-million word core corpus
portion of the BNC, the BNC-sampler, reduced the
approximate error rate of 1.7% for the automati-
cally obtained annotation to less than 0.3%.
While the last figure clearly is a remarkable re-
sult, van Halteren (2000), working with the writ-
ten half of the BNC-sampler, reports that in 13.6%
of the cases where his WPDV tagger disagrees
with the BNC annotation, the cause is an error
in the BNC annotation.1 Improving the correct-
ness of such gold-standard annotation thus is im-
portant for obtaining reliable testing material for
pos-tagger research, as well as for the other uses
of gold-standard annotation mentioned at the be-
ginning of this section—a point which becomes
even stronger when one considers that the pos-
annotation of most reference corpora contain sig-
nificantly more errors than the 0.3% figure re-
ported for the BNC-sampler.
In this paper, we present three methods for auto-
matic detection of annotation errors which remain

despite human post-editing, and sometimes are ac-
tually caused by it. Our main proposal discussed
in section 2.1 is independent of the language and
tagset of the corpus and requires no additional lan-
guage resources such as lexica. It detects variation
in the pos-annotation of a corpus by searching for
n-grams which occur more than once in the corpus
and include at least one difference in their annota-
tion. We discuss how all such variation n-grams
of a corpus can be obtained and show that together
with some heuristics they are highly accurate pre-
dictors of annotation errors. In section 2.2 we
turn to two other simple ideas for detecting pos-
annotation errors, closed-class analysis and finite-
state tagging guide patterns. Finally, in section 3
we relate our research to several recent publica-
tions addressing the topic of pos-error correction.

2 Three methods for detecting errors
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999526">
The task of correcting part-of-speech annotation
can be viewed as consisting of two steps: i) detect-
ing which corpus positions are incorrectly tagged,
and ii) finding the correct tag for those positions.
The first step, detection, considers each corpus
position and classifies the tag of that position as
correct or incorrect. Given that this task involves
each corpus position, only a fully automatic detec-
tion method is feasible for a large corpus.
The second step, repair, considers those posi-
tions marked as errors and determines the correct
tag Taking the performance of current automatic
taggers as baseline for the quality of the &amp;quot;gold-
standard&amp;quot; pos-annotation we intend to correct, for
English we can assume that repair needs to con-
sider less than 3% of the number of corpus posi-
tions. This makes automation of this second step
less critical, as long as the error detection step has
a high precision (which is relevant since the repair
step also needs to deal with false positives from
detection).
Our research in this paper addresses the first is-
sue, detecting errors, and based on the just men-
tioned reasoning we focus on detecting errors au-
tomatically and with high precision.2 To do so,

any substantial number of errors from a &amp;quot;gold-standard&amp;quot; is
a worthwhile enterprise. In section 3 we discuss other ap-
proaches, which can be combined with ours to raise recall.

we propose three different methods, the first re-
lying on internal corpus variation, the second on
closed lexical classes, and the third on patterns in
the tagging guide. We illustrate the applicability
and effectiveness of each method by reporting the
results of applying them to the Wall Street Journal
(WSJ) corpus as part of the Penn Treebank 3 re-
lease, which was tagged using the PARTS tagger
and manually corrected afterwards (Marcus et al.,
1993).

2.1 Using the variation in a corpus
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999966157894737">
For each word that occurs in a corpus, there is a
lexically determined set of tags that can in prin-
ciple be assigned to this word. The tagging pro-
cess reduces this set of lexically possible tags to
the correct tag for a specific corpus occurrence. A
particular word occurring more than once in a cor-
pus can thus be assigned different tags in a corpus.
We will refer to this as variation.
Variation in corpus annotation is caused by one
of two reasons: i) ambiguity: there is a word
(&amp;quot;type&amp;quot;) with multiple lexically possible tags and
different corpus occurrences of that word (&amp;quot;to-
kens&amp;quot;) happen to realize the different options,3 or
ii) error: the tagging of a word is inconsistent
across comparable occurrences. We can therefore
locate annotation errors by zooming in on the vari-
ation exhibited by a corpus, provided we have a
way to decide whether a particular variation is an
ambiguity or an error—but how can this be done?

The key to answering the question lies in a classi-
fication of contexts: the more similar the context
of a variation, the more likely it is for the vari-
ation to be an error. But we need to make con-
crete what kind of properties the context consists
of and what counts as similar contexts. In this pa-
per, we focus on contexts composed of words4 and
we require identity of the context, not just similar-
ity. We will use the term variation n-gram for an

an auxiliary, a main verb, or a noun and thus there is variation

tuna for a living, and Pass me a can of beer, please.
40ther options allowing for application to more corpus
instances would be to use contexts composed of pos-tags or
some other syntactic or morphological properties.

n-gram (of words) in a corpus that contains a word
that is annotated differently in another occurrence
of the same 11-gram in the corpus. The word ex-
hibiting the variation is referred to as the variation
nucleus.
For example, in the WSJ, the string in (1) is
a variation 12-gram since off is a variation nu-
cleus that in one corpus occurrence of this string
is tagged as preposition (IN), while in another it is
tagged as a particle (RP).

European shipping concerns
Note that the variation 12-gram in (1) contains two
variation 11-grams, which one obtains by elimi-
nating either the first or the last word.
Algorithm To compute all variation n-grams of
a corpus, we make use of the just mentioned
fact that a variation n-gram must contain a vari-
ation (n - 1)-gram to obtain an algorithm efficient
enough to handle large corpora. The algorithm,
which essentially is an instance of the a priori al-
gorithm used in information extraction (Agrawal
and Srikant, 1994), takes a pos-annotated corpus
and outputs a listing of the variation n-grams,
from n = 1 to the longest n for which there is
a variation n-gram in the corpus.

2.1.2 Heuristics for classifying variation
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998381676923077">
Once the variation n-grams for a corpus have been
computed, heuristics can be employed to classify
the variations into errors and ambiguities. The first
heuristic encodes the basic fact that the tag assign-
ment for a word is dependent on the context of that
word. The second takes into account that natural
languages favor the use of local dependencies over
non-local ones. Both of these heuristics are inde-
pendent a specific corpus, tagset, or language.
Variation nuclei in long n-grams are errors
The first heuristic is based on the insight that a
variation is more likely to be an error than a true
ambiguity if it occurs within a long stretch of
otherwise identical material. In other words, the
longer the variation n-gram, the more likely that
the variation is an error.
For example, lending occurs tagged as adjective
(JJ) and as common noun (NN) within occurrences
of the same 184-gram in the corpus. It is very un-
likely that the context (109 identical words to the
left, 74 to the right) supports an ambiguity, and
the adjective tag does indeed turn out to be an er-
ror. Similarly, the already mentioned 224-gram in-
cludes 10 different variation nuclei, all of which
turn out to be erroneous variation.
While we have based this heuristic solely on
the length of the identical context, another factor
one could take into account for determining rele-
vant contexts are structural boundaries. A varia-
tion nucleus that occurs within a complete, other-
wise identical sentence is very likely an error.6
For example, the 25-gram in (2) is a complete
sentence that appears 14 times, four times with
centennial tagged as JJ and ten times with centen-
56,317 times in the WSJ, but 56,300 of these are correctly
annotated as determiner (DT).
°Since sentence segmentation information is often avail-
able for pos-tagged corpora, we focus on those structural do-
mains here. For treebanks, other constituent structure do-
mains could also be used for the purpose of determining the
size of the context of a variation that should be taken into
account for distinguishing errors from ambiguities.
nial marked as NN, with the latter being correct
according to the tagging guide (Santorini, 1990).
(2) During its centennial year, The Wall Street
Journal will report events of the past century
that stand as milestones of American busi-
ness history .
Distrust the fringe Turning the spotlight from
the n-gram and its properties to the variation nu-
cleus contained in it, an important property deter-
mining the likelihood of a variation to be an er-
ror is whether the variation nucleus appears at the
fringe of the variation n-gram, i.e., at the begin-
ning or the end of the context which is identical
over all occurrences.
For example, joined occurs as past tense verb
(VBD) and as past participle (VBN) within a vari-
ation 37-gram. It is the first word in the variation
37-gram and in one of the occurrences it is pre-
ceded by has and in another it is not. Despite the
relatively long context of 37 words to the right,
the variation thus is a genuine ambiguity, enabled
by the location of the variation nucleus at the left
fringe of the variation n-gram.

was sufficient to determine which tag is the correct one for
the variation nucleus. In some cases we also considered the

to verify which tag is correct for that instance. In theory,
some of the tagging options for a variation nucleus could be
ambiguities, whereas others would be errors; in practice this
did not occur.

that 2436 of those variation nuclei are errors, i.e.,
the variation in the tagging of those words as part
of the particular n-gram was incorrect. To get an
idea for how many tokens in the corpus correspond
to the 2436 variation nuclei that our method cor-
rectly flagged as being wrongly tagged, we hand-
corrected the mistagged instances of those words.
This resulted in a total of 4417 tag corrections.
Turning to the heuristics discussed in the pre-
vious section, for the first one an n-gram length of
six turns out to be a good cut-off point for the WSJ.
This becomes apparent when one takes a look at
where the 59 ambiguous variation nuclei arise: 32
of them are variation nuclei of 6-grams, 10 are part
of 7-grams, 4 are part of 8-grams, and the remain-
ing 13 occur in longer n-grams.
Regarding the second heuristic, distrust the
fringe, 57 of the 59 ambiguous variation nuclei
that were found are fringe elements, i.e., occur as
the first or last element of the variation n-gram.
The two exceptions are &amp;quot;and use some of the pro-
ceeds to&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;buy and sell big blocks of&amp;quot;, where
the variation nuclei use and sell are ambiguous be-
tween base form verb (VB) and third-person sin-
gular present tense verb (VBP) but do not occur
at the fringe. As an interesting aside, more than
half of the true ambiguities (31 of 59) occurred
between past tense verb (VBD) and past participle
(VBN) and are the first word in their n-gram.
Problematic cases Of the 2436 erroneous vari-
ation nuclei we discussed above, 140 of them de-
serve special attention here in that it was clear that
the variation was incorrect, but it was not possible
to decide based on the tagging guide (Santorini,
1990) which tag would be the right one to assign.9
That is, even without knowing the correct tag, it is
clear that the context demands a uniform tag as-
signment. Most of those cases concern the dis-
tinction between singular proper noun (NNP) and
plural proper noun (NNPS). For example, in the
bigram Salomon Brothers, Brothers is tagged 42
times as NNP and 30 times as NNPS; similarly,
Motors in General Motors is an NNP 35 times and

9While this is a problem with the pos-annotation in the
Penn Treebank, Voutilainen and Jarvinen (1995) show that in
principle it is possible to design and document a tagset in a
way that allows for 100% interjudge agreement for morpho-
logical (incl. part-of-speech) annotation.

While these variation nuclei clearly involve er-
roneous variation, they were not included in the
total count of incorrect tag assignments detected
by the variation n-gram method since the number
to be added depends on which tag is deemed to
be the correct one. For the NNP/NNPS cases, ei-
ther there are 362 additional errors in the corpus
(if NNP is correct) or 369 additional ones (in the
other case).

Aside from the main proposal of this paper, to use
a variation n-gram analysis combined with heuris-
tics for detecting corpus errors, there are two sim-
ple ideas for detecting errors which we want to
mention here. These techniques are conceptually
independent of the variation n-gram method, but
can be combined with it in a pipeline model.

2.2.1 Closed class analysis
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999799357142858">
Lexical categories in linguistics are traditionally
divided into open and closed classes. Closed
classes are the ones for which the elements can be
enumerated (e.g., classes like determiners, prepo-
sitions, modal verbs, or auxiliaries), whereas open
classes are the large, productive categories such as
verbs, nouns, or adjectives.
Making practical use of the concept of a closed
class, one can see that almost half of the tags in the
WSJ tagset correspond to closed lexical classes.
This means that a straightforward way for check-
ing the assignment of those tags is available. One
can search for all occurrences of a closed class tag
and verify whether each word found in this way is
actually a member of that closed class. This can
be done fully automatically, based on a list of tags
corresponding to closed classes and a list of the
few elements contained in each closed class.10
The WSJ annotation uses 48 tags (incl. punc-
tuation tags), of which 27 are closed class items.
Searching for determiners (DT) we found 50
words that were incorrectly assigned this tag. Ex-
10Conversely, one can also search for all occurrences of a
particular word that is a member of a closed class and check
that only the closed class tag is assigned. Some of these
words are actually ambiguous, though, so that additional lex-
ical information would be needed to correctly allow for addi-
tional tag assignments for such ambiguous words.

amples for the mistagged items include half in
both adjectival (JJ) and noun (NN) uses, the prede-
terminer (PDT) nary, and the pronoun (PRP) them.
Looking through three closed classes, we detected
94 such tagging errors.
In sum, such a closed class analysis seems to
be useful as an error detection/correction method,
which can be fully automated and requires very
little in terms of language specific resources.

2.2.2 Implementing tagging guide rules
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999983575757576">
Baker (1997) discusses that the BNC Tag En-
hancement Project used context sensitive rules to
fix annotation errors. The rules were written by
hand, based on an inspection of errors that often
resulted from the focus of the automatic tagger on
few properties in a small window. Oliva (2001)
also discusses building and applying such rules to
detect potential errors; some rules are specified to
automatically correct an error, while others require
human intervention.
Tagging guides such as the one for the WSJ
(Santorini, 1990) often specify a number of spe-
cific patterns and state explicitly how they should
be treated. One can therefore use the same tech-
nology as Baker (1997), Oliva (2001) and others
and write rules which match the specific patterns
given in the manual, check whether the correct
tags were assigned, and correct them where nec-
essary. This provides valuable feedback as to how
well the rules of the tagging guide were followed
by the corpus annotators and allows for the auto-
matic identification and correction of a large num-
ber of error pattern occurrences.
For example, the WSJ tagging manual states:
&amp;quot;Hyphenated nominal modifiers... should always
be tagged as adjectives.&amp;quot; (Santorini, 1990, p. 12).
While this rule is obeyed for 8605 occurrences in
the WSJ, there are also 2466 cases of hyphenated
words tagged as nouns preceding nouns, most of
which are violations of the above tagging man-
ual guideline, such as, for instance, stock-index in
stock-index futures, which is tagged 41 times as JJ
and 36 times as NN.

<bodyText confidence="0.99268274">
Considering the significant effort that has been
put into obtaining pos-tagged reference corpora in
the past decade, there are surprisingly few pub-
lications on the issue of detecting errors in pos-
annotation. In the past two or three years, though,
some work on the topic has appeared, so in the
following we embed our work in this context.
The starting point of our variation n-gram ap-
proach, that variation in annotation can indicate
an annotation error, essentially is also the start-
ing point of the approach to annotation error de-
tection of van Halteren (2000). But while we
look for variation in the annotation of comparable
stretches of material within the corpus, Van Hal-
teren proposes to compare the hand-corrected an-
notation of the corpus with that produced by an
automatic tagger, based on the idea that automatic
taggers are designed to detect &amp;quot;consistent behavior
in order to replicate it&amp;quot;. 11 Places where the auto-
matic tagger and the original annotation disagree
are thus deemed likely to be inconsistencies in the
original annotation. Van Halteren shows that his
idea is successful in locating a number of poten-
tial problem areas, but he concludes that checking
6326 areas of disagreement only unearths 1296 er-
rors. The precision for detecting errors based on
tagger-annotation disagreement thus is rather low,
which is problematic considering that the repair
stage that weeds out the many false positives of
error detection is a manual process.
Eskin (2000) discusses how to use a sparse
Markov transducer as a method for what he calls
anomaly detection. The notion of an anomaly es-
sentially refers to a rare local tag pattern. The
method flags 7055 anomalies for the Penn Tree-
bank, about 44% of which hand inspection shows
to be errors. Just as discussed for the approach of
Van Halteren mentioned above, the low precision
of the method of Eskin for detecting errors means
that the repair process has to deal with a high
number of false positives from the detection stage,
which is problematic since error correction is done
manually. In terms of the kind of errors that are
detected by the sparse Markov transducer, Eskin
notes that &amp;quot;if there are inconsistencies between an-
notators, the method would not detect the errors
11Abney et al. (1999) suggest a related idea based on using
the importance weights that a boosting algorithm employed
for tagging assigns to training examples; but they do not ex-
plore and evaluate such a method.

because the errors would be manifested over a sig-
nificant portion of the corpus.&amp;quot; Eskin&apos;s method
thus nicely complements the approach presented
in this paper, given that inter-annotator (and intra-
annotator) errors are precisely the kinds of errors
our variation n-gram method is designed to detect.
Kvet son and Oliva (2002) employ the notion of
an invalid bigram to locate corpus positions with
annotation errors. An invalid bigram is a pos-
tag sequence that cannot occur in a corpus, and
the set of invalid bigrams is derived from the set
of possible bigrams occurring in a hand-cleaned
sub-corpus, as well as linguistic intuition. Using
this method, Kveton and Oliva (2002) report find-
ing 2661 errors in the NEGRA corpus (containing
396,309 tokens). Interestingly, most of the errors
found by the approaches we presented in this pa-
per are perfectly valid bigrams. The invalid bi-
gram approach of Kveton and Oliva (2002) thus
also nicely complements our proposal.
Hirakawa et al. (2000) and Muller and Ule
(2002) are two approaches which use the pos-
annotation as input for syntactic processing—a
full syntactic analysis in the former and a shal-
low topological field parse in the latter case—and
single out those sentences for which the syntactic
processing does not provide the expected result.
Different from the approach we have described in
this paper, both of these approaches require a so-
phisticated, language specific grammar and a ro-
bust syntactic processing regime so that the failure
of an analysis can confidently be attributed to an
error in the input and not an error in the grammar
or the processor.

4 Summary and Outlook
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999989866666667">
We have presented three detection methods for
pos-annotation errors which remain in gold-
standard corpora despite human post-editing. Our
main proposal is to detect variation within compa-
rable contexts and classify such variation as error
or ambiguity using heuristics based on the nature
of the context. The detection method can be au-
tomated, is independent of the particular language
and tagset of the corpus, and requires no additional
language resources such as lexica. We showed that
an instance of this method based on identity of
words in the variation contexts, so-called variation
n-grams, successfully detects a variety of errors in
the WSJ corpus.
The usefulness of the notion of a variation n-
gram relies on a particular word to appear sev-
eral times in a corpus, with different annota-
tions. It thus works best for large corpora and
hand-annotated or hand-corrected corpora, or cor-
pora involving other sources of inconsistency.
As Ratnaparkhi (1996) points out, interannotator
bias creates inconsistencies which a completely
automatically-tagged corpus does not have. And
Baker (1997) makes the point that a human post-
editor also decreases the internal consistency of
the tagged data since he will spot a mistake made
by an automatic tagger for some but not all of its
occurrences. As a result, our variation n-gram ap-
proach is well suited for the gold-standard anno-
tations generally resulting from a combination of
automatic annotation and manual post-editing. A
case in point is that we recently applied the varia-
tion n-gram algorithm to the BNC-sampler corpus
and obtained a significant number of variation n-
grams up to length 692.
The variation n-gram approach as the instance
of our general idea to detect variation in compara-
ble contexts presented in this paper prioritizes the
precision of error detection by requiring identity
of the words in the context of a variation in order
for a variation n-gram to be detected. Despite this
emphasis on precision, the significant number of
errors the method detected in the WSJ shows that
the recall obtained is useful in practice. In the fu-
ture, we intend to experiment with defining varia-
tion contexts based on other, more general proper-
ties than the words themselves in order to increase
recall, i.e., the number of errors detected. Natural
candidates are the pos-tags of the words in the con-
text. Other context generalizations also seem to
be available if one is willing to include language
or corpus specific information in computing the
contexts. In the WSJ corpus, for example, differ-
ent numerical amounts, which frequently appear
in the same context, could be treated identically.
In terms of outlook, the variation n-gram
method can also be applied to other types of cor-
pus annotation. Given that the quality of syntac-
tic constituency and function annotation in current
treebanks lags significantly behind that of pos-

annotation, methods for detecting errors in syn-
tactic annotation have a wide area of application.
By applying the variation n-gram method to a
syntactically-annotated string, we can detect those
n-grams which occur several times but with a dif-
ferent constituent structure or syntactic function.
Future research has to show whether it is possi-
ble to classify the syntactic variation n-grams thus
detected into errors and ambiguities with the same
precision as is the case for the pos-annotation vari-
ation n-grams we discussed in this paper.

The gold-standard pos-annotation for such large reference corpora is generally obtained using an automatic tagger to produce a first annotation, followed by human post-editing. While Sinclair (1992) provides some arguments for prioritizing a fully automated analysis, human post-editing has been shown to significantly reduce the number of pos-annotation errors. Brants (2000) discusses that a single human post-editor reduces the 3.3% error rate in the STTS annotation of the German Negra corpus produced by the TnT tagger to 1.2%.

Van Halteren shows that his idea is successful in locating a number of potential problem areas, but he concludes that checking 6326 areas of disagreement only unearths 1296 errors. The precision for detecting errors based on tagger-annotation disagreement thus is rather low, which is problematic considering that the repair stage that weeds out the many false positives of error detection is a manual process. Eskin (2000) discusses how to use a sparse Markov transducer as a method for what he calls anomaly detection. The notion of an anomaly essentially refers to a rare local tag pattern. The method flags 7055 anomalies for the Penn Treebank, about 44% of which hand inspection shows to be errors. Just as discussed for the approach of Van Halteren mentioned above, the low precision of the method of Eskin for detecting errors means that the repair process has to deal with a high number of false positives from the detection stage, which is problematic since error correction is done manually.

We illustrate the applicability and effectiveness of each method by reporting the results of applying them to the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) corpus as part of the Penn Treebank 3 release, which was tagged using the PARTS tagger and manually corrected afterwards (Marcus et al., 1993). 2.1 Using the variation in a corpus For each word that occurs in a corpus, there is a lexically determined set of tags that can in principle be assigned to this word. The tagging process reduces this set of lexically possible tags to the correct tag for a specific corpus occurrence. A particular word occurring more than once in a corpus can thus be assigned different tags in a corpus. We will refer to this as variation. Variation in corpus annotation is caused by one of two reasons: i) ambiguity: there is a word (&amp;quot;type&amp;quot;) with multiple lexically possible tags and different corpus occurrences </context>

The success of the three approaches is illustrated for the Wall Street Journal corpus as part of the Penn Treebank. 1 Introduction Part-of-speech (pos) annotated reference corpora, such as the British National Corpus (Leech et al., 1994), the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993), or the German Negra Treebank (Skut et al., 1997) play an important role for current work in computational linguistics. They provide training material for research on tagging algorithms and they serve as a gold standard for evaluating the performance of such tools. High quality, pos-annotated text is also relevant as input for syntactic processing, for practical applications such as information extraction, and for linguistic research making use of pos-based corpus queries. The gold-standard pos-annotation for such large reference corpora is generally obtained using an automatic tagger to produce a first annotation, followed by human post-edi</context>

Most of those cases concern the distinction between singular proper noun (NNP) and plural proper noun (NNPS). For example, in the bigram Salomon Brothers, Brothers is tagged 42 times as NNP and 30 times as NNPS; similarly, Motors in General Motors is an NNP 35 times and 9While this is a problem with the pos-annotation in the Penn Treebank, Voutilainen and Jarvinen (1995) show that in principle it is possible to design and document a tagset in a way that allows for 100% interjudge agreement for morphological (incl. part-of-speech) annotation. an NNPS 51 times. While these variation nuclei clearly involve erroneous variation, they were not included in the total count of incorrect tag assignments detected by the variation n-gram method since the number to be added depends on which tag is deemed to be the correct one. For the NNP/NNPS cases, either there are 362 additional errors in the corpus (if NNP is correct) or 369 additional ones (in the other case). 2.2 Tw</context>
