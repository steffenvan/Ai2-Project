<bodyText confidence="0.999892576923077">
RECONSIDER is an interactive diag-
nostic prompting program which uses
simple information retrieval tech-
niques to prompt a physician regard-
ing possible diagnoses, given a list of
positive patient findings. Its
knowledge base consists of &amp;quot;struc-
tured text&amp;quot; definitions of 3262
diseases and a synonym dictionary.
Patient findings, and their synonyms,
are matched against inverted files of
terms from the disease descriptions,
the number and selectivity of the pa-
tient findings matching terms in a
given disease description determine
that disease&apos;s &amp;quot;score&amp;quot;, and the
matched diseases are sorted on this
score to form a preliminary
differential diagnosis. Definitions of
diseases can be referenced for view-
ing by name, or by their position in a
differential. While its first formal
evaluation is not yet complete, the
performance of RECONSIDER contin-
ues to exceed the expectations of
user and designer alike.

1. Motivation &amp; Background
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9976555">
A review of the various means by which
medical knowledge is represented in symbolic
form [6. 7j Led us to formulate the following
spectrum:
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.2195352">
Human. Machine
Processible Processible
Spectrum of
Medical Knowledge Representation
Schemes
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.977000830508475">
The two endpoints of the spectrum represent
the limiting cases wherein
knowledge is difficult, or impossible, to
process algorithmically, but transparent
to medical personnel, e.g. free text;
or easily processible algorithmically, and
difficult to process by humans untrained
in applied mathematics or computer sci-
ence. e.g. a matrix of Bayesian probabili-
ties, or a semantic network.
Those attending this conference will be familiar
with work at both ends of the spectrum, if not in
medicine, then in other knowledge domains.
Most will concede that the greatest &amp;quot;successes&amp;quot;
in the field of expert systems has been achieved
by those working at or near the right-hand end
of the spectrum; and that progress has been
most difficult to achieve at the left-hand end of
the spectrum. We concluded that, for the short
run at least, those successes at the right-hand
end would prove to be self-limiting - knowledge
that was not readily accessible to and modifiable
by the medical community at large could not
remain in the mainstream of medical practice.
Similarly, we saw no immediate prospects for a
breakthrough in the algorithmic understanding
of free text, though impressed with accomplish-
ments in the area of natural language access to
databases [9,10).
The dilemma these observations implied led
us to formulate the following question:
Can knowledge about diseases 6e
represented in a form that is easily
comprehended by physicians not
trained in computer science or
artificia/ intelligence, and yet still
be aLgorithmica/ly processtble to-
ward sante medically useful end&apos;?
Our initial attempts to answer this question led
us to formulate yet another knowledge
representation scheme, one which operated
somewhat to the right of the human-processible
end of the spectrum. Conceding the important
role of wards (rather than text) as conveyers of
meaning in medicine, we focused on a hierarchi-
cal nominal-attribute model, wherein norninals
(electrons, cells, lungs. etc) were &amp;quot;defined&amp;quot; in
terms of attributes (spin. neoplastic, congested,
etc.). Obviously, nominals could be attributes of
other higher level nominals, and attributes
could be nor/line&apos;s at a lower level. The principle
result of this model was the observation that
some words had meaning only at certain levels -
electrons could not be congested or neoplastic,
nor could lungs or cells have spin. While the
idea of &amp;quot;levels of description&amp;quot; is not new, such
levels were observed to be both well separated
and powerful determiners of context in medi-
cine,&apos; In turn, well defined contexts implied, not
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.484717571428571">
&apos;This is not a tautology. In the world of artifacts (mien-
made nominals), levels are not so well separated or orderly.
Until recently one would not ordinarily think of &apos;spark plug&apos;
and &apos;computer&apos; as having closely connected meanings. but
new electronic ignition systems in cars combine both in a
single system. Biological systems are not so freely re-
arranged.

surprisingly, well determined meanings for
words, diminishing the need for syntax to clarify
or disambiguate meaning.
Our search for an body of imowledge on
which to explore certain hypotheses regarding
such a nominal-attribute model in medicine led
us to regard a familiar but little used resource
in medicine in a new light. A corpus of com-
puter readable disease definitions was seen to
be a crude instantiation of the model. In this
corpus each disease was given a name (a nomi-
nal), and defined by its (usually clinical) attri-
butes - the original motivation for the corpus
being the standardization of disease nomencla-
ture. The attributes were written in a tele-
graphic, but otherwise easily readable style, and
organized, for each disease, in a relatively stable
format - a form we have chosen to call struc-
tured text.
Superficially, the corpus had but one level
of description, attributes of diseases. But each
disease definition was divided, explicitly, into
&amp;quot;contexts&amp;quot; (etiology. symptoms, ... lab. x-ray.
...). and each disease was place in one (or. at
most, two) &amp;quot;body systems&amp;quot; (whole body, skin.....
urogenital, ...). These contexts and systems
were obviously strong, if imprecise, determiners
of context.
Early experiments [3.4] with this corpus.
the computer readable version of Current Medi-
co/ Information and Terminology (CMIT), 4th
Edition [14 explored the selective and associa-
tive power of the words it employed, and
confirmed our hypothesis that word use in it was
both relatively consistent and systematic. We
soon realized that the sharpest test of the abil-
ity of words to convey meaning in this context
was to evaluate the corpus as a knowledge base
for a &amp;quot;diagnoses program&amp;quot; which would accept a
description of the patient in the form of a list of
words, such as &apos;pain, fever, jaundice, ...&apos;. The
specific diagnostic problem we addressed was
that of formulating a &amp;quot;differential diagnosis&amp;quot;3
[12, 15], which included, as alluded to by Scad-
ding [21, 5], diseases that a physician might not
otherwise think of, but, perhaps, should think of.
Important to our attempt to formulate a
diagnostic prompting program was not only that
the knowledge base should be readily
comprehensible, but. if the disease &amp;quot;prompts&amp;quot;
were to be credible, the &amp;quot;reasoning&amp;quot; by which
diseases were retrieved and ranked had to be
equally accessible - a consultative criterion
noted by Shortliffe and co-workers [22,23].
In addition, the availability of a knowledge
base containing in excess of 3000 disease
descriptions has allowed us to study phenomena
that would be hard to reproduce in the context
of most &amp;quot;expert systems&amp;quot;.3 For example,
5A &amp;quot;differential diagnosis&amp;quot; is usually a list of diseases
which represents the current thinking of a physician regard-
ing poinible diagneees for a given patient, at a given point in
the diagnostic process.
sThat best know diagnoais program, an expert system
formerly named INTERNIST - now called CADUCEUS, 125current-
appended to this paper is a transcript of an
interaction with RECONSIDER regarding a case
of methanol poisoning supplied by one of the
authors (SN). None of the patient findings are
particularly specific. but RECONSIDER places
the correct diagnosis in 6th place, and deter-
mines that most of the diseases near the top of
the differential are &amp;quot;whole body&apos; diseases, a
group containing most toxicity diseases. If this
differential were selected from among a few hun-
dred diseases, or even from a knowledge base of
toxicity diseases, the result would be more open
to a variety of less favorable interpretations.
Put differently, when one is retrieving from such
a large knowledge base, one is more tolerant
about the appearance of &amp;quot;false positives&amp;quot;
(diseases that shouldn&apos;t be there) in the
interests of minimizing the number of &amp;quot;false
negatives&amp;quot; (diseases that should be there, but
are not).
Finally, RECONSIDER provides a test bed
for the evaluation of some hypotheses regarding
the kind of problems encountered representing
and utilizing knowledge about the &apos;natural&apos;, as
opposed to &apos;artificial&apos;, world. Briefly, RECON-
SIDER benefits from the high degree of struc-
ture observable in diagnostic medicine, in spite
of our ignorance in many areas, and the other-
wise generally unappreciated stability and
specificity of medical language regarding this
structure.

2. Expectations?

<bodyText confidence="0.999167205882353">
Non-medical audiences should be reminded
of differing expectations regarding such mean-
ing representation experiments. As computer
scientists, two of us (msr &amp; DOS) &amp;quot;knew&amp;quot; that
meaning could not be represented satisfactorily
by words alone: words were ambiguous, in gen-
eral. and, besides, syntax was a partner with
semantics, and to separate the two was to
grossly distort the meaning of either.4 We
regarded early efforts as potentially interesting
from the point of view of statistical linguistics -
how did words and contexts associate? However,
the medically trained member of the initial
team (MSB) predicted the successful perfor-
mance of RECONSIDER once he saw the results
of some early word-counting experiments.
Later, SN, an internist with a background in
mathematics, anticipated the performance lim-
iting aspect of RECONSIDER without ever using
the program! (He predicted that inadequacies
in the knowledge base would be more important
than any shortcomings in the algorithms by
which descriptions of patients were &amp;quot;matched&amp;quot;
with the descriptions of the diseases.)

4A local example of failure in &amp;quot;full-text searching&amp;quot; was
recently brought to our attention 031 In a search of docu-
ments in a database collected for a suit regarding a large
constriction project, precision (the probabilty of a docu-
ment being relevant) was no better than 80Z, which might
have been acceptable except for the fact that the recoil (the
probability that the relevant document will be retrieved) was
no better than 20Zt

1. An Example of &apos;Structured Text&apos;
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9713949375">
CMIT was designed first for human users, as
a reference of standard disease names (in book
form it is about the size of the World Almanac),
and second for computer applications. (The
RECONSIDER-formatted CMIT definition of
methyl alcohol, toxicity appears in the appendix
of this paper.) The &amp;quot;structure&amp;quot; imposed on CMIT
definitions is largely external to the Language of
those definitions.
First, the entire text of CMIT is organized in the
aforementioned nominal-attribute form, the
disease names being the nominals and the
descriptions consisting of the attributes of the
disease.&apos;
Second. each disease is assigned to one, or pos-
sibly two, body systems:
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.964655523809524">
whole body
skin
musculoskeletal
respiratory
cardiovascular
hemic &amp; lymphatic
gastrointestinal
urogenital
endocrine
TUITIJOUS
special sense organs
Third, each disease is described in parts:
additiona/ terms (synonyms &amp; eponyms)
etiology
symptoms
signs
complications
Laboratory
pathology
x-ray
references&apos;
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.99717796">
Fourth, within each part, the descending hierar-
chy of sentences, clauses, and phrases (all
inferrable from punctuation) are used relatively
consistently to denote appropriate &amp;quot;chunks&amp;quot; of
meaning.
Thus, in this instance, structured text is
tightly edited prose written in nominal-attribute
form, employing external markers, and rela-
tively consistent punctuation, style, and vocabu-
lary. Put differently. CMIT can be &amp;quot;structurally&amp;quot;
parsed without the need to infer any of the
semantics from the text. (Again, a portion of
this &amp;quot;parse&amp;quot; is what produces the &amp;quot;display&amp;quot; of
the definition of methyl alcohol, toxicity shown
in the appendix.)
&apos;As we are learning !ram ma evaluation, the names of
diseases, even when they are descriptive names (as clarr
designed to encourage), are not always sufficient to deter-
mine which disease is being spoken of. Without the descrip-
tions (attributes) p&apos;nysician.s would be unable to resolve the
problems created by different systems of disease nomencla-
ture.

of MIT is that it contains references, mention of which is not
made in the printed version.

Thus, a dictionary (containing in excess of
20,000 such terms) was formed and CMIT
&amp;quot;inverted&amp;quot;, so that each dictionary entry was fol-
lowed by pointers to every occurrence of that
entry in CMIT. Included with every pointer were
the seven attributes associated with each
occurrence of that term- There are 333,211
term occurrences in CMIT, for an average of
about 102 terms per disease. or 79 unique terms
per disease, the difference being terms that are
used more than once in a given definition. In
principle. this &amp;quot;dictionary&amp;quot; could be used to
reconstruct CMIT, as it represents, in alterna-
tive format, exactly the same information!
This large inverted file allows efficient
searching for terms in the text. The searches
can be (1) constrained to a context (diseases of
the skin), (2) constrained to textual proximity
(adjacency. or membership within a clause). or
(3) constrained to a definition part (symptoms
only).

A 15,388 term &amp;quot;synonym&amp;quot; ciictionary3,
includes words not in CMIT which are synonyms
of words used in the CUIT definitions and words
already in CMIT that are synonyms of each other
(e.g. pruritus and itching). These are parti-
tioned amongst 4,165 &amp;quot;synonym classes&amp;quot; (the
two or more words within each class are
synonyms of each other). Search options allow
searches with or without equivalencing the
synonyms, and with or without invoking
hierarchical synonyms. The term &amp;quot;synonym&amp;quot; is
used generously, as the dictionary is actually
functioning as a kind of semantic net - connect-
ing words with strong conceptual links. It should
also be noted that RECONSIDER does not
employ &amp;quot;stemming&amp;quot;. All variants of a term (and
some phrases. e.g. abdominal path), including.
in some cases, mis-spellings, appear within a sin-

5.2. Diagnostic Prompting: An Example
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995315647727273">
We believe that RECONSIDER performs
better, and much more usefully, at an earlier
point in the diagnostic process, at a time prior
to any extensive patient work-up, when the
physician&apos;s &amp;quot;cognitive span&amp;quot; is widest [2].
For example, a patient presents with
findings as noted at the beginning of the appen-
dix. RECONSIDER begins by prompting for
terms. The prefix ss / is used by the physician-
user to indicate that the succeeding terms are
to be searched for in either the symptoms, or
signs portions of the disease descriptions. This
grouping, a union of the two vocabularies, was
necessitated by the non-consistent usage of
terms in these contexts.° The phrase abdominal
pain will match (given the RECONSIDER options
selected to run this case) any co-occurrence of
these two words (or its synonyms) within a single
clause. RECONSIDER responds with the
synonyms it knows for the terms entered, and
&apos;The use of terms within CMIT did not. follow the medical
dogma as to what was a symptom and what was a sag&apos;s.
the number of diseases containing one of more
occurrences of each of the terms within the ss/
context. The response abdominal pain[ 191+ 80]
indicates that the pair abdominal pain occurs in
191 diseases and that 80 additional diseases
have been retrieved by the synonyms for abdom-
inal pain, namely colic[35], colicky[18], and
pain in abdotran[48]. The fact that 35+15+48
exceeds 80, and 191+35+18+48 exceeds
191+180. indicates that some disease definitions
contain more than one term from this synonym
class.
The score (a measure of selectivity) for
abdominal pain is
0.917 = 1 &apos;(271/3262)
where 271 is the number of &amp;quot;disease
occurrences&amp;quot; of abdominal pain, and 3282 is the
total number of diseases in CWT. A disease&apos;s
score is the sum of the scores of the terms its
description matched.
Most physicians would probably conclude
that the observation that the patient smoked
was not relevant to the patient&apos;s illness, but the
term smoking was entered here to show its obvi-
ous effect on the disease list (it brings nicotine.
toxicity and drug dependance, marihuana
nearer to the top, partly because it is so &amp;quot;selec-
tive&amp;quot;). It is not clear which &apos;part&apos; of the disease
descriptions the term smoking will be found in.
so its search context is all/, and the same deci-
sion is made with respect to acidosis. Anion gap
acidosis is not used in CMI&apos;!&apos;, so we enter the
more general form.l° Entering smoking in the
all/ context has the disadvantage that it brings
in a reference to smoky, which is used as an
adjective.
The histogram displays the body system
frequencies for the diseases near the top of the
disease list (the top 4Z was selected by the user
to include about the first &amp;quot;screen&apos;s worth&amp;quot; of the
disease list - 679 diseases containing one or
more of the terms entered, or their synonyms).
A physician-user viewing the first screen-
full of this list (the portion shown in the appen-
dix) would next formulate a strategy for resolv-
ing it, assuming the diagnosis was still not
immediately apparent. A methodical approach
would note first that no disease matched all five
entries (as no disease has a score of 4.738).
Similarly, diseases #1. #2. and #3 would be ruled
out by asking the patient appropriate questions.
(If the patient were from Marin County, here in
the Bay Area, we might focus our initial atten-
tion on #2, mushroom, toxicity, in response to

use his or her own knowledge of medicine, to know that the
term acidosis is the best substitute under these cz,

cordirm that, in general, more medical knowledge makes one
a more effective RECONSIDER user. if true, we regard this
as a poaitive feature of RECONSIDER.

extremely unlikely. Since the patient is not an

ate test would confirm the existence of the toxic

<bodyText confidence="0.992422578947368">
We have not permitted RECONSIDER to be
used &amp;quot;live&amp;quot; in a clinical context. In addition to
the fact that evaluation of the program is not
complete, the knowledge base is known to be out
of date. Nonetheless since we have been able to
move RECONSIDER to the MIS-UCSF VAX 11/750
running UN1X0 (Berkeley 4.1) students, post-
doctoral fellows and some faculty have been able
to use the program. The initial reaction usually
consists of the following three observations: (1)
&amp;quot;Why is that disease there?&amp;quot; (sometimes it&apos;s
there legitimately, and sometimes not), (2) &amp;quot;How
does such a dumb program do so well?&amp;quot; (refer-
ring to RECONSIDER&apos;s lack of evident reasoning
power), and (3) &apos;&apos;What I need to be able to do now
is ...&amp;quot; (fill in your favorite interactive-
knowledge-base user-feature).
We tolerate the problem alluded to by ques-
tion (1) because it is more important, at this
stage of development, not to miss important
diseases, and because it is easier for a
physician-user to reject totally inappropriate
diseases than it is for the program to do so.
Question (2) alludes to the point raised by the
title of this paper. RECONSIDER can only be
considered an &amp;quot;expert&amp;quot; (if at all) because its
knowledge base is so large (relative to what a
physician can keep readily available in his or her
head), and because of its performance. It is
obviously not like a human &amp;quot;expert&amp;quot; in the way it
arrives at the disease list. And question (3) we
take to be a compliment that reveals, among
other things, that occasionally the utility of
RECONSIDER is limited not by the knowledge it
contains, but by the means we currently have of
accessing it through the narrow window of a 23-
line CRT terminal.
Question (1) deserves further comment,
The author (MST) has observed considerable
user-discomfort caused by CMIT mixing diseases

dissonance is usually avoided by thinking about
diseases by system. as the discomfort can be
relieved by restricting the search (and thus the

behavior predicted by our model of context in a
nominal-attribute knowledge base, further study
is suggested. In any case, it may prove neces-
sary to re-design the user-interface to accomo-
date some users&apos; need to view deseases by sys-
tem, within a contextless search.

A formal evaluation of RECONSIDER on 100
serial admissions to a tertiary care medical
ward, is in progress (and will be reported else-
where), but the preliminary results are both
encouraging and interesting. They are
encouraging because the correct diagnoses is
included so often in the first frame or two (and
usually higher), and interesting because the
difference between diagnostic programs, and
diagnostic prompting programs is made quite
clear. The former have a very specific goal, and
it is easy to tell whether it is reached or not. A
prompting program is evaluated against a
different standard: not whether it is correct but

thing is helpful or not may be a subtle matter.
If the correct diagnosis is included high on the
list, the performance can be given a high score.
But if, instead, a listed disease closely related to
the correct one has the result of directing the
physician&apos;s attention to the correct body sys-
tem, and finally the correct diagnosis, how is
this to be scored?

anticipate that a half a man-year of &amp;quot;tuning&amp;quot;
would significantly improve RECONSIDERs per-
formance. but that the next and much more
serious limitation will be the quality, uniformity,
completeness, and timeliness of CMIT and the
synonym dictionary. Given the opportunity to
rewrite CMIT (and continue to do so on an on-
going basis), or introducing Al techniques to
RECONSIDER (we have received many sugges-

we would retreat from our original notion that it
should not be modified (so as to prove that
structured text could be used, intact, as a
knowledge base). Rather we would maintain the
inverted files dynamically, in a relational data-
base, so as to facilitate modifications, and
experiments with alternative knowledge
representations and retrieval techniques.
Specifically, we would investigate the difficulty
of re-writing CMIT to improve the quality and
timeliness of the information it contained, to
use a more standard model of disease nomencla-
ture [1], to evaluate alternative ways of handling
negation (such as jaundice absent), and the
allow users to specify necessity (a term must
occur, or not occur, in a disease description for
it to be retrieved).
RECONSIDER currently requires some 20
MB of disk space. A dynamically revisable ver-
sion would require at least twice that, making
RECONSIDER a little like an orphan elephant in
already pressed medical computing environ-
ments. A &amp;quot;production&amp;quot; version of RECONSIDER
might fit in 15 MB. leaving two alternatives for
the future: running RECONSIDER on the large
address-space micro-based systems now avail-
able with large hard disks, or making it available
on a network. We are looking into both possibili-
ties.

10. Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99993235">
In the context of medical diagnoses, and
perhaps in other application areas, &amp;quot;structured
text&amp;quot;, as defined here, has been neglected as a
means of representing information in a form
accessible to both humans and algorithms. If as
Minsky has put it. &amp;quot;For a program, being smart
is knowing a lot.&amp;quot;, then carefully edited and con-
structed natural language text, available in
computer-readable form, may facilitate the pro-
cess by which programs come to &amp;quot;know a lot&amp;quot;
and continue to &amp;quot;know a lot&amp;quot; as the knowledge
evolves over time.
We conclude by noting that ultimately tki-e
usefulness of diagnostic aids such as RECON-
SIDER, must await the verdict of users. If the
cost and bother of their use is less than the
benefit they are found to provide, we can expect
them to make their way into clinical practice.
Up until the present time, no diagnostic support
program seems to have accomplished this.

Motivation &amp; Background of the various means by which medical knowledge is represented in symbolic form [6. 7j Led us to formulate the following spectrum:</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.999630371165646">The two endpoints of the spectrum represent the limiting cases wherein knowledge is difficult, or impossible, to process algorithmically, but transparent to medical personnel, e.g. free text; processible algorithmically, and difficult to process by humans untrained in applied mathematics or computer science. e.g. a matrix of Bayesian probabilities, or a semantic network. Those attending this conference will be familiar with work at both ends of the spectrum, if not in medicine, then in other knowledge domains. Most will concede that the greatest &amp;quot;successes&amp;quot; in the field of expert systems has been achieved by those working at or near the right-hand end the spectrum; and progress has difficult to achieve left-hand end spectrum. We concluded for short least, at the end would prove to be self-limiting knowledge readily accessible to and modifiable by the medical community at large could not remain in the mainstream of medical practice. saw immediate prospects for a breakthrough in the algorithmic understanding of free text, though impressed with accomplishments in the area of natural language access to databases [9,10). The dilemma these observations implied led us to formulate the following question: diseases in a that is easily physicians in and yet still processtble tomedically useful end&apos;? Our initial attempts to answer this question led us to formulate yet another knowledge representation scheme, one which operated somewhat to the right of the human-processible end of the spectrum. Conceding the important role of wards (rather than text) as conveyers of in medicine, focused on hierarchical nominal-attribute model, wherein norninals (electrons, cells, lungs. etc) were &amp;quot;defined&amp;quot; in terms of attributes (spin. neoplastic, congested, etc.). Obviously, nominals could be attributes of other higher level nominals, and attributes could be nor/line&apos;s at a lower level. The principle result of this model was the observation that some words had meaning only at certain levels electrons could not be congested or neoplastic, nor could lungs or cells have spin. While the idea of &amp;quot;levels of description&amp;quot; is not new, such levels were observed to be both well separated and powerful determiners of context in medicine,&apos; In turn, well defined contexts implied, not &apos;This is not a tautology. In the world of artifacts (mienmade nominals), levels are not so well separated or orderly. Until recently one would not ordinarily think of &apos;spark plug&apos; and &apos;computer&apos; as having closely connected meanings. but new electronic ignition systems in cars combine both in a single system. Biological systems are not so freely rearranged. t surprisingly, well determined meanings for words, diminishing the need for syntax to clarify or disambiguate meaning. Our search for an body of imowledge on which to explore certain hypotheses regarding such a nominal-attribute model in medicine led us to regard a familiar but little used resource in a new light. A corpus of computer readable disease definitions was seen to be a crude instantiation of the model. In this corpus each disease was given a name (a nominal), and defined by its (usually clinical) attributes the original motivation for the corpus being the standardization of disease nomenclature. The attributes were written in a telegraphic, but otherwise easily readable style, and organized, for each disease, in a relatively stable format a form we have chosen to call structured text. Superficially, the corpus had but one level of description, attributes of diseases. But each disease definition was divided, explicitly, into &amp;quot;contexts&amp;quot; (etiology. symptoms, ... lab. x-ray. ...). and each disease was place in one (or. at two) &amp;quot;body systems&amp;quot; (whole body, urogenital, ...). These contexts and systems were obviously strong, if imprecise, determiners of context. experiments this corpus. computer readable version of Mediand (CMIT), 4th [14 the selective and associative power of the words it employed, and confirmed our hypothesis that word use in it was both relatively consistent and systematic. We soon realized that the sharpest test of the ability of words to convey meaning in this context was to evaluate the corpus as a knowledge base for a &amp;quot;diagnoses program&amp;quot; which would accept a description of the patient in the form of a list of words, such as &apos;pain, fever, jaundice, ...&apos;. The specific diagnostic problem we addressed was of formulating a &amp;quot;differential [12, 15], which included, as alluded to by Scad- [21, 5], diseases that might not of, but, perhaps, should think of. Important to our attempt to formulate a diagnostic prompting program was not only that the knowledge base should be readily comprehensible, but. if the disease &amp;quot;prompts&amp;quot; were to be credible, the &amp;quot;reasoning&amp;quot; by which diseases were retrieved and ranked had to be equally accessible a consultative criterion noted by Shortliffe and co-workers [22,23]. addition, of a knowledge base containing in excess of 3000 disease descriptions has allowed us to study phenomena that would be hard to reproduce in the context most &amp;quot;expert For example, &amp;quot;differential diagnosis&amp;quot; is usually a list of diseases which represents the current thinking of a physician regarding poinible diagneees for a given patient, at a given point in the diagnostic process. sThat best know diagnoais program, an expert system named INTERNIST now called CADUCEUS, appended to this paper is a transcript of an with a case of methanol poisoning supplied by one of the authors (SN). None of the patient findings are specific. but the correct diagnosis in 6th place, and determines that most of the diseases near the top of the differential are &amp;quot;whole body&apos; diseases, a group containing most toxicity diseases. If this differential were selected from among a few hundred diseases, or even from a knowledge base of toxicity diseases, the result would be more open to a variety of less favorable interpretations. differently, is retrieving from such a large knowledge base, one is more tolerant about the appearance of &amp;quot;false positives&amp;quot; (diseases that shouldn&apos;t be there) in the interests of minimizing the number of &amp;quot;false negatives&amp;quot; (diseases that should be there, but are not). a test bed for the evaluation of some hypotheses regarding the kind of problems encountered representing and utilizing knowledge about the &apos;natural&apos;, as to &apos;artificial&apos;, world. Briefly, RECONfrom the high degree of structure observable in diagnostic medicine, in spite of our ignorance in many areas, and the otherwise generally unappreciated stability and specificity of medical language regarding this structure. Non-medical audiences should be reminded of differing expectations regarding such meaning representation experiments. As computer two of us &amp; &amp;quot;knew&amp;quot; that meaning could not be represented satisfactorily by words alone: words were ambiguous, in general. and, besides, syntax was a partner with semantics, and to separate the two was to distort the meaning of We regarded early efforts as potentially interesting from the point of view of statistical linguistics how did words and contexts associate? However, the medically trained member of the initial team (MSB) predicted the successful perforof he saw the results some experiments. Later, SN, an internist with a background in mathematics, anticipated the performance limaspect of ever using the program!

(The definition of appears in the appendix of this paper.) The &amp;quot;structure&amp;quot; imposed on CMIT definitions is largely external to the Language of those definitions. First, the entire text of CMIT is organized in the aforementioned nominal-attribute form, the disease names being the nominals and the descriptions consisting of the attributes of the disease.&apos; Second. each disease is assigned to one, or postwo, systems: whole body skin musculoskeletal respiratory cardiovascular hemic &amp; lymphatic gastrointestinal urogenital endocrine TUITIJOUS special sense organs each disease is described parts: terms &amp; eponyms) etiology symptoms signs complications Laboratory pathology x-ray references&apos; Fourth, within each part, the descending hierarof clauses, inferrable from punctuation) are used relatively consistently to denote appropriate &amp;quot;chunks&amp;quot; of meaning. Thus, in this instance, structured text is tightly edited prose written in nominal-attribute form, employing external markers, and relatively consistent punctuation, style, and vocabulary. Put differently. CMIT can be &amp;quot;structurally&amp;quot; without the need to of the semantics from the text. (Again, a portion of this &amp;quot;parse&amp;quot; is what produces the &amp;quot;display&amp;quot; of definition of alcohol, toxicity in the appendix.) are learning !ram ma evaluation, the names of even when they are descriptive names (as encourage), are not always sufficient to determine which disease is being spoken of. Without the descriptions (attributes) p&apos;nysician.s would be unable to resolve the problems created by different systems of disease nomenclature. ittiportant feature of the computer readable version of MIT is that it contains references, mention of which is not in the 4. The Current RECONSIDER Implementation 4.1. The Inverted File Using abstract syntax to represent the structure in the text. CMIT was scanned and &amp;quot;parsed&amp;quot; to produce a sequence of terms, each with the following attributes: ordinal position of term in phrase ordinal position of phrase in clause ordinal position of clause in sentence ordinal position of sentence in part name of part disease body system(s) of disease Thus, a dictionary (containing in excess of 20,000 such terms) was formed and CMIT so that each dictionary entry followed by pointers to every occurrence of that entry in CMIT. Included with every pointer were the seven attributes associated with each occurrence of that term- There are 333,211 term occurrences in CMIT, for an average of 102 terms per disease. or unique terms per disease, the difference being terms that are used more than once in a given definition. In principle. this &amp;quot;dictionary&amp;quot; could be used to reconstruct CMIT, as it represents, in alternaexactly the same This large inverted file allows efficient searching for terms in the text. The searches can be (1) constrained to a context (diseases of the skin), (2) constrained to textual proximity (adjacency. or membership within a clause). or (3) constrained to a definition part (symptoms only). 4.2. Synonym Dictionary term &amp;quot;synonym&amp;quot; includes words not in CMIT which are synonyms of words used in the CUIT definitions and words already in CMIT that are synonyms of each other pruritus and are partitioned amongst 4,165 &amp;quot;synonym classes&amp;quot; (the two or more words within each class are synonyms of each other). Search options allow searches with or without equivalencing the synonyms, and with or without invoking hierarchical synonyms. The term &amp;quot;synonym&amp;quot; is used generously, as the dictionary is actually functioning as a kind of semantic net connecting words with strong conceptual links. It should be noted that not employ &amp;quot;stemming&amp;quot;. All variants of a term (and some phrases. e.g. abdominal path), including. in some cases, mis-spellings, appear within a single &amp;quot;synonym class&amp;quot;. Though we have not proven this, it is our opinion that this synonym dictionary is what converts an interesting tool for research into medical term-use, into something &apos;Once again, this parse is not identifying &amp;quot;parts of speech&amp;quot; in the conventional sense. Rather the abstract syntax (a 3N7 grammar akin to those defining programming languages) encodes the meaning of the external markers and punctuational conventions employed in CIO. by Rodney and Hyo Kim M.D.. l .26 functions not unlike an expert system. 4.3. Searches Searches for a set of terms can require a match on every term, or a match on one or more of the terms in the set. In the latter case. matches are scored in a manner reminiscent of techniques used for literature and information retrieval by Salton. Sparck-Jones and others. and in particular Doszkocs (81. The scoring algorithm is illustrated in the next section. The an interactive user interface running on top of the inverted file and the search algorithms. it accepts terms, search modifiers, and requests for one of the two matching algorithms, formulates the appropriate query, searches the inverted files, computes the score of the diseases retrieved (if requested), constructs a body-system histogram (if requested), ranks the diseases if appropriate, and displays any disease definitions selected for viewing or browsing by the user. 5.

Comparison with two Diagnostic expert Systeme When applied to the published cases diagby PIP [20.17,18]. the correct diagnosis (or diagnoses) at, or near, the top of the disease list produced by entering the positive findings given to these programs [5].

While these cases were often complex, a large of information was available for each patient. 5.2. Diagnostic Prompting: An Example believe that better, and much more usefully, at an earlier point in the diagnostic process, at a time prior any extensive work-up, when the physician&apos;s &amp;quot;cognitive span&amp;quot; is widest [2]. For example, a patient presents with findings as noted at the beginning of the appenby prompting for The prefix / by the physicianuser to indicate that the succeeding terms are in either the of the disease This grouping, a union of the two vocabularies, was necessitated by the non-consistent usage of terms in these contexts.° The phrase abdominal will match (given the selected to run this case) any co-occurrence of these two words (or its synonyms) within a single the synonyms it knows for the terms entered, and use terms within CMIT did not. follow the medical as to what a symptom what was a sag&apos;s. the number of diseases containing one of more of each of the terms within the The response abdominal pain[ 80] indicates that the pair abdominal pain occurs in 191 diseases and that 80 additional diseases have been retrieved by the synonyms for abdompain, namely colicky[18], in fact that and 191+35+18+48 exceeds 191+180. indicates that some disease definitions contain more than one term from this synonym class. of selectivity) for abdominal pain is 0.917 = 1 &apos;(271/3262) where 271 is the number of &amp;quot;disease occurrences&amp;quot; of abdominal pain, and 3282 is the total number of diseases in CWT. A disease&apos;s score is the sum of the scores of the terms its description matched. Most physicians would probably conclude that the observation that the patient smoked was not relevant to the patient&apos;s illness, but the entered here to show its obvious effect on the disease list (it brings nicotine. marihuana nearer to the top, partly because it is so &amp;quot;selective&amp;quot;).

The histogram displays the body system frequencies for the diseases near the top of the disease list (the top 4Z was selected by the user to include about the first &amp;quot;screen&apos;s worth&amp;quot; of the disease list - 679 diseases containing one or more of the terms entered, or their synonyms). A physician-user viewing the first screenfull of this list (the portion shown in the appendix) would next formulate a strategy for resolving it, assuming the diagnosis was still not immediately apparent. A methodical approach would note first that no disease matched all five entries (as no disease has a score of 4.738). diseases #1. #2. and be ruled out by asking the patient appropriate questions.

Once considered, an appropriate test would confirm the existence of the toxic substance in the body. Experience have not permitted be used &amp;quot;live&amp;quot; in a clinical context. In addition to the fact that evaluation of the program is not complete, the knowledge base is known to be out of date. Nonetheless since we have been able to the MIS-UCSF VAX 11/750 running UN1X0 (Berkeley 4.1) students, postdoctoral fellows and some faculty have been able to use the program. The initial reaction usually of the following three observations: &amp;quot;Why is that disease there?&amp;quot; (sometimes it&apos;s legitimately, and sometimes not), does such a dumb program do so well?&amp;quot; (referto of evident reasoning power), and (3) &apos;&apos;What I need to be able to do now is ...&amp;quot; (fill in your favorite interactiveknowledge-base user-feature). We tolerate the problem alluded to by question (1) because it is more important, at this stage of development, not to miss important diseases, and because it is easier for a physician-user to reject totally inappropriate diseases than it is for the program to do so. to the point raised by the of this paper. only be an &amp;quot;expert&amp;quot; at all) its knowledge base is so large (relative to what a physician can keep readily available in his or her and because of It is obviously not like a human &amp;quot;expert&amp;quot; in the way it arrives at the disease list. And question (3) we take to be a compliment that reveals, among other things, that occasionally the utility of RECONSIDER is limited not by the knowledge it contains, but by the means we currently have of it through the narrow window of 23- CRT Question (1) deserves further comment, The author (MST) has observed considerable user-discomfort caused by CMIT mixing diseases from several body systems near the top of a UN1X is of Bell Telephone Laboratories, Inc. sorted disease list. Apparently, the cognityie dissonance is usually avoided by thinking about diseases by system. as the discomfort can be relieved by restricting the search (and thus the sorted list) to a single body system. The problem with the latter practice is that the preliminary results of ow evaluation reveals that con- (all/searches) the efficacious. on average. At this is also the opposite of the behavior predicted by our model of context in a nominal-attribute knowledge base, further study is suggested. In any case, it may prove necessary to re-design the user-interface to accomodate some users&apos; need to view deseases by sysa contextless search. 7. Evaluation. formal evaluation of 100 serial admissions to a tertiary care medical ward, is in progress (and will be reported elsewhere), but the preliminary results are both encouraging and interesting. They are encouraging because the correct diagnoses is included so often in the first frame or two (and usually higher), and interesting because the difference between diagnostic programs, and diagnostic prompting programs is made quite clear. The former have a very specific goal, and it is easy to tell whether it is reached or not. A prompting program is evaluated against a different standard: not whether it is correct but whether it is helpful. And judging whether something is helpful or not may be a subtle matter. If the correct diagnosis is included high on the list, the performance can be given a high score. But if, instead, a listed disease closely related to the correct one has the result of directing the physician&apos;s attention to the correct body system, and finally the correct diagnosis, how is this to be scored? 8. Suspected Limitations: 8.1. The Knowledge Base As has been the experience with similar projects, computer processing subjects &amp;quot;knowledge&amp;quot; to a harsh and unyielding light. We that a half a man-year significantly improve performance. but that the next and much more serious limitation will be the quality, uniformity, completeness, and timeliness of CMIT and the synonym dictionary. Given the opportunity to rewrite CMIT (and continue to do so on an onor Al techniques to have received suggeswe would the former. 8.2. Other limitaticas Our experience to date has taught us that. this context, negatives are Terms fever are tented as if a positive finding: while not fatal, such retrievals increase the number of false positives. Also users often wish to search using &amp;quot;rule-out&amp;quot;. e.g. diseases from consideration 128 a certain term, or terms. Especially tricky would be interactions between these two uses of negation. On a more global level. CMIT&apos;s homogenization of diseases contributes to confusion and loss of information. Congestive heart failure is as a disease under congesa symptom under heart, a sign under fatty degeneration aortic as a complication in, for exam- American. And illustrate the stress on the process of attempting to form a closed set of synonyms, the symptoms and signs of congestive heart failure are described at various points as in cardiomyopathy. but the phrase congestive heart failure does not occur in that description. 9. Future Implementations Given an opportunity to re-implement CMIT. we would retreat from our original notion that it should not be modified (so as to prove that structured text could be used, intact, as a knowledge base). Rather we would maintain the inverted files dynamically, in a relational database, so as to facilitate modifications, and experiments with alternative knowledge representations and retrieval techniques. Specifically, we would investigate the difficulty of re-writing CMIT to improve the quality and timeliness of the information it contained, to use a more standard model of disease nomenclature [1], to evaluate alternative ways of handling (such as jaundice the users to specify term occur, or not occur, in a disease description for it to be retrieved). requires some 20 MB of disk space. A dynamically revisable version would require at least twice that, making like an orphan elephant in already pressed medical computing environ- A &amp;quot;production&amp;quot; version of might fit in 15 MB. leaving two alternatives for future: running the large address-space micro-based systems now available with large hard disks, or making it available on a network. We are looking into both possibilities. 10. Conclusions In the context of medical diagnoses, and perhaps in other application areas, &amp;quot;structured text&amp;quot;, as defined here, has been neglected as a means of representing information in a form accessible to both humans and algorithms. If as Minsky has put it. &amp;quot;For a program, being smart is knowing a lot.&amp;quot;, then carefully edited and constructed natural language text, available in computer-readable form, may facilitate the process by which programs come to &amp;quot;know a lot&amp;quot; and continue to &amp;quot;know a lot&amp;quot; as the knowledge evolves over time. conclude by noting that ultimately of diagnostic aids such as RECONawait the verdict of users. If the cost and bother of their use is less than the benefit they are found to provide, we can expect them to make their way into clinical practice. Up until the present time, no diagnostic support program seems to have accomplished this. 11.

This large inverted file allows efficient searching for terms in the text. The searches can be (1) constrained to a context (diseases of the skin), (2) constrained to textual proximity (adjacency. or membership within a clause). or (3) constrained to a definition part (symptoms only). 4.2. Synonym Dictionary A 15,388 term &amp;quot;synonym&amp;quot; ciictionary3, includes words not in CMIT which are synonyms of words used in the CUIT definitions and words already in CMIT that are synonyms of each other (e.g. pruritus and itching).

In addition to the fact that evaluation of the program is not complete, the knowledge base is known to be out of date. Nonetheless since we have been able to move RECONSIDER to the MIS-UCSF VAX 11/750 running UN1X0 (Berkeley 4.1) students, postdoctoral fellows and some faculty have been able to use the program. The initial reaction usually consists of the following three observations: (1) &amp;quot;Why is that disease there?&amp;quot; (sometimes it&apos;s there legitimately, and sometimes not), (2) &amp;quot;How does such a dumb program do so well?&amp;quot; (referring to RECONSIDER&apos;s lack of evident reasoning power), and (3) &apos;&apos;What I need to be able to do now is ...&amp;quot; (fill in your favorite interactiveknowledge-base user-feature). We tolerate the problem alluded to by question (1) because it is more important, at this stage of development, not to miss important diseases, and because it is easier for a physician-user to reject totally inappropriate diseases than it is for the program to do so. Question (2) alludes to the point raised by the title of this paper. RECONSIDER can only be considered an &amp;quot;expert&amp;quot; (if at all) because its knowledge base is so large (relative to what a physician can keep readily available in</context>

Performance 5.1. A. Comparison with two Diagnostic expert Systeme When applied to the published cases diagnosed by INTERNIST and PIP [20.17,18]. RECONSIDER produced the correct diagnosis (or diagnoses) at, or near, the top of the disease list produced by entering the positive findings given to these programs [5]. (Again, CADUCEUS considers 300 diseases from internal medicine, and PIP considers 20 diseases featuring edema.) While these cases were often complex, a large amount of clinical information was available for each patient. 5.2. Diagnostic Prompting: An Example We believe that RECONSIDER performs better, and much more usefully, at an earlier point in the diagnostic process, at a time prior to any extensive patient work-up, when the physician&apos;s &amp;quot;cognitive span&amp;quot; is widest [2]. For example, a patient presents with findings as noted at the beginning of the appendix. RECONSIDER begins by prompting f</context>
