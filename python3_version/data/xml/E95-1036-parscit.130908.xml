This paper presents an analysis of tem-
poral anaphora in sentences which con-
tain quantification over events, within
the framework of Discourse Representa-
tion Theory. The analysis in (Partee,
1984) of quantified sentences, introduced
by a temporal connective, gives the
wrong truth-conditions when the tempo-
ral connective in the subordinate clause
is before or after. This problem has been
previously analyzed in (de Swart, 1991)
as an instance of the proportion problem,
and given a solution from a Generalized
Quantifier approach. By using a care-
ful distinction between the different no-
tions of reference time, based on (Kamp
and Reyle, 1993), we propose a solu-
tion to this problem, within the frame-
work of DRT. We show some applica-
tions of this solution to additional tem-
poral anaphora phenomena in quantified
sentences.

The analysis of temporal expressions in natural
language discourse provides a challenge for con-
temporary semantic theories. (Partee, 1973) in-
troduced the notion of temporal anaphora, to ac-
count for ways in which temporal expressions de-
pend on surrounding elements in the discourse for
their semantic contribution to the discourse. In
this paper, we discuss the interaction of tempo-
ral anaphora and quantification over eventualities.
Such interaction, while interesting in its own right,
is also a good test-bed for theories of the semantic
interpretation of temporal expressions. We dis-
cuss cases such as:

The analysis of sentences such as (1) in (Partee,
1984), within the framework of Discourse Repre-
sentation Theory (DRT) (Kamp, 1981) gives the
wrong truth-conditions, when the temporal con-
nective in the sentence is before or after. In DRT,
such sentences trigger box-splitting with the even-
tuality of the subordinate clause and an updated
reference time in the antecedent box, and the
eventuality of the main clause in the consequent
box, causing undesirable universal quantification
over the reference time.
This problem is analyzed in (de Swart, 1991) as
an instance of the proportion problem and given a
solution from a Generalized Quantifier approach.
We were led to seek a solution for this problem
within DRT, because of DRT&apos;s advantages as a
general theory of discourse, and its choice as the
underlying formalism in another research project
of ours, which deals with sentences such as 1-4,
in the context of natural language specifications
of computerized systems. In this paper, we pro-
pose such a solution, based on a careful distinction
between different roles of Reichenbach&apos;s reference
time (Reichenbach, 1947), adapted from (Kamp
and Reyle, 1993). Figure 1 shows a &apos;minimal pair&apos;
of DRS&apos;s for sentence 1, one according to Par-
tee&apos;s(1984) analysis and one according to ours.

An analysis of the mechanism of temporal
anaphoric reference hinges upon an understand-
ing of the ontological and logical foundations of
temporal reference. Different concepts have been
used in the literature as primitives. These range
from temporal instants in Tense logic (Prior, 67),
through intervals of time (Bennet and Partee,
1978(1972)) as in the analysis of temporal con-
nectives in (Heinamaki, 1978), to event structures
(Kamp, 1979) as in Hinrichs&apos; (1986) analysis of
temporal anaphora.

An important factor in the interpretation of
temporal expressions is the classification of situ-
ations into different aspectual classes (or Aktion-
sarten), which is based on distributional and se-
mantic properties. In this paper, we only consider
events and states, together termed eventualities
in (Bach, 1981). In narrative sequences, event
clauses seem to advance the narrative time, while
states block its progression. The mechanism used
to account for this phenomena in (Hinrichs, 1986)
and (Partee, 1984), is based on the notion of ref-
erence time, originally proposed by Reichenbach
(1947).
Reichenbach&apos;s well - known account of the inter-
pretation of the different tense forms uses the tem-
poral relations between three temporal indices:
the utterance time, event time and reference time.
The reference time according to (Reichenbach,
1947) is determined either by context, or by tem-
poral adverbials.

2.1 A unified analysis of temporal
anaphora
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.985607304347826">
Hinrichs&apos; and Partee&apos;s use of a notion of refer-
ence time, provides for a unified treatment of tem-
poral anaphoric relations in discourse, which in-
clude narrative progression especially in sequences
of simple past tense sentences, temporal adverbs
and temporal adverbial clauses, introduced by a
temporal connective. This concept of reference
time is no longer an instant of time, but rather,
an interval. This approach can be summarized
as follows: in the processing of a discourse, the
discourse-initial sentence is argued to require some
contextually determined reference time. Further
event clauses in the discourse introduce a new
event, which is included within the then-current
reference time. Each such event also causes the
reference time to be updated to a time &apos;just after&apos;
(Partee, 1984) this event. State clauses introduce
new states, which include the current reference
time, and do not update it.
As an example of such an analysis consider the
following narrative discourse (Partee, 1984):
(5) John got up, went to the window, and raised
the blind. It was light out. He pulled the blind
down and went back to bed. He wasn&apos;t ready
to face the day. He was too depressed.
Figure 2 shows a DRS for the first two sen-
tences of this discourse, according to Hinrichs&apos; and
Partee&apos;s analysis. The &apos;n&apos; in the top DRS is a
mnemonic for `now&apos;- the utterance time. The first
event in the discourse, ei — John&apos;s getting up — is
interpreted relative to a contextually understood
reference time, ro. The event ei is included in the
current reference time, 7-0. A new reference time
marker, ri is then introduced. ri lies immediately
after 7.0 (recorded as ro ri). ri serves as the cur-
rent reference time for the following event e2. We
continue in this fashion, updating the reference
time, until the second sentence in the discourse
is processed. This sentence denotes a state, si ,
which includes the then-current reference time.

Adverbial phrases, whether phrasal (e.g. &apos;On
Sunday&apos;) or clausal (e.g. &apos;When Bill left&apos;), are pro-
cessed before the main clause. They introduce a
reference time, which overrides the current refer-
ence time, and provides an anaphoric antecedent
for the tense in the main clause. This mechanism
is used to explain how tense and temporal adver-
bials can combine to temporally locate the occur-
rence, without running into problems of relative
scope (Hinrichs, 1988). The tense morpheme of
the main clause locates the event time with re-
spect to the reference time, whereas temporal ad-
verbials are used to locate the reference time.
When-clauses, for example, introduce a new ref-
erence time, which is ordered after the events de-
scribed in the preceding discourse. The eventual-
ity in the when-clause is related to this reference
time as discussed earlier with respect to narrative
progression: a state includes its reference time,
while an event is included in it. The eventuality
in the main clause is interpreted with respect to
this reference time. If the main clause is an event-

just after the event time of the main clause. As an

2.2 Quantification over events
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999247285714286">
(Partee, 1984) extends Hinrichs&apos; treatment of tem-
poral anaphora to the analysis of sentences, which
contain a temporal adverbial and quantification
over eventualities. According to her analysis,
these trigger box-splitting as do if or every clauses
in DRT (Kamp, 1981). Consider the following ex-
ample from (Partee, 1984):
</bodyText>

(7) Whenever Mary telephoned, Sam was asleep.
</listItem>
<figureCaption confidence="0.990594">
Figure 4:

<bodyText confidence="0.9694305">
The subordinate clause cannot be interpreted
relative to a single reference time, since Mary&apos;s
telephoning is not specified to occur at some spe-
cific time. Still, the sentence needs to be inter-
preted relative to a reference time. This reference
time can be a large interval, and should contain
each of the relevant occurrences of Mary&apos;s tele-
phoning during which Bill was asleep. This refer-
ence time is represented as 7.0 in the top sub-DRS.
The &apos;whenever&apos; triggers box-splitting. The
event marker - el is introduced in the antecedent
box, with the condition that it be temporally in-
cluded in the current reference time, ro and be
prior to n. The &apos;whenever&apos; also causes the intro-
duction of r1, a new reference time marker. r1 lies
&apos;just after&apos; ei . The stative clause causes the intro-
duction of si , which includes the reference time
ri
The embedding conditions for the whole con-
struction are just like those for a regular &apos;if&apos; or
&apos;every&apos; clause, i.e. the sentence is true, if every
proper embedding of the antecedent box can be
extended to a proper embedding of the combina-
tion of the antecedent and the consequent boxes.
This means, as desired, that for each choice of
an event el of Mary&apos;s telephoning, and reference
time r1 &apos;just after&apos; it, there is a state of Sam&apos;s
being asleep, that surrounds ri
A sentence such as (7a) which is the same as
sentence 7, except the &apos;whenever&apos; is replaced by
&apos;when&apos;, and &apos;always&apos; is added in the main clause,
would get the same DRS.

asleep.

2.3 Extending the analysis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999977615384616">
As noted in (Partee, 1984), this analysis does not
extend in a straightforward manner to cases in
which the operator when is replaced by (an un-
restricted) before or after, in such quantified con-
texts. Constructing a similar DRS for such sen-
tences gives the wrong truth conditions. For ex-
ample, Figure la shows a DRS for sentence 1,
according to the principles above. r1 - the ref-
erence time, used for the interpretation of the
main clause is placed in the universe of the an-
tecedent box. Because the temporal connective
is &apos;before&apos;, r1 is restricted to lie before el. The
embedding conditions determine, that this refer-
ence time be universally quantified over, causing
an erroneous reading in which for each event, ei
of John&apos;s calling, for each earlier time 7.1, he lights
up a cigarette. Paraphrasing this, we could say
that John lights up cigarettes at all times preced-
ing each phone call, not just once preceding each
phone call. We did not encounter this problem
in the DRS in Figure 4, since although the refer-
ence time r1, is universally quantified over in that
DRS as well, it is also restricted, to immediately
follow e1. It is similarly restricted if &apos;before&apos; is re-
placed with &apos;just before&apos; or &apos;ten minutes before&apos;.
But, (unrestricted) &apos;before&apos; is analyzed as &apos;some
time before&apos;, and thus the problem arises. We
will henceforth informally refer to this problem as
Partee&apos;s quantification problem.
Partee (1984) suggests that in these cases we
somehow have to insure that the reference time,
r1, appears in the universe of the consequent DRS,
causing it to be existentially quantified over, giv-
ing the desired interpretation. De Swart (1991)
notes that simply moving ri to the right-hand box
does not agree with Hinrichs&apos; assumption, that
temporal clauses are processed before the main
clause, since they update the reference time, with
respect to which the main clause will be inter-

3 The proportion problem
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99770675">
De Swart (1991) sees Partee&apos;s quantification prob-
lem as a temporal manifestation of the proportion
problem, which arises in cases such as (Kadmon,
1990):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.878604">
(8) Most women who own a cat are happy.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999967590909091">
The sentence is false in the case where out of
ten women, one owns 50 cats and is happy, while
the other nine women own only one cat each, and
are miserable. This will not be predicted by the
unselective binding of quantifiers in DRT, which
quantify over all the free variables in their scope,
in this case women-cat pairs. According to (de
Swart, 1991) Partee&apos;s quantification problem is
similar - the universal quantifier in sentences such
as (1) binds pairs of events and updated reference
times, where the desired quantificational scheme
is universal quantification for the event and exis-
tential for the reference time.
De Swart (1991) offers a solution from a Gener-
alized Quantifier approach, based on the analysis
of quantified NPs in transitive sentences. In this
analysis, the reference time is an implicit variable,
which is needed in the interpretation of the tempo-
ral relation, but is not part of the quantificational
structure.
Temporal connectives are viewed as relations,
TC, between two sets of events:

<listItem confidence="0.549261">
(9) {&lt; e1,e2 &gt; 1&lt; el, e2 &gt;E TC}
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9993858">
The quantificational structure of such sentences
can be analyzed either by an iteration of monadic
quantifiers, or as a single dyadic quantifier of type
&lt; 1, 1, 2 &gt;. In the first approach, adverbs of quan-
tification (Q-adverbs) are assigned the structure:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.92458">
(10) Q(S,, {e113(S,„,TC,,)})
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999872428571429">
In 10, S, and Sm denote, respectively, the sets
of events described by the subordinate and the
main clause, TC„ denotes the image set of el un-
der the temporal connective TC, i.e. the set of
events e2 which are related to el via the relation
TC, (presented in 9). In the second approach, the
structure is:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.634694">
(11) [Q, 3](S., Sy, TC)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9493062">
De Swart&apos;s solution does overcome Partee&apos;s
quantification problem, although not within DRT.
As such, the existential quantification in 11 has to
be stipulated, whereas our analysis acquires this
existential quantification &apos;for free&apos;.

4 Splitting the role of reference
time
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.957212833333333">
Our analysis of Partee&apos;s quantification problem
uses a different notion of reference time than that
used by the accounts in the exposition above. Fol-
lowing (Kamp and Reyle, 1993), we split the role
of the reference time, used to account for a large
array of phenomena, into several independent
mechanisms. This separation allows for an anal-
ysis in DRT of temporal subordinate clauses in
quantified sentences, which avoids Partee&apos;s prob-
lem altogether. The mechanisms we discuss are:
the location time, Rpt and pert&apos;. DRSs will
contain temporal markers corresponding to loca-
tion times and Rpts.
The location time is an interval, used to tem-
porally locate eventualities, in accordance with
their aspectual classification. Events are included
in their location time (recorded in the DRS as
e C t on the respective markers), while states
temporally overlap their location time (recorded
as s 0 t). The verb tense determines the relation
between the location time and the utterance time
e.g. if the tense is simple past, the location time
lies anteriorly to the utterance time. When it is
simple present, the location time coincides with
the utterance time2. Temporal adverbials restrict
the location time: temporal adverbs introduce a
DRS-condition on the location time, while tem-
poral subordinate clauses introduce a relation be-
tween the event time3 of the subordinate clause
and the location time of the main clause. The ex-
act temporal relation denoted by a temporal con-
nective depends on the aspectual classes of the
eventualities related by it4. For example, in the
following sentence 12, the event triggers the intro-
duction of an event marker e, and location time
marker t, into the DRS with the DRS-condition
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.986864571428571">
e C t. The past tense of the verb adds the con-
dition t &lt; n. In sentence 13, the location time of
the event in the main clause is restricted to fall
(just) after the event time of the event of the sub-
ordinate clause.
(12) Mary wrote the letter.
(13) Mary wrote the letter when Bill left.

<bodyText confidence="0.837699">
&apos;An additional mechanism is the TPpt, which for
simplicity&apos;s sake will not be discussed in this paper.

<footnote confidence="0.962278307692308">
2Since the utterance time, n is a point in (Kamp
and Reyle, 1993), the overlap relation between a state
that holds in the present and n reduces to inclusion.
3The event time t of an eventuality e is the smallest
interval which includes e (recorded as t = loc(e)).
4For the sake of the current presentation, we as-
sume the following relations for When: if both the
when-clause and the main clause denote states, then
their respective time indices overlap. If both are
events then the times are temporally close, with the
exact relation undetermined. When one is a state and
one an event, then the time index of the state includes
that of the event cf. (Hinrichs, 1986).

<bodyText confidence="0.999939482758621">
Narrative progression is dealt with by using the
feature Rpt (or reference point). The Rpt can
be either an event or a time discourse marker, al-
ready present in the DRS (recorded as assignment
Rpt := e). Eventualities are interpreted with re-
spect to the Rpt - events are taken to follow the
current Rpt, while states include it. The Rpt is
reset during the processing of the discourse. Note
that in a &apos;terminal&apos; DRS (ready for an embedding
test), all the auxiliary Rpts &apos;disappear&apos; (do not
participate in the embedding).
The perfect is analyzed by using the notion of a
nucleus (Moens and Steedman, 1988) to account
for the inner structure of an eventuality. A nucleus
is defined as a structure containing a preparatory
process, culmination and consequent state. The
categorization of verb phrases into different as-
pectual classes can be phrased in terms of which
part of the nucleus they refer to. The perfect is
seen in (Kamp and Reyle, 1993) as an aspectual
operator. The eventualities described by the per-
fect of a verb refer to the consequent state of its
nucleus. For example, the following sentence 14
denotes the state, s, holding at the present, that
Mary has met the president. This state is a result
of the event e, in which Mary met the president..
Temporally, the state s starts just when e ends,
or as it is put in (Kamp and Reyle, 1993):e and s
abut, (represented as e Xs).

5 An alternative solution
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999986244444444">
By extending the analysis of temporal subordinate
clauses in (Kamp and Reyle, 1993), to sentences
which include quantification over eventualities, we
can propose an alternative DRT solution to Par-
tee&apos;s quantification problem. As in (Partee, 1984),
such sentences trigger box-splitting. But now, the
location time of the eventuality in the subordi-
nate clause serves as the antecedent for the loca-
tion time of the eventuality in the main clause.
In this approach, each of the relevant temporal
markers resides in its appropriate box, yielding
the correct quantificational structure. This quan-
tification structure does not need to be stipulated
as part of the Q-adverb&apos;s meaning, but arises di-
rectly from the temporal system. We illustrate
this analysis by constructing a DRS in Figure lb
for sentence 1.
In this DRS, n denotes the utterance time. The
subordinate clause triggers the introduction of an
event marker, e, with its event time marker t.
The main clause triggers the introduction of an
event marker e&apos;, and its location time marker t&apos;,
with the DRS-condition e&apos; C t&apos;. The assymetry in
using the event time for e and the location time
for e&apos; arises from the interpretation rules of tem-,
poral connectives (for both quantified and non-
quantified sentences). Since the temporal connec-
tive in this sentence is before, the relation between
these two markers is one of precedence.
We adopt a suggestion by Chierchia in (Partee,
1984), that the whole implication be rendered as
a state. This state is no longer an atomic eventu-
ality. It is a complex state denoting John&apos;s habit.
This state holds during the present, and so its lo-
cation time is n.
This solution is not prone to de Swart&apos;s (1991)
criticism against the naive solution of moving the
reference time to the right DRS. The temporal
clause may be processed before the main clause,
since t&apos;, the location time of e&apos;, which &apos;replaces&apos;
7.1, the reference time of Partee&apos;s analysis, as the
temporal index of the eventuality in the the main
clause, arises from processing the main clause (not
updating the reference time of the subordinate
clause).

6 Additional phenomena
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999986675">
In this section we present some applications of our
analysis to related constructions. First, we con-
sider the past perfect, as in sentence 2. De Swart
(1991) gives this example to illustrate the inability
to interpret temporal connectives without the use
of the reference times. According to (de Swart,
1991), the subordinate clause determines the ref-
erence time of the verb, which lies anteriorly to the
event time. Trying to use the event times would
give the wrong analysis. This would seem to be
troublesome for our approach, which uses the loca-
tion time of the event in the main clause, and not
its reference time. However, this is not a problem,
since our analysis of the perfect by the use of the
operator perf, analyses the eventuality referred to
by the main clause, as the result state of a previ-
ous event. The temporal relation in the sentence
is inclusion between the event time of Anne&apos;s com-
ing home, and the location time of the result state
of Paul&apos;s already having prepared dinner.
Next, we consider narrative progression in
quantified contexts, as in sentence 3. The basic
construction is just the same as in the paradigm
structure, but now we have narrative progression
in the consequent box. This narrative progres-
sion is handled as ordinary narrative progression
in (Kamp and Reyle, 1993), i.e. by resetting the
Rpt. The DRS in Figure 5 describes the complex
state si , that after each event of John&apos;s coming
home, there is a sequence of subsequent events
according to his activities.
Finally, we deal with sentences such as (4),
which contain an iteration of an implicit generic
quantifier and always. The situation described by
John&apos;s always squinting when the sun is shining is
analyzed as a complex state 83. This state holds
whenever John is at the beach, recorded by the
condition that the location time t2 of 83 overlaps
the event time, ti of John&apos;s being at the beach, 82
in Figure 6.

The analysis in (Partee, 1984) of quantified sentences, introduced by a temporal connective, gives the wrong truth-conditions when the temporal connective in the subordinate clause problem has been previously analyzed in (de Swart, 1991) an instance of the problem, and given a solution from a Generalized Quantifier approach. By using a careful distinction between the different noof time, on (Kamp and Reyle, 1993), we propose a solution to this problem, within the framework of DRT. We show some applications of this solution to additional temporal anaphora phenomena in quantified sentences.</abstract>

If both are events then the times are temporally close, with the exact relation undetermined. When one is a state and one an event, then the time index of the state includes that of the event cf. (Hinrichs, 1986). 264 Narrative progression is dealt with by using the feature Rpt (or reference point). The Rpt can be either an event or a time discourse marker, already present in the DRS (recorded as assignment Rpt := e). Eventualities are interpreted with respect to the Rpt - events are taken to follow the current Rpt, while states include it. The Rpt is reset during the processing of the discourse. Note that in a &apos;terminal&apos; DRS (ready for an embedding test), all the auxiliary Rpts &apos;disappear&apos; (do not participate in the embedding).

This mechanism is used to explain how tense and temporal adverbials can combine to temporally locate the occurrence, without running into problems of relative scope (Hinrichs, 1988). The tense morpheme of the main clause locates the event time with respect to the reference time, whereas temporal adverbials are used to locate the reference time. When-clauses, for example, introduce a new reference time, which is ordered after the events described in the preceding discourse. The eventuality in the when-clause is related to this reference time as discussed earlier with respect to narrative progression: a state includes its reference time, while an event is included in it.

The sentence is false in the case where out of ten women, one owns 50 cats and is happy, while the other nine women own only one cat each, and are miserable. This will not be predicted by the unselective binding of quantifiers in DRT, which quantify over all the free variables in their scope, in this case women-cat pairs. According to (de Swart, 1991) Partee&apos;s quantification problem is similar - the universal quantifier in sentences such as (1) binds pairs of events and updated reference times, where the desired quantificational scheme is universal qua</context>

The analysis in (Partee, 1984) of quantified sentences, introduced by a temporal connective, gives the wrong truth-conditions when the temporal connective in the subordinate clause is before or after. This problem has been previously analyzed in (de Swart, 1991) as an instance of the proportion problem, and given a solution from a Generalized Quantifier approach. By using a careful distinction between the different notions of reference time, based on (Kamp and Reyle, 1993), we propose a solution to this problem, within the framework of DRT. We show some applications of this solution to additional temporal anaphora phenomena in quantified sentences. 1 Introduction The analysis of temporal expressions in natural language discourse provides a challenge for contemporary semantic theories. (Partee, 1973) introduced the notion of temporal anaphora, to account for ways in which temporal expressions depend on surrounding elements in the discourse for their semantic contribution to the discourse. In this paper, we discuss the interaction of temporal anaphora and quantif</context>

We were led to seek a solution for this problem within DRT, because of DRT&apos;s advantages as a general theory of discourse, and its choice as the underlying formalism in another research project of ours, which deals with sentences such as 1-4, in the context of natural language specifications of computerized systems. In this paper, we propose such a solution, based on a careful distinction between different roles of Reichenbach&apos;s reference time (Reichenbach, 1947), adapted from (Kamp and Reyle, 1993). Figure 1 shows a &apos;minimal pair&apos; of DRS&apos;s for sentence 1, one according to Partee&apos;s(1984) analysis and one according to ours. 2 Background An analysis of the mechanism of temporal anaphoric reference hinges upon an understanding of the ontological and logical foundations of temporal reference. Different concepts have been used in the literature as primitives. These range from temporal instants in Tense logic (Prior, 67), through intervals of time (Bennet and Partee, 1978(1972)) as in the analysis of temporal connectives in (Heinamaki, 1978), to event structures (Kamp, 1979) as in Hinrichs&apos; (1</context>

In the second approach, the structure is: (11) [Q, 3](S., Sy, TC) De Swart&apos;s solution does overcome Partee&apos;s quantification problem, although not within DRT. As such, the existential quantification in 11 has to be stipulated, whereas our analysis acquires this existential quantification &apos;for free&apos;. 4 Splitting the role of reference time Our analysis of Partee&apos;s quantification problem uses a different notion of reference time than that used by the accounts in the exposition above. Following (Kamp and Reyle, 1993), we split the role of the reference time, used to account for a large array of phenomena, into several independent mechanisms. This separation allows for an analysis in DRT of temporal subordinate clauses in quantified sentences, which avoids Partee&apos;s problem altogether. The mechanisms we discuss are: the location time, Rpt and pert&apos;. DRSs will contain temporal markers corresponding to location times and Rpts. The location time is an interval, used to temporally locate eventualities, in accordance with their aspectual classification. Events are included in their location time (recorded in the</context>
<context position="17034" citStr="Kamp and Reyle, 1993" startWordPosition="2858" endWordPosition="2861"> For example, in the following sentence 12, the event triggers the introduction of an event marker e, and location time marker t, into the DRS with the DRS-condition e C t. The past tense of the verb adds the condition t &lt; n. In sentence 13, the location time of the event in the main clause is restricted to fall (just) after the event time of the event of the subordinate clause. (12) Mary wrote the letter. (13) Mary wrote the letter when Bill left. &apos;An additional mechanism is the TPpt, which for simplicity&apos;s sake will not be discussed in this paper. 2Since the utterance time, n is a point in (Kamp and Reyle, 1993), the overlap relation between a state that holds in the present and n reduces to inclusion. 3The event time t of an eventuality e is the smallest interval which includes e (recorded as t = loc(e)). 4For the sake of the current presentation, we assume the following relations for When: if both the when-clause and the main clause denote states, then their respective time indices overlap. If both are events then the times are temporally close, with the exact relation undetermined. When one is a state and one an event, then the time index of the state includes that of the event cf.

The perfect is seen in (Kamp and Reyle, 1993) as an aspectual operator. The eventualities described by the perfect of a verb refer to the consequent state of its nucleus. For example, the following sentence 14 denotes the state, s, holding at the present, that Mary has met the president. This state is a result of the event e, in which Mary met the president.. Temporally, the state s starts just when e ends, or as it is put in (Kamp and Reyle, 1993):e and s abut, (represented as e Xs).

This problem has been previously analyzed in (de Swart, 1991) as an instance of the proportion problem, and given a solution from a Generalized Quantifier approach. By using a careful distinction between the different notions of reference time, based on (Kamp and Reyle, 1993), we propose a solution to this problem, within the framework of DRT. We show some applications of this solution to additional temporal anaphora phenomena in quantified sentences. 1 Introduction The analysis of temporal expressions in natural language discourse provides a challenge for contemporary semantic theories. (Partee, 1973) introduced the notion of temporal anaphora, to account for ways in which temporal expressions depend on surrounding elements in the discourse for their semantic contribution to the discourse. In this paper, we discuss the interaction of temporal anaphora and quantification over eventualities. Such interaction, while interesting in its own right, is also a good test-bed for theories of the semantic interpretation of temporal expressions. We discuss cases such as: (1) Before John makes a phone call, he always lights up a cigarette. (Partee, 1984) (2) Often, when Anne came home late, Paul had al</context>

(Partee, 1973) introduced the notion of temporal anaphora, to account for ways in which temporal expressions depend on surrounding elements in the discourse for their semantic contribution to the discourse. In this paper, we discuss the interaction of temporal anaphora and quantification over eventualities. Such interaction, while interesting in its own right, is also a good test-bed for theories of the semantic interpretation of temporal expressions. We discuss cases such as: (1) Before John makes a phone call, he always lights up a cigarette. (Partee, 1984) (2) Often, when Anne came home late, Paul had already prepared dinner. (de Swart, 1991) (3) When he came home, he always switched on the tv. He took a beer and sat down in his armchair to forget the day. (de Swart, 1991) (4) When John is at the beach, he always squints when the sun is shining. (de Swart, 1991) The analysis of sentences such as (1) in (Partee, 1984), within the framework of Discourse Representation Theory (DRT) (Kamp, 1981) gives the wrong truth-conditions, when the temporal connective in the sentence is before or after. In DRT, such sentences trigger box-splitting with the ev</context>

In this paper, we only consider events and states, together termed eventualities in (Bach, 1981). In narrative sequences, event clauses seem to advance the narrative time, while states block its progression. The mechanism used to account for this phenomena in (Hinrichs, 1986) and (Partee, 1984), is based on the notion of reference time, originally proposed by Reichenbach (1947). Reichenbach&apos;s well - known account of the interpretation of the different tense forms uses the temporal relations between three temporal indices: the utterance time, event time and reference time. The reference time according to (Reichenbach, 1947) is determined either by context, or by temporal adverbials. 2.1 A unified analysis of temporal anaphora Hinrichs&apos; and Partee&apos;s use of a notion of reference time, provides for a unified treatment of temporal anaphoric relations in discourse, which include narrative</context>
<context position="5848" citStr="Partee, 1984" startWordPosition="939" endWordPosition="940">in sequences of simple past tense sentences, temporal adverbs and temporal adverbial clauses, introduced by a temporal connective. This concept of reference time is no longer an instant of time, but rather, an interval. This approach can be summarized as follows: in the processing of a discourse, the discourse-initial sentence is argued to require some contextually determined reference time. Further event clauses in the discourse introduce a new event, which is included within the then-current reference time. Each such event also causes the reference time to be updated to a time &apos;just after&apos; (Partee, 1984) this event. State clauses introduce new states, which include the current reference time, and do not update it. As an example of such an analysis consider the following narrative discourse (Partee, 1984): (5) John got up, went to the window, and raised the blind. It was light out. He pulled the blind down and went back to bed. He wasn&apos;t ready to face the day. He was too depressed. Figure 2 shows a DRS for the first two sentences of this discourse, according to Hinrichs&apos; and Partee&apos;s analysis. The &apos;n&apos; in the top DRS is a mnemonic for `now&apos;- the utterance time. The first event in the discourse,</context>
<context position="8337" citStr="Partee, 1984" startWordPosition="1378" endWordPosition="1379">example, introduce a new reference time, which is ordered after the events described in the preceding discourse. The eventuality in the when-clause is related to this reference time as discussed earlier with respect to narrative progression: a state includes its reference time, while an event is included in it. The eventuality in the main clause is interpreted with respect to this reference time. If the main clause is an event262 ro r2 r3 Figure 3: clause, this event introduces a new reference time, just after the event time of the main clause. As an example, consider the following discourse (Partee, 1984): (6) Mary turned the corner. When John saw her, she crossed the street. She hurried into a store. Following Partee (1984), we will not construct a full DRS for this discourse, but illustrate it with a diagram in Figure 3, with circles denoting inclusion. 2.2 Quantification over events (Partee, 1984) extends Hinrichs&apos; treatment of temporal anaphora to the analysis of sentences, which contain a temporal adverbial and quantification over eventualities. According to her analysis, these trigger box-splitting as do if or every clauses in DRT (Kamp, 1981). Consider the following example from (Partee</context>
<context position="10575" citStr="Partee, 1984" startWordPosition="1762" endWordPosition="1763">nce is true, if every proper embedding of the antecedent box can be extended to a proper embedding of the combination of the antecedent and the consequent boxes. This means, as desired, that for each choice of an event el of Mary&apos;s telephoning, and reference time r1 &apos;just after&apos; it, there is a state of Sam&apos;s being asleep, that surrounds ri A sentence such as (7a) which is the same as sentence 7, except the &apos;whenever&apos; is replaced by &apos;when&apos;, and &apos;always&apos; is added in the main clause, would get the same DRS. (7a) When Mary telephoned, Sam was always asleep. 2.3 Extending the analysis As noted in (Partee, 1984), this analysis does not extend in a straightforward manner to cases in which the operator when is replaced by (an unrestricted) before or after, in such quantified contexts. Constructing a similar DRS for such sentences gives the wrong truth conditions. For example, Figure la shows a DRS for sentence 1, according to the principles above. r1 - the reference time, used for the interpretation of the main clause is placed in the universe of the antecedent box. Because the temporal connective is &apos;before&apos;, r1 is restricted to lie before el. The embedding conditions determine, that this reference ti</context>
<context position="11969" citStr="Partee (1984)" startWordPosition="1999" endWordPosition="2000">, we could say that John lights up cigarettes at all times preceding each phone call, not just once preceding each phone call. We did not encounter this problem in the DRS in Figure 4, since although the reference time r1, is universally quantified over in that DRS as well, it is also restricted, to immediately follow e1. It is similarly restricted if &apos;before&apos; is replaced with &apos;just before&apos; or &apos;ten minutes before&apos;. But, (unrestricted) &apos;before&apos; is analyzed as &apos;some time before&apos;, and thus the problem arises. We will henceforth informally refer to this problem as Partee&apos;s quantification problem. Partee (1984) suggests that in these cases we somehow have to insure that the reference time, r1, appears in the universe of the consequent DRS, causing it to be existentially quantified over, giving the desired interpretation. De Swart (1991) notes that simply moving ri to the right-hand box does not agree with Hinrichs&apos; assumption, that temporal clauses are processed before the main clause, since they update the reference time, with respect to which the main clause will be intern z y ro Mary(y) Sam(x) el r1 el C ro el &lt;n el -‹ r1 r1 &lt;n el: y telephone sleep 263 preted. In our proposed solution, the &apos;refe</context>
<context position="19335" citStr="Partee, 1984" startWordPosition="3259" endWordPosition="3260">, the following sentence 14 denotes the state, s, holding at the present, that Mary has met the president. This state is a result of the event e, in which Mary met the president.. Temporally, the state s starts just when e ends, or as it is put in (Kamp and Reyle, 1993):e and s abut, (represented as e Xs). (14) Mary has met the president. 5 An alternative solution By extending the analysis of temporal subordinate clauses in (Kamp and Reyle, 1993), to sentences which include quantification over eventualities, we can propose an alternative DRT solution to Partee&apos;s quantification problem. As in (Partee, 1984), such sentences trigger box-splitting. But now, the location time of the eventuality in the subordinate clause serves as the antecedent for the location time of the eventuality in the main clause. In this approach, each of the relevant temporal markers resides in its appropriate box, yielding the correct quantificational structure. This quantification structure does not need to be stipulated as part of the Q-adverb&apos;s meaning, but arises directly from the temporal system. We illustrate this analysis by constructing a DRS in Figure lb for sentence 1. In this DRS, n denotes the utterance time. T</context>
