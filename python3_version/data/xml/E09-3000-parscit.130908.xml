On behalf of the Programme Committee, we are pleased to present the proceedings of the Student
Research Workshop held at the 12th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for
Computational Linguistics. Following the tradition of providing a forum for student researchers and
the success of the previous workshops held in Bergen (1999), Toulouse (2001), Budapest (2003) and
Trento (2006), a panel of senior researchers will take part in the presentation of the papers, providing
detailed comments on the work of the authors.
The Student Workshop will run as four parallel sessions, during which 11 papers will be presented. These
high standard papers were carefully chosen from a total of 38 submissions coming from 18 countries.
We would like to take this opportunity to thank the many people that have contributed in various ways
to the success of the Student Workshop: the members of the Programme Committee for their evaluation
of the submissions and for taking the time to provide useful detailed comments and suggestions for the
improvement of papers; the panelists for providing detailed feedback directly; and the students for their
hard work in preparing their submissions.
We are also very grateful to the EACL for providing sponsorship for students who would otherwise be
unable to attend the workshop and present their work. And finally, thanks to those who have given us
advice and assistance in planning this workshop (especially Nuria Bertomeu, Alex Lascarides, Joakim
Nivre, Konstantinos Stamatakis).
We hope you enjoy the Student Research Workshop.
