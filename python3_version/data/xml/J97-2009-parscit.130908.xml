Whereas artificial forms of communica-

that ambiguity is reduced to a minimum,
natural language is ambiguous at various

volume focuses on semantic ambiguities,
or mostly just ambiguities, when there is
no likelihood of confusion.

Linguistics and Philosophy is a journal for studies focused
on natural language, and is of interest to practitioners in
the disciplines covered in the title. Although the field thus =
described is so extensive that a complete listing of •—p.
N—p.
relevant topics is precluded, at least the following &apos;V
specifically fall within it: . •
- traditional areas in the philosophy of language such as ........
meaning, truth, reference, description, entailment, *
speech acts 1*
- traditional areas of linguistics such as syntax, semantics *
and pragmatics (when the studies are of sufficient .
explicitness and generality to be also of philosophical *
interest) Ann.
ei)
- aspects of artificial intelligence concerned with language 13
such as computational linguistics and natural language •
processing - systems of logic with strong connections =
to natural language: modal logic, tense logic, epistemic
logic, intensional logic
- philosophical questions raised by linguistics as a
science: linguistics methodology, the status of
linguistics theories, the nature of linguistic universals
- philosophically interesting problems at the intersection
of linguistics and other disciplines: language
acquisition, language and perception, language as a Kluwer
social convention. academic

The task of language engineering is to develop the technology for building
computer systems which can perform useful linguistic tasks such as machine
assisted translation, text retrieval, message classification and document sum-
marisation. Such systems often require the use of a parser which can extract
specific types of grammatical data from pre-defined classes of input text.
There are many parsers already available for use in language engineering
systems. However, many different linguistic formalisms and parsing algorithms
are employed. Grammatical coverage varies, as does the nature of the syntactic
information extracted. Direct comparison between systems is difficult because
each is likely to have been evaluated using different test criteria.
In this volume, eight different parsers are applied to the same task, that of
analysing a set of sentences derived from software instruction manuals. Each
parser is presented in a separate chapter. Evaluation of performance is carried
out using a standard set of criteria with the results being presented in a set of
tables which have the same format for each system. Three additional chapters
provide further analysis of the results as well as discussing possible approaches
to the standardisation of parse tree data. Five parse trees are provided for each
system in an appendix, allowing further direct comparison between systems by
the reader.
The book will be of interest to students, researchers and practitioners in the
areas of computational linguistics, computer science, information retrieval,
language engineering, linguistics and machine assisted translation.

&amp;quot;Adaptive Behavior&apos;s uni61ng theme
is the study of issues in the analysis or
design of autonomous agents: that is,
agents [such as animals; creaturelike,
mobile robots (animate); or, software
agents in virtual realities] capable of
coordinating perception and action for
extended periods of time in unknown
and potentially hostile environments.
Such coordinated activity is referred to
as adaptive behavior if it increases the
likelihood of survival.. . .This journal
offers a unique forum for the exchange
of ideas and the study of adaptive
behavior in general ... [and is] the
authoritative publication in the field... .
[The journal&apos;s] editors ... account for
most of the influential researchers in
this young field.... [F]or scientists with
interests in the common ground where
studies of natural and synthetic
autonomous agents meet it should
become essential reading.&amp;quot;
Nature
&amp;quot;The new multidisciplinary journal
Adaptive Behavior ... publishes
research from robotics, artificial
intelligence, cognitive science,
psychology, behavioral ecology
and ethology .. . on the principles
underlying adaptive behavior in
living or artificial beings. Research
especially focuses on the bottom-up
approach to understanding
behaviour.. . Nearly all papers
contain testable models [predomi-
nantly neural networks, parallel
distributed processing and genetic
algorithms] that address real and
interesting behavioural problems . . .
The papers are of a high standard.&amp;quot;

mission of the Journal of Intelligent Information Systems: Integrating
Intelligence and Database Technologies is to present research
development focused on the integration of Artificial Intelligence and
Management technologies to provide models, architectures,
and techniques for the next generation of systems -- Intelligent
Systems. The Journal of Intelligent Information Systems is a
journal that focuses on the creation of information systems that
intelligent behavior and embody intelligence in their reasoning and
processes. Increasingly, knowledge-directed inference
are being used to produce information from the data contained
large shared databases. The goal of the Journal of Intelligent Information
is to provide a forum for those interested in making information
intelligent in which they can publish their original research and
results. For us, intelligence may be manifested in a user
which has knowledge of user profiles and preferences and can
this knowledge to foster more productive human-computer
intelligence may be embodied in the loosely or tightly-coupled
for integrating knowledge-based systems with database
and intelligence may reside in query optimization algorithms
incorporate semantic integrity constraints, heuristics as well as
statistics. Journal of Intelligent Information Systems is an
peer-reviewed, technical journal publishing the following types
high-quality, state-of-the-art papers: - research papers - invited papers
workshop and conference reports - survey and tutorial articles - book
In addition to papers Journal of Intelligent Information Systems
presents: - meeting announcements - reviews - open problems and

Guidelines for Submissions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9844278">
Manuscxripts for Computational Linguistics should be submitted on letter-size paper (8.5 by
11 inches, or A4), double-spaced and single-sided throughout, including footnotes and refer-
ences. The paper should begin with an informative abstract of approximately 150-250 words.
Manuscripts must be written in English. Contact the editor regarding the possibility of electronic
submission.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.925406">
Submissions may be made in any of the following categories:
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9963910625">
Papers: This category includes contributions that report significant new research results in com-
putational linguistics or that provide critical reviews of the literature on a particular topic. The
length of a paper depends on its content, but it is suggested that manuscripts be limited to forty
double-spaced pages. That is the equivalent of thirty journal pages. Each paper is fully refereed,
being read by at least two members of the editorial board and usually by an additional expert
in the particular subject area. The submission of an article to CL for refereeing means that the
author certifies the manuscript is not copyrighted; nor has it been published or submitted for
publication to another refereed journal. If any version of the paper has appeared, or will appear,
in a non-refereed publication, the details of such publication must be made known to the Edi-
tor at the time of submission. The final version of a paper tentatively accepted for publication
must be accompanied by a Copyright Transfer Agreement signed by all of the authors or, in the
case of a &amp;quot;work for hire,&amp;quot; by the employer. This written transfer is necessary under the 1978
U.S. Copyright law.
Letters to the Editor: This category includes statements of opinion on issues relevant to the
readership. The Editor and the editorial board will evaluate the appropriateness of these con-
tributions for inclusion.

Founded in 1962, the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) is the primary scientific and
professional society for natural language processing research and applications. A European chapter was
established in 1982. Besides publishing Computational Linguistics, the ACL holds international meetings
(annually in North America, biennially in Europe) where the state-of-the-art in natural language
processing research and development is presented. Recently, special interest groups on the Mathematics of
Language, the Lexicon, Parsing, Generation, Computational Phonology, and Multimedia Language
Processing have been formed; others are likely to be added.

<abstract confidence="0.987951652173913">Hf!. 45,-/US-$ 28.- The task of language engineering is to develop the technology for building computer systems which can perform useful linguistic tasks such as machine assisted translation, text retrieval, message classification and document summarisation. Such systems often require the use of a parser which can extract specific types of grammatical data from pre-defined classes of input text. There are many parsers already available for use in language engineering systems. However, many different linguistic formalisms and parsing algorithms are employed. Grammatical coverage varies, as does the nature of the syntactic information extracted. Direct comparison between systems is difficult because each is likely to have been evaluated using different test criteria. In this volume, eight different parsers are applied to the same task, that of analysing a set of sentences derived from software instruction manuals. Each parser is presented in a separate chapter. Evaluation of performance is carried out using a standard set of criteria with the results being presented in a set of tables which have the same format for each system. Three additional chapters provide further analysis of the results as well as discussing possible approaches to the standardisation of parse tree data. Five parse trees are provided for each system in an appendix, allowing further direct comparison between systems by the reader. The book will be of interest to students, researchers and practitioners in the areas of computational linguistics, computer science, information retrieval, language engineering, linguistics and machine assisted translation.</abstract>

Contact the editor regarding the possibility of electronic submission. Submissions may be made in any of the following categories: category includes contributions that report significant new research results in computational linguistics or that provide critical reviews of the literature on a particular topic. The length of a paper depends on its content, but it is suggested that manuscripts be limited to forty double-spaced pages. That is the equivalent of thirty journal pages. Each paper is fully refereed, being read by at least two members of the editorial board and usually by an additional expert in the particular subject area. The submission of an article to CL for refereeing means that the author certifies the manuscript is not copyrighted; nor has it been published or submitted for publication to another refereed journal. If any version of the paper has appeared, or will appear, in a non-refereed publication, the details of such publication must be made known to the Editor at the time of submission. The final version of a paper tentatively accepted for publication must be accompanied by a Copyright Transfer Agreement signed by all of the authors or, in the case of a &amp;quot;work for hire,&amp;quot; by the employer. This written transfer is necessary under the 1978 U.S. Copyright law. to the Editor: category includes statements of opinion on issues relevant to the readership. The Editor and the editorial board will evaluate the appropriateness of these contributions for inclusion.</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.728427857142857">Founded in 1962, the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) is the primary scientific and professional society for natural language processing research and applications. A European chapter was in 1982. Besides publishing Linguistics, ACL holds international meetings (annually in North America, biennially in Europe) where the state-of-the-art in natural language processing research and development is presented. Recently, special interest groups on the Mathematics of Language, the Lexicon, Parsing, Generation, Computational Phonology, and Multimedia Language Processing have been formed; others are likely to be added.</abstract>
