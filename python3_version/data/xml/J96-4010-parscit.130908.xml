Gorrell presents a psycholinguistic model of
human parsing in which specific properties
of syntactic knowledge play a crucial role in
determining ambiguity-resolution behavior.
The proposal builds on work in determinis-
tic parsing, relating it to grammar-based ac-
counts of human syntactic preferences and
garden-path behavior. Other grammar-based
approaches have attempted to derive per-
formance data from the content of particu-
lar syntactic constraints and how well they
are satisfied on-line. Gorrell instead proposes
that the significant factor for human process-
ing is the distinction between different types
of structural information that are brought to
bear in syntactic analysis. The classification
of information types determines a natural
modularization of the human parser, which
is argued to account for the behavioral prop-
erties observed. The approach has potential
interest for computational linguists who are
interested in the grammatical underpinnings
of natural language understanding systems,
and in the problem of deriving the best parse
for an ambiguous utterance. In particular,
issues of information encapsulation and its
consequences for incremental interpretation
are of great importance for cognitive mod-
els of language as well as practical NLU sys-
tems. Unfortunately, computational linguists
are likely to be less than satisfied by the lack
of precision in Gorrell&apos;s specification of his
model, and by the absence of a firm compu-
tational foundation for his claims.
The focus of Gorrell&apos;s proposal is the di-
vision of structural information into primary
and secondary relations. The primary rela-
tions are the primitives that are necessary
to a specification of the parse-tree structure
(i.e., dominance and precedence). The sec-
ondary relations are grammatical concepts
that are defined in terms of the resulting
tree (e.g., c-command and government). The
distinction is reflected in the processing of
the two types of information: Primary re-
lations are asserted by a structure-building
module, and secondary relations are evalu-
ated within the resulting tree by a separate
structure interpreter. Given the distinction
between building a structure and verifying
relations within that structure, Gorrell argues
for a new kind of determinism in parsing,
called structural determinism, which applies
only to the structure-building module. The
constraints on the operation of the structure
builder underlie Gorrell&apos;s account of human
disambiguation.
The book is thorough in its review of
Government–Binding theory (the grammat-
ical framework assumed by Gorrell) and of
GB-based models of human parsing. Other
aspects of the book are less complete, leav-
ing a number of questions unanswered. For
example, given that assertions of primitive
relations cannot be retracted in normal pars-
ing, the mechanism for determining which
assertions to make is of critical importance.
Gorrell proposes that the structure-building
module is driven to &amp;quot;[attempt] incrementally
to satisfy principles of grammar.&amp;quot; As stated,
this entails that the structure builder needs
to judge the satisfiability of syntactic con-
straints in order to make assertions about
the parse-tree structure. However, evaluat-
ing the structural conditions under which
those constraints are satisfied is the purview
of the structural interpreter, for which it in
turns needs the assertions about the basic
tree structure. The strict modularization of
the proposed model is the foundation of Gor-
rell&apos;s proposal, but it is not clear how the
division can be maintained, given that the
operation of each module depends on infor-
mation provided by the other.
The book focuses on a topic in psycholin-
guistics that should be of great importance in
building parsers that can mimic human be-
havior and respond to human expectations.
However, the relevance of the particular pro-
posal for computational linguists is less es-
tablished, given the loose development of the
specific components of the model. Computa-
tional linguists who model human sentence-
processing behavior will find an interesting
discussion of some familiar issues in the field
(such as form- versus content-based prefer-
ence strategies, and modularity). The impact
of the central proposal awaits a more thor-
ough and precise development of the de-
tails of the model.—Suzanne Stevenson, Rut-

&amp;quot;The papers in this volume were presented at
a workshop held in June 1991 at the Univer-
sity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, in cele-
bration of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the
Department of Linguistics. The broad theme
of the workshop was Computational Linguis-
tics and the Foundations of Linguistic Theory, and
its purpose was to provide a forum in which
computational linguists, syntacticians, mor-
phologists, and phonologists could come to-
gether and discuss important issues of com-
mon interest.
The areas of linguistic research represented
in this volume are diverse, yet they are
united under the notion that the princi-
ples of grammatical well-formedness and
the principles of language processing are
interdependent.... The fact that many of
the papers included here span several ar-
eas within linguistic theory underscores the
importance of communication between re-
searchers in diverse areas.&amp;quot;—From the preface
