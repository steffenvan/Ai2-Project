Minimum-error-rate training (MERT) is a bot-
tleneck for current development in statistical
machine translation because it is limited in
the number of weights it can reliably opti-
mize. Building on the work of Watanabe et
al., we explore the use of the MIRA algorithm
of Crammer et al. as an alternative to MERT.
We first show that by parallel processing and
exploiting more of the parse forest, we can
obtain results using MIRA that match or sur-
pass MERT in terms of both translation qual-
ity and computational cost. We then test the
method on two classes of features that address
deficiencies in the Hiero hierarchical phrase-
based model: first, we simultaneously train a
large number of Marton and Resnik’s soft syn-
tactic constraints, and, second, we introduce
a novel structural distortion model. In both
cases we obtain significant improvements in
translation performance. Optimizing them in
combination, for a total of 56 feature weights,
we improve performance by 2.6 BLEU on a
subset of the NIST 2006 Arabic-English eval-
uation data.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999927355555556">
Since its introduction by Och (2003), minimum er-
ror rate training (MERT) has been widely adopted
for training statistical machine translation (MT) sys-
tems. However, MERT is limited in the number of
feature weights that it can optimize reliably, with
folk estimates of the limit ranging from 15 to 30 fea-
tures.
One recent example of this limitation is a series
of experiments by Marton and Resnik (2008), in
which they added syntactic features to Hiero (Chi-
ang, 2005; Chiang, 2007), which ordinarily uses no
linguistically motivated syntactic information. Each
of their new features rewards or punishes a deriva-
tion depending on how similar or dissimilar it is
to a syntactic parse of the input sentence. They
found that in order to obtain the greatest improve-
ment, these features had to be specialized for par-
ticular syntactic categories and weighted indepen-
dently. Not being able to optimize them all at once
using MERT, they resorted to running MERT many
times in order to test different combinations of fea-
tures. But it would have been preferable to use a
training method that can optimize the features all at
once.
There has been much work on improving MERT’s
performance (Duh and Kirchoff, 2008; Smith and
Eisner, 2006; Cer et al., 2008), or on replacing
MERT wholesale (Turian et al., 2007; Blunsom et
al., 2008). This paper continues a line of research on
online discriminative training (Tillmann and Zhang,
2006; Liang et al., 2006; Arun and Koehn, 2007),
extending that of Watanabe et al. (2007), who use
the Margin Infused Relaxed Algorithm (MIRA) due
to Crammer et al. (2003; 2006). Our guiding princi-
ple is practicality: like Watanabe et al., we train on
a small tuning set comparable in size to that used
by MERT, but by parallel processing and exploit-
ing more of the parse forest, we obtain results us-
ing MIRA that match or surpass MERT in terms of
both translation quality and computational cost on a
large-scale translation task.
Taking this further, we test MIRA on two classes
of features that make use of syntactic information
and hierarchical structure. First, we generalize Mar-
ton and Resnik’s (2008) soft syntactic constraints by

introduce a novel structural distortion model. We ob-
tain significant improvements in both cases, and fur-
ther large improvements when the two feature sets
are combined.
The paper proceeds as follows. We describe our

of Marton and Resnik’s soft syntactic constraints in
section 3; our novel structural distortion features in
section 4; and experimental results in section 5.

<bodyText confidence="0.999832">
The translation model is a standard linear model
(Och and Ney, 2002), which we train using MIRA
(Crammer and Singer, 2003; Crammer et al., 2006),
following Watanabe et al. (2007). We describe the
basic algorithm first and then progressively refine it.

<bodyText confidence="0.9999975">
Let e, by abuse of notation, stand for both output
strings and their derivations. We represent the fea-
ture vector for derivation e as h(e). Initialize the fea-
ture weights w. Then, repeatedly:

passes through the training data are made, we only
average the weight vectors from the last pass.) The
technique of averaging was introduced in the con-
text of perceptrons as an approximation to taking a
vote among all the models traversed during training,
and has been shown to work well in practice (Fre-
und and Schapire, 1999; Collins, 2002). We follow
McDonald et al. (2005) in applying this technique to
MIRA.
Note that the objective (1) is not the same as that
used by Watanabe et al.; rather, it is the same as
that used by Crammer and Singer (2003) and related
to that of Taskar et al. (2005). We solve this opti-
mization problem using a variant of sequential min-
imal optimization (Platt, 1998): for each i, initialize
αij = C for a single value of j such that eij = e∗i ,
and initialize αij = 0 for all other values of j. Then,
repeatedly choose a sentence i and a pair of hypothe-
ses j, j0, and let

<bodyText confidence="0.9999592">
Assuming BLEU as the evaluation criterion, the loss
`ij of ei j relative to e∗i should be related somehow
to the difference between their BLEU scores. How-
ever, BLEU was not designed to be used on individ-
ual sentences; in general, the highest-BLEU transla-
tion of a sentence depends on what the other sen-
tences in the test set are. Sentence-level approxi-
mations to BLEU exist (Lin and Och, 2004; Liang
et al., 2006), but we found it most effective to per-
form BLEU computations in the context of a set O of
previously-translated sentences, following Watan-
abe et al. (2007). However, we don’t try to accu-
mulate translations for the entire dataset, but simply
maintain an exponentially-weighted moving average
of previous translations.

More precisely: For an input sentence f, let e be
some hypothesis translation and let {rk} be the set of
reference translations for f. Let c(e; {rk}), or simply
c(e) for short, be the vector of the following counts:
|e|, the effective reference length mink |rk|, and, for
1 ≤ n ≤ 4, the number of n-grams in e, and the num-
ber of n-gram matches between e and {rk}. These
counts are sufficient to calculate a BLEU score, which
we write as BLEU(c(e)). The pseudo-document O is
an exponentially-weighted moving average of these
vectors. That is, for each training sentence, let eˆ be
the 1-best translation; after processing the sentence,
we update O, and its input length Of:

<equation confidence="0.999696">
O ← 0.9(O + c(ˆe)) (6)
Of ← 0.9(Of + |f|) (7)

<bodyText confidence="0.999238428571429">
We can then calculate the BLEU score of hypothe-
ses e in the context of O. But the larger O is, the
smaller the impact the current sentence will have on
the BLEU score. To correct for this, and to bring the
loss function roughly into the same range as typical
margins, we scale the BLEU score by the size of the
input:

B(e; f, {rk}) = (Of + |f|) × BLEU(O + c(e; {rk})) (8)

which we also simply write as B(e). Finally, the loss
function is defined to be:

2.3 Oracle translations

<bodyText confidence="0.999991588235294">
We now describe the selection of e∗. We know of
three approaches in previous work. The first is to
force the decoder to output the reference sentence
exactly, and select the derivation with the highest
model score, which Liang et al. (2006) call bold up-
dating. The second uses the decoder to search for
the highest-BLEU translation (Tillmann and Zhang,
2006), which Arun and Koehn (2007) call max-BLEU
updating. Liang et al. and Arun and Koehn experi-
ment with these methods and both opt for a third
method, which Liang et al. call local updating: gen-
erate an n-best list of translations and select the
highest-BLEU translation from it. The intuition is that
due to noise in the training data or reference transla-
tions, a high-BLEU translation may actually use pe-
culiar rules which it would be undesirable to en-
courage the model to use. Hence, in local updating,

<bodyText confidence="0.999981666666667">
the search for the highest-BLEU translation is limited
to the n translations with the highest model score,
where n must be determined experimentally.
Here, we introduce a new oracle-translation selec-
tion method, formulating the intuition behind local
updating as an optimization problem:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9092015">
e∗ = arg max (B(e) + h(e) · w) (10)
e
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999737375">
Instead of choosing the highest-BLEU translation
from an n-best list, we choose the translation that
maximizes a combination of (approximate) BLEU
and the model.
We can also interpret (10) in the following way:
we want e∗ to be the max-BLEU translation, but we
also want to minimize (1). So we balance these two
criteria against each other:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.8753">
e∗ = arg max (B(e) − µ(B(e) − h(e) · w)) (11)
e
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.968617">
where (B(e) − h(e) · w) is that part of (1) that de-
pends on e∗, and µ is a parameter that controls how
much we are willing to allow some translations to
have higher BLEU than e∗ if we can better minimize
(1). Setting µ = 0 would reduce to max-BLEU up-
dating; setting µ = ∞ would never update w at all.
Setting µ = 0.5 reduces to equation (10).
Figure 1 shows the 10-best unique translations for
a single input sentence according to equation (11)
under various settings of µ. The points at far right are
the translations that are scored highest according to

the model. The p = 0 points in the upper-left corner
are typical of oracle translations that would be se-
lected under the max-BLEU policy: they indeed have
a very high BLEU score, but are far removed from the
translations preferred by the model; thus they would
cause violent updates to w. Local updating would
select the topmost point labeled p = 1. Our scheme
would select one of the p = 0.5 points, which have
BLEU scores almost as high as the max-BLEU transla-
tions, yet are not very far from the translations pre-
ferred by the model.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999157">
2.4 Selecting hypothesis translations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999985125">
What is the set {eij} of translation hypotheses? Ide-
ally we would let it be the set of all possible transla-
tions, and let the objective function (1) take all of
them into account. This is the approach taken by
Taskar et al. (2004), but their approach assumes that
the loss function can be decomposed into local loss
functions. Since our loss function cannot be so de-
composed, we select:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.998852142857143">
• the 10-best translations according to the model;
we then rescore the forest to obtain
• the 10-best translations according to equation
(11) with p = 0.5, the first of which is the oracle
translation, and
• the 10-best translations with p = oo, to serve as
negative examples.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999773296296296">
The last case is what Crammer et al. (2006) call
max-loss updating (where “loss” refers to the gener-
alized hinge loss) and Taskar et al. (2005) call loss-
augmented inference. The rationale here is that since
the objective (1) tries to minimize maxj(l&apos;ij − Ahij ·
w&apos;), we should include the translations that have the
highest (l&apos;ij − Ahij · w) in order to approximate the
effect of using the whole forest.
See Figure 1 again for an illustration of the hy-
potheses selected for a single sentence. The max-
BLEU points in the upper left are not included (and
would have no effect even if they were included).
The p = oo points in the lower-right are the negative
examples: they are poor translations that are scored
too high by the model, and the learning algorithm
attempts to shift them to the left.
To perform the forest rescoring, we need to use
several approximations, since an exact search for
BLEU-optimal translations is NP-hard (Leusch et al.,
2008). For every derivation e in the forest, we calcu-
late a vector c(e) of counts as in Section 2.2 except
using unclipped counts of n-gram matches (Dreyer
et al., 2007), that is, the number of matches for an n-
gram can be greater than the number of occurrences
of the n-gram in any reference translation. This can
be done efficiently by calculating c for every hyper-
edge (rule application) in the forest:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999411222222222">
• the number of output words generated by the
rule
• the effective reference length scaled by the frac-
tion of the input sentence consumed by the rule
• the number of n-grams formed by the applica-
tion of the rule (1 &lt; n &lt; 4)
• the (unclipped) number of n-gram matches
formed by the application of the rule (1 &lt; n &lt;
4)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999780928571429">
We keep track of n-grams using the same scheme
used to incorporate an n-gram language model into
the decoder (Wu, 1996; Chiang, 2007).
To find the best derivation in the forest, we tra-
verse it bottom-up as usual, and for every set of al-
ternative subtranslations, we select the one with the
highest score. But here a rough approximation lurks,
because we need to calculate B on the nodes of the
forest, but B does not have the optimal substructure
property, i.e., the optimal score of a parent node can-
not necessarily be calculated from the optimal scores
of its children. Nevertheless, we find that this rescor-
ing method is good enough for generating high-BLEU
oracle translations and low-BLEU negative examples.

2.5 Parallelization
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999955444444444">
One convenient property of MERT is that it is em-
barrassingly parallel: we decode the entire tuning set
sending different sentences to different processors,
and during optimization of feature weights, differ-
ent random restarts can be sent to different proces-
sors. In order to make MIRA comparable in effi-
ciency to MERT, we must parallelize it. But with
an online learning algorithm, parallelization requires
a little more coordination. We run MIRA on each

processor simultaneously, with each maintaining its
own weight vector. A master process distributes dif-
ferent sentences from the tuning set to each of the
processors; when each processor finishes decoding
a sentence, it transmits the resulting hypotheses,
with their losses, to all the other processors and re-
ceives any hypotheses waiting from other proces-
sors. Those hypotheses were generated from differ-
ent weight vectors, but can still provide useful in-
formation. The sets of hypotheses thus collected are
then processed as one batch. When the whole train-
ing process is finished, we simply average all the
weight vectors from all the processors.
Having described our training algorithm, which
includes several practical improvements to Watan-
abe et al.’s usage of MIRA, we proceed in the re-
mainder of the paper to demonstrate the utility of the
our training algorithm on models with large numbers
of structurally sensitive features.

3 Soft syntactic constraints
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999947555555555">
The first features we explore are based on a line
of research introduced by Chiang (2005) and im-
proved on by Marton and Resnik (2008). A hi-
erarchical phrase-based translation model is based
on synchronous context-free grammar, but does not
normally use any syntactic information derived from
linguistic knowledge or treebank data: it uses trans-
lation rules that span any string of words in the input
sentence, without regard for parser-defined syntac-
tic constituency boundaries. Chiang (2005) exper-
imented with a constituency feature that rewarded
rules whose source language side exactly spans a
syntactic constituent according to the output of an
external source-language parser. This feature can
be viewed as a soft syntactic constraint: it biases
the model toward translations that respect syntactic
structure, but does not force it to use them. However,
this more syntactically aware model, when tested in
Chinese-English translation, did not improve trans-
lation performance.
Recently, Marton and Resnik (2008) revisited
the idea of constituency features, and succeeded in
showing that finer-grained soft syntactic constraints
yield substantial improvements in BLEU score for
both Chinese-English and Arabic-English transla-
tion. In addition to adding separate features for dif-
ferent syntactic nonterminals, they introduced a new
type of constraint that penalizes rules when the
source language side crosses the boundaries of a
source syntactic constituent, as opposed to simply
rewarding rules when they are consistent with the
source-language parse tree.
Marton and Resnik optimized their features’
weights using MERT. But since MERT does not
scale well to large numbers of feature weights, they
were forced to test individual features and manu-
ally selected feature combinations each in a sepa-
rate model. Although they showed gains in trans-
lation performance for several such models, many
larger, potentially better feature combinations re-
mained unexplored. Moreover, the best-performing
feature subset was different for the two language
pairs, suggesting that this labor-intensive feature se-
lection process would have to be repeated for each
new language pair.
Here, we use MIRA to optimize Marton and
Resnik’s finer-grained single-category features all at
once. We define below two sets of features, a coarse-
grained class that combines several constituency cat-
egories, and a fine-grained class that puts different
categories into different features. Both kinds of fea-
tures were used by Marton and Resnik, but only a
few at a time. Crucially, our training algorithm pro-
vides the ability to train all the fine-grained features,
a total of 34 feature weights, simultaneously.
Coarse-grained features As the basis for coarse-
grained syntactic features, we selected the following
nonterminal labels based on their frequency in the
tuning data, whether they frequently cover a span
of more than one word, and whether they repre-
sent linguistically relevant constituents: NP, PP, S,
VP, SBAR, ADJP, ADVP, and QP. We define two
new features, one which fires when a rule’s source
side span in the input sentence matches any of the
above-mentioned labels in the input parse, and an-
other which fires when a rule’s source side span
crosses a boundary of one of these labels (e.g., its
source side span only partially covers the words in
a VP subtree, and it also covers some or all or the
words outside the VP subtree). These two features
are equivalent to Marton and Resnik’s XP= and XP&apos;
feature combinations, respectively.

Fine-grained features We selected the following
nonterminal labels that appear more than 100 times
in the tuning data: NP, PP, S, VP, SBAR, ADJP,
WHNP, PRT, ADVP, PRN, and QP. The labels that
were excluded were parts of speech, nonconstituent
labels like FRAG, or labels that occurred only two
or three times. For each of these labels X, we added
a separate feature that fires when a rule’s source side
span in the input sentence matches X, and a second
feature that fires when a span crosses a boundary of
X. These features are similar to Marton and Resnik’s
X= and X+, except that our set includes features for
WHNP, PRT, and PRN.

4 Structural distortion features
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999602769230769">
In addition to parser-based syntactic constraints,
which were introduced in prior work, we introduce
a completely new set of features aimed at improv-
ing the modeling of reordering within Hiero. Again,
the feature definition gives rise to a larger number of
features than one would expect to train successfully
using MERT.
In a phrase-based model, reordering is per-
formed both within phrase pairs and by the phrase-
reordering model. Both mechanisms are able to
learn that longer-distance reorderings are more
costly than shorter-distance reorderings: phrase
pairs, because phrases that involve more extreme re-
orderings will (presumably) have a lower count in
the data, and phrase reordering, because models are
usually explicitly dependent on distance.
By contrast, in a hierarchical model, all reordering
is performed by a single mechanism, the rules of the
grammar. In some cases, the model will be able to
learn a preference for shorter-distance reorderings,
as in a phrase-based system, but in the case of a word
being reordered across a nonterminal, or two non-
terminals being reordered, there is no dependence in
the model on the size of the nonterminal or nonter-
minals involved in reordering.
So, for example, if we have rules
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.962564">

X (il dit X1, X1 he said) (13)

we might expect that rule (12) is more common in
general, but that rule (13) becomes more and more

rare as X1 gets larger. The default Hiero features
have no way to learn this.
To address this defect, we can classify every
nonterminal pair occurring on the right-hand side
of each grammar rule as “reordered” or “not re-
ordered”, that is, whether it intersects any other word
alignment link or nonterminal pair (see Figure 2).
We then define coarse- and fine-grained versions of
the structural distortion model.
Coarse-grained features Let R be a binary-
valued random variable that indicates whether a non-
terminal occurrence is reordered, and let S be an
integer-valued random variable that indicates how
many source words are spanned by the nonterminal
occurrence. We can estimate P(R  |S) via relative-
frequency estimation from the rules as they are ex-
tracted from the parallel text, and incorporate this
probability as a new feature of the model.
Fine-grained features A difficulty with the
coarse-grained reordering features is that the gram-
mar extraction process finds overlapping rules in the
training data and might not give a sensible proba-
bility estimate; moreover, reordering statistics from
the training data might not carry over perfectly into
the translation task (in particular, the training data
may have some very freely-reordering translations
that one might want to avoid replicating in transla-
tion). As an alternative, we introduce a fine-grained
version of our distortion model that can be trained
directly in the translation task as follows: define
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.9996867">
a separate binary feature for each value of (R, S),
where R is as above and S E J*, 1, ... , 9, &gt;_101 and *
means any size. For example, if a nonterminal with
span 11 has its contents reordered, then the features
(true, &gt;_10) and (true, *) would both fire. Grouping
all sizes of 10 or more into a single feature is de-
signed to avoid overfitting.
Again, using MIRA makes it practical to train
with the full fine-grained feature set—coincidentally
also a total of 34 features.

We now describe our experiments to test MIRA and
our features, the soft-syntactic constraints and the
structural distortion features, on an Arabic-English
translation task. It is worth noting that this exper-
imentation is on a larger scale than Watanabe et
al.’s (2007), and considerably larger than Marton
and Resnik’s (2008).

The baseline model was Hiero with the following
baseline features (Chiang, 2005; Chiang, 2007):

– two classes of number/name translation
rules
– glue rules
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999904358974359">
The probability features are base-100 log-
probabilities.
The rules were extracted from all the allow-
able parallel text from the NIST 2008 evalua-
tion (152+175 million words of Arabic+English),
aligned by IBM Model 4 using GIZA++ (union of
both directions). Hierarchical rules were extracted
from the most in-domain corpora (4.2+5.4 million
words) and phrases were extracted from the remain-
der. We trained the coarse-grained distortion model
on 10,000 sentences of the training data.
Two language models were trained, one on data
similar to the English side of the parallel text and
one on 2 billion words of English. Both were 5-
gram models with modified Kneser-Ney smoothing,
lossily compressed using a perfect-hashing scheme
similar to that of Talbot and Brants (2008) but using
minimal perfect hashing (Botelho et al., 2005).
We partitioned the documents of the NIST 2004
(newswire) and 2005 Arabic-English evaluation data
into a tuning set (1178 sentences) and a develop-
ment set (1298 sentences). The test data was the
NIST 2006 Arabic-English evaluation data (NIST
part, newswire and newsgroups, 1529 sentences).
To obtain syntactic parses for this data, we tok-
enized it according to the Arabic Treebank standard
using AMIRA (Diab et al., 2004), parsed it with
the Stanford parser (Klein and Manning, 2003), and
then forced the trees back into the MT system’s tok-
enization.1
We ran both MERT and MIRA on the tuning
set using 20 parallel processors. We stopped MERT
when the score on the tuning set stopped increas-
ing, as is common practice, and for MIRA, we used
the development set to decide when to stop train-
ing.2 In our runs, MERT took an average of 9 passes
through the tuning set and MIRA took an average of
8 passes. (For comparison, Watanabe et al. report de-
coding their tuning data of 663 sentences 80 times.)

Table 1 shows the results of our experiments with
the training methods and features described above.
All significance testing was performed against the

sampling (Koehn, 2004).

MERT when both use the baseline feature set. In-

1The only notable consequence this had for our experimen-

were coextensive.
2We chose this policy for MIRA to avoid overfitting. How-
ever, we could have used the tuning set for this purpose, just as
with MERT: in none of our runs would this change have made
more than a 0.2 Bleu difference on the development set.

deed, the MIRA system scores significantly higher
on the test set; but if we break the test set down by
genre, we see that the MIRA system does slightly
worse on newswire and better on newsgroups. (This
is largely attributable to the fact that the MIRA trans-
lations tend to be longer than the MERT transla-
tions, and the newsgroup references are also rela-
tively longer than the newswire references.)
When we add more features to the model, the two
training methods diverge more sharply. When train-
ing with MERT, the coarse-grained pair of syntax
features yields a small improvement, but the fine-
grained syntax features do not yield any further im-
provement. By contrast, when the fine-grained fea-
tures are trained using MIRA, they yield substan-
tial improvements. We observe similar behavior for
the structural distortion features: MERT is not able
to take advantage of the finer-grained features, but
MIRA is. Finally, using MIRA to combine both
classes of features, 56 in all, produces the largest im-
provement, 2.6 BLEU points over the MERT baseline
on the full test set.
We also tested some of the differences between
our training method and Watanabe et al.’s (2007); the
results are shown in Table 2. Compared with local
updating (line 2), our method of selecting the ora-
cle translation and negative examples does better by
0.5 BLEU points on the development data. Using loss-
augmented inference to add negative examples to lo-
cal updating (line 3) does not appear to help. Never-
theless, the negative examples are important: for if

we use our method for selecting the oracle transla-

tions and unable to find a weight setting to shorten
them. It appears, then, that the additional negative
examples enable the algorithm to reliably learn from
the enhanced oracle translations.
Finally, we compared our parallelization method
against a simpler method in which all processors
learn independently and their weight vectors are all
averaged together (line 5). We see that sharing in-
formation among the processors makes a significant
difference.

and Resnik (2008). Watanabe et al.’s work showed
that large-margin training with MIRA can be made
feasible for state-of-the-art MT systems by using a
manageable tuning set; we have demonstrated that
parallel processing and exploiting more of the parse
forest improves MIRA’s performance and that, even
using the same set of features, MIRA’s performance
compares favorably to MERT in terms of both trans-
lation quality and computational cost.
Marton and Resnik (2008) showed that it is pos-
sible to improve translation in a data-driven frame-
work by incorporating source-side syntactic analy-
sis in the form of soft syntactic constraints. This
work joins a growing body of work demonstrating
the utility of syntactic information in statistical MT.
In the area of source-side syntax, recent research
has continued to improve tree-to-string translation
models, soften the constraints of the input tree in
various ways (Mi et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2008),
and extend phrase-based translation with source-
side soft syntactic constraints (Cherry, 2008). All
this work shows strong promise, but Marton and
Resnik’s soft syntactic constraint approach is par-
ticularly appealing because it can be used unobtru-
sively with any hierarchically-structured translation
model. Here, we have shown that using MIRA to
weight all the constraints at once removes the cru-
cial drawback of the approach, the problem of fea-
ture selection.
Finally, we have introduced novel structural dis-
tortion features to fill a notable gap in the hierar-
chical phrase-based approach. By capturing how re-
ordering depends on constituent length, these fea-
tures improve translation quality significantly. In
sum, we have shown that removing the bottleneck
of MERT opens the door to many possibilities for
better translation.

<abstract confidence="0.998046">Minimum-error-rate training (MERT) is a bottleneck for current development in statistical machine translation because it is limited in the number of weights it can reliably optimize. Building on the work of Watanabe et al., we explore the use of the MIRA algorithm of Crammer et al. as an alternative to MERT. We first show that by parallel processing and exploiting more of the parse forest, we can obtain results using MIRA that match or surpass MERT in terms of both translation quality and computational cost. We then test the method on two classes of features that address deficiencies in the Hiero hierarchical phrasebased model: first, we simultaneously train a large number of Marton and Resnik’s soft syntactic constraints, and, second, we introduce a novel structural distortion model. In both cases we obtain significant improvements in translation performance. Optimizing them in combination, for a total of 56 feature weights, improve performance by 2.6 a subset of the NIST 2006 Arabic-English evaluation data.</abstract>

Marton and Resnik (2008) showed that it is possible to improve translation in a data-driven framework by incorporating source-side syntactic analysis in the form of soft syntactic constraints. This work joins a growing body of work demonstrating the utility of syntactic information in statistical MT. In the area of source-side syntax, recent research has continued to improve tree-to-string translation models, soften the constraints of the input tree in various ways (Mi et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2008), and extend phrase-based translation with sourceside soft syntactic constraints (Cherry, 2008). All this work shows strong promise, but Marton and Resnik’s soft syntactic constraint approach is particularly appealing because it can be used unobtrusively with any hierarchically-structured translation model. Here, we have shown that using MIRA to weight all the constraints at once removes the crucial drawback of the approach, the problem of feature selection. Finally, we have introduced novel structural distortion features to fill a notable gap in the hierarchical phrase-based approach. By capturing how reordering depends on constituent length, these features improve translation quality </context>

However, MERT is limited in the number of feature weights that it can optimize reliably, with folk estimates of the limit ranging from 15 to 30 features. One recent example of this limitation is a series of experiments by Marton and Resnik (2008), in which they added syntactic features to Hiero (Chiang, 2005; Chiang, 2007), which ordinarily uses no linguistically motivated syntactic information. Each of their new features rewards or punishes a derivation depending on how similar or dissimilar it is to a syntactic parse of the input sentence.

When the whole training process is finished, we simply average all the weight vectors from all the processors. Having described our training algorithm, which includes several practical improvements to Watanabe et al.’s usage of MIRA, we proceed in the remainder of the paper to demonstrate the utility of the our training algorithm on models with large numbers of structurally sensitive features. 3 Soft syntactic constraints The first features we explore are based on a line of research introduced by Chiang (2005) and improved on by Marton and Resnik (2008). A hierarchical phrase-based translation model is based on synchronous context-free grammar, but does not normally use any syntactic information derived from linguistic knowledge or treebank data: it uses translation rules that span any string of words in the input sentence, without regard for parser-defined syntactic constituency boundaries. Chiang (2005) experimented with a constituency feature that rewarded rules whose source language side exactly spans a syntactic constituent according to the output of an external source-language parser. This fe</context>

Again, using MIRA makes it practical to train with the full fine-grained feature set—coincidentally also a total of 34 features. 5 Experiment and results We now describe our experiments to test MIRA and our features, the soft-syntactic constraints and the structural distortion features, on an Arabic-English translation task. It is worth noting that this experimentation is on a larger scale than Watanabe et al.’s (2007), and considerably larger than Marton and Resnik’s (2008). 5.1 Experimental setup The baseline model was Hiero with the following baseline features (Chiang, 2005; Chiang, 2007): • two language models • phrase translation probabilities p(f |e) and p(e |f) • lexical weighting in both directions (Koehn et al., 2003) • word penalty • penalties for: – automatically extracted rules – identity rules (translating a word into itself) – two classes of number/name translation rules – glue rules The probability features are base-100 logprobabilities. The rules were extracted from all the allowable parallel text from the NIST 2008 evaluation (152+175 million words of Arabic+English), aligned by IBM Model 4 using GIZA++ (union of both directions).

It appears, then, that the additional negative examples enable the algorithm to reliably learn from the enhanced oracle translations. Finally, we compared our parallelization method against a simpler method in which all processors learn independently and their weight vectors are all averaged together (line 5). We see that sharing information among the processors makes a significant difference. 6 Conclusions In this paper, we have brought together two existing lines of work: the training method of Watanabe et al. (2007), and the models of Chiang (2005) and Marton 53.1− 53.0−− failed 231 and Resnik (2008). Watanabe et al.’s work showed that large-margin training with MIRA can be made feasible for state-of-the-art MT systems by using a manageable tuning set; we have demonstrated that parallel processing and exploiting more of the parse forest improves MIRA’s performance and that, even using the same set of features, MIRA’s performance compares favorably to MERT in terms of both translation quality and computational cost.

This can be done efficiently by calculating c for every hyperedge (rule application) in the forest: • the number of output words generated by the rule • the effective reference length scaled by the fraction of the input sentence consumed by the rule • the number of n-grams formed by the application of the rule (1 &lt; n &lt; 4) • the (unclipped) number of n-gram matches formed by the application of the rule (1 &lt; n &lt; 4) We keep track of n-grams using the same scheme used to incorporate an n-gram language model into the decoder (Wu, 1996; Chiang, 2007). To find the best derivation in the forest, we traverse it bottom-up as usual, and for every set of alternative subtranslations, we select the one with the highest score. But here a rough approximation lurks, because we need to calculate B on the nodes of the forest, but B does not have the optimal substructure property, i.e., the optimal score of a parent node cannot necessarily be calculated from the optimal scores of its children. Nevertheless, we find that this rescoring method is good enough for generating high-BLEU oracle translations and low-BLEU negative examples. 2.5 Parallelization </context>

This is the approach taken by Taskar et al. (2004), but their approach assumes that the loss function can be decomposed into local loss functions. Since our loss function cannot be so decomposed, we select: • the 10-best translations according to the model; we then rescore the forest to obtain • the 10-best translations according to equation (11) with p = 0.5, the first of which is the oracle translation, and • the 10-best translations with p = oo, to serve as negative examples.

To perform the forest rescoring, we need to use several approximations, since an exact search for BLEU-optimal translations is NP-hard (Leusch et al., 2008). For every derivation e in the forest, we calculate a vector c(e) of counts as in Section 2.2 except using unclipped counts of n-gram matches (Dreyer et al., 2007), that is, the number of matches for an ngram can be greater than the number of occurrences of the n-gram in any reference translation.

It is worth noting that this experimentation is on a larger scale than Watanabe et al.’s (2007), and considerably larger than Marton and Resnik’s (2008). 5.1 Experimental setup The baseline model was Hiero with the following baseline features (Chiang, 2005; Chiang, 2007): • two language models • phrase translation probabilities p(f |e) and p(e |f) • lexical weighting in both directions (Koehn et al., 2003) • word penalty • penalties for: – automatically extracted rules – identity rules (translating a word into itself) – two classes of number/name translation rules – glue rules The probability features are base-100 logprobabilities. The rules were extracted from all the allowable parallel text from the NIST 2008 evaluation (152+175 million words of Arabic+English), aligned by IBM Model 4 using GIZA++ (union of both directions).

The p = oo points in the lower-right are the negative examples: they are poor translations that are scored too high by the model, and the learning algorithm attempts to shift them to the left. To perform the forest rescoring, we need to use several approximations, since an exact search for BLEU-optimal translations is NP-hard (Leusch et al., 2008). For every derivation e in the forest, we calculate a vector c(e) of counts as in Section 2.2 except using unclipped counts of n-gram matches (Dreyer et al., 2007), that is, the number of matches for an ngram can be greater than the number of occurrences of the n-gram in any reference translation. This can be done efficiently by calculating c for every hyperedge (rule application) in the forest: • the number of output words generated by the rule • the effective reference length scaled by the fraction of the input sentence consumed by the rule • the number of n-grams formed by the application </context>

Optimizing them in combination, for a total of 56 feature weights, we improve performance by 2.6 BLEU on a subset of the NIST 2006 Arabic-English evaluation data. 1 Introduction Since its introduction by Och (2003), minimum error rate training (MERT) has been widely adopted for training statistical machine translation (MT) systems. However, MERT is limited in the number of feature weights that it can optimize reliably, with folk estimates of the limit ranging from 15 to 30 features. One recent example of this limitation is a series of experiments by Marton and Resnik (2008), in which they added syntactic features to Hiero (Chiang, 2005; Chiang, 2007), which ordinarily uses no linguistically motivated syntactic information. Each of their new features rewards or punishes a derivation depending on how similar or dissimilar it is to a syntactic parse of the input sentence. They found that in order to obtain the greatest improvement, these features had to be specialized for particular syntactic categories and weighted independently. Not being able to optimize them all at once using MERT, they resorted to running MERT many times in order to test different combinations</context>

When the whole training process is finished, we simply average all the weight vectors from all the processors. Having described our training algorithm, which includes several practical improvements to Watanabe et al.’s usage of MIRA, we proceed in the remainder of the paper to demonstrate the utility of the our training algorithm on models with large numbers of structurally sensitive features. 3 Soft syntactic constraints The first features we explore are based on a line of research introduced by Chiang (2005) and improved on by Marton and Resnik (2008). A hierarchical phrase-based translation model is based on synchronous context-free grammar, but does not normally use any syntactic information derived from linguistic knowledge or treebank data: it uses translation rules that span any string of words in the input sentence, without regard for parser-defined syntactic constituency boundaries. Chiang (2005) experimented with a constituency feature that rewarded rules whose source language side exactly spans a syntactic constituent according to the output of an external source-language parser. This feature can be viewed as a soft syntactic cons</context>

Watanabe et al.’s work showed that large-margin training with MIRA can be made feasible for state-of-the-art MT systems by using a manageable tuning set; we have demonstrated that parallel processing and exploiting more of the parse forest improves MIRA’s performance and that, even using the same set of features, MIRA’s performance compares favorably to MERT in terms of both translation quality and computational cost.

The technique of averaging was introduced in the context of perceptrons as an approximation to taking a vote among all the models traversed during training, and has been shown to work well in practice (Freund and Schapire, 1999; Collins, 2002). We follow McDonald et al. (2005) in applying this technique to MIRA. Note that the objective (1) is not the same as that used by Watanabe et al.; rather, it is the same as that used by Crammer and Singer (2003) and related to that of Taskar et al. (2005). We solve this optimization problem using a variant of sequential minimal optimization (Platt, 1998): for each i, initialize αij = C for a single value of j such that eij = e∗i , and initialize αij = 0 for all other values of j. Then, repeatedly choose a sentence i and a pair of hypotheses j, j0, and let w0 ← w0 + δ(Ahi j − Ahi j0) (2) αi j ← αij + δ (3) αij0 ← αij0 − δ (4) where • Decode each fi to obtain a set of hypothesis translations ei1, ... , ein. δ = clip [−αij,αij0] (`ij − `ij0) − (Ahi j − Ahi j0) · w0 (5) kAhij − Ahi j0k2 • For each i, select one of the eij to be the oracle translat</context>

(2004), but their approach assumes that the loss function can be decomposed into local loss functions. Since our loss function cannot be so decomposed, we select: • the 10-best translations according to the model; we then rescore the forest to obtain • the 10-best translations according to equation (11) with p = 0.5, the first of which is the oracle translation, and • the 10-best translations with p = oo, to serve as negative examples. The last case is what Crammer et al. (2006) call max-loss updating (where “loss” refers to the generalized hinge loss) and Taskar et al. (2005) call lossaugmented inference. The rationale here is that since the objective (1) tries to minimize maxj(l&apos;ij − Ahij · w&apos;), we should include the translations that have the highest (l&apos;ij − Ahij · w) in order to approximate the effect of using the whole forest. See Figure 1 again for an illustration of the hypotheses selected for a single sentence. The maxBLEU points in the upper left are not included (and would have no effect even if they were included). The p = oo points in the lower-right are the negative examples: they are poor translations that are scored too high by the model, and the lea</context>

The first is to force the decoder to output the reference sentence exactly, and select the derivation with the highest model score, which Liang et al. (2006) call bold updating. The second uses the decoder to search for the highest-BLEU translation (Tillmann and Zhang, 2006), which Arun and Koehn (2007) call max-BLEU updating. Liang et al. and Arun and Koehn experiment with these methods and both opt for a third method, which Liang et al. call local updating: generate an n-best list of translations and select the highest-BLEU translation from it. The intuition is that due to noise in the training data or reference translations, a high-BLEU translation may actually use peculiar rules which it would be undesirable to encourage the model to use.

We obtain significant improvements in both cases, and further large improvements when the two feature sets are combined. The paper proceeds as follows. We describe our training algorithm in section 2; our generalization of Marton and Resnik’s soft syntactic constraints in section 3; our novel structural distortion features in section 4; and experimental results in section 5. 2 Learning algorithm The translation model is a standard linear model (Och and Ney, 2002), which we train using MIRA (Crammer and Singer, 2003; Crammer et al., 2006), following Watanabe et al. (2007). We describe the basic algorithm first and then progressively refine it. 2.1 Basic algorithm Let e, by abuse of notation, stand for both output strings and their derivations. We represent the feature vector for derivation e as h(e). Initialize the feature weights w. Then, repeatedly: • Select a batch of input sentences f1, ... , fm. passes through the training data are made, we only average the weight vectors from the last pass.)

However, BLEU was not designed to be used on individual sentences; in general, the highest-BLEU translation of a sentence depends on what the other sentences in the test set are. Sentence-level approximations to BLEU exist (Lin and Och, 2004; Liang et al., 2006), but we found it most effective to perform BLEU computations in the context of a set O of previously-translated sentences, following Watanabe et al. (2007). However, we don’t try to accumulate translations for the entire dataset, but simply maintain an exponentially-weighted moving average of previous translations. 2kw0 − wk2 + C 1 �m i=1 225 More precisely: For an input sentence f, let e be some hypothesis translation and let {rk} be the set of reference translations for f. Let c(e; {rk}), or simply c(e) for short, be the vector of the following counts: |e|, the effective reference length mink |rk|, and, for 1 ≤ n ≤ 4, the number of n-grams in e, and the number of n-gram matches between e and {rk}. These counts are sufficient to calculate a BLE</context>

It appears, then, that the additional negative examples enable the algorithm to reliably learn from the enhanced oracle translations. Finally, we compared our parallelization method against a simpler method in which all processors learn independently and their weight vectors are all averaged together (line 5). We see that sharing information among the processors makes a significant difference. 6 Conclusions In this paper, we have brought together two existing lines of work: the training method of Watanabe et al.

Watanabe et al.’s work showed that large-margin training with MIRA can be made feasible for state-of-the-art MT systems by using a manageable tuning set; we have demonstrated that parallel processing and exploiting more of the parse forest improves MIRA’s performance and that, even using the same set of features, MIRA’s performance compares favorably to MERT in terms of both translation quality and computational cost.

This can be done efficiently by calculating c for every hyperedge (rule application) in the forest: • the number of output words generated by the rule • the effective reference length scaled by the fraction of the input sentence consumed by the rule • the number of n-grams formed by the application of the rule (1 &lt; n &lt; 4) • the (unclipped) number of n-gram matches formed by the application of the rule (1 &lt; n &lt; 4) We keep track of n-grams using the same scheme used to incorporate an n-gram language model into the decoder (Wu, 1996; Chiang, 2007). To find the best derivation in the forest, we traverse it bottom-up as usual, and for every set of alternative subtranslations, we select the one with the highest score. But here a rough approximation lurks, because we need to calculate B on the nodes of the forest, but B does not have the optimal substructure property, i.e., the optimal score of a parent node cannot necessarily be calculated from the optimal scores of its children. Nevertheless, we find that this rescoring method is good enough for generating high-BLEU oracle translations and low-BLEU negative examples. 2.5 P</context>

Marton and Resnik (2008) showed that it is possible to improve translation in a data-driven framework by incorporating source-side syntactic analysis in the form of soft syntactic constraints. This work joins a growing body of work demonstrating the utility of syntactic information in statistical MT. In the area of source-side syntax, recent research has continued to improve tree-to-string translation models, soften the constraints of the input tree in various ways (Mi et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2008), and extend phrase-based translation with sourceside soft syntactic constraints (Cherry, 2008). All this work shows strong promise, but Marton and Resnik’s soft syntactic constraint approach is particularly appealing because it can be used unobtrusively with any hierarchically-structured translation model. Here, we have shown that using MIRA to weight all the constraints at once removes the crucial drawback of the approach, the problem of feature selection. Finally, we have introduced novel structural distortion features to fill a notable gap in the hierarchical phrase-based approach. By capt</context>
