1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999980142857143">
The centering framework (Grosz et al., 1995) is one
of the most influential computational linguistics the-
ories relating local focus to the form chosen for re-
ferring expressions. A number of studies have de-
veloped refinements and extensions of the theory
(eg. Brennan et al., 1987; Kameyama, 1986; Strube
and Hahn, 1996; Walker et al., 1998), but few have
attempted to extend the model to multi-party dis-
course (cf. Brennan, 1998; Walker, 1998).
For dialog systems, the benefits of using cen-
tering theory include improved reference resolution
and generation of more coherent referring expres-
sions. However, it is not at all clear how to adapt
the theory for multi-party discourse. This paper ex-
amines some of the issues involved in adapting the
theory, then describes the results of applying three
alternative models to a corpus of 2-person dialogs.
We chose very naive approximations to the original
theory as a starting point. These results will be a
baseline for evaluating more sophisticated models
in the future.

focus of Un+i ; 2) when local focus is maintained
between utterances, the model predicts that it will be
expressed with a pronoun; and 3) when a pronoun is
encountered, the model provides a preference order-

At the heart of the theory are two centering rules:
Rule 1: If any member of Cfn is realized by a pro-
noun in Cfn+i, Cbn+i must be a pronoun.
Rule 2: Sequences of continues are preferred over
sequences of retains, and sequences of retains are
preferred over sequences of shifts.

A variety of issues must be addressed to adapt cen-

<listItem confidence="0.992067888888889">
1. Utterance boundaries are difficult to pin down
in spoken dialog, and their determination af-
fects the Cf lists. Just how the speaker turns
are broken into utterances has a huge impact
on the success of the model (Brennan, 1998).
2. Should the dialog participants, referred to via
first- and second-person pronouns (1/2PPs), be
considered &apos;discourse entities&apos; and included in
C f?

Our data is from four randomly chosen dialogs
in the CALLHOME-English corpus3 (LDC, 1997).

dress the issues described in Section 3.

utterance boundaries as transcribed4, even if an
utterance was a fragment properly belonging at
the end of the one preceding. For instance, the
following two utterances seem as though they
should be just one:
Example 1 [dialog 4571]
A ... and she called me one day when
A there was nobody in the house but her...
For compound sentences, we broke each non-
subordinate clause into a new utterance. The utter-
ance break added in Example 2 is indicated by /:
Example 2 [dialog 4248]
A It does make a difference / like I always
thought formula smells kind of disgusting.
Issue 2: Selection of items for Cf Two crucial
factors in the original model are left to the algo-
rithm implementer: the selection of items for Cf
and their rank order. Both are active areas of re-
search. In our models, all elements of Cf are cre-
ated from nouns in the utterance. We do not include
entities referred to by complex nominal constituents
such as infinitives. Associations (eg. part/subpart)
and ellipsed items are not allowed in determining
elements of Cf. We adopted a commonly used
Cf ordering: Subj &gt; DO &gt; 10 &gt; Other. Linear
sentence position is used to order multiple &apos;other&apos;
constituents. Whether discourse participants should
be considered discourse entities is very perplexing
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.9478515">
3The dialog transcripts consisted of 614 utterances, 30 min-
utes of speech. After annotation (see issue 1 in section 4), there
were 664 non-empty utterances.
4CALLH0ME transcribers separated utterances at a
speaker change or a long pause, or if the semantics or syntax of
the language indicated the end of an utterance.

from a centering viewpoint (Byron and Stent, 1998).
One of our models includes entities referred to by
1/2PPs in Cf and two do not.
Issues 3/4: Previous utterance Empty utter-
ances (containing no discourse entities) are skipped
in determining Cfn_i. Empty utterances include
acknowledgements and utterances like &amp;quot;hard to
leave behind&amp;quot; with no explicitly mentioned objects.
The dialogs were annotated for discourse struc-
ture, so Un_1 is the previous utterance in the dis-
course segment, not necessarily linear order.5 In
mode12, the highest ranked element of Cf from ei-
ther the current speaker&apos;s prior utterance or the other
speaker&apos;s previous utterance is Cb6; models 1&amp;3
consider only the immediately preceding utterance.
We also annotated the &apos;real&apos; topic of each utter-
ance, selected according to the annotator&apos;s intuition
of what the utterance is &apos;about&apos;. It must be explic-
itly referred to in the utterance and can be an entity
referred to using a 1/2PP.
After the three models were defined, one dialog
was used to train the annotators (the authors)7, then
the other three were independently annotated ac-
cording to the rules outlined above. The annotators
compared their results and agreed upon a reconciled
version of the data, which was used to produce the
results reported in Section 5. Annotator accuracy as
measured against the reconciled data over all cate-
gories ranged from 80% to 89%. Accuracy was cal-
culated by counting the number of utterances that
differed from the reconciled data (including differ-
ent ordering of Cf), divided by total utterances.8

5 Results and analysis
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.971567">
Table 2 summarizes our findings. Only 10 of 664 ut-
terances violate Centering Rule 1, so centering the-
ory&apos;s assumptions linking local focus to pronouns
appear to hold in dialog. It is interesting to note that
Model 1, which includes dialog participants as dis-
course entities, consistently performed best in the
categories used for this evaluation.9
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.955020384615385">
5The authors performed segmentation together; the purpose
of this study is to examine extensions of centering theory, not
discourse segmentation.
6In case of conflict, recency takes precedence.
7Annotators must not confer during annotation, so a training
dialog is used to clarify unclear annotation instructions. In this
case, the annotators examined it to agree on which syntactic
constituents would contribute Cf elements and the criteria for
breaking turns into utterances.
8More standard reliability measures could not be used since
there are no &amp;quot;tags&amp;quot; in this annotation scheme, and within some
categories there may be an ordered list of items.

5.1 Empty Cb&apos;s
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9982005">
Each of our models leaves at least 52% of non-
empty utterances with no prediction of the Cb
(C f_1 and Cf n are disjoint).10 Some empty
Cb&apos;s result from abrupt topic shifts, while others
occur when the speakers make topically related, but
Cf -disjoint, contributions, such as the last line in:

my life. I feel like I&apos;m never going to figure it out.
B Lizzy, you might not.
B I haven&apos;t figured out mine yet.
In many cases, a Cb would exist if we modified the
models to include associated and ellipsed entities
in Cf. For instance, in Example 4, the ellipsed
location in A&apos;s utterance should be the Cb:
Example 4 [dialog 4248]
B ... I&apos;ve been there wait, yes three times I think
A Well this is our second time

5.2 Cb Matches the &apos;real&apos; topic

<bodyText confidence="0.977361357142857">
For utterances where a Cb can be selected, it
matches the &apos;real&apos; topic only 21% to 35% of
the time. By this measure, our models are poor
predictors of local focus. For instance, in Example
5, the &apos;real&apos; topic of the first utterance is Jackson,
but according to Modell the set of entities referred
to by &amp;quot;we&amp;quot; is the Cb of both utterances.
Example 5 [dialog 4248]
A And like we went into Jackson, the town and /
we were like â€” AAAHHH! let me out of here
The annotators&apos; intuitions regarding the &apos;real&apos;
topic often conflicted. It would be interesting to an-
notate actor and discourse focus separately, then see
which one the Cb most closely matches.

<bodyText confidence="0.9642929">
Strube and Hahn (1996) propose a method of eval-
uating a model against centering rule 2, measuring
the &apos;cost&apos; of the listener&apos;s inference load. A cheap
transition has Cb,â€ž = CPnâ€”i, otherwise it is expen-
sive. Models with a large percent of cheap transi-
1057% of Cb&apos;s in Modell are entities referred to via 1/2PPs.

three of our models produced a very low percent
of cheap transitions in this experiment, especially
when compared to Strube and Hahn&apos;s result of 80%.

A number of studies have developed refinements and extensions of the theory (eg. Brennan et al., 1987; Kameyama, 1986; Strube and Hahn, 1996; Walker et al., 1998), but few have attempted to extend the model to multi-party discourse (cf. Brennan, 1998; Walker, 1998). For dialog systems, the benefits of using centering theory include improved reference resolution and generation of more coherent referring expressions. However, it is not at all clear how to adapt the theory for multi-party discourse. This paper examines some of the issues involved in adapting the theory, then describes the results of applying three alternative models to a corpus of 2-person dialogs.

For instance, in Example 5, the &apos;real&apos; topic of the first utterance is Jackson, but according to Modell the set of entities referred to by &amp;quot;we&amp;quot; is the Cb of both utterances. Example 5 [dialog 4248] A And like we went into Jackson, the town and / we were like â€” AAAHHH! let me out of here The annotators&apos; intuitions regarding the &apos;real&apos; topic often conflicted. It would be interesting to annotate actor and discourse focus separately, then see which one the Cb most closely matches. 5.3 Cheap versus expensive transitions Strube and Hahn (1996) propose a method of evaluating a model against centering rule 2, measuring the &apos;cost&apos; of the listener&apos;s inference load. A cheap transition has Cb,â€ž = CPnâ€”i, otherwise it is expensive. Models with a large percent of cheap transi1057% of Cb&apos;s in Modell are entities referred to via 1/2PPs. tions better reflect human notions of coherence. All three of our models produced a very low percent of cheap transitions in this experiment, especially when compared to Strube and Hahn&apos;s result of 80%. 6 Conclusions and Future work We conclude that centering behavior in dialog is consistent with that found in</context>
