<bodyText confidence="0.99973605">
An area of recent interest in cross-
language information retrieval (CLIR)
is the question of which parallel corpora
might be best suited to tasks in CLIR, or
even to what extent parallel corpora can
be obtained or are necessary. One pro-
posal, which in our opinion has been
somewhat overlooked, is that the Bible
holds a unique value as a multilingual
corpus, being (among other things)
widely available in a broad range of
languages and having a high coverage
of modern-day vocabulary. In this pa-
per, we test empirically whether this
claim is justified through a series of
validation tests on various information
retrieval tasks. Our results appear to in-
dicate that our methodology may sig-
nificantly outperform others recently
proposed.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999989555555555">
This paper describes an empirical evaluation of
the Bible as a resource for cross-language infor-
mation retrieval (CLIR). The paper is organized
as follows: section 2 describes the background to
this project and explains our need for CLIR. Sec-
tion 3 sets out the various alternatives available
(as far as multilingual corpora are concerned) for
the type of textual CLIR which we want to per-
form, and details in qualitative terms why the
Bible would appear to be a good candidate. In
section 4, we outline the mechanics behind the
&apos;Rosetta-Stone&apos; type method we use for cross-
language comparison. The manner in which both
this method, and the reliability of using the Bible
as the basis for cross-language comparison, are
validated is outlined in section 5, together with
the results of our tests. Finally, we conclude on
and discuss these results in section 6.

2 Background
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999562">
This paper describes a project which is part of a
larger, ongoing, undertaking, the goal of which is
to harvest a representative sample of material
from the internet and determine, on a very broad
scale, the answers to such questions as:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.987847">
• what ideas in the global public discourse
enjoy most currency;
• how the popularity of ideas changes over
time.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999589625">
Ideas are, of course, expressed in words; or, to
put it another way, a document&apos;s vocabulary is
likely to reveal something about the author&apos;s ide-
ology (Lakoff, 2002). In view of this, and since
ultimately we are interested in clustering the
documents harvested from the internet by their
ideology (and we understand&apos;ideology&apos; in the
broadest possible sense), we approach the prob-
lem as a textual information retrieval (IR) task.
There is another level of complexity to the
problem, however. The language of the internet
is not, of course, confined to English; on the con-
trary, the representation of other languages is
probably increasing (Hill and Hughes, 1998;
Nunberg, 2000). Thus, for our results to be repre-
sentative, we require a way to compare docu-
ments in one language to those in potentially any
other language. Essentially, we would like to
answer the question of how ideologically aligned
two documents are, regardless of their respective
languages. In cross-language IR, this must be
approached by the use of a parallel multilingual
corpus, or at least some kind of appropriate train-
ing material available in multiple languages.

Sydney, July 2006. c�2006 Association for Computational Linguistics
veloped by the Cross-Language Evaluation Fo-
rum (CLEF); see, for example, Gonzalo (2001).
This collection, and its most recent revision (at
the CLEF website, www.clef-campaign.org), are
based on news documents or governmental
communications. Use of such corpora is wide-
spread in much recent CLIR work; one such ex-
ample is Nie, Simard, Isabelle and Durand
(1999), which uses the Hansard corpus, parallel
French-English texts of eight years of the Cana-
dian parliamentary proceedings, to train a CLIR
model.
It should be noted that the stated objective of
CLEF is to &apos;develop and maintain an infrastruc-
ture for the testing and evaluation of information
retrieval systems operating on European lan-
guages&apos; (Peters 2001:1). Indeed, there is good
reason for this: CLEF is an activity under the
auspices of the European Commission. Likewise,
the Canadian Hansard corpus covers only Eng-
lish and French, the most widespread languages
of Canada. It is to be expected that governmental
institutions would have most interest in promot-
ing resources and research in the languages fal-
ling most within their respective domains.
But in many ways, not least for the computa-
tional linguistics community, nor for anyone in-
terested in understanding trends in global
opinion, this represents an inherent limitation.
Since many of the languages of interest for our
project are not European – Arabic is a good ex-
ample – resources such as the CLEF collection
will be insufficient by themselves. The output of
global news organizations is a more promising
avenue, because many such organizations make
an effort to provide translations in a wide variety
of languages. For example, the BBC news web-
site (http://news.bbc.co.uk/) provides translations
in 34 languages, as follows:
</bodyText>
<keyword confidence="0.768761375">
Albanian, Arabic, Azeri, Bengali, Bur-
mese, Chinese, Czech, English, French,
Hausa, Hindi, Indonesian, Kinyarwanda,

Russian, Serbian, Sinhala, Slovene, So-
mali, Spanish, Swahili, Tamil, Turkish,
Ukrainian, Urdu, Uzbek, Vietnamese
</keyword>
<bodyText confidence="0.999829125">
However, there is usually no assurance that a
news article in one language will be translated
into any, let alone all, of the other languages.
In view of this, even more promising still as a
parallel corpus for our purposes is the Bible. Res-
nik, Olsen and Diab (1999) elaborate on some of
the reasons for this: it is the world&apos;s most trans-
lated book, with translations in over 2,100 lan-
guages (often, multiple translations per language)
and easy availability, often in electronic form
and in the public domain; it covers a variety of
literary styles including narrative, poetry, and
correspondence; great care is taken over the
translations; it has a standard structure which
allows parallel alignment on a verse-by-verse
basis; and, perhaps surprisingly, its vocabulary
appears to have a high rate of coverage (as much
as 85%) of modern-day language. Resnik, Olsen
and Diab note that the Bible is small compared to
many corpora currently used in computational
linguistics research, but still falls within the
range of acceptability based on the fact that other
corpora of similar size are used; and as previ-
ously noted, the breadth of languages covered is
simply not available elsewhere. This in itself
makes the Bible attractive to us as a resource for
our CLIR task. It is an open question whether,
because of the Bible&apos;s content, relatively small
size, or some other attribute, it can successfully
be used for the type of CLIR we envisage. The
rest of this paper describes our attempt to estab-
lish a definitive answer to this question.

4 Methods for Cross-Language Com-
parison
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99996528">
All of the work described in this section was im-
plemented using the Sandia Text Analysis Exten-
sible Library (STANLEY). STANLEY allows
for information retrieval based on a standard vec-
tor model (Baeza-Yates and Ribeiro-Neto, 1999:
27-30) with term weighting based on log en-
tropy. Previous work (Bauer et al 2005) has
shown that the precision-recall curve for
STANLEY is better than many other published
algorithms; Dumais (1991) finds specifically that
the precision-recall curve for information re-
trieval based on log-entropy weighting compares
favorably to that for other weighting schemes.
Two distinct methods for cross-language com-
parison are described in this section, and these
are as follows.
The first method (Method 1) involves creating
a separate textual model for each &apos;minimal unit&apos;
of each translation of the Bible. A &apos;minimal unit&apos;
could be as small as a verse (e.g. Genesis 1:1),
but it could be a group of verses (e.g. Genesis
1:1-10); the key is that alignment is possible be-
cause of the chapter-and-verse structure of the
Bible, and that whatever grouping is used should
be the same in each translation. Thus, for each
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999964168831169">
language λwe end up with a set of models (m1,λ,
m2,λ, ... mn,λ). If the Bible is used as the parallel
corpus and the &apos;minimal unit&apos; is the verse, then n
= 31,102 (the number of verses in the Bible).
Let us suppose now that we wish to compare
document di with document dj, and that we hap-
pen to know that di is in English and dj is in Rus-
sian. In order to assess to what extent di and dj
are &apos;about&apos; the same thing, we treat the text of
each document as a query against all of the mod-
els in its respective language. So, di is evaluated
against m1,English, m2,English, ..., mn,English to give
simi,1, simi,2, ..., simi,n, where simx,y (a value be-
tween 0 and 1) represents the similarity of docu-
ment dx in language λto model mn in language λ,
based on the cosine of the angle between the vec-
tor for dx and the vector for mn. Similar evalua-
tions are performed for dj against the set of
models in Russian. Now, each set of n results for
a particular document can itself be thought of an
n-dimensional vector. Thus, di is associated with
(simi,1, simi,2, ..., simi,n) and dj with (simj,1, simj,2,
..., simj,n). To quantify the similarity between di
and dj, we now compute the cosine between
these two vectors to yield a single measure, also
a value between 0 and 1. In effect, we have used
the multilingual corpus – the Bible, in this case –
in &apos;Rosetta-Stone&apos; fashion to bridge the language
gap between di and dj. Method 1 is summarized
graphically in Figure 1, for two hypothetical
documents.
The second method of comparison (Method 2)
is quite similar. This time, however, instead of
building one set of textual models for each trans-
lation in language λ(m1,λ, m2,λ, ... mn,λ), we build
a single set of textual models for all translations,
with each language represented at least once (m1,
m2, ... mn). Thus, m1 might represent a model
based on the concatenation of Genesis 1:1 in
English, Russian, Arabic, and so on. In a fashion
similar to that of Method 1, each incoming
document di is evaluated as a query against m1,
m2, ..., mn, to give an n-dimensional vector
where each cell is a value between 0 and 1.
Method 2 is summarized graphically in Figure 2,
for just English and Russian.
There are at least two features of Method 2
which make it attractive, from a linguist&apos;s point
of view, for CLIR. The first is that it allows for
the possibility that a single input document may
be multilingual. In Figure 2, document dj is rep-
resented by an symbol with a mainly light-
colored background, but with a small dark-
colored section. This is intended to represent a
document with mainly English content, but some
small subsection in Russian. Under Method 1, in
which dj is compared to an English-language
model, the Russian content would have been ef-
fectively ignored, but under Method 2 this is no
longer the case. Accordingly, the hypothetical
similarity measure for the first &apos;minimal unit&apos; has
changed very slightly, as has the overall measure
of similarity between document di and dj.
The second linguistic attraction of Method 2 is
that it is not necessary to know a priori the lan-
guage of di or dj, providing that the language is
one of those for which we have textual data in
the model set. Since, as already stated, the Bible
covers over 2,100 languages, this should not be a
significant theoretical impediment.
The theoretical advantages of Method 1 have
principally to do with the ease of technical im-
plementation. New model sets for additional lan-
guages can be easily added as they become
available, whereas under Method 2 the entire
model set must be rebuilt (statistics recomputed,
etc.) each time a new language is added.

Bible as the basis for CLIR. In this section, we
consider how this choice may be validated em-
pirically. We would like to know how reliable
the cross-language comparison methods outlined
in the previous section are at identifying docu-
ments in different languages but which happen to
be similar in content. This reliability will be in
part a function of the particular text analysis
model we employ, but it will also be a function
of our choice of parallel text used to train the
model. The Bible has some undeniable qualita-
tive advantages for our purposes, but are the
CLIR results based on it satisfactory in practice?
Three tests are described in this section; the aim
of these is to provide an answer to this question.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998036">
5.1 Preliminary analysis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.990851735849057">
In order to obtain a preliminary idea of whether
this method was likely to work, we populated the
entire matrix of similarity measures, verse by
verse, for each language pair. There are 31,102
verses in the Bible (allowing for some variation
in versification between different translations,
which we carefully controlled for by adopting a
common versification schema). Thus, this step
involved building a 31,102 by 31,102 matrix for
each language pair, in which the cell in row m
and column n contains a number between 0 and 1
representing the similarity of verse m in one lan-
guage to verse n in the other language. If use of
the Bible for CLIR is a sound approach, we
would expect to see the highest similarity meas-
ures in what we will call the matrix&apos;s diagonal
values – the values occurring down the diagonal
of the matrix from top-left to bottom-right –
meaning that verse n in one language is most
similar to verse n in the other, for all n.
Here, we would simply like to note an inciden-
tal finding. We found that for certain language
pairs, the diagonal values were significantly
higher than for other language pairs, as shown in
Table 1.
One hypothesis we have is that the lower overall
similarity for English-Russian is at least partly
due to the fact that Russian is a much more
highly inflected language then any of English,
French, or Spanish. That many verses containing
non-dictionary forms are the ones that score the
highest for similarity, and many of those that do
not score lowest, appears to confirm this. How-
ever, there appear to be other factors at play as
well, since many of the highest-scoring verses
contain proper names or other infrequently oc-
curring lexical items (examples are Esther 9:9:
&apos;and Parmashta, and Arisai, and Aridai, and Vai-
zatha&apos;, and Exodus 37:19: &apos;three cups made like
almond-blossoms in one branch, a bud and a
flower, and three cups made like almond-
blossoms in the other branch, a bud and a flower:
so for the six branches going out of the lamp-
stand&apos;). A third possibility, consistent with the
first, is that Table 1 actually reflects more gen-
eral measures of similarity between languages,
the Western European languages (for example)
all being more closely related to Latin than their
Slavic counterparts. At any rate, if our hypothesis
about inflection being an important factor is cor-
rect, then this would seem to underline the im-
portance of stemming for highly-inflected
languages.

In this test, the CLIR algorithm is trained on the
entire Bible, and validation is performed against
available extra-Biblical multilingual corpora
such as the FQS (2006) and RALI (2006) cor-
pora. This test, together with the tests already
described, should provide a reliable measure of
how well our CLIR model will work when ap-
plied to our target domain (documents collected
from the internet).

In this table,&apos;Eng. 1&apos;, &apos;Sp. 1&apos;, etc., refer to the

In four out of five cases, the CLIR engine cor-
rectly predicted which English document was
related to which Spanish document, and in four
out of five cases it also correctly predicted which
Spanish document was related to which English
document. We can relate these results to tradi-
tional IR measures such as precision-recall and
mean average precision by using a query that
returns the top-most similar document. Thus, our
‘right’ answer set as well as our CLIR answers
will consist of a single document. For the FQS
corpus, this represents a mean average precision
(MAP) of 0.8 at a recall point of 1 (the first
document recalled). The incorrect cases were
Eng. 4, where Sp. 3 was predicted, and Sp. 3,
where Eng. 4 was predicted. (By way of possible
explanation, both these two documents included
the keywords &apos;qualitative research&apos; with the ab-
stract.) Furthermore, in most of the cases where
the prediction was correct, there is a clear margin
between the score for the correct choice and the
scores for the incorrect choices. This leads us to
believe that our general approach to CLIR is at
very least promising.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998949">
5.3 Validation on a larger test set
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999413333333333">
To address the question of whether the CLIR
approach performs as well on larger test sets,
where the possibility of an incorrect prediction is
greater simply because there are more documents
to select from, we trained the CLIR engine on the
Bible and validated it against the 114 suras of the
Quran, performing a four-by-four-way test using
the original Arabic (AR) text plus English (EN) ,
Russian (RU) and Spanish (ES) translations. The
MAP at a recall point of 1 is shown for each lan-
guage pair in Table 4.
This table shows, for example, that for 52.63%
(or 60) of the 114 English documents used as
input, the correct Spanish document was re-
trieved first. As with the results in the previous
section, we can relate these results to MAP at a
recall of 1. If we were to consider more than just
the top-most similar document in our CLIR out-
put, we would expect the chance of seeing the
correct document to increase. However, since in
this experiment the number of relevant docu-
ments can never exceed 1, the precision will be
diluted as more documents are retrieved (except
at the point when the one correct document is
retrieved). The values shown in the table are, of
course, greater by a couple of orders of magni-
tude than that expected of random retrieval, of
0.0088 (1/114). Our methodology appears sig-
nificantly to outperform that proposed by
McNamee and Mayfield (2004), who report an
MAP of 0.3539, and a precision of 0.4520 at a
recall level of 10, for English-to-Spanish CLIR
based on 5-gram tokenization. (We have not yet
been able to compare our results to McNamee
and Mayfield&apos;s using the same corpora that they
use, but we intend to do this later. We do not ex-
pect our results to differ significantly from those
we report above.) Perhaps not surprisingly, our
results appear to be better for more closely-
related languages, with pairs including Arabic
being consistently those with the lowest average
predictive precision across all suras.

human language which might be represented on
the internet can be covered, and the cost of add-
ing resources for each additional language is
relatively small), secondly, by extending the
training set with additional corpora, for available
language pairs. Doubtless, also, the methodology
could be further tuned for better performance.
It is perhaps surprising that the Bible has not
been more widely used as a multilingual corpus
by the computational linguistics and information
retrieval community. In fact, it usually appears to
be assumed by researchers that parallel texts,
particularly those which have been as carefully
translated as the Bible and are easy to align, are
scarce and hard to come by (for two examples,
see McNamee and Mayfield 2004 and Munteanu
and Marcu 2006). The reason for the Bible being
ignored may be the often unspoken assumption
that the domain of the Bible is too limited (being
a religious document) or that its content is too
archaic. Yet, the truth is that much of the Bible&apos;s
content has to do with enduring human concerns
(life, death, war, love, etc.), and if the language is
archaic, that may have more a matter of transla-
tion style than of content.
There are a number of future research direc-
tions in computational linguistics we would like
to pursue, besides those which may be of interest
in other disciplines. The first is to use this
framework to evaluate the relative faithfulness of
different translations. For example, we would
expect to see similar statistical relationships
within the model for a translation of the Bible as
are seen in its original languages (Hebrew and
Greek). Statistical comparisons could thus be
used as the basis for evaluating a translation&apos;s
faithfulness to the original. Such an analysis
could be of theological, as well as linguistic, in-
terest.
Secondly, we would like to examine whether
the model&apos;s performance can be improved by
introducing more sophisticated morphological
analysis, so that the units of analysis are mor-
phemes instead of words, or possibly morphemes
as well as words.
Third, we intend to investigate further which
of the two methods outlined in section 4 per-
forms better in cross-language comparison, par-
ticularly when the language of the source
document is unknown. In particular, we are in-
terested in the extent to which homographic cog-
nates across languages (e.g. French coin &apos;corner&apos;
versus English coin), may affect the performance
of the CLIR engine.

<abstract confidence="0.996248571428571">An area of recent interest in crosslanguage information retrieval (CLIR) is the question of which parallel corpora might be best suited to tasks in CLIR, or even to what extent parallel corpora can be obtained or are necessary. One proposal, which in our opinion has been somewhat overlooked, is that the Bible holds a unique value as a multilingual corpus, being (among other things) widely available in a broad range of languages and having a high coverage of modern-day vocabulary. In this paper, we test empirically whether this claim is justified through a series of validation tests on various information retrieval tasks. Our results appear to indicate that our methodology may significantly outperform others recently proposed.</abstract>

Finally, we conclude on and discuss these results in section 6. 2 Background This paper describes a project which is part of a larger, ongoing, undertaking, the goal of which is to harvest a representative sample of material from the internet and determine, on a very broad scale, the answers to such questions as: • what ideas in the global public discourse enjoy most currency; • how the popularity of ideas changes over time. Ideas are, of course, expressed in words; or, to put it another way, a document&apos;s vocabulary is likely to reveal something about the author&apos;s ideology (Lakoff, 2002). In view of this, and since ultimately we are interested in clustering the documents harvested from the internet by their ideology (and we understand&apos;ideology&apos; in the broadest possible sense), we approach the problem as a textual information retrieval (IR) task. There is another level of complexity to the problem, however. The language of the internet is not, of course, confined to English; on the contrary, the representation of other languages is probably increasing (Hill and Hughes, 1998; Nunberg, 2000). Thus, for our results to be representative, we require a way to compare documents in on</context>

If we were to consider more than just the top-most similar document in our CLIR output, we would expect the chance of seeing the correct document to increase. However, since in this experiment the number of relevant documents can never exceed 1, the precision will be diluted as more documents are retrieved (except at the point when the one correct document is retrieved). The values shown in the table are, of course, greater by a couple of orders of magnitude than that expected of random retrieval, of 0.0088 (1/114). Our methodology appears significantly to outperform that proposed by McNamee and Mayfield (2004), who report an MAP of 0.3539, and a precision of 0.4520 at a recall level of 10, for English-to-Spanish CLIR based on 5-gram tokenization. (We have not yet been able to compare our results to McNamee and Mayfield&apos;s using the same corpora that they use, but we intend to do this later. We do not expect our results to differ significantly from those we report above.) Perhaps not surprisingly, our results appear to be better for more closelyrelated languages, with pairs including Arabic being consistently those with the lowest average predictive precision across all suras. 6 Discussion In this pa</context>

It is perhaps surprising that the Bible has not been more widely used as a multilingual corpus by the computational linguistics and information retrieval community. In fact, it usually appears to be assumed by researchers that parallel texts, particularly those which have been as carefully translated as the Bible and are easy to align, are scarce and hard to come by (for two examples, see McNamee and Mayfield 2004 and Munteanu and Marcu 2006). The reason for the Bible being ignored may be the often unspoken assumption that the domain of the Bible is too limited (being a religious document) or that its content is too archaic. Yet, the truth is that much of the Bible&apos;s content has to do with enduring human concerns (life, death, war, love, etc.), and if the language is archaic, that may have more a matter of translation style than of content. There are a number of future research directions in computational linguistics we would like to pursue, besides those which may be of interest in other disciplines. </context>
