After a considerable hiatus of interest and funding,
machine translation has come in recent years to occupy a sig-
nificant place in the discipline of natural language processing.
It has also become one of the most visible representations of
natural language processing to the outside world. Machine
translation systems are relatively unique with respect to the
extent of the coverage they attempt, and, correspondingly,
the size of the grammatical and lexical corpora involved. Ad-
ding to this the complexity introduced by multiple language
directions into the same system design (and the enormous
procedural problems imposed by simultaneous development
in several sites) gives some clue as to the optimism which
presently exists for machine translation.
It is obviously believed in many quarters that computer
science and linguistic science have become sufficient for
production-environment machine translation. Private sector
companies continue to introduce new MT systems to the
marketplace worldwide, and many more are venturing into
development and implementation. The industrial interest,
meanwhile, has been instrumental in opening up possibilities
for doing basic research in it, in part because of direct inter-
action between industry and research, and in part because of
the overall increased awareness. It is indeed worth speculat-
ing whether renewed interest shown by governmental scien-
tific agencies is related to the level of commercial acceptance.
But some feel that this visibility causes more harm than
good. The concern has been expressed that an operational
failure in machine translation will be seen as a failure in
natural language processing generally, that a particular im-
plementation rejected by users could cause a snowball ul-
timately resulting in the demise not just of MT as in the AL-
PAC aftermath, but also of all of computational linguistics.
Some may go so far as to suggest that such a day of
reckoning will be inevitable as long as production-level
machine translation efforts continue.
If it is indeed the case that production machine trans-
lation is not feasible, then machine translation is at best a
heuristic environment for experimentation in linguistic
theory. And machine translation does serve such an end ad-
mirably well: the modularity of program and linguistic
description of which a well-designed translation system is
capable allows work on hypotheses within one linguistic
theory, or evaluation of different linguistic theories, without
fundamental changes to the computing environment.
Two positions are identified here, whose distance from
each other serves perhaps to encompass the whole range of
thought on the ultimate potential of machine translation, as
well as on the best possible design of a translating device.
The one position holds that MT is a viable production tool
whose benefit is more than worth the immense effort in-
volved in linguistic description, textual coverage, and coor-
dination of multi-national development. The other position
holds that MT is a useful laboratory for linguistic study in a
small, easily maintainable computing environment.
Despite the polarity, there is a common ground, which we
employ as the datum point from which to explore the issues
in machine translation today. We have progressed from the
debate about the possibility of machine translation to the
debate about what machine translation should be. This in
itself is indicative of our awareness of the progress of com-
putational linguistics as a whole.
