In this paper we report on initial research we have
conducted on a computational theory of prose style. Our
theory speaks to the following major points:
I. Where in the generation process style is taken into
account.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.960214454545455">
2. How a particular prose style is represented; what
&amp;quot;stylistic rules&amp;quot; look like;
3. What modifications to a generation algorithm are
needed; what the decision is that evaluates stylistic
alternatives;
4. What elaborations to the normal description of
surface structure are necessary to make it usable as
a plan for the text and a reference for these
decisions;
5. What kinds of information decisions about style
have access to.

Our theory emerged out of design experiments we have
made over the past year with our natural language
generation system, the Zetalisp program MUMBLE. In the
process we have extended MUMBLE through the addition
of an additional process that now mediates between content
planning and linguistic realization. This new process, which
we call &amp;quot;attachment&amp;quot;, provides the further significant benefit
that text structure is no longer dictated by the structure of
the message: the sequential order and dominance
relationships of concepts in the message no longer force one
form onto the words and phrases in the text. Instead,
rhetorical and intentional directives can be interpreted
flexibly in the context of the ongoing discourse and stylistic
preferences. The text is built up through composition under
the direction of linguistic organizing principles, rather than
having to follow conceptual principles in lockstep.
We will begin by describing what we mean by prose
style and then introducing the generation task that lead us
to this theory, the reproduction of short encyclopedia
articles on African tribes. We will then use that task to
outline the parts of our theory and the operations of the
attachment process. Finally we will compare our techniques
to the related work of Davey, McKeown and Derr, and
Gabriel, and consider some of the possible psycholinguistic
hypotheses that it may lead to.

2. Prose Style
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999577678571429">
Style is an intuitive notion involving the manner in
which something is said. It has been more often the
professional domain of literary critics and English teachers
than linguists, which is entirely reasonable given that it
involves ovtional, often conscious decisions and preferences
rather than the unconscious, inviolable rules that linguists
term Universal Grammar.
To illustrate what we mean by style, consider the three
paragraphs in Figure 1. As we see it, the first two of
these have the same style, and the third has a different
one.
The Ibibio are a group of six related peoples living
in southeastern Nigeria. They have a population
estimated at 1,500,000, and speak a language in the
Benue-Niger subfamily of the Niger-Congo
languages. Most Ibibio are subsistence farmers, but
two subgroups are fishermen.
The Ashanti are an AICAN-speaking people of
central Ghana and neighboring regions of Togo and
Ivory Coast, numbering more than 900,000. They
subsist primarily by farming cacao, a major cash
crop.

The first two of these paragraphs are extracted from
the Academic American Encyclopedia; they are the lead
paragraphs from the two articles on those respective tribes.
The third paragraph was written by taking the same
information that we have posited underlies the Ashanti
paragraph and regenerating from it with an impoverished
set of stylistic rules.
We began looking at texts like these during the
summer of 19€3, as part of the work on the &amp;quot;Knoesphere
Project&amp;quot; at Atari Research (13orning at al [1983D. Our goal
in that project was to develop a representation for the kind
of information appearing in encyclopedias which would not
be tied to the way in which it would be presented. The
same knowledge base objects were to be used whether one
was recreating an article like the original, or making a
simpler version to give to children, or answering isolated
questions about the material, or giving an interactive
multi-media presentation coordinated with maps and icons,
and so on.
With the demise of Atari Research, this ambitious goal
has had to be put on the shelf; we have, however,
continued to work with the articles on our own. Research
on these articles lead us to begin work on prose style. This
remains an interesting domain in which to explore style
since we are working with a body of texts whose
organization is not totally dictated by its internal form.
These paragraphs are representative of all the African
tribe articles in the Academic American, which is not
surprising since all of the articles were written by the same
person and under tight editorial control. What was most
striking to us when we first looked at these articles was
their similarity to each other, both in the information they
contained and the way they were structured as a text. We
will assume that for such texts, &amp;quot;encyclopedia style&amp;quot; involves
at least the following two generalizations: (1) be consistent
in the information that you provide about each tribe; and
(2) adopt a complex, &amp;quot;information loaded&amp;quot; sentence structure
in your presentation. This sentence structure is typified by
a rich set of syntactic constructions, including the use of
conjunction reduction, reduced relative clauses, coordination,
secondary adjunction, and prenominal modification whenever
possible.
A contrasting style might be, for example, one that was
aimed at children; we have rewritten the information on
the Ashanti tribe as it might look in such a style. We
have not yet tried implementing this style since it will call
for doing lexicalization under stylistic control, which we
have not yet designed.

3. Our Theory of Generation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.989019">
Looking at the generation process as a whole, we have
always presumed that it involved three different stages, with
our own research concentrating on the last.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.792179">
(1) Determining what goals to (attempt to) accomplish with
the utterance. This initiates the other activities and posts a
set of criteria they are to meet, typically information to be
conveyed (e.g. pointers to frames in the knowledge base)
and speech acts to be carried out.
(2) Deciding which specific propositions to express and
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.955694764705882">
which to leave for the audience to infer on their own.
This cannot be separated from working out what rhetorical
constructions to employ in expressing the specified speech
acts or from selecting the key lexical items for
communicating the propositions. The result of this activity
is a text plan, which has a principally conceptual vocabulary
with rhetorical and lexical annotations. The text plan is
seen by the next stage as an executable &amp;quot;specification&amp;quot; that
is to be incrementally converted into a text. The
specification is given in layers, i.e. not all of the details are
planned at once. Later, once the linguistic context of the
units within the specification has been determined, this
planner will be recursively invoked, unit by unit, until the
planning has been done in enough detail that only linguistic
problems remain.
(3) Maintaining a representation of the linguistic structure
of the utterance, traversing and Interpreting this structure
to produce the words of the text and constrain further
decisions. This stage is responsible for the grammaticality of
the text and its fluency as a discourse (e.g. insuring that
the correct terms are pronominalized, the correct focus
maintained, etc.). The central representation is an explicit
model of the surface structure of the text being produced,
which is used both to determine control flow and to
constrain the activities of the other processes (see discussion
in McDonald [19841). The surface structure is defined in
terms of a stream of phrasal nodes, constituent positions,
words, and embedded information units (which will
eventually have to te sent back to the planner and then
realized linguistically, extending the surface structure in the
process). The entities in the stream and their relative order
is indelible (i.e. once selected it cannot be changed);
however more material can be spliced into the stream at
specified points.

3.1 WHERE IS STYLE CONSIDERED?
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999761">
According to our theory, prose style Is a consequence
of what decisions are made during the transition from the
conceptual representational level to the linguistic level. The
conceptual representation of what is to be said—the text
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.993071">
188
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999922727272727">
plan—is modeled as a stream of information units selected
by the content planning component. The attachmeru process
takes units from this stream and positions them in the
surface structure somewhere ahead of the point of speech.
The prose style one adopts dictates what choice the
attachment process makes when faced with alternatives in
where to position a unit: should one extend a sentence with
a nonrestrictive relative clause or start a new one; express
modification with an prenominal adjective or a postnominal
prepositional phrase. The collective pattern of such
decisions is the computational manifestation of one&apos;s style.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.966913" genericHeader="method">
3.2 EXTENSIONS TO THE SURFACE STRUCTURE
REPRESENTATION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999844041666667">
The information units from the text plan are positioned
at one or another of the predefined &amp;quot;attachment points&amp;quot; in
the surface structure. These points are defined on
structural grounds by a grammar, and annotated according
to the rhetorical uses they can be put to (see later example
in Figure 8). They define the grammatically legitimate
ways that the surface structure might be extended: another
adjective added to a certain noun phrase, a temporal
adjunct added to a clause, another sentence added to a
paragraph, and so on.
Which attachment points exist at any moment is a
function of the surface structure&apos;s configuration at that
moment and where the point of speech is. Since the
configuration changes as units are added to the surface
structure or already positioned units are realized, the set of
available attachment points changes as well. This is
accomplished by including the points in the definitions of
the phrasal elements from which the surface structure is
built. We have since argued that this addition of
attachment point specifications to elementary trees is very
similar to the grammatical formalism used in Tree
Adjoining Grammars [Joshi 1983] and are actively exploring
the relationships between the two theories (d. McDonald &amp;
Pustejovsky [19854)
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.996867">
3.3 A DECISION PROCEDURE
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.975533352112676">
The job of the attachment process is to decide which
of the available attachment points it should use in
positioning a text plan unit in the surface structure. This
decision is a function of three kinds of things:
1. The different ways that the unit can be realized in
English, e.g. most adjectives can also be couched as
relative clauses, not all full clauses can be reduced
to participial adjectives.
2. The characteristics of the available attachment
points, especially the grammatical constraints that
they would impose on the realization of any unit
using them. The &amp;quot;new sentence&amp;quot; attachment will
require that the unit be expressible as a clause and
rule out one that could only be realized as a noun
phrase; attachment as the head of a noun phrase
would impose just the opposite constraint.
3. What stylistic rules have been defuied and the
predicates they apply to determine their
applicability.
The algorithm goes as follows. The units in the stream
from the text plan are considered one at a time in the
order that they appear. There is no buffering of
unpositioned units and no lookahead down the stream to
look for patterns among the units; any patterns that might
be significant are supposed to already have been seen by
the text planner and indicated by passing down composite
units.1 Each unit is thus considered on its own, on the
basis of how it can be realized.
The total set of alternative phrasings for an information
unit are precomputed and stored within the linguistic
component (i.e the third stage of the process) as a
&amp;quot;realization class&amp;quot;. Different choices of syntactic
arrangement, optional arguments, idiomatic wordings, etc.
are anticipated before hand (by the linguist, not the
program) and grouped together along with characteristics
that describe the uses to which the different choices can be
put: which choice focuses which argument; which one
presumes that the audience will already understand a
certain relationship, which one not. (Realization classes are
discussed at greater length in McDonald &amp; Pustejovsky
[1985bD.
The rust step in the attachment algorithm is to
compute all legitimate pairings of attachment points and
choices in the unit&apos;s realization class, e.g. a unit might be
attached at a NP premodifier point using its adjective
realization; or as postmodifier using its participial
realization; or as the next sentence in the paragraph using
any of its several realizations as a root clause. This
particular case is the one in our example in Section 4.
The characteristics on each of the active attachment
points will be compared with the characteristics on each of
the choices in the unit&apos;s realization class. Any choice that
is compatible with a given attachment point is grouped with
it in a set; if that attachment point is selected, a later
decision will be made among the choices in that set.
Once the attachment point/choice set pairs have been
computed, the next step is to order them according to
which is most consistent with the present prose style. This
is where the stylistic rules are employed. Once the pairs
are ordered, we select the pair judged to be the best and
use it. The unit is spliced into the surface structure at the
selected attachment point, and the choices consistent with
1 Assuming that the critetial division between conceptual/rhetorical
planning and linguistic realization is that only the linguistic side
understands grammar. e.g. the opportunities and constraints implicit in
the surface structure at a given moment (we think that both sides
should be designed to appreciate the lexicon), then this restriction
implies that there will be no opportunistic reconfiguring of the text
plan by the linguistic component, no condensing parallel predicates into
conjunctions or grouping of modifiers etc. unless there is a specifically
planned rhetorical motive for doing so dictated by the planner.

that point set up for later selection (realization of the unit)
once that point is reached by the linguistic component in
its traversal.

3.4 STYLISTIC RULES
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9866596">
As we have just said, the computational job of a
stylistic rule is to identify preferences among attachment
points.2 This means that the rules themselves can have a
very simple structure. Each rule has the following three
parts:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.86331">
1. A name. This symbol is for the convenience of
the human designer; it does not take part in the
computation.
2. An ordered list of attachment points.
3. A predicate that can be evaluated in the
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.991642571428571">
environment accessible within the attachment
process. If the predicate is satisfied, the rule is
applicable.
Each stylistic rule states a preference between specific
attachment points, as given by the ordering it defines. To
perform the sorting then, one performs a fairly simple
calculation (n.b. it is simple but lengthy; see footnote).
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.8582539">
(1) For each candidate attachment point, collect all of
the stylistic rules that mention it in their ordered
lists; discard any rules that do not mention at least
one of the other candidate points as well.
(2) Evaluate the applicability predicates of the collected
rules and discard any that fail.
(3) Using the rules that remain, sort the list of
candidate attachment points so that its order matches
the partial orders defined by the individual stylistic
rule!.

five points which we said at the onset of this paper had to

At the present time we are repmentius the
information about a tribe in a frame language kiowa as
ARLO [Haase 1984], which is a CottmonLisp
implementation of RLL. We have no stock in this
representation per se, nor, for that matter, in the specific
details of the frames we have built (though we are fairly
pleased with both); our system has worked from other
representations in the past and we expect to work with still
others in the future. Rather, this choice provides us with
an expeditious, non-linguistic source for the articles, which
has the characteristics we expect of modern representations.

2 At present &amp;quot;preference is defined by sorting candidate
point-choice pair, leasnst the rules and selecting the topmost one: it
is easy to see hi less computationally intensive schemes could be
worked out. Some stylistic rules should probably be allowed to &apos;veto&amp;quot;
whole classes of attachment points and others able to declare
themselves always the best. Furthermore these rules naturally fall into
groups by specialization and features held in common, suggesting that
the &amp;quot;sort&amp;quot; operation cot, be sped up by taking advantage of that
structure in the algorithm rather than simply sorting against all of the
stylistic rules uniformly. We have worked out on pape, how such
alternatives would go, and expect to implement them later this yeat.
3 In ARLO slots are ifirst-class objects with a prototype hierarchy
of their own just like the one for units (frames). The list of slots
is effectively a list of access functions whose domain is units (the
tribe being described) and whose range is also units (the slot values).
When this script is instantiated, the generator will receive a list of
&amp;quot;.i-..;4c records: slot, unit, and value.

<bodyText confidence="0.9998595">
If any of these slots are empty or &amp;quot;not interesting&amp;quot; for the
tribe, it is simply left out. The interface between planner
and realization can be this simple because the type of text
we are generating is fairly programmatic and predictable.
With a more complicated task comes a more sophisticated
planner. The point here, however, is to examine a simple
planning domain in order to isolate those decisions that are
purely stylistic in nature.

4.2 Attachment
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.925832033898305">
To illustrate what attachment adds, let us rust look
what the usual alternative procedure, direct translation,4
would do with the information plan we use for these
paragraphs. It would realize the items in the script one by
one, maintaining the given order, and the resulting text
would look like this (assuming the system had a reasonable
command of pronominalization):
The Ashatui are an African people. They live in central
Ghana and neighboring regions of Togo and Ivory Coast. This
is in West Africa. Their population is more than 900,000.
They speak the language Akan. They subsist primarily by
farming cacao. This is a major cash crop.
Figure 5 Paragraph II by Direct Replacement
Although true to the information in the script, this
method does not refltal the complex stylistic variations and
enrichments that make up the original paragraph. There
must be something above the level of a single information
unit to coordinate the flow of text, while not altering the
intentions or goals of the planner. With this in mind, we
have built a stylistic controller which has the following
properties:
o It allows information to be &amp;quot;folded in&amp;quot; to already
planned text. Items in the script do not necessarily
appear in the same order in the text.
o The decision about when to fold things in is made
on the basis of style; i.e. if the style had been
different, the text would have been different as well.
o The points where new material may be added to
planned text are defined on structural grounds.
For example, notice that in paragraph II from Figure I
the language-field is realized as as a compound adjectival
phrase, modifying the prototype; viz. &amp;quot;Akan-speaking.&amp;quot; For
the first article, however, the language-field is realized
differently. The attachment-point that allows this &amp;quot;fold-in&amp;quot;
4 &amp;quot;Direct translation&amp;quot; is a term coined by Mann et al. [19811 to
describe the techniques used by most of the generation systems in use
to day with working expert systems. It entails taking a complex
structure from the system&apos;s knowledge base as the text source (in this
case our list of slots) and building from it a discourse that matches
it exactly in structure by recursively selecting texts for its sourse.
(i.e. attach-as-adjective) is introduced by the realization
class for the prototype field. The decision to select this
phrase over the sentential form in Figure 5 is made by a
stylistic rule. This rule (cf. Figure 6) states that the
adjectival form is preferred if the language name has its
own encyclopedia entry.5 We see that this stylistic rule is
no satisfied in Paragraph I, hence another avenue must be
taxen (namely, clausal). The other attachment points used
by the stylistic rules determine whether to use a reduced
relative clause, a new sentence, or perhaps an ellipsed
phrase. The stylistic rule allowing this structure is given
below in Figure 6.

Consider now the derivation of the first sentence of
Paragraph I, and how the stylistic rules constrain the
attachment process. The first unit to be planned as surface
structure is the prototype field—the essential attribute of the
object. This introduces, as mentioned above, an attachment
point on the Ni&apos; now:, allowing additional information to
be added to me surtace structure. The realization class
associated with the language field for the Ashanti is
transitive-verb, represented in Figure 7 below.
5 This rule is particular to the encyclopedia domain, of course,
and makes reference to information specifically germaine to
encyclopedias. The rule, however. is to the point, and appears to be
productive; e.g. &amp;quot;wheat farmers&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;town dwellers&amp;quot;, etc.

5. Comparisons with other Research in
Language Generation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99967862962963">
Two earlier projects are quite close to our own though
for complementary reasons. Derr and McKeown [1984]
produce paragraph length texts by combining individual
information units of comparable complexity to our own,
into a series of compound sentences interspersed with
rhetoncal connectives. Their system is an improvement over
that of Davey 11978] (which it otherwise closely resembles)
because of its sensitivity to discourse-level influences such as
focus.
The standard technique for combining a sequence of
conceptual units into a text has been &amp;quot;direct replacement&amp;quot;
(see discussion in Mann et al. [1982D, in which the
sequential organization of the zex- is identical to that of
the message because the message is used directly as a
template. Our use of attachment dramatically improves on
this technique by relieving the message planner of any need
to know how to organize a surface structure, letting it rely
instead on explicitly stated stylistic criteria operating after
the planning is completed.
Derr and McKeown [1984] also improve on direct
replacement&apos;s one-proposition-for-one-sentence forced style by
permitting the combination of individual information units
(of comparable complexity to our own) into compound
sentences intersvased with rhetorical connectives. They
were, however, limited to extending sentences only at their
ends, while our attachment process can add units at any
grammatically licit position ahead of the point of speech.
Furthermore they ao not yet express combination criteria as
explicit, separable rules.
Dick Gabriel&apos;s program Yh [1984] produced polished
written texts through the use of critics and repeated editing.
It maintained a very similar model to our own of how a
text&apos;s structure can be elaborated, and produced texts of
quite high fluency. We differ from Gabriel in trying to
achieve fluency in a single online pass in the manner of a
person talking off the top of his head; this requires us to
put much more of the responsibility for fluency in the
pre-linguistic text planner, which is undoubtedly subject to
limitations.
It is our belief that, for script-like domains, online text
generation suffices. This method, in fact, provides us with
an interesting diagnostic to test our theory of style: namely,
that stylistic rules are meaning-preserving, and do not
change the goals or intentions of the speaker. Stylistic
rules are to be distinguished from those syntactic rules of
grammar which affect the semantic interpretation of a
syntactic expression. A non-restrictive relative, for example,
is a particular stylistic construction that adds no
meaning-delimiting predication to the denotation of the NP.
Use of a restrictive relative, on the other hand, is not a
matter of style, but of interpretation; &amp;quot;the man who owns a
donkey&amp;quot; is not a stylistic variant of the proposition &amp;quot;The
man owns a donkey.&amp;quot; In other words, the stylistic
component has no reference to intentions, goals, focus, etc.

At the time this is being written, the core data
structures and interpreters of the program have been
implemented and debugged, along with the set of
attachment-points and stylistic rules, which are necessary to
reproduce the paragraphs. The stylistic planner is
completely integrated with the language generation program
and has produced texts for scene descriptions (McDonald
and Conklin (forthcoming)), narrative summaries (Cook,
Lehnert, McDonald, [1984]), and two of the three
paragraphs shown in Figure 1.
Currently we are shifting domains to generate
newspaper articles, in the style of the New York Times.
We have only a single style worked out in detail, but we
would like to handle styles involving alternative lexical
choices, as well.
Ultimately what is most exciting to us is the
opportunity that we now have to use this framework to
develop precise hypotheses about the nature of the
&amp;quot;planning unit&amp;quot; in human language generation. This has
been an important question in psycholinguistic research as
well (Garrett (1982]). This continues our ongoing line of
research on the psychological consequences of our
computational analysis of generation. The following are a
few of the questions that must be addressed in the research
on planning.
o What is the size of the planning units at various
stages;
o What is the vocabulary that the units are stated in,
e.g. are conceptual and linguistic objects mixed
together or are there distinct unit-types at different
levels, with some means of cascading between levels;
o Should units be modelled as &amp;quot;streams&amp;quot; with
conceptual components passing in at one end and
text passing out at the other, or are they &amp;quot;quanta&amp;quot;
that must be processed in their entirety one after
the other; and finally
o Can the components of a planning unit be revised
after they are selected, or may they only be
refined. This appears to relate to similar questions
in psycholinguistic research (see Garrett [1982] for
review).

<abstract confidence="0.991831316993466">1. Abstract In this paper we report on initial research we have conducted on a computational theory of prose style. Our theory speaks to the following major points: I. Where in the generation process style is taken into account. 2. How a particular prose style is represented; what &amp;quot;stylistic rules&amp;quot; look like; 3. What modifications to a generation algorithm are needed; what the decision is that evaluates stylistic alternatives; 4. What elaborations to the normal description of surface structure are necessary to make it usable as a plan for the text and a reference for these decisions; 5. What kinds of information decisions about style have access to. Our theory emerged out of design experiments we have made over the past year with our natural language generation system, the Zetalisp program MUMBLE. In the process we have extended MUMBLE through the addition of an additional process that now mediates between content planning and linguistic realization. This new process, which we call &amp;quot;attachment&amp;quot;, provides the further significant benefit that text structure is no longer dictated by the structure of the message: the sequential order and dominance relationships of concepts in the message no longer force one form onto the words and phrases in the text. Instead, rhetorical and intentional directives can be interpreted flexibly in the context of the ongoing discourse and stylistic preferences. The text is built up through composition under the direction of linguistic organizing principles, rather than having to follow conceptual principles in lockstep. We will begin by describing what we mean by prose style and then introducing the generation task that lead us to this theory, the reproduction of short encyclopedia articles on African tribes. We will then use that task to outline the parts of our theory and the operations of the attachment process. Finally we will compare our techniques to the related work of Davey, McKeown and Derr, and Gabriel, and consider some of the possible psycholinguistic hypotheses that it may lead to. 2. Prose Style Style is an intuitive notion involving the manner in which something is said. It has been more often the professional domain of literary critics and English teachers than linguists, which is entirely reasonable given that it ovtional,often conscious decisions and preferences rather than the unconscious, inviolable rules that linguists term Universal Grammar. To illustrate what we mean by style, consider the three paragraphs in Figure 1. As we see it, the first two of these have the same style, and the third has a different one. The Ibibio are a group of six related peoples living in southeastern Nigeria. They have a population estimated at 1,500,000, and speak a language in the Benue-Niger subfamily of the Niger-Congo languages. Most Ibibio are subsistence farmers, but two subgroups are fishermen. The Ashanti are an AICAN-speaking people of central Ghana and neighboring regions of Togo and Ivory Coast, numbering more than 900,000. They subsist primarily by farming cacao, a major cash crop. The Ashanti are an African people. They live in central Ghana and neighboring regions of Togo and Ivory Coast. Their population is more than 900,000. They speak the language Akan. They subsist primarily by farming cacao. This is a major cash crop. Figure 1 Three paragraphs, two styles 187 The first two of these paragraphs are extracted from the Academic American Encyclopedia; they are the lead paragraphs from the two articles on those respective tribes. The third paragraph was written by taking the same information that we have posited underlies the Ashanti paragraph and regenerating from it with an impoverished set of stylistic rules. We began looking at texts like these during the summer of 19€3, as part of the work on the &amp;quot;Knoesphere Project&amp;quot; at Atari Research (13orning at al [1983D. Our goal in that project was to develop a representation for the kind of information appearing in encyclopedias which would not be tied to the way in which it would be presented. The same knowledge base objects were to be used whether one was recreating an article like the original, or making a simpler version to give to children, or answering isolated questions about the material, or giving an interactive multi-media presentation coordinated with maps and icons, and so on. With the demise of Atari Research, this ambitious goal has had to be put on the shelf; we have, however, continued to work with the articles on our own. Research on these articles lead us to begin work on prose style. This remains an interesting domain in which to explore style since we are working with a body of texts whose organization is not totally dictated by its internal form. These paragraphs are representative of all the African tribe articles in the Academic American, which is not surprising since all of the articles were written by the same person and under tight editorial control. What was most striking to us when we first looked at these articles was their similarity to each other, both in the information they contained and the way they were structured as a text. We will assume that for such texts, &amp;quot;encyclopedia style&amp;quot; involves at least the following two generalizations: (1) be consistent in the information that you provide about each tribe; and (2) adopt a complex, &amp;quot;information loaded&amp;quot; sentence structure in your presentation. This sentence structure is typified by a rich set of syntactic constructions, including the use of conjunction reduction, reduced relative clauses, coordination, secondary adjunction, and prenominal modification whenever possible. A contrasting style might be, for example, one that was aimed at children; we have rewritten the information on the Ashanti tribe as it might look in such a style. We have not yet tried implementing this style since it will call for doing lexicalization under stylistic control, which we have not yet designed. &amp;quot;The Ashanti are an African people. They live in West Africa in a country called Ghana and in parts of Togo and the Ivory Coast. There are about 9001)00 people in this tribe, and they speak a language named AKAN. Most of the Asharui are cacao farmers.&amp;quot; Figure 2 The style of the Academic American paragraphs, on the other hand, is much tighter, with more compact sentence structure, and a more sophisticated choice of phrasing. Such differences are the sort of thing that rules of prose style must capture. 3. Our Theory of Generation Looking at the generation process as a whole, we have always presumed that it involved three different stages, with our own research concentrating on the last. (1) Determining what goals to (attempt to) accomplish with the utterance. This initiates the other activities and posts a set of criteria they are to meet, typically information to be conveyed (e.g. pointers to frames in the knowledge base) and speech acts to be carried out. (2) Deciding which specific propositions to express and which to leave for the audience to infer on their own. This cannot be separated from working out what rhetorical constructions to employ in expressing the specified speech acts or from selecting the key lexical items for communicating the propositions. The result of this activity a plan, has a principally conceptual vocabulary with rhetorical and lexical annotations. The text plan is seen by the next stage as an executable &amp;quot;specification&amp;quot; that is to be incrementally converted into a text. The specification is given in layers, i.e. not all of the details are planned at once. Later, once the linguistic context of the units within the specification has been determined, this planner will be recursively invoked, unit by unit, until the planning has been done in enough detail that only linguistic problems remain. (3) Maintaining a representation of the linguistic structure of the utterance, traversing and Interpreting this structure to produce the words of the text and constrain further decisions. This stage is responsible for the grammaticality of the text and its fluency as a discourse (e.g. insuring that the correct terms are pronominalized, the correct focus maintained, etc.). The central representation is an explicit of the structure the text being produced, which is used both to determine control flow and to constrain the activities of the other processes (see discussion in McDonald [19841). The surface structure is defined in terms of a stream of phrasal nodes, constituent positions, words, and embedded information units (which will have to back to the planner and then realized linguistically, extending the surface structure in the process). The entities in the stream and their relative order is indelible (i.e. once selected it cannot be changed); however more material can be spliced into the stream at specified points. 3.1 WHERE IS STYLE CONSIDERED? According to our theory, prose style Is a consequence what made during the transition from the conceptual representational level to the linguistic level. The conceptual representation of what is to be said—the text 188 plan—is modeled as a stream of information units selected the content planning component. The process takes units from this stream and positions them in the surface structure somewhere ahead of the point of speech. The prose style one adopts dictates what choice the attachment process makes when faced with alternatives in where to position a unit: should one extend a sentence with a nonrestrictive relative clause or start a new one; express modification with an prenominal adjective or a postnominal prepositional phrase. The collective pattern of such decisions is the computational manifestation of one&apos;s style. 3.2 EXTENSIONS TO THE SURFACE STRUCTURE REPRESENTATION The information units from the text plan are positioned at one or another of the predefined &amp;quot;attachment points&amp;quot; in the surface structure. These points are defined on structural grounds by a grammar, and annotated according to the rhetorical uses they can be put to (see later example in Figure 8). They define the grammatically legitimate ways that the surface structure might be extended: another adjective added to a certain noun phrase, a temporal adjunct added to a clause, another sentence added to a paragraph, and so on. Which attachment points exist at any moment is a function of the surface structure&apos;s configuration at that moment and where the point of speech is. Since the configuration changes as units are added to the surface structure or already positioned units are realized, the set of available attachment points changes as well. This is accomplished by including the points in the definitions of the phrasal elements from which the surface structure is built. We have since argued that this addition of attachment point specifications to elementary trees is very similar to the grammatical formalism used in Tree Adjoining Grammars [Joshi 1983] and are actively exploring the relationships between the two theories (d. McDonald &amp; Pustejovsky [19854) 3.3 A DECISION PROCEDURE The job of the attachment process is to decide which of the available attachment points it should use in positioning a text plan unit in the surface structure. This decision is a function of three kinds of things: 1. The different ways that the unit can be realized in English, e.g. most adjectives can also be couched as relative clauses, not all full clauses can be reduced to participial adjectives. 2. The characteristics of the available attachment points, especially the grammatical constraints that they would impose on the realization of any unit using them. The &amp;quot;new sentence&amp;quot; attachment will require that the unit be expressible as a clause and rule out one that could only be realized as a noun phrase; attachment as the head of a noun phrase would impose just the opposite constraint. 3. What stylistic rules have been defuied and the predicates they apply to determine their applicability. The algorithm goes as follows. The units in the stream from the text plan are considered one at a time in the order that they appear. There is no buffering of unpositioned units and no lookahead down the stream to look for patterns among the units; any patterns that might be significant are supposed to already have been seen by the text planner and indicated by passing down composite Each unit is thus considered on its own, on the basis of how it can be realized. The total set of alternative phrasings for an information unit are precomputed and stored within the linguistic component (i.e the third stage of the process) as a &amp;quot;realization class&amp;quot;. Different choices of syntactic arrangement, optional arguments, idiomatic wordings, etc. are anticipated before hand (by the linguist, not the program) and grouped together along with characteristics that describe the uses to which the different choices can be put: which choice focuses which argument; which one presumes that the audience will already understand a certain relationship, which one not. (Realization classes are discussed at greater length in McDonald &amp; Pustejovsky [1985bD. in the attachment algorithm is to compute all legitimate pairings of attachment points and choices in the unit&apos;s realization class, e.g. a unit might be attached at a NP premodifier point using its adjective realization; or as postmodifier using its participial realization; or as the next sentence in the paragraph using any of its several realizations as a root clause. This particular case is the one in our example in Section 4. The characteristics on each of the active attachment points will be compared with the characteristics on each of the choices in the unit&apos;s realization class. Any choice that is compatible with a given attachment point is grouped with it in a set; if that attachment point is selected, a later decision will be made among the choices in that set. Once the attachment point/choice set pairs have been computed, the next step is to order them according to which is most consistent with the present prose style. This is where the stylistic rules are employed. Once the pairs are ordered, we select the pair judged to be the best and use it. The unit is spliced into the surface structure at the selected attachment point, and the choices consistent with 1 Assuming that the critetial division between conceptual/rhetorical planning and linguistic realization is that only the linguistic side understands grammar. e.g. the opportunities and constraints implicit in the surface structure at a given moment (we think that both sides should be designed to appreciate the lexicon), then this restriction implies that there will be no opportunistic reconfiguring of the text plan by the linguistic component, no condensing parallel predicates into conjunctions or grouping of modifiers etc. unless there is a specifically planned rhetorical motive for doing so dictated by the planner. 189 that point set up for later selection (realization of the unit) once that point is reached by the linguistic component in its traversal. 3.4 STYLISTIC RULES As we have just said, the computational job of a stylistic rule is to identify preferences among attachment This means that the rules themselves can have a very simple structure. Each rule has the following three parts: 1. A name. This symbol is for the convenience of the human designer; it does not take part in the computation. 2. An ordered list of attachment points. 3. A predicate that can be evaluated in the environment accessible within the attachment process. If the predicate is satisfied, the rule is applicable. Each stylistic rule states a preference between specific attachment points, as given by the ordering it defines. To perform the sorting then, one performs a fairly simple calculation (n.b. it is simple but lengthy; see footnote). (1) For each candidate attachment point, collect all of the stylistic rules that mention it in their ordered lists; discard any rules that do not mention at least one of the other candidate points as well. (2) Evaluate the applicability predicates of the collected rules and discard any that fail. (3) Using the rules that remain, sort the list of candidate attachment points so that its order matches the partial orders defined by the individual stylistic rule!. have now looked at our treatment of four of the five points which we said at the onset of this paper had to by any theory of prose style. The fifth point, the kinds of information stylistic rules are allowed to have access to, requires some background illustration before can be addressed; we take up at the end of our 4. An Example 4.1 Underlying representation At the present time we are repmentius the information about a tribe in a frame language kiowa as ARLO [Haase 1984], which is a CottmonLisp implementation of RLL. We have no stock in this representation per se, nor, for that matter, in the specific details of the frames we have built (though we are fairly pleased with both); our system has worked from other representations in the past and we expect to work with still others in the future. Rather, this choice provides us with an expeditious, non-linguistic source for the articles, which has the characteristics we expect of modern representations. Figure 2 shows the toplevel ARLO frame for the Ashanti and one of its subframes. (dekrdt Ashanti (Prototype #&gt;atrIcan-trIbe) (encyclopedia-unit? t) (location #&gt;Ashariti-locatkm) (population #&gt;Ashenti-poptlation) (language #&gt;Akan) (economic-bases #&gt;Ashanti-economy)) (dettrdt #&gt;Akan (Prototype #&gt;languaTie (encyclopedia-unit? t) (speaker #&gt;Ashant1)) Ashanti ARLO-tudt Given this representation, it is a straightforward matter to define a fixed script that can serve as the message-level source for the paragraphs. We simply list the slots that the desired (define-script deAault-trIbe-Introductoty-paragraph (tribe) ( #&gt;PrualltyPa Text Script Structure present &amp;quot;preference is defined by sorting candidate leasnst the rules and selecting the topmost one: it is easy to see hi less computationally intensive schemes could be worked out. Some stylistic rules should probably be allowed to &apos;veto&amp;quot; whole classes of attachment points and others able to declare themselves always the best. Furthermore these rules naturally fall into groups by specialization and features held in common, suggesting that the &amp;quot;sort&amp;quot; operation cot, be sped up by taking advantage of that structure in the algorithm rather than simply sorting against all of the stylistic rules uniformly. We have worked out on pape, how such alternatives would go, and expect to implement them later this yeat. 3In ARLO slots are ifirst-class objects with a prototype hierarchy of their own just like the one for units (frames). The list of slots is effectively a list of access functions whose domain is units (the tribe being described) and whose range is also units (the slot values). When this script is instantiated, the generator will receive a list of &amp;quot;.i-..;4c records: slot, unit, and value. 190 If any of these slots are empty or &amp;quot;not interesting&amp;quot; for the tribe, it is simply left out. The interface between planner and realization can be this simple because the type of text we are generating is fairly programmatic and predictable. With a more complicated task comes a more sophisticated planner. The point here, however, is to examine a simple planning domain in order to isolate those decisions that are purely stylistic in nature. 4.2 Attachment To illustrate what attachment adds, let us rust look the usual alternative procedure, direct would do with the information plan we use for these paragraphs. It would realize the items in the script one by one, maintaining the given order, and the resulting text would look like this (assuming the system had a reasonable command of pronominalization): The Ashatui are an African people. They live in central Ghana and neighboring regions of Togo and Ivory Coast. This is in West Africa. Their population is more than 900,000. They speak the language Akan. They subsist primarily by farming cacao. This is a major cash crop. 5 Paragraph II by Replacement Although true to the information in the script, this method does not refltal the complex stylistic variations and enrichments that make up the original paragraph. There must be something above the level of a single information unit to coordinate the flow of text, while not altering the intentions or goals of the planner. With this in mind, we have built a stylistic controller which has the following properties: o It allows information to be &amp;quot;folded in&amp;quot; to already planned text. Items in the script do not necessarily appear in the same order in the text. o The decision about when to fold things in is made on the basis of style; i.e. if the style had been different, the text would have been different as well. o The points where new material may be added to planned text are defined on structural grounds. For example, notice that in paragraph II from Figure I the language-field is realized as as a compound adjectival phrase, modifying the prototype; viz. &amp;quot;Akan-speaking.&amp;quot; For the first article, however, the language-field is realized differently. The attachment-point that allows this &amp;quot;fold-in&amp;quot; 4&amp;quot;Direct translation&amp;quot; is term by Mann et al. [19811 to describe the techniques used by most of the generation systems in use to day with working expert systems. It entails taking a complex structure from the system&apos;s knowledge base as the text source (in this case our list of slots) and building from it a discourse that matches in structure by recursively selecting texts for its sourse. (i.e. attach-as-adjective) is introduced by the realization class for the prototype field. The decision to select this phrase over the sentential form in Figure 5 is made by a stylistic rule. This rule (cf. Figure 6) states that the adjectival form is preferred if the language name has its encyclopedia We see that this stylistic rule is no satisfied in Paragraph I, hence another avenue must be taxen (namely, clausal). The other attachment points used by the stylistic rules determine whether to use a reduced relative clause, a new sentence, or perhaps an ellipsed phrase. The stylistic rule allowing this structure is given below in Figure 6. (define-styllstic-rule PREFER-NOUN-AW-COMPOUND-TO-POSTNOM orderIng-on-attachment-points ( attach-as-adjective attach-as-postnorninal-phrase ) applicabWty-condltIon (encyclopedia-entry/ Noun)) (define-stylistic-Me PREFER-ADJECTIVES-TO-NEW-SENTENCE ordering-on-attachment-points (attach-es-adjectNe attach-as-new-sentence ) appficabIllty-condtUon &apos;attach-as-adjective usable-attachment-points) (not (or (wW-be-complex-adjectIve-phrase (usable-choices &apos;attach-as-adjective)) (too-heavy-wIth-adjectives (np-belng-attached-to &apos;attach-as-adjectIve)))))) Figure 6 Stylistic Rules Consider now the derivation of the first sentence of Paragraph I, and how the stylistic rules constrain the attachment process. The first unit to be planned as surface structure is the prototype field—the essential attribute of the object. This introduces, as mentioned above, an attachment point on the Ni&apos; now:, allowing additional information to be added to me surtace structure. The realization class associated with the language field for the Ashanti is transitive-verb, represented in Figure 7 below. is particular to the encyclopedia domain, of course, and makes reference to information specifically germaine to encyclopedias. The rule, however. is to the point, and appears to be productive; e.g. &amp;quot;wheat farmers&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;town dwellers&amp;quot;, etc. 191 (define-reallzation-ciass transru&apos;ve-verb : parameters (agent object verb) : choices (( (defautt-active-form verb agent object) clause) A speaks B ( (passive-form verb agent object) clause In-focus(obj) ) B is spoken by A ( (gen/Wive-with-subject verb stbj °bp A speaking B np) ( (gensidve-paselve-wIth-subject verb stbj obj) being spoken by np In-focus(obp) ( (adjectival-form verb object) AdjP expresses-theme(B) ) : B-speaking Figure 7 Realization Class for Transitive Verb Because of the stylistic rules, the compound-adjectival form preferred.

Comparisons with other Research in Language Generation Two earlier projects are quite close to our own though for complementary reasons. Derr and McKeown [1984] produce paragraph length texts by combining individual information units of comparable complexity to our own, into a series of compound sentences interspersed with rhetoncal connectives. Their system is an improvement over that of Davey 11978] (which it otherwise closely resembles) because of its sensitivity to discourse-level influences such as focus. The standard technique for combining a sequence of conceptual units into a text has been &amp;quot;direct replacement&amp;quot; (see discussion in Mann et al. [1982D, in which the sequential organization of the zexis identical to that of the message because the message is used directly as a template. Our use of attachment dramatically improves on this technique by relieving the message planner of any need to know how to organize a surface structure, letting it rely instead on explicitly stated stylistic criteria operating after the planning is completed. Derr and McKeown [1984] also improve on direct replacement&apos;s one-proposition-for-one-sentence forced style by permitting the combination of individual information units (of comparable complexity to our own) into compound sentences intersvased with rhetorical connectives. They were, however, limited to extending sentences only at their ends, while our attachment process can add units at any grammatically licit position ahead of the point of speech. Furthermore they ao not yet express combination criteria as explicit, separable rules. Gabriel&apos;s program produced polished written texts through the use of critics and repeated editing. It maintained a very similar model to our own of how a text&apos;s structure can be elaborated, and produced texts of quite high fluency. We differ from Gabriel in trying to achieve fluency in a single online pass in the manner of a person talking off the top of his head; this requires us to put much more of the responsibility for fluency in the pre-linguistic text planner, which is undoubtedly subject to limitations. It is our belief that, for script-like domains, online text generation suffices. This method, in fact, provides us with an interesting diagnostic to test our theory of style: namely, that stylistic rules are meaning-preserving, and do not change the goals or intentions of the speaker. Stylistic rules are to be distinguished from those syntactic rules of grammar which affect the semantic interpretation of a syntactic expression. A non-restrictive relative, for example, is a particular stylistic construction that adds no meaning-delimiting predication to the denotation of the NP. Use of a restrictive relative, on the other hand, is not a matter of style, but of interpretation; &amp;quot;the man who owns a donkey&amp;quot; is not a stylistic variant of the proposition &amp;quot;The man owns a donkey.&amp;quot; In other words, the stylistic component has no reference to intentions, goals, focus, etc. 192 These are the concerns of the planner, and are expressed in its choices of information units and their description (cf. Mann and Moore [1983] for a discussion of similar concerns). 6. Status and Future Work: Computational Models of Text Planning At the time this is being written, the core data structures and interpreters of the program have been implemented and debugged, along with the set of attachment-points and stylistic rules, which are necessary to reproduce the paragraphs. The stylistic planner is completely integrated with the language generation program and has produced texts for scene descriptions (McDonald and Conklin (forthcoming)), narrative summaries (Cook, Lehnert, McDonald, [1984]), and two of the three paragraphs shown in Figure 1. Currently we are shifting domains to generate newspaper articles, in the style of the New York Times. We have only a single style worked out in detail, but we would like to handle styles involving alternative lexical choices, as well. Ultimately what is most exciting to us is the opportunity that we now have to use this framework to develop precise hypotheses about the nature of the &amp;quot;planning unit&amp;quot; in human language generation. This has been an important question in psycholinguistic research as well (Garrett (1982]). This continues our ongoing line of research on the psychological consequences of our computational analysis of generation. The following are a few of the questions that must be addressed in the research on planning. o What is the size of the planning units at various stages; o What is the vocabulary that the units are stated in, e.g. are conceptual and linguistic objects mixed together or are there distinct unit-types at different levels, with some means of cascading between levels; o Should units be modelled as &amp;quot;streams&amp;quot; with conceptual components passing in at one end and text passing out at the other, or are they &amp;quot;quanta&amp;quot; that must be processed in their entirety one after the other; and finally o Can the components of a planning unit be revised after they are selected, or may they only be refined. This appears to relate to similar questions in psycholinguistic research (see Garrett [1982] for review). 7. Acknowledgements</abstract>

An Example 4.1 Underlying representation At the present time we are repmentius the information about a tribe in a frame language kiowa as ARLO [Haase 1984], which is a CottmonLisp implementation of RLL. We have no stock in this representation per se, nor, for that matter, in the specific details of the frames we have built (though we are fairly pleased with both); our system has worked from other representations in the past and we expect to work with still others in the future. Rather, this choice provides us with an expeditious, non-linguistic source for the articles, which has the characteristics we expect of modern representations. Figure 2 shows the toplevel ARLO frame for the Ashanti and one of its subframes. (dekrdt Ashanti (Prototype #&gt;a</context>
