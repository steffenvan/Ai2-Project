It is a challenging task to identify sentiment
polarity of Chinese reviews because the re-
sources for Chinese sentiment analysis are
limited. Instead of leveraging only monolin-
gual Chinese knowledge, this study proposes a
novel approach to leverage reliable English
resources to improve Chinese sentiment
analysis. Rather than simply projecting Eng-
lish resources onto Chinese resources, our ap-
proach first translates Chinese reviews into
English reviews by machine translation ser-
vices, and then identifies the sentiment polar-
ity of English reviews by directly leveraging
English resources. Furthermore, our approach
performs sentiment analysis for both Chinese
reviews and English reviews, and then uses
ensemble methods to combine the individual
analysis results. Experimental results on a
dataset of 886 Chinese product reviews dem-
onstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ap-
proach. The individual analysis of the
translated English reviews outperforms the in-
dividual analysis of the original Chinese re-
views, and the combination of the individual
analysis results further improves the perform-
ance.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999968755102041">
In recent years, sentiment analysis (including sub-
jective/objective analysis, polarity identification,
opinion extraction, etc.) has drawn much attention
in the NLP field. In this study, the objective of sen-
timent analysis is to annotate a given text for polar-
ity orientation (positive/negative). Polarity
orientation identification has many useful applica-
tions, including opinion summarization (Ku et al.,
2006) and sentiment retrieval (Eguchi and
Lavrenko, 2006).
To date, most of the research focuses on English
and a variety of reliable English resources for sen-
timent analysis are available, including polarity
lexicon, contextual valence shifters, etc. However,
the resources for other languages are limited. In
particular, few reliable resources are available for
Chinese sentiment analysis1 and it is not a trivial
task to manually label reliable Chinese sentiment
resources.
Instead of using only the limited Chinese knowl-
edge, this study aims to improve Chinese sentiment
analysis by making full use of bilingual knowledge
in an unsupervised way, including both Chinese
resources and English resources. Generally speak-
ing, there are two unsupervised scenarios for “bor-
rowing” English resources for sentiment analysis
in other languages: one is to generate resources in
a new language by leveraging on the resources
available in English via cross-lingual projections,
and then perform sentiment analysis in the English
language based on the generated resources, which
has been investigated by Mihalcea et al. (2007);
the other is to translate the texts in a new language
into English texts, and then perform sentiment
analysis in the English language, which has not yet
been investigated.
In this study, we first translate Chinese reviews
into English reviews by using machine translation
services, and then identify the sentiment polarity of
English reviews by directly leveraging English
resources. Furthermore, ensemble methods are
employed to combine the individual analysis re-
sults in each language (i.e. Chinese and English) in
order to obtain improved results. Given machine
translation services between the selected target
language and English, the proposed approach can
be applied to any other languages as well.
Experiments have been performed on a dataset
of 886 Chinese product reviews. Two commercial

machine translation services (i.e. Google Translate
and Yahoo Babel Fish) and a baseline dictionary-
based system are used for translating Chinese re-
views into English reviews. Experimental results
show that the analysis of English reviews trans-
lated by the commercial translation services out-
performs the analysis of original Chinese reviews.
Moreover, the analysis performance can be further
improved by combining the individual analysis
results in different languages. The results also
demonstrate that our proposed approach is more
effective than the approach that leverages gener-
ated Chinese resources.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows:
Section 2 introduces related work. The proposed
approach is described in detail in Section 3. Sec-
tion 4 shows the experimental results. Lastly we

2 Related Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999345283783784">
Polarity identification can be performed on word
level, sentence level or document level. Related
work for word-level polarity identification includes
(Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997; Kim and
Hovy. 2004; Takamura et al., 2005; Yao et al.
2006; Kaji and Kitsuregawa, 2007), and related
work for sentence-level polarity identification in-
cludes (Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003; Kim and
Hovy. 2004) Word-level or sentence-level senti-
ment analysis is not the focus of this paper.
Generally speaking, document-level polarity
identification methods can be categorized into un-
supervised and supervised.
Unsupervised methods involve deriving a senti-
ment metric for text without training corpus. Tur-
ney (2002) predicates the sentiment orientation of
a review by the average semantic orientation of the
phrases in the review that contain adjectives or
adverbs, which is denoted as the semantic oriented
method. Kim and Hovy (2004) build three models
to assign a sentiment category to a given sentence
by combining the individual sentiments of senti-
ment-bearing words. Hiroshi et al. (2004) use the
technique of deep language analysis for machine
translation to extract sentiment units in text docu-
ments. Kennedy and Inkpen (2006) determine the
sentiment of a customer review by counting posi-
tive and negative terms and taking into account
contextual valence shifters, such as negations and
intensifiers. Devitt and Ahmad (2007) explore a
computable metric of positive or negative polarity
in financial news text.
Supervised methods consider the sentiment
analysis task as a classification task and use la-
beled corpus to train the classifier. Since the work
of Pang et al. (2002), various classification models
and linguistic features have been proposed to im-
prove the classification performance (Pang and Lee,
2004; Mullen and Collier, 2004; Wilson et al.,
2005a; Read, 2005). Most recently, McDonald et al.
(2007) investigate a structured model for jointly
classifying the sentiment of text at varying levels
of granularity. Blitzer et al. (2007) investigate do-
main adaptation for sentiment classifiers, focusing
on online reviews for different types of products.
Andreevskaia and Bergler (2008) present a new
system consisting of the ensemble of a corpus-
based classifier and a lexicon-based classifier with
precision-based vote weighting.
Research work focusing on Chinese sentiment
analysis includes (Tsou et al., 2005; Ye et al., 2006;
Li and Sun, 2007; Wang et al., 2007). Such work
represents heuristic extensions of the unsupervised
or supervised methods for English sentiment
analysis.
To date, the most closely related work is Mihal-
cea et al. (2007), which explores cross-lingual pro-
jections to generate subjectivity analysis resources
in Romanian by leveraging on the tools and re-
sources available in English. They have investi-
gated two approaches: a lexicon-based approach
based on Romanian subjectivity lexicon translated
from English lexicon, and a corpus-based approach
based on Romanian subjectivity-annotated corpora
obtained via cross-lingual projections. In this study,
we focus on unsupervised sentiment polarity iden-
tification and we only investigate the lexicon-based
approach in the experiments.
Other related work includes subjective/objective
analysis (Hatzivassiloglon and Wiebe, 2000; Riloff
and Wiebe, 2003) and opinion mining and summa-
rization (Liu et al., 2005; Popescu and Etzioni.
2005; Choi et al., 2006; Ku et al., 2006; Titov and
McDonald, 2008).

for sentiment analysis are limited or unreliable.
This study focuses on unsupervised polarity identi-
fication of Chinese product reviews by using both
the rich English knowledge and the limited Chi-
nese knowledge.
The framework of our approach is illustrated in
Figure 1. A Chinese review is translated into the
corresponding English review using machine trans-
lation services, and then the Chinese review and
the English review are analyzed based on Chinese
resources and English resources, respectively. The
analysis results are then combined to obtain more
accurate results under the assumption that the indi-
vidual sentiment analysis can complement each
other. Note that in the framework, different ma-
chine translation services can be used to obtain
different English reviews, and the analysis of Eng-
lish reviews translated by a specific machine trans-
lation service is conducted separately. For
simplicity, we consider the English reviews trans-
lated by different machine translation services as
reviews in different languages, despite the fact that
in essence, they are still in English.

Formally, give a review rev0 in the target lan-
guage (i.e. Chinese), the corresponding review revi
in the ith language is obtained by using a transla-
tion function: revi =f iTrans(rev0), where 1≤i≤p and
p is the total number of machine translation ser-
vices. For each review revk in the kth language
(0≤k≤p), we employ the semantic oriented ap-
proach to assign a semantic orientation value
f kSO(revk) to the review, and the polarity orientation
of the review can be simply predicated based on
the value by using a threshold. Given a set of se-
mantic orientation values FSO={f kSO(revk)  |0≤k≤p},
the ensemble methods aim to derive a new seman-
tic orientation value f Ensemble rev
( 0 ) based on the
SO
values in FSO, which can be used to better classify
the review as positive or negative.
The steps of review translation, individual se-
mantic orientation value computation and ensem-
ble combination are described in details in the next
sections, respectively.

3.2 Review Translation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999969966666667">
Translation of a Chinese review into an English
review is the first step of the proposed approach.
Manual translation is time-consuming and labor-
intensive, and it is not feasible to manually trans-
late a large amount of Chinese product reviews in
real applications. Fortunately, machine translation
techniques have been well developed in the NLP
field, though the translation performance is far
from satisfactory. A few commercial machine
translation services can be publicly accessed. In
this study, the following two commercial machine
translation services and one baseline system are
used to translate Chinese reviews into English re-
views.
Google Translate 2 (GoogleTrans): Google
Translate is one of the state-of-the-art commercial
machine translation systems used today. Google
Translate applies statistical learning techniques to
build a translation model based on both monolin-
gual text in the target language and aligned text
consisting of examples of human translations be-
tween the languages.
Yahoo Babel Fish 3 (YahooTrans): Different
from Google Translate, Yaho Babel Fish uses
SYSTRAN’s rule-based translation engine.
SYSTRAN was one of the earliest developers of
machine translation software. SYSTRAN applies
complex sets of specific rules defined by linguists
to analyze and then transfer the grammatical struc-
ture of the source language into the target language.

dictionary. Each term in a Chinese review is trans-
lated by the first corresponding term in the Chi-
nese-to-English dictionary, without any other
processing steps. In this study, we use the
LDC_CE_DIC2.04 constructed by LDC as the dic-
tionary for translation, which contains 128366
Chinese terms and their corresponding English
terms.
The Chinese-to-English translation perform-
ances of the two commercial systems are deemed
much better than the weak baseline system. Google
Translate has achieved very good results on the
Chinese-to-English translation tracks of NIST open
machine translation test (MT)5 and it ranks the first
on most tracks. In the Chinese-to-English task of
MT2005, the BLEU-4 score of Google Translate is
0.3531, and the BLEU-4 score of SYSTRAN is
0.1471. We can deduce that Google Translate is
better than Yahoo Babel Fish, without considering
the recent improvements of the two systems.
Here are two running example of Chinese re-
views and the translated English reviews (Human-
Trans refers to human translation):

In the above algorithm, PosValue and Neg-
Value are the polarity values for positive words
and negative words respectively. We empirically
set PosValue=1 and NegValue= –2 because nega-
tive words usually contribute more to the overall
semantic orientation of the review than positive
words, according to our empirical analysis. p&gt;1
aims to intensify the polarity value and we simply
set p=2. q is the parameter controlling the window
size within which the negation terms and intensi-
fier terms have influence on the polarity words and
here q is set to 2 words. Note that the above pa-
rameters are tuned only for Chinese sentiment
analysis, and they are used for sentiment analysis
in the English language without further tuning. The
tokenization of Chinese reviews involves Chinese
word segmentation.
Usually, if the semantic orientation value of a
review is less than 0, the review is labeled as nega-
tive, otherwise, the review is labeled as positive.

<bodyText confidence="0.99975855">
In order to assess the performance of the proposed
approach, we collected 1000 product reviews from
a popular Chinese IT product web site-IT16810.
The reviews were posted by users and they focused
on such products as mp3 players, mobile phones,
digital camera and laptop computers. Users usually
selected for each review an icon indicating “pos-
tive” or “negative”. The reviews were first catego-
rized into positive and negative classes according
to the associated icon. The polarity labels for the
reviews were then checked by subjects. Finally, the
dataset contained 886 product reviews with accu-
rate polarity labels. All the 886 reviews were used
as test set.
We used the standard precision, recall and F-
measure to measure the performance of positive
and negative class, respectively, and used the Mac-
roF measure and accuracy metric to measure the
overall performance of the system. The metrics are
defined the same as in general text categorization.

one-to-one translation. Based on the generated
Chinese lexicons, two other individual methods are
investigated in the experiments:
CN2: This method uses only the generated
Chinese Resources to analyze Chinese reviews.
CN3: This method combines the original Chi-
nese lexicons and the generated Chinese lexicons
and uses the extended lexicons to analyze Chinese
reviews.
Table 1 provides the performance values of all
the above individual methods. Seen from the table,
the performances of GoogleEN and YahooEN are
much better than the baseline CN method, and
even the DictEN performs as well as CN. The re-
sults demonstrate that the use of English resources
for sentiment analysis of translated English re-
views is an effective way for Chinese sentiment
analysis. We can also see that the English senti-
ment analysis performance relies positively on the
translation performance, and GoogleEN performs
the best while DictEN performs the worst, which
is consistent with the fact the GoogleTrans is
deemed the best of the three machine translation
systems, while DictTrans is the weakest one.
Furthermore, the CN method outperforms the
CN2 and CN3 methods, and the CN2 method per-
forms the worst, which shows that the generated
Chinese lexicons do not give any contributions to
the performance of Chinese sentiment analysis. We
explain the results by the fact that the term-based
one-to-one translation is inaccurate and the gener-
ated Chinese lexicons are not reliable. Overall, the

4.3 Ensemble Results

<bodyText confidence="0.993820094339623">
In this section, we first use the simple average en-
semble method to combine different individual
analysis results. Table 2 provides the performance
values of the average ensemble results based on
different individual methods.
Seen from Tables 1 and 2, almost all of the av-
erage ensembles outperforms the baseline CN
method and the corresponding individual methods,
which shows that each individual methods have
their own evidences for sentiment analysis, and
thus fusing the evidences together can improve
performance. For the methods of CN+GoogleEN,
CN+YahooEN and CN+DictEN, we can see the
ensemble performance is not positively relying on
the translation performance: CN+YahooEN per-
forms better than CN+GoogleEN, and even
CN+DictEN performs as well as CN+GoogleEN.
The results show that the individual methods in the
ensembles can complement each other, and even
the combination of two weak individual methods
can achieve good performance. However, the Dic-
tEN method is not effective when the ensemble
methods have already included GoogleEN and
YahooEN. Overall, the performances of the en-
semble methods rely on the performances of the
most effective constituent individual methods: the
methods including both GoogleEN and YahooEN
perform much better than other methods, and
CN+GoogleEN+YahooEN performs the best out
of all the methods.
We further show the results of four typical av-
erage ensembles by varying the combination
weights. The combination weights are respectively
specified as λ˙CN+(1-λ)˙GoogleEN, λ˙CN+(1-
λ)˙YahooEN, λ˙CN+(1-λ)˙DictEN,
λ1˙CN+λ2˙GoogleEN+(1-λ1-λ2)˙YahooEN. The results
over the MacroF metric are shown in Figures 3 and
4 respectively. We can see from the figures that
GoogleEN and YahooEN are dominant factors in
the ensemble methods.
We then investigate to use other ensemble meth-
ods introduced in Section 3.4 to combine the CN,
GoogleEN and YahooEN methods. Table 3 gives
the comparison results. The methods of “Weighted
Average1” and “Weighted Average2” are two
weighted average ensembles using the two weigh-
ing schemes, respectively. We can see that all the
ensemble methods outperform the constituent indi-
vidual method, while the two weighted average
ensembles perform the best. The results further
demonstrate the good effectiveness of the ensem-
ble combination of individual analysis results for
Chinese sentiment analysis.

<bodyText confidence="0.999949461538462">
This paper proposes a novel approach to use Eng-
lish sentiment resources for Chinese sentiment
analysis by employing machine translation and
ensemble techniques. Chinese reviews are trans-
lated into English reviews and the analysis results
of both Chinese reviews and English reviews are
combined to improve the overall accuracy. Ex-
perimental results demonstrate the encouraging
performance of the proposed approach.
In future work, more additional English re-
sources will be used to further improve the results.
We will also apply the idea to supervised Chinese
sentiment analysis.

Instead of leveraging only monolingual Chinese knowledge, this study proposes a novel approach to leverage reliable English resources to improve Chinese sentiment analysis. Rather than simply projecting English resources onto Chinese resources, our approach first translates Chinese reviews into English reviews by machine translation services, and then identifies the sentiment polarity of English reviews by directly leveraging English resources. Furthermore, our approach performs sentiment analysis for both Chinese reviews and English reviews, and then uses ensemble methods to combine the individual analysis results. Experimental results on a dataset of 886 Chinese product reviews demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The individual analysis of the translated English reviews outperforms the individual analysis of the original Chinese reviews, and the combination of the individual analysis results further improves the performance.</abstract>

In this study, the objective of sentiment analysis is to annotate a given text for polarity orientation (positive/negative). Polarity orientation identification has many useful applications, including opinion summarization (Ku et al., 2006) and sentiment retrieval (Eguchi and Lavrenko, 2006). To date, most of the research focuses on English and a variety of reliable English resources for sentiment analysis are available, including polarity lexicon, contextual valence shifters, etc. However, the resources for other languages are limited. In particular, few reliable resources are available for Chinese sentiment analysis1 and it is not a trivial task to manually label reliable Chinese sentiment resources.

In this study, the objective of sentiment analysis is to annotate a given text for polarity orientation (positive/negative). Polarity orientation identification has many useful applications, including opinion summarization (Ku et al., 2006) and sentiment retrieval (Eguchi and Lavrenko, 2006). To date, most of the research focuses on English and a variety of reliable English resources for sentiment analysis are available, including polarity lexicon, contextual valence shifters, etc. However, the resources for other languages are limited. In particular, few reliable resources are available for Chinese sentiment analysis1 and it is not a trivial task to manually label reliable Chinese sentiment resources. Instead of using only the limited Chinese knowledge, this study aims to improve Chinese sentiment analysis by making full use of</context>

Generally speaking, there are two unsupervised scenarios for “borrowing” English resources for sentiment analysis in other languages: one is to generate resources in a new language by leveraging on the resources available in English via cross-lingual projections, and then perform sentiment analysis in the English language based on the generated resources, which has been investigated by Mihalcea et al. (2007); the other is to translate the texts in a new language into English texts, and then perform sentiment analysis in the English language, which has not yet been investigated. In this study, we first translate Chinese reviews into English reviews by using machine translation services, and then identify the sentiment polarity of English reviews by directly leveraging English resources. Furthermore, ensemble methods are employed to combine the individual analysis results in each language (i.e. Chinese and English) in order to obtain improved results.

Supervised methods consider the sentiment analysis task as a classification task and use labeled corpus to train the classifier. Since the work of Pang et al. (2002), various classification models and linguistic features have been proposed to improve the classification performance (Pang and Lee, 2004; Mullen and Collier, 2004; Wilson et al., 2005a; Read, 2005).

They have investigated two approaches: a lexicon-based approach based on Romanian subjectivity lexicon translated from English lexicon, and a corpus-based approach based on Romanian subjectivity-annotated corpora obtained via cross-lingual projections. In this study, we focus on unsupervised sentiment polarity identification and we only investigate the lexicon-based approach in the experiments. Other related work includes subjective/objective analysis (Hatzivassiloglon and Wiebe, 2000; Riloff and Wiebe, 2003) and opinion mining and summarization (Liu et al., 2005; Popescu and Etzioni. 2005; Choi et al., 2006; Ku et al., 2006; Titov and McDonald, 2008). 3 The Proposed Approach 3.1 Overview The motivation of our approach is to make full use of bilingual knowledge to improve sentiment analysis in a target language, where the resources 554 for sentiment analysis are limited or unreliable.
