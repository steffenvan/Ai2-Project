1. Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999978615384615">
Interest in the history, theory, and classification of writing systems has never been
higher, and the last decade saw the publication of several worthy books on the sub-
ject, including the formidable one by Daniels and Bright (1996). At the same time,
under the Unicode initiative, there has been solid progress in the definition of and, fi-
nally, the implementation of standards for computer encoding and rendering of scripts
used around the world. However, the implications of this multi-lingual revolution for
computational linguistics beyond the level of word-processing have not been well
explored, and Richard Sproat&apos;s book A Computational Theory of Writing Systems is a
welcome contribution.
In particular, Sproat&apos;s observations and theories are motivated and tested by years
of work at AT&amp;T on text-to-speech systems. This is not the first or the last time that
the rigor of computational application, and the massive practical testing that it allows,
will come back to shape theory.

2. Derivational geometry
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9983988">
Sproat provides very little in the way of an introduction to writing systems; after
pointing the reader to reliable sources, he jumps boldly into his model of reading
devices. The geometry of his model is traditional derivational phonology, involving a
mapping through various levels from an underlying representation U to the surface
phonology. Sproat makes two major claims:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9993235">
1. Consistency: Every orthography corresponds to a single
Orthographically Relevant Level (ORL) in the derivation; and
2. Regularity: MORL-,r, the mapping from the ORL to F, the spelling itself,
is regular.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999535333333333">
In the current academic world, derivational approaches to phonology are out of
fashion, overshadowed by Optimality Theory (Prince and Smolensky 1993) and other
mono-stratal models. The Two-Level finite-state model of computational morphology
(Koskenniemi 1983) also eschews derivation. Nevertheless, a great deal of computa-
tional phonology and morphology continues to be done with derivational cascades of
rewrite rules, which Johnson (1972) and Kaplan and Kay (1994) showed to be only

finite-state in power. Computational linguists from this tradition have challenged OT
(Karttunen 1998; Gerdemann and van Noord 2000), assuming that as long as linguists
stay within finite-state power, they can construct their grammars flatly or derivation-
ally as they find most convenient and perspicuous.
The interesting contribution of Sproat to this ongoing debate is his argument that
the derivation has explanatory power, modeling &amp;quot;orthographical depth.&amp;quot; In this model,
English orthography reflects a fairly deep ORL, Russian a shallower one, Belarusian a
level slightly shallower than Russian, Spanish quite shallow, and so on.
Sproat&apos;s claim that his derivations are regular is testable and potentially disprov-
able; he is forthright in discussing challenges and apparent counterexamples. The sec-
ond claim, that an orthography always represents a consistent level of representation,
and not sometimes one level and sometimes another, is a stronger claim, especially
given the messy history of borrowing and adapting scripts. Scripts, as Sproat himself
points out, are contingent &amp;quot;artifacts&amp;quot; or technologies, not something inherently human
like phonology. He argues credibly, however, that a viable everyday writing system
must bear a &amp;quot;sensible relationship&amp;quot; to the language it represents, that we can expect
a natural pressure in the direction of consistency.

3. Derivational breakdown
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9837102">
Sproat&apos;s MORL---,r rules are divided into two main subgroups:_MEncode, which are (mor-
pho)phonological mappings, and Mspeu, which are &amp;quot;autonomous spelling rules&amp;quot; or
rules reflecting the conventions of the orthography itself. As the rules are regular,
they can simply be composed together, and the result can be encoded as a finite-state
transducer and applied bidirectionally.
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.696601">
MORL--,r = MEncode 0 MSpell
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.997879428571428">
This distinction is easy to defend. Mspen covers phenomena such as the conventions for
representing phonologically long vowels in Dutch orthography, and parallel examples
in other orthographies are easy to find.
Sproat then makes another, less-obvious, distinction, splitting up Mspen, so that
Mspen, is a mapping, encoded as a finite-state transducer, but Ms pe..,onst,.. is encoded
as a regular-language filter. Again, the two subsystems are regular and are composed
together.
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.726581">
MSpell = MSpelcup o Id(Mspell)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.994901285714286">
As composition is defined only for transducers, the composition must technically in-
volve the identity relation on the filter as shown.
The examples of Msvell nstrain involve alternate representations that appear in com-
plementary distribution in the surface orthography. In Malagasy, the vowel /i/ is
represented as either (i) or (y), with (i) occurring only in nonfinal position and (y)
occurring only at the end of words. If M
—Encode contains the rule

(i) I (y)
that is, vowel /i/ is realized as either orthographical (i) or as (y), then MS,)ell

would include the following regular filter to constrain the variants to appear only in
appropriate contexts.
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.915424">
-4(E*(i) #) I (E*(y) -#)]

Grammars that overgenerate and then filter in this way have an obvious OT flavor.
However, while this approach would definitely seem to work, it is difficult to see how
it differs substantially from the following two mapping rules.
(i)
Here the phoneme /i/ is first mapped to (y) at the end of words, and elsewhere, any
leftover /i/ is simply mapped to (i). If orthographical (y) and (i) are excluded from
the domain, then the following equivalence holds.
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.998466">
[E* ((y) I (i)) E*10 j (i) I (y) o —RE* (i) #) I (E* (y)
(i)) ° (Y) # ° (i)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999366">
The filter component Ms, ell constrain is also invoked for handling the alternation of Greek
nonfinal a vs. final c, and for the contextual variant shapes of Arabic (what Unicode
calls the character vs. glyph distinction). Again, it is difficult to see why these same
phenomena could not be handled with mappings or transducers rather than filters,
according to the taste and convenience of the linguist.

4. Planar regular language
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999982">
Sproat expands the normal notion of regular language, consisting of strings of lin-
early concatenated symbols, to planar regular languages, which allow a richer set of
concatenation operations, including left concatenation (-0, right concatenation (&lt;—),
downwards concatenation (1), upwards concatenation (T), and surrounding concate-
nation (0). Illustrated on Chinese, this notation allows for the grouping of semantic
radicals and (semi-reliable) phonetic elements into traditional Chinese morphograms.
The same mechanism is applied, even more successfully, to Korean Hankul (Hangul),
where letter units are arranged into syllable-sized glyphs, and to Devanagari and
Pahawh Hmong. Planar regular expressions are therefore the mechanism proposed
for notating the relative placement of glyphs in all &amp;quot;Small Linguistic Units,&amp;quot; where
variation from the macroscopic order of the script is possible.

5. Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998898125">
Any theory of writing systems takes on a huge task, ultimately beyond the ability of
any single human being. Sproat&apos;s references are intimidatingly wide, and his exam-
ples and experiments include Chinese, Korean, English, Russian, Belarusian, Croatian,
Mayan, Manx Gaelic, Egyptian Hieroglyphics, Syriac, Malagasy, and others. He ap-
plies his theory to classification, adaption of writing systems, spelling reform, and
the psycholinguistics of reading. Yet he&apos;s repeatedly candid about the challenges to
and limitations of his theory (e.g., calligraphy is beyond the pale), and he is to be
commended for pointing out the areas needing further research and confirmation.
Individual readers will of course want to see the theory tested on their own favorite
writing systems; I, for one, wanted to see how the model might apply to Arabic
orthography, and how the model might shed light on the debates about rival proposed
orthographies in the field, for example, for Bantu languages. Critics will want to test
the claims of Regularity on reduplicating languages, and the claims of Consistency
against the amount of ad hoc &amp;quot;lexical marking&amp;quot; needed to support it. But Sproat has
laid out a testable theory, and in the best scientific spirit he has even provided listings
of lexicons and derivation rules for English, contrasting a deep ORL solution a la

Chomsky and Halle (1968) with a shallower solution. To complete the picture, the
AT&amp;T finite-state libraries and a set of programming formalisms called Lextools are
now available on the Web, which further facilitates the reproduction of his English
examples and testing on other languages.&apos;
All in all, this book is commendable, and it is highly recommended for any serious
student of writing systems.
