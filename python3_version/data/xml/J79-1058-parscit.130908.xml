Not all problem solving algorithms should be called intelligent. &amp;quot;Intelligence&amp;quot; denotes a very
distinctive clas3 of problem-solving processes: probably, in the brain, using highly parallel
computation and distributed logic; in some cases, a sequential process that does not use stored
programs. A programmed computer should not be deemed intelligent unless it is functionally
similar to the brain in its use of previous experience.

Though surrounded by fascinating and challenging subjects, too many engineers and scientists
write dull reports and papers. More attention to verbs can help alleviate dullness and can
promote such qualities as vividness, directness, force, and interest. Passive verb forms can be
changed to active; combinations of passive verbs with other lifeless verbs can be. reduced
through subordination and elemination; and nominaLized verbs can be used as true verbs. An
improved approach to technical writing is suggested.

The Terminological Dictionary contains terminology from algebraic linguistics and some
terms from related disciplines, such as structural linguistics, logic, algebra, statistics,
information theory, etc. A certain number of practical catch-words are also included, but
any terms which are contested idiosyncratic, or otherwise problematical are generally omitted.
The dictionary is primarily intended to meet the needs of research work, but it may also be
of use te translators, students, etc. As a relatively new and quickly-developing one, the field
faces the problems of establishing terminology and of determining the extent to which terms
in various languages correspond to one another. On practial grounds the dictionary works
from English terminology, by which entries are alphabetized; the equivalents in French,
German, Russian, and Czech then follow.

The bibliography proper is subdivided into five general topics: formal description -of
language; empirical linguistic problems; surveits and reports; reviews; bibliographies,
translations. It is preceded by a lengthy introducition to the so-called functional generative
description of language as developed by the .Prague group for nearly twenty years. This
description is but one type of stratification desdription, i.e. it works with oirdered planes
which extend fFom meaning on the one hathw to expression on the othen. Functional
generative grammar&apos;s specific nature makes it &apos;suitqd to automatization-&apos;elated applications of
linguistics, such as machine translation and iriformation science (automatic abstracting,
indexing etc. Althougb this work needs much futther development, it is lready of real use
for purely intellectualized texts which are stylistically straightforwai&apos;d and contain relatively
clearly-defined terminology. The system of levels in ftnictional generative description is
informally outlined, with special emphasis being laid on the -semantic plane. (In German)

The machine translation problem has recently been replaced by much narrower goals and
computer processing of language has become part of artificial intelligence (Al), speech
recognition, and structural pattern recognition The narrower goals involve making it possible
for a computer user to employ a near natural-language mode for problem-solving,
information, retrieval, and other applications. Natural computer responses have also been
created and a special term understand has been used to describe the resulting
computer/human dialogues. The purpose of this paper is to survey these recent developments
to make the At literature accessible to researchers mainly interested lh computation on

Resistive loads were applied to the jaw during speech production. Loads were initiated during
the jaw closing movement associated with the production of bilabial stops, creating a situation
in which bilabial closure would be disrupted if motor control were independent of peripheral
feedback. Three subjects were observed during control and experimental conditions. in all
utterances in which a load was appropriutedly introduced, closure of the lips was achieved
and the bilabial stop was adequately produced. To assess the nature of this control,
displacement of the upper lip, lower lip, and jaw, in the inferior-superior dimension, were
recorded alone with EMG from medial pterygoid. anterior temporalis, masseter, and
orbictilaris oris superior muscles. Based on observation of these variables, it appears that the
musules of the lips and jaws are capable of op-line compensatory motor reorganisation.

Segments of speech are extracted from two speech utterances and are computer-analyzed to
yield a statistical measure indicating whether the utterances were said by the same or
different speakers. The analytical studies involved the collection and processing of speech
data from over 250 speakers from which was extracted over 35,000 phonetic-event tokens. A
study of the discriminating power of individual phonetic events, along with a study of
coarticulation effects on these events, was conducted. A unique set of 30 features was
defined for eat.h of the resultant 13 phonetic categories used by the SA IS in carrying out
speaker identification. A weighted Euclidean distance measure was sekcted for measuring
speaker similatity within a phonetic category and a desensitized Fisher discriminant was
incorporated to combine these individual distance measures into an o‘erall measure of
similarity between the speakers of two spoken utterances. A set of likelihood tables, indexed
by similarity measure and the phonetic events used, was derived to determine the probability
that the utterances were uttered by the same individual.

A system is described which analyzes speech samples to identify and extract speaker-
dependent features and to perform a statisticaVcomparison of the features from different
samples. The purpose is to enable law enforcement personnel to compare the recorded voice
of a criminal (e.g., from a bomb threat recording) with recorded voice samples from suspects
to identify the perpetrators of crimes. A minicomputer and associated peripherals accept
analog speech signals for processing and statistical comparison. Specific phonetic events
found to have a high degree of discriminating power are identiried and labeled by the
operator using an interactive graphic display terminal. In the comparison phase each selected
event from the criminal sample is compared with a like event from a suspect sample. The
points of comparison are well defined and yield quantitative results on a repeatable basis.

The program has two sets of inputs: 1) a linguistic description (essentially a phonemic
transcription) of the utterance to be synthesized, 2) a phoneme table containing information
about the category of phoneme, transition duration, average duration, average values of
formant frequencies and their amplitudes which are the target values for the phonemes.
After inputs are fed into the computer the program changes the basic data of the phonemes
according to the allophone rules, which modify the target values of phonemes according to
context. Parameter values are then calculated according to transition rules and intonation
rules. The output of this program is a punched paper tape which is acceptable to the
synthesizer (a computer-simulated parallel-formant synthesizer). Various intelligibility tests
were carried out, the final test including sentences and a story. This last test scored an
average of 97% words correctly recognized by 33 participants.

When we remove all limitations on the input, then what we require of a text-to-speech
system is no less than a cognitive model for reading aloud. Text input is analyzed into an
abstract linguistic specification irom which a surface phonetic realization is generated. Word
!eve, synthesis is the first step. High frequency words can be recognized as a unit, less
frequent words can be recognized as a sequence of familiar morphemes; a 1.2,000 item
morpheme lexicon and a morphological ,analyzerr does this. If this fails the syStem reverts to
direct letter-to-sound synthesis rules. The next. level of synthesis is the assignment of
morphophonemic and lexical stress and the highest level concerns clause-level phenomena
(surprasegmentals, prosodic features). At this highest level three functions, suggested. by
Halliday, are carried by the stress contour: 1) ideational, 2) interpersonal, 3) discourse.

the occurrence of literary and/or grammatical structures. In. their raw form such counts
cannot always be zssumed to have the properties (e.g. approximate normality,

The procedure for morphosyntactic analysis of medical diagnoses is based on the
identification of terminal morphemes which convey infolmation aboilt part-of-speech class
membership and, in some instances, also information about a semantic category to which the
given word form may belong. The rules for the recognition of productive terminal suffixes
and asiignment of syntactio and or semantic values are represented by a tree-like right—to-left
branching graph whose roots are the terminal characters of input words as they occur in the
running text. The examination of characters proceeds from right-to-left to locate a set.of
defined preterminal characters which constitUte a potential suffix. Advantage is taken of the
fact that semantic values can be assigned to a set of highly productive Greek and Latin
suffixes which OCCUT frequently in mdical languages. The program achieved an accuracy of
98.6% for 300 MEDLINE titles and 99.4% for medical diagnoses.

An augmented phrase structure grammar (APSG) consists of&apos; a collection of phrase structure
rules which are augmented by arbitrary conditions and structure building actions. The data
structure used by APSG is a form of semantic network, consisting of &amp;quot;records&apos; which are
collections of attribute-value pairs. Records represent entities, eithtr physical or abstract, and
such diverse things as vehicles, actions words and verb phrases. There are three kinds of
attributes-. relations, which have as their values pointers to other records; properties, which
have as their values either numbers or character strings; and indicators which have bit string
values and usually serve in a role similar to features in linguistic terminology. The decoding
algorithm is basically a bottom-up, left-to-right, parallel-processing,. syntax-directed compiler.

A set of rules which account for roughly the same sentence types that Burt attempts to
account for in her introduction to transformational syntax (1971) has been Euccessfully
developed and computer tested. In contrast. to Burt&apos;s approach, this grammar does not utilize
the transformational cycle; all conditions on the applicability of and the operation of the
rules are made completely explicit. The rules are simply arranged on the basis of their
functions: ranking; grafting (simplification), agreement, suffixing, and surface-structure
transformations. The only transformations which reorder constituents are the surface-
structural ones. The other transformations serve only to rank constituents or to alter trees.
In formulating the transformations, the primary concern is what logical, stylistic, or
psychological factors (such as perceptual strategy, .short-term memory, etc.) might underlie
them.

Decomposition into the normal form is performed through the syntactic analysis related to
the dependency relations among bunsetsu&apos;s in a sentence and the segmentation of words
within each bunsetsu (In Japanese)

For a subset of Russian, the language of geometry, an algorithm produces a predicate calculus
formula expressing the same meaning as a given sentence. The algorithm is based on a
system of formalised synonymic transformations which translate Russian syntactic structures
into those of the predicate calculus. The dependencies connecting transformations in this
system are discussed, and, taking account of them, the process of applying transformations to
a syntactic representation is arranged. so that the end result--a predicate calculus formula--is
obtained after a minimum of trials. (V refs., in Russian)

A frame can be thought of as a network of nodes and relations. The &amp;quot;top levels&amp;quot; of a frame
are fixed, and represent things that are always true about the supposed situation. The lower
levels have many terminals--&amp;quot;slots&amp;quot; that must be filled by specific instances or data. Each
terminal can specify conditions its assignments must meet. Frames are linked together into
frame systems. Topics discussed include: local and global theories of vision, parallelism,
problem solving, is vision symbolic?, seeing a room, scene analysis, perspective and viewpoint

&amp;quot;representations of representations&amp;quot;), words and meanings, discourse, active vs. passive,

Formal grammars such as stochastic grammars, fuzzy grammars, weighted grammars, etc., are
considered grammars in which a certain .algebraic system is assigned to rewriting rules of
formal grammars. In lattice grammars elements constructed by various parameters can be
given as dimensions of lattices in membership space and the grade of words obtainable by
these elements can be regarded as estimation specified by these parameters. The concept of
L-fuzzy sets (Goguen 1967) is introduced into phrase-structural grammars to formulate lattiEe
grammars. wherein lattiCes are an algebraic syStevn assigned to rewriting rules of formal

J. Hintikka (LIINBL 6: 153) claimed that some sentence types exhibit the logical properties of
finite partially ordered (FPO) quantification. It is, shown that the fragments of English
considered by Hintikka offer no evidence that the fbrmulas of FPO quantification theory are
repoducible as the semantic structures of some English sentences. However, to say that
standard logic is powerful enough for these fragments is not to say that standard logic itself
is adequate. The question of how the logical properties of NL sentences can best be
accounted for within linguistic theory therefore remains open.

The main primitive operation in non-numeric processing, is the search. But we must use
standard von Neumann computers whose main primitive operation is addition. The main
hardwire problem in non-numeric processing; the entire data base cannot be put into primary
memory so that the CPU can search it there. If the secondary memory had same searching
capability only highly relevant information would have to be sent to primary memory. An
alternative to the conventional approach is to search dna with many processors acti.ng
parallel. In designing a non-numeric machine one must consider the design of both software
and hardware because: 1) The operations of the Machtne should be as close as possible., to ihe
operations of the end user. 2) The way the data is stored in the,. machine should be as close
as possible. to the way the user sees it, 3) but the user shouldn&apos;t have to be aware of how the
machine stores the data in its storage structure. Other design considerations are discussed and

Classical material implication is unsuitable for many Al and NL purposes becauses it leads to
the deduction of theorems which are irrelevant in that they are semantically unrelated to the
statements from which they are deduced (how useful is the knowledge that a false statement
implies any statement?). A &amp;quot;fail-safe&amp;quot; heuristic is: &amp;quot;do not assert &apos;A implies B&apos; unless the

Large programs such as the SH I DLU system, are so complex that they are almost impossible
to handle. In order to deal with programs an order of magnitude larger than current
programs we need an interactive programming system which can function as a moderately
stupid, but very patient, assistant which combines the powers of a compiler, and interpreter,
and editor, a debugging system, a documentation system, and a problem solver. The user
should be able to intermix writing a program, editing it, running pieces of it, asking
questions about it, stating new information increasing the store of abstract concepts for
de.icribing it, and debugging, all without switching between systems, writing and loading files,
etc. The system should be based on an explicit modeling of the programming world, as
SHRDLU is based on a model of the BLOCKS world. This project is so complex that it
presents us with the paradox of fighting complexity with complexity. The article is followed

Natural languages and computer languages are suited to quite different kinds of applications.
Formal languages are best where the user knows exactly what the system can do, how to use
it, and instructs it to his own ends. Natural language systems are more appropriate where the
user is uncertain about the contents and use of the system and/or uncertain about the
problem domain. A NL interface would allow the user to start work on a proble a in spite
of these uncertainties and it would provide facilities for learning about the system and the
problem domain. Such system should contain knowledge about the problem domain, the
requests appropriate in it, and the linguistic strategies used to specify them. It should be able
to use this knowledge and information about the context and the user&apos;s intentions to
understand the sentence, including being able to complete and understand partially specified
requests, fuzzy words,, and perhaps ambiguous requests.

Programs can be formally documented through two interlinked models: 1) the program model,
which contains the semantic properties of the different tokens in the programming language,
and 2) the application model, which contains the properties of a set of application concepts
meaningful to the users. Application and programming knowledge are represented in a
semantic network of nodes and directed arcs. Th t program model consists of the basic
concepts of the programming language organized as a tree, roughly corresponding to the
abstract of the language. The application model follows the organization of the program and
program model. Without the application model, the only link between the nodes in the
program and program model and the application would be a meaningful label, i.e. &amp;quot;Invoice&amp;quot;
for a document in the program corresponding to the equivalent business document. The
application model contains whatever additional information we wish to associate with the

and the world of practical programming will persist indefinitely; the era of influential
programming language construction is past, Fortran and Cobol. will retain their dominance;
the existing programming languages will develop slowly, with only weak interaction among
the zi;, the areas of widest, ifilluence from scholarly stuthes on progiamming at large will be
program literature and style, the most important medium of influence being textbooks at the
fairly elementary level; greater interest in empirical studies of nroffarnming may be expected
to develop in the future.

SLPL was designed &apos;s an extension of ALGOL 60, concePts to provide a more versatile
language to e use by undergraduates, primarily in conjunction with courses in list
processing, Al,1 and compiling techniques. SLPL combines the security of compile-time mode
compatibility with the flexibility of run-time mode checking. The degree of the
flexibility/security trade-off is und4er the control of the user. SLPL is designed to encourage
structured propamming; list structures and a number of predefined operators and system
primitives to process these structures are provided. The main C..-oncepts of the language are
outlined and a sample program is given in the appendix.

suggested concerning: program readability: constant declarations, automatic indentation to

A semantic network is used to build representations of simple three-dimensional objects and
scenes of such objects. Scenes can be matched by examinrng the networks describing the two
scenes; the skeleton describes those parts of the compared networks that correspond while
comparison notes (C-NOTE) are attached to the skeleton and describe the nature of the
correspondence. The program can learn to recognize simple configurations by exploiting the
near miss. Examples are given in a carefully constructed training sequence sO that the
machine can learn about an object by exploiting the, similarity between a valid example and
one which is almost a valid example. Some of the Concepts built up so far: house, tent,
arch, table. The program also has the capacity to recognize symmetry along three axes by
generating a copy or the scene description and converting LEFT-OF pointers to RIGHT-OF
pointers, and vice versa, (or ABOVE BELOW IN FRONT OF/BEHIND) and then comparing
!.he original description against the modified copy, If the match it exact,, then the scene is
symmetric along the tested axis. Evan&apos;s analogy program is also discussed.

PR techniques and programs may cil,rently be considered as a bag of tricks, justified by their
experimental results. Formalization and theory have been lagging. Propositions are made for
a formal PR language, similar to the language of logic, which could be used to describe
procisely the PR algorithms. Interpretations of the terms of this language have to be made in
other languages: natural, machine or programming languages. A PR function should ,be
constructive, i.e. find its interpretation in an algorithm or pEogram. A training set is far
from enough to define such a function. Properties of the experimental domain .should guide
the PR specialist. They are examined and discussed, in an effort to find some unity in the
PR techniques.

The best indexing (property) space is one where each entity lies as far away from the others
as possible; in these circumstances the value of an indexing system may be expressible as a
function of the density of the object space; in particulAr, retrieval performance may correlate
inversely with space density. Good discriminator terms must, be those with uneven occurrence
frequency distributions which cause the space to spread out when assigned by decreasing the
similarity between the individual documents. Terms of medium frequency should be used for
content identification directly, without further transformation. Terms with very high
document frequency should be transformed into entities of lower frequency--perhaps by using
them as components of indexing phrases. Terms with very low frequency should be
transformed into entities of higher frequency--perhaps by grouping them into common term
(thesaurus) classes.
