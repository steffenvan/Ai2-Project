The implicit delimiting or narrowing of the domain
of quantification, e.g., in the case of &amp;quot;unselective
quantifiers&amp;quot; such as the adverbs of quantification
always, usually, mostly, etc., is a heavily context-
dependent phenomenon that has much in common
with anaphora, presupposition projection, the dy-
namics of reference time, reference location, etc.,
and other of the context-dependent phenomena
discussed in Partee (1979). While many non-
linguistic factors clearly play a role in such phe-
nomena, there are interesting issues at the inter-
section of discourse processing and sentence gram-
mar, since in addition to context as constructed
at the discourse level, there are subsentential &amp;quot;lo-
cal contexts&amp;quot; which have limited lifespans and are
constrained by aspects of sentence grammar, both
syntactic and semantic.
So for example in the case of anaphora, while
a pronoun can get its value from an entirely
non-linguistic context, if the value of a pronoun
is determined by a linguistic antecedent, there
are grammatical contraints on the possible struc-
tural relations that may hold between antecedent
and pronoun, as illustrated by the familiar &amp;quot;pre-
cede/command&amp;quot; conditions known since the early
work of Ross and Langacker and illustrated in (la-
b) below with respect to the possibility of inter-
preting &amp;quot;some people&amp;quot; as the antecedent of &amp;quot;they&amp;quot;.
(la) Some people complain loudly in the mid-
dle of the night and they make so much noise
upstairs that one can&apos;t sleep.
(lb) They make so much noise upstairs that
one can&apos;t sleep and some people complain
loudly in the middle of the night.
In examples (2a-b) we see a similar restriction
on the possibility of restricting the domain of the
quantifier usually by means of material accessible
in the linguistic context: and the relevant notion
of accessibility turns out to be the same for the
wide range of phenomena mentioned above.
(2a) Henrik likes to travel. He goes to France
in the summer and he usually travels by car.
He goes to England for the spring holidays
and he usually travels by ferry.
(2b) Henrik likes to travel. He usually trav-
els by car and he goes to France in the sum-
mer. He usually travels by ferry and he goes
to England for the spring holidays.
In the discourse (2b), unlike that in (2a), it
is impossible to understand the domain of the
quantifier usually to be limited to the trips to
France and the trips to England on its two occur-
rences, so the discourse ends up sounding contra-
dictory. This constraint on &amp;quot;backwards domain
restriction&amp;quot; is analogous to constraints on back-
wards anaphora.
Similar constraints apply to the local satisfac-
tion of presuppositions by virtue of material that
has its source in the local linguistic context. And
Heim has shown in her work on the presupposi-
tion projection problem that the relevant acces-
sibility constraints are fundamentally semantic in
nature, as can be seen from examples with propo-
sitional attitude verbs (which will be reviewed in
the lecture) where examples with identical syn-
tactic structure behave differently because of dif-
ferent presuppositional relationships among e.g.,
&amp;quot;belief worlds&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;hope worlds&amp;quot;. Of course in
many cases the semantic and syntactic structures
are sufficiently parallel that the constraints can of-
ten be described either way.
The notions of topic and focus appear to be
among the important linguistic notions that play
a role in structuring these &amp;quot;recursive contexts&amp;quot;; re-
cent work by Rooth and unpublished work by Von
Fintel makes progress in relating focus structure to
anaphoric structure more generally.
As Kempson has demonstrated, the same
broad range of inferential processes that play a
role in discourse anaphoric phenomena (e.g., in li-
censing the use of a definite article) also play a role
in the corresponding phenomena when they show

up in local subsentential contexts; so the fact that
aspects of sentence grammar play a crucial role
in defining accessibility relations for &amp;quot;antecedent&amp;quot;
material in this whole family of phenomena does
not mean that the phenomena themselves are to
be described in sentence-grammar terms. One of
the interesting issues, then, is the characterization
of the nature of the interface between the gram-
matical and the extragrammatical mechanisms in-
volved. Work by Sidner and Webber represents
one early line of attack on related problems, and
recent developments in dynamic semantics are an-
other. This lecture will focus more on articulating
the relationships among the different phenomena
that appear to operate under common &amp;quot;accessi-
bility&amp;quot; constraints than on choosing a particular
formal approach to treating them.
