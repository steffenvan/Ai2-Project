Second International Conference on Data Bases

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995930307692308">
As a sequel to the meeting held at Dartmouth Col-
lege in 1979, the Faculty of Informatics of the Univer-
sidad Politecnica de Madrid is organizing the Second
International Conference on Data Bases in the Hu-
manities and Social Sciences to be held in Madrid on
June 16-19, 1980. The aims of the conference are to
provide an opportunity for professional contact and
discussion of a major interdisciplinary question: how
the redefinition of objectives and methods in the hu-
manities and social sciences contributes to the ex-
change of ideas and information among the humani-
ties, social sciences, and computer science.
The papers contributed reflect the range of princi-
ples and methods currently adopted in essentially non-
numerical data bases. Also represented are studies of
pedagogical applications, social implications, and po-
tential changes in these disciplines as a consequence of
their adoption of computer-based technology. Oppor-
tunity will be provided to demonstrate both local and
remote systems on the PDP-11.

The paper discusses the incorporation of richer
semantic structures into the Preference Semantics sys-
tem: they are called pseudo-texts and capture some-
thing of the information expressed in one type of
frame proposed by Minsky (q.v.). However, they are
in a format, and subject to rules of inference, consist-
ent with earlier accounts of this system of language
analysis and understanding. Their use is discussed in
connection with the phenomenon of extended use:
sentences where the semantic preferences are broken.
It is argued that such situations are the norm and not
the exception in normal language use, and that a lan-
guage understanding system must give some general
treatment of them. A notion of sense projection is
proposed, leading on to an alteration of semantic for-
mulas (word sense representations) in the face of
unexpected context by drawing information from the
pseudo texts. A possible implementation is described,
based on a new semantic parser for the Preference
Semantics system, which would cope with extended
use by the methods suggested and answer questions
about the process of analysis itself. It is argued that
this would be a good context in which to place a lan-

The paper discusses the incorporation of richer semantic structures into the Preference Semantics systhey are called capture something of the information expressed in one type of frame proposed by Minsky (q.v.). However, they are in a format, and subject to rules of inference, consistent with earlier accounts of this system of language analysis and understanding. Their use is discussed in with the phenomenon of sentences where the semantic preferences are broken. It is argued that such situations are the norm and not the exception in normal language use, and that a lanunderstanding system must give some of them. A notion of projection proposed, leading on to an alteration of semantic formulas (word sense representations) in the face of unexpected context by drawing information from the pseudo texts. A possible implementation is described, based on a new semantic parser for the Preference Semantics system, which would cope with extended use by the methods suggested and answer questions the process of analysis itself. is argued that would be a good context in which to place a lan- * Editor&apos;s note: The abstracts in this issue are not as &amp;quot;current&amp;quot; as I would like, but, because we did not publish the 1979, there is still much material to get caught up on.</abstract>
