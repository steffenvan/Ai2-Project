This paper describes a novel framework
for interactive question-answering (Q/A)
based on predictive questioning. Gen-
erated off-line from topic representations
of complex scenarios, predictive ques-
tions represent requests for information
that capture the most salient (and diverse)
aspects of a topic. We present experimen-
tal results from large user studies (featur-
ing a fully-implemented interactive Q/A
system named FERRET) that demonstrates

In this paper, we propose a new architecture for
interactive question-answering based on predictive
questioning. We present experimental results from
a currently-implemented interactive Q/A system,
named FERRET, that demonstrates that surprising
performance is achieved by integrating sources of
topic information into the context of a Q/A dialogue.
In interactive Q/A, professional users engage in
extended dialogues with automatic Q/A systems in
order to obtain information relevant to a complex
scenario. Unlike Q/A in isolation, where the per-
formance of a system is evaluated in terms of how
well answers returned by a system meet the specific
information requirements of a single question, the
performance of interactive Q/A systems have tradi-
tionally been evaluated by analyzing aspects of the
dialogue as a whole. Q/A dialogues have been evalu-
ated in terms of (1) efficiency, defined as the number
of questions that the user must pose to find particu-
lar information, (2) effectiveness, defined by the rel-
evance of the answers returned, (3) user satisfaction.
In order to maximize performance in these three
areas, interactive Q/A systems need a predictive di-
alogue architecture that enables them to propose re-
lated questions about the relevant information that
could be returned to a user, given a domain of inter-
est. We argue that interactive Q/A systems depend
on three factors: (1) the effective representation of
the topic of a dialogue, (2) the dynamic recognition
of the structure of the dialogue, and (3) the ability to
return relevant answers to a particular question.
In this paper, we describe results from experi-
ments we conducted with our own interactive Q/A
system, FERRET, under the auspices of the ARDA
AQUAINTI program, involving 8 different dialogue
scenarios and more than 30 users. The results pre-
sented here illustrate the role of predictive question-
ing in enhancing the performance of Q/A interac-
tions.
In the remainder of this paper, we describe a new
architecture for interactive Q/A. Section 2 presents
the functionality of several of FERRET’s modules
and describes the NLP techniques it relies upon. In
Section 3, we present one of the dialogue scenar-
ios and the topic representations we have employed.

action between the user and FERRET, while Sec-

We have found that the quality of interactions pro-
duced by an interactive Q/A system can be greatly
enhanced by predicting the range of questions that
a user might ask in the context of a given topic.
If a large database of topic-relevant questions were
available for a wide variety of topics, the accuracy
of a state-of-the-art Q/A system such as (Harabagiu
et al., 2003) could be enhanced.
In FERRET, our interactive Q/A system, we store
such “predicted” pairs of questions and answers in a
database known as the Question Answer Database
(or QUAB). FERRET uses this large set of topic-
relevant question-and-answer pairs to improve the
interaction with the user by suggesting new ques-
tions. For example, when a user asks a question
like (Q1) (as illustrated in Table 1), FERRET returns
an answer to the question (A1) and proposes (Q2),
(Q3), and (Q4) as suggestions of possible continua-
tions of the dialogue. Users then choose how to con-
tinue the interaction by either (1) ignoring the sug-
gestions made by the system and proposing a differ-
ent question, or by (2) selecting one of the proposed
questions and examining its answer.
Figure 1 illustrates the architecture of FERRET.
The interactions are managed by a dialogue shell,
which processes questions by transforming them
into their corresponding predicate-argument struc-
tures2.

Modules from the FERRET’s dialogue shell inter-
act with modules from the predictive dialogue block.
Central to the predictive dialogue is the topic repre-
sentation for each scenario, which enables the pop-
ulation of a Predictive Dialogue Network (PDN).
The PDN consists of a large set of questions that
were asked or predicted for each topic. It is a net-
work because questions are related by “similarity”
links, which are computed by the Question Simi-
larity module. The topic representation enables an
Information Extraction module based on (Surdeanu
and Harabagiu, 2002) to find topic-relevant infor-
mation in the document collection and to use it as
answers for the QUABs. The questions associated
with each predicted answer are generated from pat-
terns that are related to the extraction patterns used
for identifying topic relevant information. The qual-
ity of the dialog between the user and FERRET de-
pends on the quality of the topic representations and
the coverage of the QUABs.

3 Modeling the Dialogue Topic
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999819924242424">
Our experiments in interactive Q/A were based on
several scenarios that were presented to us as part
of the ARDA Metrics Challenge Dialogue Work-
shop. Figure 2 illustrates one of these scenarios. It
is to be noted that the general background consists
of a list of subject areas, whereas the scenario is a
narration in which several sub-topics are identified
(e.g. production of toxins or exportation of materi-
als). The creation of scenarios for interactive Q/A
requires several different types of domain-specific
knowledge and a level of operational expertise not
available to most system developers. In addition to
identifying a particular domain of interest, scenar-
ios must specify the set of relevant actors, outcomes,
and related topics that are expected to operate within
the domain of interest, the salient associations that
may exist between entities and events in the sce-
nario, and the specific timeframe and location that
bound the scenario in space and time. In addition,
real-world scenarios also need to identify certain op-
erational parameters as well, such as the identity of
the scenario’s sponsor (i.e. the organization spon-
soring the research) and audience (i.e. the organiza-
tion receiving the information), as well as a series of
evidence conditions which specify how much verifi-
cation information must be subject to before it can
be accepted as fact. We assume the set of sub-topics
mentioned in the general background and the sce-
nario can be used together to define a topic structure
that will govern future interactions with the Q/A sys-
tem. In order to model this structure, the topic rep-
resentation that we create considers separate topic
signatures for each sub-topic.
The notion of topic signatures was first introduced
in (Lin and Hovy, 2000). For each subtopic in a sce-
nario, given (a) documents relevant to the sub-topic
and (b) documents not relevant to the subtopic, a sta-
tistical method based on the likelihood ratio is used
to discover a weighted list of the most topic-specific
concepts, known as the topic signature. Later work
by (Harabagiu, 2004) demonstrated that topic sig-
natures can be further enhanced by discovering the
most relevant relations that exist between pairs of
concepts. However, both of these types of topic rep-
resentations are limited by the fact that they require
the identification of topic-relevant documents prior
to the discovery of the topic signatures. In our ex-
periments, we were only presented with a set of doc-
uments relevant to a particular scenario; no further
relevance information was provided for individual
subject areas or sub-topics.
In order to solve the problem of finding relevant
documents for each subtopic, we considered four
different approaches:
Approach 1: All documents in the CNS col-
lection were initially clustered using K-Nearest
Neighbor (KNN) clustering (Dudani, 1976).
Each cluster that contained at least one key-
word that described the sub-topic was deemed
relevant to the topic.
Approach 2: Since individual documents may
contain discourse segments pertaining to differ-
ent sub-topics, we first used TextTiling (Hearst,
1994) to automatically segment all of the doc-
uments in the CNS collection into individual
text tiles. These individual discourse segments
</bodyText>

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999376388059701">
then served as input to the KNN clustering al-
gorithm described in Approach 1.
Approach 3: In this approach, relevant docu-
ments were discovered simultaneously with the
discovery of topic signatures. First, we asso-
ciated a binary seed relation for each each
sub-topic . (Seed relations were created both
by hand and using the method presented in
(Harabagiu, 2004).) Since seed relations are by
definition relevant to a particular subtopic, they
can be used to determine a binary partition of
the document collection into (1) a relevant
set of documents (that is, the documents rel-
evant to relation ) and (2) a set of non-relevant
documents - . Inspired by the method pre-
sented in (Yangarber et al., 2000), a topic sig-
nature (as calculated by (Harabagiu, 2004)) is
then produced for the set of documents in .
For each subtopic defined as part of the di-
alogue scenario, documents relevant to a cor-
responding seed relation are added to iff
the relation meets the density criterion (as
defined in (Yangarber et al., 2000)). If rep-
resents the set of documents where is recog-
nized, then the density criterion can be defined
as: . Once is added to , then
a new topic signature is calculated for . Rela-
tions extracted from the new topic signature can
then be used to determine a new document par-
tition by re-iterating the discovery of the topic
signature and of the documents relevant to each
subtopic.
Approach 4: Approach 4 implements the tech-
nique described in Approach 3, but operates
at the level of discourse segments (or texttiles)
rather than at the level of full documents. As
with Approach 2, segments were produced us-
ing the TextTiling algorithm.
In modeling the dialogue scenarios, we consid-
ered three types of topic-relevant relations: (1)
structural relations, which represent hypernymy
or meronymy relations between topic-relevant con-
cepts, (2) definition relations, which uncover the
characteristic properties of a concept, and (3) ex-
traction relations, which model the most relevant
events or states associated with a sub-topic. Al-
though structural relations and definition relations
are discovered reliably using patterns available from
our Q/A system (Harabagiu et al., 2003), we found
only extraction relations to be useful in determining
the set of documents relevant to a subtopic. Struc-
tural relations were available from concept ontolo-
gies implemented in the Q/A system. The definition
relations were identified by patterns used for pro-
cessing definition questions.
Extraction relations are discovered by processing
documents in order to identify three types of rela-
tions, including: (1) syntactic attachment relations
(including subject-verb, object-verb, and verb-PP
relations), (2) predicate-argument relations, and (3)
salience-based relations that can be used to encode
long-distance dependencies between topic-relevant
concepts. (Salience-based relations are discovered
using a technique first reported in (Harabagiu, 2004)
which approximates a Centering Theory-style ap-
proach (Kameyama, 1997) to the resolution of
coreference.)

words with their (morphological) root form (e.g.
wounded with wound, weapons with weapon), (b)
by replacing lexemes with their subsuming category

by replacing each name with its name class (Egypt

ticular set of documents, the resulting set of re-

Representing topics in terms of relevant concepts
and relations is important for the processing of ques-
tions asked within the context of a given topic. For
interactive Q/A, however, the ideal topic-structured
representation would be in the form of question-
answer pairs (QUABs) that model the individual
segments of the scenario. We have currently cre-
ated two sets of QUABs: a handcrafted set and
an automatically-generated set. For the manually-
created set of QUABs, 4 linguists manually gener-
ated 3210 question-answer pairs for each of the 8
dialogue scenarios considered in our experiments.
In a separate effort, we devised a process for au-
tomatically populating the QUAB for each scenario.
In order to generate question-answer pairs for each
subtopic, we first identified relevant text passages in
the document collection to serve as “answers” and
then generated individual questions that could be an-

Answer Identification: We defined an an-
swer passage as a contiguous sequence of sentences
with a positive answer rank and a passage price
of 4. To select answer passages for each sub-
topic , we calculate an answer rank,
, that sums across the scores of each
relation from the topic signature that is identified in
the same text window. Initially, the text window
is set to one sentence. (If the sentence is part of a
quote, however, the text window is immediately ex-
panded to encompass the entire sentence that con-
tains the quote.) Each passage with is
then considered to be a candidate answer passage.
The text window of each candidate answer passage
is then expanded to include the following sentence.
If the answer rank does not increase with the addi-
tion of the succeeding sentence, then the price (✦) of
the candidate answer passage is incremented by 1,
otherwise it is decremented by 1. The text window
of each candidate answer passage continues to ex-
pand until . Before the ranked list of candidate
answers can be considered by the Question Genera-
tion module, answer passages with a positive price
are stripped of the last sentences.

output of a named entity recognizer and a se-

structuring into predicate-argument frames, (b)
the resolution of reference (addressed in Prob-
lem 1), (c) the recognition of implicit rela-
tions between predications stated in the answer.
Some of these implicit relations are referential,
as is the relation between predicates and
illustrated in Figure 4. A special case of im-
plicit relations are the causal relations. Fig-
ure 5 illustrates an answer where a causal re-
lation exists and is marked by the cue phrase
because. Predicates – like those in Figure 5 –
can be phrasal (like ) or negative (like ).
Causality is established between predicates
and ’ as they are the ones that ultimately de-
termine the selection of the answer. The predi-
cate can be substituted by its nominalization
since of is BW, the same argument is
transferred to . The causality implied by the
answer from Figure 5 has two components: (1)
the effect (i.e. the predicate ) and (2) the re-
sult, which eliminates the semantic effect of the
negative polarity item never by implying the

generated are based on question patterns asso-
ciated with causal relations and therefore allow
different degrees for the specificity of the resul-
tative, i.e obstacle or deterrent.
We generated several questions for each answer
passage. Questions were generated based on pat-
terns that were acquired to model interrogations
using relations between predicates and their argu-
ments. Such interrogations are based on (1) as-
sociations between the answer type (e.g. DATE)
and the question stem (e.g. “when” and (2) the
relation between predicates, question stem and the
words that determine the answer type (Narayanan
and Harabagiu, 2004). In order to obtain these
predicate-argument patterns, we used 30% (approxi-
mately 1500 questions) of the handcrafted question-
answer pairs, selected at random from each of the 8
dialogue scenarios. As Figures 4 and 5 illustrate, we
used patterns based on (a) embedded predicates and
(b) causal or counterfactual predicates.

i.e. by proposing to the user a small set of questions
that tackle the same subject as her question (as illus-
trated in Table 1). The advantage is that the user can
follow-up with one of the pre-processed questions,
that has a correct answer and resides in one of the
QUABs. This enhances the effectiveness of the dia-
logue. It also may impact on the efficiency, i.e. the
number of questions being asked if the QUABs have
good coverage of the subject areas of the scenario.
Moreover, complex questions, that generally are not
processed with high accuracy by current state-of-
the-art Q/A systems, are associated with predictive
questions that represent decompositions based on

similarities between predicates and arguments of the
original question and the predicted questions.
The selection of the questions from the QUABs
that are proposed for each user question is based on
a similarity-metric that ranks the QUAB questions.
To compute the similarity metric, we have experi-
mented with seven different metrics. The first four
metrics were introduced in (Lytinen and Tomuro,
2002).
Similarity Metric 2 is based on the percent of
user question terms that appear in the QUAB
question. It is obtained by finding the intersec-
tion of the terms in the term vectors of the two
questions.
Similarity Metric 3 is based on semantic in-
formation available from WordNet. It involves:
(a) finding the minimum path between Word-
Net concepts. Given two terms and ,
each with and WordNet senses
and . The se-
mantic distance between the terms is
defined by the minimum of all the possible pair-
wise semantic distances between and :

as , where
Similarity Metric 4 is based on the question
type similarity. Instead of using the question
class, determined by its stem, whenever we
could recognize the answer type expected by
the question, we used it for matching. As back-
off only, we used a question type similarity
based on a matrix akin to the one reported in
(Lytinen and Tomuro, 2002)
Similarity Metric 5 is based on question con-
cepts rather than question terms. In order to
translate question terms into concepts, we re-
placed (a) question stems (i.e. a WH-word +
NP construction) with expected answer types
(taken from the answer type hierarchy em-
ployed by FERRET’s Q/A system) and (b)
named entities with corresponding their corre-
sponding classes. Remaining nouns and verbs
were also replaced with their WordNet seman-
tic classes, as well. Each concept was then as-
sociated with a weight: concepts derived from
named entities classes were weighted heavier
than concepts from answer types, which were
in turn weighted heavier than concepts taken
from WordNet clases. Similarity was then com-
puted across “matching” concepts. 5 The resul-
tant similarity score was based on three vari-
ables:
= sum of the weights of all concepts matched
between a user query ( ) and a QUAB query
( )
= sum of the weights of all unmatched con-
cepts in ;
= sum of the weights of all unmatched con-
cepts in ;
The similarity between and was calcu-
lated as , where and
were used as coefficients to penalize the con-
tribution of unmatched concepts in and
respectively. 6
Similarity Metric 6 is based on the fact that the

QUAB questions are clustered based on their
mapping to a vector of important concepts in
the QUAB.The clustering was done using the
K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) method (Dudani,
1976). Instead of measuring the similarity be-
tween the user question and each question in
the QUAB, similarities are computed only be-
tween the user question and the centroid of
each cluster.
Similarity Metric 7 was derived from the re-
sults of Similarity Metrics 5 and 6 above. In
this case, if the QUAB question ( ) that was
deemed to be most similar to a user question
( ) under Similarity Metric 5 is contained
in the cluster of QUAB questions deemed to
be most similar to under Similarity Metric
6, then receives a cluster adjustment score
in order to boost its ranking within its QUAB
cluster. We calculate the cluster adjustment
score as
, where represents the difference
in rank between the centroid of the cluster and
the previous rank of the QUAB question .
In the currently-implemented version of FERRET,
we used Similarity Metric 5 to automatically iden-
tify the set of 10 QUAB questions that were most
similar to a user’s question. These question-and-
answer pairs were then returned to the user – along
with answers from FERRET’s automatic Q/A system
– as potential continuations of the Q/A dialogue. We
used the remaining 6 similarity metrics described in
this section to manually assess the impact of simi-
larity on a Q/A dialogue.

To date, we have used FERRET to produce over 90
Q/A dialogues with human users. Figure 6 illustrates
three turns from a real dialogue from a human user
investigating Iran’s chemical weapons prorgram. As
it can be seen coherence can be established between
the user’s questions and the system’s answers (e.g.
Q3 is related to both A1 and A3) as well as between
the QUABs and the user’s follow-up questions (e.g.
QUAB (1b) is more related to Q2 than either Q1 or
A1). Coherence alone is not sufficient to analyze the
quality of interactions, however.
In order to better understand interactive Q/A dia-
logues, we have conducted three sets of experiments
with human users of FERRET. In these experiments,
users were allotted two hours to interact with Ferret
to gather information requested by a dialogue sce-
nario similar to the one presented in Figure 2. In
Experiment 1 (E1), 8 U.S. Navy Reserve (USNR)
intelligence analysts used FERRET to research 8 dif-
ferent scenarios related to chemical and biological
weapons. Experiment 2 and Experiment 3 consid-
ered several of the same scenarios addressed in E1:
E2 included 24 mixed teams of analysts and novice
users working with 2 scenarios, while E3 featured 4
USNR analysts working with 6 of the original 8 sce-
narios. (Details for each experiment are provided in

We have evaluated FERRET by measuring effi-
ciency, effectiveness, and user satisfaction:
Efficiency FERRET’s QUAB collection enabled
users in our experiments to find more relevant infor-
mation by asking fewer questions. When manually-
created QUABs were available (E1 and E2), users
submitted an average of 12.25 questions each ses-
sion. When no QUABs were available (E3), users
entered a total of 44.5 questions per session. Table 4
lists the number of QUAB question-answer pairs se-
lected by users and the number of user questions en-
tered by users during the 8 scenarios considered in
E1. In E2, freed from the task of writing a research
report, users asked significantly (p 0.05) fewer
questions and selected fewer QUABs than they did
in E1. (See Table 5).
Effectiveness QUAB question-answer pairs also
improved the overall accuracy of the answers re-
turned by FERRET. To measure the effectiveness of
a Q/A dialogue, human annotators were used to per-
form a post-hoc analysis of how relevant the QUAB
pairs returned by FERRET were to each question

entered by a user: each QUAB pair returned was
graded as “relevant” or “irrelevant” to a user ques-
tion in a forced-choice task. Aggregate relevance
scores were used to calculate (1) the percentage of
relevant QUAB pairs returned and (2) the mean re-
ciprocal rank (MRR) for each user question. MRR is
defined as , whree is the lowest rank of
any relevant answer for the user query7. Table 6
describes the performance of FERRET when each of
the 7 similarity measures presented in Section 4 are
used to return QUAB pairs in response to a query.
When only answers from FERRET’s automatic Q/A
system were available to users, only 15.7% of sys-
tem responses were deemed to be relevant to a user’s
query. In contrast, when manually-generated QUAB
pairs were introduced, as high as 84% of the sys-
tem’s responses were deemed to be relevant. The
results listed in Table 6 show that the best metric is
Similarity Metric 5. Thse results suggest that the
selection of relevant questions depends on sophis-
ticated similarity measures that rely on conceptual
hierarchies and semantic recognizers.
We evaluated the quality of each of the four
sets of automatically-generated QUABs in a sim-
ilar fashion. For each question submitted by a
user in E1, E2, and E3, we collected the top 5
QUAB question-answer pairs (as determined by
Similarity Metric 5) that FERRET returned. As with

In our experiments, we were only presented with a set of documents relevant to a particular scenario; no further relevance information was provided for individual subject areas or sub-topics. In order to solve the problem of finding relevant documents for each subtopic, we considered four different approaches: Approach 1: All documents in the CNS collection were initially clustered using K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) clustering (Dudani, 1976). Each cluster that contained at least one keyword that described the sub-topic was deemed relevant to the topic. Approach 2: Since individual documents may contain discourse segments pertaining to different sub-topics, we first used TextTiling (Hearst, 1994) to automatically segment all of the documents in the CNS collection into individual text tiles. These individual discourse segments 207 then served as input to the KNN clustering algorithm described in Approach 1.

If a large database of topic-relevant questions were available for a wide variety of topics, the accuracy of a state-of-the-art Q/A system such as (Harabagiu et al., 2003) could be enhanced. In FERRET, our interactive Q/A system, we store such “predicted” pairs of questions and answers in a database known as the Question Answer Database (or QUAB). FERRET uses this large set of topicrelevant question-and-answer pairs to improve the interaction with the user by suggesting new questions. For example, when a user asks a question like (Q1) (as illustrated in Table 1), FERRET returns an answer to the question (A1) and proposes (Q2), (Q3), and (Q4) as suggestions of possible continuations of the dialogue.

In modeling the dialogue scenarios, we considered three types of topic-relevant relations: (1) structural relations, which represent hypernymy or meronymy relations between topic-relevant concepts, (2) definition relations, which uncover the characteristic properties of a concept, and (3) extraction relations, which model the most relevant events or states associated with a sub-topic. Although structural relations and definition relations are discovered reliably using patterns available from our Q/A system (Harabagiu et al., 2003), we found only extraction relations to be useful in determining the set of documents relevant to a subtopic. Structural relations were available from concept ontologies implemented in the Q/A system. The definition relations were identified by patterns used for processing definition questions. Extraction relations are discovered by processing documents in order to identify three types of relations, including: (1) syntactic attachment relations (including subject-verb, object-verb, and verb-PP relations), (2) predicate-argument relations, and (3) salience-based relations that can be used to en</context>

In order to model this structure, the topic representation that we create considers separate topic signatures for each sub-topic. The notion of topic signatures was first introduced in (Lin and Hovy, 2000). For each subtopic in a scenario, given (a) documents relevant to the sub-topic and (b) documents not relevant to the subtopic, a statistical method based on the likelihood ratio is used to discover a weighted list of the most topic-specific concepts, known as the topic signature. Later work by (Harabagiu, 2004) demonstrated that topic signatures can be further enhanced by discovering the most relevant relations that exist between pairs of concepts. However, both of these types of topic representations are limited by the fact that they require the identification of topic-relevant documents prior to the discovery of the topic signatures.

Modules from the FERRET’s dialogue shell interact with modules from the predictive dialogue block. Central to the predictive dialogue is the topic representation for each scenario, which enables the population of a Predictive Dialogue Network (PDN). The PDN consists of a large set of questions that were asked or predicted for each topic. It is a network because questions are related by “similarity” links, which are computed by the Question Similarity module. The topic representation enables an Information Extraction module based on (Surdeanu and Harabagiu, 2002) to find topic-relevant information in the document collection and to use it as answers for the QUABs. The questions associated with each predicted answer are generated from patterns that are related to the extraction patterns used for identifying topic relevant information. The quality of the dialog between the user and FERRET depends on the quality of the topic representations and the coverage of the QUABs. 3The Center for Non-Proliferation Studies at the Monterrey Institute of International Studies distributes collections of print and online documents on weapons of mass destruction.
