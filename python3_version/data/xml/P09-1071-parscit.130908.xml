This paper describes our system for generating
Chinese aspect expressions. In the system, the
semantics of different aspects is characterized
by specific temporal and conceptual features.
The semantic applicability conditions of each
individual aspect are theoretically represented
by an aspect selection function (ASF). The
generation is realized by evaluating
implemented inquiries which formally define
the ASFs, traversing the grammatical network,
and making aspect selections.

Aspect is one of the most controversial topics
among linguists and philosophers. Unlike the
function of tense, which relates the time of
situation to a deictic center, aspects are different
ways of viewing the states of a situation with
respect to the situation’s internal temporal
constituency (Yang, 2007). This paper describes
our system for generating Chinese aspect
expressions. The aspect forms covered in the
present research were derived from a corpus
analysis. The main task of the aspect research
from a computational perspective is to
implement computationally both the semantic
interpretations and the grammatical realizations
of aspects as formulated in theoretical work. The
theoretical principle of this is, to a large extent,
based on Montague’s intensional logic
(Montague, 1970; Dowty, 1979; Bestougeff and
Ligozat, 1992, Portner and Partee, 2002). It is
held that the goal of semantics is to present the
truth conditions for each well formed sentence.
In previous studies there are some fruitful
experiments on computationally processing
temporal information in Chinese, e.g. Lee and
Hsu’s Chinese to English machine translation

system (1990), Li, Wong, and Yuan’s temporal
information-extraction system (2001), Xue’s
machine learning system (2008), and Xue, Zhong
&amp; Chen’s tense annotation system (2008).
However, a systematic investigation, including
the implementation of the semantics of aspects,
has rarely been carried out before and is one of
the main contributions of the present research.
Aspects are determined by both situation types,
which build specific situation structures, and
particular viewpoints that construct specific
temporal relations between the viewing points
and the internal temporal constituencies of
situations. These two kinds of factors, which
influence aspect selections, can be characterized
by aspectual features. This makes it possible for
us to use a function which takes relevant time
points and concepts as its parameters and
“calculates” the truth value of the semantic
applicability conditions of a specific aspect in
order to make a corresponding aspect selection in
language generation. We term this function the
Aspect Selection Function (ASF). The ASFs are
used for the theoretical descriptions of the
aspects and, at the same time, they are the basis
for our computational implementation of the
semantics of the aspects.
Our system has been implemented as a
grammar for the KPML multilingual generator
(Bateman, 1997a, 1997b) which is equipped with
a large systemic grammar and all the technical
components required in generation, including an
input component, a traversal component, a
realization component, and so on. This brings
direct benefits for us in both theoretical and
implementational respects since we could then
focus on the linguistic treatment of the Chinese
aspects.
The paper is organized into five sections. In
the next three sections the semantic features of

aspects will be given. Finally in Section 5, we
make a brief conclusion.
2 The semantic features of the aspects
One of the methods adopted in aspect studies is
to use semantic features to characterize different
situations (cf. Comrie, 1976; Smith, 1991, 1997;
Olsen, 1997; and Dai, 1997). This is also taken
as the basic principle in the present research. For
the purpose of characterizing the semantics of an
aspect, the features needed are not only those
reflecting the properties of situation types, but
also those reflecting the temporal relations
between the viewing points and the internal
temporal constituencies of the situations. When
we establish a system of aspects, we say that the
features used are necessary and sufficient if
different aspects included can be distinguished
from each other by means of these features.
Consequently, the more aspect expressions are
involved, the more aspectual features are needed.
Two kinds of aspectual features are proposed
in the present research. One kind of aspectual
feature can be directly represented in terms of
relations holding over time points. These are
termed features of temporal relations (FTR). For
example, the feature durative, which is used for
situations extended in time, can be represented
with the temporal relation t1&lt;t2 where t1 and t2
denote two time points bounding the situation.
Similarly, the feature punctual (momentary),
which is used for situations theoretically taking a
moment, can be formally represented by the
temporal relation t1=t2.
There is then a further kind of aspectual
feature which cannot be directly represented by
temporal relations, although they may also
concern temporal properties of situations. This
kind of feature can only be represented by
parameters which serve to provide a conceptual
classification of the situations involved; therefore,
they are termed features of conceptual type
(FCP), such as dynamic and repeatable.
In addition, there is a special kind of aspectual
feature which reflects qualitative properties of
temporal relations: far-precede and shortly-
precede. These two features indicate qualitative
distances between time points; the former means
that one time point is linearly much before
another time point on the time axis; the latter
means that one time point is only a little before
another time point. In specific context, these
kinds of qualitative properties are reflected
relatively in comparative or inclusive relations
between temporal and spatial scopes of situations.
Aspectual features are the basic elements to be
used for aspect descriptions. The range of
aspectual features is not held to be cross-
linguistically valid. In the present research, the
following aspectual features are used to describe
Chinese aspects. The states of relational type
formed by the verbs like k (shi, be), �h(y6u,
have), Vfld6ngyu, equal) etc. are associated
with relational processes (Halliday, 1985) and
therefore not included in the features listed. In
the following feature definitions, ti refers to the
initial time of a situation, tt the terminating time
of a situation, and tr the reference time of an
aspect. In the present research, we define the
reference time as the time from which the state
of a situation with respect to the situation’s
internal temporal constituency is contextually
examined.

(1) durative (FTR): describes situations
which take time. It is represented by the
temporal relation ti&lt;tt.
(2) punctual (FTR): describes situations
which theoretically take only a moment
of time. It is formally represented by the
temporal relation ti=tt.
(3) realized (FTR): describes situations
which have occurred, have existed, or
have shown the property of reality by
some specific time. It is represented by
the temporal relation tt≤tr.
(4) dynamic-state (FCP): describes a
durative changing situation.
(5) stative-state (FCP): describes a durative
unchanging situation associated with the
activity meaning of an activity verb.
(6) change-of-state (FCP): indicates either
the inception or termination of a
situation.
(7) event (FCP): describes a dynamic
situation viewed as a complete whole
(Comrie, 1976, p.13) and is aspectually
associated with the occurrence, taking
place, or completion of the situation.
(8) repeatable (FCP): describes situations
which can occur repeatedly.
(9) specific (FCP): when a time point is
specific, it has a particular position on
the time axis which can be determined
from context.

unspecific, its position on the time axis
is unknown.

<bodyText confidence="0.998929947368421">
Concerning the opening and closure of a time
interval at its end points, two principles are
proposed by the present research. The opening
and closure of a time interval at its end points
can be determined according to the following
principles, which we term exclusiveness
principles (ELPs):
ELP (1) For the initial time ti: when the
initial time ti of the situation is specific,
then the time interval at the initial time ti
is considered closed; when the initial
time ti of the situation is unspecific, then
the time interval at the initial time ti is
considered open.
ELP (2) For the terminating time tt:
when the situation does not hold at the
terminating time tt, the time interval is
considered closed at the terminating
time; when the situation still holds at the
terminating time tt, the time interval is
considered open at the terminating time.
As far as the temporal structures of
aspects are concerned, there is an
extreme case: when the terminating time
tt precedes the reference time tr, in which
case the time period of the situation is
definitely closed at the terminating time
tt.
The semantic feature telicity indicating that the
situation referred to has an internal end point (cf.
Vendler, 1967; Comrie, 1976) is not used in the
present research for the Chinese aspect
descriptions. The feature telicity is not an
effective feature for characterizing Chinese
aspects from a language generation point of
view because there is no single aspect of the
present aspect system that absolutely requires
that the situations expressed be telic or atelic.

<bodyText confidence="0.999963028571428">
Specific features of temporal relations and the
conceptual features together build semantic
applicability conditions for each individual
aspect. The semantic applicability conditions are
represented by the aspect selection function
(ASF) of the aspect. The ASF of a specific aspect
assumed by the present research is, therefore,
principally composed of two sets of predicates:
one set of predicates for testing temporal
relations (Allen, 1984; Yang &amp; Bateman, 2002),
another for testing the values, i.e. conceptual
features, of parameters associated with the aspect.
All the predicates are connected with
conjunctions at the top level. At the lower levels,
the logical relations among the predicates can be
a conjunction and, a disjunction or and a
negation not. To evaluate the truth condition of
the ASF for a specific aspect, the values of all
relevant temporal relations and parameters are
evaluated. When all the predicates are true, i.e.,
all of the required conditions are met, the value
of the ASF is true; otherwise, the value of the
ASF is false.
In the predicates of the ASFs, there are two
kinds of parameters: temporal parameters
associated with the time points involved in the
temporal structures of the aspects and conceptual
parameters associated with the specific
conceptual features of the aspects. The
conceptual features will be taken as values of the
corresponding parameters and represented by
EQUAL(p, c), in which ‘p’ refers to a parameter
and ‘c’ refers to the conceptual feature associated
with that parameter. Some of the parameters are
given as follows:

parameter indicates whether the
situation has the feature change-of-state.

indicates whether the situation is
repeatable.

indicates whether the time point t is
specific or unspecific.

(shortly-precede) time point t2.

parameter indicates whether the time
point t, which is one of the end points of
a time interval, has the feature excluded
or included.

<bodyText confidence="0.996290847826087">
We now take the unmarked-realized (URE)
aspect V+了 (V+le) as an example to illustrate
the structure of the ASF. The URE aspect V+了
(V+le) is one of the perfective aspects, serving to
indicate that the occurrence, development, or
change of the situation is realized (not
necessarily complete) by some specific time. The
temporal structure of the aspect is shown in
Figure 1.
The temporal structure in Figure 1 is explained
as follows: The situations expressed in the URE
aspect can be either punctual, i.e. ti=tt, or
durative, i.e. ti&lt;tt. The time interval of the
situation defined by “{ti, tt}” is either closed or
open at its ends. The feature realized is
represented by specifying that the terminating
time equals the reference time, i.e. tt=tr, rather
than that the terminating time either equals or
precedes the reference time, i.e. tt≤tr ― the latter
is the general condition for all perfective aspects.
In Figure 1, the case of a punctual situation, i.e.
ti=tt, is theoretically taken as a very short time
period and not explicitly represented. RTtr
indicates that the reference time tr is a specific
time point.
In addition to the temporal relations explained
above, the URE aspect V+ 了 (V+le) has
prominently three characteristics associated with
the situation properties. When the URE aspect
V+了(V+le) expresses a durative situation, the
situation can be either a state or an event. When
the process is of relational type, a change of state
should be emphasized. When a change of state is
involved in the situation, the URE aspect V+了
(V+le) focuses on the realization of the event,
rather than the resultative state, unless current
relevance is indicated in context. These three
characteristics can be respectively represented by
corresponding conceptual features associated
with the parameters SAPp, CBp, and PROCESS
involved in the predicates of the ASF of the URE
aspect as shown in Figure 2. The ASFs are used
for the purpose of theoretical descriptions, but
also, as we shall see in the next section, give the
basis for the implementation of the semantics of
the aspects.

The present research uses the multilingual
generator KPML as its implementation platform

as its theoretical basis. Fourteen primary simple
aspects, and twenty-six complex aspects are
organized into a hierarchical system network. In
a system network, grammatical units are
constructed by corresponding traversals of that
network. Each path through the network from the
root to an end node corresponds to a specific

leading to the creation of that expression. The
system is guided by the joint actions of the
inquiries and choosers of the system (Fawcett,
1987; Matthiessen and Bateman, 1991; Bateman,
2000; Yang &amp; Bateman, 2002). “A chooser is
straightforwardly represented as a ‘decision tree’
with a particular kind of inquiry, called a
branching inquiry, forming the decision points”
(Bateman 1997c, p.20). Inquiries are responsible
for finding the answers required by choosers by
accessing semantic information represented in
input specifications, written in the form of the
Sentence Plan Language (SPL) (Kasper, 1989;
Bateman, 1997a), and in the knowledge base of
the system.
The semantics of an aspect associated with a
sentence to be generated is represented in the
input specification. The time points involved in
the temporal structure of the aspect to be
generated, i.e. the initial time, the terminating
time, and the reference time(s), are presented
with specific time values in the input
specification. The speaking time has a default
value corresponding to the present moment. All
the parameters characterizing the conceptual
features of the aspect to be generated are also
included in the input specification.
The implemented inquiries, written in LISP,
play a crucial role in the generation of the aspect
expressions. The implemented inquiries
associated with different types of aspects
formally define the semantic applicability
conditions represented by the ASFs of the
aspects. Each implemented inquiry has a set of
parameters with specific values to represent
temporal relations and conceptual features of a
specific aspect. The inquiry is composed of a set
of predicates which will have the value T when
the conditions defined are satisfied. The truth
condition of an inquiry will be met only when all
the predicates involved have the value T. Hence,
evaluating an implemented inquiry refers to the
process of testing the truth conditions of all the
predicates involved in the inquiry according to
at-past
the semantic information represented in the
corresponding input specification.
In the implemented inquiries, two basic
predicates PRECEDE(t1, t2) and SAME(t1, t2) are
used to test temporal relations involved in the
semantic applicability conditions of different
aspects. In the generation, the parameters t1 and
t2, are replaced with the values of the initial time
ti, the terminating time tt, or the reference time tr,
which are given in the input specifications.
Logically, given a specific context, the
precedence of two points can be determined in
terms of concepts PAST, PRESENT, and
FUTURE with reference to a relative deictic
center. To evaluate the precedence between two
time points, nine different time values are
defined on the time axis as shown in Figure 3. In
Figure 3, the values at-past-present, at-present,
and at-future-present correspond to three time
points. The other six values correspond to
specific intervals on the time axis. The time
points within each interval are given a specific
time value, as shown below, where “-oo” stands
for the infinite past, and “+oo” stands for the
infinite future:

<equation confidence="0.984450833333333">

The nine qualitative time values defined above
build a calculating system for time comparison in
the present research. To generate a specific
aspect, i.e., from semantics to the surface
expression of the aspect, what we need to do is to
distribute each time point involved in the
temporal structure of the aspect with one of the
qualitative time values and to establish
appropriate temporal relations between them as
to be illustrated in the next section.

4.2 An example of generating the aspect
expressions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999990588785047">
In this section we illustrate the generation
process with an example. We focus on the
generation of the aspect expressions and ignore
the generation process for the other sentence
constituents. Because of the limitation of input
associated with relevant files in the
implementation, we use numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 to
refer to the four tones of Chinese characters in all
the realization statements. For instance, wang1,
wang2, wang3, and wang4 refer to wāng, wáng,
wăng, and wàng respectively. The neutral tone is
not marked by numbers.
In the present case, the semantics represented
in the input specification is set for the situation
that “zhe4 sou1 chuan2 jin1tian1 zhuang1yun4 le
yi1 liang4 you3 gu4zhang4 de ka3che1” (The
ship loaded an inoperative truck today). The
situation happened at a specific time today
(jin1tian1) and was finished before the speaking
time, i.e., the present moment. The situation
refers to an event rather than a state. The process
of loading the truck took a period of time; and
the realization of the situation is focused. Our
aim now is to generate an appropriate aspect
expression for this particular loading situation by
applying the semantic information represented in
the input specification.
The aspect-related semantic information in the
input specification is as follows. Because the
situation was finished before the present moment,
we can consider that both the initial time ti and
the terminating time tt precede the present
moment. Because the situation took a period of
time, the initial time ti is regarded as preceding
the terminating time tt. Because the realization of
the situation is focused, the reference time tr is
considered as being located at the terminating
time. Representing these temporal relations with
our qualitative time values illustrated in Figure 3,
we have the following: SPEAKINGTIME has
the value at-present which is a default value.
REFERENCETIME has the value at-past-future
and is a specific time point. INITIALTIME, with
respect to other relevant times, has the value at-
past-past, indicating the occurrence time of the
situation. The value of TERMINATINGTIME
equals that of REFERENCETIME, i.e. at-past-
future. This means that the state of the situation
indicated by the aspect to be generated is viewed
from the terminating time. Theoretically, the
reference time of an aspect, i.e., the viewing
point of the aspect, establishes specific temporal
relations with the internal temporal constituency
of the situation reflecting what the speaker
focuses on when s/he views the state of a
situation. In our present case, the reference time
is placed at the terminating time of the situation,
indicating that the speaker’s focus is on the
termination or completion of the situation. If
REFERENCE-TIME has other values, e.g., at-
present, which is after the terminating time, it
indicates that the focus of the speaker is on either
the recent past or experiential meaning of the
situation, rather than on the termination or
completion of the situation. Correspondingly,
they show temporal structures of different
aspects.
In the input specification, several parameters
are also used to represent the conceptual features
of the aspect. The conceptual features and the
corresponding parameters define the space of
possible aspect-related semantic variation: this
shows precisely which facets of aspectual
semantics are grammaticised in the language; the
particular grammatical consequences are then
distributed over the grammatical choice points
defined in the grammatical component. When
using this for generation, any given situation to
be expressed must be ‘re-conceptualized’ in
terms of parameters provided. This should be
done by the user interested in investigating the
grammatical realizations of distinct temporal
relations. The parameter CHANGEABLITY has
the value change-of-state, indicating the
completion of the situation. The value of the
parameter STATE-ACTION-PROPERTY is
event, indicating that the situation is not of type
state and can be viewed as a whole. Both the
parameter EXCLUSIVENESS-TI and the
parameter EXCLUSIVENESS-TT have the value
included, indicating that the time interval over
which the situation holds is closed at its two end
points. This means that the situation occurred at
some specific time and finished. The parameter
REPEATABILITY has the value irrelevant,
indicating not being related to any particular
conceptual feature.
Referring to the semantics above, we follow
the system traversal to generate an aspect
expression by evaluating the relevant inquiries.
The traversal starts from the system of WITH-
ASPECT-MARKER-TYPE and needs to make a
choice among its three options: imperfective,
perfective, and imminent. Corresponding to the
definition of aspect in the present research,
perfective, imperfective, and imminent aspects
are interpreted in the following ways: perfective
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.997673">
634
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999944962962964">
is the way of viewing the states of a situation
with respect to its internal temporal constituency
from outside the situation structure: the viewing
point of the aspect is after or equal to the
terminating time, i.e., tt&lt;tr; imperfective is the
way of viewing the states of a situation with
respect to its internal temporal constituency
inside the situation structure: the viewing point
of the aspect ranges from the initial time,
including the initial time, to the terminating time
of the situation, i.e., ti&lt;tr&lt;tt; imminent is the way
of viewing the occurrence of a situation from
outside the situation structure and with the
viewing point shortly before the initial time of
the situation, i.e., tr&lt;ti and Ptr-ti=shortly-precede.
The temporal relations of the perfective,
imperfective, and imminent aspects are captured
by specifying appropriate values for the inquiries
named perfective-q-code, imperfective-q-code,
and imminent-q-code respectively. When
operating within the context of a full generation
system, these values would generally be
provided via the results of text planning in the
usual manner.
The with-aspect-marker-type chooser,
which takes the form of a decision tree as
described in section 4.1, is in charge of
making the selection by asking relevant
inquiries to see what type of aspect has the
semantic applicability conditions which
match the semantic inputs represented in the
input specification. The fine classification
and distinct semantic descriptions of
different aspects are sufficient to constrain
choice regardless of their particular order of
application. Therefore, alternative
implementations of the choosers, such as
specifications of feature vectors, could be
envisioned. Possible consequences of such
changes for the other components of the
generation architecture would then need to
be considered, however. Because in the
present case both the terminating time tt and
the reference time tr have the value at-past-
future that meets the temporal condition
required by the perfective aspects, the option
perfective is chosen and the system of
PERFECTIVE-PRIMARY-TYPE is entered.
After entering the system of PERFECTIVE-
PRIMARY-TYPE, a selection among three
options recent-past (the REP aspect
V+(NP)+lai2zhe), experiential (the unmarked-
experiential aspect V+guo and the marked-
experiential aspect ceng2jing1+V+(guo)), and
realized (the URE aspect V+le and the perfect
aspect yi3jing+V+(le)) has to be made. The
perfective-primary-type chooser is responsible
for making this choice. Accordingly, the chooser
firstly evaluates the inquiries named recent-past-
q-code and experiential-q-code respectively. The
recent-past (REP) aspect V+(NP)+lai2zhe serves
to indicate that a durative situation existed not
long ago. The semantic applicability conditions
represented by the ASF of the REP aspect
V+(NP)+lai2zhe include the following: the
situation expressed by the aspect shows the
feature durative which can be represented in the
temporal relation ti&lt;tt; the terminating time of the
situation precedes the reference time, i.e., tt&lt;tr;
and the reference time tr is a specific time point.
A further condition required is represented by the
parameter Ptt-tr with the value shortly-precede,
indicating the qualitative distance from tt to tr.
The parameter EXL has the value excluded and
included for the initial time ti and the terminating
time tt respectively.
After evaluating the inquiry of recent-past-q-
code, the perfective-primary-type chooser gives a
negative result, indicating that the semantics
presented by the input specification does not
match the semantic applicability conditions of
the REP aspect. One obvious mismatch is
reflected in the temporal relation between the
terminating time tt and the reference time tr. The
condition given by the input specification is tt=tr,
while the condition required by the REP aspect is
tt&lt;tr.
After failing to select the REP aspect, the
perfective-primary-type chooser continues to
evaluate the inquiry associated with the
experiential aspects. The experiential aspects
include the unmarked-experiential (UEX) aspect
V+guo and the marked-experiential (MEX)
aspect ceng2jing1+V+(guo). Although the two
experiential aspects have some differences in
usage (cf. Yang, 2007), they have the same
aspectual function to indicate that a situation
existed at least once in the past and was over, not
having current relevance. The semantic
applicability conditions shared by the two
experiential aspects are: the terminating time tt
precedes the reference time tr; the situation
referred to has the feature repeatable; the
parameter EXLti has the value either excluded or
included; the parameter EXLtt has the value
included.
Similarly to the failure of selecting the REP
aspect elaborated above, the evaluation of the

<bodyText confidence="0.999985864864865">
inquiry of experiential-q-code will also fail
because the semantic applicability conditions of
the experiential aspects do not meet the semantic
information shown in the input specification.
Except for the mismatch of the temporal
relations, the conceptual feature repeatable
required by the experiential aspects is also absent
in the input specification.
When both the REP aspect and the
experiential aspects have been excluded, the
perfective-primary-type chooser selects aspects
of realized type, and then the traversal enters the
system of REALIZED-TYE, then a further
selection between the URE aspect V+le and the
PEF aspect yi3jing+V+(le) has to be made. The
realized-type chooser is responsible for making
this selection. To make the selection, the
realized-type chooser firstly evaluates the inquiry
unmarked-realized-q-code to check whether the
semantic applicability conditions of the URE
aspect V+le can be met. The inquiry unmarked-
realized-q-code is defined according to the ASF
of the URE aspect as shown in Figure 2. The
realized-type chooser evaluates the inquiry
unmarked-realized-q-code by comparing the
input semantics with the semantic applicability
conditions of the URE aspect. The evaluation of
the unmarked-realized inquiry succeeds because
all the predicates of the unmarked-realized-q-
code give the value T (Due to the space limit, we
will not describe the whole process of evaluation
in detail here). Hence, according to the algorithm
of the realized-type chooser, the URE aspect
V+le should be chosen and the perfect-q-code
does not need to be evaluated. The generated
sentence, marked up to show its constituency, is
then as follows:

With the method elaborated above, a test-bed of
forty aspect expressions of the Chinese aspect
system has been correctly generated in the forms
of both Chinese phonetic alphabet and characters.
In the present research the application of the
ASFs provides a formal way to represent
semantic applicability conditions of the aspects;
the grammatical network built on the basis of
systemic functional grammar systematically
organizes and distinguishes semantic functions
of different aspects. The computational
implementation verifies both grammatical
organization and semantic descriptions of the
Chinese aspects. The complete system files and

In the system, the semantics of different aspects is characterized by specific temporal and conceptual features. The semantic applicability conditions of each individual aspect are theoretically represented by an aspect selection function (ASF).

The semantic applicability conditions are represented by the aspect selection function (ASF) of the aspect. The ASF of a specific aspect assumed by the present research is, therefore, principally composed of two sets of predicates: one set of predicates for testing temporal relations (Allen, 1984; Yang &amp; Bateman, 2002), another for testing the values, i.e. conceptual features, of parameters associated with the aspect. All the predicates are connected with conjunctions at the top level. At the lower levels, the logical relations among the predicates can be a conjunction and, a disjunction or and a negation not. To evaluate the truth condition of the ASF for a specific aspect, the values of all relevant temporal relations and parameters are evaluated.

Finally in Section 5, we make a brief conclusion. 2 The semantic features of the aspects One of the methods adopted in aspect studies is to use semantic features to characterize different situations (cf. Comrie, 1976; Smith, 1991, 1997; Olsen, 1997; and Dai, 1997). This is also taken as the basic principle in the present research. For the purpose of characterizing the semantics of an aspect, the features needed are not only those reflecting the properties of situation types, but also those reflecting the temporal relations between the viewing points and the internal temporal constituencies of the situations. When we establish a system of aspects, we say that the features used are necessary and sufficient if different aspects included can be distinguished from each other by means of these features.

As far as the temporal structures of aspects are concerned, there is an extreme case: when the terminating time tt precedes the reference time tr, in which case the time period of the situation is definitely closed at the terminating time tt.

For the purpose of characterizing the semantics of an aspect, the features needed are not only those reflecting the properties of situation types, but also those reflecting the temporal relations between the viewing points and the internal temporal constituencies of the situations. When we establish a system of aspects, we say that the features used are necessary and sufficient if different aspects included can be distinguished from each other by means of these features. Consequently, the more aspect expressions are involved,</context>

The semantic applicability conditions are represented by the aspect selection function (ASF) of the aspect. The ASF of a specific aspect assumed by the present research is, therefore, principally composed of two sets of predicates: one set of predicates for testing temporal relations (Allen, 1984; Yang &amp; Bateman, 2002), another for testing the values, i.e. conceptual features, of parameters associated with the aspect. All the predicates are connected with conjunctions at the top level. At the lower levels, the logical relations among the predicates can be a conjunction and, a disjunction or and a negation not. To evaluate the truth condition of the ASF for a specific aspect, the values of all relevant temporal relations and parameters are evaluated.

The generation is realized by evaluating implemented inquiries which formally define the ASFs, traversing the grammatical network, and making aspect selections. 1 Introduction Aspect is one of the most controversial topics among linguists and philosophers. Unlike the function of tense, which relates the time of situation to a deictic center, aspects are different ways of viewing the states of a situation with respect to the situation’s internal temporal constituency (Yang, 2007). This paper describes our system for generating Chinese aspect expressions. The aspect forms covered in the present research were derived from a corpus analysis. The main task of the aspect research from a computational perspective is to implement computationally both the semantic interpretations and the grammatical realizations of aspects as formulated in theoretical work. The theoretical principle of this is, to a large extent, based on Montague’s intensional logic (Montague, 1970; Dowty, 1979; Bestougeff and Ligozat, 1992, Portner and Partee, 2002).

One obvious mismatch is reflected in the temporal relation between the terminating time tt and the reference time tr. The condition given by the input specification is tt=tr, while the condition required by the REP aspect is tt&lt;tr. After failing to select the REP aspect, the perfective-primary-type chooser continues to evaluate the inquiry associated with the experiential aspects. The experiential aspects include the unmarked-experiential (UEX) aspect V+guo and the marked-experiential (MEX) aspect ceng2jing1+V+(guo). Although the two experiential aspects have some differences in usage (cf. Yang, 2007), they have the same aspectual function to indicate that a situation existed at least once in the past and was over, not having current relevance. The semantic applicability conditions shared by the two experiential aspects are: the terminating time tt precedes the reference time tr; the situation referred to has the feature repeatable; the parameter EXLti has the value either excluded or included; the parameter EXLtt has the value included. Similarly to the failure of selecting the REP aspect elaborated above, the evaluation of the 635 inquiry of experiential-q-code will also fail because the</context>
