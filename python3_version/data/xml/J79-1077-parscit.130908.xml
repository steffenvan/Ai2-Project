FINANCIAL STkTUS

<bodyText confidence="0.994394045454545">
Don Walker, Secretary-Treasurer, reviewed the financial status of the
Association, a copy of which is attached to these Minutes. He presented
income and expehses both for T977 and for 1978 through 21 Jay. The
balances of $6,332.19 for 1977 and $7,060.63 for 1978 constitute asset8
of $13,392.82. However, the major costs for AJ&apos;CL for the current year
are yet to be incurred, and dues for AFIPS have not yet been billed. At
the same time, the $1,000 advance to cover costs of the TINLAP-2 Meeting
is likely be returned, along with a portion of the excess &apos;of income over
expenses, which will be shared with ACM/SIGART.
The indebtedness of the Association to the Center for Applied
Linguistics, which housed the previous Secretariat, has been paid off.
Of the total of $13,4864.061 funds from the previous Secretariat provided
$9,913.92; $3,572.14 was taken out of income for 1977.
Walker remarked that the income item from AFIPS for 1977 of $2,365,
which refleeted a disbursement of surplus funds from the National
Computer Conference, was unlikely to be repeated again soon. AFIPS is
in the process of creating a new journal, ABACUS, modeled after
Scientific American, and future surpluses probably will be used to
defray or at least to backup the startup costs. The journal is expected
to be self-sustaining, and might eventually show a profit.
The current balance in the TINLAP-1 Account is $109.41; approximately 75
copies remain.

MEMBERSHIP
Walker reported membership figures for 1977 of 500 individual and 201
institutional, for a total of 701. The current figures for 1978,
through 21 July, are 405 individual and 208 institutional, for a total
of 613. A slightly more detailed breakdown is attached to these
Minutes.

EDITOR&apos;S REPORT
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.970210645161291">
Dave Hays, Editor of the AJCL, announced that he was resigning,
effective at the end of the year. The next issue will include the
TINLAP Proceedings; the final issue of the current year will contain a
complete index for the five years of its publication. The Journal was
established in 1974 as an NSF-sponsored experiment in microfiche
publication. Anticipating the implications of George Heidorn&apos;s survey
(see below), Hays remarked that this mode of publication is likely to be
replaced by microprocessor technology and might never repeive a full
scale trial.
Allep expressed the gratitude of the Association to Hays for his
devotion, his constructiveness, and his tireless efforts in establishing
and sustaining the AJCL. This tribute was affirmed by the members.
Allen then announced that Heidorn, currently Associate Editor, would
replace Hays as Editor in January.
A NEW FORMAT FOR THE AJCI.k
Heidorn presented the results of his survey of the membership regarding
a new format for the AJCL. Of 513 questionnaires mailed (to both
current members and to members who paid for 1977 but not yet for 1978);
212 were returned. The responses favored creation of a hard copy
edition, similar in format to the Communications of the ACM, with or
without an acoompanying microfiche version. Most members felt that such
a change would encourage a wider readership and an increase in the
submission of techical articles. A more comprehensive report by Heidorn
is included elsewhere in this iss4e.
Allen reported that the Executive Committee, after reviewing Heidorn&apos;s
findings, has decided to issue the Journal in the new format with both
hard copy and microfiche versions sent to each membetf beginning with
the first issue of 1979. The microfiche also may contain appendixes for
technical articles, program listings, and other material of interest to
the membership but less appropriate for inclusion in hard copy form,
like the list of members.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.701672" genericHeader="method">
NEXT MEETING
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9430895">
Allen stated that a decision about the time and place of the 1979
meeting had not yet been made. Asilomar, near Monterey in California,
is being considered, possibly around the time of the next International
Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, which will be held in Tokyo
from 20 to 24 August. In the discussion, members expressed concern that
the choice should not discourage attendance by graduate students.
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.8852765">
For 1980, the Executive Committee recommended that a third TINLAP
meeting be held. The President, Vice President, and Secretary-Treasurer
constitute an interim committee to investigate this possibility and to
negotiate with SIGART, as appropriate. Allen also remarked that an
offer already had been received from Aravind Joshi to host TINLAP-3 at
the University of Pennsylvania.

Carol Lane presented a resolution supporting the ratification of the

<bodyText confidence="0.993007052631579">
Equal Rights Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. After extensive
discussion and after motions to amend and to table were defeated, the
members affirmed the following substitute resolution by a vote of 20 to
13:
WHEREAS, inclusion in the Constitution of these United States
is the basic unalienable right of every citizen;
WHEREAS, the Association for Computational Linguistics views
as intolerable the selective exclusion of over one-half
the population of this country;
WHEREAS, the Equal Rights Amendment, writing women into the
Constitution, must be ratified by three-fourths of the
states (38) prior to its incorporation
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that all future conventions,
meetings, and conferences of the Association for
Computational Linguistics will, for the duration of time
during which the Equal Rights Amendment is under
consideration by the several states of the United States,
be held only in those states that have ratified the Equal
Rights Amendment.

Waltz, his session organizers, and the Universlty of Illinois for the
organization and conduct of the meeting; to the National Science
Foundation, and particularly to Carol Ganz Brown, for its financial
support; to the current officers for their constructive-efforts during
the first part of their elective term (and with encouragement to
continue these efforts for the rest of the year); to the retiring

Dave Hays called attention to the efforts of Martin and Iris Kay in the
preparation of the AJCL Bibliography, and they were duly included in the
list of resolutions.
The members affirmed these sentiments enthusiastically, and Allen
directed the Secretary-Treasurer to express the appreciation of the
Association formally to Dave Waltz.,
The meeting adjourned.

The University of Texas at Austin announces
a special Summer Linguistics Program
which will consist of a substantial offering
of graduate courses given by our own
faculty members and a distinguished list of
visiting scholars. In addition to these
courses, workshops and seminars (for
credit as conference courses by arrange-
ment with individual faculty members)
will be available on topics such as syntac-
tic universals, conditions on rule applica-
tion. PF.cily and scope, formal vs. substan-
tive explanation in phonology, etc. We in-
vite applications from graduate students in
linguistics and allied disciplines such as
education, English, foreign languages, psy-
chology, philosophy, anthropology, and
others.
The list of courses and instructors will in-
clude the following:

In addition to the above-listed faculty
members, the following scholars will be
available for individual consultatibn:&apos; Lee
Baker, Peter Cole, David DeCamp, Polly
Jacobson, Lauri ICarttunen, W. P. Leh-
mann, Fritz Newmeyer, Susan Schmerling,
and others. Several intensive Oriental and
European language courses will also be
taught as a part of the regular UT summer
session.
Low cost accommodations will be availa-
ble in housing cooperatives. Classes will
begin June 13 and exams will end July 20;
the Program will thus not conflict with the
LSA Linguistic Institute in Salzburg.
Tuition and fees: For Texas residents, the
price of summer courses is $64.70 for one
three-hour course, $89.90 for two three-
hour courses. For out-of-state residents, it
Is $159.70 for one three-hour course,
$304.90 for two three-hour courses. In ad-
dition, there is a $10.00 property fee,
refundable at the end of the course.

During the summer of 1978, Alan K. Melby wrote to many
American universities, asking about the graduate work
in computational linguistics. He has supplied a copy
of his list of affirmative answers, presented here in
the casual format of its compilation. Melby points out
that MIT and Yale did not respond but would be considered
by a student planning work on computers and language.

The concept of an evolving theory [3] is a natural
extension of concepts in free tense logic with equality.
In the semantics of free tense logic, an individual can
have a property at one time that it does not at another,
the domain of discourse can vary with the passage of time
as individuals are born and die, and individual terms can
refer at one time but not at another. Understanding a
theory to be a set of sentences in the language of free
tense logic with equality, an evolving theory is an indexed
set of theories ordered in time. Intuitively, an evolving
theory might represent the life work of a thinker, where
the individual theories in the evolving theory correspond
to chapters of the life work written at different tiMes.
The evolving theory reflects changes in the thinker&apos;s
views with the passage of time.
Evolving theories have been studied from both semantic
and proof theoretic perspectives, and various concepts
such as the semantic concept of satipfiability and the
proof theoretic concept of consistency have been extended
to apply to evolving theories N. The semantic 8 is given
rn terms of metaphor theory which stands intermediate

between Leblanc&apos;s truth-.value semantics and model theory
and translates readily into both. &apos;The deductive system
for (a class of) evolving theories is called the forest
method because a tree is generated for each point in time.
The forest method, in effect a generalization of Kripke
tableaux constructions, is mechanizable. The- forest
method is correct with respect to the semantics H.
The forest method can be applied wherever the&apos; restriction
on the temporal order relation has the computable Kripke
Closure Property, a property of properties of relations
which has been characterized model theoretically in Pl.
The computable Kripke closures are a subclass of the
monotonic closures which have closure properties much
like transitivity (a computable Kripke and monotonic closure).
A preservation theorem giving the syntactic form of
axiomatizations of the first-order monotonic closures [7]
suggests a generalization of the Roy-Warshall transitive
closure algorithm. The preservation theorem might also
be used to determine (much as an entry in an engineering
handbook) whether, given a property of relations Pr, there
is a Pr-closure algorithm.
Evolving theories can be based in other intensional
logics such as as modal Ni and intuitionistic logics.
Some (but notoall) of the logics underlying kinds of evolving
theories where the forest method is apIlicable can be
axiomatized [1, 6].

<bodyText confidence="0.962455269230769">
In certain (but not all) cases, the forest method
(or restrictions of It) can be used to give effective
proofs of the extended joint consiStency theorem, a result
which incorporates the Craig and Lyndon interpolation
lemmas and the Robinson joint consistency theorem.
Roughly, the theorem states that two theories Tl and T2 are mutu-
allyinconsistent just-in case there is a separating sentence
F such that F (not F) is a logical consequence of Tl (T2)
and F &amp;quot;talks about&amp;quot; only individuals and relations that
both T1 and T2 do. Effective proofs of the theorem are
well-known in standard first-order logic, and siMilar results
have been established&apos; in free logic with equality [5]
and in a family of free modal logics with. equality[!a.
Since the proof is effective, a (depth first) algorithm
can be extracted from it for constructing, given a closed
forest for the union of T1 and T2&apos; a separating sentence F.
Evolving theories, outfitted with additional devices
to enhance their plausibility, appear to be a natual for
representing temporal knowledge. When the extended joint
consistency theorem holds for the representation langtiage
of a knowledge base and when an effective proof has been
given, the separating sentence algorithm might be a
useful tool for pinpointing inconsistencies in the knowledve
base [2]. Only very restricted versions of the algorithms
mentioned, above have been programmed, those in LISP [2]
and SNOBOL.

Machine aids to translation, or MAT, is a loosely defined field
whose boundaries shade gradually into such areas as computer science,
information science, computational linguistics, and theoretical linguistics.
It is therefore difficult to decide precisely what material belongs in a MAT
bibliography. On can cast the, net broadly and include a great deal of
material that considers MAT only tanbentially, or be more restrictive and
include only the (much smaller body of) work which clearly concerns MAT.
The&apos;Jatter course is taken- here in order to avoid burying the essential
literature under a mountain of peripheral references. Thus, the enormous
body of work on fully automatic machine translation is not included-(ithough
Young (1978) contains an extensive survey of this literature). A few exceptions
to this principle of inclusion (e.g., ALPAC, 1966) provide important con-
textual information concerning the history, current status, or future develop-
ment of MAT.
While the history and current theoretical concerns of MAT are
covered in the bibliography, the emphasis is on applications and operational

systems. This reflects the development of MAT as a more practical alterna-
tive to pure machine translation and its position as one of the only areas
of computational lingustics that has progressed to the point of wide scale
application.
A few other ground rules have been followed. First, since the
field continues to change so rapidly and this is a state-of-the-art survey,
few references over a decade old are included. Second, where a single
MAT system is described almost identically in several research reports
and/or publications in several languages, only a single reference is given,
in English where possibTe. Third, works dealing strictly with hardware
advances such as new graphics display technology, micropragrammable display
fonts, or multilingual printers are also excluded.
This bibliography was compiled from a much larger one containing
nearly 750 entries and is intended to provide a concise summary of the
current work in the field with strong focus as stated above on machine
aided translation systems that are presently in operatim*

The comments on the dust jacket for the third edition of Colin Cherry&apos;s
On Human Communication come from reviews of previous editions which appeared
in such diverse places as the Canadian Journal of Psychology, Physics Today,
and Romance Philologz,ahd indite that it is a broad ranging and fascinating
book. The range is certainly broad, so broad that I have included a table—
of contents as an appendix to this review rather than attempting to summarize
the contents of the hook.
But it is no longer fascinating. Students of human communication
have thought and debated much and even learned a little between the pub-
lication of the first edition of On Human Communication in 1957 and the pub-
lication of the third edition in 1978. But very little of that material has
become part of the substance of Cherry&apos;s book (although some of it is cited).
Thus, while the first edition may well have been &amp;quot;A Review, a Survey, and
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.983680333333333">
a Criticism&amp;quot; (the book&apos;s subtitle), the third edition is not. Too much is
left unconsidered.
The most serious gap is in the consideration of natural languages.
Cherry gives the impression that information theory, statistics, Fourier
analysis, and perhaps a little logic are the most important formal tools
for the analysis of natural language. That may have been true when Cherry
wrote the first edition of the book, but it is certainly not true now.
Cherry does make a few references to Chomsky, but none of the substance of
the Chom6kian revolution (not to mention post-Chomskian developments) has
affected Cherry&apos;s treatment of natural language. The texture of theorizing
and model building in linguistics, psycholinguistics, and cognitive psychology
has undergone considerable change since the Fifties, but little of that
has become part of the substance of On Human Communication.
Similarly, a great deal of work has been done on nonverbal communication
in the last two decades. While Cherry alludes to some of this work, he
makes no attempt toksummarize any of the major lines of inquiry. As with
modern linguistics, the mateial is too diverse to cover it all in the sort
of survey Which Cherry intends On Human OommunicatiOn to be. What I find
so disheartening is that so little of this material is mentioned 8,t all,
especially when one realizes that Cherry has added a new chapter (&amp;quot;Human
Communication: Peeling, Knowing, and Understanding&amp;quot;) to the third edition
for the purpose of talking abut what is specifically human about human
communication. That Cherry should devote ten pages to Zipf&apos;s law while
not even mentioning the work of Paul Ekman, Carroll Izard, and Manfred

the expression and communication of emotion is bizarre.
-vinally, Cherry&apos;s treatment of semiotics is relatively insulated from
most of the_semiotic research of the last two deeades. Semiotics is itself

such a diverse and amorphous enterprise (as diverse and amorphous as the
study of human communication is) that it is perhaps unfair to criticise
Cherry for shortchanging it. But Cherry introduced the topie of ritual
into his final chapter and that is a subject on Which semioticians have
had a great deal to say (I am thinking of structural anthropologists such
as Claude Levi-Strauss, Edmund Leach, and Victor Turner). Cpnsequently
I am inclined to view Cherry&apos;s neglect of gemiotics perhaps more
harshly than I otherwise would.

<note confidence="0.30512">
No doubt Cherry could be charged with other sins of omission, but the

three I&apos;ve mentioned are serious enough. It is equally beyond doubt that
an edition of On Human Communication which included this material would be
a very different book, not Colin Cherry&apos;s book at all. If Cherry had,
attempted and achieved a synthesis of his material, then its value as a synthesis

<reference confidence="0.7284589">
might well outweigh the dated nature of some of the elements of the synthesis.
But Cherry wasn&apos;t after a synthesis; he simply wanted to see what wag out
there. There is now much out there which Cherry hasn&apos;t seen. Consequently
On Human Communication is not a good guide. The person mho wants or nepds
a general introduction to the subject of human communication which reflects
the current state of the art(s) will have to look elsewhere.

JUrgen Kunze establishes his dependency grammar with
four components. The syntactic is the most important. The
three non-syntactic components are the paradigmatic component,
the selectional component, and the assigning component. In the
first chapter of his book ABHANGIGKEITSGRAMMATIK (Dependency
Grammar) the reader gets introduced to some of the basic concepts
useful in Understanding the notions explicated later Qn. Sub-
ordination or dependency is introduced by way of a diagram, known
as a tree, consisting of several connected points. A point or
node that is connected to one closer to the top of the page is
subordinate to it. This is called direct dependency. Indirect
subordination is when two nodes are connected with one or more
points in between them. These three nodes comprise a part tree.
Kunz review 48
Obviously there are several part trees which combine to make a tree.
If the bottom-most node of our little part tree is not superordinate
to any other point then the part tree is an end complex. Every
node is an end. complex with itself as its only member.
Once one decides to attach words to these nodes it changes
from a connect the dots game to some sort of meaningful diaPrem The
first step in this change is to bring order to the diagram. Since
language is the object of study here and the language the book was
written in procedes from left to right, the author has ordered his
tree from left to right. This type of tree is known as a W tree,
i.e. There each node is attached to a word. The book deals with
M trees. These are trees in which the nodes are connected to signal
combinations (Merkmalkombinationen). A marked tree is one in which
all the connections are subordinate relations on one kind or another
from a set containing all the kinds of subordinate relations pos-
sible.
In making his investigatioAs, Kunze has limited his field
of study to modern day written German. This suffices as for in any
pure theoretical investigation it is acceptable to assume the ob-
served language is a set of given sentences. The practicability
of his theory depends on finding a standard of correctness. In
this case tapping the knowledge of a native speaker is of no help
Four ways are suggested as possibilities for this standard of cor-
rectness. The first is grammatical correctness in which all sen-
tences are acceptable as long as they function as members of their
classes, i.e. nouns as nouns, verbs as verbs. Second is a more
refined grammatital correctness taking the meaning of the verb
into account. Third is the suggestion of a very strict grammar
Kunz review 49
bordering on grammar and semantics including semantic categories
such as ABSTRACT or CONCRETE. The fourth consideration is a
semantic grammatical correctness. Though this standard of correct-
ness is needed to make the theory work, measuring correctness is
not a major factor.
There is, says Kunze, a base language and base structures
that can express semantic and syntactic ambiguities. It is important
when studying these structures to consider which categories and
qualities are contained in it. A category is a variable with set
value ranges, for example, in German, case. Qualities are restrictions
imposed for ordering, appearance or non appearance of sentence frag-
ments. Plainly-not all categories and qualities are in every
sentence of a language. An expansion of the base language leads to
a simplification of the descriptive system but also costs quite a
bit as far as analysis is concerted.
On starting into the meat of the matter tha author writes
that in no way can one expect such a simple tool as dependency
trees to encompass the linguistic relations within the sentence
that are conditioned through language. This inadequacy is evidenced
by the following situation. Every grammatical structure has an or-
dered dependency tree. It is however possible to have two different
structures represented by the same tree. This is one of the
principles for the representation of sentence structures using

An interesting concept is introduded by the author. He
calles it the configuration criterion. It ways that one element
is substitutable for another it it has all the same grammatical
properties. This concept is used frequently in deciding what is
dependent on what.
The fourth chapter deals with the non-syntactic components.
Paradigmatic categories are established. The categories are
Gnus, commonly called gender, Person, and Number. Each of these
three categories is established on the basis of data similar to
the following example. I saw him. We saw him. These two sen-
tences are syntactically equal but paradigmatically quite different.
This illustrates the category of number, the first person singular
changes to the first person plural. The author splits these
categories again to account for the phenomenon of endings in
German. It is possible to have a possessive pronoun with a mas-
culine ending referring to a female person. Quasi categories are
also established. These are tempus, modus, and case, and they
are only quasi categories because they affect other parts of
speech in a sentence. Kunze constructs a list which enumerates
the category responsible for their relations, e.g. a noun is
paradigmatically related to its apposite through case.
The separation of the paradigmatic from the selectional
is due to the ease with which the former are presentable. Selec-
tional relations are more narrowly defined in this case than in
generative grammar. As with the paradigmatic relations there
are nine selectional relations, five of which belong to the in-

<abstract confidence="0.949718683544304">Allen noted that the minutes of the previous meeting had been published Finite Volume 14, Number Microfiche 65 of the Journalof Linguistics. FINANCIAL STkTUS Walker, reviewed financial status of the Association, a copy of which is attached to these Minutes. He presented and expehses both for for 1978 through 21 Jay. The of $6,332.19 for $7,060.63 for 1978 constitute asset8 $13,392.82. However, the major costs for AJ&apos;CLfor the current are yet to be incurred, and dues for AFIPS have not yet been billed. At the same time, the $1,000 advance to cover costs of the TINLAP-2 Meeting is likely be returned, along with a portion of the excess &apos;of income over expenses, which will be shared with ACM/SIGART. The indebtedness of the Association to the Center for Applied Linguistics, which housed the previous Secretariat, has been paid off. the total of funds from the previous Secretariat provided $3,572.14 taken out of income for remarked that the income item from AFIPS for $2,365, which refleeted a disbursement of surplus funds from the National Computer Conference, was unlikely to be repeated again soon. AFIPS is the process of creating a new journal, ABACUS,modeled after ScientificAmerican,and future surpluses probably will be used to defray or at least to backup the startup costs. The journal is expected be self-sustaining, and might show a current balance the TINLAP-1 is $109.41; approximately copies remain. MEMBERSHIP reported membership figures for 500 individual and 201 for a total of 701. The current figures for through 21 July, are 405 individual and 208 institutional, for a total of 613. A slightly more detailed breakdown is attached to these Minutes. 3 4 EDITOR&apos;S REPORT Hays, Editor of the AJCL,announced that he was resigning, effective at the end of the year. The next issue will include the TINLAP Proceedings; the final issue of the current year will contain a complete index for the five years of its publication. The Journal was established in 1974 as an NSF-sponsored experiment in microfiche publication. Anticipating the implications of George Heidorn&apos;s (see below), Hays remarked that this mode of publication is likely to be replaced by microprocessor technology and might never repeive a full scale trial. Allep expressed the gratitude of the Association to Hays for his devotion, his constructiveness, and his tireless efforts in establishing sustaining the AJCL.This tribute was affirmed by the Allen then announced that Heidorn, currently Associate Editor, would replace Hays as Editor in January. A NEW FORMAT FOR THE AJCI.k Heidorn presented the results of his survey of the membership regarding new format for the AJCL.Of 513 questionnaires mailed (to both current members and to members who paid for 1977 but not yet for 1978); returned. The responses favored creation of a hard similar in format to the Communicationsof the ACM, with or without an acoompanying microfiche version. Most members felt that such a change would encourage a wider readership and an increase in the submission of techical articles. A more comprehensive report by Heidorn is included elsewhere in this iss4e. Allen reported that the Executive Committee, after reviewing Heidorn&apos;s findings, has decided to issue the Journal in the new format with both hard copy and microfiche versions sent to each membetf beginning with the first issue of 1979. The microfiche also may contain appendixes for technical articles, program listings, and other material of interest to the membership but less appropriate for inclusion in hard copy form, like the list of members. NEXT MEETING Allen stated that a decision about the time and place of the 1979 meeting had not yet been made. Asilomar, near Monterey in California, is being considered, possibly around the time of the next International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, which will be held in Tokyo to 24 August. In the discussion, members expressed concern that the choice should not discourage attendance by graduate students. For 1980, the Executive Committee recommended that a third TINLAP meeting be held. The President, Vice President, and Secretary-Treasurer constitute an interim committee to investigate this possibility and to negotiate with SIGART, as appropriate. Allen also remarked that an offer already had been received from Aravind Joshi to host TINLAP-3 at the University of Pennsylvania.</abstract>

<affiliation confidence="0.969579">Temple University</affiliation>
<abstract confidence="0.982667833333334">The concept of an evolving theory [3] is a natural extension of concepts in free tense logic with equality. In the semantics of free tense logic, an individual can have a property at one time that it does not at another, the domain of discourse can vary with the passage of time as individuals are born and die, and individual terms can refer at one time but not at another. Understanding a theory to be a set of sentences in the language of free logic with equality, an theoryis an indexed set of theories ordered in time. Intuitively, an evolving theory might represent the life work of a thinker, where the individual theories in the evolving theory correspond to chapters of the life work written at different tiMes. The evolving theory reflects changes in the thinker&apos;s views with the passage of time. Evolving theories have been studied from both semantic and proof theoretic perspectives, and various concepts such as the semantic concept of satipfiability and the proof theoretic concept of consistency have been extended apply to evolving theories N. The 8 given terms of theorywhich stands intermediate 28 2 between Leblanc&apos;s truth-.value semantics and model theory and translates readily into both. &apos;The deductive system (a class of) evolving theories is called the methodbecause a tree is generated for each point in time. The forest method, in effect a generalization of Kripke constructions, is mechanizable. forest method is correct with respect to the semantics H. The forest method can be applied wherever the&apos; restriction the temporal order relation has the Kripke Property,a property of properties of relations which has been characterized model theoretically in Pl. The computable Kripke closures are a subclass of the closureswhich have closure properties much like transitivity (a computable Kripke and monotonic closure). A preservation theorem giving the syntactic form of axiomatizations of the first-order monotonic closures [7] suggests a generalization of the Roy-Warshall transitive closure algorithm. The preservation theorem might also be used to determine (much as an entry in an engineering handbook) whether, given a property of relations Pr, there is a Pr-closure algorithm. Evolving theories can be based in other intensional such as as modal intuitionistic logics. Some (but notoall) of the logics underlying kinds of evolving theories where the forest method is apIlicable can be axiomatized [1, 6]. 29 In certain (but not all) cases, the forest method (or restrictions of It) can be used to give effective of the joint consiStency theorem,a result which incorporates the Craig and Lyndon interpolation lemmas and the Robinson joint consistency theorem. the theorem states that two theories and are mutujust-in case there is a sentence such that F (not F) is a logical consequence of and F &amp;quot;talks about&amp;quot; only individuals and relations that Effective proofs of the theorem are well-known in standard first-order logic, and siMilar results been established&apos; in free logic with equality and in a family of free modal logics with. equality[!a. Since the proof is effective, a (depth first) algorithm can be extracted from it for constructing, given a closed for the union of separating sentence F. Evolving theories, outfitted with additional devices to enhance their plausibility, appear to be a natual for representing temporal knowledge. When the extended joint consistency theorem holds for the representation langtiage a knowledge base and when an effectiveproof has been given, the separating sentence algorithm might be a useful tool for pinpointing inconsistencies in the knowledve base [2]. Only very restricted versions of the algorithms above have been programmed, those in LISP and SNOBOL. 30 REFERENCES</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.995570484848485">Machine aids to translation, or MAT, is a loosely defined field whose boundaries shade gradually into such areas as computer science, information science, computational linguistics, and theoretical linguistics. It is therefore difficult to decide precisely what material belongs in a MAT bibliography. On can cast the, net broadly and include a great deal material that considers MAT only tanbentially, or be more restrictive and include only the (much smaller body of) work which clearly concerns MAT. The&apos;Jatter course is takenhere in order to avoid burying the essential literature under a mountain of peripheral references. Thus, the enormous body of work on fully automatic machine translation is not included-(ithough Young (1978) contains an extensive survey of this literature). A few exceptions this principle of inclusion (e.g., ALPAC, 1966) provide important coninformation the history, current status, or future development of MAT. While the history and current theoretical concerns of MAT are in the bibliography, the emphasis is on operational 35 reflects the development of MAT as a more practical alternative to pure machine translation and its position as one of the only areas of computational lingustics that has progressed to the point of wide scale application. A few other ground rules have been followed. First, since the field continues to change so rapidly and this is a state-of-the-art survey, few references over a decade old are included. Second, where a single MAT system is described almost identically in several research reports and/or publications in several languages, only a single reference is given, in English where possibTe. Third, works dealing strictly with hardware advances such as new graphics display technology, micropragrammable display fonts, or multilingual printers are also excluded. This bibliography was compiled from a much larger one containing nearly 750 entries and is intended to provide a concise summary of the current work in the field with strong focus as stated above on machine aided translation systems that are presently in operatim*</abstract>

<title confidence="0.657537">The comments on the dust jacket for the third edition of Colin Cherry&apos;s</title>
<abstract confidence="0.988975275862069">Human Communicationcome from reviews of previous editions which appeared such diverse places as the Journal of Psychology, Physics Today, Philologz,ahdindite it is a broad ranging and fascinating book. The range is certainly broad, so broad that I have included a table— of contents as an appendix to this review rather than attempting to summarize the contents of the hook. But it is no longer fascinating. Students of human communication have thought and debated much and even learned a little between the pubof the first edition of Human Communicationin the publication of the third edition in 1978. But very little of that material has become part of the substance of Cherry&apos;s book (although some of it is cited). Thus, while the first edition may well have been &amp;quot;A Review, a Survey, and 42 a Criticism&amp;quot; (the book&apos;s subtitle), the third edition is not. Too much is left unconsidered. The most serious gap is in the consideration of natural languages. gives the information Fourier and perhaps a little logic are the important formal tools the analysis of natural That may have been true when Cherry wrote the first edition of the book, but it is certainly not true now. does make a few references but none of the of Chom6kian revolution to mention post-Chomskian developments) has affected Cherry&apos;s treatment of natural language. The texture of theorizing building in linguistics, psycholinguistics, and cognitive psychology undergone change since the Fifties, but little of that become part of the of Human Communication. a deal of work has been done on nonverbal communication the last two decades. While Cherry some of this work, he toksummarize of the lines of inquiry. As with modern linguistics, the mateial is too diverse to cover it all in the sort survey Which Cherry intends Human OommunicatiOnto be. What I find so disheartening is that so little of this material is mentioned 8,t all, when realizes that Cherry has added a new chapter (&amp;quot;Human Communication: Peeling, Knowing, and Understanding&amp;quot;) to the third edition the of abut what is specifically human about human That Cherry should devote ten pages Zipf&apos;s law while even mentioning work of Paul Ekman, Carroll and Manfred Clynes (to mention only the work which comes mqst readily to my mind) on of emotion is bizarre. Cherry&apos;s treatment of is from most of the_semiotic research of the last two deeades. Semiotics is itself 43 such a diverse and amorphous enterprise (as diverse and amorphous as the communication is) that it is perhaps unfair to criticise Cherry for shortchanging it. But Cherry introduced the topie of ritual into his final chapter and that is a subject on Which semioticians have had a great deal to say (I am thinking of structural anthropologists such as Claude Levi-Strauss, Edmund Leach, and Victor Turner). Cpnsequently I am inclined to view Cherry&apos;s neglect of gemiotics perhaps more harshly than I otherwise would. No doubt Cherry could be charged with other sins of omission, but the three I&apos;ve mentioned are serious enough. It is equally beyond doubt that edition of Human Communicationwhich included this material would be a very different book, not Colin Cherry&apos;s book at all. If Cherry had, attempted and achieved a synthesis of his material, then its value as a synthesis might well outweigh the dated nature of some of the elements of the synthesis. But Cherry wasn&apos;t after a synthesis; he simply wanted to see what wag out there. There is now much out there which Cherry hasn&apos;t seen. Consequently</abstract>

But Cherry wasn&apos;t after a synthesis; he simply wanted to see what wag out there. There is now much out there which Cherry hasn&apos;t seen. Consequently On Human Communication is not a good guide. The person mho wants or nepds a general introduction to the subject of human communication which reflects the current state of the art(s) will have to look elsewhere.
