Mathematical linguistics is concerned with the study of mathematical properties of
natural languages and linguistic theories. Since the mathematical properties of inter-
est to mathematical linguists are usually from theoretical computer science (complex-
ity classes, language hierarchies, formal learnability), mathematical linguistics can be
considered to be an area of theoretical computational linguistics. However, since sta-
tistical methods are rarely used in mathematical linguistics, its relationship to current
practices in computational linguistics is somewhat limited.
While the introduction of logic in linguistic research originally came from seman-
tics, this line of work did not really use sophisticated metaresults. One of the main
developments in mathematical linguistics in the last decade has been the introduction
of sophisticated logical methods to the study of natural language syntax, for instance,
the use of cut elimination and interpolation theorems in categorial grammar or B¨uchi’s
theorem relating finite automata and monadic second-order logic in model-theoretic
syntax. The book under review is written by one of the main contributors to the log-
ical turn in mathematical linguistics, and so it is not surprising that this is its main
focus.
The contents of the book are as follows: Chapter 1, “Fundamental Structures,”
gives a concise introduction to the mathematical background needed for the rest
of the book. It does not give an introduction to logic at this point, which is in-
troduced as needed in the rest of the book. Chapter 2, “Context Free Languages,”
starts with the regular languages and then discusses normal forms, parsing, and
ambiguity. It concludes with a proof of Parikh’s theorem, which states that every
context-free language is semilinear, and a discussion of non-context-free phenomena
in natural languages. Chapter 3, “Categorial Grammar and Formal Semantics,” con-
tains, in addition to an introduction to the λ-calculus and combinators, an introduc-
tion to the Lambek calculus, culminating in a complete proof of Pentus’s theorem,
which states that Lambek grammars are context-free. Chapter 4, “Semantics”, intro-
duces algebraic tools for the study of natural language semantics. Chapter 5, “PTIME
Languages,” discusses extensions of context-free grammars, including tree-adjoining
grammars, indexed grammars, and literal movement grammars. It includes a discus-
sion of the class of mildly context-sensitive languages, which are widely held to be
fairly good approximations to the complexity of natural languages. The last chap-
ter, chapter 6, “The Model Theory of Linguistic Structure”, is an introduction to us-
Computational Linguistics Volume 30, Number 4
ing the approach of descriptive complexity theory to define conditions on strings
and trees, as well as phonological representations. The chapter concludes with ap-
plications of the logical tools to grammar formalisms, including GPSG, HPSG, and
GB.
As can be seen from the contents, the main focus of this book is on syntax, specifi-
cally the application of formal language theory and logic to natural languages. At this
point, the classical introduction to this area is still Partee, ter Meulen, and Wall (1990).
Kracht’s book is significantly more advanced; in fact, a good working knowledge of
Partee et al. is a prerequisite to Kracht’s book. The Handbook of Logic and Language
(van Benthem and ter Meulen 1997), which contains advanced material in this area,
is much more focused on semantics than Kracht’s book. Compared to introductory
(e.g., Hopcroft and Ullman 1979) or advanced (e.g., Mart´ın-Vide, Mitrana, and P˘aun
2004) books on formal language theory, Kracht’s book emphasizes those aspects of
formal language theory that are relevant to the study of natural languages, whereas
the former do not. Thus, Kracht’s book gives a uniform introduction, which currently
does not exist at this level, to an important area of mathematical linguistics. Its main
use will be in advanced graduate courses and for researchers interested in learning
about mathematical linguistics.
The book stems from lecture notes that the author produced for a number of
classes in this area; however, on the continuum that ranges from textbooks to research
monographs, this book is located somewhere in the middle. For instance, from the
point of view of a textbook, the importance that monadic second-order logic currently
plays in mathematical linguistics would have warranted spending a larger part of
chapter 6 on it rather than on quantified modal logic, which is a somewhat idiosyn-
cratic choice. Such choices occur at a few other places in the book; however, they are
balanced by the almost encyclopedic overview of formal grammars and important
results about them that cannot currently be found in one volume. Another strength
of this book is that it introduces logical tools incrementally together with the appli-
cation for which they are needed. This reinforces the central role that logic plays in
mathematical linguistics and makes it possible to read the book as an introduction to
applied logic.
There are some minor inconsistencies. For instance, indexed grammars are intro-
duced in the chapter on PTIME languages, and it is claimed that languages generated
by indexed grammars can be parsed in PTIME, even though the recognition problem
for indexed grammars is known to be NP-complete (Rounds 1973).
The chapter on semantics is a little too brief. Given the length of the book, it
is understandable that no more space could be dedicated to it; however, it might
have been more productive to replace that material with a more detailed description
of formal models of GB, since this is an area in which Kracht has obtained many
important results. Computational linguists will probably feel that parsing is not dis-
cussed in enough detail. While chart parsing is discussed for context-free grammars, a
large number of papers on parsing of mildly context-sensitive grammars can be found
in conference proceedings, but there is no uniform introduction to this area at this
time.
While the book contains many exercises of different degrees of difficulty, I couldn’t
find any open research problems. This is unfortunate given that most readers of this
book will likely be researchers and Ph.D. students.
Overall this book is an excellent introduction to advanced topics in mathematical
linguistics that, given its advanced nature, requires a significant amount of mathemat-
ical maturity.

This book, an outcome of a 2001 workshop on example-based machine translation
(EBMT) in Santiago de Compostela, very appropriately starts with a preface by pro-
fessor Makoto Nagao in which he explains how the limits of rule-based machine
translation (MT) led him to propose his principle of translation by analogy in 1981
(published as Nagao 1984). His idea, inspired by second-language learning method-
ology, is convincing and elegant. We learn a language not by deep linguistic analysis
and rule application, but by rote learning and analogy-based generalization. Starting
from simple sentences and their translations, variations of these sentences can also be
translated by using similarity-based reasoning. If the Japanese translation of a sen-
tence such as A man eats vegetables is memorized (implicitly including changes in word
order, morphology, translation selection of eat, etc.), then a sentence such as He eats
potatoes can be translated correctly by analogy to this memorized case if the semantic
relation between he and a man and between vegetables and potatoes can be determined
(e.g., using a thesaurus). Such a method bypasses deep linguistic analysis by leaving
transfer rules implicit in an aligned bilingual corpus.
Michael Carl and Andy Way have done the field of MT and that of natural lan-
guage processing in general a big favor by producing this collection. This is the first
(fat) book-sized collection of current research in this fascinating area of MT, and it con-
tains a number of chapters that will bring anyone interested quickly up to speed in this
research area. In order to differentiate EBMT from statistical MT and rule-based MT, it
is tempting to describe it as a hybrid technique taking a middle ground between rule-
based methods (linguistic knowledge used in the representation of translation units)
and data-oriented methods (learning from bilingual parallel corpora, similarity-based
reasoning). But in reality, EBMT appears in this book as a widely varying bunch of
somehow related approaches: a concept that can best be described in an example-
based way. In their introduction, Carl and Way acknowledge this lack of an analytical
definition but see no harm in it and compare the situation with other “scientific re-
alities” such as artificial intelligence. The volume is divided into four parts, the first
being about historical and technical foundations, and the other three describing current
research.
Part I contains a wealth of background information. Chapter 1, by Harold Somers
(“An Overview of EBMT”) traces the history of the idea and dives into the underlying
problems to be solved in applying it: collecting and aligning parallel corpora, deciding
on the grain size and linguistic representation of the examples (sentence level or below,
superficial or deep?), the number and selection of examples needed, storage, indexing

and matching of examples, and issues involved in using the best matching examples to
produce grammatical output (adaptation of the retrieved knowledge). The remainder
of the chapter discusses different flavors, extensions, and uses of EBMT and describes
how EBMT has been incorporated in multiengine systems, in parallel with rule-based
and statistical systems. The anecdotal, impressionistic, and limited evaluation of EBMT
available in the literature according to Somers is surprising. Especially given the trend
toward multiengine systems, it is to be hoped that a thorough comparative evaluation
of EBMT will become available soon. Somers mentions corpus coverage, simple ex-
tension, linguistic theory-freeness, and easy development from aligned corpora as the
main advantages of EBMT and scalability and dealing with some translation problems
as its main problems. He sees it not as a rival to rule-based MT but as an enhancement
of it. Given the results of, for example, Sumita in a later chapter of the book, I think
he gives up on “pure” EBMT too easily.
Chapter 2 by Davide Torcato and Fred Popowich (“What is Example-Based Ma-
chine Translation?”) attempts to single out what sets EBMT apart from other ap-
proaches. The authors argue that the linguistic information being used by an MT
system (rather than how it is represented or acquired) should be the basis for classi-
fication. On this basis, they go to great length contending that most of the properties
of EBMT (use of parallel corpus, holistic approach, etc.) are not really distinguish-
ing properties and that only the translation-by-analogy principle stands out as truly
example-based.
In chapter 3 (“EMBT in a Controlled Environment”), Reinhard Sch¨aler, Andy Way,
and Michael Carl see EBMT (in the guise of phrasal lexicons) as a way of enhancing
translation memories (TM). TM is arguably the commercially most successful approach
to MT. The idea is probably as old as EBMT (I heard it being mentioned in the very first
workshop I ever attended in 1984 in Davos). In TM, a translator has access to previous
translations of sentences that are retrieved by (fuzzy) matching. Such an approach will
have high precision but very low recall. Sch¨aler et al. demonstrate that by extending
the approach to the subsentential level (phrases), recall can be improved. The main
contributions of this paper are pointing to the use EBMT might have in improving
the usefulness and coverage of TM systems (although that point has been made by
many others as well), analyzing how this could be done in the context of controlled
language TM, and what the benefits and limitations could be. Unfortunately it remains
a position paper more than a proof of concept.
The foundational part of the book ends with an interesting chapter by Br ´ona
Collins and Harold Somers (“EBMT Seen as Case-Based Reasoning”) in which MT is
analyzed in the framework of case-based reasoning (CBR), a well-known reasoning
approach in AI. The goal is to investigate whether other applications of CBR can con-
tribute to its application to MT. Unfortunately, the chapter doesn’t go very deep into
analyzing the relations and differences between different kinds of “lazy learning,” of
which CBR is an instance (memory-based, instance-based, and exemplar-based reason-
ing and learning methods have all been proposed in the AI literature). I would refer
people interested in that topic rather to Aha (1997) or Kasif et al. (1998). Nevertheless,
the explicit analogy between the two analogical approaches in this chapter is extensive
and insightful and may inspire new research on extensions and variations of EBMT.
EBMT systems differ in whether they acquire the knowledge implicit in the bilin-
gual corpus at runtime or off-line in advance. Runtime approaches, of which a few
are presented in part II of the book, extract their translation units during translation
from a sentence-aligned bilingual corpus. Chapter 5 (“Formalizing Translation Mem-
ory”) by Emmanuel Planas and Osamu Furuse addresses in a sense the same issues
as chapter 3, trying to extend translation memory approaches to EBMT. The way

this is done in their “shallow translation” approach is to add lemmas, POS tags, and
string-edit distance on multiple levels of sentences for matching in TM. Preliminary
evaluation comparing the matching approach to a standard TM-matching algorithm
shows that especially at high similarity thresholds, their approach retrieves more useful
cases. With the contribution of Eiichiro Sumita (“An Example-Based Machine Transla-
tion System using DP-Matching between Word Sequences”), we get near to the pure
EBMT approach, generalizing examples on the fly and not using any syntactic parsing
or bilingual treebanks. On a reasonably sized corpus (200,000 sentences), the approach
covers about 90% of the 500 test sentences, with about 80% acceptable translations,
taking 10 seconds per sentence on average. This is hopeful news for the pure approach,
although many problems remain, especially regarding handling of sparse data, long
sentences, and context dependency in the approach. Francis Bond and Satoshi Shirai
(“A Hybrid Rule and Example-Based Method for Machine Translation”) contribute an
approach to combine the strengths of rule-based and example-based approaches, and
Tantely Andriamanankasina, Kenji Araki, and Koji Tochinai (“EBMT of POS-Tagged
Sentences by Recursive Division via Inductive Learning”) apply the CBR approach to
subsententially aligned examples. Both approaches claim promising results.
Parts III and IV of the book concern approaches to and systems of EBMT that do
not acquire their knowledge from the bilingual corpus dynamically and on-line but
rather do it off-line, either as extracted translation templates (part III) or as something
that starts to resemble structural transfer rules (part IV). Notice that from the point
of view of a machine-learning interpretation of example-based reasoning and learn-
ing, something bizarre is happening here. The techniques described in these last two
parts of the book become increasingly less example-based. It is not because rules are
learned from examples that an approach becomes example-based; the crucial aspect is
that the examples themselves are used in reasoning, not generalizations extracted on
the basis of them. The fundamental difference between rule-based and example-based
approaches is that the former, because of the nature of rules, have to abstract from low-
frequency and untypical examples in order to formulate compact rules, whereas the
latter keep all information, exceptions, and noise included. This does not imply that the
work described in these papers is any less interesting, of course, but I would not nec-
essarily call it EBMT. Ilyas Cicekli and H. Altay G¨uvenir (“Learning Translation Tem-
plates from Bilingual Translation Examples”) show how translation templates can be
learned by means of a language-independent method for generalizing exemplars based
on similarities and differences. Ralf Brown (“Clustered Transfer Rule Induction for
Example-Based Translation”), meanwhile, adopts a similar approach to that used in the
previous chapter to learn translation templates and adds to that a bottom-up agglomer-
ative clustering method for both words and replacement rules. He shows that cluster-
ing and rule induction each outperform simple string matching and that the combina-
tion outperforms both. In chapter 11 (“Translation Patterns, Linguistic Knowledge and
Complexity in an Approach to EBMT”), Kevin McTait discusses a template extraction
based on similarity in distributions of strings in source and target language sentences
and fails to improve its accuracy significantly by adding morphological analysis and
POS tagging. Finishing Part III, Michael Carl (“Inducing Translation Grammars from
Bracketed Alignments”) presents a system that extracts lexical transfer rules and trans-
lation templates from a tagged and bracketed corpus, thereby effectively moving from
example-based reasoning to grammar induction. Interestingly, the induced grammar
has the desirable properties of homomorphy, invertibility, and compositionality.
Part IV moves even further away from example-based approaches in requiring
the extraction of translation grammars from structured representations (bilingual tree-
banks). Kaoru Yamamoto and Yuji Matsumoto, in chapter 13 (“Extracting Translation

Knowledge from Parallel Corpora”), report on two successful studies on extracting
translation knowledge from parallel automatically annotated corpora, with robust re-
sults even with the unavoidable annotation errors. They also show that chunk bound-
aries, especially, provide useful information for translation and that dependency re-
lations are crucial for longer phrasal translation pairs. Hideo Watanabe, Sadao Kuro-
hashi, and Eiji Aramaki (“Finding Translation Patterns from Paired Source and Target
Dependency Structures”) follow a similar approach but add a method for extract-
ing translation patterns by comparing correct and wrong translations, as a means
of enhancing a database of translation patterns. Arul Menezes and Stephen Richard-
son (“A Best-First Alignment Algorithm for Automatic Extraction of Transfer Map-
pings from Bilingual Corpora”) describe a logical-form alignment algorithm for the
Microsoft MSR-MT architecture. Andy Way, in the final chapter (“Translating with
Examples: The LFG-DOT Models of Translation”) describes various models based on
adapting data-oriented parsing (DOP, a memory-based parsing method) to transla-
tion using an LFG-parsed bilingual treebank; he shows how this approach solves
the problem of boundary friction (retrieved translations that do not fit the syntactic
context).
Although it is very clear that the book consists of a number of independent papers
and keeps some of the repetitive and overlapping flavor of a workshop proceedings
volume, the editors and authors have done an excellent job in making this a coherent
and self-contained book by adding cross-references and inviting additional papers. My
main, not very vital regret regarding the book is that although there is some reference to
relevant “lazy learning” techniques such as case-based, memory-based, and instance-
based learning in AI, few links are made to the application of these ideas in areas of
computational linguistics other than MT (ranging from case-based or memory-based
phonology to pragmatics). As an example, see the special issue of Journal of Experimen-
tal and Theoretical Artificial Intelligence that I edited several years ago (Daelemans 1999).
This work starts from the same inspiration as EBMT: Language-processing behavior is
best modeled as similarity-based reasoning on the basis of stored experiences rather
than as based on explicit rules extracted from these experiences. The motivation for
this assumption, which has considerable empirical support, is that language data con-
tain so many subregularities and exceptions that rules abstracting away from these
exceptional or infrequent cases are at a disadvantage. It is my (undoubtedly biased)
impression that this work sometimes goes a lot further than EBMT work in analyzing
deeper questions such as why these techniques are better suited for NLP tasks and
which task-independent similarity metrics and algorithms are best suited for solving
NLP tasks in this paradigm. There may be a chance for mutually beneficial interaction
here. In summary, I would recommend this book to everyone active or interested in
MT, and especially the papers of the foundational part I to computational linguistics
researchers in general.

Van Kuppevelt and Smith’s book offers a kind of archival proceedings for the Second
SIGdial Workshop, which was held in 2001 in conjunction with Eurospeech. SIGdial
is the Special Interest Group on Discourse and Dialogue of the Association for Com-
putational Linguistics, and its annual workshop series, always collocated with major
events in computational linguistics, has become a premier forum for empirical, for-
mal, and computational approaches to language use. I think the breadth and energy
of van Kuppevelt and Smith’s collection supports an unequivocal appraisal of these
meetings: If your interests touch on discourse and dialogue and your schedule and
budget permit, you should be attending them. The next one will be held once again
in conjunction with Eurospeech in September 2005 in Lisbon, Portugal. Go.
So should you buy this book? You might be worried about value. Inevitably,
Kluwer wants $167 from your library for the hardcover version. For that you get
12 revised versions of papers whose original versions are, in fact, archived in the ACL
anthology. But before you go spooling things off to the printer, Kluwer does have a
paperback version, on offer for a relatively modest $65. Most of the chapters offer sub-
stantial additions (typically an extra methodological section) and spell out annotation
standards, implementation techniques, or analytical results more thoroughly than the
workshop papers. The expanded versions go a long way toward making the individual
contributions more convincing and easier to replicate. In addition, the collection in-
cludes four invited new chapters, covering dialogue annotation, dialogue pragmatics,
dialogue semantics, and dialogue system implementation. With all this new content,
I wouldn’t have hesitated to order the book for myself.
You might also be worried about the relevance of papers from a workshop from
three years ago. In fact, the volume is as selective as any conference proceedings; van
Kuppevelt and Smith report that the 12 contributed papers were winnowed down
from 57 submissions to the workshop. However, rather than trying to present a concise
and self-contained nugget of completed research, many of the most interesting papers
articulate and motivate ambitious long-term agendas for dialogue research. The term
directions in the book’s title is thus faithful to its contents. The collection retains interest
because it retains the adventurous and open-ended feel of a successful workshop and
emphasizes these forward-looking characterizations of central problems and methods
in the field. You can still use this book as a worthwhile jumping-off point for framing
grant proposals or designing a graduate seminar in discourse and dialogue.

Three (invited) chapters nicely illustrate this flavor in the collection. All three
chapters start from successful accounts of the dynamics of collaborative planning
(Lochbaum 1998; Chu-Carroll and Carberry 2000), and take up the question of how
such dynamics might be mediated by people’s and systems’ utterances. Jonathan
Ginzburg uses corpus analysis to argue that the public contribution of an utterance
follows closely from its semantics and is sharply distinguished from the speaker’s
more general implicatures and motives. While interlocutors’ motives are always avail-
able as a metalevel topic of conversation, Ginzburg shows, only utterance content is
at play in the fine-grained dynamics of clarification and grounding that allows inter-
locutors to achieve mutual understanding. This compelling new argument suggests
that collaborative dialogue systems must signal their intentions publicly, directly in
the content of their utterances. This is a challenge to semantics, as we must now rep-
resent such content in the “logical form” of discourse, perhaps along the lines being
developed by Asher and Lascarides (2003). At the same time, Ginzburg’s argument
helps us to appreciate the conversational work that dialogue systems can do off the
record, where the strategies dialogue agents use, such as indirection and politeness,
can foster relationships with and trust among users (Bickmore 2003).
In another chapter, David Traum and Staffan Larsson survey their information-
state approach to dialogue management. In essence, this approach offers a general
knowledge representation methodology for use in characterizing dialogue context. It
invites the designer to identify the meaningful distinctions in dialogue state that par-
ticipants need to keep track of and to describe declaratively how utterances change it.
Traum and Larsson’s chapter recapitulates their earlier overview of the approach and
survey of information-state systems (Larsson and Traum 2000) while clarifying their
contribution to the design of reusable and sharable dialogue components. Although
the chapter remains important, it might have been more instructive with a longer ex-
planation of how and why to use the approach, as the approach continues to prove
itself across an increasingly broad range of communicative behavior (Nakano et al.
2003) and increasingly varied interactions among communicators (Traum et al. 2003).
Lastly, Nate Blaylock, James Allen, and George Ferguson work to refine the moves
of existing collaborative problem-solving models to the level of precision required to
describe individual utterances in natural conversation. They build on previous models
in factoring the course of collaboration into primitive joint steps, such as agreeing to
adopt an action into a plan. (Their steps are particularly flexible because they draw
on a somewhat formidable ontology to systematize the ingredients of collaborative
planning and collaborative action.) They go on to characterize utterances by linking
them with abstract communicative moves that specify one agent’s contribution to one
of these joint steps, such as initiating or completing one. Perhaps the most substantial
insight here is that collaborative dialogues in dynamic domains play out differently
because they must interleave planning and action. This is an increasingly important
feature of current system domains from search-and-rescue to home automation. There
is no going back. However, to go forward, we still need to regiment these collabo-
rative moves to derive principled representations for agents’ mental states, mutual
commitments, and meanings—offering ample space for future research.
Obviously, an important theme of the collection is the interrelationships among
human behavior, theoretical explanations, and system design. Two other themes of
the volume deserve mention here as enduring inspiration for ongoing research in dis-
course and dialogue. The first theme is the challenge and promise of data annotation.
For example, in the remaining invited chapter, Niels Ole Bernsen, Laila Dybkjær, and
Mykola Kolodnytsky outline the requirements for annotation tools aimed at captur-
ing the complexity of face-to-face conversation. As they outline, an ideal platform

would accommodate a range of users and uses and would support the analysis of
communicative behaviors, including all aspects of their structure and interpretation,
across all available modalities. This general vision, well-articulated here in one spe-
cific formulation, continues to set the agenda for tools and resources in projects like
TalkBank (MacWhinney et al. 2004). Similarly, Lynn Carlson, Daniel Marcu, and Mary
Ellen Okurowski document their work to create a corpus of discourse annotated with
hierarchical interpreted structure in the framework of rhetorical structure theory. A set
of case studies (new since the workshop submission) draw on their corpus to explore
and characterize various levels of discourse: the uses of individual connectives within
sentences, the expression of parallels and contrasts across multiple sentences, and the
organization of documents as a whole. Annotated discourse corpora continue to be
developed (Miltsakaki et al. 2004), so these strategies for mining and visualizing them
will surely continue to inform their use.
The other theme is rapid development of dialogue applications. Two chapters in
particular, one by Hiyan Alshawi and Shona Douglas, the other by Manny Rayner,
Johan Boye, Ian Lewin, and Genevieve Gorrell (both slight revisions of original work-
shop papers), frame the issues in crisply insightful ways. Useful dialogue applications
link domain-independent words and constructions with domain-specific responses.
Configuring a dialogue system therefore requires specifications that crosscut tradi-
tional units of system design, such as grammatical resources and domain-general and
domain-specific interpretive procedures. Building these specifications remains a com-
plex task requiring enormous expertise. Rayner and colleagues aim to simplify these
specifications by describing a “plug and play” architecture. System components are
described in terms of their domain functionality. At the same time, they are linked
with predefined hierarchical collections of linguistic resources that encapsulate the in-
terface for that functionality. With these tools, new components can be characterized
by compact specifications that can be integrated seamlessly and elegantly with an
existing system. Alshawi and Douglas, by contrast, aim to learn these specifications.
They start from examples pairing utterances with their domain-specific interpretations.
They reconstruct the interpretation for a new utterance by directly manipulating the
interpretation of a similar utterance drawn from this sample set. It testifies to the ex-
citement of dialogue research that the basic problem of linking language to a world
model admits such divergent approaches. Indeed, these approaches represent extremes
of a huge design space, with alternative delineations of tasks and resources and with
different demarcations between what to specify by hand, what to capture directly
from data, and what to learn from annotation. This space remains an inspiration for
dialogue research, including some of my own, for example (Stone et al. 2004).
Van Kuppevelt and Smith have put together an inclusive, timely, and significant
collection. The book has small flaws—notably a few glitches in the typesetting of
tables and of references in running text—but I find that my most severe criticism of it
is simply that it is a book. In many respects, the closest parallel to it would be an issue
of AI Magazine or Communications of the ACM: a selective forum with a broad audience
for exciting, programmatic but precise discussion of important trends in research. This
collection made me wonder whether, with its proliferation of lively SIGs and far-flung
meetings, ACL might deserve an analogous series.

Since the mathematical properties of interest to mathematical linguists are usually from theoretical computer science (complexity classes, language hierarchies, formal learnability), mathematical linguistics can be considered to be an area of theoretical computational linguistics. However, since statistical methods are rarely used in mathematical linguistics, its relationship to current practices in computational linguistics is somewhat limited.</abstract>

At this point, the classical introduction to this area is still Partee, ter Meulen, and Wall (1990). Kracht’s book is significantly more advanced; in fact, a good working knowledge of Partee et al. is a prerequisite to Kracht’s book. The Handbook of Logic and Language (van Benthem and ter Meulen 1997), which contains advanced material in this area, is much more focused on semantics than Kracht’s book. Compared to introductory (e.g., Hopcroft and Ullman 1979) or advanced (e.g., Mart´ın-Vide, Mitrana, and P˘aun 2004) books on formal language theory, Kracht’s book emphasizes those aspects of formal language theory that are relevant to the study of natural languages, whereas the former do not. Thus, Kracht’s book gives a uniform introduction, which currently does not exist at this level, to an important area of mathematical linguistics. Its main use will be in advanced graduate courses and for researchers interested in learning about mathematical linguistics.

Another strength of this book is that it introduces logical tools incrementally together with the application for which they are needed. This reinforces the central role that logic plays in mathematical linguistics and makes it possible to read the book as an introduction to applied logic. There are some minor inconsistencies. For instance, indexed grammars are introduced in the chapter on PTIME languages, and it is claimed that languages generated by indexed grammars can be parsed in PTIME, even though the recognition problem for indexed grammars is known to be NP-complete (Rounds 1973). The chapter on semantics is a little too brief. Given the length of the book, it is understandable that no more space could be dedicated to it; however, it might have been more productive to replace that material with a more detailed description of formal models of GB, since this is an area in which Kracht has obtained many important results. Computational linguists will probably feel that parsing is not discussed in enough detail. While chart parsing is discussed for context-free grammars, a large number of papers on parsing of mildly context-sensitive grammars can be found in conference pr</context>
