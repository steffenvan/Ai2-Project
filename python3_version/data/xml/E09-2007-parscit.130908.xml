Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.9998896">
We compare the phenomena of clausal coor-
dinate ellipsis in Estonian, a Finno-Ugric lan-
guage, and German, an Indo-European lan-
guage. The rules underlying these phenomena
appear to be remarkably similar. Thus, the
software module ELLEIPO, which was origi-
nally developed to generate clausal coordi-
nate ellipsis in German and Dutch, works for
Estonian as well. In order to extend
ELLEIPO’s coverage to Estonian, we only had
to adapt the lexicon and some syntax rules
unrelated to coordination. We describe the
language-independent rules for coordinate el-
lipsis that ELLEIPO applies to non-elliptical
syntactic structures in both target languages.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.7538047">
In written German newspaper text, clausal coor-
dination occurs in about 14% of the sentences,
and coordinate ellipsis (e.g. (1)) in about 7% (see
a corpus study by Harbusch and Kempen, 2007).
Studies of ellipsis in Estonian are hardly avail-
able (cf. Erelt, 2003).

<bodyText confidence="0.998851787878788">
In order to deal with these relatively frequent
phenomena, we develop an Estonian coordinate-
ellipsis generator based on ELLEIPO, the software
module written in JAVA that generates clausal
coordinate ellipsis in German and Dutch (Har-
busch and Kempen, 2006; 2009). Given the fact
that the two target languages belong to two rather
different language families (German is an Indo-
European, Estonian a Finno-Ugric language) we
expected the two target languages to differ con-
siderably with respect to the rules for generating
coordinate elisions; however, this expectation
was falsified. As we will detail below, a pairwise
comparison of a heterogeneous set of elliptical
constructions in the target languages reveals that
the German rules we had implemented in
ELLEIPO also generate the Estonian structures.
We only needed to adapt the lexicon and some
syntax rules unrelated to coordination. The core
algorithm worked language-independently for
both languages.
The paper is organized as follows. In section
2, we first define the four main groups of clausal
coordinate ellipsis phenomena, and show that the
elisions in the two target languages obey basi-
cally the same rules. This implies that the Esto-
nian version of the software system ELLEIPO can
use the same core algorithm as the German and
Dutch version. In section 3, we discuss other lin-
guistic theories for clausal coordinate ellipsis,
especially focussing on implementations for gen-
eration. In final section 4, we draw some conclu-
sions and address options for future work.

1 We will not deal with the elliptical constructions known as
VP Ellipsis, VP Anaphora and Pseudogapping because they
involve the generation of pro-forms instead of, or in addi-
tion to, the ellipsis proper. For example, John laughed, and
Mary did, too—a case of VP Ellipsis—includes the pro-
form did. Nor do we deal with recasts of clausal coordina-
tions as coordinate NPs (e.g., John likes skating and Peter
likes skiing becoming John and Peter like skating and ski-
ing, respectively). Presumably, such conversions involve a
logical rather than syntactic mechanism.

In the theoretical framework by Kempen
(2009) and its implementation for German and
Dutch in ELLEIPO, the elision process is guided
by constraints on lemma- and wordform-identity
constraints and, to some extent, linear order.2
ELLEIPO’s functioning is based on the as-
sumption that coordinate ellipsis does not result
from the application of declarative grammar
rules for clause formation but from a procedural
component that interacts with the sentence gen-
erator and may block the overt expression of cer-
tain constituents. Thus, the rules apply to assem-
bled non-elliptical (unreduced) tree structures in
the final stage of generation. Due to this feature,
ELLEIPO can be combined, at least in principle,
with various lexicalized-grammar formalisms.
However, this advantage does not come entirely
for free: The module needs a formalism-
dependent interface that converts generator out-
put to a canonical form consisting of “flat” syn-
tactic trees where all major clause constituents
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.854721666666667">
2 Coordinate structures consist of two or more conjuncts
connected by a coordinating conjunction (in our exam-
ples: and). Rules of coordinate ellipsis license elision of
some consituent in one conjunct under “identity” with a
constituent in another conjunct. We distinguish between
lemma identity, where only the word-stems of the constitu-
ents have to be identical, and wordform identity, which re-
quires not only identity of the stems but also of their mor-
phological features. Gapping only requires lemma identity
(cf. examples (2) and (4)). In FCR, word-form identity is
checked, i.e. the identical word string referring to the same
referent (cf. *The boy loves dogs and [the boys]f hate cats).
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.998927625">
are represented at the same hierarchical level
(see Harbusch and Kempen 2006; 2007).
In the following, we introduce ELLEIPO’s eli-
sion rules only in an informal manner (for the
pseudocode of the algorithm, see Harbusch and
Kempen, 2006; 2009). The rules described in the
following can be applied in any order to unre-
duced syntactic structures in canonical form. In
case of a successful rule application, the elidable
constituents (and its non-elided counterpart in the
other conjunct) is adorned with a subscript indi-
cating the ellipsis type (as illustrated in (2)
through (8)). ELLEIPO’s final step executes all
possible elliptical combinations (e.g., for exam-
ple (1), it also realizes a version with Subgapping
and LDG, respectively, i.e.: Monopole sollen
geknackt werden und MŠrkte solleng getrennt
werdengg).
In Gapping (see examples (9) and (10)),
lemma-identical verbs can be elided from the
second conjunct, if and only if a contrast is ex-
pressed, i.e. each remaining constituent in this
conjunct has a counterpart with the same gram-
matical function in the first conjunct (cf. (11)).3

In Long-Distance Gapping (LDG), the rem-

rior counterparts belong to different clauses. My
wife in (12) (translation of (3)) belongs to the
main clause whereas a car is part of the infini-
tival complement clause. Notice that LDG does
not require adjacency of the elided verbs (cf. the
German example in (12)).

order variation (both Estonian and German are languages
with relatively free word order). For the same reason, we
only discuss examples with two conjuncts (although,
ELLEIPO analyses n-ary coordinations as well), and cannot
pay attention to coordinate structures that include negation.

In Forward-Conjunction Reduction (FCR), a
left-peripheral string of major constituents in the
right conjunct is elided under wordform-identity
with its counterpart in the right conjunct. In FCR
example (15), the left-peripheral string compris-
ing complementizer, subject and direct object are
elided from the right-hand conjunct. If modifiers
that are neither lemma- nor wordform-identical,
are placed in between subject and object—as in
(16)—, then elision of the object is blocked. (Ac-
tually, example (16) is not ill-formed but its
right-hand conjunct cannot be interpreted as
cleaning the bike.) In main-clause variant (17),
elision of the direct object is blocked for similar
reasons.

Backward-Conjunction Reduction (BCR) li-
censes elision of a right-peripheral string in the
left-hand conjunct under lemma-identity4 with its
counterpart in the right conjunct. However, un-
like FCR’s mirror image, BCR may cut into ma-
jor constituents of the clause. In BCR example
(18), the direct object can be elided in the first
conjunct whereas in word-order variant (19), the
verb blocks this elision. Example (20) illustrates
that BCR, unlike the three other ellipsis types,
may cut into major clausal constituents and only

Examples (21)-(23) embody word-order vari-
ants within two simple coordinated clauses. The
(il)licit elision patterns verify that in BCR the

conjunct, whereas in FCR the ellipsis is located
left-peripherally in the right-hand conjunct.

SGF (Subject Gap in clauses with Fi-

of the right conjunct if in the left conjunct the
subject follows the verb; however, the first con-
stituent of the unreduced right-hand clausal con-
junct must meet certain special requirements. In
particular, it should be the subject of this clause
(as in (24), translation of (8)) or a modifier (25),
but not an argument other than the subject, e.g.
neither complement nor (in)direct object (26).
Additionally, if FCR is also possible, it should
actually be realized in order to license SGF (for
additional discussion of these restrictions, see
Harbusch and Kempen, 2009).

Given the similarities between the rules that
appear to control clausal coordinate ellipsis in
German and Estonian, it is not surprising that
the German/Dutch version of ELLEIPO could be
tailored to Estonian easily. ELLEIPO’s language-
independent core algorithm generates Estonian
ellipsis as well, as shown by the demonstrator.
For the sake of completeness, we should add
here that we have not been able to find types of
clausal coordinate ellipsis in Estonian that go
beyond the above four types; hence, as far as we
can tell, Estonian does not require additional
rules over and above those we needed for Ger-
man and Dutch.

3 State of the art in ellipsis generation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999943842105263">
All major grammar formalisms provide rules for
clausal coordinate ellipsis—rules that tend to be
intertwined with rules for nonelliptical coordina-
tion (e.g. Sarkar and Joshi (1996) for Tree Ad-
joining Grammar; Steedman (2000) for Combi-
natory Categorial Grammar; Frank (2002) for
Functional Grammar; Crysman (2003) and Bea-
vers and Sag (2004) for HPSG; and te Velde
(2006) for the Minimalist Program). This also
applies to many NLG systems (cf. Reiter and
Dale, 2000). Generators that do include an
autonomous component for coordinate ellipsis—
that is, a component that takes unreduced coordi-
nations expressed in the system’s grammar for-
malism as input and return elliptical versions as
output (Shaw, 1998; Dalianis, 1999; Hielkema,
2005)—use incomplete rule sets, thus risking
over- or undergeneration, and incorrect or un-
natural output.

4 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999970384615384">
Finally, we do not expect that the four types of
clausal coordinate ellipsis presented here are
“universal” in the sense that all natural languages
exhibit all four of them and no language has ad-
ditional types (see Harbusch and Kempen 2009
for some discussion based on language-
typological work by Haspelmath, 2007). How-
ever, the experience described in this paper
makes us confident that the ”modular” approach
taken in the ELLEIPO project will prove efficient
when it comes to writing coordinate ellipsis rules
for other languages—especially for languages
belonging other language families.

We distinguish between lemma identity, where only the word-stems of the constituents have to be identical, and wordform identity, which requires not only identity of the stems but also of their morphological features. Gapping only requires lemma identity (cf. examples (2) and (4)). In FCR, word-form identity is checked, i.e. the identical word string referring to the same referent (cf. *The boy loves dogs and [the boys]f hate cats). are represented at the same hierarchical level (see Harbusch and Kempen 2006; 2007). In the following, we introduce ELLEIPO’s elision rules only in an informal manner (for the pseudocode of the algorithm, see Harbusch and Kempen, 2006; 2009). The rules described in the following can be applied in any order to unreduced syntactic structures in canonical form. In case of a successful rule application, the elidable constituents (and its non-elided counterpart in the other conjunct) is adorned with a subscript indicating the ellipsis type (as illustrated in (2) through (8)).
