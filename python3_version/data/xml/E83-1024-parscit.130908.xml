This paper presents a syntactical
method of interpreting pronouns in Polish.
Using the surface structure of the sentence
as well as grammatical and inflexional
information accessible during syntactic
analysis, an area of reference is marked out
for each personal and possessive pronoun.
This area consists of a few internal areas
inside the current sentence and an external
area i.e. the part of the text preceding it.
In order to determine that area of reference
several syntactic sentence-level restrictions
on anaphora interpretation are formulated.
Next, when looking at the area of
pronoun&apos;s reference, all NPs which number-
-gender agree with the pronoun can be
selected and this way the set of surface
referents of each pronoun can be created.
It can be used as data for further semantic
analysis.

INTRODUCTION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9254374">
Reference is one of the central
concepts of any linguistic theory. In recent
research into anaphora the term &amp;quot;reference&amp;quot;
has been used in three different senses
(Szwedek, 1981):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.754626571428571">
(a) as a relation between the name and the
thing named (Hall Partee, 1978)
(b) as an association between noun phrases
and mental entities in the language user&apos;s
(Nash- lV ebber, 1978)
(c) as an association between the occurrence
of phrases in the text (Reinhart, 1981)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.986337888888889">
However the reference is understood,
in order to interpret correctly anaphora on the
semantic level ( (a) and (b)), first a stage
(c) is necessary.
In this paper I he.ve taken the point of
view presented under (c). I shall discuss the
problem of anaphora in Polish sentences. My
attention is focused on personal and
possessive pronouns explicitely occurring in
the text and moreover on zero pronouns, i.e.
ellipsis of NP in the subject position, specific
for Slavonic languages.
My purpose in the description of
regularities of the reference in the Polish
language. I shall express them by defining the
area of pronoun&apos;s references, i.e. those regions
of the text where its antecedents should be
found. These surface referents will be selected
from among NPs occurring in the sentence.
&apos;The research on anaphora made for
English has led to the formulation of some
structural rules using such relations as
command, c-command and precede-and-command
(Reinhart, 1981).
I have been searching for analogous rules
for Polish. But two essential differences have
to be considered:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.932074333333333">
(i) grammatical and morphological properties
of Polish and English;
(ii) different grammatical traditions.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.973329740740741">
Por English the rules concernig the
coreference of entities were formulated on the
basis of generative-transformational grammar.
For Polish the first precise description of
Polish syntax was formulated only recently by
Szpakowicz, who based his work on the
framework created by Saloni (Saloni, 1976;
Saloni and Swicizinski, 1981). It is a kind of
immediate-constituent grammar; the grammatical
categories (case, gender, etc) are applied not
only to single words, but also to compound
phrases. In my present work I have limited my
attention to the subset of Polish described
by Szpakowicz (Szpakowicz, 1983).
Polish is a highly inflexional language and
this fact has many and varied consequences.
Surface referents of the pronoun will be
selected from among those NPs which number-
-gender agree with the pronoun. Strictly
speaking, the grammatical categories of the
pronoun should be compatible with the
categories of the NP, but in cases of
neutralization they cannot be fully determined.
My method of determining the areas of pronoun&apos;s
reference is a syntactic one, because it is
based on morphological and syntactical
properties of the Polish language. I assume
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.99995975">
the availability of the surface structure of the
sentence as well as grammatical and inflexional
information accessible during a syntactic
analysis. I deliberately do not make use of
any semantic information, trying to get the
most out of grammar. The feature I intend to
provide is a complete definition of the area
of pronoun&apos;s reference.

II AREA OF REFERENCE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998223384615385">
A. Internal and external areas of reference
In the process of determining the surface
referents of the pronoun, first the area of its
reference should be marked out. This area,
i.e. those regions of the text, where its
antecedents should be found, is usually made
up of several internal reference areas, i.e.
the appropriate bits of the current sentence,
and an external area the part of the text
preceding the current sentence. The list of
internal areas depends on the syntactic
position of the pronoun in the sentence.
To determine these areas it is necessary to
formulate sentence-level anaphora restrictions
for Polish; These rules will determine the
conditions of both obligatory coreference and
obligatory non-coreference of entities. Thus
we have two situations to consider:
(i) in the case of obligatory coreference one
internal area of reference containing the
appropriate referent should be marked
out; -
(a) in the case of obligatory non-coreference
the elements which are forbidden as
surface referents of the pronoun should
be excluded from the internal area.
The coreference of entities which is qualified
on the basis of some other premises will be
called admissible coreference.
At our disposal we have a multileveled,
hierarchic surface structure of the sentence,
Generally, it seems that internal areas can be
identified with the constituents on the highest
level: subject, objects, modifiers, regardless
of their syntactic realization. Strictly speaking,
noun as well as NP or any sentential
structures can be instances of internal areas
of reference.
The partitioning of sentence (1) illustrates it:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9647">
(1) &amp;quot;(Ewa i Piotr) poszli (do niego)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.92414043902439">
(z dziewczyna, ktora wranie spotkali)&amp;quot;.
&amp;quot;Eva and Peter went to him with a girl
which just rr et&amp;quot;.
13. Rules ccncerning coreference of
entities in Polish
1. The basic criterion of excluding
coreference
The following rules of excluding the
coreference of entities concern a level
deeper than that on the surface, because they
refer to syntactical functions of phrases in the
sentence. The first rule presents the problem
of coreference of the subject and other nominal
groups, i.e. objects and nominal modifiers, in
short called objects. It concerns reflexive
pronouns, so it should be noted first that they
differ from those in English, eg.:
- possessive pronoun &amp;quot;swor may have one of
the following meanings: his, her, its.
- reflexive pronoun &amp;quot;siebie&amp;quot; can mean: himself,
herself, itself, myself, ourself, yourself,
themselves.
The basic criterion of excluding
corference I have formulated from the
analytical point of view:
(R 1) If the object is expressed by means of
a reflexive pronoun, then it is
coreferential with the subject; in other
cases the referential identity of the
subject and object ist excluded.
This criterion is applied both to look for
coreferents of objects - blocking the subject,
and in testing the possible antecedents of the
subject - blocking the objects.
Let us consider some examples:
Meaning of symbols:
obligatory coreference
obligatory non-coreference
admissible coreference
reference to external area
zero pronoun
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.887772928571429">
(2) &amp;quot;Ewa zapytala j o to&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;Eva asked her about it&amp;quot;
(3) &amp;quot;51 zapytata j o to&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;Asked her about it&amp;quot;
tem
(4) &amp;quot;Ona zapytata j o to&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;She asked her about it&amp;quot;
(5) 1.0n zapyta/ Jana o Piotra&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;He asked John about Peter&amp;quot;
(6) &amp;quot;Piotr nalat sobie piwe.&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;Peter poured himself beer&amp;quot;
Rule R 1 holds for possessive pronouns:
(7) &amp;quot;Ewa uwielbia swoj przyjaci6tke
•
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.847634857142857">
&amp;quot;Eva adores her friend&amp;quot;
Now let us have a look • at the case of the
preposed PPs so difficult to interpret in
English. The basic criterion of excluding
coreference covers these phrases too:
(8) &amp;quot;Nagle, obok Jana, 95 zobaczyt wqZa&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;Suddenly, near John, savr/lasc a snake&amp;quot;
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.902591">

</page>
<listItem confidence="0.831686857142857">
(9) &amp;quot;Nagle, obok niego, zobaczyt weia&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;Suddenly, near him, saw a snake&amp;quot;
# masc
(10) &amp;quot;Nagle, obok siebie, zobaczyt weZa&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;Suddenly, near himself, saw a snake&amp;quot;
masc
(11) &amp;quot;Nagle, obok siebie, on zobaczyt weZa&amp;quot;
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.960515772727273">
&amp;quot;Suddenly, near himself, he saw a snake&amp;quot;
In examples (10) and (11) the reflexive
pronoun has appeared. These are the only
two cases in which the coreference with the
subject of the main sentence is permitted and
even obligatory. Such an interpretation is
correct irrespective of the position of PP in
the sentence, i.e. it does not depend on
whether this phrase precedes or follows the
subject.
The basic criterion of excluding
coreference works as follows:
( 1 ) it is valid only for a simple clause,
without blocking coreference between the
elements of the main sentence and the
constituents of embedded clauses;
(ii) it is obligatory on every level of the
sentence, i.e. it concerns all the
sentence constructions irrespective of
their position in the structure of the
whole sentence.
Examples (12) to (14) illustrate this:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.75879175">
(12) &amp;quot;Piotr nie wiedziat, czy.-93 pOjdzie do
kina&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;Peter did not know, whether would go
to the movies&amp;quot;

(13) &amp;quot;Jan zapomniat, o co Piot_r gp pytat&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;John forgot, what Peter asked him about&amp;quot;
(14) &amp;quot;Jan spotkat chlopca, ktory go, dawno

<bodyText confidence="0.932543357142857">
.
nie odwiedm-t„ —
&amp;quot;John met a boy, who didn&apos;t visit him
for long”
The interpretation of reflexive pronouns
is not so easy as the criterion R 1 suggests.
These pronouns can be involved in various
compound phrases which often are ambiguous.
Especially infinitive phrases are hard to
interpret. In order to do this correctly, an
implicit agent which will be called further the
deep subject, should be obtained. It often
needs a few hypotheses to be formulated.
Let us consider an example. The sentence:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.689458">
(15) &amp;quot;Jan kazat stuZa,cemu umya sie&amp;quot;
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.719479">
can be translated in two ways which exactly
give the sense of possible Polish
interpretations:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.905223333333333">
(15.1) &amp;quot;John told (the sevant) (to wash him)&amp;quot;
(15.2) &amp;quot;John told (the servant) (to wash
himself)&amp;quot;
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998891">
In the infinitive phrase &amp;quot;umy6 sie&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;to wash
him&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;to wash himself&amp;quot;) which is standing
in the object position, the reflexive pronoun
&amp;quot;sie&amp;quot; is coreferential with the deep subject of
this phrase. Thus its interpretation has to be
determined. Here we have two :possibilities:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.7093175">
(i) the pre-vioux object - &amp;quot;servant&amp;quot; -
interpretation (15.1)
(ii) the subject of the main sentence - &amp;quot;John&amp;quot;
- interpretation (15.2)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9052328125">
One of them is the referent of the deep
subject. And so we come to the next rule:
(R 2) In order to interpret the infinitive
phrase, the deep subject of the phrase
has to be selected from among the
previous object (if any) and the
subject of the main sentence.
2. Excluding the coreference between
objects
The next sentence-level restriction of
anaphora interpretation regulates the problem
of coreference of NPs other than a subject,
i.e. objects, between them.
(R 3) The coreference of particular objets
is excluded. This in an obligatory
non-coreference.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.932942">
(16) &amp;quot;Jan zapyta g o Piotra&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;John asked him about Peter&amp;quot;
(17) &amp;quot;Jan zapytat o nieao&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;John aske&amp;quot;Fijm about him&amp;quot;
(18) &amp;quot;Jan zapytat Piotra o nieao&amp;quot;
—z,
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.870757083333333">
&amp;quot;John asked Peter about him&amp;quot;
This rule does not hold for possessive
pronouns which in Polish do not create NPs
by themselves. If these pronouns occur in
objects, they may be coreferential with objects
preceding them (admissible coreference).
(19) &amp;quot;Jan zapytat Piotra o iego brats&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;John asked Peter about his brother&amp;quot;
Rule R 2 is only valid for a simple clause,
but it concerns all the sentence constructions
irrespective of their position in the whole
sentence.

3. Rules of interpreting compound
sentences
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994622939393939">
The next group of problems concerns
the coreference of entities in a compound
sentence, including the question of the subject.
In a Polish sentence it needs not be explicit.
Ellipsis of the NP in the subject position,
often called &amp;quot;the elided subject&amp;quot;, is a natural
way of expressing &amp;quot;thematic continuity&amp;quot; and
exemplifies an unaccented position in the
sentence. On the other hand, the pronoun as
the subject stands in syntactic opposition to
the elided subject (zero pronoun) and
exemplifies an accented position in the
sentence.
While determining the antecedent of the
subject of a simple sentence or a main clause
in a compound sentence (explicit or implicit)
we reach out to the external area of
references. However, the basic criterion of
excluding coreference is still valid.
(20) &amp;quot;On zapytat o Moira,&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;He asked trim about Peter&amp;quot;
The interpretation of compound sentences is
dificult and sometimes leads to ambiguous
results. The following rules concern mainly the
coreference (or non-coreference) of elided
subjects in co-ordinate and aubordinate
clauses. In the case of co-ordinate clauses
two rules can be formulated:
(R 4) For each two clauses in a sequence,
if the elided subject is in the second
clause, then the subject of the first
clause should be extrapolated there
(obligatory coreference).
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.875704166666667">
(21) &amp;quot;Piotr wstat od stot-77-10pociszedt do okna!&apos;

<bodyText confidence="0.947755826086957">
&amp;quot;Because forgot
masc masc
(R 7) The elided subject in the embedded
clause is a natural way of indicating
the nearest candidate - the previous
object (if it is there) or the subject
of the main sentence (admissible
coreference).
..■■•
(25) &amp;quot;Jan dra-pewnit Piotra, Ze&apos;sh0 p6jdzie do
kina&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;John promised Peter, that will go to
the movies&amp;quot;
(R 8) The pronoun or zero pronoun subject
in the main sentence can be
coreferential with the non-pronoun
subject of the embedded clause which
precedes the main sentence (admissible
coreference), but cannot be
coreferential with the non-pronoun
subject of the embedded clause
following the main sentence(obligatory
non-coreference).

4. Interpretation of relative clauses
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.991662892857143">
Relative clauses are quite easy to
interpret in Polish. Either their subject or
object is replaced with pronoun &amp;quot;which&amp;quot; or
&amp;quot;what&amp;quot; or their equivalents (only such types
of relative clauses are described in the
Szpakowicz grammar). These pronouns
always indicate the NP next to which they
stand and inherit gender, number and person
from it. Thus the obligatory coreference of
relative pronoun and this NP is determined.
Let us have a look at some examples:
on
(29) &amp;quot;Elia zaprosita Anie,IstcirLa. znala od
dawna&amp;quot;
(R 5) For each two clauses in a sequence,
the pronoun or zero pronoun subject
in the first clause cannot be
coreferential with the non-pronoun
subject of the second clause
(obligatory non-coreference).
(22) &amp;quot;co wstat od stotu, aPiotr podszedt do
okna&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;He left the table and Peter approached
the window&amp;quot;
(R 6) If the embedded clause precedes the &amp;quot;Eva invited Ann which had known
main clause and if both have elided (object) fern
subjects, these have to be coreferential for long&amp;quot;
(obligatory coreference).

III CONCLUSION
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.999968361111111">
The above syntactic method of
interpreting pronouns yields only partial results
- the list of internal areas of reference or the
external area, both with certain restrictions on
coreference, are determined. Next, more
detailed results can be obtained. When looking
at the internal areas, all NPs which number-
-gender agree with the pronoun should be
selected and a list of surface referents of
pronoun together with a list of elements
blocked as the referents can be drawn up.
If no internal areas are marked out, the
external area with the list of blocked elements
is the result of the method presented here.
Similary, while only admissible coreference is
determined, the external area is marked out
too and the list of blocked elements remains
valid. On the other hand the obligatory
coreference makes it possible to define the
appropriate antecedent of the pronoun. The
list of surface referents may be ordered by
assuming the specific method of traversing the
parsing tree. I expext, that as for English,
recency understood as a physical distance
between the pronoun and its antecedent can be
the first approximation of the probability.
As expected the results of the method
applied here need semantic verification. But at
the same time they are a reasonable data for
further semantic analysis. Data arrived at in
this way make this process much easier.
It seems that a similar procedure can
be carried out for other languages. Full
grammatical information should be used
wherever it can simplify such complex
process as the semantic analysis.
