Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999893538461539">
Texts exhibit subtle yet identifiable mo-
dality about writers’ estimation of how
true each statement is (e.g., definitely true
or somewhat true). This study is an analy-
sis of such explicit certainty and doubt
markers in epistemically modalized
statements for a written news discourse.
The study systematically accounts for five
levels of writer’s certainty (ABSOLUTE,
HIGH, MODERATE, LOW CERTAINTY and
UNCERTAINTY) in three news pragmatic
contexts: perspective, focus, and time.
The study concludes that independent
coders’ perceptions of the boundaries be-
tween shades of certainty in epistemically
modalized statements are highly subjec-
tive and present difficulties for manual
annotation and consequent automation for
opinion extraction and sentiment analysis.
While stricter annotation instructions and
longer coder training can improve inter-
coder agreement results, it is not entirely
clear that a five-level distinction of cer-
tainty is preferable to a simplistic distinc-
tion between statements with certainty
and statements with doubt.

1.1 Epistemic Modality, or Certainty
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999944906976744">
Text conveys more than just a writer’s proposi-
tional context of assertions (Coates, 1987), e.g., X
is true. Text can also transfer the writers’ attitudes
to the propositions, assessments of possibilities,
and the writer’s certainty, or lack thereof, in the
validity of the truth of the statements, e.g., X must
be true, Y thinks that X is true, or perhaps X is
true. A statement is qualified in such a way (be-
yond its mere referential function) is modal, or
epistemically modalized (Coates, 1987; Westney,
1986).
CERTAINTY, or EPISTEMIC MODALITY, concerns
a linguistic expression of an estimation of the like-
lihood that a certain state of affairs is, has been, or
will be true (Nuyts, 2001). Pragmatic and dis-
course literatures are abundant in discussions of
epistemic modality (Coates, 1987; Nuyts, 2001);
mood (Palmer, 1986); evidentiality and evidentials
(Mushin, 2001); expressions of doubt and certainty
(Holmes, 1982; Hoye, 1997) and hedging
(Lackoff, 1972) and hedging in news writing
(Hyland, 1999; Zuck &amp; Zuck, 1986). Little at-
tempt, however, has been made in natural language
computing literature to manually annotate and con-
sequently automate identification of statements
with an explicitly expressed certainty or doubt, or
shades of epistemic qualifications in between. This
lack is possibly due to the complexity of comput-
ing epistemic interpretations in different pragmatic
contexts; and due to unreliability of variety of lin-
guistic expressions in English that could explicitly
qualify a statement. Another complication is a lack
of agreed-upon and easily identifiable discrete
categories on the continuum from certainty to
doubt. Several annotation projects have success-
fully addressed closely related subjective issues
such as private states in news writing (Wiebe, Wil-
son, &amp; Cardie, 2005) and hedging in scientific
writing (Light, Qiu, &amp; Srinivasan, 2004; Mercer,
DiMarco, &amp; Kroon, 2004). Having access to the
opinion holder’s evaluation of how true a state-
ment is valuable in predicting reliability of argu-
ments and claims, and stands to benefit the tasks of

1.2 Certainty Level Scales
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999873076923077">
While there is an on-going discussion in pragmatic
literature on whether epistemic modality markers
should be arranged on a continuum or in discrete
categories, there seems to be an agreement that
there are at least three articulated points on a pre-
sumed continuum from certainty to doubt. Hoye
(1997) suggested an epistemic trichotomy of CER-
TAINTY, PROBABILITY, and POSSIBILITY, consistent
with Holmes’ (1982) scale of certainty of asser-
tions and negations where the writer asserts WITH
CERTAINTY that a proposition is true or not true; or
that the proposition is PROBABLY or POSSIBLY true
or not true. In attitude and affect computational
analysis literature, the context of extracting opin-
ions from news article corpora, Rubin and col-
leagues (2004; 2005) extended Hoye-Holmes
models by adding two extremes on the epistemic
continuum scales: ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY (defined
as a stated unambiguous indisputable conviction or
reassurance) and UNCERTAINTY (defined as hesi-
tancy or stated lack of clarity or knowledge), and
re-defined the middle categories as HIGH CER-
TAINTY (i.e., high probability or firm knowledge),
MODERATE CERTAINTY (i.e., estimation of an aver-
age likelihood or reasonable chances), and LOW
CERTAINTY (i.e., distant possibility, see Fig. 1).

While Rubin’s (2006) model is primarily con-
cerned with identification of certainty levels en-
coded in explicit certainty markers in propositions,
it also takes into account three contextual dimen-
sions relevant to news discourse. Perspective at-
tributes explicit certainty either to the writer or two
types of reported sources – direct participants and
experts in a field. Focus separates certainty in facts
and opinions. Time is an organizing principle of
news production and presentation, and if relevant,
is separated into past, present, or future.

2 Methodology
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999974882352941">
This study uses the above-described conceptual
certainty categorization model to annotate a news
dataset, and produce a typology of syntactic, se-
mantic and lexical classes of certainty markers that
map statements into 5 levels of certainty ranging
from absolutely certain to uncertain.
The dataset consisted of 80 randomly selected
articles (from the AQUAINT Corpus of English
Texts, distributed by The New York Times Ser-
vices in 2000). It constituted a total of 2,243 sen-
tences, with 866 sentences in the editorials and
1377 sentence in the news reports (Rubin, 2006). A
subset of 10 articles (272 sentences, about 12% of
the full dataset) was analyzed by 4 independently
trained annotators (excluding the author). The
agreement results were evaluated in 2 consecutive
intercoder reliability experiments.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.871344">
2.1 Annotation Process
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99995780952381">
The manual annotation scheme was defined in the
codebook instructions that specified the procedures
for determining certainty-qualified statements, the
order of assigning categories, and exemplified each
certainty category (Rubin, 2006). In Experiment 1,
three coders received individual one-hour training
regarding the use of the annotation scheme, and
were instructed to use the original codebook writ-
ten in a general suggestive tone. In Experiment 2,
the fourth annotator went through a more thorough
five-hour training and used a revised, more rigidly-
specified codebook with an alphabetized key-word
index mapped certainty markers into 5 levels.
Each statement in a news article (be it a sentence
or its constituent part such as a clause) was a po-
tential locus of explicit certainty. In both experi-
ments coders were asked to decide if a sentence
had an explicit indication of a certainty level. If so,
they then looked for explicit certainty markers that
contributed to that indication. If a sentence con-
tained a certainty marker, the annotators were in-
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999916">
structed to consider such a sentence certainty-
qualified. The statement was assigned a certainty
level and placed in its pragmatic context (i.e., into
one of the categories) within the perspective, fo-
cus, and time dimensions (see D2 – D4, Fig. 1)
relevant to the news discourse. Each marker was
only assigned one category from each dimension.

2.2 Intercoder Agreement Measures.
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999990133333333">
Each pair of coders were evaluated on whether
they agreed regarding 1) the sentences that contai-
ned explicit certainty markers; 2) the specific cer-
tainty markers within agreed upon certainty-
qualified sentences; and 3) classification of the
agreed upon markers into one of the categories
within each dimension (i.e., level, perspective, fo-
cus and time). The sentence and marker agreement
measures were calculated with percent agreement.
Partial word string matches were considered a
marker match but were weight-adjusted. The
agreed-upon marker category assignments were
assessed in each pair of independent coders with
Cohen’s kappa statistic (Cohen, 1960), averaged,
and compared to the author’s annotation.

3 Results and Discussion

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999878">
3.1 Typology of Certainty Markers
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997614">
The content analysis of the dataset generated a
group of 1,330 explicitly certainty-qualified sen-
tences with 1,727 occurrences of markers. The
markers were grouped into a typology of 43 syn-
tactico-lexical classes; each class is likely to occur
within one of the 5 levels of certainty. The typol-
ogy will become a basis for an automated certainty
identification algorithm. Among the most fre-
quently used certainty markers are central modal
auxiliary verbs (e.g., must, could), gradable adjec-
tives in their superlative degree, and adverbial in-
tensifiers (e.g., much and so), while adjectival
downtoners (e.g., feeble + NP) and adverbial
value disjuncts (e.g., annoyingly, rightly) are
rarely used to express explicit certainty.

3.2 Intercoder Reliability Test Results
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999948759259259">
In Experiment 1, 1) three coders agreed on whether
a sentences was modalized by an explicit certainty
marker or not 71% of the time with 0.33 Cohen’s
kappa, on average. 2) Within agreed-upon cer-
tainly-qualified sentences, three coders agreed on
actual certainty markers 54% of the time, on aver-
age, based on a combined count of the full and
weight-adjusted partial matches. 3) In the categori-
zation task for the agreed-upon markers, the three
coders, on average, were able to reach a slight
agreement in the level and focus dimensions (0.15
and 0.13 kappa statistics, respectively), and a fair
agreement in perspective and time dimensions
(0.44 and 0.41 kappa) according to the Landis and
Koch (1977) agreement interpretation scale.
The subsequent Experiment 2 showed promising
results in agreement on explicit certainty markers
(67%) and overall ability to distinguish certainty-
qualified statements from unmarked statements
(0.51 kappa), and in the relatively intuitive catego-
rization of the perspective dimension (0.65 kappa).
Although stricter instructions may have imposed
a more orderly way of looking at the epistemic
continuum, the 5 level certainty boundaries are still
subject to individual perceptions (0.41 kappa) and
may present difficulties in automation. In spite of
its large inventory of certainty markers, English
may not be precise enough to reliably distinguish
multiple epistemic shades between certainty and
doubt. Alternatively, people might be using same
expressions but underlying categorization systems
for different individuals do not overlap accurately.
Recent pragmatic, discourse, and philosophy of
language studies in mood and modality call for
more comprehensive and truer to natural language
description of epistemic modality in English refer-
ence grammar materials (Hoye, 2005). The latest
modality scholarship will undoubtedly contribute
to natural language applications such as opinion
extraction and sentiment analysis.
Time categorization in the context of certainty
remained a challenge in spite of more vigorous
training in Experiment 2 (0.31 kappa). The inter-
pretation of the reference point of “the present” in
the reported speech and nested events can be am-
biguous in the certainty identification task. Distin-
guishing facts versus opinions in combination with
certainty identification also presented a particularly
puzzling cognitive task (0.16 kappa), possibly due
to necessity to evaluate closely related facets of a
statement: whether the statement is purely factual,
and how sure the author is about the proposition.
The possibility of epistemically modalized facts is
particularly intriguing.

4 Conclusions and Applications
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999987892857143">
This study reported the results of the manual an-
notation of texts in written news discourse, and
identified the most prominent patterns and regu-
larities in explicitly stated markers occurrences in
modalized statements. The linguistic means of ex-
pressing varying levels of certainty are docu-
mented and arranged into the typology of
syntactico-semantic classes. This study implies that
boundaries between shades of certainty in epis-
temically modalized statements (such as probabil-
ity and possibility) are highly subjective and
present difficulties in manual annotation. This con-
clusion may warrant a simplification of the exist-
ing 5 certainty levels to a basic binary distinction
between certainty and doubt. A baseline for future
attempts to improve the calibration of levels and
their boundaries was established. These modest
intercoder reliability results attest to the complex-
ity of the automation of the epistemically modal-
ized statements ranging from certainty to doubt.
In the future studies, I intend to revise the num-
ber of the discrete categories on the epistemic con-
tinuum and further re-define certainty levels
conceptually. I plan to further validate the collec-
tion of agreed-upon certainty markers on a much
larger dataset and by using the typology as input
data to machine learning algorithms for certainty
identification and extraction.

In attitude and affect computational analysis literature, the context of extracting opinions from news article corpora, Rubin and colleagues (2004; 2005) extended Hoye-Holmes models by adding two extremes on the epistemic continuum scales: ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY (defined as a stated unambiguous indis</context>

In spite of its large inventory of certainty markers, English may not be precise enough to reliably distinguish multiple epistemic shades between certainty and doubt. Alternatively, people might be using same expressions but underlying categorization systems for different individuals do not overlap accurately. Recent pragmatic, discourse, and philosophy of language studies in mood and modality call for more comprehensive and truer to natural language description of epistemic modality in English reference grammar materials (Hoye, 2005). The latest modality scholarship will undoubtedly contribute to natural language applications such as opinion extraction and sentiment analysis. Time categorization in the context of certainty remained a challenge in spite of more vigorous training in Experiment 2 (0.31 kappa). The interpretation of the reference point of “the present” in the reported speech and nested events can be ambiguous in the certainty identification task. Distinguishing facts versus opinions in combination with certainty identification also presented a particularly puzzling cognitive task (0.16 kappa), possibly due to</context>

While Rubin’s (2006) model is primarily concerned with identification of certainty levels encoded in explicit certainty markers in propositions, it also takes into account three contextual dimensions relevant to news discourse. Perspective attributes explicit certainty either to the writer or two types of reported sources – direct participants and experts in a field. Focus separates certainty in facts and opinions.

The agreement results were evaluated in 2 consecutive intercoder reliability experiments. 2.1 Annotation Process The manual annotation scheme was defined in the codebook instructions that specified the procedures for determining certainty-qualified statements, the order of assigning categories, and exemplified each certainty category (Rubin, 2006). In Experiment 1, three coders received individual one-hour training regarding the use of the annotation scheme, and were instructed to use the original codebook written in a general suggestive tone. In Experiment 2, the fourth annotator went through a more thorough five-hour training and used a revised, more rigidlyspecified codebook with an alphabetized key-word index mapped certainty markers into 5 levels. Each statement in a news article (be it a sentence or its constituent part such as a clause) was a potential locus of explicit certainty. In both experiments coders were asked to decide </context>
