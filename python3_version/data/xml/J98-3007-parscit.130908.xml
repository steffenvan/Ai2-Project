1. Overview
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998452">
This is a weighty book in more senses than one. At nearly 600 pages (plus an ac-
companying CD-ROM), it has the space to range very widely over the field of speech
synthesis. The chapters comprise a selection of the papers presented at the Second
ESCA / IEEE/ AAAI Workshop on Text-to-Speech Synthesis in 1994 at Mohonk, New
Jersey, U.S.A. (which was organized by the editors of this book). The work represented
covers many laboratories in several countries. This makes for a snapshot of the state
of speech synthesis research across the globe rather than at only one site.
There are eight sections, each preceded by one or two &amp;quot;section introduction&amp;quot; chap-
ters. Including the latter, there are a total of 46 chapters. The eight sections are as
follows:

1. Signal processing and source modelling
2. Linguistic analysis

5. Prosodic analysis of natural speech
6. Synthesis of prosody
7. Evaluation and perception
8. Systems and applications

<bodyText confidence="0.9590033">
The fact that a CD-ROM is included with the book greatly increases the usefulness
of the text, since the speech samples referred to can be played out as one reads. This is
preferable even to making speech files available at a website, since as everyone knows,
download times can be long and servers can be temporarily unavailable.
The standard of editing at times leaves something to be desired. There are various
slips in punctuation and spelling, and also some infelicities of style, due no doubt to
the fact that many papers are written by speakers of a language other than English. In
Computational Linguistics Volume 24, Number 3
such a large volume, a few slips may be expected, but the overall impression is that
not enough attention has been paid to the details of spelling and style.

2. Detailed Comments

The chapters reflect the fact that most research in speech synthesis is based on Ameri-
can English. However, many chapters describe aspects of systems developed for other
languages or varieties, such as German, Japanese, French, Swedish, Italian, Mandarin,
and British English. In addition, there is some discussion of modules or whole systems
for language-independent use, such as the Bell Labs multilingual system architecture
(Sproat and Olive), and data-oriented grapheme-to-phoneme conversion (Daelemans
et al.). The inclusion of a range of languages is to be welcomed, not least because the
use of new languages has the potential to introduce interesting new research problems
to the field.
The growing subfield of prosody and its application to speech synthesis is rightly
given a prominent place, with four section-introduction chapters (for two sections)
and ten contributed chapters. In addition, the chapter entitled &amp;quot;Speech models and
speech synthesis&amp;quot; by Mary Beckman (in the section &amp;quot;Articulatory synthesis and visual
speech&amp;quot;) provides a very lucid and thorough presentation of the symbiotic relation-
ship between basic research in speech science and developments in speech synthesis
research, with particular reference to FO and temporal parameters. Many readers with
a primary interest in prosody for speech synthesis might find this the best chapter to
begin their reading with, presenting as it does the necessary overview within which
individual chapters may be placed.
Concatenative synthesis receives much more attention than formant synthesis,
reflecting the current direction of the field. The section on this theme (&amp;quot;Concatenated
synthesis and automated segmentation&amp;quot;) would provide a graduate student with an
excellent insight into current research problems that are still far from solved. As the
section introduction by Joseph Olive notes about the concatenative method: &amp;quot;So far,
this has not produced a consensus, but rather a diversity of approaches.&amp;quot; This comment
could well apply to the book as a whole, which succeeds admirably in displaying the
range of approaches on offer.
Occasional chapters are a little too skimpy and leave the reader unsatisfied. This is
probably unavoidable in a book that seeks to cover the entire range of speech synthesis
research in one volume. For example, the chapter &amp;quot;A structured way of looking at the
performance of text-to-speech systems&amp;quot; (Pols and Jekosch) presents the method in
brief outline, and might have benefited from more detail and from a description of
an implementation of the method. Likewise, the chapter &amp;quot;A modular architecture for
multilingual text-to-speech&amp;quot; (Sproat and Olive) provides little more than a quick tour
through the structure of a working multilingual synthesis system. In the case of the
latter, much fuller details are available elsewhere (in Sproat 1998) and its relatively
parsimonious appearance here reflects the fact that the present volume aims to cover
a wide spread of systems rather than concentrating on one alone.

The work reported covers many different laboratories, countries, and theoretical in-
terests. For this reason, it is useful as a general introduction to the major research
issues for a reader who has a little background in linguistics, computing, or signal
processing. It therefore has a different readership from the more recent comparable
book Multilingual Text-to-Speech Synthesis: The Bell Labs Approach (Sproat 1998). The lat-

ter centres on research at one laboratory in some detail, and focuses in particular on
the Bell Labs multilingual speech synthesizer (where common algorithms are used
for multiple languages). The material in the present book (which derives from a 1994
workshop) is of less-recent origin than that of Sproat. However, this is not necessarily
a disadvantage for the reader whose aim is to learn about the background to current
research issues and the various kinds of method used to address them.
In short, this book would be a valuable addition to the library of any researcher in
speech synthesis. It would also be of use to a theoretical linguist seeking to learn how
phonological theories have been implemented in working systems, and the nature of
the problems involved. The inclusion of a CD-ROM with speech examples is a great
asset in a field where output speech quality is the measure of success. The section
introductions alone would form a useful quick tutorial for those needing only a taste
of the field. But the individual chapters offer an astonishingly wide range of subjects,
presented by active researchers, and will repay close study.
