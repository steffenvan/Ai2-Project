This volume contains the papers accepted for presentation at the Workshop on Natural Language
Processing in the Biomedical Domain, held at the University of Pennsylvania on July 11, 2002, just
following the 40th Meeting of the ACL.
Biomedicine is a large domain, comprising biological sciences, clinical medicine, and public
health. While this subject area is vast, spanning from the molecular level to whole populations, there
is a unifying focus on health and disease. These characteristics imbue biomedical language with
unique properties: an enormous number of lexical items but relatively small number of semantic
patterns.
Biomedicine presents many opportunities for application of NLP technologies such as
information extraction from biomedical texts, document and answer retrieval from large,
unstructured text collections (such as the biomedical literature and the World Wide Web), and
interaction with users through natural language.
The principal purpose of the workshop was to explore challenges in processing biomedical
language and to present results in developing techniques for this domain. Another important
motivation was to bring researchers together from computational linguistics, bioinformatics and
medical informatics. Until recently, the level of collaboration among these disciplines has been
limited. Indeed, this was the first workshop under the auspices of the ACL entirely devoted to
biomedical language processing.
We received a total of 26 submissions, from which 12 were selected for presentation, using a
double-blind refereeing process. The papers in this volume represent work from 5 countries in Asia,
Europe, and North America, which provides some evidence of the growing interest in this domain.
The submissions also demonstrate the considerable breadth of research in this area.
The papers are grouped into four themes. These illustrate some of the key issues currently being
explored in biomedical language research. The first group, “Biomedical Name Recognition” deals
with the challenge that biomedical names (eg genes and proteins) are not only myriad, but also
constantly growing. The second group “Machine Learning of Biomedical Language” investigates
the use of machine learning techniques by exploiting various aspects of the restricted nature
of biomedical language. “Biomedical Indexing” returns to the large vocabulary problem in the
context of information retrieval, a vital application in medicine and biology. Finally, “Biomedical
Information Resources” explores various ways in which NLP can help biomedical researchers and
clinicians access the knowledge emerging in the scientific literature.
The idea for this workshop originated at the annual meeting of the American Medical
Informatics Association in November, 2001. I am indebted to my co-chair Judith Klavans for
the suggestion, and also for her encouragement and advice. I would also like to thank the program
committee for their assistance in refereeing the papers, and also for many helpful suggestions.
