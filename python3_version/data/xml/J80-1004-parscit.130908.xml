The convening of an international conference on
Computational Linguistics in Medicine and the sub-
stantive results reported in many of the papers in
this volume of Conference Proceedings testify to the
special relevance of research in computational lin-
guistics to the problem of processing medical infor-
mation. While no discipline, even the most mathe-
matically oriented, escapes a dependence on lan-
guage to record and transmit its findings, medicine
relies for its daily operations on the ability of its
practitioners to draw upon information in natural
language form, both patient data and the medical
knowledge relevant to treatment. Given the diversi-
ty and complexity of the problems that are handled,
and the vast store of medical knowledge that must
be remembered or consulted as part of the treatment
process, it is no wonder that medicine is one of the
first fields to seek computer aids for accessing and
processing natural language information. The pur-
pose of this conference was to explore whether de-
velopments in computational linguistics and artificial
intelligence have something to contribute to this
problem.
Two major directions of research are seen in the
papers at this conference and in the field it repre-
sents. Broadly speaking, one stream of research
draws upon the methods of artificial intelligence and
is concerned with general mechanisms of knowledge
representation and reasoning, in this case as they
apply mainly to clinical decision making. Language
processing as such is not much in evidence in these
papers, but the need to draw upon knowledge in
language form is the background and assumption of
much of the work. On the other hand, there is a
growing body of research devoted to developing
techniques for analyzing and processing the natural
language form of medical information. In this work,
there is a trend toward representing the data in
structures that take account of the semantic rela-
tions among terms in medical statements. Though at
this time the two areas of research are still quite
distinct, a common ground may develop in the fu-
ture when the Al projects look deeper into their
data sources, and the data processors seek more
powerful systems for representing information.
The 18 papers in the volume are organized into
three sections: Methodological Background (7 pa-
pers), Medical Projects and Applications (7 papers),
and Aspects of Hardware and Software (4 papers).
Cross-cutting these major divisions, the papers can
be grouped by topic to indicate the range of present
work in this area as represented by the Conference.

Space permits a more detailed treatment of only
the main groups of papers. In the general methods
set, Werner Schneider in the opening paper traces
the background to the Conference in the work of a
study group of the International Hospital Federation
on the application of computer techniques in health
care. The 1975 report of the study group, which is
summarized in the paper, led to the organization of
this Conference in recognition of the importance of
research directed toward the development of techni-
ques for the formalization of medical knowledge.
Schneider describes and criticizes the early, and still
dominant, attitude toward the use of computers in
medicine: &amp;quot;The basic idea was that more data --
especially so-called &apos;hard&apos;-data, i.e. measured by
natural science methodology -- would produce more
and better information and that more information
would lead to better decisions. As a consequence a
large number of sometimes huge databanks have
been established, mostly based on a rather random
choice of which data should be collected and treated
by more or less advanced statistical procedures.&amp;quot; In
contrast, Schneider stresses the importance of devel-
oping models and formalizing techniques for the
representation of medical knowledge.
In Erik Sandewall&apos;s characterization of Artificial
Intelligence the dominant methodology of Al is &amp;quot;to
implement limited-purpose systems in order to de-
velop general methods and principles, and also in
order to develop software tools.&amp;quot; Sandewall lists a
number of general methods that he sees emerging in
Al research (practical, low-key parsing of natural
language; assimilation of natural language into a
data base; representation of natural-language-based
knowledge in a data base; deductive search; search
in a problem space; scene analysis) and charts the
major applicational areas in terms of their use of
these methods. Carl Welin&apos;s paper in this group is a
straightforward summary of the major constructs of
semantic networks. Uwe Hein&apos;s paper proposes
criteria for the design of a medium for the repre-
sentation of knowledge and presents a 3-level sys-
tem for this purpose, implemented in LISP. The
PSYPAC system (Pfeifer et al.) is intended as an
instrument for building models of cognitive process-
es in human behavior. What is proposed is a very
general formalism for such descriptions.
To analyze the clinical decision process procedur-
ally, to determine which parts of the process can
(and perhaps can best) be performed by computer,
to design such a system and engineer it for fail-safe
operation and for physician acceptance, these are
some of the questions faced in computational re-
search on clinical decision making. Epstein and
Kaplan provide a modular model of the clinical deci-
sion process in which the major modules are Input,
Question-Answering, Data Base, and Clinical Deci-
sion Making. The latter module, which is based on
papers in the medical literature, consists of succes-
sive iterations through the functional blocks of data
acquisition, data analysis and plan formation with
associated feedback between functional blocks. A
set of questions that have to be answered for each
patient problem is stated, and technical issues, such
as the need to limit the search space, are also raised.
In addition to the process model, a generalized
knowledge representation model (based on prior
work of Kulikowski and Weiss) is sketched. The
last half of the paper is devoted to the formulation
and discussion of criteria for the process and
knowledge-representation models, and the issues
both medical and technical associated with each
criterion. Some of the authors&apos; criteria include med-
ical factors not commonly considered in Al models,
e.g., utility-driven search strategy and modification
of diagnosis therapy or therapy based on outcome
information. There is a brief informative discussion
of statistical approaches, production rules, and net-
work representation methods as they apply to the
clinical decision problem. The paper is a model of
clear exposition and provides a comprehensive
framework for thinking about the clinical decision
process in precise procedural terms.
E.H. Shortliffe&apos;s MYCIN system for computer-
based medical consultation is well know in the Al
field and beyond. The paper in this volume can
serve as a brief introduction to the design criteria of
MYCIN and also the design itself for those who
have not read other papers or the book on the sys-
tem. The knowledge base in MYCIN is provided by
physician-experts and is represented as production
rules. A major design criterion was to provide the
system with the ability to explain decisions to the
physician user.

The approach to the clinical decision making
problem taken by Pauker and Szolovits begins with
an analysis of clinical hypothesis formation as it
appears in the actual behavior of expert clinicians,
with particular emphasis on the formation of the
initial hypothesis in response to the history of the
present illness. &amp;quot;Before making any decisions about
diagnostic tests or treatments, or indeed before ask-
ing more than the most cursory, automatic, descrip-
tive questions, the physician must limit his domain
of consideration to an appropriately narrow con-
text.&amp;quot; The paper analyzes this process of context
formation and describes a program, the Present Ill-
ness Program, written in CONNIVER and MA-
CLISP, which simulates this process. The domain of
the program is a patient who presents with the chief
complaint of edema. A supervisory component ac-
quires patient-specific data from the physician,
checks it and stores it in a short term memory. The
short-term memory also contains &amp;quot;demon&amp;quot; pro-
grams, compiled from a knowledge base in long-term
memory, whose task is to match stored patterns
against the patient-specific findings. The paper de-
scribes and evaluates the operation of the program.
In addition, the authors offer some general remarks
of interest on computational linguistics in medicine.
At some point (and usually at many points) in
the health care process and in clinical research, pa-
tient data must be consulted. Where large numbers
of patients are involved, the problems of organizing,
coding and retrieving the data are crucial. Since
much of the data is initially in natural language
form, the approaches and systems which have
evolved for actual use are extremely interesting from
a computational linguistics point of view. These
systems were not developed by computational lin-
guistics, but in a number of respects they represent
the most advanced applicational research in CL be-
cause of their commitment to provide large scale,
real world natural language data processing. One of
the earliest systems to adopt a natural language ap-
proach to report-storage and retrieval (though it
does not perform linguistic analysis of the input
string) is the Natural Language Retrieval System of
UCLA Hospital , which has been in operation since
the mid 1960&apos;s (Okubo and Lamson). Four data
bases of impressive size are maintained (Surgical
Pathology, Autopsy, Nuclear Medicine, Neuroradiol-
ogy), a total in 1977 of 234,794 documents contain-
ing 4,252,385 words. Retrieval requests are formu-
lated in conventional Boolean query logic by a
search specialist employing a large thesaurus. The
paper discusses factors which would influence the
design of an interactive interface to replace the
present human interaction of requester and search
specialist in formulating the data base query. Sug-
gestions based on extensive experience with the
system include providing the user the ability to
browse through selected parts of the thesaurus with
updated frequency counts for terms and an easy way
of referencing synonymous multiple word descriptors
and cross-linkages that combine two or more syno-
nym classes to represent another search entity.
Several papers in this group describe patient-data
systems that provide a structuring of the natural
language input strings in order to facilitate and
sharpen retrieval. These systems are particularly
interesting for CL because they employ (or imply) a
syntactic/semantic model of the input information.
Again, because of space limitations, only some of
the systems can be discussed here, although all the
papers in this group were substantive and worth-
while.
The system for automatic encoding of natural
language pathology reports, developed at NIH from
the mid 1960&apos;s and onward (Pratt), is based on
look-up in a semantically structured phrase diction-
ary, the Systematized Nomenclature of Pathology
(SNOP). SNOP terms are divided into four highly
structured lists: Topography (names of body sites --
T-terms), Morphology (names of structural changes
that occur in tissues as a result of disease -- M-
terms), Etiology (causative agents of disease -- E-
terms), Function (names of the physiological mani-
festations associated with disease -- F-terms). The
automatic encoder identifies syntactic units, trans-
forms certain morphologically related forms into the
word form used in the SNOP vocabulary, looks up
the units in the encoding dictionary (SNOP), and
combines the resulting codes for the T, M, E, F
terms into &amp;quot;TMEF statements&amp;quot; which compose the
document surrogate. Translated back into English
the complete TMEF statement might be read as a
prototype pathology report sentence: This body site
T has undergone morphological change M due to the
causative agent E resulting in physiological manifes-
tations F. The TMEF statement thus constitutes a
fixed formatted record which is efficient for high
precision retrieval and at the same time constitutes a
syntactic-semantic model of the pathology data in
the original natural language pathology report.
It is interesting to compare the TMEF (SNOP)
formalization of pathology diagnostic statements
with the artificial language REMEDE (de Heaulme
and Mery), which is in use for the (manual) encod-
ing of clinical reports in Rheumatology, Endocrinol-
ogy, Urology, and Vascular Surgery in Hopital Co-
chin, Paris. As in SNOP, the point of view in RE-
MEDE is that the nomenclature should reflect the
semantic structure. The systematized nomenclature
can be employed in a formally defined syntax; RE-
MEDE has, for example, such symbols as &lt; (&amp;quot;of&amp;quot;),
&gt; (&amp;quot;due to&amp;quot;), * (&amp;quot;treated by&amp;quot;) and = (&amp;quot;equal&amp;quot; --

Logical operators can be used, and further operators
(e.g., for &amp;quot;between&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;qualified by&amp;quot;) have been
defined, so that relatively complex clinical state-
ments can be expressed. Also a means for including
time data is included. This artificial language is
sufficiently close to the syntactic form of simple,
straightforward natural language sentences express-
ing the same information that it would seem feasible
to automate the coding process directly from natural
language input, although this possibility is not dis-
cussed in the paper.
Taken as a whole, this volume shows the exist-
ence of an area of interest between the processing
of medical information and the analysis and process-
ing of language.

This book is a collection of good articles. It is
not, however, a good collection of articles. The
only connection between them is that their authors
all lectured at the International Summer School on
Computational and Mathematical Linguistics at Pisa
in 1974. Each lecturer was asked to contribute a
chapter to the book; some of the contributions were
specifically written for it, while others are papers
that the authors had published elsewhere. Although
each article is good by itself, the book as a whole
lacks a common theme, a logical progression from
one article to another, and a common level of back-
ground knowledge expected of the reader.
Three of the articles taken together make a good
survey of computational linguistics: On natural lan-
guage based computer systems by Stanley Petrick,
Natural language understanding systems within the AI
paradigm by Yorick Wilks, and Five lectures on arti-
ficial intelligence by Terry Winograd. Although the
articles are three to five years old, the issues they
discuss are still among the most active research top-
ics today. One strength is the variety of viewpoints
on many of the same systems and issues. One
weakness is the skimpy treatment of semantic net-
works and related graphs: Winograd, for example,
devotes two pages to them out of 123, while using
eleven pages to reproduce the same SHRDLU dialog
that he has been quoting for the past eight years.
One absurdity is the placement of these introductory
articles near the end of the book because the chap-
ters are listed alphabetically by their authors&apos; last
names.
Three tutorials on techniques are Synthesis of
speech from unrestricted text by Jonathan Allen,
Morphological and syntactic analysis by Martin Kay,
and Lunar rocks in natural English by William
Woods. Allen&apos;s article is a short survey of the state
of the art and current issues in speech synthesis.
Woods describes the various phases of the LUNAR
system; he doesn&apos;t give enough detail to enable a
beginner to build his own system, but he gives
enough motivation and references to show someone
where to go for further information. Kay, however,
buries the reader in detail, including 21 pages of
traces from his parser. Such detail is acceptable in a
technical report, but an article of this sort should
put more emphasis on the reasons for these techni-
ques. Some comparisons with the parsing methods
of Petrick, Wilks, Winograd, and Woods would be
especially useful since they are discussed elsewhere
in the same book.
Two articles that relate computational questions
to more general issues in linguistics and psychology
are Scenes-and-frames semantics by Charles Fillmore
and Cognition: The linguistic approach by David
Hays. Fillmore&apos;s article meanders for seventeen
untitled sections: he presents a wealth of observa-
tions that a semantic theory must account for, but
he never attempts to systematize his observations or
present a tentative theory of his own. Hays, on the
other hand, has a short, tightly organized discussion
of the psychological implications of cognitive net-
works. But his article is so vague and devoid of
examples that it is hardly more than an extended
abstract.
Four other papers, &apos;The position of embedding
transformations in a grammar&apos; revisited by Emmon
Bach, Focus and negation by Eva Hajieova, Some
observations concerning the differences between sen-
tence and text by Ferenc Kiefer, and John is easy to
please by Barbara Partee, treat theoretical points in
linguistics that are also important computationally.
Yet none of the authors cite any computational or
Al work in their bibliographies or make any attempt
to relate their issues to computational methods.
These four articles illustrate a frequent failing of
interdisciplinary conferences: the speakers talk past
one another without ever reconciling their vocabu-
laries or coming to grips with common issues. (In
their more recent work, Bach and Partee and their
graduate students have been combining Montague
