<bodyText confidence="0.987050266666667">
In the knowledge society, researchers on lexicography
recognize the need to advance in the structure of dictionary
information so that it can be understood by people and
computers. In relation with dictionary definitions, the
adoption of models or templates would be advantageous for
the generation of complete definitions and also for the
extraction of semantic information from them.
In this study, we manually analyzed specialized
dictionary definitions of the ceramic field belonging to the
conceptual groups of ceramic processes and ceramic defects
in order to identify the relevant conceptual features, such as
physical aspect or function, and the linguistic realization of
these features in the definitions.
Results can help to extract information from definitions
and to also generate formalized dictionary definitions.

<bodyText confidence="0.981177685185185">
Definitions are a very valuable source of semantic
information for different tasks such as the creation of
ontologies, lexicography, terminology and natural
language processing. Applied research into computational
lexicography and terminology is being carried out to
recognize definitions in specialized texts and to analyze
the semantic relationships that occur in these definitions
[19, 20, 14, 17]. Dictionary definitions are other means of
obtaining semantic data and of discovering relationships
between the concepts of a domain. We can find numerous
studies intended to extract information from the definitions
in existing dictionaries. Most of them aim to extract
taxonomic relationships [5, 11]. However, more effort is
needed to exploit the rest of the information present in the
definitions, such as specific features and non- hierarchical
conceptual relationships [4, 6, 7, 10]. When attempting to
extract this information, the biggest problem that
automatic systems face is the lack of homogeneity and
systematicity in definitions. Most dictionary definitions
present inconsistent and incomplete information as well as
terms which should be equally treated and which are
defined in a very different way [9]. Many authors highlight
the need to create more standardized, precise definitions in
a format that is understandable for computers and humans
alike so that extraction and reusability are easier.

One of the objectives of the ONTODIC1 project is to
develop a system to assist the terminographer in the
elaboration of definitions. This system will semi-
automatically generate definitions based on a definitional
template and a domain ontology. The definitional template
will contain the necessary linguistic markers to introduce
each feature into the definition. An example of this
definitional template for the conceptual group ceramic
tiles is proposed by Alcina [1]:
“A ceramic tile whose shape is X and size is Y, and is
decorated with Z to serve as Q”
Variables x, y, z and q will be replaced by the values
that each feature in the concept description acquires.
In this study, our objective is to observe the type of
features which are relevant for the description of two
conceptual groups (ceramic processes and ceramic
defects) in this domain and to analyze how they are
expressed linguistically in the 222 definitions taken from
three specialized dictionaries of the ceramic field. We
studied the linguistic patterns used in the definitions to
introduce features. This set of features and their linguistic
realization can, on the one hand, be useful to extract
information from dictionaries and, on the other, to generate
definitions.

texts and dictionary definitions

<bodyText confidence="0.9991214">
Several studies have been conducted to automatically
identify the related concepts in a corpus. However, most of
them focus on the English and French languages with few
centering on Spanish [23, 19]. The authors agree that a
good way to extract information from texts is by searching
for recurrent patterns.
According to [15], knowledge patterns are “words,
word combinations or paralinguistic features which
frequently indicate conceptual relations”. The authors
distinguish three types of patterns:

Lexical patterns which are words that indicate a
relation. For example, is a can indicate hypernymy.
Grammatical patterns which are combinations of part-
of-speech. The NOUN+VERB pattern can indicate the
function relation as in the sentence: L’unité centrale
effectue le traitement.
Paralinguistic patterns which include punctuation,
parenthesis, text structure, etc. The authors provide the
following example where the questions introduce the
hypernymic relation. Qu’est-ce qu’un réseau ? Un réseau

According to [11], “definitions use a sublanguage of
natural language”. Dictionary definitions have a more
explicit semantic language structure which is accessible
for analysis [24].
Conceptually, analytical definitions have two main
components: genus which reflects the hierarchical
conceptual organization in the specialized domain in the
definitions and differentiae or specific features which
distinguish the defined concept from their co-hyponyms
and reflect all kinds of relations in a domain.
In [24] it is acknowledged that it is less difficult to
extract generic terms from definitions for computational
semantics than to extract specific features. It is not
possible to find a complete list of the semantic information
that can be extracted from definitions in the literature.
Sager and L’Homme [18] considered that this part of the
definitions is not susceptible to codification following a
restricted set of features and that this would be an
important step for the systematization of terminographic
definitions.

3. Methodology
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99992775">
In this study, we use dictionary definitions to extract the
features and relations of concepts. The aim of this study is
to discover linguistic patterns that are used in the
definitions to denote the specific features of concepts. In
order to find regularities among the definitions, we
restricted the analysis to the conceptual groups of ceramic
processes and ceramic defects which are described by a
limited set of features.

3.1 Definition selection
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994043615384615">
We analyzed 222 definitions from three dictionaries of the
ceramics domain: Diccionario científico-práctico de la
cerámica, Diccionario de cerámica y Terminología de los
defectos cerámicos [12, 13, 21]. These dictionaries are
published on paper and have been digitalized [3].
From these dictionaries, we extracted the definitions of
the concepts included in the categories of ceramic
production processes and defects in the ceramic product. It
is important for our study that the conceptual groups to be
homogeneous enough to be able to identify a relevant set
of features for all of them. In total, we analyzed 135
definitions of the conceptual group ceramic processes and
87 ceramic defects.

3.2 Identification of conceptual features in
the definitions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.989237692307692">
The definitions in these dictionaries vary considerably as
regards to the use of words and their formal structure [2].
Many of them follow the analytical model with the
formula Definiendum = genus + differentia, although we
can also find descriptions by means of synonyms,
paraphrases, etc. In this analysis, we did not focus on the
formal aspects of the definitions, but on the conceptual
features that they provide. We analyzed the definitions in
order to obtain a set of features which are commonly used
in the descriptions of the concepts of each conceptual
group. We followed the proposal of [16] which
distinguishes between the name of the feature and its
value. The name of the feature acts as a label that indicates
the content of the feature, while the value offers specific
information about a concept. For example, cause is the
name and friction the value of a feature for the concept
abrasion.
This conceptual analysis was carried out by
segmenting the information obtained from the definition
and by assigning a label or code which describes the type
of information that each fragment represents, as seen in
Figure 1. In order to carry out this analysis, we used the
program for the qualitative analysis named Atlas.ti. This
program allows us to: segment the information, assign a
descriptive code, create relations between them, obtain
graphic representations of the conceptual structure of data
and query as in a database.
The result is a list of essential features to describe each
category and a set of values for each of these features. The
features detected for these categories are as follows
(frequency of appearance in the corpus is indicated in the
parenthesis):
Production process features are PROCEDURE (69),
OBJECTIVE (103), PATIENT (56), MATERIAL STATE (15),
INSTRUMENTS (22), PREVIOUS STAGE (6) and NEXT STAGE
(8).
Ceramic defect features are PHYSICAL ASPECT (54),
ZONE (16), CAUSE (44), PHASE (15), METHOD (5) and
PRODUCT (25).

We marked the linguistic expression that precedes each
feature. In some cases it is possible to identify a linguistic
marker that introduces a particular feature. As Figure 2
illustrates, the feature OBJECTIVE of a process is introduced
into the first definition by the linguistic pattern “que sirve
para” (in English “which serves to”) and in the second, by
the marker “con el fin de” (“for the purpose of”).

The results obtained in this analysis consist in a set of
linguistic markers and recurrent syntactic structures
denoting different types of features in the definitions.
Linguistic markers introduce the feature; one example
would be en forma de (Eng. as -like) to describe the
physical aspect of a defect. Recurrent syntactic patterns are
syntactic constructions that mark a particular meaning; for
example, the use of gerund constructions to express the
mode of carrying out a process.

5. Discussion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99993125">
We analyzed 222 terminographic definitions belonging to
the conceptual groups: ceramic defects and ceramic
processes. In these definitions, we detected 13 types of
conceptual features: OBJECTIVE, PROCEDURE, PATIENT,
INSTRUMENTS, PREVIOUS PHASE, NEXT PHASE, MATERIAL
STATE, PHYSICAL ASPECT, ZONE, CAUSE, PHASE, METHOD
and PRODUCT. We identified some patterns which have
been used to introduce the features into the definitions.
The results of this analysis show problems relating to the
variety of the feature expression in the definitions, absence
of a common genus in the definitions of the same group
and other problems which previous studies identified [15,
8], such as the polysemy of patterns, morphological
variants and the non-contiguity of the elements of the
pattern. We now go on to explain these problems in the
following sections.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.977012">
• Diversity in the linguistic expression of the
features in the definitions
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999972814814815">
The heterogeneity of these definitions affects both the
conceptual and linguistic levels. At the conceptual level,
we can see that two ceramic defects are not defined when
the same features in the definitions are used. For example,
in the definition of the defect dunting, the features
PHYSICAL ASPECT, CAUSE and STAGE are described.
However in the definition of the defect conicity, only the
feature PHYSICAL ASPECT is used to describe this concept.
At the linguistic level, we can find a wide range of
linguistic markers and structures to express the same kind
of feature. For example, the feature PROCEDURE is
expressed in 10 definitions of ceramic processes by means
of a gerund clause. However, in 23 cases, this feature is a
sentence which does not show any common pattern. The
only regularity found in these cases is the semantic
proximity of the verbs used to describe this feature which
are mainly verbs of action (to immerse, to submerge, to
project, to pulverize, to attract, etc.), as seen in the
following examples: 1. este se sumerge en la barbotina y
se escurre; 2. el esmalte se proyecta sobre la pieza
cerámica; 3. el producto bizcochado se sumerge en una
suspensión de los ingredientes del esmalte en agua; 4. las
partículas que han de ser pulverizadas se les da una carga
electrostática opuesta a la de la pieza a esmaltar; esta
atrae a las partículas hacia la pieza. Semantic annotation
would be necessary to automatically extract this feature
from the definitions.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.921195">
• Absence of a genus in the definitions
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.995420105263158">
The formal structure of the analyzed definitions does not
always respect the established model of genus and
differentia. Many definitions do not include the genus or
hypernym of the conceptual group. The first position is
filled with a specific feature which cannot be preceded by
a linguistic marker.
For example, around 70% of the definitions of
ceramic defects do not have the genus defect or
imperfection, but include the feature PHYSICAL ASPECT in
the first position which is expressed by means of a noun
phrase without a linguistic marker, as shown in the
following definitions:
rebaba. Delgada cresta (Eng. ‘thin crest’) [PHYSICAL
ASPECT] en la superficie o en el borde de un objeto,
formada generalmente por la penetración de vidrio
entre las partes del molde.
desventado. Grieta (Eng. ‘crack’) [PHYSICAL ASPECT]
en la pieza cocida por enfriamiento demásiado
rápido.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.979383">
• Polysemy of linguistic markers
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.973356368421053">
In certain cases, a linguistic marker introduces a different
type of feature into the definitions. For example, the
structure por + noun phrase is used to express the feature
CAUSE, as in por enfriamiento demasiado (Eng., ‘due to
fast cooling’), but the PROCEDURE is also used, as in por
inmersión de la pieza (Eng., ‘by immersing the tile’). The
same happens with the linguistic marker consistente en
(Eng. ‘consisting in’) which precedes the feature PHYSICAL
ASPECT of a defect (consistente en una textura punteada
(Eng. ‘consisting in a dotted texture’)), as well as the
OBJECTIVE of a process (consistente en recubrir el acero o
hierro con cinc (Eng. ‘consisting in covering the steel or
iron with zinc’)).
• Morphosyntactic variety of linguistic markers
Many patterns do not show a unique form in the
definitions because they can be expressed in any of their
morphological variants. This is especially common in the
verbal patterns as they appear to be conjugated in different
forms, as the example shows.

<listItem confidence="0.851455">
• Non contiguity of the elements of the marker
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998444">
We have also found some cases in which the marker is
interrupted by another element. For example, the marker
formad* por appears in the text with an adverb between
the verb and the preposition (formada generalmente por la
penetración del vidrio... (Eng., ‘formed generally by the
penetration of the glass’))
Results show that the definitions of these dictionaries
lack uniformity and that some of the patterns identified in
the expression of the features offer some problems that
complicate the automatic extraction of information.

6. Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9996979">
In this paper we describe the linguistic expression of the
different features (such as PHYSICAL ASPECT or CAUSE,
included in the definitions of ceramic dictionaries. The aim
of the study was to obtain a set of linguistic markers or
syntactic patterns for these features. Results reveal a huge
heterogeneity in the linguistic realization of the conceptual
features in the definitions and the patterns identified show
problems such as polysemy and morphological variety.
The ONTODIC project aims to design a tool for
computer-assisted terminography which will help the
terminographer to create definitions of specialized
concepts. These definitions will be based on a template
which will guarantee consistency and explicitness. One of
the template elements is a restricted set of linguistic
markers which will introduce each type of feature into the
definitions. This analysis has helped us to observe the
naturally occurring markers in the definitions. In future
works, we will select one or more linguistic pattern(s) for
the expression of each feature in the differentia in our tool
for computer-assisted terminography.

<abstract confidence="0.9994666875">In the knowledge society, researchers on lexicography recognize the need to advance in the structure of dictionary information so that it can be understood by people and computers. In relation with dictionary definitions, the adoption of models or templates would be advantageous for the generation of complete definitions and also for the extraction of semantic information from them. In this study, we manually analyzed specialized dictionary definitions of the ceramic field belonging to the groups of processes defects in order to identify the relevant conceptual features, such as physical aspect or function, and the linguistic realization of these features in the definitions. Results can help to extract information from definitions and to also generate formalized dictionary definitions.</abstract>

Amparo Alcina TecnoLeTTra Team Universitat Jaume I Castellón, Spain alcina@trad.uji.es One of the objectives of the ONTODIC1 project is to develop a system to assist the terminographer in the elaboration of definitions. This system will semiautomatically generate definitions based on a definitional template and a domain ontology. The definitional template will contain the necessary linguistic markers to introduce each feature into the definition. An example of this definitional template for the conceptual group ceramic tiles is proposed by Alcina [1]: “A ceramic tile whose shape is X and size is Y, and is decorated with Z to serve as Q” Variables x, y, z and q will be replaced by the values that each feature in the concept description acquires. In this study, our objective is to observe the type of features which are relevant for the description of two conceptual groups (ceramic processes and ceramic defects) in this domain and to analyze how they are expressed linguistically in the 222 definitions taken from three specialized dictionaries of the ceramic field.

In these definitions, we detected 13 types of conceptual features: OBJECTIVE, PROCEDURE, PATIENT, INSTRUMENTS, PREVIOUS PHASE, NEXT PHASE, MATERIAL STATE, PHYSICAL ASPECT, ZONE, CAUSE, PHASE, METHOD and PRODUCT. We identified some patterns which have been used to introduce the features into the definitions. The results of this analysis show problems relating to the variety of the feature expression in the definitions, absence of a common genus in the definitions of the same group and other problems which previous studies identified [15, 8], such as the polysemy of patterns, morphological variants and the non-contiguity of the elements of the pattern. We now go on to explain these problems in the following sections. • Diversity in the linguistic expression of the features in the definitions The heterogeneity of these definitions affects both the conceptual and linguistic levels. At the conceptual level, we can see that two ceramic defects are not defined when the same features in the definitions are used.

However, most of them focus on the English and French languages with few centering on Spanish [23, 19]. The authors agree that a good way to extract information from texts is by searching for recurrent patterns. According to [15], knowledge patterns are “words, word combinations or paralinguistic features which frequently indicate conceptual relations”. The authors distinguish three types of patterns: 1 ONTODIC: Methodology and Technology for the creation of onomasiologic dictionaries based on ontologies.

In these definitions, we detected 13 types of conceptual features: OBJECTIVE, PROCEDURE, PATIENT, INSTRUMENTS, PREVIOUS PHASE, NEXT PHASE, MATERIAL STATE, PHYSICAL ASPECT, ZONE, CAUSE, PHASE, METHOD and PRODUCT. We identified some patterns which have been used to introduce the features into the definitions. The results of this analysis show problems relating to the variety of the feature expression in the definitions, absence of a common genus in the definitions of the same group and other problems which previous studies identified [15, 8], such as the polysemy of patterns, morphological variants and the non-contiguity of the elements of the pattern. We now go on to explain these problems in the following sections. • Diversity in the linguistic expression of the features in the definitions The heterogeneity of these definitions affects both the conceptual and linguistic levels. At the conceptual level, we can see that two ceramic defects are not defined when the same features in the definitions are used. For example, in the definition of the defect dunting, the features PHYSICAL ASPECT, CAUSE and STAGE are described. However in</context>

Many of them follow the analytical model with the formula Definiendum = genus + differentia, although we can also find descriptions by means of synonyms, paraphrases, etc. In this analysis, we did not focus on the formal aspects of the definitions, but on the conceptual features that they provide. We analyzed the definitions in order to obtain a set of features which are commonly used in the descriptions of the concepts of each conceptual group. We followed the proposal of [16] which distinguishes between the name of the feature and its value. The name of the feature acts as a label that indicates the content of the feature, while the value offers specific information about a concept. For example, cause is the name and friction the value of a feature for the concept abrasion. This conceptual analysis was carried out by segmenting the information obtained from the definition and by assigning a label or code which describes the type of information that each fragment represents, as seen in Figure 1.

In [24] it is acknowledged that it is less difficult to extract generic terms from definitions for computational semantics than to extract specific features. It is not possible to find a complete list of the semantic information that can be extracted from definitions in the literature. Sager and L’Homme [18] considered that this part of the definitions is not susceptible to codification following a restricted set of features and that this would be an important step for the systematization of terminographic definitions. 3. Methodology In this study, we use dictionary definitions to extract the features and relations of concepts. The aim of this study is to discover linguistic patterns that are used in the definitions to denote the specific features of concepts.

The aim of this study is to discover linguistic patterns that are used in the definitions to denote the specific features of concepts. In order to find regularities among the definitions, we restricted the analysis to the conceptual groups of ceramic processes and ceramic defects which are described by a limited set of features. 3.1 Definition selection We analyzed 222 definitions from three dictionaries of the ceramics domain: Diccionario científico-práctico de la cerámica, Diccionario de cerámica y Terminología de los defectos cerámicos [12, 13, 21]. These dictionaries are published on paper and have been digitalized [3]. From these dictionaries, we extracted the definitions of the concepts included in the categories of ceramic production processes and defects in the ceramic product. It is important for our study that the conceptual groups to be homogeneous enough to be able to identify a relevant set of features for all of them. In total, we analyzed 135 definitions of the conceptual group ceramic processes and 87 ceramic defects. 3.2 Identification of conceptual features in the definitions The definitions in these dictionaries vary con</context>
