Clifford establishes with his semantics of temporal reference a major connection be-
tween two areas of computational semantics, namely the semantics of databases and
the semantics of natural language. He argues that a semantic representation of time is
essential in making database queries more natural and efficient. Chapter 2 presents es-
sentially a variant of Gallin&apos;s (1975) TY2: an intensional logic, IL„ which is Montague&apos;s
formal language of PTQ enriched with constants and variables for temporal indices
and interpreted with respect to simple reference points consisting only of times—that
is, dropping possible worlds and all modality. There are two important differences
between IL, and Montague&apos;s Intensional Logic:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.978070857142857">
• The interpretation function maps a nonlogical constant of type a to an
element in its extension, instead of to a function from possible worlds to
extensions of the appropriate type as in PTQ.
• PTQ&apos;s hidden function application of evaluating the intension of a
constant, an individual concept, at an index is made explicit by
lambda-abstraction over the index and applying that term to the index of
evaluation.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999516411764706">
The first change avoids the PTQ-style detour via intensional types for interpretations
that do not need it; the second crucially affects the account of queries Clifford proposes.
The exposition is technical even for a reader initiated in PTQ, but otherwise quite clear,
although discussion and motivation follows the presentation of the formal language
and its model theory.
In Chapters 3 and 4, the tools for modeling changing states of information about
the world are presented: an historical database. Conventional databases represent static
snapshots of the world at a given moment in time, and substitution of data loses
the old information. An historical database models information about change in the
world, and old information can be retained, governed by certain constraints. Facts
are recorded with respect to a state, which `time-stamps&apos; it. Intervals come into play
in the Continuity Assumption, which requires that a fact be interpreted as true—
continuously from the time it is recorded until a different fact of the same sort is
recorded. The inferential differences between the various aspectual classes, for which
Dowty (1979) modified PTQ to evaluate formulas with respect to intervals, are said
to play no role in the intended historical database application, so expressions are
evaluated with respect to a moment in time. Hence the progressive is equivalent to

the simple past tense—all information is stative. Database attributes are functions from
moments to appropriate values in extensional domains, and IL, expresses properties of
these higher-order objects by quantifying over moments in time. Intensional queries
that use the historical database are, for instance, Has Peter&apos;s salary risen?, When was
Peter rehired?, or Has Liz ever earned the same as Peter? The meaning of intensional
predicates is defined indirectly through meaning postulates; e.g. rise is defined as true
of something if its current value is higher than the value first recorded for it during
its lifespan. Some lexical relations between nouns and verbs are encoded, but lexical
decomposition has been avoided. The database creates an object with a limited lifespan
representing the salary, as dollar amounts do not rise but salaries do (a variant of the
classical temperature puzzle in Montague&apos;s PTQ). It should be emphasized that this
notion of an historical database is an abstract theoretical concept. Implementation of
such rich databases would be prohibitively expensive, as much of the inherent data
redundancy cannot be avoided. But a small fragment has been implemented in Prolog
by Clifford, as a pilot study, along the lines of Friedman and Warren (1978).
Chapters 5, 6, and 7 present the query language QE-III, the theory of questions
underlying it, and a formal fragment with some well-chosen illustrations of the ad-
vantages of this approach. Various theories of interrogatives that have attempted to
encode some representation of the answer to a question as part of its denotation,
e.g. wh-questions denoting functions from sets of properties to sets of individuals that
have those properties, have led to a considerably complicated semantics (e.g. Kart-
tunen 1977; Hamblin 1973; Belnap 1982). On such a &apos;single-semantics&apos; approach, a
question such as Who manages John? denotes the set that contains for each x who
manages John, the proposition that x manages John. Instead, Clifford lets questions
denote propositional functions just as declarative sentences with free pronouns. The
pragmatic component accounts then for the notion of the answer to a question, using
both its syntactic and semantic analysis. For instance, Who manages whom? is given the
same semantic interpretation as He manages him, but the pragmatic interpretation of
the question is the set of n-tuples that answer it, whereas the declarative is not affected
by the pragmatic rules.
Other work on interrogatives shows a similar tendency to defer part of the in-
terpretation to the pragmatics. Clifford briefly mentions Gunji (1981) with his super-
interpreter for conversational implicatures, the PHLIQA project reported in Scha (1983),
and Hausser and Zaefferer (1978), who encode context-dependency into the semantics
by means of context-variables to account for possible redundancy of answers. But no
reference at all is made to the important work by Groenendijk and Stokhof (G&amp;S) at
the University of Amsterdam, who develop a Montegovian theory of interrogatives in
which the semantics accounts for the interpretation of a question also based on Gallin&apos;s
TY2, but type-shifting rules in a flexible type theory avoid the semantic complexities
that Clifford feared. G&amp;S employ a pragmatic component to account for the relation
between the answer and the information already available in the context of use, ac-
counting for the redundancy of a complete, exhaustive list answer in contexts where
a property answer or a partial answer may suffice. A deeper and more substantive
comparison between Clifford&apos;s account and G&amp;S should provide some interesting dif-
ferences in their empirical and theoretical consequences, and may shed further light
on the nature of the pragmatic component and its explanatory power, but such is
unfortunately beyond the scope of this book review. Other related research that also
deserves mention in this context is Engdahl&apos;s (1986) theory of interrogatives in situ-
ation semantics, work on hypothetical reasoning in Prolog by, among others, Bonner
(1988) and Gabbay (1985), and the event-based PTQ-inspired temporal semantics for
Prolog by Richards and Bethke (1989).

Clifford&apos;s excellent book is a beautiful example of a foundationally sound and
intrinsically interesting computational application of Montague semantics, presented
in all requisite detail and with much enlightened discussion of the results obtained,
their advantages, disadvantages, and essential limitations. It demonstrates again that
the value of theoretical logical research on the semantics of natural language will
prove itself in more sophisticated computational applications, offering drastic and
fundamental improvements of the existing toolkit.

A deeper and more substantive comparison between Clifford&apos;s account and G&amp;S should provide some interesting differences in their empirical and theoretical consequences, and may shed further light on the nature of the pragmatic component and its explanatory power, but such is unfortunately beyond the scope of this book review. Other related research that also deserves mention in this context is Engdahl&apos;s (1986) theory of interrogatives in situation semantics, work on hypothetical reasoning in Prolog by, among others, Bonner (1988) and Gabbay (1985), and the event-based PTQ-inspired temporal semantics for Prolog by Richards and Bethke (1989). 233 Computational Linguistics Volume 17, Number 2 Clifford&apos;s excellent book is a beautiful example of a foundationally sound and intrinsically interesting computational application of Montague semantics, presented in all requisite detail and with much enlightened discussion of the results obtained, their advantages, disadvantages, and essential limitations. It demonstrates again that the value of theoretical logical research on the semantics of natural language will prove itself in more sophisticate</context>
