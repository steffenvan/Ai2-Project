This paper presents an implemented computational model for interpreting and generating indirect
answers to yes-no questions in English. Interpretation and generation are treated, respectively,
as recognition of and construction of a responder&apos;s discourse plan for a full answer. An indirect
answer is the result of the responder providing only part of the planned response, but intending for
his discourse plan to be recognized by the questioner. Discourse plan construction and recognition
make use of shared knowledge of discourse strategies, represented in the model by discourse plan
operators. In the operators, coherence relations are used to characterize types of information
that may accompany each type of answer. Recognizing a mutually plausible coherence relation
obtaining between the actual response and a possible direct answer plays an important role in
recognizing the responder&apos;s discourse plan. During generation, stimulus conditions model a
speaker&apos;s motivation for selecting a satellite. Also during generation, the speaker uses his own
interpretation capability to determine what parts of the plan are inferable by the hearer and thus do
not need to be explicitly given. The model provides wider coverage than previous computational
models for generating and interpreting indirect answers and extends the plan-based theory of
implicature in several ways.

brackets as in (1)ii to indicate information which, in our judgment, the speaker in-

punctuation and capitalization and have omitted prosodic information from sources

will not get a car on arrival, although licensed by R&apos;s use of (1)iii in some discourse
contexts, is not a semantic consequence of the proposition that R cannot drive.
According to one study of spoken English (Stenstrom 1984) (described in Sec-
tion 2), 13% of responses to certain yes-no questions were indirect answers. Thus, a
robust dialogue system should be able to interpret indirect answers. Furthermore, there
are good reasons for generating an indirect answer instead of just a yes or no answer.
First, an indirect answer may be considered more polite than a direct answer (Brown
and Levinson 1978). For example, in (1)i, Q has indicated (by the manner in which
Q expressed the question) that Q believes it likely that R will get a car. By avoiding
explicit disagreement with this belief, the response in (1)iii would be considered more
polite than a direct answer of (1)ii. Second, an indirect answer may be more efficient
than a direct answer. For example, even if (1)ii is given, including (1)iii in R&apos;s response
contributes to efficiency by forestalling and answering a possible follow-up of well, why
not? from Q, which can be anticipated since the form of Q&apos;s question suggests that
Q may be surprised by a negative answer. Third, an indirect answer may be used to
avoid misleading Q (Hirschberg 1985), as illustrated in (2).2
(2) i. Q: Have you gotten the letters yet?
R: I&apos;ve gotten the letter from X.
This example illustrates a case in which, provided that R had gotten some but not all
of the letters in question, just yes would be untruthful and just no would be misleading
(since Q might conclude from the latter that R had gotten none of them).
We have developed a computational model, implemented in Common LISP, for
interpreting and generating indirect answers to yes-no questions in English (Green
1994). By a yes-no question we mean one or more utterances used as a request by Q
that R convey R&apos;s evaluation of the truth of a proposition p. Consisting of one or more
utterances, an indirect answer is used to convey, yet does not semantically entail, R&apos;s
evaluation of the truth of p, i.e., that p is true, that p is false, that p might be true, that
p might be false, or that p is partially true. In contrast, a direct answer entails R&apos;s eval-
uation of the truth of p. The model presupposes that Q and R mutually believe that
Q&apos;s question has been understood by R as intended by Q, that Q&apos;s question is appro-
priate, and that R can provide one of the above answers. Furthermore, it is assumed
that Q and R are engaged in a cooperative and polite task-oriented dialogue.&apos; The
model is based upon examples of uses of direct and indirect answers found in tran-
scripts of two-person telephone conversations between travel agents and their clients
(SRI 1992), examples given in previous studies (Brown and Levinson 1978; Hirschberg
1985; Kiefer 1980; Levinson 1983; Stenstrom 1984) and constructed examples reflecting
our judgments.
To give an overview of the model, generation and interpretation are treated, re-
spectively, as construction of and recognition of the responder&apos;s discourse plan spec-
ification for a full answer. In general, a discourse plan specification (for the sake of
brevity, hereafter referred to as discourse plan) explicitly relates a speaker&apos;s beliefs
and discourse goals to his program of communicative actions (Pollack 1990). Dis-
course plan construction and recognition make use of the beliefs that are presumed

and interpretation. For example in generation, it would seem to be a desirable trait for a software agent
that interacts with humans. In interpretation, it would contribute to the robustness of the interpreter.

to be shared by the participants, as well as shared knowledge of discourse strategies,
represented in the model by a set of discourse plan operators encoding generic pro-
grams of communicative actions for conveying full answers. A full answer consists
of a direct answer, which we refer to as the nucleus, and &amp;quot;extra&amp;quot; appropriate infor-
mation, which we refer to as the satellite(s).4 In the operators, coherence relations
are used to characterize types of satellites that may accompany each type of answer.
Stimulus conditions are used to characterize the speaker&apos;s motivation for including a
satellite. An indirect answer is the result of the speaker (R) expressing only part of the
planned response, i.e., omitting the direct answer (and possibly more), but intending
for his discourse plan to be recognized by the hearer (Q). Furthermore, we argue that
because of the role of interpretation in generation, Q&apos;s belief that R intended for Q to
recognize the answer is warranted by Q&apos;s recognition of the plan.
The inputs to the interpretation component of the model (a model of Q&apos;s inter-
pretation of an indirect answer) are the semantic representation of the questioned
proposition, the semantic representation of the utterances given by R during R&apos;s turn,
shared pragmatic knowledge, and Q&apos;s beliefs, including those presumed by Q to be
shared with R. (Beliefs presumed by an agent to be shared by another agent are here-
after referred to as shared beliefs, and those that are not presumed to be shared as
nonshared beliefs).5 The output is a set of alternative discourse plans that might be
ascribed to R by Q, ranked by plausibility. R&apos;s inferred discourse plan provides the
intended answer and possibly other information about R&apos;s beliefs and intentions. The
inputs to the generation component (a model of R&apos;s construction of a response) are the
semantic representation of the questioned proposition, shared pragmatic knowledge,
and R&apos;s beliefs (both shared and nonshared). The output of generation is R&apos;s discourse
plan for a full answer, including a specification of which parts of the plan do not need
to be explicitly given by R, i.e., which parts should be inferable by Q from the rest of
the answer.6
This paper describes the knowledge and processes provided in our model for
interpreting and generating indirect answers. (The model is not intended as a cogni-
tive model, i.e., we are not claiming that it reflects the participants&apos; cognitive states
during the time course of comprehension and generation. Rather, its purpose is to
compute the end products of comprehension and generation, and to contribute to a
computational theory of conversational implicature.) As background, Section 2 de-
scribes some relevant generalizations about questions and answers in English. Sec-
tion 3 describes the reversible knowledge in our model, i.e., knowledge used both in
interpretation and generation of indirect answers. Sections 4 and 5 describe the inter-
pretation and generation components, respectively. Section 5 includes a description of
additional pragmatic knowledge required for generation. Section 6 provides an eval-
uation of the work. Finally, the last section discusses future research and provides a
summary.

4 This terminology was adopted from Rhetorical Structure Theory (Mann and Thompson 1983, 1988),
discussed in Section 2.
5 Our notion of shared belief is similar to the notion of one-sided mutual belief (Clark and Marshall
1981). However, following Thomason (1990), a shared belief is merely represented in the conversational
record as if it were mutually believed, although each participant need not actually believe it.
6 However, our model does not address the interesting question of under what conditions a direct
answer should be given explicitly even when it is inferable from other parts of the response. For some
related work on the function of redundant information, see Walker (1993).

This section begins with some results of a corpus-based study of questions and re-
sponses in English that provide the motivation for the notion of a full answer in
our model. Next, we describe informally how coherence relations (similar to subject-
matter relations of Rhetorical Structure Theory [Mann and Thompson 1983, 1988]) are

2.1 Descriptive Study of Questions and Responses

<bodyText confidence="0.9995575">
Stenstrom (1984) describes characteristics of questions and responses in English, based
on her study of a corpus of 25 conversations (face-to-face and telephone). She found
that 13% of responses to polar questions (typically expressed as subject-auxilliary in-
verted questions) were indirect answers, and that 7% of responses to requests for con-
firmation (expressed as tag-questions and declaratives) were indirect.&apos; Furthermore,
she points out the similarity in function of indirect answers to the extra information,
referred to as qualify acts in her classification scheme, often accompanying direct an-
swers (Stenstrom 1984).8 StenstrOm notes that both are used

<bodyText confidence="0.998865">
In the above examples, coherence would not be affected by making the associated
direct answer explicit. She suggests that the main distinction between qualify acts and
indirect answers is the absence or presence of a direct answer.
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.744433444444444">
7 Both of these types of requests are classified as yes-no questions in our model. Also, in StenstrOm&apos;s
scheme, an utterance may be classified as performing more than one function. For example, an
utterance may be classified as both a polar question and a request for identification (i.e., an implicit
wh-question).
8 Other types of acts noted by Stenstrom as possibly accompanying direct answers, amplify and expand,
are not relevant to the problem of modeling indirect answers.
9 (3), (4), (5), and (6) are based on Stenstrom&apos;s (65), (67), (68), and (142), respectively. In (3) either a yes or
no could be conveyed, depending upon how there is interpreted and shared background knowledge
about the location of Stoke d&apos;Abemon.

Thus, in our model, the notion of a full answer is used to model both indirect
answers and direct answers accompanied by qualify acts. A full answer consists of a
direct answer, which we refer to as the nucleus, and possibly extra information of var-
ious types, which we refer to as satellites.&apos; Then, an indirect answer can be modeled
as the result of R giving one or more satellites of the full answer, without giving the
nucleus explicitly, but intending for the full answer to be recognized. A benefit of this
approach is that it also can be used to model the generation of qualify acts accom-
panying direct answers. (That is, a qualify act would be a result of R providing the
satellite(s) along with an explicit nucleus.) In the next section, we informally describe
how different types of satellites of full answers (i.e., types of indirect answers) can be
characterized.

2.2 Characterizing Types of Indirect Answers
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999824807692308">
Consider the constructed responses shown in (1) through (5) of Table 1, which are
representative of the types of full answers handled in our model.&apos; The (a) sentences
are yes-no questions and each (b) sentence expresses a possible type of direct answer.&apos;
Each of the sentences labeled (c) through (e) could accompany the preceding (b) sen-
tence in a full answer,&apos; or could be used without (b), i.e., as an indirect answer used
to convey the answer given in (b). Also, to the right of each of the (c)â(e) sentences is
a name intended to suggest the type of relation holding between that sentence and the
associated (b) sentence. For example, (1c) provides a condition for the truth of (lb),
(1d) elaborates upon (lb), and (le) provides the agent&apos;s motivation for (lb). Many of
these relations are similar to the subject-matter relations of Rhetorical Structure The-
ory (RST) (Mann and Thompson 1983, 1988), a general theory of discourse coherence.
Thus, we refer to these as coherence relations. Other sentences providing the same
type of information, i.e., satisfying the same coherence relation, could be substituted
for each (c)â(e) sentence without destroying coherence. For example, another plau-
sible condition could be substituted for (lc). Thus, as this table illustrates, a small
set of coherence relations characterizes a wide range of possible indirect answers.&apos;
Furthermore, as it illustrates, certain coherence relations are characteristic of only one
or two types of answer, e.g., giving a cause instead of yes, or an obstacle instead
of no.
To give a brief overview of Rhetorical Structure Theory as it relates to our model,
one of the goals of RST is to provide a set of relations for describing the organization of
coherent text. An RST relation is defined as a relation between two text spans, called
the nucleus and satellite. The nucleus is the span which is &amp;quot;more essential to the
writer&apos;s purpose [than the satellite is],, (Mann and Thompson 1988, 266). A relation
definition provides a set of constraints on the nucleus and satellite, and an effect
field. According to RST, implicit relational propositions are conveyed in discourse.
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.6935768">
10 As noted earlier, this terminology is borrowed from Rhetorical Structure Theory, described below.
11 Constructed examples are used here to provide a concise means of demonstrating the classes of
satellites.
12 Specifically, the possible types of direct answers handled in the model are: (lb) that p is true, (2b) that p
is false, (3b) that there is some truth to p, (4b) that p may be true, or (5b) that p may be false, where p is
the questioned proposition.
13 When more than one of the (c)â(e) sentences is used in the same response, coherence may be improved
by use of discourse connectives.
14 However, we are not claiming that this set is exhaustive, i.e., that it characterizes all possible indirect
answers.

3. Reversible Knowledge
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999954842105263">
As shown informally in the previous section, coherence relations can be used to char-
acterize various types of satellites of full answers. Coherence rules, described in Sec-
tion 3.1, provide sufficient conditions for the mutual plausibility of a coherence rela-
tion. During generation, plausibility of a coherence relation is evaluated with respect
to the beliefs that R presumes to be shared with Q. During interpretation, the same
rules are evaluated with respect to the beliefs Q presumes to be shared with R. Thus,
during generation R assumes that a coherence relation that is plausible with respect
to his shared beliefs would be plausible to Q as well. That is, Q ought to be able to
recognize the implicit relation between the nucleus and satellite.
However, the generation and interpretation of indirect answers requires additional
knowledge. For example, for R&apos;s contribution to be recognized as an answer, there
must be a discourse expectation (Levinson 1983; Reichman 1985) of an answer. Also,
during interpretation, for a particular answer to be licensed by R, the attribution of
R&apos;s intention to convey that answer must be consistent with Q&apos;s beliefs about R&apos;s
intentions. For example, a putative implicature that p holds would not be licensed
if R provides a disclaimer that it is not R&apos;s intention to convey that p holds. This
and other types of knowledge about full answers is represented as discourse plan
operators, described in Section 3.2. In our model, a discourse plan operator captures
shared, domain-independent knowledge that is used, along with coherence rules, by

16 This may seem to conflict with the idea in RST that the nucleus, being more essential to the writer&apos;s
purpose than a satellite, cannot be omitted. However, at least in the case of the coherence relations
playing a role in our model, it appears that the nucleus need not be given explicitly when it is inferable
in the discourse context.

tion is modeled as inference of R&apos;s discourse plan from R&apos;s response using the same
set of discourse plan operators and coherence rules. Inference of R&apos;s discourse plan
can account for how Q derives an implicated answer, since a discourse plan explicitly
represents the relationship of R&apos;s communicative acts to R&apos;s beliefs and intentions.
Together, the coherence rules and discourse plan operators described in this section
make up the reversible pragmatic knowledge, i.e., pragmatic knowledge used by both
the generation and interpretation components, of the model. Other pragmatic knowl-

p are propositions. (Thus, if the relational proposition is plausible to R with respect to
the beliefs that R presumes to be shared with Q, R assumes that it would be plausible
to Q, too.) To give some examples, glosses of some rules for the coherence relation,
which we refer to as cr-obstacle are given in Figure 1.17 The first rule characterizes a
subclass of cr-obstacle, illustrated in (9), relating the nonoccurrence of an agent&apos;s voli-

3.2 Discourse Plan Operators
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.990231111111111">
The discourse plan operators provided in the model encode generic programs for
expressing full answers (and subcomponents of full answers).&amp;quot; For example, the dis-
course plan operators for constructing full yes (Answer-yes) and full no (Answer-no)
answers are shown in Figure 2.&amp;quot;
The first line of a discourse plan operator, its header, e.g., (Answer-yes s h ?p), gives
the type of discourse action, the participants (s denotes the speaker and h the hearer),
and a propositional variable. (Propositional variables are denoted by symbols prefixed
with &amp;quot;?&amp;quot;.) In top-level operators such as Answer-yes and Answer-no, the header vari-
able would be instantiated with the questioned proposition. Applicability conditions,
when instantiated, specify necessary conditions for appropriate use of a discourse plan
operator.2Â° For example, the first applicability condition of Answer-yes and Answer-no
requires the speaker and hearer to share the discourse expectation that the speaker will
inform the hearer of the speaker&apos;s evaluation of the truth of the questioned proposition
p. Present in each of the five top-level answer operators, this particular applicability
condition restricts the use of these operators to contexts where an answer is expected,
18 The particular formalism we adopted to encode the operators was chosen to provide a concise and
perspicuous organization of the knowledge required for our interpretation and generation components.
We make no further claims about the formalism itself.

19 There are three other &amp;quot;top-level&amp;quot; operators in the model for expressing the remaining types of full
answers illustrated in Table 1.

but that a planner will not attempt to bring about (Carberry 1990).

and is needed to account for the hearer&apos;s attempt to interpret a response as an an-
swer, even when it is not a direct answer.&apos; The second applicability condition of the
top-level operators requires the speaker to hold the evaluation of p to be conveyed;
e.g., in Answer-no it requires that the speaker believe that p is false. The primary goals
of a discourse plan specify the discourse goals that the speaker intends for the hearer
to recognize.&apos; For example, the primary goal of Answer-yes can be glossed as the goal
that Q will accept the yes answer, at least for the purposes of the conversation.&apos;
The nucleus and satellites of a discourse plan describe primitive or nonprimitive
acts to be performed to achieve the primary goals of the plan.&apos; Inform is a primitive
act that can be realized directly. The nonprimitive acts are defined by discourse plan
operators themselves. (Thus, a discourse plan may have a hierarchical structure.) A
full answer may contain zero, one, or more instances of each type of satellite, and the
default (but not required) order of nucleus and satellites in a full answer is the order
given in the corresponding operator.
Consider the Use-elaboration and Use-obstacle discourse plan operators, shown in
Figure 3, describing possible satellites of Answer-yes and Answer-no, respectively. All
satellite operators include a second propositional variable referred to as the existential
21 Without recourse to the notion of discourse expectation, it is difficult to account for the interpretation
in (9)iii of My car&apos;s not running as The speaker is not going to campus tonight, while blocking interpretations
such as The speaker will rent a car. Note that the latter interpretation may be licensed when the discourse
expectation is that R will provide an answer to Are you going to rent a car? In general, discourse
expectations provide a contextual constraint on what inferences are licensed by the speaker. (Similarly,
it has been argued that scalar implicatures depend on the existence of a salient partially ordered set in
the discourse context; see Section 4.3.) For a discussion of the overall role of discourse expectations in
our model, see Section 4.2. One might argue that this type of applicability condition limits the
generality of the operators and thus, could lead to a proliferation of context-specific operators, which
would result in inefficient processing. First, we are not claiming that all discourse operators require this
type of applicability condition, only those operators characterizing discourse-expectation-motivated
units of discourse. Second, with an indexing scheme sensitive to discourse expectations, this would not
necessarily lead to efficiency problems.
22 We refer to these as primary to distinguish them from other discourse goals the speaker may have but
that he does not necessarily intend for the hearer to recognize.
23 During interpretation (see Section 4.1), in order for the implicat-ure to be licensed, the applicability
conditions and primary goals of any plan ascribed to R must be consistent with Q&apos;s beliefs about R&apos;s
beliefs and goals. Thus, applicability conditions and primary goals play an important role in canceling
spurious putative implicatures.
24 The discourse plan operators in our model are not intended to describe all acts that may accompany a
direct answer. For example, the model does not address the generation of parts of the response, such as
repetition or restatement, which entail the answer.

In general, each satellite operator in our model has applicability conditions and

that the relational proposition (CR q p) holds for propositions q and p instantiating the
existential variable and header variable, respectively. The second applicability condi-
tion requires that, given the beliefs that the speaker presumes to be shared with the
hearer, this relational proposition is plausible. (Mutual plausibility is evaluated using
the coherence rules described in Section 3.1.) The primary goal of a satellite operator
can be glossed as the goal that the hearer will accept the relational proposition.

Answer recognition is performed in two phases. The goal of the first phase is to derive
a set of candidate discourse plans plausibly underlying R&apos;s response. The first phase
makes use of two subcomponents: one that we refer to as the hypothesis generation
component, and a theorem prover. The output of the first phase of answer recognition
is a set of candidate discourse plans since there may be alternate interpretations of R&apos;s
response. The goal of the second phase of answer recognition is to evaluate the relative
plausibility of each candidate discourse plan. The final output of answer recognition
consists of a partially ordered set of the candidates ranked by plausibility.
Plan recognition is primarily top-down, i.e., expectation-driven. More specifically,
Q2&apos; attempts to interpret the response as having been generated from a discourse
plan constructed from the discourse plan operators for full answers. The problem of
reconstructing R&apos;s discourse plan has several aspects (to be described in more detail
shortly):

â¢ Consistency checking: determining whether the beliefs and goals that
would be attributed to R by virtue of ascribing a particular discourse
plan to R are consistent with Q&apos;s beliefs about R&apos;s beliefs and goals.
â¢ Coherence evaluation: determining whether a putative satellite of a
candidate plan is plausibly coherent, i.e., given a candidate plan&apos;s (or

Initially, the header variable of each &amp;quot;top-level&amp;quot; answer discourse plan operator&apos;
is instantiated with the questioned proposition p, i.e., all occurrences of the header
variable are replaced with p. Next, consistency checking is performed to eliminate
any candidates whose applicability conditions or primary goals are not consistent
with Q&apos;s beliefs about R&apos;s beliefs and goals. For all remaining candidates, the answer
recognizer next attempts to recognize an act from R&apos;s turn as the nucleus of the plan,
i.e., to check whether R gave a direct answer. If no acts in R&apos;s turn match the nucleus,
then the nucleus is marked as hypothesized. For all remaining acts in R&apos;s turn, the
answer recognizer attempts to recognize all possible satellites, as specified in each
remaining candidate plan. In the model the discourse plan operators do not specify a
required ordering of satellites.&apos; The subprocedure of satellite recognition is described
in more detail in Section 4.1.2.

4.1.2 Satellite Recognition. Satellite recognition is the (recursive) process of recogniz-
ing an instance of a satellite of a candidate plan. The inputs consist of:
â¢ sat-op, a discourse plan operator for a possible satellite,
â¢ the proposition p conveyed by the nucleus of the higher-level plan (i.e.,
the plan whose satellites are currently being recognized),
â¢ act-list, a list of acts in R&apos;s turn that have not yet been assimilated into
the candidate plan,
â¢ cur-act, the current act (inform s h q) in act-list, where s is the speaker, h is
the hearer, and q is the propositional content of the act.

<bodyText confidence="0.9872996">
The output is a set (possibly empty) of candidate instances of sat-op. To give a sim-
plified, preliminary version of the algorithm, first, the header variable and existential
variable of sat-op are instantiated with p and q, respectively. Then, coherence evalu-
ation and consistency checking are performed. If successful, cur-act is recognized to
27 Five of these are defined in our model, corresponding to the five types of answers illustrated in Table 1.
28 The operators do specify a preferred order, however, which is used in generation. Also, our process
model includes a structural constraint on satellite ordering. During interpretation, only instances
satisfying this constraint are considered. That is, the constraint eliminates interpretations which, in our
judgment, are not plausible due to incoherence. For a description of the constraint, see Green (1994).
We expect that other such constraints may be incorporated into the process model.

However, the satellite recognition algorithm as described so far would not be able

model directly relating (11)iv to (11)ii (or to any other direct answer that could be

Whenever the answer recognizer is unable to recognize cur-act as the nucleus of sat-op,
a subprocedure we refer to as hypothesis generation is invoked. Hypothesis genera-
tion will be described in detail in the following section. It returns a set of alternative
hypothesized propositions, each of which represents the content of a possible implicit
inform act to be inserted at the current point of expanding the candidate plan.&amp;quot; In
this example, the proposition conveyed in (11)iii would be returned as a hypothesized
proposition, which is used to instantiate the existential variable of a Use-obstacle satel-
lite, thereby enabling satellite recognition to proceed. Then, (11)iv can be recognized
(without hypothesis generation being required) as a satellite of (11)iii. Ultimately, the
plan shown in Figure 5 would be inferred. (Only the hierarchical structure and com-
municative acts are shown. By convention, the left-most child of a node is the nucleus
and its siblings are the satellites. Labels of sentences in (11) that could realize a leaf
node are used to label the node. Hypothesized nodes are indicated by square brack-
ets.) The complete satellite recognition algorithm, employing hypothesis generation,
is given in Figure 6.

29 Thus, hypothesis generation may provide additional inferences, i.e., more than just the implicated
answer. Hinkelman (1989) refers to such implicatures, licensed by attributing a plan to an agent, as

4.1.3 Hypothesis Generation. Based upon the assumption that the response is co-
herent, the goal of hypothesis generation is to fill in missing parts of a candidate
plan in such a way that an utterance in R&apos;s turn can be recognized as part of the
plan. The use of hypothesis generation broadens the coverage of our model to cases
where more is missing from a full answer than just the nucleus of a top-level op-
erator. (From the point of view of generation, it enables the construction of a more
concise, though no less informative, response.) The hypothesis generation algorithm
constructs chains of mutually plausible propositions, each beginning with the propo-
sition (e.g., the proposition conveyed in (11)iv) to be related to a goal proposition in
a candidate plan (e.g., the proposition conveyed in (11)ii), and ending with the goal
proposition, where each pair of adjacent propositions in the chain is linked by a plau-
sible coherence relation. The algorithm returns the proposition (e.g., the proposition
conveyed in (11)iii) immediately preceding the goal proposition in each chain. Thus,
when top-down recognition has reached an impasse, hypothesis generation (a type of
bottom-up data-driven reasoning) provides a hypothesis that enables top-down recog-
nition to continue another level of growth. An example of hypothesis generation is
given in Section 4.1.5.
The algorithm for hypothesis generation, which is given in Figure 7, performs a
breadth-first search subject to a processing constraint on the maximum depth of the
search tree. Note that a chain may have a length greater than three, e.g., the chain
may consist of propositions (po, pi, P2, p3), where po is the proposition to be related
to the candidate plan, 193 is the goal, and p2 would be returned as a hypothesized
proposition. In such a case, after p2 has been assimilated into the candidate plan, if pi
is not present in R&apos;s turn, then hypothesis generation is invoked again and pi would

4.1.4 Ranking Candidate Plans. Two heuristics are used to rank the relative plausi-
bility of the set of candidate plans output by the first phase of answer recognition.
First, plausibility decreases as the number of hypotheses in a candidate increases.
(Assuming that all else is equal, it is safer to favor interpretations requiring fewer
hypotheses.) Second, plausibility increases as the number of utterances in R&apos;s turn
that are accounted for by the plan increases. (The more of R&apos;s turn accounted for, the
more coherent the turn is likely to be, although not all of the utterances in R&apos;s turn are
necessarily part of the full answer.) To give an example, consider the two candidate
plans shown in Figure 8, corresponding to alternative interpretations of R&apos;s response
in (12).31

30 The implementation saves the chains to avoid the expense of recomputing intermediate hypotheses.
31 This constructed example was designed to illustrate multiple aspects of the model. In our judgement,
normally it would sound more coherent to give (12)v before (12)iv if (12)vi were not included.
However, when (12)vi is included, (12)v not only elaborates upon the yes, but also serves as
background for (12)vi. Another possible motivation for giving (12)v after (12)iv might be to delay
giving dispreferred information (Levinson 1983), e.g., if the speaker believed that a yes was an
unexpected or unwanted answer to (12)i.

By these heuristics, a yes answer would be the preferred interpretation, since the candi-
date Answer-yes plan uses the same number of hypotheses as the candidate Answer-no
plan, and accounts for more of R&apos;s response. ((12)vi is not recognized as part of ei-
ther answer.) The preference heuristics are intended to capture local coherence only.
Since global information may play a role in selecting the correct interpretation, the
higher-level discourse processor (described in section 4.2) must decide which plan to
attribute to the speaker.
4.1.5 Answer Recognition Example. In this section, we illustrate the interpretation of
indirect answers in the model by describing how the two candidate plans shown in
Figure 8 would be derived from R&apos;s response of (12)iv through (12)vi. First, each of the
five top-level answer discourse plan operators would be instantiated with the ques-
tioned proposition p, the proposition that R is going to campus tonight. Assuming that
Q has no beliefs about R&apos;s beliefs and goals that are inconsistent with the applicability
conditions and primary goals of these candidates, none of the candidates would be
eliminated yet. Second, for each candidate the recognizer would check whether the
communicative act specified in the nucleus was present in R&apos;s turn. In this example,
since a direct answer was not explicitly provided by R, the recognizer would mark the
nucleus of each candidate as hypothesized. The hypothesized nucleus of the candidate
Answer-no and Answer-yes plans would be (inform s h (not p)) and (inform s h p), respec-
tively. Next, the recognizer would try to recognize the acts expressed as (12)iv through
(12)vi as satellites of each candidate plan. Assume that these acts are represented as
(inform s h NO, (inform s h pv), and (inform s h pv,), respectively.
To recognize an instance of a satellite, first, a satellite discourse plan operator
would be instantiated. The header variable would be instantiated by unifying the
satellite plan header with the corresponding act in the higher-level plan. For example,
the header variable of a Use-obstacle satellite of an Answer-no candidate would be in-
stantiated with (not p) in this example. The existential variable would be instantiated
with the proposition conveyed in some utterance to be recognized as a satellite, e.g.,
piz,. However, before a candidate satellite may be attached to the higher-level candi-
date plan, the answer recognizer must verify that the candidate satellite passes the
following two tests: First, the candidate satellite&apos;s applicability conditions and pri-
mary goals must be consistent with Q&apos;s beliefs about R&apos;s beliefs and goals. Second,
the specified coherence relation must be plausible with respect to the beliefs that Q
presumes to be shared with R, i.e., the satellite&apos;s instantiated applicability condition

of the form (Plausible (CR q p)) must be provable using the coherence rules described
in Section 3. For example, given the beliefs that Q presumes to be shared with R and
the coherence rules provided in the model, the act underlying (12)iv could not be the
nucleus of a candidate Use-obstacle satellite of the Answer-no candidate, because the
recognizer would not be able to prove that cr-obstacle is a plausible coherence relation
holding between p,â and (not p). On the other hand, the act underlying (12)v would
be interpreted as the nucleus of a candidate Use-elaboration satellite of the Answer-yes
candidate, since the above tests are satisified, e.g., the recognizer could prove that
cr-elaboration is a plausible coherence relation holding between p, and p.
To return to consideration of the recognition of the Answer-no candidate, upon
finding that the act underlying (12)iv cannot serve as a satellite, hypothesis genera-
tion would be attempted. Recall that the goal of hypothesis generation is to supply
a hypothesized missing act of the plan so that top-down recognition can continue.
Hypothesis generation would search for a chain of plausibly related propositions, be-
ginning with the proposition (i.e., ph) to be related to the candidate Answer-no plan,
and ending with the goal proposition (i.e., (not p)). As mentioned in Section 4.1.3, each
pair of adjacent propositions in the chain must be linked by a plausible coherence re-
lation. In this example, hypothesis generation would construct the chain (p,â Piji, (not
p)), where both pairs of adjacent propositions would be related by cr-obstacle and piii
is the hypothesis that R&apos;s car is not running. Hypothesis generation would return the
proposition immediately preceding the goal proposition in this chain, i.e., phi. Thus,
phi would be used to instantiate the existential variable of a Use-obstacle satellite of the
Answer-no candidate plan, and satellite recognition would proceed. (The nucleus of this
satellite would be marked as hypothesized.) Then, the recognizer would recognize Piz,
(without requiring hypothesis generation) as a Use-obstacle satellite of this Use-obstacle
satellite. No remaining utterances in R&apos;s turn can be related to the candidate Answer-no
plan, resulting in the candidate shown on the left in Figure 8.
Finally, to finish consideration of the recognition of the Answer-yes candidate, since
neither the act underlying (12)iv nor the act underlying (12)vi can serve as a satellite of
the Answer-yes candidate or its Use-elaboration satellite, hypothesis generation would
again be invoked. Hypothesis generation would provide ph,, the hypothesis that R&apos;s car
is not running, as a plausible explanation for why R is going to take the bus. Thus, phi
would be used to instantiate the existential variable of a Use-cause satellite of the Use-
elaboration satellite of the Answer-yes candidate plan, and satellite recognition would
proceed. (The nucleus of the Use-cause satellite would be marked as hypothesized.)
Then, the recognizer would recognize pi, (without requiring hypothesis generation) as
a Use-cause satellite of this Use-cause satellite. No remaining utterances in R&apos;s turn can
be related to the candidate Answer-yes plan, resulting in the candidate shown on the
right in Figure 8.
Given the shared beliefs and the coherence rules provided in the model, none of
the utterances in R&apos;s turn would be recognized as satellites of the other three top-
level candidate answer plans. Candidates that do not account for any actual parts
of the response are eliminated at the end of phase one. Thus the output of phase
one of interpretation would be just the two candidates shown in Figure 8. Phase
two would evaluate the Answer-yes candidate as more preferred than the Answer-no
candidate, since the former interpretation requires the same number of hypotheses
and also accounts for more of R&apos;s response.

In Carberry&apos;s discourse-processing model for ellipsis interpretation (Carberry 1990),
a mechanism is provided for updating the shared discourse expectations of dialogue
participants throughout a conversation. Our answer recognizer would have the follow-
ing role in such an architecture: The answer recognizer would be invoked whenever
the current discourse expectation is that R will provide an answer. (If answer recog-
nition were unsuccessful, then the discourse processor would invoke other types of
recognizers for other types of responses.) The answer recognizer returns a partially
ordered set (possibly empty) of answer discourse plans that it is plausible to ascribe
to R as underlying (part or all of) the turn. The final choice of which discourse plan
to ascribe to R should be made by the higher-level discourse processor, since it must
select an interpretation consistent with the rest of the discourse.

4.3 Comparison to Previous Approaches to Conversational Implicature
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999945125">
Grice (1975) has proposed a theory of conversational implicature to account for certain
types of conversational inferences. According to Grice, a speaker may convey more
than the conventional meaning of an utterance by making use of the hearer&apos;s expec-
tation that the speaker is adhering to general principles of cooperative conversation.
Two necessary (but not sufficient) properties of conversational implicatures involve
cancelability and speaker intention (Grice 1975; Hirschberg 1985). First, potential con-
versational implicatures may be canceled explicitly, i.e., disavowed by the speaker in
the preceding or subsequent discourse context, or even canceled implicitly given a
particular set of shared beliefs. In fact, potential implicatures may undergo a change
in status from cancelable to noncancelable in the subsequent discourse (Gunji 1981).
Second, conversational implicatures are part of the intended meaning of an utter-
ance. Grice proposes several maxims of cooperative conversation that a hearer uses as
justification for inferring conversational implicatures. However, Grice&apos;s theory is inad-
equate as the basis for a computational model of how conversational implicatures are
derived. As frequently noted, Grice&apos;s maxims may support spurious or contradictory
inferences. To date, few computational models have addressed the interpretation of
conversational implicatures.
Hirschberg&apos;s model (Hirschberg 1985) addresses a class of conversational impli-
catures, scalar implicatures, which overlaps with the class of implicated answers ad-
dressed in our model. (That is, scalar implicatures arise in question-answer exchanges
as well as in other contexts, and, not all types of implicated answers are scalar im-
plicatures.) According to Hirschberg, a scalar implicature depends upon the existence
of a partially ordered set of values that is salient in the discourse context. Her model
provides licensing rules that specify, given such a set, which scalar implicatures are

It is mutually plausible to the agent that (cr-contrast q p*) holds,
where q is a proposition
and p* is the proposition that p is partly true,
if the agent believes it to be mutually believed that q is less than p in a salient partial order,
unless it is mutually believed that p is true or that q is not true.

licensed in terms of values in the set that are lower than, alternate to, or higher than
the value referred to in an utterance. For example, given a salient partially ordered
set such that the value for the letter from X is lower than the value for all of the letters in

not gotten all of the letters in question.

In our model, the response in (14)ii would be analyzed as generated from an Answer-
hedge discourse plan whose nucleus has not been explicitly given and which has a
single Use-contrast satellite whose nucleus is expressed in (14)ii.32 The coherence rules
for cr-contrast, which are based upon the notions elucidated by Hirschberg, are glossed
in Figure 9.33 However, the discourse plan operators in our model also characterize a
variety of indirect answers that are not scalar implicatures, i.e., indirect answers based
on the other coherence relations shown in Table 2.
A model such as Hirschberg&apos;s, which does not take the full response into account,
faces certain problems in handling cancellation by the subsequent discourse context
(&amp;quot;backwards&amp;quot; cancellation). For example, given a salient partially ordered set such that
going to campus is ranked as an alternate to going shopping, Hirschberg&apos;s model would
predict, correctly in the case of (15) and incorrectly in the case of (16), that R intended
to convey a no.

In our model, (16) would be interpreted by recognizing an Answer-yes plan (with a
Use-elaboration and a Use-cause satellite underlying (16)iii and (16)iv, respectively) as
more plausible than an Answer-no plan, rather than by use of backwards cancellation.&apos;
In other words, in our model subsequent context can provide evidence for or against
a particular interpretation, since a discourse plan may be expressed by multiple utter-
ances.
Also, a model such as Hirschberg&apos;s provides no explanation for why potential im-
plicatures may become noncancelable. Our model predicts that a potential implicature
of an utterance becomes noncancelable after the point in the conversation when the
full discourse plan accounting for that utterance has been attributed to the speaker.
For example, imagine a situation in which Q and R mutually intend to discuss two job
candidates, A and B. Also, suppose that they mutually believe that they should not
discuss any candidate until two letters of recommendation have been received for the
candidate, and further, that both letters for B have been received. Our model predicts
that the scalar implicature potentially licensed in (17)ii (i.e., that R has not gotten both
letters for A yet) is no longer cancelable after R&apos;s turn in (17)iv, since by that point, the
participants apparently would share the belief that Q had succeeded in recognizing
R&apos;s discourse plan underlying (17)ii.35

Inference of coherence relations has been used in modeling temporal (Lascarides
and Asher 1991; Lascarides, Asher, and Oberlander 1992) and other defeasible dis-
course inferences (Hobbs 1978; Dahlgren 1989). Inference of plausible coherence re-
lations is necessary but not sufficient for interpreting indirect answers. For example,
Q also must believe that there is a shared discourse expectation of an answer to a
particular question. In other words, in our model, discourse plans provide additional
constraints on the beliefs and intentions of the speaker that a hearer uses in interpret-
ing a response. Another limitation of the above approaches is that they provide no
explanation for the phenomenon of loss of cancelability described above.
Plan recognition has been used to model the interpretation of indirect speech acts
(Perrault and Allen 1980; Hinkelman 1989) and ellipsis (Carberry 1990; Litman 1986),
discourse phenomena that share with conversational implicature the two necessary
conditions described above, cancelablity and speaker intention. However, these models
are inadequate for interpreting indirect answers, i.e., for deriving an implicated answer
p from an indirect answer q. In these models, for p to be derivable from q, it is necessary

be inferred as equally plausible in our model. Although prosodic information is not used in our model,
it is an interesting question for future research whether it can help in recognizing the speaker&apos;s
intentions in such cases.

for the hearer to infer that the speaker is performing or at least constructing a domain
plan relating p and q. However, q need not play such a role in the speaker&apos;s inferred or

a domain plan involving the renting of a car by X in order to recognize R&apos;s intention

In other words, these models lack requisite knowledge encoded in our model in terms
of possible satellites (based on coherence relations) of top-level discourse plan opera-
tors. Also, the above plan-based models face the same problems as Hirschberg&apos;s since
they do not address multiutterance responses.
Philosophers (Thomason 1990; McCafferty 1987) have argued for a plan-based
theory of implicature as an alternative to Grice&apos;s theory. Thomason proposes that im-
plicatures are comprehended by a process of accommodation of the conversational
record to fit the inferred plans of the speaker. According to McCafferty, &amp;quot;implicatures
are things that the speaker plans that the hearer believe (and that the hearer can realize
that the speaker plans that the hearer believe)&amp;quot; (p. 18). He claims that a theory based
upon inferring the speaker&apos;s plan avoids the problem of predicting spurious impli-
catures, since the spurious implicature would not be part of the speaker&apos;s plan. Our
model is consistent with this view of conversational implicature. McCafferty sketches
a possible plan-based model to account for the implicated yes answer in (19).37

Although it was not McCafferty&apos;s intention to provide a computational model, but
rather to show the plausibility of a plan-based theory of conversational implicature,
some limitations of his suggestions for developing a computational model should be
noted. First, his proposed rules cannot be used to derive an alternate, plausible inter-
pretation of (19)iii, in which R scalar implicates a no.&apos; Our model can account for both
interpretations. The first interpretation would be accounted for by an inferred Answer-
yes plan with a Use-elaboration satellite underlying (19)iii, while the latter would be
accounted for by an inferred Answer-no plan with a Use-contrast satellite underlying
(19)iii. More generally, his proposed rules cannot account for types of indirect an-
swers described in our model by coherence relations whose definitions do not involve
planning knowledge. Second, even if rules could be added to McCafferty&apos;s model to
account for a speaker&apos;s plan to convey a no by use of (19)iii, his model does not pro-
vide a way of using information from other parts of the response, e.g., (20)iv, to help
recognize the intended answer. As noted earlier, in our model such information can

4.4 Summary
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999991428571428">
This section closes with a summary of the argument for the adequacy of our model
as a model of conversational implicature. As discussed earlier, two necessary condi-
tions for conversational implicature are cancelability and speaker intention. We have
demonstrated that our model can handle forward and backward cancellation, and pro-
vides an explanation for the &amp;quot;loss of cancelability&amp;quot; phenomenon. Regarding speaker
intention, in our model a conversationally implicated answer is an answer that R
planned that Q recognize (and that Q recognizes that R planned that Q recognize).&apos;
We have demonstrated how Q&apos;s recognition of R&apos;s discourse plan (in particular, the
goal to provide an answer to the question) can be performed using the knowledge and
algorithms in our model. Furthermore, we argue that Q&apos;s recognition of R&apos;s intention
that Q recognize R&apos;s plan follows from the role of interpretation in generation, namely,
Q and R mutually believe that R will not say what he does unless R believes that Q
will be able to interpret the response as intended. In our model, during generation
(to be described in Section 5), R constructs a model of Q&apos;s beliefs (using R&apos;s shared
beliefs), and then simulates Q&apos;s interpretation of a trial pruned response. R&apos;s decision
to use the pruned response depends upon whether R believes that Q would still be
able to recognize the answer after the plan has been pruned. During interpretation,
given the shared discourse expectation that R will provide an answer to Q&apos;s yes-no
question, Q&apos;s use of (Q&apos;s) shared beliefs to interpret the response, and Q&apos;s belief that R
expects that Q will be able to recognize the answer, Q&apos;s recognition of a discourse plan
for an answer warrants Q&apos;s belief that R intended for Q to recognize this intention.

This section describes our approach to the generation of indirect answers. Genera-
tion is modeled as a two-phase process of discourse plan construction. First, in the
content planning phase, a discourse plan for a full answer is constructed. Second,
the plan pruning phase uses the model&apos;s own interpretation capability to determine
what information in the full response does not need to be stated explicitly. In ap-
propriate discourse contexts, i.e., in contexts where the direct answer can be inferred
by Q from other parts of the full answer, a plan for an indirect answer is thereby
generated. When the direct answer must be given explicitly, the result is a plan for a
direct answer accompanied by appropriate extra information. (According to the study
mentioned in Section 2 [Stenstrom 1984], 85% of direct answers are accompanied by
such information. Thus, it is important to model this type of response as well.)
While the pragmatic knowledge described in Section 3 is sufficient for interpreta-
tion, it is not sufficient for the problem of content planning during generation. Applica-

Furthermore, a full answer might be too verbose if every satellite whose applicability
conditions held were included in the full answer. On the other hand, at the time when
he is asked a question, R may not hold the primary goals of a potential satellite. (In our
model the only goal R is assumed to have initially is the goal to provide the answer.)
Thus, an approach to selecting satellites driven only by these satellite goals would fail.
To overcome these problems, we have augmented the satellite discourse plan oper-
ators, as described in Section 3, with one or more stimulus conditions. Two examples
are shown in Figure 10. Stimulus conditions describe general types of situations in
which a speaker is motivated to include a satellite during plan construction. They can
be thought of as situational triggers, which give rise to new speaker goals (i.e., the
primary goals of the satellite operator), and which are the compiled result of deeper
planning based upon principles of cooperativity (Grice 1975) or politeness (Brown
and Levinson 1978).&apos; In order for a satellite to be included, all of its applicability
conditions and at least one of its stimulus conditions must be true.

Levinson claims that prerequests are used to check whether the planned request (in T3)
is likely to succeed so that a dispreferred response to it can be avoided by Q. Another
reason is that, since receiving an offer is preferred to making a request (Schegloff 1979),
by making a prerequest, Q gives R the opportunity to offer whatever Q would request
in T3, i.e., the sequence would then consist of just Ti and T4. In analyses based on
speech act theory, in a sequence consisting of just Ti and T4, the prerequest would be
referred to as an indirect speech act.
5.1.2 Explanation for Unexpected Answer. Stenstrom notes that a reason for pro-
viding extra information is to provide an explanation justifying a negative answer.&amp;quot;
According to Levinson (1983), the presence of an explanation is a distinguishing fea-
ture of dispreferred responses to questions and other second parts of adjacency pairs
(Schegloff 1972). In an adjacency pair, each member of the pair is produced by a differ-
ent speaker, and the occurrence of the first part creates the expectation that the second
part will appear, although not necessarily immediately following the first member.
Levinson claims that dispreferred responses to first parts of adjacency pairs can be
identified by structural features such as:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9982824">
â¢ use of pauses or displacement,
â¢ prefacing with markers (e.g. uh or well), appreciations, apologies, or
refusals,
â¢ providing explanations, and
â¢ declinations given in an indirect or mitigated manner.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.75193725">
For example in (23),45 the marker well is used and an explanation is given.
(23) i. Q: What about coming here on the way or doesn&apos;t that give you
enough time?
R: Well no I&apos;m supervising here
Although Levinson defines preference in terms of structural features, he notes that
there is a correlation between preference and content. For example, unexpected an-
swers to questions, refusals of requests and offers, and admissions of blame are typi-
cally marked with features from the above list.

5.1.3 Avoid Misunderstanding. Stenstrom notes that extra information may be given
to qualify an answer. Hirschberg (1985) claims that speakers may give indirect answers
to block potential unintended scalar implicatures of a yes or no alone. For example in
(2), repeated below as (24), R&apos;s response is preferable to just no, since that would license
the incorrect scalar implicature that R had not received any of the letters in question.
However, by use of (24)ii in an appropriate discourse context, R is able to convey
explicitly which letter has been received as well as to conversationally implicate that
R has not gotten the other letters in question.

sons. Kiefer notes that extra information may be given as an excuse when the answer
indicates that the speaker has failed to fulfill a social obligation. Brown and Levinson
(1978) claim that politeness strategies, which may at times conflict with Gricean max-
ims, account for many uses of language. According to Brown and Levinson, certain
communicative acts are intrinsically face-threatening acts (FTAs). That is, doing an
FTA is likely to injure some conversational participant&apos;s face, or public self-image.
For example, orders and requests threaten the recipient&apos;s negative face, &amp;quot;the want ...
that his actions be unimpeded by others&amp;quot; (p. 67). On the other hand, disagreement or
bearing &amp;quot;bad news&amp;quot; threatens the speaker&apos;s positive face, the want to be looked upon
favorably by others. Further, they claim that politeness strategies can be ranked, and
that the greater the threat associated with a face-threatening act, the more motivated
a speaker is to use a higher-numbered strategy.
Brown and Levinson propose the following ranked set of strategies (listed in order
from lower to higher rank):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.96033525">
1. perform the FTA. (Brown and Levinson claim that this amounts to
following Gricean maxims.)
2. perform the FTA with redressive action, i.e., in a manner that indicates
that no face threat is intended, using positive politeness strategies
(strategies that increase the hearer&apos;s positive face). Such strategies
include:
Strategy 1: attending to the hearer&apos;s interests or needs
Strategy 6: avoiding disagreement, e.g., by displacing an answer
3. perform the FTA with redressive action, using negative politeness
strategies (strategies for increasing negative face). These include:
Strategy 6: giving an excuse or an apology
4. perform the FTA off-record, i.e., by use of conversational implicature.

In the next section, we provide several stimulus conditions that reflect positive po-
liteness strategy 1 and negative politeness strategy 6. However, although politeness
considerations may motivate a speaker to convey an answer indirectly, it is beyond
the scope of our generation model to choose between a direct and an indirect answer
on this basis.

In this section we provide glosses of rules giving sufficient conditions for the stim-
ulus conditions used in our model. (The rules are encoded as Horn clauses in our
implementation of the model.) Table 3 summarizes which stimulus conditions appear
in which discourse plan operators. As mentioned above, for an instance of a satellite
operator to be selected during generation, all of its applicability conditions and at least
one of its stimulus conditions must hold.
5.2.1 Explanation-indicated. This stimulus condition appears in all of the operators
for providing causal explanations. For example in (1), repeated below as (25), R gives
an explanation of why R won&apos;t get a car.

iii. I can&apos;t drive.
R&apos;s response may contribute to greater dialogue efficiency by anticipating a follow-up
request for an explanation. The rule for this stimulus condition may be glossed as: (a
speaker) s is motivated to give (a hearer) h an explanation for (not p), if s suspects that
h suspects that (a proposition) p is true, unless it is the case that s has reason to believe
that h will accept (not p) on s&apos;s authority. s may acquire the suspicion that h suspects
that p is true by means of syntactic clues from the yes-no question, e.g., from the form
of the question in (25)i.
5.2.2 Excuse-indicated. Although this stimulus condition appears in some of the same
causal operators as explanation-indicated, it represents a different kind of motivation.

A yes-no question may be interpreted as a prerequest. Thus, a negative answer to a
yes-no question used as a prerequest may be interpreted as a refusal. To soften the
refusal, i.e., in accordance with negative politeness strategy 6, the speaker may give
an explanation of the negative answer, as illustrated in (21), repeated below in (26).

Although Q may not have intended to use (29)i as a prerequest for the question What
Verdi operas do you have?, R suspects that the answer to this wh-question might be
helpful to Q, and so provides it (in accordance with positive politeness strategy 1).
The rule for this stimulus condition may be glossed as: s is motivated to provide h
with q, if s suspects that it would be helpful for h to know the referent of a term t in
q. The rule&apos;s antecedent would hold whenever obstacle detection techniques (Allen

an inferred plan of h&apos;s. However, not all helpful responses, in the sense described in
Allen and Perrault (1980), can be used as indirect answers. For example, even if the
clerk (R) at the music store believes that Q&apos;s not knowing the closing time could be
an obstacle to Q&apos;s buying a recording, a response of (30) alone would not convey no

(33) i. Q: Have you gotten the letters yet?

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.996615055555556">
On the strict interpretation of (33)i, Q is asking whether R has gotten all of the letters,
but on a looser interpretation, Q is asking if R has gotten any of the letters. Then, if
R has gotten some but not all of the letters, just yes would be untruthful. However, if
Q is speaking loosely, then just no might lead Q to erroneously conclude that R has
not gotten any of the letters. R&apos;s answer circumvents this problem, by conveying the
extent to which the questioned proposition (on the strict interpretation) is true.
The rules for this stimulus condition may be glossed as: s is motivated to clarify to
h the extent q to which p is true, or the alternative q to p which is true, if s suspects that
h does not know if q holds, and s believes that q is the highest expression alternative to
p that does hold. According to Hirschberg (1985) (following Gazdar), sentences p, and
pi (representing the propositional content of two utterances) are expression alternatives
if they are the same except for having comparable components e, and ej, respectively.
As mentioned earlier, Hirschberg claims that in a discourse context there may be a
partial ordering of values that the discourse participants mutually believe to be salient.
She claims that the ranking of ei and ei in this ordering can be used to describe the
ranking of pi and pl. In the above example, (33)ii is a realization of the highest true
expression alternative to the questioned proposition, p, i.e., the proposition that R has

In (34), R conveys that there is some (though not much) truth to the questioned propo-
sition in an effort to soften his answer (in accordance with positive politeness strategy
1). More than one stimulus condition may motivate R to include the same satellite.
For example, in (34), R may have been motivated also by clarify-extent-indicated, which
was described above. However, it is possible to provide a context for (35) where
appeasement-indicated holds but clarify-extent-indicated does not, or a context for (34)

heuristic rules and stereotypical and specific knowledge about h&apos;s desires. For example,
two heuristics of rational agency that might lead to beliefs about h&apos;s desires are 1) if
an agent wants you to perform an action A, then your failure to perform A may be
undesirable to the agent, and 2) if an agent wants you to do A, then it is desirable to
the agent that you perform a part of A.
5.2.9 Summary. In summary, the stimulus conditions in our model can be classified
according to three general principles, as shown in Table 4. The first category, effi-
ciency, includes the motivation to provide implicitly requested information as well
as to provide an explanation for unexpected information. In other words, giving this
type of extra information contributes to the efficiency of the conversation by elimi-
nating the need for follow-up wh-questions or follow-up why? or why not? questions,
respectively. In the category of accuracy, in addition to the reason cited by Hirschberg
(which is represented in our model as clarify-extent-indicated), we have identified two
other reasons for giving extra information, which contribute to accuracy. The category
of politeness includes reasons for redressing face-threatening acts using positive and
negative politeness strategies.

â¢ the set of discourse plan operators (described in Section 3) augmented
with stimulus conditions,
â¢ the set of coherence rules (also described in Section 3),

The model presupposes that when answer generation begins, the speaker&apos;s (R&apos;s) only
goal is to satisfy the above discourse expectation. R&apos;s nonshared beliefs (including
beliefs whose strength is not necessarily certainty) about Q&apos;s beliefs, intentions, and
preferences are used in generation to evaluate whether a stimulus condition holds.
The output of the generation algorithm is a discourse plan that can be realized by a
tactical generation component (McKeown 1985).&apos;
53 The plan that is output specifies an ordering of discourse acts based upon the ordering of coherence
relations specified in the discourse plan operators. However, reordering may be required, e.g., to model
a speaker who has multiple goals.

The answer generation algorithm has two phases. In the first phase, content plan-
ning, the generator creates a discourse plan for a full answer, i.e., a direct answer
and extra appropriate information. In the second phase, plan pruning, the generator
determines which propositions of the planned full answer do not need to be explic-
itly stated. For example, given an appropriate model of R&apos;s beliefs, the system would
generate a plan for asserting only the proposition conveyed in (36)v and (36)vi as an
answer to (36)i.m

[He&apos;s at home.]
iv. [He is caring for his daughter.]
v. His daughter has the measles,
vi. but he&apos;s logged on.
An advantage of this approach is that, even when it is not possible to omit the direct
answer, a full answer is generated.
5.3.1 Content Planning. Content planning is performed by top-down expansion of an
answer discourse plan operator. First, each top-level answer discourse plan operator
is instantiated with the questioned proposition until one is found such that its applica-
bility conditions hold.&apos; Next, the satellites of this operator are expanded (recursively).
The algorithm for expanding a satellite adds each instance of a satellite such that all
of its applicability conditions and at least one of its stimulus conditions hold. Thus,
different instantiations of the same type of satellite may be included in a plan for
different reasons. For example, (36)iii and (36)vi both realize Use-contrast satellites, the
former included due to the answer-ref-indicated stimulus condition, and the latter due
to the substitute-indicated stimulus condition.
For each stimulus condition of a satellite, our implementation of the algorithm
uses a theorem prover to search the set of R&apos;s beliefs (encoded as Horn clauses)
for a proposition satisfying a formula consisting of a conjunction of the applicability
conditions and that stimulus condition. A proposition satisfying each such formula
is used to instantiate the existential variable of the satellite operator. For example,
to generate the response in (36), the following formula would be constructed from
the Use-contrast operator&apos;s applicability conditions and one of its stimulus conditions,
(answer-ref-indicated), where p is the proposition that Mark is at the office, and ?q is the
existential variable to be instantiated.
((and (bel s (cr-contrast ?q (not p)))
(Plausible (cr-contrast ?q (not p)))
(answer-ref-indicated s h ?q)))
The result of the search is to instantiate ?q with the proposition that Mark is at home,
due to the speaker&apos;s belief that the hearer might have been using (36)i as a prerequest

for the question, Where is Mark? For a more complete description of how R&apos;s response
in (36) is generated, see Section 5.4.
We have employed a simple approach to planning because the focus of our re-
search was on the use of the response as an indirect answer, i.e., on aspects of response
generation that play a role in interpreting the implicature. In a more sophisticated dis-
course planning formalism, such as argued for in Young, Moore, and Pollack (1994), it
would be possible to represent and reason about other intended effects of the response.
(In our model, the effects or primary goals are used in interpretation but their only
role in generation is in simulated interpretation. However, their role in interpretation is
important; they constrain what discourse plans can be ascribed to the speaker.) While
we believe that use of more sophisticated planning formalisms is well motivated for
discourse generation in general, we leave the problem of generating indirect answers
in such formalisms for future research. The use of stimulus conditions to motivate the
selection of optional satellite operators is sufficient for our current goals.

plan representing a full answer, is the input to the plan pruning phase of generation.
The expanded plan is represented as a tree of discourse acts. The goal of this phase is
to make the response more concise, i.e., to determine which of the planned acts can be
omitted while still allowing Q to infer the full discourse plan.&apos; To do this, the generator
considers each of the acts in the frontier of the tree from right to left. (This ensures that
a satellite is considered before its related nucleus.) The generator creates a trial plan
consisting of the original plan minus the nodes pruned so far and minus the current
node. Then, using the answer recognizer, the generator simulates Q&apos;s interpretation of
a response containing the information that would be given explicitly according to the
trial plan. In the simulation, R&apos;s shared beliefs are used to model Q&apos;s shared beliefs.
If Q could infer the full plan (as the most preferred interpretation), then the current
node can be pruned. Otherwise, it is left in the plan and the next node is considered.
For example, consider Figure 11 as we illustrate the possible effect of pruning
on a full discourse plan. The leaf nodes, representing discourse acts, are numbered 1
through 8. Arcs labeled N and S lead to a nucleus or satellite, respectively. Node 8
corresponds to the direct answer. Plan pruning would process the nodes in order from
1 to 8. The maximal set of nodes that could be pruned in Figure 11 is the set containing
2, 3, 4, 7, and 8. That is, nodes 2 through 4 might be inferable from 1, node 7 from 5
or 6, and node 8 from 4 or 7, but nodes 1, 5, and 6 cannot be pruned since they are
not inferable from other nodes.&apos; In the event that it is determined that no node can
be pruned, the full plan would be output. The interpretation algorithm (described in
Section 4) would use hypothesis generation to recognize missing propositions other
than the direct answer, i.e., the propositions at nodes 2, 3, 4, and 7.
To comment on the role of interpretation in generation, it is a key component of our
claim to have provided an adequate model of conversational implicature. Given the
shared discourse expectation that R will provide an answer to Q&apos;s yes-no question, Q&apos;s
use of (Q&apos;s) shared beliefs to interpret the response, and Q&apos;s belief that R expects that Q
will be able to recognize the answer, Q&apos;s recognition of a discourse plan for an answer
warrants Q&apos;s belief that R intended for Q to recognize this intention. In particular, R
would not have pruned the direct answer unless, given the beliefs that R presumes

56 Conciseness is not the only possible motive for omitting the direct answer. As mentioned earlier, an
indirect answer may be used to avoid performing a face-threatening act. However, it is beyond the
scope of our model to determine whether to omit the direct answer on grounds of politeness.
57 In fact, leaves that have no satellites of their own cannot be pruned.

to be shared with Q, R believes that Q will be able to recognize a chain of mutually
plausible coherence relations from the actual response to the intended answer, and
thus be able to recognize R&apos;s plan. Note that although stimulus conditions are not
recognized during interpretation in our approach, the model does account for the
recognition of those parts of the plan concerning the answer. For example, although
Q may not know whether R was motivated by excuse-indicated or explanation-indicated
to provide (21)iv in response to (21)ii, Q can recognize R&apos;s intention to convey a no
by Q&apos;s recognition of (21)iv as the nucleus of a Use-Obstacle satellite of Answer-No.
Thus, Q can thereby attribute to R the primary goal of the Answer-No plan to convey
a no.

be selected for expansion since its applicability conditions can be proven. To expand
this plan, the algorithm attempts to expand each of its satellites as described in Sec-

of each subtree has been annotated with a sequence number to show the order in
which a subtree is visited in the bottom-up traversal of the tree, i.e., 1 through 5.
Since subtree 1 has no satellites (only a nucleus), the traversal moves to subtree 2.
For the same reason, the traversal moves to subtree 3. Next, the nucleus of subtree
3 is tentatively pruned, i.e., a trial response consisting of the direct answer plus (a),
(c), and (d) is created. Simulated interpretation of this trial response results in the
inference of a discourse plan identical to the full plan as the most preferred (in fact,
the only) interpretation of the trial response. Thus, (b) can be pruned, and subtree 4 is
considered next. By a similar process, (a) is also pruned. Last, the tree with root labeled
5 is examined, and it is determined that the direct answer (no) can also be pruned.
The final result of the traversal is that the direct answer, (a), and (b) are marked as
pruned, and a response consisting of just acts (c) and (d) is returned by the generator.

5.5 Related Work in Generation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997622">
This work differs from most previous work in cooperative response generation in that
the information given in an indirect answer conversationally implicates the direct an-
swer. Hirschberg (1985) implemented a system that determines whether a yes or no
alone licenses any unwanted scalar implicatures, and if so, proposes alternative true
scalar responses that do not. In our model, that type of response is generated by con-
structing a response from an Answer-no or Answer-hedge operator having a single Use-
contrast satellite, motivated by clarify-extent-indicated, as illustrated in Section 5.2.7.58
However, Hirschberg&apos;s model does not account for other types of indirect answers,
which can be constructed using the other operators (or other combinations of the
above operators) in our model, nor for other motives for selecting Use-contrast such
as answer-ref-indicated and appeasement-indicated.
Rhetorical or coherence relations (Grimes 1975; Halliday 1976; Mann and Thomp-
son 1988) have been used in several text-generation systems to aid in ordering parts of
a text (e.g., Hovy 1988) as well as in content planning (e.g., McKeown 1985; Moore and
Paris 1993). The discourse plan operators based on coherence relations in our model

(i.e., the operators used as satellites of top-level operators) play a similar role in con-
tent planning. However, none of the above approaches model the speaker&apos;s motivation
for selecting optional satellites. Stimulus conditions provide principled discourse-level
knowledge (based upon principles of efficiency, accuracy, and politeness) for choice of
an appropriate discourse strategy. Also, stimulus conditions enable content selection
to be sensitive not only to the current discourse context, but also to the anticipated
effect of a part of the planned response. Finally, none of the above systems incorpo-
rate a model of discourse plan recognition into the generation process, which enables
indirect answers to be generated in our model.
Moore and Pollack (1992) show the need to distinguish the intentional and in-
formational structure of discourse, where the latter is characterized by the sort of
relations classified as subject-matter relations in RST. In our model, the operators used
as satellites of top-level answer discourse plan operators are based on relations simi-
lar to RST&apos;s subject-matter relations. The primary goals of these operators are similar
to the effect fields of the corresponding RST relation definitions. However, our model
does distinguish the two types of knowledge. In our model stimulus conditions reflect,
though they do not directly encode, communicative subgoals leading to the adoption
of informational subgoals. For example, the explanation-indicated stimulus condition
may be triggered in situations when the responder&apos;s communicative subgoal would
lead R to select a Use-cause satellite of Answer-yes, rather than a Use-elaboration satellite.
Moore and Paris (1993) argue that it is necessary for generation systems to repre-
sent not only the speaker&apos;s top-level goal, but also the communicative subgoals that
a speaker hoped to achieve by use of an informational relation so that, if that subgoal
is not achieved, then an alternative rhetorical means can be tried. Although stimulus
conditions do reflect the speaker&apos;s motivation for including satellites in a plan, it was
beyond the scope of our work to address the problem of failure to achieve a subgoal
of the original response. Therefore, our system does not record which stimulus condi-
tion motivated a satellite; if the stimulus condition was recorded in the final plan then
our system would have access to information about the speaker&apos;s motivation for the
satellite. In our current approach, if a follow-up question is asked then a response to
the follow-up question is planned independently of the previous response. However,
if R&apos;s beliefs have changed since the original question was asked by Q (e.g., as a result
of information about Q&apos;s beliefs obtained from Q&apos;s follow-up question), then it is pos-
sible in our approach for R&apos;s response to contain different information. Furthermore,
in our approach the original response may provide the information that a questioner
would have to elicit by follow-up questions in a system that can provide only direct
answers.
Finally, our use of interpretation during plan pruning has precursors in previous
work. In Horacek&apos;s ,approach to generating concise explanations (Horacek 1991), a set
of propositions representing the full explanation is pruned by eliminating propositions
that can be derived from the remaining ones by a set of contextual rules. Jameson
and Wahlster (1982) use an anticipation feedback loop algorithm to generate elliptical
utterances.

The performance of the system running on a UNIX workstation depends mainly on
the amount of hypothesis generation performed (which can be controlled by setting a
parameter limiting the depth of the breadth-first search during hypothesis generation).
We have evaluated the system with two experiments. The purpose of the first
experiment was to determine whether users&apos; interpretations of indirect answers would
agree with the system&apos;s interpretations. The purpose of the second experiment was
to see how users would evaluate the unrequested information selected for an indirect
answer by the system. The system was run to verify that it could actually interpret
or generate the responses that were evaluated in the first and second experiments,
respectively. Each experiment was conducted by means of a questionnaire given to
10 adult subjects who were not familiar with this research work. At the beginning
of each questionnaire, subjects were given a brief textual and pictorial description of
the setting in which the questions and responses supposedly had occurred. (A black-
and-white version of the picture shown to subjects for the first experiment is given in
Figure 15. Since the picture used in the experiment was in color, we have annotated
the objects in the figure to indicate their color. A similar picture was used for the
second experiment.) The fictional setting was described as a laboratory inhabited by
a talking robot and a mouse; outside of the laboratory is a manager who cannot see
inside the laboratory, but the robot and manager can communicate with each other.
In both experiments, the questionnaire consisted of questions supposedly posed by
the manager to the robot, and the robot&apos;s possible or actual responses. This setting
was selected because it could easily be presented to subjects with a minimum of
description about the beliefs that might motivate the robot&apos;s responses. Also, a new
domain was used so that our experience with the other domains would not influence
the evaluation.

only 2 items were interpreted by subjects as Other (each by a different subject). In
28% of the instances where the subjects interpreted a response as saying yes or no,
they noted some degree of uncertainty. During debriefing, the subjects who tended
to express uncertainty said that while they might interpret the response as yes or no,
one generally had some uncertainty when the direct answer was omitted. Only one
subject interpreted a bogus question as answering yes or no.
To test the statistical significance of the pattern of responses shown in Table 5, we
took a very conservative approach. We grouped Indirect Interpretation (?) with Other in
Table 5 for question-response instances where the system interpreted the response as
an indirect answer, and we grouped Indirect Interpretation (?) with Indirect Interpretation
for instances where the system did not interpret the response as an indirect answer.
Thus Indirect Interpretation (?) responses by the subjects were treated as disagreeing
with the system&apos;s interpretation of the example. We then applied Cochran&apos;s Q test
(Cochran 1950) to the resulting two columns of data. The result shows that the pattern
of responses is statistically significant (not the result of random chance) at better than
the level p &lt; .005. To determine whether the subjects differentiated between responses
that the system interpreted as indirect answers and those that it did not, we applied
the Mann Whitney U statistic (Siegel 1956), which showed no score overlap at the
level p &lt; .005.

our system used to trigger one of the extended responses to the question. Items 3 and

selected the response motivated by the listed stimulus condition, the number who
selected the direct answer alone or the direct answer with emphasis but no additional

a stimulus condition. Note that none of the subjects selected a response with extra
information for the two bogus questions, indicating that they were not merely inclined
to select responses with extra information.
Items 8 and 10 warrant some discussion. Question 8 was problematic. The origi-
nal question given to the first four subjects asked whether the robot could tell the lab
manager the time. The response &amp;quot;No. There is no clock in here.&amp;quot; was motivated by the
stimulus condition excuse-indicated. However, two of the four subjects selected just No
as the best response, and explained during debriefing that if the robot could tell time,
then certainly he had an internal clock that he could use (since all computers have
internal clocks) and thus the absence of a clock in the room was not relevant. Since
the prior beliefs of these subjects conflicted with the beliefs that were intended as the
context for interpreting the robot&apos;s response, we altered the question for the remainder
of the study to circumvent this problem. In item 10, the extra information in the sys-
tem&apos;s response was motivated by the appeasement-indicated stimulus condition. In that

Since only 4 of the 10 subjects selected this response, it is possible that the subjects

dialogue, despite the fact that it does occur in human-human dialogue. Alternatively,
the subjects did not have enough information to recognize the response as attempted
appeasement.

In summary, we have proposed and implemented a computational model for inter-
preting and generating indirect answers to yes-no questions in English. This paper
describes the knowledge and processes provided by the model. Generation and inter-
pretation are treated, respectively, as construction of and recognition of a responder&apos;s
discourse plan for a full answer. A discourse plan explicitly relates a speaker&apos;s beliefs
and discourse goals to his program of communicative actions. An indirect answer is
the result of the responder providing only part of the planned response, but intending

for his discourse plan to be recognized by the questioner. Discourse plan construction
and recognition make use of the beliefs that are presumed to be shared by the partic-
ipants, as well as shared knowledge of discourse strategies, represented in the model
by shared discourse plan operators. In the operators, coherence relations are used to
characterize types of satellites that may accompany each type of answer. Recognizing
a mutually plausible coherence relation obtaining between the actual response and
a possible direct answer plays an important role in recognizing the responder&apos;s dis-
course plan. The use of hypothesis generation in interpretation broadens the coverage
of the model to cases where more is missing from a full answer than just the nucleus of
a top-level operator. (From the point of view of generation, it enables the construction
of a more concise, though no less informative, response.) Stimulus conditions model a
speaker&apos;s motivation for selecting a satellite. During generation, the speaker uses his
own interpretation capability to determine what parts of the plan are inferable by the
hearer in the current discourse context and thus do not need to be explicitly given.
We argue that because of the role of interpretation in generation, Q&apos;s belief that R
intended for Q to recognize the answer is warranted by Q&apos;s successful recognition of
the plan.
Although it was not our goal to develop a cognitive model of how implicatures are
produced and comprehended, certain aspects of the model might be incorporated into
a cognitive model. To a large extent the model is recognitional rather than inferential. Of
course, we make no claims about the cognitive plausibility of the particular coherence
relations and discourse plan operators used in our model, which were encoded solely
on the basis of their descriptive and computational utility. We await further cognitive
studies on coherence relations as begun in Sanders, Spooren, and Noordman (1992),
Knott and Dale (1994), and Knott (1995). Since the work reported in this paper was
performed, the first author has investigated the automatic compilation of discourse
plan operators in a computational cognitive architecture (SOAR) (Green and Lehman
1998).
In conclusion, our model provides wider coverage than previous computational
models for generating and interpreting answers. Specifically, it covers both direct and
indirect answers, multiple-sentence responses, a variety of types of indirect answer
(i.e., characterized in terms of multiple coherence relations), and multiple types of
speaker motivation for deciding to provide extra information (i.e. characterized in
terms of different stimulus conditions). In addition, it appears that this approach could
be extended to other discourse-expectation-based types of conversational implicature.
As a computational model of conversational implicature, it extends current plan-based
theories of implicature in several ways. First, it demonstrates the role of shared dis-
course expectations and pragmatic knowledge. Second, it makes predictions about
cancelability in terms of intentional structure of discourse. Lastly, it treats generation
as a process drawing upon the speaker&apos;s own interpretation mechanism.

According to one study of spoken English (Stenstrom 1984) (described in Section 2), 13% of responses to certain yes-no questions were indirect answers. Thus, a robust dialogue system should be able to interpret indirect answers. Furthermore, there are good reasons for generating an indirect answer instead of just a yes or no answer. First, an indirect answer may be considered more polite than a direct answer (Brown and Levinson 1978). For example, in (1)i, Q has indicated (by the manner in which Q expressed the question) that Q believes it likely that R will get a car. By avoiding explicit disagreement with this belief, the response in (1)iii would be considered more polite than a direct answer of (1)ii. Second, an indirect answer may be more efficient than a direct answer. For example, even if (1)ii is given, including (1)iii in R&apos;s response contributes to efficiency by forestalling and answering a possible follow-up of well, why not? from Q, which can be anticipated since the form of Q&apos;s question suggests that Q may be </context>
<context position="5563" citStr="Brown and Levinson 1978" startWordPosition="904" endWordPosition="907">ly true. In contrast, a direct answer entails R&apos;s evaluation of the truth of p. The model presupposes that Q and R mutually believe that Q&apos;s question has been understood by R as intended by Q, that Q&apos;s question is appropriate, and that R can provide one of the above answers. Furthermore, it is assumed that Q and R are engaged in a cooperative and polite task-oriented dialogue.&apos; The model is based upon examples of uses of direct and indirect answers found in transcripts of two-person telephone conversations between travel agents and their clients (SRI 1992), examples given in previous studies (Brown and Levinson 1978; Hirschberg 1985; Kiefer 1980; Levinson 1983; Stenstrom 1984) and constructed examples reflecting our judgments. To give an overview of the model, generation and interpretation are treated, respectively, as construction of and recognition of the responder&apos;s discourse plan specification for a full answer. In general, a discourse plan specification (for the sake of brevity, hereafter referred to as discourse plan) explicitly relates a speaker&apos;s beliefs and discourse goals to his program of communicative actions (Pollack 1990). Discourse plan construction and recognition make use of the beliefs </context>
<context position="73962" citStr="Brown and Levinson 1978" startWordPosition="11953" endWordPosition="11956">als would fail. To overcome these problems, we have augmented the satellite discourse plan operators, as described in Section 3, with one or more stimulus conditions. Two examples are shown in Figure 10. Stimulus conditions describe general types of situations in which a speaker is motivated to include a satellite during plan construction. They can be thought of as situational triggers, which give rise to new speaker goals (i.e., the primary goals of the satellite operator), and which are the compiled result of deeper planning based upon principles of cooperativity (Grice 1975) or politeness (Brown and Levinson 1978).&apos; In order for a satellite to be included, all of its applicability conditions and at least one of its stimulus conditions must be true. 40 It was beyond the scope of our research to model recognition of stimulus conditions. We argue in Section 5.3, however, that this does not compromise our approach as a model of conversational implicature. 412 Green and Carberry Indirect Answers Our methodology for identifying stimulus conditions was to survey linguistic studies, described in Section 5.1, as well as to analyze the possible motivation of the speaker in the examples in our corpus. The rules u</context>

However, by use of (24)ii in an appropriate discourse context, R is able to convey explicitly which letter has been received as well as to conversationally implicate that R has not gotten the other letters in question. (24) i. Q: Have you gotten the letters yet? R: I&apos;ve gotten the letter from X. 5.1.4 Politeness. Strenstrom claims that extra information may be given for social reasons. Kiefer notes that extra information may be given as an excuse when the answer indicates that the speaker has failed to fulfill a social obligation. Brown and Levinson (1978) claim that politeness strategies, which may at times conflict with Gricean maxims, account for many uses of language. According to Brown and Levinson, certain communicative acts are intrinsically face-threatening acts (FTAs). That is, doing an FTA is likely to injure some conversational participant&apos;s face, or public self-image. For example, orders and requests threaten the recipient&apos;s negative face, &amp;quot;the want ... that his actions be unimpeded by others&amp;quot; (p. 67). On the other hand, disagreement or bearing &amp;quot;bad news&amp;quot; threatens the speaker&apos;s positive face, the want to be looked upon favorably by</context>

We make no further claims about the formalism itself. 19 There are three other &amp;quot;top-level&amp;quot; operators in the model for expressing the remaining types of full answers illustrated in Table 1. 20 In general, an applicability condition is a condition that must hold for a plan operator to be invoked, but that a planner will not attempt to bring about (Carberry 1990). 397 Computational Linguistics Volume 25, Number 3 (Answer-yes s h ?p): (Answer-no s h ?p) Applicability conditions: Applicability conditions: (discourse-expectation (discourse-expectation (informif s h ?p)) (informif s h ?p) (bel s ?p) (bel s (not ?p)) Nucleus: Nucleus: (inform s h ?p) (inform s h (not ?p)) Satellites: Satellites: (Use-condition s h ?p) (Use-otherwise s h (not ?p)) (Use-elaboration s h ?p) (Use-obstacle s h (not ?p)) (Use-cause s h ?p) (Use-contrast s h (not ?p)) Primary goals: Primary goals: (BMB h s ?p) (BMB h s (not ?p) ) Figure 2 Discourse plan operators for yes and no a</context>

In one experiment, in which subjects responded to the question, Do you accept credit cards?, about half of the subjects provided information answering an indirect request of What credit cards do you accept?

However, following Thomason (1990), a shared belief is merely represented in the conversational record as if it were mutually believed, although each participant need not actually believe it. 6 However, our model does not address the interesting question of under what conditions a direct answer should be given explicitly even when it is inferable from other parts of the response.

This example illustrates a case in which, provided that R had gotten some but not all of the letters in question, just yes would be untruthful and just no would be misleading (since Q might conclude from the latter that R had gotten none of them). We have developed a computational model, implemented in Common LISP, for interpreting and generating indirect answers to yes-no questions in English (Green 1994). By a yes-no question we mean one or more utterances used as a request by Q that R convey R&apos;s evaluation of the truth of a proposition p. Consisting of one or more utterances, an indirect answer is used to convey, yet does not semantically entail, R&apos;s evaluation of the truth of p, i.e., that p is true, that p is false, that p might be true, that p might be false, or that p is partially true. In contrast, a direct answer entails R&apos;s evaluation of the truth of p.

That is, the constraint eliminates interpretations which, in our judgment, are not plausible due to incoherence. For a description of the constraint, see Green (1994).

(If answer recognition were unsuccessful, then the discourse processor would invoke other types of recognizers for other types of responses.) The answer recognizer returns a partially ordered set (possibly empty) of answer discourse plans that it is plausible to ascribe to R as underlying (part or all of) the turn. The final choice of which discourse plan to ascribe to R should be made by the higher-level discourse processor, since it must select an interpretation consistent with the rest of the discourse. 4.3 Comparison to Previous Approaches to Conversational Implicature Grice (1975) has proposed a theory of conversational implicature to account for certain types of conversational inferences. According to Grice, a speaker may convey more than the conventional meaning of an utterance by making use of the hearer&apos;s expectation that the speaker is adhering to general principles of cooperative conversation. Two necessary (but not sufficient) properties of conversational implicatures involve cancelability and speaker intention (Grice 1975; Hirschberg 1985). First, potential conversational implicatures may be canceled explicitly, i.e., disavowed by the speaker in the preceding o</context>

To overcome these problems, we have augmented the satellite discourse plan operators, as described in Section 3, with one or more stimulus conditions. Two examples are shown in Figure 10. Stimulus conditions describe general types of situations in which a speaker is motivated to include a satellite during plan construction. They can be thought of as situational triggers, which give rise to new speaker goals (i.e., the primary goals of the satellite operator), and which are the compiled result of deeper planning based upon principles of cooperativity (Grice 1975) or politeness (Brown and Levinson 1978).&apos; In order for a satellite to be included, all of its applicability conditions and at least one of its stimulus conditions must be true. 40 It was beyond the scope of our research to model recognition of stimulus conditions. We argue in Section 5.3, however, that this does not compromise our approach as a model of conversational implicature. 412 Green and Carberry Indirect Answers Our methodology for identifying stimulus conditions was to survey linguistic studies, described in Section 5.1, as well as to analyze the possible motivation of the speaker in</context>

Two necessary (but not sufficient) properties of conversational implicatures involve cancelability and speaker intention (Grice 1975; Hirschberg 1985). First, potential conversational implicatures may be canceled explicitly, i.e., disavowed by the speaker in the preceding or subsequent discourse context, or even canceled implicitly given a particular set of shared beliefs. In fact, potential implicatures may undergo a change in status from cancelable to noncancelable in the subsequent discourse (Gunji 1981). Second, conversational implicatures are part of the intended meaning of an utterance. Grice proposes several maxims of cooperative conversation that a hearer uses as justification for inferring conversational implicatures. However, Grice&apos;s theory is inadequate as the basis for a computational model of how conversational implicatures are derived.

According to Grice, a speaker may convey more than the conventional meaning of an utterance by making use of the hearer&apos;s expectation that the speaker is adhering to general principles of cooperative conversation. Two necessary (but not sufficient) properties of conversational implicatures involve cancelability and speaker intention (Grice 1975; Hirschberg 1985). First, potential conversational implicatures may be canceled explicitly, i.e., disavowed by the speaker in the preceding or subsequent discourse context, or even canceled implicitly given a particular set of shared beliefs. In fact, potential implicatures may undergo a change in status from cancelable to noncancelable in the subsequent discourse (Gunji 1981). Second, conversational implicatures are part of the intended meaning of an utterance. Grice proposes several maxims of cooperative conversation that a hearer uses as justification for inferring conversational implicatures. However, Gric</context>

For example, unexpected answers to questions, refusals of requests and offers, and admissions of blame are typically marked with features from the above list. 44 She found that 61% of negative direct answers but only 24% of positive direct answers were accompanied by qualify acts. 45 Levinson&apos;s example (55). 414 Green and Carberry Indirect Answers 5.1.3 Avoid Misunderstanding. Stenstrom notes that extra information may be given to qualify an answer. Hirschberg (1985) claims that speakers may give indirect answers to block potential unintended scalar implicatures of a yes or no alone. For example in (2), repeated below as (24), R&apos;s response is preferable to just no, since that would license the incorrect scalar implicature that R had not received any of the letters in question. However, by use of (24)ii in an appropriate discourse context, R is able to convey explicitly which letter has been received as well as to conversationally implicate that R has not gotten the other letters in question.

During interpretation, the same rules are evaluated with respect to the beliefs Q presumes to be shared with R. Thus, during generation R assumes that a coherence relation that is plausible with respect to his shared beliefs would be plausible to Q as well. That is, Q ought to be able to recognize the implicit relation between the nucleus and satellite. However, the generation and interpretation of indirect answers requires additional knowledge. For example, for R&apos;s contribution to be recognized as an answer, there must be a discourse expectation (Levinson 1983; Reichman 1985) of an answer. Also, during interpretation, for a particular answer to be licensed by R, the attribution of R&apos;s intention to convey that answer must be consistent with Q&apos;s beliefs about R&apos;s intentions. For example, a putative implicature that p holds would not be licensed if R provides a disclaimer that it is not R&apos;s intention to convey that p holds. This and other types of knowledge about full answers is represented as discourse plan operators, described in Section 3.2.

In our judgement, normally it would sound more coherent to give (12)v before (12)iv if (12)vi were not included. However, when (12)vi is included, (12)v not only elaborates upon the yes, but also serves as background for (12)vi. Another possible motivation for giving (12)v after (12)iv might be to delay giving dispreferred information (Levinson 1983), e.g., if the speaker believed that a yes was an unexpected or unwanted answer to (12)i. 404 Green and Carberry Indirect Answers Answer-no Answer-yes / [yes] Use-elaboration Use-cause [no] Use-obstacle [iii] Use-cause iv Figure 8 Ranking candidate plans. By these heuristics, a yes answer would be the preferred interpretation, since the candidate Answer-yes plan uses the same number of hypotheses as the candidate Answer-no plan, and accounts for more of R&apos;s response.

Candidates that do not account for any actual parts of the response are eliminated at the end of phase one. Thus the output of phase one of interpretation would be just the two candidates shown in Figure 8. Phase two would evaluate the Answer-yes candidate as more preferred than the Answer-no candidate, since the former interpretation requires the same number of hypotheses and also accounts for more of R&apos;s response. 4.2 Role of the Answer Recognizer in Discourse Processing As discourse researchers have pointed out (e.g., Reichman 1985; Levinson 1983)) the asking of a yes-no question creates the expectation that R will provide the answer 406 Green and Carberry Indirect Answers (directly or indirectly), if possible. Other acceptable, though less preferred, responses include I don&apos;t know and replies that provide other helpful information. Furthermore, an answer need not be given in the turn immediately following the turn in which the question was asked. For example, in (13) the yes-no question in (13)i is not answered until (13)v, separated by a request for clarification in (13)ii and its answer in (13)iii. (13) i.

Clark (1979) studied how different factors may influence the responder&apos;s confidence that the literal meaning of a question was intended and confidence that a particular indirect meaning was intended. In one experiment, in which subjects responded to the question, Do you accept credit cards?, about half of the subjects provided information answering an indirect request of What credit cards do you accept? Clark speculates that the half who included information addressing the indirect request in their response had some, but not necessarily total, confidence that it was intended. According to Levinson (1983), a yes-no question often may be interpreted as a prerequest for another request, i.e., it may be used in the first position of the sequence 41 We are reporting only cases where the extra information may be used as an indirect answer. 42 In this example, Kiefer&apos;s (11b), we follow Kiefer&apos;s use of capitalization to indicate that tomorrow would be stressed in spoken English. 43 Kiefer&apos;s (21b). 413 Computational Linguistics Volume 25, Number 3 T1âT4, where the occurrence of T3 and T4 are conditional upon R&apos;s answer in T2: â¢ Ti: Q makes a prerequest to determine if a precondition of an action to be</context>

Another reason is that, since receiving an offer is preferred to making a request (Schegloff 1979), by making a prerequest, Q gives R the opportunity to offer whatever Q would request in T3, i.e., the sequence would then consist of just Ti and T4. In analyses based on speech act theory, in a sequence consisting of just Ti and T4, the prerequest would be referred to as an indirect speech act. 5.1.2 Explanation for Unexpected Answer. Stenstrom notes that a reason for providing extra information is to provide an explanation justifying a negative answer.&amp;quot; According to Levinson (1983), the presence of an explanation is a distinguishing feature of dispreferred responses to questions and other second parts of adjacency pairs (Schegloff 1972). In an adjacency pair, each member of the pair is produced by a different speaker, and the occurrence of the first part creates the expectation that the second part will appear, although not necessarily immediately following the first member. Levinson claims that dispreferred responses to first parts of adjacency pairs can be identified by structural features such as: â¢ use of pauses or displacement, â¢ prefacing with markers (e.g. uh or </context>

Section 3 describes the reversible knowledge in our model, i.e., knowledge used both in interpretation and generation of indirect answers. Sections 4 and 5 describe the interpretation and generation components, respectively. Section 5 includes a description of additional pragmatic knowledge required for generation. Section 6 provides an evaluation of the work. Finally, the last section discusses future research and provides a summary. 4 This terminology was adopted from Rhetorical Structure Theory (Mann and Thompson 1983, 1988), discussed in Section 2. 5 Our notion of shared belief is similar to the notion of one-sided mutual belief (Clark and Marshall 1981). However, following Thomason (1990), a shared belief is merely represented in the conversational record as if it were mutually believed, although each participant need not actually believe it. 6 However, our model does not address the interesting question of under what conditions a direct answer should be given explicitly even when it is inferable from other parts of the response.

Also, to the right of each of the (c)â(e) sentences is a name intended to suggest the type of relation holding between that sentence and the associated (b) sentence. For example, (1c) provides a condition for the truth of (lb), (1d) elaborates upon (lb), and (le) provides the agent&apos;s motivation for (lb). Many of these relations are similar to the subject-matter relations of Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann and Thompson 1983, 1988), a general theory of discourse coherence. Thus, we refer to these as coherence relations. Other sentences providing the same type of information, i.e., satisfying the same coherence relation, could be substituted for each (c)â(e) sentence without destroying coherence. For example, another plausible condition could be substituted for (lc).

To give a brief overview of Rhetorical Structure Theory as it relates to our model, one of the goals of RST is to provide a set of relations for describing the organization of coherent text. An RST relation is defined as a relation between two text spans, called the nucleus and satellite. The nucleus is the span which is &amp;quot;more essential to the writer&apos;s purpose [than the satellite is],, (Mann and Thompson 1988, 266). A relation definition provides a set of constraints on the nucleus and satellite, and an effect field. According to RST, implicit relational propositions are conveyed in discourse. 10 As noted earlier, this terminology is borrowed from Rhetorical Structure Theory, described below. 11 Constructed examples are used here to provide a concise means of demonstrating the classes of satellites. 12 Specifically, the possible types of direct answers handled in the model are: (lb) that p is true, (2b) that p is false, (3b) that there is some truth to p, (4b) that p may be true, or (5b) that p ma</context>

Rhetorical or coherence relations (Grimes 1975; Halliday 1976; Mann and Thompson 1988) have been used in several text-generation systems to aid in ordering parts of a text (e.g., Hovy 1988) as well as in content planning (e.g., McKeown 1985; Moore and Paris 1993).

Moore and Paris (1993) argue that it is necessary for generation systems to represent not only the speaker&apos;s top-level goal, but also the communicative subgoals that a speaker hoped to achieve by use of an informational relation so that, if that subgoal is not achieved, then an alternative rhetorical means can be tried.

Finally, none of the above systems incorporate a model of discourse plan recognition into the generation process, which enables indirect answers to be generated in our model.

For example, Q also must believe that there is a shared discourse expectation of an answer to a particular question. In other words, in our model, discourse plans provide additional constraints on the beliefs and intentions of the speaker that a hearer uses in interpreting a response. Another limitation of the above approaches is that they provide no explanation for the phenomenon of loss of cancelability described above. Plan recognition has been used to model the interpretation of indirect speech acts (Perrault and Allen 1980; Hinkelman 1989) and ellipsis (Carberry 1990; Litman 1986), discourse phenomena that share with conversational implicature the two necessary conditions described above, cancelablity and speaker intention. However, these models are inadequate for interpreting indirect answers, i.e., for deriving an implicated answer p from an indirect answer q.

During interpretation, the same rules are evaluated with respect to the beliefs Q presumes to be shared with R. Thus, during generation R assumes that a coherence relation that is plausible with respect to his shared beliefs would be plausible to Q as well. That is, Q ought to be able to recognize the implicit relation between the nucleus and satellite. However, the generation and interpretation of indirect answers requires additional knowledge. For example, for R&apos;s contribution to be recognized as an answer, there must be a discourse expectation (Levinson 1983; Reichman 1985) of an answer. Also, during interpretation, for a particular answer to be licensed by R, the attribution of R&apos;s intention to convey that answer must be consistent with Q&apos;s beliefs about R&apos;s intentions. For example, a putative implicature that p holds would not be licensed if R provides a disclaimer that it is not R&apos;s intention to convey that p holds. This and other types of knowledge about full answers is represented as discourse plan operators, described in Section 3.2. In our model, a discourse plan operator captures shared, domain-independent knowledge that is used, along with coherence rul</context>

Candidates that do not account for any actual parts of the response are eliminated at the end of phase one. Thus the output of phase one of interpretation would be just the two candidates shown in Figure 8. Phase two would evaluate the Answer-yes candidate as more preferred than the Answer-no candidate, since the former interpretation requires the same number of hypotheses and also accounts for more of R&apos;s response. 4.2 Role of the Answer Recognizer in Discourse Processing As discourse researchers have pointed out (e.g., Reichman 1985; Levinson 1983)) the asking of a yes-no question creates the expectation that R will provide the answer 406 Green and Carberry Indirect Answers (directly or indirectly), if possible. Other acceptable, though less preferred, responses include I don&apos;t know and replies that provide other helpful information. Furthermore, an answer need not be given in the turn immediately following the turn in which the question was asked.

Levinson claims that prerequests are used to check whether the planned request (in T3) is likely to succeed so that a dispreferred response to it can be avoided by Q. Another reason is that, since receiving an offer is preferred to making a request (Schegloff 1979), by making a prerequest, Q gives R the opportunity to offer whatever Q would request in T3, i.e., the sequence would then consist of just Ti and T4. In analyses based on speech act theory, in a sequence consisting of just Ti and T4, the prerequest would be referred to as an indirect speech act. 5.1.2 Explanation for Unexpected Answer. Stenstrom notes that a reason for providing extra information is to provide an explanation justifying a negative answer.&amp;quot; According to Levinson (1983), the presence of an explanation is a distinguishing feature of dispreferred responses to questions and other se</context>

We then applied Cochran&apos;s Q test (Cochran 1950) to the resulting two columns of data. The result shows that the pattern of responses is statistically significant (not the result of random chance) at better than the level p &lt; .005. To determine whether the subjects differentiated between responses that the system interpreted as indirect answers and those that it did not, we applied the Mann Whitney U statistic (Siegel 1956), which showed no score overlap at the level p &lt; .005. 6.2 Experiment 2 6.2.1 Experiment. Although the linguistic studies discussed in Section 5 show that in human-human dialogue people often include additional unrequested information in their responses to yes-no questions, we conducted a second experiment to determine how users would evaluate responses consisting of the kinds of extra unrequested information produced by our system.

The model presupposes that Q and R mutually believe that Q&apos;s question has been understood by R as intended by Q, that Q&apos;s question is appropriate, and that R can provide one of the above answers. Furthermore, it is assumed that Q and R are engaged in a cooperative and polite task-oriented dialogue.&apos; The model is based upon examples of uses of direct and indirect answers found in transcripts of two-person telephone conversations between travel agents and their clients (SRI 1992), examples given in previous studies (Brown and Levinson 1978; Hirschberg 1985; Kiefer 1980; Levinson 1983; Stenstrom 1984) and constructed examples reflecting our judgments. To give an overview of the model, generation and interpretation are treated, respectively, as construction of and recognition of the responder&apos;s discourse plan specification for a full answer. In general, a discourse plan specification (for the sake of brevity, hereafter referred to as discourse plan) explicitly relates a speaker&apos;s beliefs and discourse goals to his program of communicative actions (Pollack 1990).

Next, we describe informally how coherence relations (similar to subjectmatter relations of Rhetorical Structure Theory [Mann and Thompson 1983, 1988]) are used to characterize the possible types of indirect answers handled in our model. 2.1 Descriptive Study of Questions and Responses Stenstrom (1984) describes characteristics of questions and responses in English, based on her study of a corpus of 25 conversations (face-to-face and telephone). She found that 13% of responses to polar questions (typically expressed as subject-auxilliary inverted questions) were indirect answers, and that 7% of responses to requests for confirmation (expressed as tag-questions and declaratives) were indirect.&apos; Furthermore, she points out the similarity in function of indirect answers to the extra information, referred to as qualify acts in her classification scheme, often accompanying direct answers (Stenst</context>

Second, the plan pruning phase uses the model&apos;s own interpretation capability to determine what information in the full response does not need to be stated explicitly. In appropriate discourse contexts, i.e., in contexts where the direct answer can be inferred by Q from other parts of the full answer, a plan for an indirect answer is thereby generated. When the direct answer must be given explicitly, the result is a plan for a direct answer accompanied by appropriate extra information. (According to the study mentioned in Section 2 [Stenstrom 1984], 85% of direct answers are accompanied by such information. Thus, it is important to model this type of response as well.) While the pragmatic knowledge described in Section 3 is sufficient for interpretation, it is not sufficient for the problem of content planning during generation.

Sections 4 and 5 describe the interpretation and generation components, respectively. Section 5 includes a description of additional pragmatic knowledge required for generation. Section 6 provides an evaluation of the work. Finally, the last section discusses future research and provides a summary. 4 This terminology was adopted from Rhetorical Structure Theory (Mann and Thompson 1983, 1988), discussed in Section 2. 5 Our notion of shared belief is similar to the notion of one-sided mutual belief (Clark and Marshall 1981). However, following Thomason (1990), a shared belief is merely represented in the conversational record as if it were mutually believed, although each participant need not actually believe it. 6 However, our model does not address the interesting question of under what conditions a direct answer should be given explicitly even when it is inferable from other parts of the response.

(18) i. Q: X will be renting a car, won&apos;t he? R: [No.] iii. He can&apos;t drive. In other words, these models lack requisite knowledge encoded in our model in terms of possible satellites (based on coherence relations) of top-level discourse plan operators. Also, the above plan-based models face the same problems as Hirschberg&apos;s since they do not address multiutterance responses. Philosophers (Thomason 1990; McCafferty 1987) have argued for a plan-based theory of implicature as an alternative to Grice&apos;s theory. Thomason proposes that implicatures are comprehended by a process of accommodation of the conversational record to fit the inferred plans of the speaker. According to McCafferty, &amp;quot;implicatures are things that the speaker plans that the hearer believe (and that the hearer can realize that the speaker plans that the hearer believe)&amp;quot; (p. 18). He claims that a theory based upon inferring the speaker&apos;s plan avoids the problem of predicting spurious implicatures, since the spurious implicature </context>
