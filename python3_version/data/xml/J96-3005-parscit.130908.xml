In Situations and Attitudes (Barwise and Perry 1983) Barwise and Perry decide that
meaning should be taken to be a triadic relation not a dyadic one. While there may
be good reasons for deciding to procede on this basis, one of the reasons they give is
definitely a bad one, and this is the principal subject of this note.
On pages 222-23 they remark that if meaning is to be a dyadic relation it is nec-
essary that the complement of a situation should—at least sometimes—be another
situation. In the set theory that is the basis for their development—KPU—it is ele-
mentary that the complement of a set is never a set. This compels the designers of
situation semantics to make meaning a triadic relation as we will now explain.
Barwise and Perry take individuals, properties, relations, and locations as prim-
itives. A situation-type is a partial function from n-ary relations and n individuals to
the set {0,1} (p. 8). In modern situation-semantic parlance, this is often referred to as
an infon, or (more precisely) a basic infon. An event, or course-of-events (coe), is a
function from locations to situation-types. For example, the situation-type correspond-
ing to a (real-world) situation in which a dog named Molly barks would be:
(at /, barks, Molly, 1)
and one related coe might be:
e = { (at /, barks, Molly, 1),
(at /&apos;, shouts at, Mr. Levine, Molly, 1),
(at I&amp;quot;, barks, Molly, 0)1
Consider the predicate SO (seeing option) on coes. In a given event, s, an individ-
ual, a, classifies events according to what s/he sees and knows. That is:
(SO, a, ei, 1) Es if el is compatible with what a sees and knows;
(SO, a, e2, 0) E s if e2 is incompatible with what a sees and knows.
This is a partial classification of events; i.e., some events may be neither SO-yes nor
SO-no.
Further to this:

<listItem confidence="0.493862">

In a given situation, s, an event, e, is a visual option for agent a if
(SO, a, e, 1) Es

</listItem>
<equation confidence="0.63921525">
Similarly, e is a visual alternative for a if it is not the case that
(SO, a, e, 0) E s
Given s as above, let:
Xvo = {e : (SO, a, e,1) E s}
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.44427075">

Also, let:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.862014">
XNVO = le : (SO, a, e,0) E s}
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.971529">
= collection of events that a classifies as not being visual options.
Then:
XvA = collection of visual alternatives for a = XNVO.
(In general, we cannot assume XNVO = XVO.)
An utterance, 0, determines a triple 43. = (d,c,0) composed of a discourse situation,
d, a speaker connection function, c, and the utterance, 0.
Furthermore, our interpretation relation (a function from utterances of the above
form to collections of events) is given as:
interpretation of 0 according to d and c = le : d, crf011e holds).
The speaker connection function, c, (or anchor) grounds the individuals, relations,
and locations mentioned in 0 to actual entities participating in the discourse situation,
d. F]] is thus a binary relation, relating the utterance triple to the described situation,
1141. Note that the discourse situation, d, is the situation in which 0 is uttered and thus
is usually distinct from the described situation, 1141, except in cases of self-reflexive
discourse.
For example, if 0 = FIDO RAN, c(FIDO) [&amp;quot;FIDO&amp;quot; is mentioned] = Fido [&amp;quot;Fido&amp;quot;
is used], and c(RAN) = 1 [a location], then if:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.934821">
(1,ran,Fido, 1) E e
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.995398153846154">
we have e E [(13].
There is a problem with this analysis that leads Barwise and Perry to seek a
representation of mental states and events with which to augment the interpretation
relation. The problem involves a distinction Barwise and Perry make between epis-
temic and non-epistemic perception. Attitudinal reports involving the phrase &amp;quot;see
that&amp;quot; followed by a finite complement involve epistemic perception—that is, they
yield information about the inference an agent has performed after seeing a given coe
or situation (p. 207). The problem comes about when Barwise and Perry attempt to
characterize attitude reports involving &amp;quot;see that&amp;quot; in terms of the relation SO.
On pages 209-11 Barwise and Perry claim:
a sees that 0 &gt; {e: not d,c1kel c xNvo(*)
i.e., those events not in the interpretation of 0 must be classified as SO-no. They give
the following proof, on page 211.

the appropriate location, I.&amp;quot; That is:
a sees that 0 &gt; Xv,i c 1141
and since XvA C FI)Il &lt;=&gt; Fil C XNvo (taking complements), we obtain the result.
This yields the following situational analysis of attitudinal reports involving epis-
temic perception. Given an utterance:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.910760666666667">
a := a SAW THAT 0
in order for a to describe an event, e, we use (*) to obtain that we must have at
/ = c(SAW), for every event, el, either:
ei E Flq
or:
(1,S0,a,e1, 0) E e.
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.967872266666667">
The fact that any SO-no event must be classified as such by the event e (the event
corresponding to the attitude report) means that if we view e as a collection of infons,
we will have:
lel _ IXNvol
and by a result above, IXNvo I &gt; MI
It is Barwise and Perry&apos;s contention (p. 222) that F1311 is a proper class, therefore e
is as well. Consider the utterance:
ai := JOE SAW THAT JACKIE WAS BITING MOLLY.
Barwise and Perry argue that
there is a proper class of events el in which Jackie was not biting
Molly, events that must be classified with SO-no. But then [the event]
e required to classify Joe&apos;s visual state must be a proper class. (p. 222)
Thus such events cannot, for example, be constituents of other situations. In particular,
iterated (or embedded) attitude reports cannot be handled in this framework. A report
such as:
</bodyText>
<note confidence="0.693428">
a2 :--= JOHN SAW THAT JOE SAW THAT JACKIE WAS BITING MOLLY
</note>
<bodyText confidence="0.9976265">
would require that the event, e, classifying Joe&apos;s visual state be a constituent of 0-2&apos;s
interpretation, [[E211. This is because the interpretation relation, d, 4E211e holds: intu-
itively, the putative event corresponding to the situation described in a2 would have
to include e since Joe&apos;s visual state in fact comprises the complement of the outer &amp;quot;see
that&amp;quot; clause. Yet e is a proper class and so we cannot have e E [EA as we require.
This can be rectified by adopting as a set-theoretic basis a set theory in which
the complement of a set is always a set. In this case, the analysis proceeds as before,
saving that the collection 1441 (as above) is now a set. With the collection XNV0 no
longer formally constrained to being a class, arguments of the type rife throughout
(Barwise and Perry 1983) can be lodged to illustrate XNvo&apos;S &amp;quot;set-ness,&amp;quot; as well as that of

the interpretations of utterances such as an. Thus the situational analysis of attitudinal
reports extends to iterated reports such as 0-2 without violation of set membership
dicta.
Whatever reasons caused Barwise and Perry to desire a set theory with ur-elements
should presumably still be respected, so if we can find a consistent set theory with
ur-elements and a universal set, the outlook will be a lot brighter. Fortunately there is
such a system, the Jensen-Quine system of set theory known as NFU. For more on this
see Holmes (1994, 1996). Of course, an easy consequence of an axiom of complemen-
tation such as we have in NFU is the negation of the axiom of foundation. Barwise
has elsewhere (1984) argued that we should not regard the axiom of foundation as
essential.
