Gary Hendrix, Chairman, reported for the Program
Committee (which consisted of himself, Charles Fill-
more, Jane Robinson, Ivan Sag, Henry Thompson, and
Robert Wilensky. Twenty-four papers were accepted
out of the sixty-nine submitted, although two of the
papers accepted were not presented because the au-
thor was not able to be present. Hendrix regretted
that time limits and the necessity for balancing the
program prevented accepting more papers. For the
second year in a row, a proceedings for the meeting
has been prepared; copies were distributed at registra-
tion. Fifteen of the papers are printed in full; ab-
stracts are included for the rest; in addition, state-
ments of varying lengths were prepared by most of the
people participating in the panel sessions. [Details of
the program are provided in the April-June 1980 issue
of the AJCL, Volume 6, Number 2, pages 116-117.
Some copies of Proceedings at $5 (add $1 for US first
class mailing and $2 for overseas airprinted delivery)
are still available and can be ordered from the
Secretary-Treasurer.]

Kathy McKeown reported that 164 people had
preregistered for the conference. She described plans
for the banquet to be held in the Chinese Rotunda and
Upper Egyptian Gallery of the University of Pennsyl-
vania Museum; catering is provided by one of the
downtown restaurants. [The final figures for attend-
ance are: 187 total, including 50 students; 43 new
members were added to ACL; 125 people attended

Don Walker reviewed the financial status of the
Association for 1979 and the period of 1980 through
5-31. The income figures for the two periods are
$23,172.55 and $5,083.60, respectively; the corre-
sponding expenses are $13,197.81 and $6,877.84; and
the balances are $9,974.74 and ($1,794.24). The
relatively low income and the deficit for the current
year represent the decision to waive dues for 1980 to
those who were members for 1979 in view of the fact
that the AJCL was not published during the year. He
noted that ACL had received $1,550 from AFIPS this
year and that ACL had provided support for COLING
80 in the amount of $660 plus other mailing costs.
The current assets (as of 5-31-80) of $24,651.89 show
that the organization is still in good financial shape,
although it is explicitly recognized that the expenses
associated with journal production represent only one
of the three issues scheduled for the year. A more
detailed report on financial status is included as an
attachment to these Minutes (on page 192). In re-
sponse to a question about how the money was invest-
ed, Walker reported that most of it was in a money-
market account earning about 12 percent, with the
balance in a short term corporate income fund at 16
percent. He added that the necessity to reinvest these
funds soon at lower interest rates would reduce the
earnings from investments in the near future.
Walker presented the membership status for 1977
and 1978, and for 1980 through 6-12, combining 1979
with 1980 because these figures are merged in view of
the dues situation. For those three periods, the values
for individual members were 500, 444, and 578; for
institutional members, they were 201, 218, and 231;
with total membership figures of 701, 662, and 809.
Membership is clearly on the increase, and with the
new AJCL out, prospects look particularly good. A
more detailed report on membership status is included
as an attachment to these Minutes (on page 192).

George Heidorn reported that two issues of the
American Journal of Computational Linguistics for
1980 have been printed, the second one having just
been mailed. The second issue is similar to the first,
containing three articles and three book reviews, but
no additional material is included in the microfiche.
Fifteen articles are in the review process, and there are
15 more conference papers that are being considered.
In addition, twenty books are out for review. Heidorn
acknowledged that his correspondence with authors
has not been good and pledged to provide better re-
sponse in the future. He announced that Michael
McCord of the University of Kentucky had been ap-
pointed Associate Editor, remarking that his assistance
should improve the overall effectiveness of the opera-
tion. Other editorial support may be added in the
future. More manuscripts are solicited, as are an-
nouncements; in addition, comments on papers will be
published as letters to the editor.

Webber reported on the discussions at the Execu-
tive Committee meeting which took place on 18 June.
Planning for the next meeting is still in progress.
Discussions have been held with the Linguistic Society
of America with regard to holding it in conjunction
with their Annual Meeting in New York, 28-30 De-
cember 1981, at the new Hyatt Hotel. It was also
proposed that we arrange panels and paper sessions at
the AFIPS National Computer and Office Automation
Conferences and perhaps at the West Coast Computer
Fair. Members expressed concern about the timing,
both in relation to the holiday period and to the 18
month hiatus; a recommendation was made to consider
the possibility of holding it in conjunction with the
Summer LSA Institute, which will be at Yale. Associ-
ating it with the Cognitive Science Society seems inap-
propriate on two grounds: the timing (Berkeley, in
August just before the Vancouver IJCAI meeting);
and the feeling that it would not be desirable to have
the ACL so closely coupled with the CSS for the third
year in a row.
Webber described her participation in a meeting of
cognitive, behavioral, and psychological societies on 1
June 1980. . The purpose was to discuss forming a
Federation that would provide better representation to
federal funding agencies and Congress for this class of
interests. There was representation from 14 societies,
including the American Educational Research Associa-
tion, the Society for Neurosciences, the Cognitive
Science Society, and the American Association for
Artificial Intelligence, with memberships ranging from
14,000 to 350. Dues would be set initially at $1 per
society member. In reviewing the proposal, the Exec-
utive Committee felt that the ACL did not need this
kind of Washington presence at the moment - beyond
what was provided by AFIPS - and that the group
assembled did not really constitute a natural class for
ACL. It was reported from the audience that the CSS
membership had voted 3:1 to support participation.
With regard to AFIPS, Webber noted that ACL has
been given two additional years to reach a goal of
1500 members. Whether we reach that number or
not, the activities for additional membership are
worthwhile.
Sondheimer described the plans for the membership
drive. It will include preparation of brochures, gather-
ing mailing lists from various sources, trading adver-
tisements in various journals, staffing booths in vari-
ous professional society meetings, and participating in
other meetings on panels and in other ways that would
increase awareness of the ACL.
The Executive Committee decision to invite the
International Committee on Computational Linguistics
to hold one of the next COLING conferences in the
United States was approved unanimously by the mem-
bers present.

Norm Sondheimer submitted the following:
Whereas the ACL&apos;s problem context is to nurture
computational linguistics, whereas the ACL&apos;s medium
is the annual meeting and journal, whereas the ACL&apos;s
social context is to depend entirely on volunteer labor,
whereas the ACL&apos;s current state and future prospects
are rosy, I move to thank Gary Hendrix and his pro-
gram committee of Charles Fillmore, Jane Robinson,
Ivan Sag, Henry Thompson, and Robert Wilensky for
braving to choose among so many fine papers and
putting together this excellent program, the authors for
proving them right, Bonnie Webber and her committee
of Barbara Grosz and Jerry Hobbs for organizing the
Parasession, Kathy McKeown and her local arrange-
ments committee of Kathy Filliben, Gitaram Lanka,
Interjeet Mani, Eric Mays, Emily Nagle, and Tom
Williams for ensuring that none of us lacked food,
shelter, and/or parking permits, ONR for financially
supporting the Parasession, SRI International for pro-
ducing the Call-for-Papers and the Advance Program,
Sperry Univac for producing the Proceedings, Aravind
Joshi and the Univ. of Penn. Comp. and Info. Sci.
Dept. for contributing the Chinese Rotunda and Upper
Egyptian Gallery as banquet venue and for keeping
our meeting room air-conditioned, George Heidorn for
bringing the hard-copy AJCL into existence, his Edito-
rial Board and contributors for making it something of
which to be proud, and last, but not least, Don Walker
without whose hard work the ACL would certainly
cease to exist.
The members expressed their approval, and the meet-
ing was adjourned.
