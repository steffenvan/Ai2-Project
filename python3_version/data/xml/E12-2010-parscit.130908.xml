This paper presents the first demonstration
of a statistical spoken dialogue system that
uses automatic belief compression to rea-
son over complex user goal sets. Reasoning
over the power set of possible user goals al-
lows complex sets of user goals to be rep-
resented, which leads to more natural dia-
logues. The use of the power set results in a
massive expansion in the number of belief
states maintained by the Partially Observ-
able Markov Decision Process (POMDP)
spoken dialogue manager. A modified form
of Value Directed Compression (VDC) is
applied to the POMDP belief states produc-
ing a near-lossless compression which re-
duces the number of bases required to rep-

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999976297297297">
One of the main problems for a spoken dialogue
system (SDS) is to determine the user’s goal (e.g.
plan suitable meeting times or find a good Indian
restaurant nearby) under uncertainty, and thereby
to compute the optimal next system dialogue ac-
tion (e.g. offer a restaurant, ask for clarification).
Recent research in statistical SDSs has success-
fully addressed aspects of these problems through
the application of Partially Observable Markov
Decision Process (POMDP) approaches (Thom-
son and Young, 2010; Young et al., 2010). How-
ever POMDP SDSs are currently limited by the
representation of user goals adopted to make sys-
tems computationally tractable.
Work in dialogue system evaluation, e.g.
Walker et al. (2004) and Lemon et al. (2006),
shows that real user goals are generally sets of
items, rather than a single item. People like to
explore possible trade offs between the attributes
of items.
Crook and Lemon (2010) identified this as a
central challenge for the field of spoken dialogue
systems, proposing the use of automatic compres-
sion techniques to allow for extended accurate
representations of user goals. This paper presents
a proof of concept of these ideas in the form of a
complete, working spoken dialogue system. The
POMDP dialogue manager (DM) of this demon-
stration system uses a compressed belief space
that was generated using a modified version of the
Value Directed Compression (VDC) algorithm
as originally proposed by Poupart (2005). This
demonstration system extends work presented by
Crook and Lemon (2011) in that it embeds the
compressed complex user goal belief space into a
working system and demonstrates planning (and
acting) in the compressed space.

The type of SDS task that we focus on is a limited-
domain query-dialogue, also known as a “slot fill-
ing” task. The spoken dialogue system has knowl-
edge about some set of objects where these ob-
jects have attributes and these attributes can take
several values. An object can thus be described
by a conjunction of attribute-value pairs. A di-
alogue progresses with the system obtaining re-
quirements from the user which are specified in
terms of attribute values. The system should even-
tually present objects (search results) based upon
its understanding of the user’s requirement. The
dialogue ends when the user accepts one of the
domain objects.
Prior work on POMDP SDSs has assumed that
a user has a narrowly constrained goal (as speci-

fied in terms of the domain objects) and thus the
role of the DM is one of reducing uncertainty un-
til its belief is strongly focused on a particular do-
main object. This has the unfortunate effect of
forcing users to select one domain object in order
to progress the dialogue, see Table 1. Note that the
example given is problematic not only because the
user wants two different food types but because
they have different requirements associated with
each, i.e. Thai restaurants should be in the centre
and cheap, while any French restaurants should be
expensive1 and can be located anywhere. To our
knowledge such a combination of goals with dif-
ferent attribute values cannot be straightforwardly
handled by comparable state-of-the-art statistical
SDSs which appear in the literature.
Crook and Lemon (2011) suggest that rather
than the DM assuming that the user has a single
narrowly constrained goal in mind, it should as-
sume that they want any possible sub-set of the
complete set of domain objects. Thus, instead
of maintaining the POMDP belief over individual
domain objects, it should be maintained over the
power set of domain objects. As an example see
Table 3 which is the power set for a domain with
three objects that can take two attributes u, v with
associated values u1, u2, u3 and v1 respectively.
The power set representation allows the
demonstration system to straightforwardly handle
previously problematic dialogues. See Table 2.
Of course this approach significantly expands the

2.1 Automatic Compression
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999952285714286">
Even considering limited domains, POMDP state
spaces for SDSs grow very quickly. Thus the cur-
rent state-of-the-art in POMDP SDSs uses a vari-
ety of handcrafted compression techniques, such
as making several types of independence assump-
tion as discussed above.
Crook and Lemon (2010) propose replacing
handcrafted compressions with automatic com-
pression techniques. The idea is to use princi-
pled statistical methods for automatically reduc-
ing the dimensionality of belief spaces, but which
preserve useful distributions from the full space,
and thus can more accurately represent real user’s
goals.

<bodyText confidence="0.998955076923077">
The VDC algorithm (Poupart, 2005) uses Krylov
iteration to compute a reduced state space. It finds
a set of linear basis vectors that can reproduce the
value2 of being in any of the original POMDP
states. Where, if a lossless VDC compression is
possible, the number of basis vectors is less than
the original number of POMDP states.
The intuition here is that if the value of taking
an action in a given state has been preserved then
planning is equally as reliable in the compressed
space as the in full space.
The VDC algorithm requires a fully specified
POMDP, i.e. (5, A, O, T, Q, R) where 5 is the set

of states, A is the set of actions, O is the set of ob-
servations, T conditional transition probabilities,
Q conditional observation probabilities, and R is
the reward function. Since it iteratively projects
the rewards associated with each state and action
using the state transition and observation proba-
bilities, the compression found is dependent on
structures and regularities in the POMDP model.
The set of basis vectors found can be used to
project the POMDP reward, transition, and obser-
vation probabilities into the reduced state space
allowing the policy to be learnt and executed in
this state space.
Although the VDC algorithm (Poupart, 2005)
produces compressions that are lossless in terms
of the states’ values, the set of basis vectors found
(when viewed as a transformation matrix) can be
ill-conditioned. This results in numerical instabil-
ity and errors in the belief estimation. The com-
pression used in this demonstration was produced
using a modified VDC algorithm that improves
the matrix condition by approximately selecting
the most independent basis vectors, thus improv-
ing numerical stability. It achieves near-lossless
state value compression while allowing belief es-
timation errors to be minimised and traded-off
against the amount of compression. Details of this
algorithm are to appear in a forthcoming publica-
tion.

<bodyText confidence="0.999842">
Input and output to the demonstration system is
using standard open source and commercial com-
ponents. FreeSWITCH (Minessale II, 2012) pro-
vides a platform for accepting incoming Voice
over IP calls, routing them (using the Media Re-
source Control Protocol (MRCP)) to a Nuance 9.0
Automatic Speech Recogniser (Nuance, 2012).
Output is similarly handled by FreeSWITCH
routing system responses via a CereProc Text-to-
Speech MRCP server (CereProc, 2012) in order
to respond to the user.
The heart of the demonstration system consists
of a State-Estimator server which estimates the
current dialogue state using the compressed state
space previously produced by VDC, a Policy-
Executor server that selects actions based on
the compressed estimated state, and a template
based Natural Language Generator server. These
servers, along with FreeSWITCH, use ZeroC’s
Internet Communications Engine (Ice) middle-
ware (ZeroC, 2012) as a common communica-
tions platform.

The demonstration system provides a restaurant
finder system for the city of Edinburgh (Scot-

results are based on the attributes specified by

The demonstration SDS is typically accessed over
the phone network. For debugging and demon-
stration purposes it is possible to visualise the
belief distribution maintained by the DM as dia-
logues progress. The compressed version of the
belief distribution is not a conventional proba-
bility distribution3 and its visualisation is unin-
formative. Instead we take advantage of the re-
versibility of the VDC compression and project
the distribution back onto the full state space. For
an example of the evolution of the belief distribu-
tion during a dialogue see Figure 1.

4 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99997704">
We present a demonstration of a statistical SDS
that uses automatic belief compression to reason
over complex user goal sets. Using the power set
of domain objects as the states of the POMDP
DM allows complex sets of user goals to be rep-
resented, which leads to more natural dialogues.
To address the massive expansion in the number
of belief states, a modified form of VDC is used
to generate a compression. It is this compressed
space which is used by the DM for planning and
acting in response to user utterances. This is the
first demonstration of a statistical SDS that uses
automatic belief compression to reason over com-
plex user goal sets.
VDC and other automated compression tech-
niques reduce the human design load by automat-
ing part of the current POMDP SDS design pro-
cess. This reduces the knowledge required when
building such statistical systems and should make
them easier for industry to deploy.
Such compression approaches are not only ap-
plicable to SDSs but should be equally relevant
for multi-modal interaction systems where sev-
eral modalities are being combined in user-goal
or state estimation.

5 Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999668772727273">
The current demonstration system is a proof
of concept and is limited to a small number
of attributes and attribute-values. Part of our
ongoing work involves investigation of scaling.
For example, increasing the number of attribute-
values should produce more regularities across
the POMDP space. Does VDC successfully ex-
ploit these?
We are in the process of collecting corpora
for the Edinburgh restaurant domain mentioned
above with the aim that the POMDP observation
and transition statistics can be derived from data.
As part of this work we have launched a long
term, public facing outlet for testing and data col-
lection, see http:\\www.edinburghinfo.
co.uk. It is planned to make future versions of
the demonstration system discussed in this paper
available via this public outlet.
Finally we are investigating the applicability
of other automatic belief (and state) compression
techniques for SDSs, e.g. E-PCA (Roy and Gor-
don, 2002).

Recent research in statistical SDSs has successfully addressed aspects of these problems through the application of Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) approaches (Thomson and Young, 2010; Young et al., 2010). However POMDP SDSs are currently limited by the representation of user goals adopted to make systems computationally tractable. Work in dialogue system evaluation, e.g. Walker et al.

Details of this algorithm are to appear in a forthcoming publication. 3 System Description 3.1 Components Input and output to the demonstration system is using standard open source and commercial components. FreeSWITCH (Minessale II, 2012) provides a platform for accepting incoming Voice over IP calls, routing them (using the Media Resource Control Protocol (MRCP)) to a Nuance 9.0 Automatic Speech Recogniser (Nuance, 2012). Output is similarly handled by FreeSWITCH routing system responses via a CereProc Text-toSpeech MRCP server (CereProc, 2012) in order to respond to the user. The heart of the demonstration system consists of a State-Estimator server which estimates the current dialogue state using the compressed state space previously produced by VDC, a PolicyExecutor server that selects actions based on the compressed estimated state, and a template based Natural Language Generator server. These servers, along with FreeSWITCH, use ZeroC’s Internet Communications Engine (Ice) middleware (ZeroC, 2012) as a co</context>

Crook and Lemon (2010) identified this as a central challenge for the field of spoken dialogue systems, proposing the use of automatic compression techniques to allow for extended accurate representations of user goals. This paper presents a proof of concept of these ideas in the form of a complete, working spoken dialogue system. The POMDP dialogue manager (DM) of this demonstration system uses a compressed belief space that was generated using a modified version of the Value Directed Compression (VDC) algorithm as originally proposed by Poupart (2005). This demonstration system extends work presented by Crook and Lemon (2011) in that it embeds the compressed complex user goal belief space into a working system and demonstrates planning (and acting) in the compressed space. 2 Complex User Goals The type of SDS task that we focus on is a limiteddomain query-dialogue, also known as a “slot filling” task. The spoken dialogue system has knowledge about some set of objects where these objects have attributes and these attributes can take several values. An object can thus be described by a conjunction of attribute-value pairs. A dialogue progres</context>

Thus the current state-of-the-art in POMDP SDSs uses a variety of handcrafted compression techniques, such as making several types of independence assumption as discussed above. Crook and Lemon (2010) propose replacing handcrafted compressions with automatic compression techniques. The idea is to use principled statistical methods for automatically reducing the dimensionality of belief spaces, but which preserve useful distributions from the full space, and thus can more accurately represent real user’s goals. 2.2 VDC Algorithm The VDC algorithm (Poupart, 2005) uses Krylov iteration to compute a reduced state space. It finds a set of linear basis vectors that can reproduce the value2 of being in any of the original POMDP states. Where, if a lossless VDC compression is possible, the number of basis vectors is less than the original number of POMDP states. The intuition here is that if the value of taking an action in a given state has been preserved then planning is equally as reliable in the compressed space as the in full space. The VDC algorithm requires a fully specified POMDP, i.e. (5, A, O, T, Q, R) where 5 is the set 2The sum of discounted fut</context>

Since it iteratively projects the rewards associated with each state and action using the state transition and observation probabilities, the compression found is dependent on structures and regularities in the POMDP model. The set of basis vectors found can be used to project the POMDP reward, transition, and observation probabilities into the reduced state space allowing the policy to be learnt and executed in this state space. Although the VDC algorithm (Poupart, 2005) produces compressions that are lossless in terms of the states’ values, the set of basis vectors found (when viewed as a transformation matrix) can be ill-conditioned. This results in numerical instability and errors in the belief estimation. The compression used in this demonstration was produced using a modified VDC algorithm that improves the matrix condition by approximately selecting the most independent basis vectors, thus improving numerical stability. It achieves near-lossless state value compression while allowing belief estimation errors to be minimised and traded-off against the am</context>

Recent research in statistical SDSs has successfully addressed aspects of these problems through the application of Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) approaches (Thomson and Young, 2010; Young et al., 2010).
