We present an interactive translation
method to support non-professional users
to write an original document. The
method, combining dictionary lookup func-
tion and user-guided stepwise interactive
machine translation, allows the user to ob-
tain clear result with an easy operation.
We implemented the method as an English
writing support facility that serves as a
translation support front-end to an arbi-
trary application.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999979764705883">
With the steady decrease of network communica-
tion cost and equipment prices, world-wide com-
puter networks and the number of its users are
growing very rapidly. However, there is a large
obstacle against global communication over net-
works, namely the language barrier, especially for
non English-speaking people. This is a major reason
personal EJ (English to Japanese) machine transla-
tion systems are gaining popularity in Japan. They
help the user to quickly grasp the content of web
pages, by providing rough translation. Since speed
and lexical coverage are most important require-
ments, conventional automatic machine translation
systems developed so far are useful for this purpose.
Contrary to the EJ direction, the major task in JE
(Japanese to English) direction will be writing short
original documents, such as e-mail. The most impor-
tant requirement will be translation quality, because
the reader is usually different from the MT user.
To control quality, some kind of human interaction
will be inevitable. However, interactive support for
conventional MT systems doesn&apos;t seem suitable for
these users, since they are primarily intended for
professional translators. Their post-editing function
often requires working in a special environment that
requires special training. An interactive, easy-to-
use translation support facility, targeted for non-
professional translators, is desirable.
We may expect that these users have basic knowl-
edge and ability to read and understand English.
This expectation is natural and realistic in a coun-
try like Japan, where all high-school graduates are
supposed to have completed six year course in En-
glish. Their reading skill and grammar knowledge is
usually enough to judge the quality of current MT
systems, but they may need help from MT systems
when browsing the Internet. For the JE direction,
they will not be satisfied with the raw output of con-
ventional MT systems, but it will be too laborious
to write down English sentence from scratch. For
these users, online dictionaries have been used be-
cause of the reliability of the result. However, in
spite of abundant information within the dictionary
such as inflection, verbal case frame, idioms and so
on, the only electronically available part is spelling
of translation equivalents (through copy &amp; paste).
Other information is only presented to be read as in
the case of a paper dictionary, with all further work
left to the user.
In this article, we present an interactive trans-
lation method and its implementation, which has
advantages of both a dictionary look-up tool and a
machine translation system. The system has an in-
teractive interface similar to Kana-Kanji conversion
method, and initially serves as a dictionary look-
up tool. After dictionary lookup, the user can in-
voke syntactic transformation in terms of grammat-
ical information in the dictionary. Syntactic trans-
formation proceeds step by step in a bottom-up
manner, combining smaller translation components
into larger ones. This &amp;quot;dictionary-based interactive
translation&amp;quot; approach allows the user to fully utilize
syntactic information in the dictionary while main-
taining clarity of the result.
In the next section, we give a simple example of
translation steps and provide a general idea of the
method. In section 3, we describe the basic model
and associated operations. Section 4 gives further

explanation about disambiguation capability of the
interactive operations. Section 5 discusses exten-
sions to the basic model to treat linguistic phenom-
ena such as idiomatic expressions. Section 6 de-
scribes the current implementation as a front-end to
an arbitrary application. In section 7, the method is
compared with former approaches. The final section
is the conclusion.

2 An Example
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999966744186046">
In this section we show the basic steps of simple
sentence translation, in order to give a general idea
about how the method works.
Consider a situation where the user is writing a
message in English, using an editor of a mail pro-
gram. Our system is running as a daemon. While
the user is typing English characters, the system
does nothing special and let them through to the
editor window. The system wakes up when the user
toggles on Japanese input. The moment the first
Japanese character is typed in, the main translation
window is opened, and all subsequent characters are
typed in to that window instead of the editor win-
dow.
Suppose the input sentence is one shown in fig-
ure 1 (a). As soon as (a) is entered, the dictionary
look-up function is invoked automatically. A mor-
phological analyzer recognizes word boundaries in
the sentence, looks up corresponding word entries in
the system dictionary, and shows the result in the
main window (b).1 Content words are replaced by a
translation equivalent assumed most plausible, while
functional words are left unchanged.
This representation step, in which English words
(content words) and Japanese words (functional
words) are mixed, separates steps for word trans-
lation â€¢ and later syntactic transformation, making
translation steps clearer. Since word order and func-
tional words carrying grammatical functions are un-
changed, the user can easily recognize the skeleton of
the sentence, and clearly grasp the correspondence
between the original word and its translation equiv-
alent. This representation is not only to show the re-
sults of dictionary look-up like (Canisius, 1977), but
also carries all interactive operations of the method
with it, and has a double role of showing information
and being objects of interactive manipulation.
Translation equivalent alternatives for the cursor
position word (focus word) are displayed in an alter-
natives window, appearing nearby that word. Fig-
ure 2 is a snapshot of the alternatives window for
ronbun (paper). The second line is highlighted to
show that it is the current selection. The user can

change the selection simply by a cursor movement or
mouse click on this window, then the corresponding
translation equivalent on the main window changes
synchronously. To see alternatives for another word,
the user has only to move the cursor to that word on
the main window. There is also a CD-ROM dictio-
nary access function, making translation equivalent
selection easier. In addition, the user can change an
inflection in a similar manner on an inflection selec-
tion window, opened by the user&apos;s request.
If the user needs only the result of dictionary
lookup, s/he can signal the end of translation at this
point, just after choosing the translation equivalent.
If a translation is necessary, the user needs to go one
more step. At the same time as initial translation
equivalent selection, the system predicts an appro-
priate area for translation, as shown by an underline
(b). Just as the translation equivalent selection can
be freely changed, the area can be changed by drag-
ging the left or right edge of the underline. After
the user confirms selections of translation equiva-
lents and translation area on (b), the user invokes
translation. The system performs syntactic trans-
formation using syntactic information in the dictio-
nary such as the verbal case frame of the main verb
in the area, shows the result on the main window,
and replaces the original sentence with the result
(c). When there is more than one possible transla-
tion, the different possibilities are shown in an al-
ternatives window similar to figure 2, allowing the
user to change the choice. When the user triggers
translation end, the result is sent to the original ed-
itor window. The user can continue to work in the
editor after turning off Japanese input.

Most important characteristics of this interactive
translation method is that the Japanese input is con-
verted to English in several steps allowing user inter-
action at each step. In intermediate steps, a mixture

of target language expression and source language
expression are shown to give the current status of the
interactive translation. Translation proceeds from a
smaller unit as word to a larger unit as sentence, step
by step in a bottom-up manner. The result can be
checked and corrected at each step, making it easier
to obtain a desired result. Interactive operations are
similar to those of Kana-Kanji conversion, although
they are further extended to be capable of control-
ling syntactic transformations. We first describe the
basic model that determines the scope and timing of
interaction, then the set of interactive operations.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997058">
3.1 Basic Model
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999932121951219">
The basic model of our method is the syntax-
directed translation scheme with bottom-up at-
tribute evaluation (see chapter 5 of (Aho et al.,
1986)). In this scheme, an attribute of a syntax tree
node is calculated from that of the children nodes
by a semantic rule, associated with the syntax rule
used to build the node from children. Attributes
represent partial translation result for the structure
below the node, and attribute calculation proceeds
from the lexical nodes to the root node in a bottom-
up manner.
Interactivity is integrated with this model by al-
lowing interactive operation when attribute is cal-
culated at each node. Before each calculation, the
system pauses to show an interpretation of the un-
derlying structure, and allows the user to examine
and change it if necessary. When interaction is fin-
ished, the system chooses a next node and pauses
there. This process repeats until the system reaches
the root node. Any translation method can be used
as long as it is compatible with this general scheme.
Although basic model is as described, it is appar-
ently too bothersome to give an operation at every
node. In addition, some nodes only have a formal
role in the grammar, and are not meaningful to the
user. For this reason, the nodes at which the system
automatically pauses for interaction are restricted to
the node marked as a sentence, and the node that
dominates a relative clause and its antecedent: in
short, just restricted to contain one predicate. We
remark that this restriction is effective only on de-
fault decision of which node to pause at, and does
not restrict operations by the user. The system looks
for a minimal node marked as above, then pauses for
user operation. At this time, attributes of the focus
node and lower nodes are still undetermined except
for lexical nodes. When the user triggers translation,
undetermined attributes are calculated, then the re-
sult replaces the tree under the focus node. That
node serves as a kind of lexical node in subsequent
translation.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997875">
3.2 Interactive Operations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999496545454545">
The basic interaction model of the method is that
the system shows current interpretation in the form
of translation equivalents and translation area, while
the user responds to it by changing these initial se-
lections. This set of operations is essentially the
same as the Kana-Kanji conversion method, and its
obvious advantage is that everybody who can use
Kana-Kanji conversion is expected to be well accus-
tomed to these operations.
When the system pauses for interaction, it shows
initial selection of translation equivalents and trans-
lation area, as in figure 1 (b). Translation equivalent
selection for all content words, and the designated
region to be translated next, is shown in a compact
manner, allowing the user to examine and change
them before translation. This mixed representation
level of the source and target language expression
serves as a playground for all subsequent interac-
tions.
After confirming all selections, the user triggers
translation. Then the original area is replaced with
resulting English expression. If there are more than
one possible translation, the system presents them
in a similar window as alternatives window as in fig-
ure 2, and the user is allowed to change the system&apos;s
selection by the same interface as translation equiv-
alent selection.
Translation equivalent selection enables the user
to directly manipulate target language expression.
Selecting before translation is much easier than after
translation, because the word order and understood
syntactic structure is that of the user&apos;s native lan-
guage. The meaning of translation area selection is
also clear. The user should choose the area so that
it contains necessary and sufficient words to be one
meaningful expression. Technically, it is bracketing
by the user. If the user changes the area, the system
changes the analysis according to the new constraint.
Further disambiguation capability of this operation
will be discussed in section 4.
Other possible interactive operations include edit-
ing and undoing the translation. The user can freely
modify the displayed characters at any time, and the
system responds by invoking an appropriate proce-
dure, such as morphological analysis. Also, the user
can go back to any former steps by canceling former
translations.
All these operations are optional, except for trans-
lation triggers to invoke next translation. The
amount of interaction and timing of translation trig-
ger is completely up to the user, and s/he can even
proceed without any modification to the system&apos;s
initial choice.
Steps of interactive translation can be summarized
as below.

3.3.1 A Relative Clause
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999964179487179">
Figure 3 shows translation steps for a sentence
with a relative clause. This sentence has a depen-
dency ambiguity, so we also show how to resolve
it through interaction. The original sentence (a)
contains a relative clause with verb kau (buy) with
an antecedent hon (book). Since Japanese is head-
final, the sentence-initial case element kare-ga (he-
SUBJ) can be the subject of either kau (buy) or
yomu (read), causing syntactic ambiguity.
First, let&apos;s suppose kare-ga is assumed to be the
subject of the relative clause by the system. Then
the system pauses showing (b), as soon as (a) is in-
put. In (b), the translation region is assumed to
be &amp;quot;he-ga buy-ta book&amp;quot;. After translation trigger,
the system pauses showing (c). Please note that
the underlined part in (b) is replaced by its equiva-
lent English expression &amp;quot;the book he bought&amp;quot;, and
the whole sentence is underlined now. After another
translation trigger, (d) is obtained, with missing sub-
ject filled by some default word.
Suppose after obtaining (d) the user noticed that
this interpretation is not what s/he wants, and the
case element kare-ga should be the subject of the
verb of the matrix sentence. Then the user triggers
undo of translation twice, returning to (b). Then
s/he notice that &amp;quot;he -ga buy -ta book&amp;quot; is treated
as one phrase, against his/her interpretation. Then
s/he changes the underlined area to &amp;quot;buy -ta book&amp;quot;,
excluding &amp;quot;he -ga&amp;quot; from the region (e), because this
is the &amp;quot;correct meaningful phrase&amp;quot; in the user&apos;s in-
terpretation. After translation trigger, (f) follows.
Note that the subject of the relative clause is supple-
mented by a default element. Then (g), the desired
result, follows.
Generally, if two syntax tree nodes share a child
leaf node, one is an ancestor of the other. This
property guarantees that two overlapping transla-
tion units can always be combined in our stepwise
bottom-up translation method.

4 More on Interactive Operations
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99992424">
The selection of an equivalent translation is more
than simply choosing among synonyms, as shown in
(Yamabana et al., 1995). First, part-of-speech of
translation equivalent may be specified through this
operation, since translation equivalents with differ-
ent part-of-speech appear distinctly in the alterna-
tives window. Second, the translation equivalent for
functional words can be specified, which can affect
the syntactic structure of the result. Although func-
tional words remain unchanged in the intermediate
representation, some words provide an alternatives
window when the cursor is placed on them. Third,
a whole unit with more than one word can be de-
tected and selected in the same interface as transla-
tion equivalent for a single word.
An example for the first and second point is found
in a translation equivalent set for an auxiliary rareru,
which is known to be highly ambiguous. Even af-
ter leaving aside less frequent &amp;quot;spontaneity&amp;quot; usage
and indirect passivization, there are still at least
three general interpretations: direct passivization,
possibility, and honorific. Automatic disambigua-
tion requires detailed semantic information, espe-
cially when some case elements are missing or hid-
den.

Figure 5 shows the content of the translation

pears when the cursor is placed on that word. If &amp;quot;be

sive morpheme and treated as such in translation. If
the second alternative is chosen, it is interpreted as
honorific. In this case, as the translation equivalent
is shown as a blank, no morpheme appears in the
translation. By choosing the third alternative, it is
translated to an auxiliary &amp;quot;can&amp;quot;, showing capability.
The fourth morpheme translates it to &amp;quot;possibly&amp;quot;, an
adverb. By choosing the fifth alternative, the user
can specify the result to be a complement of an ad-
jective &amp;quot;possible&amp;quot;. A tree for the structure &amp;quot;it is pos-
sible that&amp;quot;, coded in the dictionary, is synthesized in
the generation module.

5 Extension from Basic Model
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999960181818182">
As explained in section 3.1, the method basically as-
sumes simple compositionality of translation. How-
ever, this assumption apparently needs modification
to be applied to broader phenomena. There are
two major sources of violation. One is inherited
attributes, corresponding to constraints posed by
higher nodes to lower ones. Another is idiosyncratic
violation of compositionality assumption, such as id-
iomatic expressions. In this section we describe how
the basic model is extended to treat phenomena that
violates this assumption.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.995692">
5.1 Constraints from Higher Nodes
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999957923076923">
One obvious example of this type of violation is in-
flection. It is not an intrinsic property of a word, but
a constraint by dominating or governing element.
For this reason, its calculation is delayed until the
last phase of generation, when all information are
gathered at the lexical node. In addition, inflec-
tion are re-calculated in every translation, even if
the translation of that word has been already fixed
by a former translation.
Another example is constraint posed by a verb
subcategorization frame to subordinate elements.
Although syntactic cases can be processed by inflec-
tion mechanism, constraint of sentence styles, such

as to-infinitive or gerund, can not be treated in a
similar manner. Since the sentence is a default paus-
ing node, subcategorized sentence usually is already
fixed as a finite form before the constraint is ap-
plied. To cope with this problem, we provide a
bookkeeping mechanism that preserves all partial
syntax trees generated during translation. When
some grammatical constraint is newly introduced on
an already translated expression, and if it requires
structural deformation, the system looks for the reg-
istered structure and generates it again so that it
meets the new constraint.
Figure 6 shows steps to obtain a sentence with an
embedded clause &amp;quot;I help him to read a book&amp;quot;. As
soon as the original sentence (a) is entered, transla-
tion equivalent selection and translation region se-
lection is presented (b). The first region is the com-
plement sentence &amp;quot;he go book wo read no&amp;quot;, where
no is a complement marker. After translation, (c) is
obtained. Then whole sentence is assumed to be the
translation region, and (d) is obtained finally. Please
note the change in the embedded sentence from a fi-
nite form &amp;quot;he read a book&amp;quot; in (c) to an to-infinitive
form &amp;quot;him to read a book&amp;quot; in (d), in accordance
with the grammatical constraint posed by the verb
&amp;quot;help&amp;quot;.

5.2 Idiomatic Expression
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999981705882353">
There are some sets of words that acquire special
syntactic/semantic behavior when appearing simul-
taneously. These idiomatic expressions are another
major source that violates the compositionality as-
sumption of the method. Hereafter, the word &amp;quot;id-
iomatic expression&amp;quot; is used in a rather broad sense:
if translation of a combination of words is not pre-
dictable from their individual behavior, we call it an
idiomatic expression.
In one case, cooccurring words determines trans-
lations of one another, even though their mean-
ing can be understood compositionally. For exam-
ple, renraku-wo toru (contact-OBJ take) should be
translated to &amp;quot;make a contact&amp;quot;, not &amp;quot;take a con-
tact&amp;quot; nor &amp;quot;get a contact&amp;quot;. In another case, the whole
expression can turn into completely another mean-
ing. For example, ashi-wo arau (foot-OBJ wash)
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.997564">
328
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.995456216666667">
can be interpreted as either &amp;quot;wash (one&apos;s) foot&amp;quot; or.
&amp;quot;wash one&apos;s hands&amp;quot;, the latter case losing the orig-
inal meaning of respective words. Although these
idiomatic expressions must be recognized and trans-
lated as one thing, they cannot be registered as one
word in the dictionary, since their elements can ap-
pear in a distant position, or they can also have a
purely compositional interpretation.
To cope with this problem, we extended the trans-
lation equivalent selection interface so that transla-
tion equivalents can be specified as a set for these
expressions. Translation equivalent for the compo-
nent words of an idiomatic expression changes syn-
chronously when one of them is altered. Also, we
expanded the dictionary and morphological analyzer
to allow such multi-word translation unit correspon-
dence.
We give an example with den wa-wo kakeru, an
equivalent expression for &amp;quot;make a phone call&amp;quot;. This
is idiomatic because the correspondence between
kakeru and &amp;quot;make&amp;quot; is peculiar to this interpreta-
tion. When the expression den wa-wokakeru is en-
tered, the morphological analyzer recognizes it as an
idiomatic expression and retrieves information from
the idiom dictionary. Figure 7 is a snapshot of al-
ternatives window for &amp;quot;kakeru&amp;quot;, in the idiomatic in-
terpretation. The second line is highlighted as the
current selection. The leftmost word &amp;quot;make&amp;quot; shows
that the current translation equivalent for &amp;quot;kakeru&amp;quot;,
and the third column shows the current translation
equivalent for the whole expression is &amp;quot;make a phone
call&amp;quot;, an idiomatic interpretation. The alternatives
window for &amp;quot;denwa&amp;quot; is shown in Figure 8. Here, the
word &amp;quot;phone call&amp;quot; is highlighted corresponding to
the interpretation as &amp;quot;make a phone call&amp;quot;. When the
user triggers translation, denwa becomes &amp;quot;a phone
call&amp;quot;, kakeru becomes &amp;quot;make&amp;quot;, producing &amp;quot;make a
phone call&amp;quot; in whole.
If the user changes the selection to another alter-
native, say &amp;quot;telephone&amp;quot; at the third line in the al-
ternatives window kakeru, then the selection in the
alternatives window denwa also changes to the third
line synchronously. Translation of denwa as denwa
shows this word will simply vanish after translation.
Then the translation of whole expression becomes
an one word verb phrase &amp;quot;telephone&amp;quot;.
At the first line of both alternatives window,
the whole original Japanese expression is shown,
with a slash at the boundaries of words, like
denwa/wo/kakeru. This alternative allows the user
to switch from idiomatic interpretation to non-
idiomatic interpretation. If the user chooses this al-
ternative, a new alternatives window containing lit-
eral translation appears as in figure 9. At the same
time the alternatives window for denwa changes and
shows literal translations for denwa. The user can

<bodyText confidence="0.93427632">
The method is realized as an English writing support
software on personal computers. The main function
is divided into two modules, the interface module
and the translation module. The interface module
is in charge of user interaction, morphological analy-
sis and predicting translation equivalent and region,
as well as function as a front-end. The translation
module performs translation of the specified region,
obeying user specification passed by the interface
module. The most important requirement for the
translation module is robustness, in the sense that
it doesn&apos;t drop a word even when specifications are
contradictory. In that case, the system should serve
as a simple online dictionary.
A prominent feature is added in this implementa-
tion: it works as a language conversion front-end to
an arbitrary application. The system is placed be-
tween the keyboard and an application in the data
flow. It captures Japanese input before they are en-
tered to an application, converts it into English, and
then sends the result to the application (figure 10).

of interaction are determined by the user. In this
manner, the user and the system are essentially co-
operative, avoiding the problem of excessive ques-
tioning by the system. The problem of difficulty in
learning interactive operations is also avoided since
our interactions are essentially those of simple Kana-
Kanji conversion operations. We believe an average
user can easily learn operations of our system.
An interactive dependency parser reported in
(Maruyama et al., 1990), is based on an interface
like Kana-Kanji conversion, and shares character-
istics described above2. However, their method is
limited to syntactic dependency disambiguation by
explicitly specifying the words in the dependency re-
lation, and it is difficult to expand the method to
handle the types of ambiguity discussed in this pa-
per.
A user-driven approach to interactive translation,
proposed by (Somers et al., 1990b), is based on cut
and paste operations, where the content of copy
buffer is translated when it is pasted. This method
seems to leave too much burden to the user, since
the user must explicitly specify which portions of the
text should be translated, and in what order. Also
it is not clear how to combine partial translations of
two overlapping expressions, except for direct edit-
ing.
Our stepwise conversion scheme, in which conver-
sion proceeds from smaller structures to larger ones,
is a natural conclusion of our try-and-error-based
conversion approach. As Melby says, a post-editor
will only improve by a certain increment: if the re-
sult is completely wrong, s/he will simply abandon
the whole result. Since it is easier to obtain an ap-
propriate result for a shorter and simpler structure,
a result obtained by stepwise conversion tends to be
of better quality than a result obtained by translat-
ing the whole structure at one step. In other words,
our system divides the translation step into smaller
pieces, and allows post-editing at every step.
As described before, target users of our method
are those who have basic knowledge to read and un-
derstand the target language. According to the tar-
get language skill of the user, useful support func-
tion will be different. For example, for a user who
is competent in English, our system will be useful
as an online dictionary. While writing in English,
the user can look up the system dictionary only by
entering a Japanese word. Then s/he can enjoy easy-
to-use interactive operations for translation equiva-
lent selection, inflection selection and CD-ROM dic-
tionary access. When the user find an appropriate
word, s/he only has to push the return key to enter
the word into the original application. These users

This function is realized using a standard hook and
IME API of the operating system, Microsoft Win-
dows 95. This feature allows this system used as an
add-on function of any application, enabling the user
to work in a familiar document writing environment.
The system dictionary contains about 100,000
Japanese entries and 15,000 idiomatic expressions.
Since there was no source available to build an id-
iom dictionary of this size, they were collected man-
ually from scratch following a method described in
(Tamura et al., 1996). The essence of this method
is limiting search space utilizing distinguished word
classes characteristic to idiomatic expressions, re-
vealed by an intensive analysis of these expressions.
A CD-ROM online dictionary accessing function
is also provided to help user&apos;s translation equivalent
selection.
This software is currently available either as a
package software or a pre-installed software on per-
sonal computers.
7 Discussion
Interactive method in machine translation have been
pursued by many people (Kay, 1973; Melby et al.,
1980; Tomita, 1984; Huang, 1990; Somers et al.,
1990a; Boitet et al., 1995). In these approaches, the
system asks a set of questions to the user to resolve
ambiguities not solvable by itself. Among problems
of this approach are, as Melby pointed out, exces-
sive interaction and necessity for special training for
interactive operations.
In our method, interactive operations are initi-
ated and guided by the user and all interactive op-
erations are optional, except for a small number of
translation triggers needed for translating compo-
nent sentences. The system provides its prediction
as a default selection, and other possibilities as sec-
ond or third choices, but the user is free to obey or
ignore them. If the selection is wrong, the transla-
tion result becomes wrong, which is a feedback to
the user. Then the user can undo the translation,
correct selections, and try again (for example, see
figure 3). On the other hand, the user has only to
repeat &amp;quot;next&amp;quot; instruction to obtain a result of au-
tomatic translation quality. Frequency and content
2These characteristics are inherited essentially from a
Kana-Kanji conversion interface.

will also find it useful to obtain a translation equiv-
alent expression for an idiomatic expression. These
idiomatic expressions, either of source language or
target language, are hard to translate since they do
not allow literal translation and difficult to find in
other dictionaries. By combining this idiom dictio-
nary and translation function, the user can obtain a
useful skeleton for target language expression. For
many users, however, the translation function will be
considered helpful to produce a result of the quality
level that matches their English reading skill. Suit-
able usage will be balanced between the user&apos;s skill
and the capability of the system.
The function as an add-on function to an arbitrary
software will be an advantage equally for all users,
enabling them to work in their familiar environment,
compared to conventional machine-aided translation
systems that force them to work in an independent
unfamiliar environment.
Finally we discuss some remaining problems and
direction of further work.
Translation quality needs continuous effort for im-
provement, in both linguistic coverage and preci-
sion. Precision of initial prediction of translation
equivalent and translation area is crucial to the per-
formance of the system, since they determine the
quality of default translation. In our experience, the
users are willing to use interactive operation to im-
prove translation quality, but never to recover from
incomprehensible output.
We also have to mention some ambiguities difficult
to resolve though basic operations of the method.
An example is grammatical relation ambiguity be-
tween a case element and a verb, when the case
marker is hidden. Generally, the system treats these
cases by producing all possibilities in the order of pri-
ority and allowing the user to choose one. However,
when such ambiguities are multiplied, the number
of possibilities easily grows large, making selection
difficult. One possible solution would be to pro-
vide more disambiguation information, possibly a
sequence of dialogues, to help the user to make de-
cision. An important requirement here is that these
dialogues must not force a response. The user should
be able to ignore them unless they want to.
Another further work is expanding the dictionary,
especially idiomatic expressions. We are also plan-
ning to add translation examples to the knowledge
base, so that translation can be performed either
using grammars or examples in the knowledge base.
These examples are effective to guarantee correct-
ness of the result, hence will be useful even for users
not very familiar in the target language. In this di-
rection, our system would be expanded as a kind of
interactive example-based translation support sys-
tem.

We presented an interactive machine-aided trans-
lation method to support writing in a foreign lan-
guage, which is a combination of dictionary lookup
and interactive machine translation. The transla-
tion proceeds as a cooperative process between the
system and the user, through interactive operations
similar to Kana-Kanji conversion method. We im-
plemented the method as a front-end language con-
version software to an arbitrary application.
