A SYNTACTIC APPROACH TO DISCOURSE SEMANTICS

ABSTRACT
A correct structural analysis of a discourse
is a prerequisite for understanding it. This paper
sketches the outline of a discourse grammar which
acknowledges several different levels of structure.
This grammar, the &amp;quot;Dynamic Discourse Model&amp;quot;, uses
an Augmented Transition Network parsing mechanism
to build a representation of the semantics of a
discourse in a stepwise fashion, from left to right,
on the basis of the semantic representations of the
individual clauses which constitute the discourse.
The intermediate states of the parser model the in-
termediate states of the social situation which ge-
nerates the discourse.
The paper attempts to demonstrate that a dis-
course may indeed be viewed as constructed by means
of sequencing and recursive nesting of discourse
constituents. It gives rather detailed examples
of discourse structures at various levels, and
shows how these structures are described in
the framework proposed here.
I DISCOURSE STRUCTURES AT DIFFERENT LEVELS
If a discourse understanding system is to be
able to assemble the meaning of a complex discourse
fragment (such as a story or an elaborate descrip-
tion) out of the meanings of the utterances consti-
tuting the fragment, it needs a correct structural
analysis of it. Such an analysis is also necessary
to assign a correct semantic interpretation to
clauses as they occur in the discourse; this is
seen most easily in cases where this interpretation
depends on phenomena such as the discourse scope of
temporal and locative adverbials, the movement of
the reference time in a narrative, or the interpre-
tation of discourse anaphora.
The Dynamic Discourse Model, outlined in this
paper, is a discourse grammar under development
which analyses the structure of a discourse in or-
der to be able to deal adequately with its semantic
aspects. It should be emphasized at the outset
that this system is a formal model of discourse
syntax and semantics, but not a computer implemen-
tation of such a model.
For a system to be able to understand a dis-
course, it must be able to analyse it at several
different levels.

participants as belonging to a particular pre-
defined genre -- be it a doctor-patient interaction,
a religious ceremony, or a casual chat. Depending
on the genre, certain participants may have specif-
ic roles in the verbal exchange, and there may be a
predefinedagenda specifying consecutive parts of the
interaction. An interaction which is socially &amp;quot;in-
terpreted&amp;quot; in such a fashion is called a Speech
Event (Hymes,1967,1972).
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9703043125">
3. A stretch of talk within one Speech Event may be
characterized as dealing with one Topic.
4. Within a Topic, we may find one or more Dis-
course Units (DU&apos;s) -- socially acknowledged
units of talk which have a recognizable &amp;quot;point&amp;quot;
or purpose, while at the same time displaying a
specific syntactic/semantic structure. Clear
examples are stories, procedures, descriptions,
and jokes.
5. When consecutive clauses are combined into one
syntactic/semantic unit, we call this unit a
discourse constituent unit (dcu). Examples are:
lists, narrative structures, and various binary
structures (&amp;quot;A but B&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;A because B&amp;quot;, etc.).
6. Adjacency Structures may well be viewed as a
kind of dcu, but they deserve special mention.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.997618066666666">
They are two or three part conversational rou-
tines involving speaker change. The clearest
examples are question-answer pairs and exchanges
of greetings.
7. The smallest units which we shall deal with at
the discourse level are clauses and operators.
Operators include &amp;quot;connectors&amp;quot; like &amp;quot;and&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;or&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;because&amp;quot;, as well as &amp;quot;discourse markers&amp;quot; like
&amp;quot;well&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;so&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;incidentally&amp;quot;.
The levels of discourse structure just dis-
cussed are hierarchically ordered. For instance,
any DU must be part of a Speech Event, while it
must be built up out of dcu&apos;s. The levels may thus
be viewed as an expansion of the familiar linguis-
tic hierarchy of phoneme, morpheme, word and
clause. This does not mean, however, that every
discourse is to be analysed in terms of a five
level tree structure, with levels corresponding to
dcu, DU, Topic, Speech Event and Interaction.
To be able to describe discourse as it actual-
ly occurs, discourse constituents of various types
must be allowed to be embedded in constituents of
the same and other types. We shall see various ex-
amples of this in later sections. It is worth em-
phasizing here already that &amp;quot;high level constitu-
ents&amp;quot; may be embedded in &amp;quot;low level constituents&amp;quot;.
For instance, a dcu may be interrupted by a clause
which initiates another Interaction. Thus, a struc-
tural description of the unfolding discourse would
include an Interaction as embedded in the dcu. In
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.983910641221375">
this way, we can describe &amp;quot;intrusions&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;asides to
third parties&amp;quot;, and other interruptions of one In-
teraction by another.
In the description of discourse semantics, the
level of the dcu&apos;s (including the adjacency struc-
tures) plays the most central role: at this level
the system defines how the semantic representation
of a complex discourse constituent is constructed
out of the semantic representations of its parts.
The other levels of structure are also of some re-
levance, however:
- The Discourse Unit establishes higher level se-
mantic coherence. For instance, the semantics of
different episodes of one story are integrated at
this level.
- The Topic provides a frame which determines the
interpretation of many lexical items and descrip-
tions.
- The Speech Event provides a script which describes
the conventional development of the discourse, and
justifies assumptions about the purposesofdis-
course participants.
- The Interaction specifies referents for indexicals
like &amp;quot;I&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;you&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;here&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;now&amp;quot;.
II THE DYNAMIC DISCOURSE MODEL
Dealina with linguistic structures above the
clause level is an enterprise which differs in an
essential way from the more common variant of lin-
guistic activity which tries to describe the inter-
nal structure of the verbal symbols people exchange.
Discourse linguistics does not study static verbal
objects, but must be involved with the social pro-
cess which produces the discourse -- with the ways
in which the discourse participants manipulate the
obligations and possibilities of the discourse sit-
uation, and with the ways in which their talk is
constrained and framed by the structure of this
discourse situation which they themselves created.
The structure one may assign to the text of a dis-
course is but a reflection of the structure of the
process which produced it.
Because of this, the Dynamic Discourse Model
that we are developing is only indirectly involved
in trying to account for the a posteriori structure
of a finished discourse; instead, it tries to trace
the relevant states of the social space in terms of
which the discourse is constructed. This capability
is obviously of crucial importance if the model is
to be applied in the construction of computer sys-
tems which can enter into actual dialogs.
The Dynamic Discourse Model, therefore, must
construct the semantic interpretation of a dis-
course on a clause by clause basis, from left to
right, yielding intermediate semantic representa-
tions of unfinished constituents, as well as set-
ting the semantic parameters whose values influence
the interpretation of subsequent constituents.
A syntactic/semantic system of this sort may
very well be fromulated as an Augmented Transition
Network grammar (Woods, 1970), a non-deterministic
parsing system specified by a set of transition
networks which may call each other recursively.
Every Speech Event type, DU type and dcu type is
associated with a transition network specifying its
internal structure. As a transition network pro-
cesses the consecutive constituents of a discourse
segment, it builds up, step by step, a representa-
tion of the meaning of the segment. This represen-
tation is stored in a register associated with the
network. At any stage of the Process, this register
contains a representation of the meaning of the dis-
course segment so far.
An ATN parser of this sort models important
aspects of the discourse process. After each clause,
the system is in a well-defined state, characterized
by the stack of active transition networks and, for
each of them, the values in its registers and the
place where it was interrupted. When we say that
discourse participants know &amp;quot;where they are&amp;quot; in a
complicated discourse, we mean that they know which
discourse constituent is being initiated or contin-
ued, as well as which discourse constituents have
been interrupted where and in what order -- in other
words, they are aware of the embedding structure and
other information captured by the ATN configuration.
The meaning of most clause utterances cannot
be determined on the basis of the clause alone, but
involves register values of the embedding dcu -- as
when a question sets up a frame in terms of which its
answer is interpreted (cf. Scha, 1983) or when, to
determine the temporal reference of a clause in a
narrative, one needs a &amp;quot;reference time&amp;quot; which is
established by the foregoing part of the narrative
(section III B 2). From such examples, we see that
the discourse constituent unit serves as a framework
for the semantic interpretation of the clauses which
constitute the text. By the same token, we see that
the semantics of an utterance is not exhaustively
described by indicating its illocutionary force and
its propositional content. An utterance may also
cause an update in one or more semantic registers
of the dcu, and thereby influence the semantic in-
terpretation of the following utterances.
This phenomenon also gives us a useful per-
spective on the notion of interruption which was
mentioned before. For instance, we can now see the
difference between the case of a story being inter-
rupted by a discussion, and the superficially simi-
lar case of a story followed by a discussion which
is, in its turn, followed by another story. In the
first case, the same dcu is resumed and all its
register values are still available; in the second
case, the first story has been finished before the
discussion and the re-entry into a storyworld is
via a different story. The first story has been
closed off and its register values are no longer
avilable for re-activation; the teller of the sec-
ond story must re-initialize the variables of time,
place and character, even if the events of the sec-
ond story concern exactly the same characters and
situations as the first.
Thus, the notions of interruption and resump-
tion have not only a social reality which is expe-
rienced by the interactants involved. They also
have semantic consequences for the building and
interpretation of texts.
Interruption and resumption are often expli-
citly signalled by the occurrence of &amp;quot;discourse
markers&amp;quot;. Interruption is signalled by a PUSH-
marker such as &amp;quot;incidentally&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;by the way&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;you
know&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;like&amp;quot;. Resumption is signalled by a POP-
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.992781717391305">
-markers such as &amp;quot;O.K.&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;well&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;so&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;anyway&amp;quot;.
(For longer lists of discourse marking devices, and
somewhat more discussion of their functioning, see
Reichman (1981) and Polanyi and Scha(1983b).)
In terms of our ATN description of discourse
structure, the PUSH- and POP-markers do almost ex-
actly what their names suggest. A PUSH-marker sig-
nals the creation of a new embedded discourse con-
stituent, while a POP-marker signals a return to an
embedding constituent (though not necessarily the
immediately embedding one), closing off the cur-
rent constituent and all the intermediate ones. The
fact that one POP-marker may thus create a whole
cascade of discourse-POPs was one of Reichman&apos;s
(1981) arguments for rejecting the ATN model of dis-
course structure. We have indicated before, however,
that accommodating this phenomenon is at worst a
matter of minor technical extensions of the ATNfor-
malism (Polanyi and Scha, 1983b); in the present
paper, we shall from now on ignore it.
III DISCOURSE CONSTITUENT UNITS
A. Introduction.
This section reviews some important ways in
which clauses (being our elementary discourse con-
stituent units) can be combined to form complex
discourse constituent units (which, in most cases,
may be further combined to form larger dcu&apos; s, by
recursive application of the same mechanisms). For
the moment, we are thus focussing on the basic dis-
course syntactic patterns which make it possible to
construct complex discourses, and on the semantic
interpretation of these patterns. Sections IV and V
will then discuss the higher level structures, where
the interactional perspective on discourse comes
more to the fore.
To be able to focus on discourse level phe-
nomena, we will assume that the material to be dealt
with by the discourse grammar is a sequence con-
sisting of clauses and operators (connectors and
discourse markers). It is assumed that every clause
carries the value it has for features such asspeak-
er, clause topic, propositional content (represented
by a formula of a suitable logic), preposed consti-
tuents (with thematic role and semantics), tense,
mood, modality. (The syntactic features we must
include here have semantic consequences which can
not always be dealt with within the meaning of the
clause, since they may involve discourse issues.)
The semantics of a dcu is built up in par-
allel with its syntactic analysis, bythelsame re-
cursive mechanism. When clauses or dcu&apos;s are com-
bined to form a larger dcu, their meanings are com-
bined to form the meaning of this dcu. Along with
registers for storing syntactic features and seman-
tic parameters, each dcu has a register which is
used to build up the logical representation of its
meaning.
Since the syntactic and semantic rules op-
erate in parallel, the syntactic rules have the
possibility of referring to the semantics of the
constituents they work on. This possibility is in
fact used in certain cases. We shall see an example
in section III C 1.
Complex discourse constituent units can be
divided into four structurally different types:
- sequences, which construct a dcu out of arbitrar-
ily many constituents (e.g.: lists, narratives).
- expansions, consisting of a clause and a subordi-
nated unit which &amp;quot;expands&amp;quot; on it.
- structures formed by a binary operator, such as
&amp;quot;A because B&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;If A then B&amp;quot;.
- adjacency structures, involving speaker change,
such as question/answer pairs and exchanges of
greetings.
In the next subsections, III B and III C,
we shall discuss sequences and expansions in more
detail. One general point we should like to make
here already: sequences as well as expansions cor-
respond to extensional semantic operations. The
propositions expressing the meanings of their con-
stituents are evaluated with respect to the same
possible world -- the successive constituents sim-
ply add up to one description. (We may note that
some of the binary structures which we shall not
consider further now, certainly correspond to in-
tensional operations. &amp;quot;If A then B&amp;quot; is a clear ex-
ample.)
Since we will not discuss adjacency struc-
tures in any detail in this paper, the problem of
accommodating speaker change and different illocu-
tionary forces in the discourse semantics will be
left for another occasion.

B. Sequential Structures.
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.991602">
We shall discuss three kinds of sequential
structures: lists, narratives, and topic chaining.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.711718">
1. Lists.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9910126875">
Perhaps the paradigmatic sequential
structure is the list: a series of clauses C1&amp;quot;
Ck which have a semantic structure of the form
F(a1) = v,, F(ak) = vk,
i.e., the clauses express propositions which con-
vey the values which one function has for a series
of alternative arguments. For instance, when asked
to describe the interior of a room, someone may
give an answer structured like this:
&amp;quot;When I come into the door,
then I see,
to the left of me on the wall, a large win-
dow (...).
Eh, the wall across from me, there is a eh
basket chair (...).
On the right wall is a mm chair (...).
In the middle of the room there is, from left
to right, an oblong table, next to that a
round table, and next to that a tall cabinet.
Now I think I got everything.&amp;quot;
(Transcript by Ehrich and Koster (1983), translated
from Dutch; the constituents we left out, indicated
by parenthesized dots, are subordinated consti-
tuents appended to the NP they follow.)
The list here occurs embedded under the phrase &amp;quot;I
see&amp;quot;, and is closed off by the phrase &amp;quot;Now I think
I got everything&amp;quot;.
Often, the successive arguments in a
list arementioned ma non-random order -- in the
above case, for instance, we first get the loca-
tions successively encountered in a &amp;quot;glance tour&amp;quot;
from left to right along the walls; then the rest.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.996339">

<bodyText confidence="0.974351653333334">
The ATN description of lists is very simple*:
clause: next
clause: clause:
first &apos; :ext
0 )0 list
Both the first and the next arc parse clauses which
must have the semantic structure F(a) = v. (Whether
a clause can be analysed in this fashion, depends
on surface properties such as stress pattern and
preposing of constituents.) Various registers are
set by the first clause and checked when next
clauses are parsed, in order to enforce agreement
in features such as tense, mood, modality. The se-
mantics of a new clause being parsed is simply
conjoined with the semantics of the list so far.
2. Narratives.
Narratives may be seen as a special case
of lists -- successive event clauses specify what
happens at successive timepoints in the world de-
scribed by the narrative. Narratives are subdivided
into different genres, marked by different tense
and/or person orientation of their main line
clauses: specific past time narratives (marked by
clauses in the simple past, though clauses in the
&amp;quot;historical present&amp;quot; may also occur), generic past
time narratives ( marked by the use of &amp;quot;would&amp;quot; and
&amp;quot;used to&amp;quot;), procedural narratives (present tense),
simultaneous reporting (present tense), plans (use
of &amp;quot;will&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;shall&amp;quot;; present tense also occurs).
We shall from now on focus on specific past narra-
tives. The properties of other narratives turn out
to be largely analogous. (Cf. Longacre (1979) who
suggests treating the internal structure of a dis-
course constituent and its &amp;quot;genre specification&amp;quot; as
two independent dimensions.)
clause:
event
clause:
circumstance
flashback
specific past narrative
All clause-processing arcs in this network
for &amp;quot;specific past narratives&amp;quot; require that the
tense of the clause be present or simple past. The
event arc and the eventi arc process clauses with a
non-durative aspect. The circumstance arc processes
clauses with a durative aspect. (The aspectual ca-
tegory of a clause is determined by the semantic
categories of its constituents. Cf. Verkuyl, 1972.)
The event1 arc is distinguished because it initial-
izes the register settings.
* Notation: All diagrams in this paper have one ini-
tial state (the leftmost one) and one final state
(the rightmost one). The name of the diagram indi-
cates the category of the constituent it parses.
Arcs have labels of the form &amp;quot;A:B&amp;quot; (or sometimes
just &amp;quot;A&amp;quot;), where A indicates the category of the
constituent which must be parsed to traverse the
arc, and B is a label identifying additional con-
ditions and/or actions.
The specific past narrative network has a
time register containing a formula representing
the current reference time in the progression of
the narrative. When the time register has a value
t, an incoming circumstance clause is evaluated at
t, and it does not change the value of the time re-
gister. An event clause, however, is evaluated with
respect to a later but adjacent interval t&apos;, and
resets the time register to an interval t&amp;quot;, later
than but adjacent to t&apos;. (Cf. Polanyi and Scha, 1981)
To show that this gives us the desired
semantic consequences, we consider an abbreviated
version of a detective story fragment, quoted by
Hinrichs (1981):
(El) He went to the window
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.980525166666667">
(E2) and pulled aside the soft drapes.
(Cl) It was a casement window
(C2) and both panels were cranked down to let in
the night air.
(E3) &amp;quot;You should keep this window locked,&amp;quot; he said.
(E4) &amp;quot;It&apos;s dangerous this way.&amp;quot;
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.962269866666667">
The E clauses are events, the C clauses are circum-
stances. The events are evaluated at disjoint, suc-
sessively later intervals. The circumstances are
evaluated at the same interval, between 82 and E3.
To appreciate that the simultaneity of
subsequent circumstance clauses in fact is a con-
sequence of aspectual class rather than a matter of
&amp;quot;world knowledge&amp;quot;, one may compare the sequence
&amp;quot;Be went to the window and pulled aside the soft
drapes&amp;quot; to the corresponding sequence of circum-
stance clauses: &amp;quot;He was going to the window and
was pulling aside the soft drapes&amp;quot;. World knowledge
does come in, however, when one has to decide how
much the validity of a circumstance clause extends
beyond the interval in the narrative sequence where
it is explicitly asserted.
Specific past narratives may also con-
tain other constituents than clauses. An important
case in point is the &amp;quot;flashback&amp;quot; -- an embedded nar-
rative which relates events taking place in a peri-
od before the reference time of the main narrative.
A flashback is introduced by a clause in the plu-
perfect; the clauses which continue it may be in
the pluperfect or the simple past.
clause: f-event
clause:
f-mit pop
0
clause:
)f-circumstance
flashback
The first clause in a flashback (f-mit)
is an event clause; it initializes register set-
tings. The reference time within a flashback moves
according to the same meachanism sketched above for
the main narrative line.
After the completion of a flashback, the
main narrative line continues where it left off
it proceeds from the reference time of the
main narrative. A simple example:
Peter and Mary left the party in a hurry.
Mary had ran into John
and she had insulted him.
So they got into the car
and drove down Avenue C.

3. Topic Chaining
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996309408163266">
Another sequential structure is the
topic chaining structure, where a series of dis-
tinct predications about the same argument are
listed. A topic chain consists of a series of
clausesC,, Ck, with a semantic structure of
the form&apos;Pl (a),... Pk (a), where &amp;quot;a&amp;quot; translates the
topic NP&apos;s of the clauses. In the first clause of
the chain, the topic is expressed by a phrase
(either a full NP or a pronoun) which occurs in
subject position or as a preposed constituent. In
the other clauses, it is usually a pronoun, often
in subject position. An example:
Wilbur&apos;s book I really liked.
It was on relativity theory
and talks mostly about quarks.
I got it while I was working on the initial part
of my research.
(Based on Sidner (1983), example D26.)
The topic chain may be defined by a very
simple transition network.
clause: tcn
clause: clause:
tcl tcn
topic chain
The network has a topic register, which is set by
the first clause (parsed by the tcl arc), which al-
so sets various other registers. The tcn arc tests
agreement in the usual way. As for the topic regis-
ter, we require that the clause being parsed
has a constituent which is interpreted as co-
referential with the value of this register. The
semantics of a topic chain is created by simple
conjunction of the semantics of subsequent constit-
uerits, as in the case of the list.
Lists, narratives and topic chains dif-
fer as to their internal structure, but are distri-
butionally indistinguishable -- they may occur in
identical slots within larger discourse constitu-
ents. For an elegant formulation of the grammar, it
is therefore advantageous to bring them under a
common denominator: we define the notion sequence
to be the union of list, narrative and topic chain.
C. Expansions.
Under the heading &amp;quot;expansions&amp;quot; we describe
two constructions in which a clause is followed by
a unit which expands on it, either by elaborating
its content (&amp;quot;elaborations&amp;quot;) or by describing prop-
erties of a referent introduced by the clause
(&amp;quot;topic-dominant chaining&amp;quot;).
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.62272">
1. Elaborations.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999390208333334">
A clause may be followed by a dcu (a
clause or clause sequence) which expands on its
content, i.e. redescribes it in more detail. For
instance, an event clause may be expanded by a
mini-narrative which recounts the details of the
event. An examnle:
Pedro dined at Madame Gilbert&apos;s.
First there was an hors d&apos;oeuvre.
Then the fish.
After that the butler brought a glazed chicken.
The repast ended with a flaming dessert...
The discourse syntax perspective suggests that in
a case like this, the whole little narrative must
be viewed as subordinated to the clause which pre-
cedes it. We therefore construct one dcu which con-
sists of the first clause plus the following se-
quence.
An illustration of the semantic necessi-
ty of such structural analyses is provided by the
.movement of the reference time in narratives. The
above example (by H. Kamp) appeared in the context
of the discussion about that phenomenon. (Cf. Dow-
ty, 1982) Along with other, similar ones, it was
brought up as complicating the idea that every event
clause in a narrative moves the reference time to a
later interval. We would like to suggest that it is
no coincidence that such &amp;quot;problematic&amp;quot; cases involve
clause sequences belonging to known paragraph types,
and standing in an elaboration relation to the pre-
ceding clause. The reason why they interrupt the
flow of narrative time is simple enough: their
clauses are not direct constituents of the narrative
at all, but constitute their own embedded dcu.
To describe elaborations, we redefine the
notion of a clause to be either an elementary one
or an elaborated one (where the elaboration can be
constituted by a sequence or by a single clause).
sequence
e- clause j&amp;quot; -Ir
e-clause clause
If a clause C is followed by a dcu D, D may be
parsed as an elaboration of C, if C and D may be
plausibly viewed as describing the same situation.
(Note that this is a relation not between the
surface forms of C and D, but between their mean-
ings C&apos; and D&apos;.) When constructing the semantics for
the complex clause, this semantic coherence must al-
so be made explicit.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.407259">
2. Topic-Dominant Chaining.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9319395">
Another phenomenon which gives rise to a
similar structure is &amp;quot;topic-dominant chaining&amp;quot;.
Within a clause with a given topic, certain other
constituents may be identified as possibly dominant*.
A dominant constituent may become the topic of the
next clause or sequence of clauses. We suggest that
such a continuation with a new topic be seen as ex-
panding on the clause before the topic-switch, and
as syntactically subordinated to this.clause. This
subordinated constituent may either be a single
clause or another topic chain sequence.
Similarly, a clause may be followed by a
relative clause, the relative pronoun referring to
a dominant constituent of the embedding clause. Also
in this case, the relative clause may be the first
clause of an embedded topic chain.

(We thus introduce an alternative network for clause
into the grammar, in addition to the one given be-
fore.)
The dominant constituents of the e-clause
are stored in a register; the topic of the topic
chain, as well as the relative pronoun of the rel.
clause must be interpreted as coreferential with one
of those constituents. The topic of topic tail
(a &amp;quot;headless&amp;quot; topic chain) must in its turn corefer
with the relative pronoun.
The semantics consists of simple conjunction.
Both variants of topic-dominant chaining
allowed by the above network are exemplified in
the following text (Sidner, 1983; example D26):

(Indentation indicates subordination with respect to
the most recent less indented clause.) This embed-
ding of constituents by means of topic-dominant
chaining would explain the &amp;quot;focus-stack&amp;quot; which
Sidner (1983) postulates to describe the pronominal
referencephenomena in examples like this.
IV DISCOURSE UNITS
We now leave the discussion of the basic syn-
tactic/semantic mechanisms for building discourse
out of clauses, and turn to the higher levels of
analysis, where considerations involving the goals
of the interaction start to come in. First of all,
we shall discuss the entities which Wald (1978)
calls Discourse Units*, corresponding closely to
the entities which Longacre (1983) simply calls
&amp;quot;Discourses&amp;quot;. Discourse Units (DU&apos;s) are socially
acknowledged units of talk, which have a recogniza-
ble point or purpose, and which are built around
one of the sequential dcu&apos;s discussed in section
III B.
Discourse Unit types which have been inves-
tigated include stories (Labov, 1972; Wald, 1978;
Polanyi, 1978b), descriptions of various sorts
(Linde, 1979; Ehrich and Koster, 1983), procedural
discourse and hortatory discourse (see various re-
ferences in Longacre (1983)).
* Wald restricts his notion to monologic discourse
fragments. It seems reasonable to generalize it to
cases where more than one speaker may be involved.
Because of the pragmatic relation between the Dis-
course Unit and the surrounding talk (specifical-
ly, the need to appear &amp;quot;locally occasioned&amp;quot; (Jef-
ferson, 1979) and to make a &amp;quot;point&amp;quot; (Polanyi,
1978b), the central part of the Discourse Unit
usually is not a piece of talk standing completely
on its own feet, but is supported by one or more
stages of preparatory and introductory talk on one
end, and by an explicit closure and/or conclusion
at the other. This may be illustrated by taking a
closer look at conversationally embedded stories
-- the paradigmatic, and most widely studied, DU
type. specific past
dap,:
en,rance setting narrative dcu:exit
story
A typical story is initiated with entrance
talk which sets the topic and establishes the rela-
tion with the preceding talk. Often we find an ab-
stract, and some kind of negotiation about the ac-
tual telling of the story.
Then follows the &amp;quot;setting&amp;quot; which gives the
necessary background material for the story*. Then
follows the &amp;quot;core&amp;quot;: a specific past narrative, re-
lating a sequence of events. The story is concluded
with &amp;quot;exit talk&amp;quot; which may formulate the point of
the story quite explicitly, connecting the story-
world with more general discourse topics.
For instance, one story in Labov&apos;s (1972)
collection has as its entrance talk an explicit
elicitation and its response to it
Q: What was the most important fight that you
remember, one that sticks in your mind...
A: Well, one (I think) was with a girl.
There is an extensive section describing the set-
ting: &amp;quot;Like I was a kid you know. And she was the
baddest girl, the baddest girl in the neigh-
borhood. If you didn&apos;t bring her candy to
school, she would punch you in the mouthf
and you had to kiss herwhen she&apos;d tell you.
This girl was only twelve years old, man,
but she was a killer. She didn&apos;t take no
junk; she whupped all her brothers.&amp;quot;
Then, the event chain starts, and finally ends:
&amp;quot;And I came to school one day and I didn&apos;t
have any money. (....) And I hit the girl:
powwww! and I put something on it. I win
the fight.&amp;quot;
The story is explicitly closed off:
&amp;quot;That was one of the most important.&amp;quot;
Not every specific past narrative may be
the core of a story. Because of the interactional
status of the story (its requirement to be &amp;quot;point-
ful&amp;quot;) there are other properties which are notice-
able in the linguistic surface structure -- notably
the occurrence of &amp;quot;evaluation&amp;quot; (Polanyi, 1978b) and
of a &amp;quot;peak&amp;quot; in the narrative line (Lonoacre,1093).
* That the necessary background material must be
given before the actual event sequence, is attested
by a slightly complicated storytelling strategy,
described in Polanyi (1978a) as the &amp;quot;True Start&amp;quot;
repair: the storyteller first plunges right into
the event sequence, then breaks off the narrative
line and restarts the telling of the story, now
with the insertion of the proper background data.

The structural description of stories,
given above, should probably be further elaborated
to account for the phenomenon of episodes: a story
may be built by consecutive pieces of talk which
constitute separate narrative dcu&apos;s. At the level
of the story DU, the meanings of these narratives
must be integrated to form a description of one
storyworld rather than many.
In English and other Western European lan-
guages, the Discourse Unit seems to be a largely
interactional notion. Its constituents are pieces
of talk defined by the independently motivated dcu-
grammar. The DUgrannaronly imposes constraints on
the content-relations between its constituent
dcu&apos;s; it does not define structures which an ade-
quate dcu grammar would not define already.
In other languages of the world, the situation
seems to be somewhat different: there are syntac-
tically defined ways for building DU&apos;s out of dcu&apos;s,
which were not already part of the dcu grammar.
For details, one should investigate, for instance,
the various works referred to in Longacre
(1983). Also in this body of work, however, one can
find numerous cases where the structural difference
between a DU (&amp;quot;Discourse&amp;quot;, inLongacre&apos;sterms) and
the corresponding sequential dcu (&amp;quot;paragraph&amp;quot;, in
his terms) is not very clear.
V INTERACTIONS AND SPEECH EVENTS
The system we present here is intended to
analyze the verbal material occurring in one
Interaction. By an Interaction we mean a social
situation in which a set of participants is in-
volved in an exchange of talk. Each of the partici-
pants knows to be taking part in this situation,
arid assigns to the others the same awareness. By
focussing on one interaction, we single out, from
all the talk that may be going on at one place at
the same time, the talk which belongs together be-
cause it is intended to be part of the same social
situation. (Cf. Goffman, 1979)
The set of participants of an Interaction
determines the possible speakers and addressees of
the talk occurring in it. Similarly, the physical
time and place of an interaction provide the ref-
erents for indexicals like &amp;quot;now&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;here&amp;quot;.
A simple two person Interaction would be
described as an exchange of greetings, followed
by a piece of talk as defined by a lower level of
the grammar, followed by an exchange of farewells.
Greetings and farewells are the only kinds of talk
which directly engage the Interaction level of
description -- they correspond to signing on and
signing off to the list of participants.
An &amp;quot;unframed&amp;quot; interaction between &amp;quot;unin-
terpreted&amp;quot; people is a rare event. People use a
refined system of subcategorization to classify
the social situations they engage in. These sub-
categories, which we shall call Speech Event types
(cf. Hymes, 1967, 1972), often assign a specific
purpose to the interaction, specify roles for the
participants, constrain discourse topics and
conversational registers, and, inmany cases,
specify a conventional sequence of component acti-
vities.
The most precisely circumscribed kinds of
Speech Events are formal rituals. Speech Event types
characterized by grammars which are less explicit
and less detailed include service encounters (Mer-
ritt, 1978), doctor-patient interactions (Byrne and
Long, 1976), and casual conversations.
The structure of talk which is exchanged
in order to perform a task will follow the structure
of some goal/subgoal analysis of this task (Grosz,
1977). In Speech Event types which involve a more
or less fixed goal, this often leads to a fixed
grammar of subsequent steps taken to attain it. For
instance, students looking at transcripts of the on-
goings in a Dutch butchershop, consistently found
the following sequential structure in the interac-
tion between the butcher and a customer:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.840196222222222">
1. establishing that it is this customer&apos;s turn.
2. the first desired item is ordered, and the order
is dealt with, , the n-th desired item is
ordered and the order is dealt with.
3. it is established that the sequence of orders
is finished.
4. the bill is dealt with.
5. the interaction is closed off.

butchershop interaction
Each of these steps is filled in in a large varie-
ty of ways -- either of the parties may take the
initiative at each step, question/answer sequences
about the available meat, the right way to prepare
it, or the exact wishes of the customer may all be
embedded in the stage 2 steps, and clarification
dialogs of various sorts may occur. In other words,
we find the whole repertoire of possibilities ad-
mitted by the dcu grammar ( particularly, the part
dealing with the possible embeddings of adjacency
structures within each other).
Thus, we note that the arcs in a Speech
Event diagram such as the above do not impose syn-
tactic constraints on the talk they will parse.The
labels on the arcs stand for conditions on the con-
tent of the talk -- i.e., on the goals and topics
that it may be overtly concerned with.
An important Speech Event type with
characteristics slightlydifferent from the types
mentioned so far, is the &amp;quot;casual conversation&amp;quot;.
In a casual conversation, all participants have
the same role: to be &amp;quot;equals&amp;quot;; no purposes are pre-
established; and the range of possible topics is
open-ended, although conventionally constrained.
VI INTERRUPTION REVISITED
One Speech Event type may occur embedded
in another one. It may occupy a fixed slot in it,
as when an official gathering includes an informal
prelude or postlude, where people don&apos;t act in
their official roles but engage in casual conver-
sation. (Goffman, 1979) Or, the embedding may occur
at structurally arbitrary points, as when a Service
Encounter in a neighborhood shop is interrupted for
smalltalk.
The latter case may be described by tacit-
ly adding to each state in the Service Encounter
network a looping arc which PUSHes to the Casual

<abstract confidence="0.998914911196911">A correct structural analysis of a discourse is a prerequisite for understanding it. This paper sketches the outline of a discourse grammar which acknowledges several different levels of structure. This grammar, the &amp;quot;Dynamic Discourse Model&amp;quot;, uses an Augmented Transition Network parsing mechanism to build a representation of the semantics of a discourse in a stepwise fashion, from left to right, on the basis of the semantic representations of the individual clauses which constitute the discourse. The intermediate states of the parser model the intermediate states of the social situation which generates the discourse. The paper attempts to demonstrate that a discourse may indeed be viewed as constructed by means of sequencing and recursive nesting of discourse constituents. It gives rather detailed examples of discourse structures at various levels, and shows how these structures are described in the framework proposed here. STRUCTURES AT DIFFERENT LEVELS If a discourse understanding system is to be able to assemble the meaning of a complex discourse fragment (such as a story or an elaborate description) out of the meanings of the utterances constituting the fragment, it needs a correct structural analysis of it. Such an analysis is also necessary to assign a correct semantic interpretation to clauses as they occur in the discourse; this is seen most easily in cases where this interpretation depends on phenomena such as the discourse scope of temporal and locative adverbials, the movement of the reference time in a narrative, or the interpretation of discourse anaphora. The Dynamic Discourse Model, outlined in this paper, is a discourse grammar under development which analyses the structure of a discourse in order to be able to deal adequately with its semantic aspects. It should be emphasized at the outset that this system is a formal model of discourse syntax and semantics, but not a computer implementation of such a model. For a system to be able to understand a discourse, it must be able to analyse it at several different levels. 1. Any piece of talk must be assigned to one Interaction-i.e., to a socially constructed verbal exchange which has, at any moment, awell-defined set of participants. 2. Virtually every interaction is viewed by its as belonging to a particular predefined genre -be it a doctor-patient interaction, a religious ceremony, or a casual chat. Depending on the genre, certain participants may have specific roles in the verbal exchange, and there may be a predefinedagenda specifying consecutive parts of the interaction. An interaction which is socially &amp;quot;inin such a fashion is called a Event(Hymes,1967,1972). 3. A stretch of talk within one Speech Event may be as dealing with one Topic. 4. Within a Topic, we may find one or more Dis- Units(DU&apos;s) -socially acknowledged units of talk which have a recognizable &amp;quot;point&amp;quot; or purpose, while at the same time displaying a specific syntactic/semantic structure. Clear examples are stories, procedures, descriptions, and jokes. 5. When consecutive clauses are combined into one syntactic/semantic unit, we call this unit a constituent unit(dcu). Examples are: lists, narrative structures, and various binary structures (&amp;quot;A but B&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;A because B&amp;quot;, etc.). Adjacency Structuresmay well be viewed as a kind of dcu, but they deserve special mention. They are two or three part conversational routines involving speaker change. The clearest examples are question-answer pairs and exchanges of greetings. 7. The smallest units which we shall deal with at discourse level are clausesand operators. Operators include &amp;quot;connectors&amp;quot; like &amp;quot;and&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;or&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;because&amp;quot;, as well as &amp;quot;discourse markers&amp;quot; like &amp;quot;well&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;so&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;incidentally&amp;quot;. The levels of discourse structure just discussed are hierarchically ordered. For instance, any DU must be part of a Speech Event, while it must be built up out of dcu&apos;s. The levels may thus be viewed as an expansion of the familiar linguistic hierarchy of phoneme, morpheme, word and clause. This does not mean, however, that every discourse is to be analysed in terms of a five level tree structure, with levels corresponding to dcu, DU, Topic, Speech Event and Interaction. To be able to describe discourse as it actually occurs, discourse constituents of various types must be allowed to be embedded in constituents of the same and other types. We shall see various examples of this in later sections. It is worth emphasizing here already that &amp;quot;high level constituents&amp;quot; may be embedded in &amp;quot;low level constituents&amp;quot;. For instance, a dcu may be interrupted by a clause which initiates another Interaction. Thus, a structural description of the unfolding discourse would include an Interaction as embedded in the dcu. In 413 this way, we can describe &amp;quot;intrusions&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;asides to third parties&amp;quot;, and other interruptions of one Interaction by another. In the description of discourse semantics, the level of the dcu&apos;s (including the adjacency structures) plays the most central role: at this level the system defines how the semantic representation of a complex discourse constituent is constructed out of the semantic representations of its parts. The other levels of structure are also of some relevance, however: - The Discourse Unit establishes higher level semantic coherence. For instance, the semantics of different episodes of one story are integrated at this level. - The Topic provides a frame which determines the interpretation of many lexical items and descriptions. - The Speech Event provides a script which describes the conventional development of the discourse, and justifies assumptions about the purposesofdiscourse participants. - The Interaction specifies referents for indexicals like &amp;quot;I&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;you&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;here&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;now&amp;quot;. II THE DYNAMIC DISCOURSE MODEL Dealina with linguistic structures above the clause level is an enterprise which differs in an essential way from the more common variant of linguistic activity which tries to describe the internal structure of the verbal symbols people exchange. Discourse linguistics does not study static verbal objects, but must be involved with the social process which produces the discourse -with the ways in which the discourse participants manipulate the obligations and possibilities of the discourse situation, and with the ways in which their talk is constrained and framed by the structure of this discourse situation which they themselves created. The structure one may assign to the text of a discourse is but a reflection of the structure of the process which produced it. Because of this, the Dynamic Discourse Model that we are developing is only indirectly involved in trying to account for the a posteriori structure of a finished discourse; instead, it tries to trace the relevant states of the social space in terms of which the discourse is constructed. This capability is obviously of crucial importance if the model is to be applied in the construction of computer systems which can enter into actual dialogs. The Dynamic Discourse Model, therefore, must construct the semantic interpretation of a discourse on a clause by clause basis, from left to right, yielding intermediate semantic representations of unfinished constituents, as well as setting the semantic parameters whose values influence the interpretation of subsequent constituents. A syntactic/semantic system of this sort may very well be fromulated as an Augmented Transition Network grammar (Woods, 1970), a non-deterministic parsing system specified by a set of transition networks which may call each other recursively. Every Speech Event type, DU type and dcu type is associated with a transition network specifying its internal structure. As a transition network processes the consecutive constituents of a discourse segment, it builds up, step by step, a representation of the meaning of the segment. This representation is stored in a register associated with the network. At any stage of the Process, this register contains a representation of the meaning of the discourse segment so far. An ATN parser of this sort models important aspects of the discourse process. After each clause, the system is in a well-defined state, characterized by the stack of active transition networks and, for each of them, the values in its registers and the place where it was interrupted. When we say that discourse participants know &amp;quot;where they are&amp;quot; in a complicated discourse, we mean that they know which discourse constituent is being initiated or continued, as well as which discourse constituents have been interrupted where and in what order -in other words, they are aware of the embedding structure and other information captured by the ATN configuration. The meaning of most clause utterances cannot be determined on the basis of the clause alone, but involves register values of the embedding dcu -as when a question sets up a frame in terms of which its answer is interpreted (cf. Scha, 1983) or when, to determine the temporal reference of a clause in a narrative, one needs a &amp;quot;reference time&amp;quot; which is established by the foregoing part of the narrative (section III B 2). From such examples, we see that the discourse constituent unit serves as a framework for the semantic interpretation of the clauses which constitute the text. By the same token, we see that the semantics of an utterance is not exhaustively described by indicating its illocutionary force and its propositional content. An utterance may also cause an update in one or more semantic registers of the dcu, and thereby influence the semantic interpretation of the following utterances. This phenomenon also gives us a useful perspective on the notion of interruption which was mentioned before. For instance, we can now see the difference between the case of a story being interrupted by a discussion, and the superficially similar case of a story followed by a discussion which is, in its turn, followed by another story. In the first case, the same dcu is resumed and all its register values are still available; in the second case, the first story has been finished before the discussion and the re-entry into a storyworld is via a different story. The first story has been closed off and its register values are no longer avilable for re-activation; the teller of the second story must re-initialize the variables of time, place and character, even if the events of the second story concern exactly the same characters and situations as the first. Thus, the notions of interruption and resumption have not only a social reality which is experienced by the interactants involved. They also have semantic consequences for the building and interpretation of texts. Interruption and resumption are often explicitly signalled by the occurrence of &amp;quot;discourse markers&amp;quot;. Interruption is signalled by a PUSHmarker such as &amp;quot;incidentally&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;by the way&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;you or &amp;quot;like&amp;quot;. Resumption is signalled by a POP- 414 -markers such as &amp;quot;O.K.&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;well&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;so&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;anyway&amp;quot;. (For longer lists of discourse marking devices, and somewhat more discussion of their functioning, see Reichman (1981) and Polanyi and Scha(1983b).) In terms of our ATN description of discourse structure, the PUSHand POP-markers do almost exactly what their names suggest. A PUSH-marker signals the creation of a new embedded discourse constituent, while a POP-marker signals a return to an embedding constituent (though not necessarily the immediately embedding one), closing off the current constituent and all the intermediate ones. The fact that one POP-marker may thus create a whole cascade of discourse-POPs was one of Reichman&apos;s (1981) arguments for rejecting the ATN model of discourse structure. We have indicated before, however, that accommodating this phenomenon is at worst a matter of minor technical extensions of the ATNformalism (Polanyi and Scha, 1983b); in the present paper, we shall from now on ignore it.</abstract>
