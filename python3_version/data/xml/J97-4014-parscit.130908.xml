A new lexical theory of complex predicates is
proposed in this volume. Although the theory
is presented in detail primarily for German
expressions of these predicates, consideration
is given to cross-linguistic application of this
theory.

Bernd Heine
Bernd Heine argues that the structure of
grammatical categories is predictable to a large
extent once we know the range of possible cog-
nitive structures from which they are derived.
The author uses as his example the structure of
predicative possession, and shows how most of
the possessive constructions to be found in the
world&apos;s languages can be traced back to a small
set of basic conceptual patterns.

This volume mainly analyzes the structural
properties of collections or pluralities (with
applications to the philosophy of set theory),
homogeneous objects such as water, and the
semantics and philosophy of events. This book
thereby complements algebraic work that has
been done on other philosophical entities, i.e.
propositions, properties, relations, or situations.

&amp;quot;Adaptive Behavior&apos;s undying theme
is the study of issues in the analysis or
design of autonomous agents: that is,
agents [such as animals; creaturelike,
mobile robots (animate); or, software
agents in virtual realities] capable of
coordinating perception and action for
extended periods of time in unknown
and potentially hostile environments.
Such coordinated activity is referred to
as adaptive behavior if it increases the
likelihood of survival. ...This journal
offers a unique forum for the exchange
of ideas and the study of adaptive
behavior in general ...[and is] the
authoritative publication in the field. ...
[The journal&apos;s] editors account for
most of the influential researchers in
this young field. [F]or scientists with
interests in the common ground where
studies of natural and synthetic
autonomous agents meet, it should
become essential reading.&amp;quot;
Nature
&amp;quot;The new multidisciplinary journal
Adaptive Behavior publishes
research from robotics, artificial
intelligence, cognitive science,
psychology, behavioral ecology
and ethology . . . on the principles
underlying adaptive behavior in
living or artificial beings. Research
especially focuses on the bottom-up
approach to understanding
behaviour.. . Nearly all papers
contain testable models [predomi-
nantly neural networks, parallel
distributed processing and genetic
algorithms] that address real and
interesting behavioural problems . .
The papers are of a high standard.&amp;quot;

<bodyText confidence="0.6985784">
Manuscxripts for Computational Linguistics should be submitted on letter-size paper (8.5 by
11 inches, or A4), double-spaced and single-sided throughout, including footnotes and refer-
ences. The paper should begin with an informative abstract of approximately 150-250 words.
Manuscripts must be written in English. Contact the editor regarding the possibility of electronic
submission.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.957555">
Submissions may be made in any of the following categories:
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99365875">
Papers: This category includes contributions that report significant new research results in com-
putational linguistics or that provide critical reviews of the literature on a particular topic. The
length of a paper depends on its content, but it is suggested that manuscripts be limited to forty
double-spaced pages. That is the equivalent of thirty journal pages. Each paper is fully refereed,
being read by at least two members of the editorial board and &apos;usually by an additional expert
in the particular subject area. The submission of an article to CL for refereeing means that the
author certifies the manuscript is not copyrighted; nor has it been published or submitted for
publication to another refereed journal. If any version Of the paper has appeared, or will appear,
in a non-refereed publication, the details of such publication must be made known to the Edi-
tor at the time of submission. The final version of a paper tentatively accepted for publication
must be accompanied by a Copyright Transfer Agreement signed by all of the authors or, in the
case of a &amp;quot;work for hire,&amp;quot; by the employer. This written transfer is necessary under the 1978
U.S. Copyright law.
Letters to the Editor: This category includes statements of opinion on issues relevant to the
readership. The Editor and the editorial board will evaluate the appropriateness of these con-
tributions for inclusion.

Founded in 1962, the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) is the primary scientific and
professional society for natural language processing research and applications. A European chapter was
established in 1982. Besides publishing Computational Linguistics, the ACL holds international meetings
(annually in North America, biennially in Europe) where the state-of-the-art in natural language
processing research and development is presented. Recently, special interest groups on the Mathematics of
Language, the Lexicon, Parsing, Generation, Computational Phonology, and Multimedia Language
Processing have been formed; others are likely to be added.

Contact the editor regarding the possibility of electronic submission. Submissions may be made in any of the following categories: category includes contributions that report significant new research results in computational linguistics or that provide critical reviews of the literature on a particular topic. The length of a paper depends on its content, but it is suggested that manuscripts be limited to forty double-spaced pages. That is the equivalent of thirty journal pages. Each paper is fully refereed, being read by at least two members of the editorial board and &apos;usually by an additional expert in the particular subject area. The submission of an article to CL for refereeing means that the author certifies the manuscript is not copyrighted; nor has it been published or submitted for publication to another refereed journal. If any version Of the paper has appeared, or will appear, in a non-refereed publication, the details of such publication must be made known to the Editor at the time of submission. The final version of a paper tentatively accepted for publication must be accompanied by a Copyright Transfer Agreement signed by all of the authors or, in the case of a &amp;quot;work for hire,&amp;quot; by the employer. This written transfer is necessary under the 1978 U.S. Copyright law. to the Editor: category includes statements of opinion on issues relevant to the readership.

A European chapter was in 1982. Besides publishing Linguistics, ACL holds international meetings (annually in North America, biennially in Europe) where the state-of-the-art in natural language processing research and development is presented. Recently, special interest groups on the Mathematics of Language, the Lexicon, Parsing, Generation, Computational Phonology, and Multimedia Language Processing have been formed; others are likely to be added.</abstract>
