As described in this paper, we propose
a new automatic evaluation method for
machine translation using noun-phrase
chunking. Our method correctly deter-
mines the matching words between two
sentences using corresponding noun
phrases. Moreover, our method deter-
mines the similarity between two sen-
tences in terms of the noun-phrase or-
der of appearance. Evaluation experi-
ments were conducted to calculate the
correlation among human judgments,
along with the scores produced us-
ing automatic evaluation methods for
MT outputs obtained from the 12 ma-
chine translation systems in NTCIR-
7. Experimental results show that
our method obtained the highest cor-
relations among the methods in both
sentence-level adequacy and fluency.

High-quality automatic evaluation has be-
come increasingly important as various ma-
chine translation systems have developed. The
scores of some automatic evaluation meth-
ods can obtain high correlation with human
judgment in document-level automatic evalua-
tion(Coughlin, 2007). However, sentence-level
automatic evaluation is insufficient. A great
gap exists between language processing of au-
tomatic evaluation and the processing by hu-
mans. Therefore, in recent years, various au-
tomatic evaluation methods particularly ad-
dressing sentence-level automatic evaluations
have been proposed. Methods based on word
strings (e.g., BLEU(Papineni et al., 2002),
NIST(NIST, 2002), METEOR(Banerjee and
Lavie., 2005), ROUGE-L(Lin and Och, 2004),

and IMPACT(Echizen-ya and Araki, 2007))
calculate matching scores using only common
words between MT outputs and references
from bilingual humans. However, these meth-
ods cannot determine the correct word corre-
spondences sufficiently because they fail to fo-
cus solely on phrase correspondences. More-
over, various methods using syntactic analyt-
ical tools(Pozar and Charniak, 2006; Mutton
et al., 2007; Mehay and Brew, 2007) are pro-
posed to address the sentence structure. Nev-
ertheless, those methods depend strongly on
the quality of the syntactic analytical tools.
As described herein, for use with MT sys-
tems, we propose a new automatic evaluation
method using noun-phrase chunking to obtain
higher sentence-level correlations. Using noun
phrases produced by chunking, our method
yields the correct word correspondences and
determines the similarity between two sen-
tences in terms of the noun phrase order of ap-
pearance. Evaluation experiments using MT
outputs obtained by 12 machine translation
systems in NTCIR-7(Fujii et al., 2008) demon-
strate that the scores obtained using our sys-
tem yield the highest correlation with the hu-
man judgments among the automatic evalua-
tion methods in both sentence-level adequacy
and fluency. Moreover, the differences be-
tween correlation coefficients obtained using
our method and other methods are statisti-
cally significant at the 5% or lower signifi-
cance level for adequacy. Results confirmed
that our method using noun-phrase chunking
is effective for automatic evaluation for ma-
chine translation.

2.1 Correspondence of Noun Phrases
by Chunking
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999987222222222">
The system obtains the noun phrases from
each sentence by chunking. It then determines
corresponding noun phrases between MT out-
puts and references calculating the similarity
for two noun phrases by the PER score(Su et
al., 1992). In that case, PER scores of two
kinds are calculated. One is the ratio of the
number of match words between an MT out-
put and reference for the number of all words
of the MT output. The other is the ratio of the
number of match words between the MT out-
put and reference for the number of all words
of the reference. The similarity is obtained as
an F-measure between two PER scores. The
high score represents that the similarity be-
tween two noun phrases is high. Figure 1
presents an example of the determination of
the corresponding noun phrases.

part”, “the amount” and “crowning drop” are
obtained in the reference by chunking. Next,
the system determines the corresponding noun
phrases from these noun phrases between the
MT output and reference. The score between
“the end” and “the end part” is the highest
among the scores between “the end” in the
MT output and “it”, “the end part”, “the
amount”, and “crowning drop” in the refer-
ence. Moreover, the score between “the end
part” and “the end” is the highest among the
scores between “the end part” in reference
and “the amount”, “the crowning fall”, “the
end” in the MT output. Consequently, “the
end” and “the end part” are selected as noun
phrases with the highest mutual scores: “the
end” and “the end part” are determined as one
corresponding noun phrase. In Fig. 1, “the
amount” in the MT output and “the amount”
in reference, and “the crowning fall” in the
MT output and “crowning drop” in the ref-
erence also are determined as the respective
corresponding noun phrases. The noun phrase
for which the score between it and other noun
phrases is 0.0 (e.g., “it” in reference) has no
corresponding noun phrase. The use of the
noun phrases is effective because the frequency
of the noun phrases is higher than those of
other phrases. The verb phrases are not used
for this study, but they can also be generated
by chunking. It is difficult to determine the
corresponding verb phrases correctly because
the words in each verb phrase are often fewer
than the noun phrases.

In Eq. (1), β is a parameter for length
weighting of common parts; it is greater than
1.0. Figure 2 portrays an example of deter-
mination of the common parts. In the first
process of Fig. 2, LCS is 7. In this example,
several LCS routes exist. The system selects
the LCS route which has “,”, “the amount
of”, “crowning”, “is”, and “.” as the com-
mon parts. The common part is the part
for which the common words appear contin-
uously. In contrast, IMPACT selects a differ-
ent LCS route that includes “, the”, “amount
of”, “crowning”, “is”, and “.” as the com-
mon parts. In IMPACT, using no analytical
knowledge, the LCS route is determined using
the information of the number of words in the
common parts and the position of the com-
mon parts. The RS for LCS route selected
using our method is 32 (= 12.0 + (2 + 2 +
1)2.0 + 22.0 + 12.0 + 12.0) when β is 2.0. The
RS for LCS route selected by IMPACT is 19
(= (1 + 1)2.0 + (2 + 1)2.0 + 22.0 + 12.0 + 12.0).
In the LCS route selected by IMPACT, the
weight of “the” in the common part “, the”
is 1 because “the” in the reference is not in-
cluded in the corresponding noun phrase. In
the LCS route selected using our method, the
weight of “the” in “the amount of” is 2 because
“the” in MT output and “the” in the reference
are included in the corresponding noun phrase
“NP1”. Therefore, the system based on our
method can select the correct LCS route.
Moreover, the word-level score is calculated
using the common parts in the selected LCS
route as the following Eqs. (3), (4), and (5).

Equation (3) represents recall and Eq. (4)
represents precision. Therein, m signifies the
word number of the reference in Eq. (3), and
n stands for the word number of the MT out-
put in Eq. (4). Here, RN denotes the repe-
tition number of the determination process of
the LCS route, and i, which has initial value 0,
is the counter for RN. In Eqs. (3) and (4), α
is a parameter for the repetition process of the
determination of LCS route, and is less than
1.0. Therefore, Rwd and Pwd becomes small
as the appearance order of the common parts
between MT output and reference is different.
Moreover, length(c) represents the number of
words in each common part; β is a param-
eter related to the length weight of common
parts, as in Eq. (1). In this case, the weight
of each common word in the common part is
1. The system calculates scorewd as the word-
level score in Eq. (5). In Eq. (5), γ is deter-
mined as Pwd/Rwd. The scorewd is between
0.0 and 1.0.

We calculated the correlation between the
scores obtained using our method and scores
produced by human judgment. The system
based on our method obtained the evaluation
scores for 1,200 English output sentences re-
lated to the patent sentences. These English
output sentences are sentences that 12 ma-
chine translation systems in NTCIR-7 trans-
lated from 100 Japanese sentences. Moreover,
the number of references to each English sen-
tence in 100 English sentences is four. These
references were obtained from four bilingual
humans. Table 1 presents types of the 12 ma-
chine translation systems.
Moreover, three human judges evaluated
1,200 English output sentences from the per-
spective of adequacy and fluency on a scale of
1–5. We used the median value in the evalua-
tion results of three human judges as the final
scores of 1–5. We calculated Pearson’s correla-
tion efficient and Spearman’s rank correlation
efficient between the scores obtained using our
method and the scores by human judgments in
terms of sentence-level adequacy and fluency.
Additionally, we calculated the correlations
between the scores using seven other methods
and the scores by human judgments to com-

In Tables 2–5, the “Avg.” score of our method
is shown to be higher than those of other meth-
ods. Especially in terms of the sentence-level
adequacy shown in Tables 2 and 4, “Avg.”
of our method is about 0.03 higher than that
of IMPACT. Moreover, in system No. 8 and
“All” of Tables 2 and 4, the differences be-
tween correlation coefficients obtained using
our method and IMPACT are statistically sig-
nificant at the 5% significance level.
Moreover, we investigated the correlation of
machine translation systems of every type. Ta-

translation systems in SMT and the scores of
200 output sentences obtained by 2 machine
translation systems in RBMT are used respec-
tively. However, EBMT is not included in Ta-
ble 6 because EBMT is only system No. 9.
In Table 6, our method obtained the highest
correlation among the eight methods, except
in terms of the adequacy of RBMT in Pear-
son’s correlation coefficient. The differences
between correlation coefficients obtained us-
ing our method and IMPACT are statistically
significant at the 5% significance level for ad-
equacy of SMT.
To confirm the effectiveness of noun-phrase
chunking, we performed the experiment using
a system combining BLEU with our method.
In this case, BLEU scores were used as scorewd
in Eq. (13). This experimental result is shown
as “BLEU with our method” in Tables 2–5. In
the results of “BLEU with our method” in Ta-
bles 2–5, underlining signifies that the differ-
ences between correlation coefficients obtained
using BLEU with our method and BLEU alone
are statistically significant at the 5% signif-
icance level. The coefficients of correlation
for BLEU with our method are higher than
those of BLEU in any machine translation sys-
tem, “Avg.” and “All” in Tables 2–5. More-
over, for sentence-level adequacy, BLEU with
our method is significantly better than BLEU
in almost all machine translation systems and
“All” in Tables 2 and 4. These results indicate
that our method using noun-phrase chunking
is effective for some methods and that it is
statistically significant in each machine trans-
lation system, not only “All”, which has large
sentences.
Subsequently, we investigated the precision
of the determination process of the corre-
sponding noun phrases described in section
2.1: in the results of system No. 1, we cal-
culated the precision as the ratio of the num-
ber of the correct corresponding noun phrases
for the number of all noun-phrase correspon-
dences obtained using the system based on our
method. Results show that the precision was
93.4%, demonstrating that our method can de-
termine the corresponding noun phrases cor-
rectly.

tween the correlation obtained by our method
and the quality of chunking. In “Our method”
shown in Tables 2–5, noun phrases for which
some erroneous results obtained using the
chunking tool were revised. “Our method II”
of Tables 2–5 used noun phrases that were
given as results obtained using the chunk-
ing tool. Underlining in “Our method II” of
Tables 2–5 signifies that the differences be-
tween correlation coefficients obtained using
our method II and IMPACT are statistically
significant at the 5% significance level. Fun-
damentally, in both “Avg.” and “All” of Ta-
bles 2–5, the correlation coefficients of our
method II without the revised noun phrases
are lower than those of our method using the
revised noun phrases. However, the difference
between our method and our method II in
“Avg.” and “All” of Tables 2–5 is not large.
The performance of the chunking tool has no
great influence on the results of our method
because scorewd in Eqs. (3), (4), and (5) do
not depend strongly on the performance of
the chunking tool. For example, in sentences
shown in Fig. 2, all common parts are the
same as the common parts of Fig. 2 when “the
crowning fall” in the MT output and “crown-
ing drop” in the reference are not determined
as the noun phrases. Other common parts are
determined correctly because the weight of the
common part “the amount of” is higher than
those of other common parts by Eqs. (1) and
(2). Consequently, the determination of the
common parts except “the amount of” is not
difficult.
In other language sentences, we already per-
formed the experiments using Japanese sen-
tences from Reuters articles(Oyamada et al.,
2010). Results show that the correlation co-
efficients of IMPACT with our method, for
which IMPACT scores were used as scorewd in
Eq. (13), were highest among some methods.
Therefore, our method might not be language-
dependent. Nevertheless, experiments using
various language data are necessary to eluci-
date this point.

quently, the system obtains scores using the
correctly matched words and phrase-level in-

<abstract confidence="0.998632285714286">As described in this paper, we propose a new automatic evaluation method for machine translation using noun-phrase chunking. Our method correctly determines the matching words between two sentences using corresponding noun phrases. Moreover, our method determines the similarity between two sentences in terms of the noun-phrase order of appearance. Evaluation experiments were conducted to calculate the correlation among human judgments, along with the scores produced using automatic evaluation methods for MT outputs obtained from the 12 machine translation systems in NTCIR- 7. Experimental results show that our method obtained the highest correlations among the methods in both sentence-level adequacy and fluency.</abstract>

A great gap exists between language processing of automatic evaluation and the processing by humans. Therefore, in recent years, various automatic evaluation methods particularly addressing sentence-level automatic evaluations have been proposed. Methods based on word strings (e.g., BLEU(Papineni et al., 2002), NIST(NIST, 2002), METEOR(Banerjee and Lavie., 2005), ROUGE-L(Lin and Och, 2004), Kenji Araki Hokkaido University N 14-Jo, W 9-Chome, Kita-ku, Sapporo, 060-0814 Japan araki@media.eng.hokudai.ac.jp and IMPACT(Echizen-ya and Araki, 2007)) calculate matching scores using only common words between MT outputs and references from bilingual humans. However, these methods cannot determine the correct word correspondences sufficiently because they fail to focus solely on phrase correspondences. Moreover, various methods using syntactic analytical tools(Pozar and Charniak, 2006; Mutton et al., 2007; Mehay and Brew, 2007) are proposed to address the sentence structure. Nevertheless, those methods depend strongly on the quality of the syntactic analytical tools. As described herein, for use with MT systems, we propose a new automatic e</context>

For example, in sentences shown in Fig. 2, all common parts are the same as the common parts of Fig. 2 when “the crowning fall” in the MT output and “crowning drop” in the reference are not determined as the noun phrases. Other common parts are determined correctly because the weight of the common part “the amount of” is higher than those of other common parts by Eqs. (1) and (2). Consequently, the determination of the common parts except “the amount of” is not difficult. In other language sentences, we already performed the experiments using Japanese sentences from Reuters articles(Oyamada et al., 2010). Results show that the correlation coefficients of IMPACT with our method, for which IMPACT scores were used as scorewd in Eq. (13), were highest among some methods. Therefore, our method might not be languagedependent. Nevertheless, experiments using various language data are necessary to elucidate this point. 4 Conclusion As described herein, we proposed a new automatic evaluation method for machine transla115 Table 5: Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient for sentence-level fluency.

Tables 2 and 3 respectively show Pearson’s correlation coefficient for sentence-level adequacy and fluency. Tables 4 and 5 respectively show Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient for sentence-level adequacy and fluency. In Tables 2–5, bold typeface signifies the maximum correlation coefficients among eight automatic evaluation methods. Underlining in our method si</context>

Secondly, the system calculates word-level scores based on the correct matched words using the determined correspondences of noun phrases. Next, the system calculates phrase-level scores based on the noun-phrase order of appearance. The system calculates the final scores combining word-level scores and phrase-level scores. 2.1 Correspondence of Noun Phrases by Chunking The system obtains the noun phrases from each sentence by chunking. It then determines corresponding noun phrases between MT outputs and references calculating the similarity for two noun phrases by the PER score(Su et al., 1992). In that case, PER scores of two kinds are calculated. One is the ratio of the number of match words between an MT output and reference for the number of all words of the MT output. The other is the ratio of the number of match words between the MT output and reference for the number of all words of the reference. The similarity is obtained as an F-measure between two PER scores. The high score represents that the similarity between two noun phrases is high. Figure 1 presents an example of the determination of the corresponding noun phrases. (1) Use of noun phrase chunking MT output : in gene</context>
