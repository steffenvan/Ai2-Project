Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.9999201875">
GLOSSER is designed to support read-
ing and learning to read in a foreign lan-
guage. There are four language pairs cur-
rently supported by GLOSSER: English-
Bulgarian, English-Estonian, English-
Hungarian and French-Dutch. The pro-
gram is operational on UNIX and Windows
&apos;95 platforms, and has undergone a pilot
user-study. A demonstration (in UNIX)
for Applied Natural Language Processing
emphasizes components put to novel tech-
nical uses in intelligent computer-assisted
morphological analysis (ICALL), including
disambiguated morphological analysis and
lemmatized indexing for an aligned bilin-
gual corpus of word examples.

1 Motivation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999323466666667">
GLOSSER applies natural language processing tech-
niques, especially morphological processing and cor-
pora analysis, to technology for intelligent computer-
assisted language learning (ICALL).
The project vision foresees that intermediate lan-
guage learners/users of e.g., English, perhaps a na-
tive speaker of Bulgarian, might be reading on the
screen, perhaps a software manual. We imagine such
a user encountering an unknown word or an unfamil-
iar use of a known word, e.g., reverts as in:
&amp;quot;This action reverts the buffer to the form stored
on disk&amp;quot;
The user can click the mouse on a word to invoke
online help (following a dynamically generated hy-
perlink), which provides:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.937862166666667">
1. a morphological parse, separating &apos;revert&apos; and
&apos;s&apos;, together with an explanation of the signifi-
cance of the inflection (&apos;s&apos;)-3rd person singular
present tense;
2. the entry to the word &apos;revert&apos; in a bilingual
English/Bulgarian dictionary or a monolingual
English one;
3. access to similar examples of the word in online
bilingual corpora; and
4. an audible pronunciation. (This is included
only to demonstrate further capabilities, and is
available only for a small number of words.)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.984930052631579">
The example of English for Bulgarians is chosen
for illustration. Software has also been devel-
oped for English/Estonian, English/Hungarian and
French/Dutch.
If we assume a rudimentary level of instruction
in foreign-language grammar, then a great deal of
the learning required in order to read is simply vo-
cabulary learning, which is best pursued in context
(Krashen, 1989; Swaffar, Arens, and Byrnes, 1991).
GLOSSER makes this as easy and accurate as pos-
sible: vocabulary is always presented in context,
moreover in texts which the teacher or student may
choose. Analyses, dictionary explanations and fur-
ther examples are but a mouse click away.
The project has developed demonstrators as a
proof of concept, and, in order to promote use,
the demonstrators run on both UNIX and Windows
&apos;95. The prototypes have proven sufficiently robust
to support reading of essentially all non-specialized

texts. They have further permited a pilot user-study
which is being followed up by broader usability stud-
ies at two sites. The initial results showed that
users enjoyed the intelligent dictionary and were a
bit faster in reading.
The demonstrators have been tested by students,
but they might also be put to use to support read-
ing directly by people who are not engaged in formal
language instruction, or perhaps not even primarily
interested in improving their foreign langauge abil-
ity. Given our emphasis on automatic methods ap-
plicable to arbitrary texts, a spin-off in support for
translations is conceivable.
(Nerbonne and Smit, 1996) provides more on
the ICALL background against which GLOSSER
was developed. GLOSSER distinguishes itself from
many ICALL programs by its emphasis on language
use as opposed to drill and test, by its ability to
support nearly any level of text difficulty, and by
its emphasis on effectively removing the tedium of
dictionary use from intermediate language learning.

ules for morphological analysis and disambiguation,
dictionary access, and (indexed) corpora search with
an output module. The &amp;quot;suggestive&amp;quot; pronunciation
module is not shown.
The core modules provide the information noted
in Section 1, (1-3): morphology, bilingual dictio-
nary entry, and examples from use. A fourth (user-
interface and display) module controls interaction
with the user and formats the information provided.
Among other things, it allows the range of informa-
tion to be tailored to individual preference.
The usefulness of the first two sorts of information
is evident. We chose to include the third sort as well
because corpora seemed likely to be valuable in pro-
viding examples more concretely and certainly more
extensively than other sources. They may provide a
sense of collocation or even nuances of meaning.
The realization of these design goals required ex-
tensive knowledge bases about morphology and the
lexicon.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.6143068">
• Most crucially, the morphological knowledge
base provides the link between the inflected
forms found in texts and the &amp;quot;citation forms&amp;quot;
found in dictionaries (Sproat, 1992). LEMMA-
TIZATION recovers citation forms from inflected
forms and is a primary task of morphological
analysis. A substantial morphological knowl-
edge base is likewise necessary if one is to pro-
vide information about the grammatical signif-
icance of morphological information.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999708692307692">
The only effective means of providing such a
knowledge base is through morphological anal-
ysis software. Even if one could imagine stor-
ing all the inflected forms of a language such as
French, the information associated with those
forms is available today only from analysis soft-
ware. The software is needed to create the store
of information.
Even apart from this: people occasionally cre-
ate new words. Analysis programs can provide
information about these, since most are formed
according to very general and regular morpho-
logical processes.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.930630333333333">
• Obviously, the quality of the online dictionary is
absolutely essential. The only feasible option is
to use an existing dictionary. Our investigative
user study indicates that the dictionary is the
most important factor in user satisfaction.
• The essential design questions vis-à-vis the cor-

pus were (i) how large must the corpus be in
order to guarantee a high expectation that the
most frequent words would be found; and (ii)
what sort of access techniques are needed on
a corpus of the requisite size—given that access
must succeed within at most a very few seconds.
We tried to use texts from a variety of genres,
and we attempted (with some limited success)
to find bilingual English-Bulgarian, English-
Estonian and French-Dutch texts.

We have just completed a more careful replication with more students at a lower level of French proficiency, and the predictions of the pilot are borne out: there are very significant differences in speed, insignificant advantages in comprehension, and high overall sat-isfaction (Dokter et al., to appear 1997). GLOSSER was likewise fortunate in obtaining the use of good online dictionaries: the Van Dale dictio- Frans Dale, 1993) is used for French-Dutch, and the Kernermann semi-bilingual are used for mapping English to Buland Hungarian. Only the Esto-nian version is complete. Although there are no paper versions of the latter available, (Kernermann Publishing, 1993) demonstrates the basic concept for English-Finnish. 4 Conclusions 2.3 Corpus GLOSSER was developed with the philosophy of ex-ploiting available NLP technology wherever possi-ble. Morphological analysis (lemmatization) is ro-bust and accurate and more than up to the task We have relied on other projects, the ECI and MUL-TEXT for bilingual corpora, although this has in-volved some work in (re)aligning the texts. The results of disambiguation and morphological analysis serve not only as input to dictionary lookup but also to corpus search. The current implementa-tion of this search uses a LExEmE-based index for rapid and varied access to the corpus.</abstract>
<note confidence="0.93715925">In order to determine the size of corpus needed, we experimented with a frequency list of the 10, 000 most frequent word forms. A corpus of 2 MB con-tained 85% of these, and a corpus of 6 MB 100%. Our goal is 100% coverage of the words (lemmata) found in the 30,000-word dictionaries, and 100% coverage of the most frequent 20,000 words. The current corpus size is 8 MB.

We tried to use texts from a variety of genres, and we attempted (with some limited success) to find bilingual English-Bulgarian, EnglishEstonian and French-Dutch texts. 2.1 Morphological Analysis As we have seen, morphological analysis is necessary if one wishes to access an online dictionary. Since broad-coverage analysis packages represent very major development efforts, GLOSSER was fortunate in having use of Locolex, a state-of-the-art system from Rank Xerox (Bauer, Segond, and Zaenen, 1995). output 136 A French example analysis (from Figure 2): UNIX server), it became apparent that some sort • atteignissent as of indexing was needed.

The initial results showed that users enjoyed the intelligent dictionary and were a bit faster in reading. The demonstrators have been tested by students, but they might also be put to use to support reading directly by people who are not engaged in formal language instruction, or perhaps not even primarily interested in improving their foreign langauge ability. Given our emphasis on automatic methods applicable to arbitrary texts, a spin-off in support for translations is conceivable. (Nerbonne and Smit, 1996) provides more on the ICALL background against which GLOSSER was developed. GLOSSER distinguishes itself from many ICALL programs by its emphasis on language use as opposed to drill and test, by its ability to support nearly any level of text difficulty, and by its emphasis on effectively removing the tedium of dictionary use from intermediate language learning. 2 Technical Realization GLOSSER is designed with four major components, which are sketched in Figure 1.

We chose to include the third sort as well because corpora seemed likely to be valuable in providing examples more concretely and certainly more extensively than other sources. They may provide a sense of collocation or even nuances of meaning. The realization of these design goals required extensive knowledge bases about morphology and the lexicon. • Most crucially, the morphological knowledge base provides the link between the inflected forms found in texts and the &amp;quot;citation forms&amp;quot; found in dictionaries (Sproat, 1992). LEMMATIZATION recovers citation forms from inflected forms and is a primary task of morphological analysis. A substantial morphological knowledge base is likewise necessary if one is to provide information about the grammatical significance of morphological information. The only effective means of providing such a knowledge base is through morphological analysis software. Even if one could imagine storing all the inflected forms of a language such as French, the information associated with those forms is available today only from analysis software. The software is needed to create the store </context>
