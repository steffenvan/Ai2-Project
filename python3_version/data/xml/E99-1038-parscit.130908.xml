We present an operable definition of focus
which is argued to be of a cognito-pragmatic
nature and explore how it is determined in
discourse in a formalized manner. For this
purpose, a file card model of discourse model
and knowledge store is introduced enabling the
decomposition and formal representation of its
determination process as a programmable

from social and cognitive psychology is cited
and the prospect of the integration of focus via
FDA as a discourse-level construct into speech

1. Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999768517241379">
The present paper aims to propose a working
definition of focus and thereupon explore how focus
is determined in discourse; in doing so, it hopes to
contribute to the potential integration of a focus
module into speech synthesis systems, in particular,
concept-to-speech ones. The motivation largely
derives from the observation that focus, though
recognized as &apos;the meeting point of linguistics and
artificial intelligence&apos; (Hajicova, 1987) carrying
significant discourse information closely related to
prosody generation, has nonetheless appeared evasive
and intractable to formalization. Most current speech
synthesis systems simply take focus as the point of
departure in an a priori manner whilst few have
looked into the issue of how focus occurs as it is,
namely, how focus is determined (by the speaker
presumably) in the discourse. We aim to redress this
inadequacy by first defining focus as a cognito-
pragmatic category, which then enables a formal and
procedural characterization of focus determination
process in discourse, captured as focus determination
algorithm (FDA). The FDA to be proposed is largely
based on human-human dialogue (though space
consideration precludes the full presentation of data),
but is believed to be applicable to human-computer
interaction as well. The study is characterized by its
interdisciplinary approach, combining insights and
inputs from linguistics, neuroscience and social
psychology.

2. Defining focus: a cognito-pragmatic
category
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999912479166667">
The term focus has been used in various senses, at
least six of which can be identified, i.e., phonological
(Pierrehumbert, 1980; Ladd, 1996), semantic
(Jackendoff, 1972; Prince, 1985), syntactic
(Rochemont, 1986), cognitive (Sanford &amp; Garrod,
1981; Musseler et al., 1995), pragmatic (Halliday,
1967), and AI-focus (Grosz &amp; Sidner, 1986)&apos;. We
argue that, first, these multiple uses of focus, though
resulting in conceptual confusion, hint at the central
status of the notion in core as well as peripheral
linguistics. Second, focus as occurs in discourse is
best captured by referring to both the interlocutors&apos;
cognitive computation and constant interaction, in
accordance with the dual (i.e., cognitive and
pragmatic) nature of discourse per se (Nuyts, 1992).
Of the six above-mentioned senses, the cognitive and
pragmatic ones serve as the basis for the present
definition, although the caveat is immediately made
that the two aspects are to be fully integrated rather
than merely added together. Moreover, neither is to be
adopted blindly given certain shortcomings of
previous accounts of each, such as a general
vagueness militating against their effective
application in speech technology.
In this connection, we define focus as a cognito-
pragmatic category, calling for the introduction of the
cognitive construct of discourse model in relation to
knowledge store. Presumably, every typical adult
communicator has at his/her disposal a vast and
extensive knowledge store relating to the scenes and
events occurring in the world he/she is in. The
contents of the store are acquired via direct perception
of the environment and, less directly, communication
with others or reflection upon past acquisitions.
Discourse entails the employment and deployment of
the knowledge store, but in a specific discourse only a
subset of it deemed relevant to the on-going discourse
is incurred, given the economy principle of human
cognitive system (Wilkes, 1997). We refer to this
subset of knowledge store (KS) in operation for and in
a given discourse as discourse model (DM) and hold
it as bearing directly on focus. Following Levelt
(1989:114), DM is &apos;a speaker&apos;s record of what he
believes to be shared knowledge about the content of
the discourse as it evolved&apos; (my italics). Thus, it is a
cognitive construct incorporating an interactive
dimension of speaker-hearer mutual assessment; it is
also an ongoing, dynamic one being constantly
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.669655666666667">
Though it needs to be cautioned that such a division into these six
senses is more an analytic expedient than implying there is clear-cut
boundaries between them.

updated as discourse progresses. Similarly, the DM
and the KS are related in a dynamic way allowing for
potentially constant, on-line interaction during the
discourse which we refer to as &apos;dynamic inclusion&apos;.
This implies that when &apos;off-line&apos; (i.e., when no
discourse is actively going on), DM is included in KS,
as indicated in Figure 1 below. By comparison, when
&apos;on-line&apos; (i.e., when participants are engaged in a
discourse), the dynamic dimension becomes evident
in both their inter-relation and the internal structuring
of DM, as illustrated in Figure 2.

<bodyText confidence="0.984729481481482">
Figure 2 deserves more explanation as the on-
line state of and potential operations on the DM serve
as the basis for focus determination in actual
discourse. We argue that DM is crucially structured
internally and for its representation we adopt the file
card model based on the file metaphor in Heim (1983)
(cf. also Reinhart, 1981; Vallduvi, 1992; Erteschik-
Shir, 1997). A DM consists of a stack of file cards,
and each card contains (maximally) three categories
of items, viz., discourse referent (serving as index to
and address of the card), attribute(s) and link(s), the
first being obligatory whilst the latter two optional.
Moreover, a card has one and only one referent but
may have none, one or more attributes and links.
Borrowing the notion of activation from Chafe (1987),
we distinguish three zones, i.e., activated zone (AZ),
semi-activated zone (SAZ) and inactivated zone (IAZ),
within the DM&apos;. Similar to the case of the DM-KS
relation, the boundaries between the three zones are
fluid rather than fixed, as is evident in Figure 2.
Armed with these machinery, we thus define
focus as &apos;whatever is in the activated zone (AZ)&apos;, or,
more precisely, whatever is at the top of the stack in
AZ of the (speaker&apos;s version of the hearer&apos;s) DM as a
result of immediately recent operations such as
retrieval and updating at a given moment in the
discourse (Zuo, 1999).

3. Focus determination algorithm (FDA)
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998482222222222">
Apparently, this definition of focus also renders the
process of focus determination fairly transparent. The
postulation of DM and KS enables the decomposition
and characterization of the focus determination
process in an explicit and formalized manner.
Discourse is thereby reducible, to a considerable
extent, to the operations on the file cards, most
crucially, adding, updating, locating and relocating of
the cards across the three zones. In this vein, a card
that is newly added to AZ (note not what is in AZ), or
an item that is newly entered onto a card already in
AZ at a specific moment is assigned focus-hood, if
and only if the time interval between current moment
and the moment for the addition/entry is shorter than a
time threshold set on independent cognitive grounds
(see below for more discussion). This process of focus
determination can be represented as the following
algorithm.

assigned focus-hood? Obviously a slick (and vague)
&apos;idea or thought&apos; misses the point here. A look at the
internal organization of the DM again suggests the
answer. Corresponding to the content of the file card,
four cases can be identified as to what can become the
focus: (1) the discourse referent, (2) the attribute, (3)
the link, and (4) the card as a whole. Note that this
breakdown analysis meshes well with findings in
psycholinguistic researches, for example, the possible
candidates for acquiring &apos;conceptual prominence&apos;
distinguished in Levelt (1989:151). The file card
model offers a more rigorous and operable way to
account for such cases: Lines 16-18 and 20-23
respectively capture the above-mentioned cases (1)
and (4) (though the former is apparently also a special
type of case (4)) whilst Lines 29-31 and 36-38
respectively represent cases (2) and (3). Note that
lines 16-18 and 20-23 show that a card may be added
to AZ (and hence assigned focus-hood) either ad
externo or by retrieving from SAZ or IAZ of the current
DM.
Second, a crucial assumption of this algorithm is
that speech planning consists of conceptual planning
and linguistic planning proceeding in a sequential
fashion; this is a well-established argument in psycho-
linguistics (Garrett, 1980), and the former proceeds in
a unit-by-unit fashion (though the picture is more
complicated for the latter) (Taylor &amp; Taylor, 1990).
Hence, the &apos;message unit&apos; used in this algorithm (see
Lines 2, 6, and 9) refers to such planning unit and can
be roughly understood as &apos;chunk of meaning&apos;; as such
it consists minimally of a referent and an attribute
while the link is optional; The &apos;ender&apos; in Line 2 refers
to the message unit intended by the speaker to
terminate his/her current contribution. Obviously,
here the speaker&apos;s intention plays a vital role. Note
that the ender is also a conceptual unit in nature, and
we leave open the question whether such enders
constitute a closed, limited set with a relatively small
number of prototypical units.
Third, the formula ci = Ri (+Ai) (+Li) in Line 11
indicates the make-up of the card, with the brackets
standing for optionality (see Section 2). Also in this
line, the function COMPARE (a, b) is defined as
COMPARE a AGAINST b {C„z}(and {CsAz}, (C,Az} in the
remainder of the algorithm) stands for the set
comprised by the file cards already in AZ (or SAZ and
IAZ, for that matter) at the current moment.
Fourth, T, (LI7), T, (Ls 22, 36) and Tc (L39) refer to a
point in time, in comparison with Tt (L38) which is an
interval of time. They serve as input to the Card
Manager sub-program which keeps track of the
&apos;transportation&apos;, i.e., retrieval and deposition, of the
cards. Thus, the RECORD (time) function (Ls 17, 22, 30,
and 37), together with the Card Manager, takes care of
the on-line shuffling and reshuffling of the file cards
and is mainly responsible for the dynamism of DM.
Regarding the choice of the threshold time Tt (L39),
we argue that it is presumably the critical time
conditioned by the capacity of the working memory;
but we leave open its specific value and on what
terms, absolute or relative, it should be defined (for
different views, cf. Carpenter, 1988; Liebert, 1997;
Givon, 1983; Barbosa &amp; Bailly, 1994). At present,
the commonly-employed practice (which is also that
adopted here) is to set a time threshold in terms of the
length of some independently delimited discourse
segments (e.g. those in Rhetoric Structure Theory
(Hirscheberg, 1993)). We admit this inadequacy and
wish to address it fully with inputs from
interdisciplinary researches in the future.
Finally, the AZ, SAZ and IAZ in the algorithm
refer to the hearer&apos;s DM as assessed by the speaker in
discourse, i.e., the speaker&apos;s version of the hearer&apos;s
DM, as the hearer&apos;s true DM is only accessible to s/he
her/himself.

4. Evidence from social and cognitive
psychology
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999950585365853">
Crucially, the validity of FDA is contingent on (i) to
what extent it is possible for the speaker to
conceptualize the hearer&apos;s DM and (ii) on what
independent grounds is the tripartite division of the
DM justified? For the former question we invoke the
notion of intersubjectivity from social psychology and
for the latter, research findings in cognitive
psychology are cited.
Stemming initially from the observation in social
psychology that discourse participants have to
constantly &apos;put themselves in each other&apos;s shoes&apos; in
order to achieve communicative goals (cf.
Rommetveit, 1974; Clark, 1985), intersubjectivity is
primarily concerned with perspective-taking, or,
perspectivization (Sanders &amp; Spooren 1997). It
implies that discourse is a negotiating process and that
understanding in discourse has to be sufficiently
intersubjective. Hence, it is both necessary and
possible for the speaker to assess the hearer&apos;s DM, and
this is achieved through intersubjectivity. Admittedly,
this process is not infallible, given Linell&apos;s (1995)
observation regarding misunderstanding in discourse;
nonetheless, it can be carried out with relative
sufficiency which primarily depends on the
participants&apos; communicative competence and their
expectation of the discourse.
A theory of discourse processing must also be a
theory of cognition and memory; this is especially
true for focus, given its attested relevance to memory.
Researches on knowledge storage and processing in
human memory in cognitive psychology have favored
a dual memory system, i.e. working memory (wm)
and long-term memory (LTM) (Baddeley, 1990) and a
tripartite taxonomy of LTM into procedural, semantic,
and episodic storage systems (Tulving, 1985). More-
over, wm serves as a portal to early episodic memory,
and both are characterized by a limited capacity and
rapid decay: the content in wm is periodically emptied
into first, early episodic memory, then long-term
episodic memory system, and thereafter semantic
memory system. (e.g. Gathercole &amp; Baddeley, 1993).

Proceedings of EACL &apos;99
This representation dovetails nicely with our present
account of focus and FDA. Specifically, a rough
parallel may be drawn between, first, wm and AZ,
second, early episodic memory and SAZ &amp; IAZ, third,
long-term episodic memory &amp; semantic memory and
IAZ &amp; KS, and fourth, the dynamic working of
knowledge processing and that of FDA, in particular
the Card Manager which takes charge of the make-up
of DM by constantly monitoring the timing and
subsequently shuffling and reshuffling cards.

5. Integration of a focus module into speech
synthesis systems
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999954722222222">
FDA, presented here on the basis of an operable
definition of focus, enables the integration of a focus
module into speech synthesis system; specifically, the
output of FDA, i.e., the focus pattern of the message
conveyed by the utterance, may be fed into a
subsequent accent assignment module, one in the
spirit of the Focus-Accent Theory of Dirksen (1992)
and Dirksen &amp; Quene (1993).
In this way, FDA entertains a great potential for
the integration of discourse-level information into
prosody generation system, and thereby the
production of more discourse-felicitous prosody.
Moreover, given that FDA starts with conceptual
planning of message, its integration is particularly
suitable for Concept-to-speech systems. As a final
note, we suggest that its fundamental rationale is
arguably also highly pertinent to Text-to-speech
systems, which, however, cannot be elaborated here.

Second, a crucial assumption of this algorithm is that speech planning consists of conceptual planning and linguistic planning proceeding in a sequential fashion; this is a well-established argument in psycholinguistics (Garrett, 1980), and the former proceeds in a unit-by-unit fashion (though the picture is more complicated for the latter) (Taylor &amp; Taylor, 1990). Hence, the &apos;message unit&apos; used in this algorithm (see Lines 2, 6, and 9) refers to such planning unit and can be roughly understood as &apos;chunk of meaning&apos;; as such it consists minimally of a referent and an attribute while the link is optional; The &apos;ender&apos; in Line 2 refers to the message unit intended by the speaker to terminate his/her current contribution.

Researches on knowledge storage and processing in human memory in cognitive psychology have favored a dual memory system, i.e. working memory (wm) and long-term memory (LTM) (Baddeley, 1990) and a tripartite taxonomy of LTM into procedural, semantic, and episodic storage systems (Tulving, 1985). Moreover, wm serves as a portal to early episodic memory, and both are characterized by a limited capacity and rapid decay: the content in wm is periodically emptied into first, early episodic memory, then long-term episodic memory system, and thereafter semantic memory system. (e.g. Gathercole &amp; Baddeley, 1993). 259 Proceedings of EACL &apos;99 This representation dovetails nicely with our present account of focus and FDA. Specifically, a rough parallel may be drawn between, first, wm and AZ, second, early episodic memory and SAZ &amp; IAZ, third, long-term episodic memory &amp; semantic memory and IAZ &amp; KS, and fourth, the dynamic working of knowledge processing and that of FDA, in particular the Card Manager which takes charge of the make-up of DM by constantly monitoring the timing and subsequently shuffling and reshuffling cards. 5.

Introduction The present paper aims to propose a working definition of focus and thereupon explore how focus is determined in discourse; in doing so, it hopes to contribute to the potential integration of a focus module into speech synthesis systems, in particular, concept-to-speech ones. The motivation largely derives from the observation that focus, though recognized as &apos;the meeting point of linguistics and artificial intelligence&apos; (Hajicova, 1987) carrying significant discourse information closely related to prosody generation, has nonetheless appeared evasive and intractable to formalization. Most current speech synthesis systems simply take focus as the point of departure in an a priori manner whilst few have looked into the issue of how focus occurs as it is, namely, how focus is determined (by the speaker presumably) in the discourse. We aim to redress this inadequacy by first defining focus as a cognitopragmatic category, which then enables a formal and procedural characterization of focus determination process in discourse, captu</context>

The contents of the store are acquired via direct perception of the environment and, less directly, communication with others or reflection upon past acquisitions. Discourse entails the employment and deployment of the knowledge store, but in a specific discourse only a subset of it deemed relevant to the on-going discourse is incurred, given the economy principle of human cognitive system (Wilkes, 1997). We refer to this subset of knowledge store (KS) in operation for and in a given discourse as discourse model (DM) and hold it as bearing directly on focus. Following Levelt (1989:114), DM is &apos;a speaker&apos;s record of what he believes to be shared knowledge about the content of the discourse as it evolved&apos; (my italics). Thus, it is a cognitive construct incorporating an interactive dimension of speaker-hearer mutual assessment; it is also an ongoing, dynamic one being constantly Though it needs to be cautioned that such a division into these six senses is more an analytic expedient than implying there is clear-cut boundaries between them. 257 Proceedings of EACL &apos;99 updated as discourse progresses.

Obviously a slick (and vague) &apos;idea or thought&apos; misses the point here. A look at the internal organization of the DM again suggests the answer. Corresponding to the content of the file card, four cases can be identified as to what can become the focus: (1) the discourse referent, (2) the attribute, (3) the link, and (4) the card as a whole. Note that this breakdown analysis meshes well with findings in psycholinguistic researches, for example, the possible candidates for acquiring &apos;conceptual prominence&apos; distinguished in Levelt (1989:151). The file card model offers a more rigorous and operable way to account for such cases: Lines 16-18 and 20-23 respectively capture the above-mentioned cases (1) and (4) (though the former is apparently also a special type of case (4)) whilst Lines 29-31 and 36-38 respectively represent cases (2) and (3). Note that lines 16-18 and 20-23 show that a card may be added to AZ (and hence assigned focus-hood) either ad externo or by retrieving from SAZ or IAZ of the current DM.

For the former question we invoke the notion of intersubjectivity from social psychology and for the latter, research findings in cognitive psychology are cited. Stemming initially from the observation in social psychology that discourse participants have to constantly &apos;put themselves in each other&apos;s shoes&apos; in order to achieve communicative goals (cf.

For the former question we invoke the notion of intersubjectivity from social psychology and for the latter, research findings in cognitive psychology are cited. Stemming initially from the observation in social psychology that discourse participants have to constantly &apos;put themselves in each other&apos;s shoes&apos; in order to achieve communicative goals (cf. Rommetveit, 1974; Clark, 1985), intersubjectivity is primarily concerned with perspective-taking, or, perspectivization (Sanders &amp; Spooren 1997).

Note that lines 16-18 and 20-23 show that a card may be added to AZ (and hence assigned focus-hood) either ad externo or by retrieving from SAZ or IAZ of the current DM. Second, a crucial assumption of this algorithm is that speech planning consists of conceptual planning and linguistic planning proceeding in a sequential fashion; this is a well-established argument in psycholinguistics (Garrett, 1980), and the former proceeds in a unit-by-unit fashion (though the picture is more complicated for the latter) (Taylor &amp; Taylor, 1990). Hence, the &apos;message unit&apos; used in this algorithm (see Lines 2, 6, and 9) refers to such planning unit and can be roughly understood as &apos;chunk of meaning&apos;; as such it consists minimally of a referent and an attribute while the link is optional; The &apos;ender&apos; in Line 2 refers to the message unit intended by the speaker to terminate his/her current contribution. Obviously, here the speaker&apos;s intention plays a vital role. Note that the ender is also a conceptual unit in nature, and we leave open the question whether such enders constitute a closed, limited set with a relatively small number of pro</context>

A theory of discourse processing must also be a theory of cognition and memory; this is especially true for focus, given its attested relevance to memory. Researches on knowledge storage and processing in human memory in cognitive psychology have favored a dual memory system, i.e. working memory (wm) and long-term memory (LTM) (Baddeley, 1990) and a tripartite taxonomy of LTM into procedural, semantic, and episodic storage systems (Tulving, 1985). Moreover, wm serves as a portal to early episodic memory, and both are characterized by a limited capacity and rapid decay: the content in wm is periodically emptied into first, early episodic memory, then long-term episodic memory system, and thereafter semantic memory system. (e.g. Gathercole &amp; Baddeley, 1993). 259 Proceedings of EACL &apos;99 This representation dovetails nicely with our present account of focus and FDA. Specifically, a rough parallel may be drawn between, first, wm and AZ, second, early episodic memory and SAZ &amp; IAZ, third, long-term episodic memory &amp; semantic memory and IAZ </context>

We argue that DM is crucially structured internally and for its representation we adopt the file card model based on the file metaphor in Heim (1983) (cf. also Reinhart, 1981; Vallduvi, 1992; ErteschikShir, 1997). A DM consists of a stack of file cards, and each card contains (maximally) three categories of items, viz., discourse referent (serving as index to and address of the card), attribute(s) and link(s), the first being obligatory whilst the latter two optional. Moreover, a card has one and only one referent but may have none, one or more attributes and links. Borrowing the notion of activation from Chafe (1987), we distinguish three zones, i.e., activated zone (AZ), semi-activated zone (SAZ) and inactivated zone (IAZ), within the DM&apos;.

Presumably, every typical adult communicator has at his/her disposal a vast and extensive knowledge store relating to the scenes and events occurring in the world he/she is in. The contents of the store are acquired via direct perception of the environment and, less directly, communication with others or reflection upon past acquisitions. Discourse entails the employment and deployment of the knowledge store, but in a specific discourse only a subset of it deemed relevant to the on-going discourse is incurred, given the economy principle of human cognitive system (Wilkes, 1997). We refer to this subset of knowledge store (KS) in operation for and in a given discourse as discourse model (DM) and hold it as bearing directly on focus. Following Levelt (1989:114), DM is &apos;a speaker&apos;s record of what he believes to be shared knowledge about the content of the discourse as it evolved&apos; (my italics). Thus, it is a cognitive construct incorporating an interactive dimension of speaker-hearer mutual assessment; it is also an ongoing, dynamic one being constantly Though it needs to be cautioned that such a division into these six senses is more an analytic expedient than implying</context>

Similar to the case of the DM-KS relation, the boundaries between the three zones are fluid rather than fixed, as is evident in Figure 2. Armed with these machinery, we thus define focus as &apos;whatever is in the activated zone (AZ)&apos;, or, more precisely, whatever is at the top of the stack in AZ of the (speaker&apos;s version of the hearer&apos;s) DM as a result of immediately recent operations such as retrieval and updating at a given moment in the discourse (Zuo, 1999). 3. Focus determination algorithm (FDA) Apparently, this definition of focus also renders the process of focus determination fairly transparent. The postulation of DM and KS enables the decomposition and characterization of the focus determination process in an explicit and formalized manner. Discourse is thereby reducible, to a considerable extent, to the operations on the file cards, most crucially, adding, updating, locating and relocating of the cards across the three zones. In this vein, a card that is newly added to AZ (note not what is in AZ), or an item that is newly entered onto a ca</context>

Obviously a slick (and vague) &apos;idea or thought&apos; misses the point here. A look at the internal organization of the DM again suggests the answer. Corresponding to the content of the file card, four cases can be identified as to what can become the focus: (1) the discourse referent, (2) the attribute, (3) the link, and (4) the card as a whole. Note that this breakdown analysis meshes well with findings in psycholinguistic researches, for example, the possible candidates for acquiring &apos;conceptual prominence&apos; distinguished in Levelt (1989:151).
