ABSTRACT
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.980544727272727">
Lexifanis • is a Software Tool designed
and implemented by the authors to analyze
Modern Greek Language (OniloTmA&apos;). This
system assigns grammatical classes (parts
of speech) to 95-9S% of the words of a
text which is read and normalized by the
computer.
By providing the system with the
appropriate grammatical knowledge ( i.e.:
dictionaries of non-inflected words,
affixation morphology and limited surface
syntax rules ) any &amp;quot;variant&amp;quot; of Modern
Greek Language (dialect or idiom) can be
processed.
In designing the system, special con-
sideration is given to the Greek Language
morphological characteristics, primarily
to the inflection and the accentuation.
In Linguistics, Lexifanis, can assist
the generation of indexes or lemmata;
on the other hand readability or style
analysis can be performed using this
software as a basic component. In Word
Processing this software may serve as
a background to build dictionaries for
a spelling checking and error detection
package.
Through this study our research group
has set the basis in designing an
&amp;quot; expert system &amp;quot; which is intended to
&amp;quot;understand&amp;quot; and process Modern Greek
texts. Lexifanis is the first working
tool for Modern Greek Language.

In Linguistics the systematic identi-
fication of the word classes rises seve-
ral questions in regard to the morphemic
analysis. In Computational Linguistics
several research areas use fundamental
information such as the &amp;quot;word class&amp;quot; of
a given word, isolated or in its context.
In Computer Science the automatic
processing of Greek texts is based on
relevant knowledge, at the lexical level.
In an effort to present a software
tool intended to identify the grammati-
cal classes of the words we have de-
signed and implemented Lexifanis. We
have used modern greek texts as a test-
bed of our system, but Lexifanis, can
process any &amp;quot;variant&amp;quot; of modern greek,
and even ancient greek language, provided
that it is appropriately initialized.
In this paper, whenever we use the
term greek or greek language we refer to
the modern greek language (&apos;OnuoTLyn&apos;)
in its recent monotonic version (i.e. a
single accent is used, instead of three,
and there are no breathings -&apos;nvsOuaTa&apos;)

WORD CLASSES
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.873262">
We have found that morphological analy-
sis of the greek words can provide ade-
quate information for the word class
assignment. The majority of the words
in a text can be assigned a unique
( single class ). However, there exist
some words that may be assigned two &amp;quot;pos-
sible&amp;quot; classes. This ambiguity is
inherent to their morphology. On the
other hand we know that consideration of
the words in their context may dis-
ambiguate this classification, if re-
quired. In this work there is no need
to use any stem dictionary.

The fundamental information used by
Lexifanis to provide the classes of all
greek words is extracted from the affixa-
tion morphology and especially from a
morphemic suffix analysis. In this do-
main, we follow three axes of investi-
gation : the &amp;quot;Accentual Scheme&amp;quot;, the
&amp;quot;Ending&amp;quot; and the &amp;quot;Pre-ending&amp;quot; of each
word.

Accentual scheme
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998581444444444">
The &amp;quot;accentual scheme&amp;quot; of the word
reflects the position of the stress on
the word; The stress may come only on one
of the last three syllables ( law of the
three syllables ). This scheme is iden-
tified in our system by a code number.
Table 1 lists all possible schemes and
their corresponding identification codes
(IC).

fourth endings. These endings may not
necessarily coincide with the inflectio-
nal suffixes, described in the greek
grammar CTRIA,413. Consider for example
the following pair of words highlighting
the difference in the ending of the two
words. ( In this example the ending is
the inflexional suffix, as well ).

Pre-ending

<bodyText confidence="0.968799">
On the other hand, these endings re-
flect the incidental cases of morphemic
ambiguity CKOKT,853 in the inflectional
greek language. This ambiguity can be
resolved if we further penetrate to the
word to identify what we call pre-ending.
This pre-ending, in most cases, can be
easily used to disambiguate ward
classes and it yields to a unique class
assignment when the ending alone is not
sufficient. Generally, the pre-ending
does not coincide with the derivational
suffix of the word under consideration
CTPIA,41].
Let us now consider the following
example :
xdv - a-re (: you have done)
advaT - e (: death, in vocative case)
where,the consideration of the linguistic
inflectional sufixes -as and-s are com-
pletely misleading, as far as the class
assignment is concerned. You may notice
that these two words have the same pre-
ending -aT-. In this case a further
morphemic penetration in the word is
required to resolve the ambiguity CKRAU,

A detailed suffix analysis of the
highly inflected greek language CKOYP,673
CMIRA,593 indicates that there exist mor-
phemes at the end of the word which can
be used to identify the grammatical clas-
ses of the words.
The morphological analysis, presented
in this paper,is based on a right-to-left
scanning of the words. This analysis
identifies word suffixes, named hence-
The morphemes identified at this last pe-
netration may not necessarily form the
stem of these words. Our system clas-
sifies the first word as a verb and the
second as a noun.

Finally, if more ambiguities exist in
word class assignment, a consideration of
the &amp;quot;words in their context&amp;quot; may be added
to the affixation morphology. This clas-
sification technique is fruitful in
poorely inflectional languages, such as
English ECHER,803, CKRAU,813, CR08I,823.

This syntax analysis is recommended
when the task is to determine the classes
of the words in a whole text, as op-
posed to the class assignment to isola-
ted words. By this analysis we gain in-
formation from up to two words that pre-
cede or follow the word under classifica-
tion CTZAP,533. The following is a clas-
sic disambiguation example :

Dictionaries of Nan-Inflected Words
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.994289157894737">
Greek language is highly inflected.
However, due to the fact that one out of
two words of a text is a non-inflected
word we have constructed the dictionaries
of non-inflected words containing about
400 entries. In these dictionaries we
accommodated all the non inflected words,
that have no derivational suffix, of mo-
dern greek, such as particles, pronouns,
prepositions, conjunctions, homonyms,etc.
and the inflected articles.
Each word that enters Lexifanis is
first searched in these dictionaries.
If there exist an identical entry, its
class is assigned to this word. Fig. 1
lists some of the entries of these di-
ctionaries. As an example consider &amp;quot;To&amp;quot;
(:to the,it). This word can be either
&amp;quot;article with preposion&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;pronoun&amp;quot;.

Limited Syntax Analysis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.985851466666667">
When we want to analyze and classify
the words of a text as a whole, Lexifanis
examines the word under consideration in
its context. This can be accomplished by
invoking the nearly 25 Limited Surface
Syntax Rules.
This step is recommended, in case
a word, is assigned two possible classes
(double class assignment), see Table 2,
using only the affixation morphology.
This double class assignment is due to
the ambiguity inherent to the morpho-
logy of the word.

<bodyText confidence="0.999905695652174">
Lexifanis is a complete software tool
which assigns classes to isolated words
entered by the user or, alternatively, to
all the words of an input text. This sys-
tem can be useful to a variety of appli-
cations, some of which are listed below.
The modularity in its design and imple-
mentation, along with the generality of
the concepts implemented guarantee a pro-
perty to our system : it can be easily
integrated into various software systems.
The most apparent application of Lexi-
fanis is, in Lexicography, the generation
of &amp;quot;morpheme-based&amp;quot; dictionaries and the
generation of lemmata.
Lexifanis may serve as a background in
a spelling checking and error detection
package , or any &amp;quot;writers aid&amp;quot; software

Finally, Machine Translation would be
another major area of application where

TABLE 1 : &amp;quot;accentual scheme&amp;quot; of the greek words accent. schemeIC will aa,nws : will, that n6q(;) : what(?) natai : child xdon : grace aoxaixoc : archaic auvaeTu : I compose noo$,Inua : problem Notation &amp;quot;word start delimiter&amp;quot; &amp;quot;syllable&amp;quot; &amp;quot;accent&amp;quot; &amp;quot;apostroph&amp;quot; endings may not coincide with the suffixes, in the greek grammar CTRIA,413. Consider for example the following pair of words highlighting the difference in the ending of the two words. ( In this example the ending is the inflexional suffix, as well ). sxTCA ea n (: execution) NOUN exTdA ea a (: I have executed) ADJ Notice the identical accentual scheme of the above two words. Pre-ending On the other hand, these endings reflect the incidental cases of morphemic ambiguity CKOKT,853 in the inflectional greek language. This ambiguity can be resolved if we further penetrate to the to identify what we call This pre-ending, in most cases, can be easily used to disambiguate ward classes and it yields to a unique class assignment when the ending alone is not sufficient. Generally, the pre-ending not coincide with the word under consideration CTPIA,41]. Let us now consider the following example : - (: you have done) - (: death, in vocative case) where,the consideration of the linguistic inflectional sufixes -as and-s are completely misleading, as far as the class assignment is concerned. You may notice these two words have the same preending -aT-. In this case a further morphemic penetration in the word is required to resolve the ambiguity CKRAU, 813: :e le :ed :de eed eae eee V Cr LA 4. (.4 1,3 An example to illustrate the above feature is the following: xav aT s aT s VERB NOUN 6L-xai-o-a0-vn (:justice) IC=8 NOUN IC=7 ADJ Ending A detailed suffix analysis of the highly inflected greek language CKOYP,673 CMIRA,593 indicates that there exist morphemes at the end of the word which can be used to identify the grammatical classes of the words. The morphological analysis, presented in this paper,is based on a right-to-left scanning of the words. This analysis word suffixes, named hence- The morphemes identified at this last penetration may not necessarily form the of these words. Our system sifies the first word as a verb and the second as a noun. Words in their Context Finally, if more ambiguities exist in word class assignment, a consideration of the &amp;quot;words in their context&amp;quot; may be added to the affixation morphology. This classification technique is fruitful in poorely inflectional languages, such as English ECHER,803, CKRAU,813, CR08I,823. 155 This syntax analysis is recommended when the task is to determine the classes the words in a text, opto the class assignment to isolawords. this analysis we gain formation from up to two words that precede or follow the word under classification CTZAP,533. The following is a classic disambiguation example : at ovTICta etc (: the contrasts) NOUN va avTldea sts (: to contrast) VERB are identified. Efficient search is carried out using the accentual code, mentioned above. EXAMPLE: &amp;quot;Five&amp;quot; Morphological Rules : &lt;nit&apos;s&gt; noun : verb &lt;aE/doE/aToE/ : name noun noun Notation IMPLEMENTATION Dictionaries of Nan-Inflected Words Greek language is highly inflected. However, due to the fact that one out of two words of a text is a non-inflected we have constructed the words about 400 entries. In these dictionaries we accommodated all the non inflected words, that have no derivational suffix, of modern greek, such as particles, pronouns, prepositions, conjunctions, homonyms,etc. and the inflected articles. Each word that enters Lexifanis is first searched in these dictionaries. If there exist an identical entry, its class is assigned to this word. Fig. 1 lists some of the entries of these dictionaries. As an example consider &amp;quot;To&amp;quot; (:to the,it). This word can be either &amp;quot;article with preposion&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;pronoun&amp;quot;. art : art_pron : art. prep : art.prep_pron : prep_pron pron : prep : conj homonym : particle : num : adv a at Tns CTWV TO us as a&apos; uou was sittva ncloS xat nou unv va do 80o duo Toets no0 1;sto xdss Fig. 1 Part of the Dictionaries of Non-Inflected Words &amp;quot;word start delimiter&amp;quot; &amp;quot;syllable&amp;quot; &amp;quot;accent&amp;quot; &amp;quot;exlusive or&amp;quot; Limited Syntax Analysis When we want to analyze and classify the words of a text as a whole, Lexifanis examines the word under consideration in its context. This can be accomplished by the nearly 25 Surface Syntax Rules. This step is recommended, in case a word, is assigned two possible classes (double class assignment), see Table 2, using only the affixation morphology. This double class assignment is due to the ambiguity inherent to the morphology of the word. EXAMPLE: &amp;quot;Two&amp;quot; of the limited surface syntax rules : &lt;prep_pron&gt; &lt;verb&gt; =&gt; &lt;pron&gt; &lt;verb&gt; &lt;prep_pron&gt; &lt;art_pron&gt; &lt;unclass, =&gt; &lt;prep&gt; &lt;art&gt; &lt;name THE SOFTWARE SYSTEM Lexifanis is a set of structured programms implemented in two versions : * The BATCH system, assigns classes to the words of a whole text. This system performs the limited syntax, mentioned above, in addition to the morphology. * The INTERACTIVE system, assigns classes to isolated words. This system performs only the morphological analysis. Structure of Lexifanis The whole software system is designed and implemented in MODULES or PHASES, t1;.= of which is in the Morphological Analysis Morphological Analysis is performed using about 250 rules. The user may add, delete or modify anyone of these These rules contain all the formation relevant to the endings and During this phase, the flected words, mainly verbs and nouns, 156 SUFFIX ANALYSIS - This is the main of our system which activated for words not contained in dictionaries. Finite State Automata CAHO ,793 are used to represent the morphological rules. Diagram of the Figure 2. The description of each module follows. INITIALIZATION - During this phase two processes take place : * the creation of the Dictionaries of Non-Inflected Words, and * the generation of the appropriate Automata required to express the morphological rules and the surface syntax rules INPUT AND NORMALIZATION OF THE TEXT- The interactive version of the software system performs only the accentual scheme process, whereas the batch version performs this process in parallel to the input and normalization processes. Normalization or Word Recognition is the task of identifying what constitutes a word in a stream of characters. * set up dictionaries of non-inflected words * generate morphological &amp; limited surface syntax rules • input and normalize text acc.scheme word 1 search in dictionaries words feed suffix (morfological) analysis found or not perform limited surface syntax analysis no LIMITED SYNTAX ANALYSIS - The relevant information is represented by automata. 3 ... two dimentional RESULTS - This module is best fitted to the batch version of our system, but it can be used in the interactive version, as well.

Alich assigns grammatical classes to the 95-98% of the words of a given text. * A single class is assigned to 80-90% of the words of any text, 8-15% are assigned two possible classes (double class assignment),and the remaining 2-57. of the words, are left unclassified. * The variation of the above percentages is due to the difference in style of the texts being processed. A scientific writing, for example, contain fewer ambiguities than a poem. COMPUTATIONAL DETAILS Lexifanis&apos; modules are written in &amp;quot;Pascal&amp;quot; programming language. This software runs under NOS operating system on a Cyber 171 main frame computer. Topdown design and structured programming guarantee the portability of this product. The system uses about 35 Kilowords of the Cyber computer memory (60bits/word) and it requires 12 seconds &amp;quot;compilation time&amp;quot;. The batch version classifies the words at a rate of 110 word classes per second. APPLICATIONS Lexifanis is a complete software tool which assigns classes to isolated words entered by the user or, alternatively, to all the words of an input text. This system can be useful to a variety of applications, some of which are listed below. The modularity in its design and implementation, along with the generality of the concepts implemented guarantee a property to our system : it can be easily integrated into various software systems. The most apparent application of Lexifanis is, in Lexicography, the generation of &amp;quot;morpheme-based&amp;quot; dictionaries and the generation of lemmata. Lexifanis may serve as a background in a spelling checking and error detection package , or any &amp;quot;writers aid&amp;quot; software system. Finally, Machine Translation would be another major area of application where Lexifanis may be included, as a module or process, in an &amp;quot;expert system&amp;quot;. EPILOGUE ... we have presented a software tool, This system performs suffix analysis to assign classes to all the greek words. For the first time accentual scheme has been proved useful in the classification of greek words. Moreover, ambiguities inherent to the suffix morphology of greek words can be resolved without any stem dictionary ...</abstract>
