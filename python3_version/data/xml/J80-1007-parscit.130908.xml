Results of the 1978 Publications Survey
</note>
<bodyText confidence="0.99747872368421">
Prior to this issue, since its inception in 1974, the
American Journal of Computational Linguistics had
been published exclusively in microfiche form (with
opaque index cards), consisting of pages reproduced
directly from authors&apos; typewritten manuscripts. In July
of 1978 a proposal was made for publishing the Jour-
nal primarily in a phototypeset, hard-copy form at a
cost that was only slightly higher than the microfiche
form and well within the ACL&apos;s financial means, with-
out requiring a dues increase. Based on this proposal,
a survey of the entire individual membership of the
ACL was conducted to determine people&apos;s preferences
for the form of publication of the AJCL. Over 500
questionnaires were sent out, and over 200 responses
were received within the first couple of weeks. About
80% of these respondents indicated a preference for a
primarily hard-copy form of publication.
Based on these results, the ACL Executive Com-
mittee decided at the 1978 Annual Meeting to begin
publishing the AJCL in this new form with the first
issue of 1979. (As it turned out, however, technical
and other difficulties associated with producing the
first issue caused several delays, eventually resulting in
the decision to skip publication in 1979 altogether and
start the new form with this first issue of 1980.)
The new form. In its new form, each quarterly
issue of the AJCL will contain about 50 pages, at least
half of which will be devoted to technical articles. The
rest of the issue will consist of book reviews, an-
nouncements, news items, information on programs
and courses in computational linguistics, descriptions
of research projects and of resources relevant for re-
search, and the comprehensive current bibliography
with abstracts of publications and reports in the field.
The amount of material published will be substantially
the same as that included in previous years on multiple
microfiches, in spite of the smaller number of actual
pages, because the new format will accommodate more
information in less space.
Included with each issue of the AJCL will be a
single 4-by-6-inch microfiche containing the same
material as the printed version, one journal page per
frame. However, since the microfiche can accommo-
date up to 98 pages, it will be possible to include addi-
tional material, such as appendices for technical arti-
cles, program listings, and the membership roster. An
index card will summarize the contents of the micro-
fiche, so that this form will be appropriate for inde-
pendent archival use.
The survey materials. The cover letter and the
questionnaire from the 1978 survey are reproduced in
their entirety on pages 68-70 in the microfiche supple-
ment to this issue. (Incidentally, this furnishes a good
example of the kind of material that this supplement
can be used for.) The two-page cover letter is a de-
tailed presentation of the proposal for hard-copy publi-
cation, with its feasibility supported by facts and fig-
ures. The one-page questionnaire gives nine publica-
tion alternatives, ranging from all microfiche to all
hard copy, which the respondent was asked to rank
using the numbers 1 through 9; there are also four
questions to directly solicit the respondent&apos;s feelings
about hard copy versus microfiche.
Results. Of the 513 questionnaires sent out (383 to
the U.S., 40 to Canada, and 90 to other countries),
212 responses were received prior to the meeting at
which the decision was made (169 from the U.S., 21
from Canada, and 22 from other countries). The table
below shows, for each of the nine alternatives, the
percentage of the 212 respondents who ranked that
alternative as number 1 (i.e. their first choice). It also
shows the average rank computed for each alternative
and the resulting order of preference for the nine al-
ternatives. (In the brief descriptions of the alterna-
tives, HC stands for hard copy, and MF stands for
microfiche.)

It can be seen that 78% of the respondents select-
ed either alternative 6, 7 or 8 as their first choice and
also that those alternatives were the first three in order
of preference. Each of these was just a variation on
the basic theme of a primarily hard-copy journal as
proposed in the cover letter. Although alternative 7
actually had the most support, the decision was made
to implement alternative 6, which provides each mem-
ber with both hard copy and microfiche, because it
provides more flexibility of publication, while still al-
lowing those people who preferred 7 or 8 to have what
they want, simply by discarding one form or the other
when they receive it.

The following table summarizes the responses to
the four questions included in the survey. Here, too, it
can be seen that respondents were very positive to the
idea of a primarily hard-copy publication.

The responses were also tabulated separately for the
U.S., Canada, and the other countries, but the results
did not differ significantly from the combined results
shown. About 35 additional responses were received
after the meeting, but it was apparent from looking at
them carefully that they would not significantly affect
the results already tabulated.

The 17th Annual Meeting of the Association for
Computational Linguistics was held at the University
of California at San Diego, in La Jolla, California, on
the weekend of August 11-12, 1979. The program
committee for the meeting consisted of Norm Sond-
heimer (Chairman), Barbara Sangster, Bonnie Lynn
Webber, and Ralph Weischedel, and the local arrange-
ments chairman was Jim Levin. The 24 papers listed
below were presented there. Copies of the proceed-
