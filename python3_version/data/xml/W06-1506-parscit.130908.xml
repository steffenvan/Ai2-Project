In relative clauses, the wh relative pro-
noun can be embedded in a larger phrase,
as in a boy [whose brother] Mary hit.
In such examples, we say that the larger
phrase has pied-piped along with the wh-
word. In this paper, using a similar syntac-
tic analysis for wh pied-piping as in Han
(2002) and further developed in Kallmeyer
and Schefier (2004), I propose a composi-
tional semantics for relative clauses based
on Synchronous Tree Adjoining Gram-
mar. It will be shown that (i) the elemen-
tary tree representing the logical form of
a wh-word provides a generalized quanti-
fier, and (ii) the semantic composition of
the pied-piped material and the wh-word is
achieved through adjoining in the seman-
tics of the former onto the latter.

such examples, we say that the larger phrase con-
taining the wh-word has PIED-PIPED along with

In this paper, using a similar syntactic analysis for
wh pied-piping as in Han (2002) and further devel-
oped in Kallmeyer and Schefier (2004), I propose
a compositional semantics for relative clauses of
the sort illustrated in (1) and (2), based on Syn-
chronous Tree Adjoining Grammar (STAG). The
two main components of my proposal are that (i)
the semantic tree representing the logical form of a
wh relative pronoun provides a generalized quan-
tifier, and (ii) the semantic composition of the
pied-piped material and the wh-word is achieved
through adjoining of the former onto the latter in
the semantics. Although TAG semantics for rel-
ative clauses based on iat semantics have been
proposed before (Han, 2002; Kallmeyer, 2003), no
STAG-based analysis exists, as far as I know.
In section 2, I introduce the framework of
STAG and STAG-based compositional semantics
and clarify my assumptions. In section 3, I present
my analysis of relative clauses and pied-piping. I
extend the proposed analysis to relative clauses in
which wh-word is in a PP and those in which no
pied-piping has taken place in section 4.

I use STAG as defined in Shieber (1994). In an
STAG, each syntactic elementary tree is paired
with one or more semantic trees that represent its
logical form with links between matching nodes.
A synchronous derivation proceeds by mapping a
derivation tree from the syntax side to an isomor-
phic derivation tree in the semantics side, and is
synchronized by the links specified in the elemen-
tary tree pairs. In the tree pairs given in Figure 1,
the trees in the left side are syntactic elementary
trees and the ones in the right side are semantic
trees. In the semantic trees, F stands for formulas,
R for predicates and T for terms. I assume that
these nodes are typed and I represent predicates
as unreduced λ-expressions. The linked nodes are
shown with boxed numbers. For sake of simplic-
ity, in the elementary tree pairs, I only include
links that are relevant for the derivation of given
examples.

form of (3). All the syntactic elementary trees sat-
isfy Frank’s (2002) Condition on Elementary Tree
Minimality (CETM), which states that “the syn-
tactic heads in an elementary tree and their projec-
tions must form an extended projection of a sin-
gle lexical head” (Frank 2002, p. 54). Particu-
larly, (αa movie) is a valid elementary tree, as a
noun can form an extended projection with a DP,
in line with the DP Hypothesis. The proper name
tree in (αJohn) is paired with a tree representing
a term in the semantics, and the attributive adjec-
tive tree in (βgood) is paired with an auxiliary tree
in the semantics that represents a one-place predi-
cate to be adjoined to another one-place predicate.
As for the syntax-semantics pairing of elementary
trees for quantified DPs, I follow Shieber and Sch-
abes (1990), and use Tree Local Multi-Component
TAG (as defined in Weir (1988)) in the seman-
tics. Thus, the DP in (αa movie) is paired with a
multi-component set {(α0a movie), (β0a movie)}
in the semantics: (α0a movie) provides an argu-
ment variable, and (β0a movie) provides the ex-
istential quantifier with the restriction and scope.
The transitive tree in (αsaw) is paired with a se-
mantic tree representing a formula that consists of
a two-place predicate and two term nodes. The
links, shown with boxed numbers, guarantee that
whatever substitutes into DPi, the corresponding
semantic tree will substitute into the term node
marked with 1 , and whatever substitutes into DP
is paired up with a multi-component set in the se-
mantics where one of the components will substi-
tute into the term node marked with 2 and the
other will adjoin onto the F node marked with
2 . The syntactic and semantic derivation trees
are given in Figure 2, and the derived trees are
given in Figure 3. I leave out the tree addresses
in the semantic derivation tree, as these are deter-
mined by the links between the syntactic and se-
mantic elementary trees.1

The semantic derived trees can be reduced by
applying λ-conversion, as the nodes dominate
typed λ-expressions and terms. When reducing se-
mantic derived trees, in addition to λ-conversion, I
propose to use Predicate Modification, as defined
in Heim and Kratzer (1998) in (4).

I propose the elementary tree pairs in Figure 4
for the syntactic derivation and semantic compo-
sition of the relative clause in (1). In the syntax
side, (αwho) substitutes into DPS in (βhit), and the
pied-piping of the rest of the DP is achieved by ad-
joining (β’s brother) onto (αwho). The tree in (β’s
brother) is a widely-accepted genitive structure ac-
cording to the DP hypothesis, where the genitive ’s
heads the DP tree. This satisfies CETM, as a DP
is an extended projection of a noun. Substituting
(αmary) into DPZ in (βhit) completes the deriva-
tion of the relative clause.

Semantically, we must make sure that the vari-
able coming from the wh-word is also the one be-
ing predicated of the head noun (boy in (1)), and
yet the same variable does not serve as an argu-
ment of the predicate (hit in (1)) in the relative
clause. I argue that the introduction of a gener-
alized quantifier (GQ) node in the semantic tree in
(β0who) and adjoining of (β0’s brother) onto the
GQ node guarantee this. I define the logical form
of a wh relative pronoun as an auxiliary tree given
in (β0who). In (β0who), λx binds x in the gen-
eralized quantifier, λP.P(x). Adjoining (β0who)
onto the relative clause elementary tree in (β0hit)
essentially has the effect of abstracting over the
variable coming from the wh-word in the relative
clause, turning it into a one-place predicate. This
therefore ensures that the relative clause and the
head noun are predicating over the same variable,
deriving the interpretation of the relative clause
as a modifier of the head noun. The meaning of
the pied-piped material ’s brother is added onto
the meaning of who by adjoining the auxiliary
tree defined in (β0’s brother) onto the GQ node
in (β0who). In (β0’s brother), λy ensures that the
variable coming from the DP* (who) is in some
relation with the variable coming from the head
of the pied-piped DP (whose brother), and λQ, by
turning whose brother into a GQ, ensures that the
variable coming from the head of the pied-piped
DP is the argument of the predicate that the DP
combines with. The derivation tree and the de-
rived tree in the semantics side are given in (δ01)
in Figure 5 and (γ01) in Figure 6. After all the λ-
conversions have applied, (γ01) can be reduced to
the expression in (6).

The expression in (6) is a one-place predicate
which can be paraphrased as a set of all x’s such
that there is a unique brother z and x is in some
relation with z and Mary hit z. As the seman-
tics of relative clauses is defined to be a one-place
predicate, it is analogous to attributive adjectives.
This means that the semantic tree resulting from

The proposed syntax and the semantics of pied-
piping can straightforwardly be extended to cases
in which the wh-word is embedded in a PP, as in
(11).
(11) a boy [ [DP the brother of whom]i Mary hit
ti ]
For the derivation of (11), we need to change two
of the elementary tree pairs in Figure 4 slightly.
The elementary tree pairs &lt;(αwho), (β0who)&gt;
and &lt;(β’s brother), β0’s brother)&gt; need to be re-
placed with the pairs in Figure 10. Since the rel-
ative pronoun in (11) is whom, we use a DP tree
anchoring whom in (αwhom). The corresponding
semantic tree (β0whom) remains exactly the same
as before. (βthe brother of) represents the pied-
piped material in DP. It is a well-formed elemen-
tary tree according to CETM as it has a single lexi-
cal head brother and DP is an extended projection
of this head, and PP is not subject to CETM be-
cause P is a functional head, not a lexical head.
Moreover, DP* is licensed as it is an argument
of the lexical head brother, as argued in Kroch
(1989). The semantics of the brother of whom is
equivalent to whose brother, and therefore, we pair
up (βthe brother of) with the exact same semantic
tree as (β0’s brother).
The derivation trees for the relative clause in
(11) are given in Figure 11. They look exactly the
same as the ones for the relative clause in (1), ex-
cept for names of the elementary trees in a few
nodes. The derived trees are given in Figure 12.
While the syntactic derived tree (γ11) is different
from (γ1) in Figure 6 in the structure of DP con-
taining the pied-piped material, the semantic de-
rived tree (γ011) looks exactly the same as (γ01)
in Figure 6. This is as it should be given that the
meaning of (1) and the meaning of (11) are equiv-
alent.

The proposed analysis can also be extended to
relative clauses in which no pied-piping has taken
place. When the larger DP containing the relative
pronoun is indefinite or non-specific, the DP can
be stranded, as in (12). This gives us a configura-
tion where a wh-word has extracted out of a DP.
(12) a boy [whomi Mary hit [DP a brother of ti]]
Since we now have a DP with an indefinite
article, a tree pair in Figure 13 is needed, for
the derivation of (12). Using the semantic tree
(β0a brother of), the semantic composition of the
relative clause in (12) can proceed as before: the
semantic tree (β0a brother of) adjoins onto the se-
mantic tree (β0whom) in Figure 10, which then
adjoins onto (β0hit) in Figure 4. In the syntax,
however, we must make sure that (βa brother of)
does not adjoin onto the relative pronoun whom,
because if it did, we would end up with the string
a brother of whom. Instead, what we need is
for (βa brother of) to adjoin onto the DP domi-
nating the trace of the extracted object in (βhit).
This however is not a valid derivation in STAG,
as elementary trees in a single pair are composing
with two trees from two different pairs. A slight
modification in the syntactic elementary tree for
(αwhom) in Figure 14 can fix this problem. I pro-
pose to do this by turning (αwhom) into a multi-
component set {(αwhom), (βwhom)} as in Fig-
ure 14. An auxiliary tree like (βwhom), which
does not dominate any other nodes, is a degenerate
tree, and has been used in Kroch (1989) and Frank
(2002) to handle extraction from a wh-island, as in
[Which car]i does Sally wonder how to fix ti?
In syntax, to derive the relative clause in (12),
(αwhom) substitutes into DPj in (βhit) as be-
fore, and (βwhom) adjoins onto the DP domi-
nating the trace of the extracted object in (βhit),
as shown in the derivation tree (δ12) in Figure
15. And in semantics, (β0whom) adjoins onto
(β0hit) as before, as shown in (δ012) in Figure
15. Subsequently, in syntax (βa brother of) ad-
joins onto (βwhom) giving us the DP a brother of
tj, and in semantics (β0a brother of) adjoins onto
(β0whom). Thus, by using the multi-component
set {(αwhom), (βwhom)}, we now have a situ-
ation where two elementary trees in a single pair
are composing with two trees belonging to another
pair. The syntactic and the semantic derived trees
are given in Figure 16. After λ-conversions, (γ012)
can be reduced to the expression in (13).2

possible using examples in which the wh-word
is embedded in a genitive DP, and shown that
the proposed analysis can straightforwardly be ex-
tended to cases in which the wh-word is embed-
ded in a PP. The main ingredients of the proposed
analysis are: in syntax, the pied-piped material ad-
joins to the wh-word, and in semantics, the wh-
word provides a GQ to which the meaning of the
pied-piped material adjoins. I have also shown
that similar analysis can handle cases in which the
wh-word alone has moved to [Spec,CP], strand-
ing the rest of the DP in situ, if we use a multi-
component set containing a degenerate DP for the
syntax of the relative pronoun. The proposed anal-
ysis utilizes composition operations in semantics
that are already available in syntax, substitution
and adjoining, thereby making syntax-semantics
mapping in TAG simple and straightforward.

Since the relative pronoun in (11) is whom, we use a DP tree anchoring whom in (αwhom). The corresponding semantic tree (β0whom) remains exactly the same as before. (βthe brother of) represents the piedpiped material in DP. It is a well-formed elementary tree according to CETM as it has a single lexical head brother and DP is an extended projection of this head, and PP is not subject to CETM because P is a functional head, not a lexical head. Moreover, DP* is licensed as it is an argument of the lexical head brother, as argued in Kroch (1989). The semantics of the brother of whom is equivalent to whose brother, and therefore, we pair up (βthe brother of) with the exact same semantic tree as (β0’s brother). The derivation trees for the relative clause in (11) are given in Figure 11. They look exactly the same as the ones for the relative clause in (1), except for names of the elementary trees in a few nodes. The derived trees are given in Figure 12.

In an STAG, each syntactic elementary tree is paired with one or more semantic trees that represent its logical form with links between matching nodes. A synchronous derivation proceeds by mapping a derivation tree from the syntax side to an isomorphic derivation tree in the semantics side, and is synchronized by the links specified in the elementary tree pairs. In the tree pairs given in Figure 1, the trees in the left side are syntactic elementary trees and the ones in the right side are semantic trees.

The links, shown with boxed numbers, guarantee that whatever substitutes into DPi, the corresponding semantic tree will substitute into the term node marked with 1 , and whatever substitutes into DP is</context>
