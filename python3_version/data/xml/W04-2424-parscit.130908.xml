The meaning of a sentence is an essential aspect of
natural language understanding, yet an elusive one,
since there is no accepted methodology for determin-
ing it. There is not even a consensus on criteria for
distinguishing word senses. Clearly a more robust
technology is needed that uses data-driven techniques.
These techniques typically rely on supervised machine
learning, so a critical goal is the definition of a level of
semantic representation (sense tags and semantic role
labels) that could be consistently annotated on a large
scale. We have been training automatic WSD systems
on the English sense-tagged training data based on
WordNet that we supplied to SENSEVAL2 (Dang &amp;
Palmer, 2002). A pervasive problem with sense tag-
ging is finding a sense inventory with clear criteria for
sense distinctions. WordNet is often criticized for its
subtle and fine-grained sense distinctions. Perhaps
more consistent and coarse-grained sense distinctions
would be more suitable for natural language process-
ing applications. Grouping the highly polysemous
verb senses in WordNet (on average reducing the &gt;16
senses per verb to 8) provides an important first step a
more flexible granularity for WordNet senses that im-
proves both inter-annotator agreement (71% to 82%)
and system performance (60.2% to 69%) (Dang &amp;
Palmer, 2002). The Frameset sense tags associated
with the PropBank, as discussed below, provide an
even more coarse-grained and easily replicable level
of sense distinctions.
Based on a consensus of colleagues participating in the
ACE (Automatic Content Extraction) program, we
have developed a Proposition Bank, or PropBank,
which provides semantic role labels for verbs and par-
ticipial modifiers for the 1M word Penn Treebank II
corpus (Marcus, 1994). VerbNet classes have proved
invaluable for defining the appropriate semantic roles
in this endeavor (Dang, et. al., 1998). For example,
John is the Agent or Arg0 of John broke the window,
IBM is the Theme or Arg1 of IBM rose 1.2 points. In
addition, for just over 700 of the most polysemous
verbs in the Penn TreeBank, we have defined two or
more Framesets – major sense distinctions based on
differing sets of semantic roles (Palmer, et al, submit-
ted). These Framesets overlap closely (95%) with our
manual groupings of the SENSEVAL2 verb senses,
and thus they can be combined to provide an hierarchi-
cal set of sense distinctions. The PropBank is complete
and a beta-release version was made publicly available
through LDC in February for use in the CoNLL-04
shared task. There is a complementary lexicography
project at Berkeley, Chuck Fillmore’s FRAMENET,
which provides representative annotated samples rather
than broad-coverage annotation, and there are current
plans to combine these resources and train automatic
labelers for English and Chinese. The automatic se-
mantic role labelers we are building use features that
are very similar to our WSD system features, and we
find that semantic role label features improve WSD
while sense tag features improve semantic role labeling
(Gildea &amp; Palmer, 2002).
