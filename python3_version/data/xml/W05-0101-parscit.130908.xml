In Fall 2004 I introduced a new course
called Applied Natural Language Process-
ing, in which students acquire an under-
standing of which text analysis techniques
are currently feasible for practical appli-
cations. The class was intended for in-
terdisciplinary students with a somewhat
technical background. This paper de-

gramming exercises, emphasizing which
aspects were successful and which prob-

In Fall 2005 I introduced a new graduate level course
called Applied Natural Language Processing.&apos; The
goal of this course was to acquaint students with the
state-of-the-art of the field of NLP with an empha-
sis on applications. The intention was for students
to leave the class with an understanding of what is
currently feasible (and just on the horizon) to ex-
pect from content analysis, and how to use and ex-
tend existing NLP tools and technology. The course
did not emphasize the theoretical underpinnings of
NLP, although we did cover the most important al-
gorithms. A companion graduate course on Statis-
tical NLP was taught by Dan Klein in the Com-
puter Science department. Dan’s course focused on

puter science students took both courses, and thus
learned both the theoretical and the applied sides of
NLP. Dan and I discussed the goals and content of
our respective courses in advance, but developed the
courses independently.

2 Course Role within the SIMS Program
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999829307692308">
The primary target audience of the Applied NLP
course were masters students, and to a lesser ex-
tent, PhD students, in the School of Information
Management and Systems. (Nevertheless, PhD stu-
dents in computer science and other fields also took
the course.) MIMS students (as the SIMS mas-
ters students are known) pursue a professional de-
gree studying information at the intersection of tech-
nology and social sciences. The students’ techni-
cal backgrounds vary widely; each year a signifi-
cant fraction have Computer Science undergraduate
degrees, and another significant fraction have so-
cial science or humanities backgrounds. All stu-
dents have an interest in technology and are re-
quired to take some challenging technical courses,
but most non-CS background students are uncom-
fortable with advanced mathematics and are not as
comfortable with coding as CS students are.
A key aspect of the program is the capstone fi-
nal project, completed in the last semester, that (ide-
ally) combines knowledge and skills obtained from
throughout the program. Most students form a team
of 3-4 students and build a system, usually to meet
the requirements of an outside client or customer
(although some students write policy papers and
others get involved in research with faculty mem-

bers). Often the execution of these projects makes
use of user-centered design, including a needs as-
sessment, and iterative design and testing of the arti-
fact. These projects often also have a backend de-
sign component using database design principles,
document engineering modeling, or information ar-
chitecture and organization principles, with sensitiv-
ity to legal considerations for privacy and intellec-
tual property. Students are required to present their
work to an audience of students, faculty, and pro-
fessionals, produce a written report, and produce a
website that describes and demonstrates their work.
In many cases these projects would benefit greatly
from content analysis. Past projects have included
a system to query on and monitor news topics as
they occur across time and sources, a system to ana-
lyze when and where company names are mentioned
in text and graph interconnections among them, a
system to allow customization of news channels by
topic, and systems to search and analyze blogs. Our
past course offerings in this space focused on infor-
mation retrieval with very little emphasis on content
analysis, so students were using only IR-type tech-
niques for these projects.
The state of the art in NLP had advanced suffi-
ciently that the available tools can be employed for a
number of projects like these. Furthermore, it is im-
portant for students attempting such projects to have
an understanding of what is currently feasible and
what is too ambitious. In fact, I find that this is a key
aspect of teaching an applied class: learning what
is possible with existing tools, what is feasible but
requires more expertise than can be engineered in a
semester with existing tools, and what is beyond the
scope of current techniques.

3 Choosing Tools and Readings
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999984896551724">
The main challenges for a hands-on course as I’d
envisioned surrounded finding usable interoperable
tools, and defining feasible assignments that make
use of programming without letting it interfere with
learning.
There is of course the inevitable decision of which
programming language(s) to work with. Scripting
tools such as python are fast and easy to prototype
with, but require the students to learn a new pro-
gramming language. Java is attractive because many
tools are written in it and the MIMS students were
familiar with java – they are required to use it for
two of their required courses but still tend to strug-
gle with it. I did not consider perl since python is a
more principled language and is growing in accep-
tance and in tool availability.
In the end I decided to require the students to learn
python because I wanted to use NLTK, the Natural
Language Toolkit (Loper and Bird, 2002). One goal
of NLTK is to remove the emphasis on programming
to enable students to achieve results quickly; and
this aligned with my primary goal. NLTK seemed
promising because it contained some well-written
tutorials on n-grams, POS tagging and chunking,
and contained text categorization modules. (I also
wanted support for entity extraction, which NLTK
does not supply.) NLTK is written in python, and
so I decided to try it and have the students learn a
new programming language. As will be described in
detail below, our use of NLTK was somewhat suc-
cessful, but we experienced numerous problems as
well.
I made a rather large mistake early on by not
spending time introducing python, since I wanted
the assignments to correspond to the lectures and did
not want to spend lecture time on the programming
language itself. I instructed students who had regis-
tered for the course to learn python during the sum-
mer, but (not surprisingly) many of did not and had
to struggle in the first few weeks. In retrospect, I re-
alize I should have allowed time for people to learn
python, perhaps via a lab session that met only dur-
ing the first few weeks of class.
Another sticking point was student exposure to
regular expressions. Regex’s were very important
and useful practical tools both for tokenization as-
signments and for shallow parsing. I assumed that
the MIMS students had gotten practice with regu-
lar expressions because they are required to take a
computer concepts foundations course which I de-
signed several years ago. Unfortunately, the lecturer
who took over the class from me had decided to
omit regex’s and related topics. I realized that I had
to do some remedial coverage of the topic, which
of course bored the CS students and which was not
complete enough for the MIMS students. Again this
suggests that perhaps some kind of lab is needed for
getting people caught up in topics, or that perhaps

the first few weeks of the class should be optional
for more advanced students.
I was also unable to find an appropriate textbook.
Neither Sch¨utze &amp; Manning nor Jurafsky &amp; Mar-
tin focus on the right topics. The closest in terms
of topic is Natural Language Processing for Online
Applications by Peter Jackson &amp; Isabelle Moulinier,
but much of this book focuses on Information Re-
trieval (which we teach in two other courses) and did
not go into depth on the topics I most cared about.
Instead of a text, students read a small selection of
research papers and the NLTK tutorials.

Note the lack of coverage of full syntactic parsing,
which is covered extensively in Dan Klein’s course.
I touched on it briefly in the second shallow pars-
ing lecture and felt this level of coverage was ac-
ceptable because shallow parsing is often as useful
if not more so than full parsing for most applica-
tions. Note also the lack of coverage of word sense
disambiguation. This topic is rich in algorithms, but
was omitted primarily due to time constraints, but in
part because of the lack of well-known applications.
Based on the kinds of capstone projects the MIMS
students have done in the past, I knew that the most
important techniques for their needs surrounded
text categorization and information extraction/entity
recognition. There are terrific software resources for
text categorization and the field is fairly mature, so
I had my PhD students Preslav Nakov and Barbara
Rosario gave the lectures on this topic, in order to
provide them with teaching experience.
The functionality provided by named entity
recognition is very important for a wide range of
real-world applications. Unfortunately, none of the
free tools that we tried were particularly successful.
Those that are available are difficult to configure and
get running in a short amount of time, and have vir-
tually no documentation. Furthermore, the state-of-
the-art in algorithms is not present in the available
tools in the way that more mature technologies such
as POS tagging, parsing, and categorization are.

We used the latest version of NLTK, which at the
time was version 1.4.2 NLTK supplies some pre-
processed text collections, which are quite useful.
(Unfortunately, the different corpora have different
types of preprocessing applied to them, which of-
ten lead to confusion and extra work for the class.)
The NLTK tokenizer, POS taggers and the shallow
parser (chunker) have terrific functionality once they
are understood; some students were able to get quite
accurate results using these and the supplied train-
ing sets. The ability to combine different n-gram
taggers within the structure of a backoff tagger also
supported an excellent exercise. However, a some-
what minor problem with the taggers is that there is
no compact way to store the model resulting from
tagging for later use. A serialized object could be
created and stored, but the size of such object was
so large that it takes about as long to load it into
memory as it does to retrain the tagger.

I should have done a longer unit on this topic, at the
expense of boring the CS students.
The students learned a great deal from working to
improve the grammar rules, but the verb-argument
analysis portion was not particularly successful, in
part because the corpus analyzed was too small to
yield many sentences for a given verb and because
we did not have code to automatically find regu-

verbs. Other causes of difficulty were the students’
lack of linguistic background, and the fact that the

students little time for the analysis portion of the as-

6.1 Text Categorization Assignment
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997635">
As mentioned above, text categorization is useful for
a wide range SIMS applications, and we made it a
centerpiece of the course. Unfortunately, we had to
make a mid-course correction when I suddenly real-
ized that text categorization was no longer available
in NLTK.
After looking at a number of tools, we decided
to use the Weka toolkit for categorization (Witten
and Frank, 2000). We did not want the students to
feel they had wasted their time learning python and
NLTK, so we decided to make it easy for the stu-
dents to reuse their python code by providing an in-
terface between it and Weka.
My PhD student Preslav Nakov provided great
help by writing code to translate the output of our
python code into the input format expected by Weka.
(Weka is written in java but has command line and
GUI interfaces, and can read in input files and store
models as output files.) As time went on we added
increasingly more functionality to this code, tying it
in with the NLTK modules so that the students could
use the NLTK corpora for training and testing.3

</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.998763911111111">
Both Preslav and I had used Weka in the past but
mainly with the command-line interface, and not
taking advantage of its rich functionality. As with
NLTK, the documentation for Weka was incomplete
and out of date, and it was difficult to determine how
to use the more advanced features. We performed
extended experimentation with the system and de-
veloped a detailed tutorial on how to use the system;
this tutorial should be of general use.4
For the categorization task, we used the “twenty
newsgroups” collection that was supplied with
NLTK. Unfortunately, it was not preprocessed into
sentences, so I also had to write some sentence split-
ting code (based on Palmer and Hearst (1997)) so
students could make use of their tokenizer and tag-
ger code.
We selected one pair of newsgroups which con-
tained very different content (rec.motorcycles
vs. sci.space). We called this the diverse
set. We then created two groups of news-
groups with more homogeneous content (a)
rec.autos, rec.motorcycles, rec.sport.baseball,
rec.sport.hockey, and (b) sci.crypt, sci.electronics,
sci.med.original, sci.space. The intention was to
show the students that it is easier to automatically
distinguish the heterogeneous groups than the
homogeneous ones.
We set up the code to allow students to adjust the
size of their training and development sets, and to
separate out a reserved test set that would be used
for comparing students’ solutions.
We challenged the students to get the best scores
possible on the held out test set, telling them not to
use this test set until they were completely finished
training and testing on the development set. (We re-
lied on the honor system for this.) We made it known
that we would announce which were the top-scoring
assignments. As a general rule I avoid competition
in my classes, but this was kept very low-key; only
the top-scoring results would be named. Further-
more, innovative approaches that perhaps did not do
as well as some others were also highlighted. Stu-
dents were required to try at least 2 different types
of features and 3 different classifiers.

dents were creative about building their features,
and it was possible to achieve very strong results
(much stronger than I expected) on both sets of
newsgroups. The best scoring approaches got 99%
accuracy on the 2-way diverse distinction and 97%
accuracy on the 4-way homogeneous distinction.

6.2 Enron Email Assignment
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999979815789474">
Many of the SIMS students are interested in social
networking and related topics. I decided as part of
the class that we would analyze a relatively new text
collection that had become available and that con-
tained the potential for interesting text mining and
analysis. I was also interested in having the class
help produce a resource that would be of use to other
classes and researchers. Thus we decided to take on
the Enron email corpus,5 on which limited analysis
had been done.
My PhD student Andrew Fiore wrote code to pre-
process this text, removing redundancies, normal-
izing email addresses, labeling quoted text, and so
on. He and I designed a database schema for repre-
senting much of the structure of the collection and
loaded in the parsed text. I created a Lucene6 in-
dex for doing free text queries while Andrew built a
highly functional web interface for searching fielded
components. Andrew’s system eventually allowed
for individual students to login and register annota-
tions on the email messages.
This collection consists of approximately 200,000
messages after the duplicates have been removed.
We wanted to identify a subset of emails that might
be interesting for analysis while at the same time
avoiding highly personal messages, messages con-
sisting mainly of jokes, and so on. After doing nu-
merous searches, we decided to try to focus primar-
ily on documents relating to the California energy
crisis, trading discrepancies, and messages occur-
ring near the end of the time range (just before the
company’s stock crashed).
After selecting about 1500 messages, I devised an
initial set of categories. In class we refined these.
One student had the interesting idea of trying to
identify change in emotional tone as the scandals
surrounding the company came to light, so we added
emotional tone as a category type. Each message

<bodyText confidence="0.999917533333333">
was then read and annotated by two students using
the pre-defined categories. Students were asked to
reconcile their differences when they had them.
Despite these safeguards, my impression is that
the resulting assignments are far from consistent and
the categories themselves are still rather ad hoc and
oftentimes overlapping. There were many difficult
curation issues, such as how to categorize a message
with forwarded content when that content differed
in kind from the new material. If we’d spent more
time on this we could have done a better job, but as
this was not an information organization course, I
felt we could not spend more time on perfecting the
labels. Thus, I do not recommend the category la-
bels be used for serious analysis. Nevertheless, a
number of researchers have asked for the cleaned
up database and categories, and we have made them
publicly available, along with the search interface.7
The students were then given two weeks to pro-
cess the collection in some manner. I made sev-
eral suggestions, including trying to automatically
assign the hand-assigned categories, extending some
automatic acronym recognition work that we’d done
in our research (Schwartz and Hearst, 2003), using
named entity recognition code to identify various ac-
tors, clustering the collection, or doing some kind of
social network analysis. Students were told that they
could extend this assignment into their final projects
if they chose.
For most students it was difficult to obtain a strong
result using this collection. The significant excep-
tion was for those students who worked on ex-
tending our acronym recognition algorithm; these
projects were quite successful. (In fact, one student
managed to improve on our results with a rather sim-
ple modification to our code.) Students often had
creative ideas that were stymied by the poor quality
of the available tools. Two groups used the MAL-
LET named entity recognizer toolkit8 in order to do
various kinds of social network analysis, but the re-
sults were poor. (Students managed to make up for
this deficiency in creative ways.)
I was a bit worried about students trying to use
clustering to analyze the results, given the general
difficulty of making sense of the results of cluster-

ing, and this concern was justified. Clustering based
on Weka and other tools is of course memory- and
compute-intensive, but more problematically, the re-
sults are difficult to interpret. I would recommend
against allowing students to do a text clustering exer-
cise unless within a more constrained environment.
In summary, students were excited about build-
ing a resource based on relatively untapped and very
interesting data. The resulting analysis on this un-
tamed text was somewhat disappointing, but given
that only two weeks were spent on this part of the
assignment, I believe it was a good learning experi-
ence. Furthermore, the resulting resource seems to
be of interest to a number of researchers, as was our
intention.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.951782">
6.3 Final Projects
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999988264705882">
I deliberately kept the time for the final projects
short (about 3 weeks) so students would not go over-
board or feel pressure to do something hugely time-
consuming. The goal was to allow students to tie
together some of the different ideas and skills they’d
acquired in the class (and elsewhere), and to learn
them in more depth by applying them to a topic of
personal interest.
Students were encouraged to work in pairs, and
I suggested a list of project ideas. Students who
adopted suggested projects tended to be more suc-
cessful than those who developed their own. Those
who tried other topics were often too ambitious and
had trouble getting meaningful results. However,
several of those students were trying ideas that they
planned to apply to their capstone projects, and so
it was highly valuable for them to get a preview of
what worked and what did not.
One suggestion I made was to create a back-of-
the-book indexer, specifically for a recipe book, and
one team did a good job with this project. Another
was to improve on or apply an automatic hierarchy
generation tool that we have developed in our re-
search (Stoica and Hearst, 2004). Students working
on a project to collect metadata for camera phone
images successfully applied this tool to this prob-
lem. Again, social networking analysis topics were
popular but not particularly successful; NLP tools
are not advanced enough yet to meet the needs of
this intriguing topic area. Not surprisingly, when
students started with a new (interesting) text collec-
tion, they were bogged down in the preprocessing
stage before they could get much interesting work
done.

Although students were excited about the Enron col-
lection and we created a resource that is actively be-
ing used by other researchers, I think in future ver-
sions of the class I will omit this kind of assignment
and have the students start their final projects sooner.
This will allow them time to do any preprocessing
necessary to get the text into shape for doing the
interesting work. I will also exercise more control
over what they are allowed to attempt (which is not
my usual style) in order to ensure more successful
outcomes.
I am not sure if I will use NLTK again or not. If
the designers make significant improvements on the
code and documentation, then I probably will. The
style and intent of the tutorials are quite appropriate
for the goals of the class. Students with stronger
coding background tended to use java for their final
projects, whereas the others tended to build on the
python code we developed in the class assignments,
which suggests that this kind of toolkit approach is
useful for them.

7 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999980421052632">
Overall, I feel the main goals of the course were met.
Although I am emphasizing how the course could be
improved, most students were quite positive about
the class, giving it an overall score of 5.8 out of 7
with a mode of 6 in their anonymous course reviews.
(This is on the low side for my courses; most who
gave it low scores found the programming too diffi-
cult.)
Most students found the material highly stimulat-
ing and the work challenging but not overwhelming.
Several students mentioned that a lab session with
a dedicated TA would have been desirable. Sev-
eral suggested covering less material in more depth
and several commented that the Enron exercise was
a neat idea although not entirely successful in execu-
tion. Students remarked on liking reading research
papers rather than a textbook (they also liked the rel-
atively light reading load, which I feel was appropri-
ate given the heavy assignment load). Some students

wanted more emphasis on real-world applications; I
think it would be useful to have guest speakers from
industry talk about this if possible.
I would like to see more research tools devel-
oped to a point to which they can be applied more
successfully, especially in the area of information
extraction. I would also recommend to colleagues
that careful control be retained over assignments and
projects to ensure feasibility in the outcome. It is
more difficult to get good results on class projects in
NLP than in other areas I’ve taught. As we so often
see in text analysis work, it can often be difficult to
do better than simple word counts for many projects.
I am interested in hearing ideas about how to ac-
commodate both the somewhat technical and the
highly technical students, especially in the early
parts of the course. Perhaps the best solution is to
offer an optional laboratory section, at least for the
first few weeks, but perhaps for the entire term, but
this solution obviously requires more resources.
When designing this course I did a fairly extensive
web search looking for courses that offered what I
was interested in, but didn’t find much. I used the
proceedings of the ACL-02 workshop on teaching
NLP (where I learned about NLTK) as well as the
NLP Universe. I think it would be a good idea to
start an archive of teaching resources; ACM SIGCHI
is in the midst of creating such an educational digital
library and this example is worth studying.9

Scripting tools such as python are fast and easy to prototype with, but require the students to learn a new programming language. Java is attractive because many tools are written in it and the MIMS students were familiar with java – they are required to use it for two of their required courses but still tend to struggle with it. I did not consider perl since python is a more principled language and is growing in acceptance and in tool availability. In the end I decided to require the students to learn python because I wanted to use NLTK, the Natural Language Toolkit (Loper and Bird, 2002). One goal of NLTK is to remove the emphasis on programming to enable students to achieve results quickly; and this aligned with my primary goal. NLTK seemed promising because it contained some well-written tutorials on n-grams, POS tagging and chunking, and contained text categorization modules. (I also wanted support for entity extraction, which NLTK does not supply.) NLTK is written in python, and so I decided to try it and have the students learn a new programming language. As will be described in detail below, our use of NLTK was somewhat successful, but we experienced numerous problems a</context>

As with NLTK, the documentation for Weka was incomplete and out of date, and it was difficult to determine how to use the more advanced features. We performed extended experimentation with the system and developed a detailed tutorial on how to use the system; this tutorial should be of general use.4 For the categorization task, we used the “twenty newsgroups” collection that was supplied with NLTK. Unfortunately, it was not preprocessed into sentences, so I also had to write some sentence splitting code (based on Palmer and Hearst (1997)) so students could make use of their tokenizer and tagger code. We selected one pair of newsgroups which contained very different content (rec.motorcycles vs. sci.space). We called this the diverse set. We then created two groups of newsgroups with more homogeneous content (a) rec.autos, rec.motorcycles, rec.sport.baseball, rec.sport.hockey, and (b) sci.crypt, sci.electronics, sci.med.original, sci.space. The intention was to show the students that it is easier to automatically distinguish the heterogeneous groups than the homogeneous ones. We set up the code to allow students to adjust the s</context>

Thus, I do not recommend the category labels be used for serious analysis. Nevertheless, a number of researchers have asked for the cleaned up database and categories, and we have made them publicly available, along with the search interface.7 The students were then given two weeks to process the collection in some manner. I made several suggestions, including trying to automatically assign the hand-assigned categories, extending some automatic acronym recognition work that we’d done in our research (Schwartz and Hearst, 2003), using named entity recognition code to identify various actors, clustering the collection, or doing some kind of social network analysis. Students were told that they could extend this assignment into their final projects if they chose. For most students it was difficult to obtain a strong result using this collection. The significant exception was for those students who worked on extending our acronym recognition algorithm; these projects were quite successful. (In fact, one student managed to improve on our results with a rather simple modification to our code.) Students often had creative</context>

Those who tried other topics were often too ambitious and had trouble getting meaningful results. However, several of those students were trying ideas that they planned to apply to their capstone projects, and so it was highly valuable for them to get a preview of what worked and what did not. One suggestion I made was to create a back-ofthe-book indexer, specifically for a recipe book, and one team did a good job with this project. Another was to improve on or apply an automatic hierarchy generation tool that we have developed in our research (Stoica and Hearst, 2004). Students working on a project to collect metadata for camera phone images successfully applied this tool to this problem. Again, social networking analysis topics were popular but not particularly successful; NLP tools are not advanced enough yet to meet the needs of this intriguing topic area. Not surprisingly, when students started with a new (interesting) text collection, they were bogged down in the preprocessing stage before they could get much interesting work done. 6.4 Reflecting on Assignments Although students were excited about the Enron collection and we created a resource that is</context>

Assignments 3 and 4 are described in the following subsections. 6.1 Text Categorization Assignment As mentioned above, text categorization is useful for a wide range SIMS applications, and we made it a centerpiece of the course. Unfortunately, we had to make a mid-course correction when I suddenly realized that text categorization was no longer available in NLTK. After looking at a number of tools, we decided to use the Weka toolkit for categorization (Witten and Frank, 2000). We did not want the students to feel they had wasted their time learning python and NLTK, so we decided to make it easy for the students to reuse their python code by providing an interface between it and Weka. My PhD student Preslav Nakov provided great help by writing code to translate the output of our python code into the input format expected by Weka. (Weka is written in java but has command line and GUI interfaces, and can read in input files and store models as output files.) As time went on we added increasingly more functionality to this code, tying it in with the NLTK modules so th</context>
