The editors of this book are both at The University of
Kansas, Lawrence. He is a professor of computer
science and sociology, and she is a professor of computer
science and linguistics. The influence of all these disci-
plines can be found in this book, which is in the Trends
in Linguistics series edited by Werner Winter.
The editors of the volume being reviewed here argue
that the amount of information processing capability that
has been brought to bear on the science of language is
very small. The volume is divided into two parts. The
first deals with formalization in literary and discourse
analysis; the second with notating the language of music
and the rhythms of speech.
In the first paper, &amp;quot;Computer Criticism&amp;quot;, John Smith
explains that computer applications for language and
literature studies have either involved the production of
aids with which most of us are familiar (e.g., dictionaries
or concordances) or have involved the use of the
computer for the analysis of specific works. He explains,
correctly I think, that the second offers a new methodol-
ogy that has been largely overlooked because of lack of
experience on the part of those who have traditionally
undertaken literary analysis. Smith correctly points out
that the computer can only augment the critics&apos; judg-
ment, not replace it, but he makes a convincing case that
such augmentation is of value.
Yorick Wilks offers a paper on the relationship
between the development of artificial intelligence and the
development of machine translation: &amp;quot;Machine Trans-
lation and the Artificial Intelligence Paradigm of
Language Processes&amp;quot;. He discusses three &amp;quot;intractables&amp;quot;
of natural language that many felt would be cleared up
by now: word sense ambiguity, case ambiguity, and
referential ambiguity. The paper presents examples from
artificial intelligence which make progress toward solving
these problems.
Bertram Bruce contributes a paper, entitled &amp;quot;Belief
Systems and Language Understanding&amp;quot;, that represents
an effort to use the computer to cope with intentionality.
It begins with an explanation of the role of belief in
natural language understanding and reviews two impor-
tant components of a belief system: social actions and
patterns of behavior. The paper deals with what is, to me
at least, one of the most fascinating topics in computa-
tional linguistics, credal regression, that is, beliefs about
beliefs.
The second part of the book deals with encoding and
opens with a short paper by the editors in which they
discuss the premise that the distinction between number
symbolism and non-number symbolism may be just as
important as the distinction between spoken and written
language. The first paper in the section is &amp;quot;The DARMS
(Digital-Alternate Representation of Musical Scores)
Project: Implementation of an Artificial Intelligence
Language for the Representation of Music&amp;quot;. The
relationship between music, language, and mathematics
has been demonstrated many times, even before the
introduction of the computer. However, until modern
times there was no means of preserving musical perform-
ance and therefore no means of analyzing or representing
it in any systematic way. The DARMS project is an
attempt to specify the representation of music notation as
a consistent and complete artificial language, namely
DARM, and to implement a set of DARMS translator
programs, or compilers. The article presents an historical
evolution of the project, a condensed grammatical
description of the language, and representative psycho-
linguistic problems encountered during implementation.
One of the interesting conclusions that can be drawn is
that our understanding of the semantic structure of
musical notation is nearly as impoverished as our under-
standing of the notation of natural language.
The final paper in the text is &amp;quot;Pausology&amp;quot; by Daniel
C. O&apos;Connell and Sabine Kowal. According to the
authors, this is a topic that, until recently, has received
little attention because of the lack of accurate and
reasonable, inexpensive voice recording equipment.
While the paper does provide a comprehensive history of
the topic, it has far less to do with computing then it does
with pausology. Much of the research documented in the
paper undoubtedly made use of computers as research
tools, but there is little direct description of those efforts.
What is the overall effect of these papers, which have
been grouped together under the title Trends in Linguis-
tics: Computers in Language Research, Volume 2? The
overall quality of the papers is good, with some, of
course, seeming stronger than others. The papers are
generally well researched and well written. However,
this reader had a great deal of difficulty ascertaining the
overall effect the volume was designed to have, if any.
As a collection, the volume seemed incohesive. While
the articles in the first section do share the common topic
of language, Bertram Bruce&apos;s &amp;quot;Belief Systems and
Natural Language Understanding&amp;quot; seems only inci-
dentally related to the other two in that section. The
situation in section two, which is entitled &amp;quot;Notating the
language of music, and the (pause) rhythms of speech&amp;quot;,
is even more dramatic. The article on the DARMS
project and the article on pausology may be related in
significant ways, but the editors never make that relation-
ship clear.
It is, of course, possible that a logical connection does
exist between the materials in the text and this reviewer
simply failed to perceive it. If that is the case, then I
would argue that the editors should have made more

effort, especially in transitional sections, to make these
connections clear.
It is also the volume&apos;s incohesiveness that makes this
reviewer question the audience for the volume. Each
paper seems directed at a specific audience and it is diffi-
cult to find a more general audience that would find the
text of interest. One might argue that it could be used as
an introduction to all the topics presented, but in this
reader&apos;s opinion the papers are at a level that requires a
background of some sophistication, though more in
linguistics than in computing. I am at a loss to suggest
any course in which the book might be used as a text. I
think there are a number of quality papers in this volume;
perhaps it can be best used to reference the included
papers on an individual basis.

This book is essential reading for anyone interested in
information retrieval. It describes in detail how to design
and carry out experiments in information retrieval and
how to analyze the results. Why should other workers in
computational linguistics read this book — aside from the
fact that, like all researchers, we are consumers of infor-
mation retrieval? Because it includes a fascinating
discussion of the philosophical and practical problems of
performing experiments, tremendously valuable at this
point when we are all supposed to be taking part in the
new experimental computer science.
This book also provides a guide to the main stream of
research in bibliographic information retrieval over the
last twenty-five years. In this paradigm, documents are
represented by lists of terms contained in the title, the
abstract, or, occasionally, the whole text, along with
frequency counts. Queries are represented by similar
statistics and then documents are located by matching the
word list from the query with the lists from the docu-
ments. Many refinements are possible: using phrases
instead of single words, adding a thesaurus, controlling
the indexing language, using feedback from the user.
The experiments described in this book have helped to
determine which of these strategies are of value and thus
have been crucial in the development of the sophisticated
systems of today.
There are fifteen chapters written by thirteen different
scholars. The fact that Karen Sparck Jones could
command the efforts of the best minds in information
retrieval testifies to the esteem in which she is held by
this community. In spite of the multiplicity of authors,
the book functions as a whole, with each chapter building
on the preceding ones. The editor clearly kept a strong
hand on every step of the writing process, through all
three parts of the book.
The four chapters in Part I are concerned with funda-
mental issues in the design of experiments. Robertson
sets the scene by discussing general methodology for
retrieval system testing. Van Rijsbergen focuses on the
issues involved in characterizing and measuring retrieval
system effectiveness. Belkin looks at the other side of
the problem — how to define human information needs
and determine whether a system is satisfying them.
Tague&apos;s chapter, the longest in the book, describes the
practical decisions that have to be made at every stage in
designing and carrying out an experiment. It could well
serve as a handbook for the would-be experimenter.
The second part discusses the problems of applying
this methodology in diverse practical situations. Some
experiments are directed at evaluating the performance
of systems that are actually in operation. Others are
essentially laboratory tests designed to investigate alter-
native methods of retrieval effectiveness. Lancaster
writes about the problems of &amp;quot;Evaluation within the
environment of an operating information service&amp;quot;. The
system he is talking about is a largely manual one.
Barraclough is trying to solve the same problems but in
an automated, largely interactive system. Keen tackles
the question of designing laboratory tests for manual
systems, while Oddy looks at the same question for fully
automatic systems. Heine defines some situations in
which simulation tests can give the best results. Cooper
argues for gedanken experiments as a substitute for, or at
least a preliminary to, expensive tests with actual data.
The third and final part of the book contains
descriptions of the major experiments in information
retrieval over the last twenty-five years. The first chap-
ter contains a survey by Sparck Jones of the development
of retrieval system testing during this period. The second
chapter, also by Sparck Jones, describes in detail the
influential series of experiments at Cranfield. The final
chapter, by Gerard Salton, describes his own exper-
imental system, the SMART system, which has served as
a testing ground for the most interesting developments in
the United States for the last fifteen years.
The whole book is a fascinating blend of philosophy
and practice centering on the problem of how to design
and carry out carefully controlled, valid experiments on
data that presents all the bewildering peculiarities of
human language.
