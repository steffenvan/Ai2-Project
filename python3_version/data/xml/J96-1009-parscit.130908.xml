In the foreword to this recent book by Larry Bookman, Wendy Lehnert writes, &amp;quot;this
volume is without question a milestone in language processing scholarship.&amp;quot; To put it
simply, I agree. In 236 pages, Bookman develops at length the two-tier model of seman-
tic memory that he first introduced in his doctoral dissertation on text comprehension.
The relational (symbolic) tier captures a set of dependency relationships between con-
cepts. The analog semantic-feature (ASF) tier represents (at the subsymbolic level)
common or shared knowledge about the concepts in the relational tier, expressed as a
set of statistical associations. This hybrid approach to NLU, named LeMICON (Learn-
ing Memory Integrated Context), stands out first and foremost because it claims to ad-
dress the bottleneck of hand-coding the knowledge required for interpretation. More
specifically, LeMICON offers both automatic acquisition of knowledge from on-line
text corpora and integration of a text&apos;s interpretation into the knowledge base. Before
commenting on this breakthrough, let me summarize the work.
Much like the model of Lange (1993) and my own model (Corriveau 1995), LeMI-
CON tackles most facets of text comprehension, in contrast with PDP models, such
as that of Miikkulainen (1993), which are typically more specialized. Bookman first
skillfully presents, in a 21-page introduction, the essential characteristics of his work.
LeMICON ignores syntax, but considers several psycholinguistic and neurolinguis-
tic problems that are typically ignored by others. For example, it models the loss of
information in working memory, and the time-course of inferences as well as their
construction process. Throughout this discussion, the spreading-activation process, so
typical of local and hybrid connectionist architectures such as LeMICON, is thought
of as constructing time trajectories through the space of ASFs. That is, &amp;quot;energy&amp;quot; propa-
gates through ASFs to form, over time, stable chains corresponding to inferences. The
notion of ASFs proceeds from Waltz and Pollack&apos;s (1985) use of &amp;quot;microfeatures&amp;quot;. More
specifically, each concept exists as a named node at the relational tier, but is expressed
as a set of ASFs; the network of these ASFs forms the associational tier. Furthermore,
&amp;quot;comprehension is more than just a passive trace through concept space&amp;quot;: activation of
relations between concepts &amp;quot;sets up an expectation of what patterns of knowledge are
likely to follow&amp;quot;. Consequently, as a result of its processing of a text, LeMICON gen-
erates two sources of knowledge: a set of ASF trajectories and an interpretation graph.

The set of ASF trajectories produced is a representation of the fine-grained knowledge
that LeMICON has accumulated in working memory as a result of its processing of
an input text. Conversely, the interpretation graph captures a &amp;quot;coarse-grained view
[of understanding as] a set of explicit graded semantic relationships that can be used
to reason about the meaning of a text.&amp;quot; Clearly, this dual nature of an interpretation
stems directly from the hybrid nature of the model. The introduction concludes with
a short account of the historical evolution of LeMICON and a useful plan for the rest
of the book.
The second chapter provides, in 26 pages, a brief overview of connectionist and
probabilistic research in NLU. Psycholinguistic considerations, organized around the
work of jurafsky (1992), are quite laconic. Conversely, the discussion of how connec-
tionist and probabilistic models combine and analyze information is not only original
in its presentation, but also thorough and yet highly readable. Not surprisingly, the
conclusion reached by Bookman is that &amp;quot;there is much to be gained in combining the
approaches of connectionist and computational linguistics models of language.&amp;quot;
Chapters 3 to 8 then detail, in 140 pages, the nature and workings of LeMICON.
First, the memory architecture is studied. On the one hand, the relational tier reduces
to a semantic network. On the other, ASFs are essentially microfeatures (augmented
to include background knowledge) and act as the prespecified conceptual primitives
of the system. But Bookman stresses that ASFs differ from both semantic features
(of symbolic models) and the microfeatures of PDP models. More specifically, ASFs
are based on and organized according to the conceptual categories and classifications
used by the Roget thesaurus, with some additional ASFs added to account for the
specific domain at hand (namely, stock market &apos;stories&apos;). However, the total number
of categories in a thesaurus is extremely large. Thus, in LeMICON, a subset of 454
of the categories from Roget are used to represent ASFs. Consequently, each concept
is associated with a background frame consisting of a vector of 454 ASFs! Working
memory consists of three short-term buffers: an input, a reactive, and a case-role buffer.
The case-role buffer stems from the fact that the actual input consists of a pre-parsed
input in which each concept and its filled case slots are replaced by their respective
ASF encodings, that is, by vectors of dimension 454!
As previously mentioned, a fundamental characteristic of the model is that as new
trajectories are triggered by the input, LeMICON attempts to integrate this new infor-
mation with antecedent knowledge. To achieve this, the model subscribes to Haber-
landt and Graesser&apos;s (1990) delayed-integration hypothesis: &amp;quot;strongly activated pat-
terns will remain active for a longer time and should therefore have a greater chance
of being successfully integrated.&amp;quot; Bookman does an excellent job of explaining how
this process is carried out in LeMICON. It is regrettable, however, that he fails to
consider the work of Gernsbacher (1990) on this topic.
In chapter 4, the comprehension algorithm is further detailed. In particular, sec-
tion 4.3 provides a step-by-step description of the modus operandi of LeMICON: Each
clause activates concepts in semantic memory. Case-role patterns are propagated, and
then competing assemblies are inhibited. Finally, relational novelty is computed and
working memory is updated to integrate relevant new information. This comprehen-
sion algorithm relies on notions such as ASF closeness and relational closeness. However,
these measures are not hardwired, but rather mathematically defined with respect
to concepts and ASFs! The representation of the input is also discussed further. For
example the sentence:
The stock market declined 50 points yesterday.

which, in turn, is encoded using a vertical concept assembly relating a high-level con-
cept to its relevant case-roles. LeMICON uses 16 case relations selected from previous
research on this topic. Bookman must be commended for the completeness and read-
ability of this thorough description, which includes computational details, treatment
of bindings, and links of LeMICON to psychology and neurophysiology. The chapter
concludes with an interesting comparison to several other text understanding systems.
In chapter 5, Bookman elaborates on the ability of LeMICON to both skim and
perform in-depth understanding. The presentation of some simple stories processed
by the system along with their corresponding summaries may remind the reader of
Dyer&apos;s (1983) seminal book. But quickly, Bookman moves from this qualitative analysis
to more specific issues, such as quantifying the volume of inferences, analyzing time-
dependent interactions, characterizing working memory closeness, and so on. Most
interestingly, LeMICON manages to build clusters of trajectories for similar stories
without requiring the plethora of knowledge structures found in Dyer&apos;s book.
Chapter 6 proceeds with a discussion of the uses of the interpretation graph for
reasoning about the interpretation of a text. In particular, this graph can serve to
identify the basic events (called the conceptual roots) of an interpretation and their
importance. These roots are essential to the summarization task.
Chapter 7 is first devoted to the acquisition of knowledge from on-line corpora.
LeMICON uses the Wall Street Journal database. The notion of mutual information is ap-
plied to pairs of concepts to determine their statistical relationship. The key point to un-
derstand here is that ultimately the whole approach rests on detecting co-occurrences
of concepts in the corpus. The rest of the chapter addresses how memory is updated as
it processes the input and constructs the interpretation. In chapter 8, Bookman takes
a close look at the kind of knowledge that is learned and introduces the notion of
knowledge effectiveness to compare different text understanding systems with respect
to the use and complexity of the information they process.
To conclude, Bookman recapitulates in chapter 9 the important contributions of
his work, and they are numerous. Then, in chapter 10, future directions are proposed:
dealing with more than 100 concepts, learning deeper semantic relationships, handling
contradictory input, and so on. Finally, the book includes several appendices detailing
the ASFs used, the complexity of the different algorithms, the nature of the pre-parsed
input and some additional results.
LeMICON is not perfect. Bookman explains that LeMICON ignores syntax and
metaphoric text, as well as complex inferences (such as social ones). And it uses a
limited form of temporal reasoning. Most importantly, LeMICON must preprocess
the background knowledge for each new text, &amp;quot;a severe limitation for any real-time
practical text system&amp;quot; by Bookman&apos;s own admission. In my opinion, there are three
problems with such a preprocessing strategy. First, any non-automated translation
process is unavoidably subjective and typically eliminates important facets of com-
prehension (such as structural ambiguity). Indeed, it is not even clear whether or not
LeMICON does address genuine lexical and referential ambiguities. Second, both the
structure of the input format and the specific primitives used in the actual input (i.e.,
the ASF encodings) must be known a priori. In other words, the processing strategy
relies on a fixed prespecified representational scheme that makes specific epistemo-
logical commitments. This is most noticeable in reading that the 454 ASFs were partly
chosen with respect to a particular domain, the stock market. Third, it appears that

<bodyText confidence="0.999954206896551">
the model has poor space complexity, because each concept of the input text requires
a large vector of features.
And now for the crucial claim: that LeMICON learns the knowledge base that
it uses for comprehension. In my opinion, this is only partly true. First, one could
object to the use of co-occurrence for genuine learning (see Corriveau (1995, chapter 2)
for details). But more fundamentally, one must understand that, in LeMICON, the
knowledge base is not constructed entirely from corpus. In fact, each concept of the
relational tier consists of a prespecified schema defined by the possible case relations
known to the system: LeMICON uses &amp;quot;approximately 100 concepts [that] were chosen
based on how representative they were for the given stock market domain&amp;quot;. Only the
relationships between these subjectively chosen concepts are learned, not the concepts
themselves. And all ASFs are hardwired a priori in LeMICON: no ASF can be learned.
Thus, a &amp;quot;new&amp;quot; concept for LeMICON is merely a concept with a known ASF encoding,
but not yet included in the relational tier. There is apparently no learning on the ASF
tier, the most important of the two tiers of the model. For example, hospital is always
related to emergency, admission, care, and discharge. Viewing a hospital in a different
way (e.g., as a workplace for nurses and doctors) cannot be learned, regardless of
the number of texts processed by LeMICON. It follows that LeMICON constructs the
interpretation of a text from a set of fixed meanings. From this standpoint, the system
is still missing the key ability to modify what it has learned statistically from a corpus
in light of the texts it processes. More specifically, beyond the integration of parts of
an interpretation into the knowledge base, the meaning of words must be diachronic,
that is, evolve over time. And the meaning of a word in a sentenceâthat is, its set of
features relevant in that particular contextâmust be constructed from its interactions
with surrounding words, not merely recognized. We still lack a computational theory
for such models. We are still far away from Rastier&apos;s (1991, p. 114) truly contextual
view of meaning where every &amp;quot;semantic occurrence is a hapax.&amp;quot; But Bookman must
receive immense credit for addressing how the knowledge base is initially constructed
in text comprehension systems, a fundamental requirement for scalability.
