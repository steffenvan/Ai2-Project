The purpose of this paper is to formally examine hyphenation as it pertains to Modern Greek with
the aim of achieving accurate and thorough machine hyphenation. Grammar rules are interpreted
and formally expressed in terms of regular expressions of word substrings, and exact hyphenation
rules are derived. Vowel splitting, which traditionally is indicated in terms of prohibitive rather
than explicit grammar rules, is examined in detail. Many ambiguities caused by circular defini-
tions of the prohibitive rule vowel sequences are detected, an overwhelming majority of which are
resolved within the present framework.

Hyphenator programs in modern typesetting systems are necessary to eliminate ex-
cess space between adjacent words in texts. Word hyphenation could be bypassed by
stretching out this space, but this would effect the appearance of the document. A
hyphenator program takes as input a word and returns the set of points within the
word where hyphens are permissible. Word hyphenation depends strictly on the target
natural language, and many of the problems encountered are language specific.
In general, machine hyphenation can be achieved either by consulting lists of
hyphenated words or by developing pattern-based hyphenation programs (Liang 1983;
Knuth 1986). The first approach ensures complete and correct hyphenation, but it has
the disadvantage of being incapable of hyphenating words not on the list. In particular,
for highly inflectional languages, such as Greek, these word lists would have to be
extremely extensive in order to include all possible inflectional and derivational word
forms. Even if such lists could be generated, it would be impossible to include words
such as compounds, which can be readily created, or all proper names. In addition,
the initial step toward the development of lists of hyphenated words is commonly
rule-based hyphenation. On the other hand, although the second approach does not
raise such problems, it has the disadvantage of being unable to guarantee complete
and accurate hyphenation.
The aim of the present study has been to analytically examine Modern Greek
hyphenation in order to develop a pattern-based hyphenator. The requirement specifi-
cations are defined as follows: (i) to strictly prohibit impermissible hyphen generation;
(ii) to generate a hyphen list that is as complete as possible.
Existing hyphenator programs meet the first requirement either by decreasing the
number of proposed hyphens or by establishing stop lists containing the appropriately
hyphenated exceptional words. Commonly, fulfilling the second requirement depends
on the development of extensive subword patterns associated with hyphenation rules,
as in Liang 1983, for example. Establishing lists of exceptions has the same disadvan-
tages as the approach to hyphenating through consulting lists of hyphenated words,

and thus hyphenator dependencies on lists of exceptions must be restricted as much
as possible.
Native Greek speakers are able to hyphenate most Greek words fully and unam-
biguously. In extreme cases, they will propose two hyphen sets for the same word, one
being a proper subset of the other, but both being acceptable. However, complete au-
tomatic hyphenation is a rather complex task. Although consonant splitting is clearly
determined by the grammar rules of Modern Greek and is thus easily expressed in
terms of non-exceptional formal patterns associated with specific hyphenation rules,
vowel splitting is not. The main problem of vowel splitting is that the grammar in-
dicates the cases where splitting is not allowed, and the splitting of a large number
of these cases is ambiguous. In addition, Greek vowels are sometimes accented, so
ambiguity resolution concerns thousands of vowel sequences.
Existing hyphenator programs for Modern Greek are available as either commer-
cial or research-based products and usually work on a minimal basis, i.e., finding only
hyphenation points of consonant sequences. Some research-based versions, includ-
ing one application of the TEX (Knuth 1986) hyphenator for Greek, achieve improved
hyphenation but cover a minimal subset of the vowel sequences.
The present paper will encapsulate the standard grammar hyphenation rules and
the general principles used in this study. The paper expresses these rules (which
focus mainly on consonant sequences) formally and points out their limitations in
terms of formal word expressions that can be completely and correctly hyphenated.
The paper then turns to the problem of vowel splitting, and, by formally examining
prohibitive grammar rules, deduces general hyphenation rules. It presents additional
heuristic rules discovered during an exhaustive search of ambiguous vowel patterns,
and demonstrates the degree of the resolved ambiguity in terms of the number of
vowel sequences that have been disambiguated. Implementation issues are discussed,
as well as the problem of words written in uppercase letters. Finally, the paper outlines
the potential for generalization to other languages.

2.1 Consonant Splitting
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9992185">
According to KEME (1983)1, the splitting of a Modern Greek word into syllables is
governed by the following rules:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.930075777777778">
Cl. A single consonant between two vowels is hyphenated with the
succeeding vowel.
C2. A sequence of two consonants between two vowels is hyphenated with
the succeeding vowel, if a Greek word exists that begins with such a
consonant sequence. Otherwise the sequence is split into two syllables.
C3. A sequence of three or more consonants between two vowels is
hyphenated with the succeeding vowel, if a Greek word exists that
begins with the sequence of the first two consonants. Otherwise it splits;
the first consonant being hyphenated with the preceding vowel.

of the grammar rules. As can easily be observed, the grammar rules are pattern based.
Thus, the input word is divided into substrings, and the corresponding rules are
applied to the substrings. Specifically, the goal is to identify the regular expressions
of the patterns and the exact hyphen points for each formal pattern. Ambiguity issues
caused by the interpretation of the grammar rules will be resolved. We will also prove
that rules C1-C3 are not sufficient to provide complete hyphenation coverage of Greek
words. This study will be based on rules C1-C3 and, in addition, the informal definition
of a syllable as consisting of at least one or more vowels, or vowel(s) accompanied
with one or more consonants (Triantafillidis 1978, 38), shall be adopted.
Let V be the set of vowel characters, C the set of consonant characters, V E V, and
C E C. Specifically, V = {a, E, j, , 0, v, w, d, 1, 6, &apos;6, c;), 1, &apos;I), r)}, C = {i3, -y, 6,
(, 0, tc, A, p, v, p, a-, T, p,X, &apos;0}. Subscripts, e.g., v2, c2 are used in order
to distinguish more than one vowel or consonant of the same pattern. The beginning
or end of the input word is indicated by the symbol &apos;I.&amp;quot;. Optionality is indicated by
placing characters inside square brackets. The operation obtaining one or more strings
is denoted by the symbol &amp;quot;+&amp;quot;. The operation obtaining zero or more strings is denoted
by &amp;quot;k&amp;quot;, or Kleene star (Lewis and Papadimitriou 1981).
We shall begin with the formal representation of the grammar rule subword pat-
terns. The substrings of rules Cl, C2, and C3 constitute one or more consonants be-
tween two vowels, or the strings of the expression vic+02. Let c1 be the first (obligatory)
consonant in the consonant sequence of that expression. Let c2 and c3 be the second
and the last (optional) consonants of the same sequence. Thus, the expression can be
written as v1 c1 [c2c*c3] v2. Therefore:

The substrings of grammar rules Cl, C2 and C3 are contained in the set of the expres-
sion vici [c2c*c3]v2.
Grammar rules Cl, C2, and C3 determine the hyphenation of word substrings
comprising embedded consonants between vowels. They do not apply to substrings
containing initial or final consonants. According to the informal definition of syllable
given above, a syllable has at least one vowel and thus the consonant prefixes and
suffixes of a word cannot constitute entire syllables. In other words, the maximal
consonant prefix of a word is always hyphenated with the following vowel and the
maximal consonant suffix of a word is always hyphenated with the preceding vowel.
The permissible hyphen points of words are located between the syllables, thus:

<bodyText confidence="0.961292923076923">
(a) For all words containing a substring oc1 [c2c*c3], the point immediately following
c3, and (b) for all words containing a substring c1[c2c*c3]., the point immediately pre-
ceding cl, are impermissible hyphen points.
In contrast, Cl, C2, and C3 specify permissible hyphen points. However, two dif-
ferent interpretations can be given, namely that (i) only one hyphen point is specified
by the rules, i.e., the point preceding or (exclusively) following the first embedded
consonant ci or that (ii) two additional hyphen points are permissible: those preced-
ing the first and following the second vowel. Both interpretations specify one common
permissible hyphen point, which is, therefore, non-ambiguous. To define this point
formally, let CC be the set of consonant sequences, two characters in length, that can
begin a Greek word. (The exact definition&apos; of set CC is given in Table 1. This set was
extracted by the extensive listing of the initial word syllables presented in Setatos
[19711).

The strings of the expression vici [c2c*c3]02 are hyphenated as 01 - c1[c2c*c3]v2 if c1 [c2] E

<bodyText confidence="0.400772">
Rule Cl indicates that the strings of expression vici v2 are always hyphenated as 01-
ci v2. These strings are a proper subset of vici [c2c*c31v2 and they do not contain con-
sonants c2c*c3. Thus, c1[c2] is degenerated to cl, while c1 E C by definition, and hence
[c2c*c31v2 are always hyphenated as 01 - c1[c2c*c3]02.
The remaining strings are 01c1c2[c*c3]02, and, as indicated by C2 and C3, their
hyphen point is the point preceding c1 if c1c2 E CC or the point between c1 and c2
otherwise.

from set CC under specific contexts, see for example, paragraph 81, note 4 of Trantafillidis (1941) and
paragraphs 140, and 141 of Tsopanakis (1994). The official grammar book (KEME 1983) however, does
not treat these sequences as exceptional.

Theorem 2
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999251">
The points immediately preceding 01 and immediately following v2 in the strings of

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.968744">
Proof
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99983364516129">
Suppose that grammar rules indicate that the points immediately preceding 01 and
immediately following v2 are also permissible hyphen points. By further taking into
account Theorem 1, the assumption is that vici [c2c*c3]v2 is hyphenated either as -01 -
ci [c2c*c3]v2 -, or exclusively as - v1c1 - [c2c*c3]v2
A hyphen is not permitted at the beginning or the end of the word, thus the
possibility that the substring is located at the beginning or the end of the word is by
definition excluded. Consequently, there is at least one character preceding 01 and one
following 02. Consider the case where a consonant or consonant sequence precedes 02.
If it is at the beginning of the word, according to Lemma 4(a) the hyphen cannot be
inserted after the consonant(s) and hence the assumption of a hyphen before 01 is false.
Respectively, for the case of a final consonant, or consonant sequence after 02, according
to Lemma 4(b) a hyphen following 02 is not permitted. Now consider the case of a non-
initial consonant or consonant sequence preceding 01. In this case, Theorem 1 specifies
one non-ambiguous hyphen point, which will not always be the point preceding 01;
hence the assumption is again, false. For the case of a nonfinal consonant sequence
following 02, the point implied by Theorem 1 may, in certain contexts, indicate the
same point as the assumption, but in other contexts it may not. Nevertheless, in both
cases the correct point will always be specified, thus the assumed rule does not need to
be reapplied in order to indicate a potentially impermissible hyphen. Cases of a vowel
preceding vi or following 02 remain to be examined. In these cases, Theorem 1 does
not define additional hyphen points, and Lemma 4 does not indicate impermissible
hyphen points. The issue to examine is vowel splitting independent of consonants.
As we shall see in the following section, vowel splitting is not always permissible.
To present the proof in its entirety, it would be sufficient to give two contradictory
examples, where the points preceding 01 and following 02 are not permissible hyphen
points, e.g., av-A7) [av-111 &apos;courtyard&apos;, and 7ra â Atoc [pa-lids] &apos;old&apos;.
Therefore, the assumption does not always hold. 0
A summarized formal definition of the hyphenation patterns and their associated
rules as discussed above is presented in Table 1. Theorem 2 gives further support to
the proposition that grammar rules are not capable of completely hyphenating all NL
words.

Every syllable has at least one vowel, thus a word cannot have syllables exceeding

containing consecutive vowels. Then, if the word begins with a consonant or consonant
sequence the number of non-ending maximal consonant sequences is n, or otherwise,
n-1. Consequently, all such words have exactly n syllables. According to the definition
of a hyphen, these words have exactly n â 1 hyphen points.

tion of consonant splitting has not set any restrictions on the maximum length or even
on the existence of certain consonant sequences. The phthong sequences that Modern
Greek permits are, however, restricted by principles of grammar that are assumed to
be universal. In the case of consonants, these principles state that the maximal conso-
nant sequence is four characters long, and the maximal consonant prefix and suffix of
Greek words are three characters and one character long, respectively (Setatos 1971).
If these principles had been used in the examination of consonant splitting, the set of
all subword patterns of Table 1 would have been restricted to the set of expression
vici [c2c3c41v2. Similarly, prefix and suffix consonant sequences would be restricted to
.c1[c2c3] and c., respectively. Furthermore, restrictions of specific sequences not possible
in Greek words would further confine these patterns. Loanwords sometimes challenge
these principles. Loanwords have been incorporated into Greek since ancient times and
include words that cannot easily be recognized as borrowed, because of their adap-
tation into the above principles. Other loanwords, most frequently words that end
in more than one consonant, e.g., yotAtz [film] &apos;film&apos;, have not completely adapted. A
sequence of more than three consonants at the beginning of the word is also possible,
as in the word ricliTaVOW [gdansk] &apos;Gdansk&apos; (the city in Poland), although it is quite
infrequent. Cases of more than four consonants may also exist or might appear in
new loanwords or, most likely, occur in artificial words such as tongue twisters. Loan-
word hyphenation is governed by the same grammar rules as the rest of the language.
Thus, in order to cover hyphenation of such loanwords, the patterns of Table 1 must
not be eliminated. Apparently, this means that loanword hyphenation is independent
of the rules governing hyphenation in the original language from which the word was
borrowed. For example, although no hyphen point is derived by the Greek rules for
the loanwords cotAit [film] &apos;film&apos;, ravK [tank] &apos;tank&apos;, words having common deriva-
tives of these, such as cotAptint [filmdki] &apos;small film&apos; and T611kEp [tdriker] &apos;tanker&apos; are
hyphenated as cotA-fice-kt [fil-mÃ¡-ki] and Tciv-KEp [tan-ker].

As already discussed, the rules presented in Table 1 cover hyphenation of word sub-

Vowel splitting is quite common in Modern Greek and is usually handled in grammar
books with prohibitive rules. These are included within the context of the definition
of various vowel combinations, but are rarely explicitly included within the set of
standard hyphenation rules.&apos;

the orthographic representation of the various word substrings. Phonetic transcriptions
are presented for the reader who is not familiar with Greek. Although phonetics is the
ultimate basis for hyphenation, our approach is based on the available data, which
is the orthographic representation of words, and not a transcription in a phonetic
alphabet such as IPA.
As it has been previously defined, the term vowel refers to a single vowel or
vowel character; V is the set of vowels. Double-vowel blends are phonetically equiv-
alent to vowels, and their orthographic representation comprises two vowel charac-
ters. Let 2V be the set of double-vowel blends, 2V --= {at, E OL, V t, ov,a1,61,o1,,vi,o}
(In [i], [u],[4,[1],[1],[u]l). Some two-vowel orthographic combinations are pho-
netically equivalent to a vowel-consonant sound. Let VC be the set of such two-
vowel combinations, VC = {av, Ev, iv, a15, Fo, ({ [av], [Ey], [iv], [Ã¡v], [tv], [iv]}). Fi-
nally, diphthongs and excessive diphthongs&apos; are vowel sequences consisting of two
parts; each part can comprise either a vowel or a double-vowel blend. Precisely, the
set of diphthongs and excessive diphthongs is a proper subset of {fif2: fi,f2 E VU 2V}.
The prohibitive hyphenation rules regarding vowel splitting are as follows:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.71844525">
Vi. Double-vowel blends do not split.
V2. The combinations av, Ey, 717), at5, eo, and 7To do not split.&apos;
V3. Diphthongs do not split.
V4. Excessive diphthongs do not split.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998669842105263">
All of the above rules are negative in that they indicate impermissible hyphen points
within particular substrings of consecutive vowels. As the goal of the hyphenator is to
identify the permissible hyphen points, we interpret VI., V2, V3, and V4 complemen-
tarily, i.e., in all other cases, splitting is allowed. It is important to note that the ultimate
goal is to specify the permissible hyphen points in any vowel sequence, and not only
in the particular substrings of sequences mentioned in V1, V2, V3, and V4. Formally,
for every vowel sequence vo _of n vowels, and its corresponding set of points
â fhi: hi is the point between vi and v,+1, 0 &lt; i &lt; n-11, the issue is to identify
set 1P1,0 v1 c Pv0...0â_1 of the impermissible hyphen points. Then the set of
the permissible points will be their set difference, or PPvo...v â P00.â¢ .v â IPoo . â¢ â¢Vn-1 â¢
Let us first formally specify the impermissible hyphen points in the particular
sequences of V1âV4 rules. The combinations contained in V1, V2, V3, and V4 are
distinguished in terms of their constituent elements. All combinations are made up of
two parts; both parts of double-vowel blends and combinations av, ev, etc. of rule V2
are vowels, while both parts of diphthongs and excessive diphthongs can be either
vowels or double-vowel blends. Therefore, the impermissible hyphen point is located
between the two parts in all combinations. For double-vowel blends and the elements
of VC, which are digrams by definition, the impermissible hyphen point falls between
its two constituent vowels, or

to apply to words containing a maximum of two vowel substrings that are elements
of 2V or VC.
Lemma 5
The rules presented in Table 1 are sufficient to completely hyphenate all words in
which each vowel sequence is included in set v1 [v21, such that v1[v21 E V U 2V u VC.
For words containing at least One n-gram vowel sequence, with n &gt; 2, it is not
apparent which vowel pairs, if any, will constitute a double-vowel blend or a VC
so that the associated negative rules can be applied. Furthermore, diphthongs and
excessive diphthongs comprised of either digrams consisting of two vowels, or tri-
grams consisting of a vowel and a double-vowel blend, or tetragrams consisting of
two double-vowel blends, need to be precisely separated before the rules are applied.
This procedure is called tokenization (see for example, Aho et al. [1986]). Tokenization
in this case takes as input a vowel sequence and returns a sequential list of maximal
non-overlapping tokens of the types 2V, VC and V. Tokens do not overlap in that every
vowel of the sequence is assigned to one and only one token. Tokenization might
be ambiguous in that it might generate alternative token lists for specific vowel se-
quences. More precisely, alternative token lists can be generated for sequences where
a vowel can be associated to its left or its right neighboring vowel in order to build up
a 2V or VC token.&apos; However, tokenization is achieved unambiguously because vowels
are examined from left to right and a concrete token of the V type is extracted if it
does not form a double-vowel blend or an element of the VC set with its subsequent
vowel. Otherwise, a token of 2V or VC type is extracted. In conclusion, 2V and VC
are disjoint, thus tokenization results in a unique list of tokens.
Let any vowel sequence vo _of n vowels, and its k-token sequence fo . â¢

PPvo., and P00. ..V_1 D P10...A_1. According to (1), the elements of their
set difference P000, ...v â are all impermissible. Thus, the points that remain
to be examined in regard to their hyphen permissibility are elements of set Ph..f,_,
This examination will be directed by V3 and V4 prohibitive rules. To conclude, formal
definitions of diphthong and excessive diphthong sets would suffice. In this case, the
specification of permissible hyphens would be based on whether each sequence of
pairwise consecutive tokens is an element of one of these sets.
Identification of diphthongs and excessive diphthongs is a difficult task because
of the ambiguity that arises when attempting to make specific designations. There are
extreme cases where sequences exist whose assignment as diphthongs is context de-
pendent. Some instances remain ambiguous even within precise contexts. Specifically,
they may or may not be labeled as diphthongs, depending on the specific dialect or on
the personal preference of the native speaker. To deal with this problem formally we
shall determine weaker boundaries of diphthongs and excessive diphthongs. When
considering hyphenation in regard to diphthongs, the problem is that diphthong def-
initions are circular, as in Triantafillidis (1978, 33), who states that &amp;quot;two vowels&apos; that

are pronounced together in one syllable constitute a diphthong.&amp;quot; The circularity of
this definition was observed by Petrounias (1984, 393), who proposes a less risky
and more formal definition; namely, &amp;quot;a diphthong is made up of a semivowel and
a vowel.&amp;quot; Although the general issue of diphthongs is discussed at length, focusing
on the development of ancient diphthongs and on phonetic issues, it is not discussed
from a hyphenation perspective. A more clear approach is proposed by Tsopanakis
(1994, 39, 84) who states that Modern Greek diphthongs are made up of a semivowel
or /u/ and a vowel or double-vowel blend.&apos; Although linguists do not always
agree with the terminology, in order to avoid confusion, the simplified definition shall
be usedânamely that in diphthongs the semivowel is on the right and in excessive
diphthongs, on the left.&apos; Because semivowels are represented by vowel characters or
double-vowel blends, the two categories overlap. In short, diphthong vowel sequences
are suffixed with semivowels /i/ or /u/ and excessive diphthongs prefixed by an /i/
or /u/ semivowel.
The semivowel is not automatically identified, thus, practically, we have to deal
with a large set of candidate diphthongs and candidate excessive diphthongs. Formally,
these sets are defined as:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.398443">
Candidate Diphthongs: CD = {fx: f EVU2V, xEIU L/}
Candidate Excessive Diphthongs: CED = {xf: fE VU 2V, xEIU 11}
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999395">
where I is the set of all vowels or double-vowel blends that are phonetically equiv-
alent to /i/ and LI is the set of all double-vowel blends that are phonetically equivalent
to /u/.1Â° The complete sets are as follows: I =
and U = {ov,oV}. Therefore, every sequence of two tokensfifjÂ±i in the k-token sequence
fo â¢ â¢ â¢fk_i, 0 &lt; j &lt; k â 1, that is not a diphthong candidate or excessive diphthong can-
didate can, by definition, be split. Hence, formally the points between the tokens fj
and fiÂ±i of every sequence f1 such that fil+1 E (V U 2V U VC) x (VU 2V U VC) â (VU
2V) x (I U U) â (I U U) x (V U 2V) are permissible. Equivalently, (i) the points adjacent
to a VC token and any other token are permissible hyphen points and (ii) the points
located between two consecutive tokens f1, fjÂ±i such that fp fjÂ±i E (V U 2V) â (I U U)
are also permissible points.
To conclude then, vowel splitting may be summarized by the following Lemma:

2.2.1 Diphthong Identification. In the previous section, vowel splitting was formally
examined and concrete hyphenation rules were derived. However, as Lemma 6(c)
explicitly acknowledges, hyphenation is restricted by diphthongs and excessive diph-
thongs. In this section, we shall proceed to an empirical examination of diphthongs
and excessive diphthongs. Taking into account the initial specification that the hyphen-
ator should never generate non-acceptable hyphens, and in order to pare down the
enormous sets of candidate diphthongs and excessive diphthongs, we need to isolate
the subset of sequences for which splitting is always permitted.
The approach followed was to first select all sequences of the above sets that
were mentioned in various grammar books as examples of diphthongs and to assign
them to the category of &amp;quot;neversplitting sequences.&amp;quot; Then experimental matches were
conducted through an electronic dictionary of Modern Greek that encodes 100,000
lemmata and all their inflectional and derivational forms (Vagelatos et al. 1995), and
a 13 Mbyte corpus of newspaper articles. By definition, this process could not be au-
tomatic because hyphens were not included in the lexicon or the corpus, but there
were far too many matches to be examined manually. Manual examination was re-
stricted to those matches having limited frequency of occurrence. Nevertheless, during
this process, a systematic method of identifying additional nonsplitting sequences was
discovered based on a rule for stressing that states that a stress mark can only be ap-
plied to the ultimate, penultimate, or antepenultimate position of a word. Words in
the lexicon were hyphenated based on the assumption that all remaining candidates
do split. This hyphenation, however, resulted in certain words whose stress appeared
on a syllable to the left of the antepenultimate position. Apparently then, incorrect
hyphenation had been applied. All diphthong and excessive diphthong candidates
included in these words were collected and designated nonsplitting sequences.
For the remaining candidates, identification of particular categories of substrings
where a general exclusion rule may apply was attempted. Disparate and sometimes
contradictory views given in various books (Setatos 1971; Triantafillidis 1978; Petrou-
nias 1984; Mackridge 1987; Tsopanakis 1994) were collected. Their integrity was ex-
tensively examined through selection of matching words found in the corpus and in

the lexicon. This empirical process resulted in formally expressed rules independent
of any exceptions. The sets of categories found are not necessarily disjoint, whereas
all overlaps always lead to consistent hyphenation. All categories found are explained
below, and representative hyphenated examples along with IPA transcriptions and
translations are given. In order to avoid confusion, hyphenation is applied to those
vowel sequences corresponding to the category currently being explained, and not to
the entire word. Formal definitions of all categories are given in Table 2.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.8079441">
1. Examination of excessive diphthong candidates showed that 50% are
immediately eliminated, i.e., always split. Specifically, rule F4 states that
candidate excessive diphthongs whose first part is stressed do always
split, e.g., Tat8e1,-a [pE61-a] &apos;education&apos;, torropt-a [istorf-a] &apos;history&apos;,
ta)-no-ri [K1-isi] &apos;pregnancy&apos;, 131,atoc [vi-Eos] &apos;violent&apos;, Art-oc [Ii-os]
&apos;smooth&apos;, T poi,-a [tri-a] &apos;Troy&apos;. On the other hand, not all diphthong
candidates whose second part is stressed split, but the candidates in this
set that are not simultaneously excessive do always split (rule F5, Table
2).
2. Another category is associated with the existence of the diaeresis mark
on a vowel of either a candidate diphthong or an excessive diphthong.
All candidates whose second vowel has both a diaeresis mark and a
stress mark do always split, e.g., Ma-boy [Ma-fu] &apos;May&apos;, po-i7TraXn
[pro-fparksi] &apos;preexistence&apos;, E&apos;a-ziAcoo-ii [Eksa-flosi] &apos;immateriality&apos;. In
addition, all candidates having as first or second token a f) always split,
e.g., ci-i)Aoc [d-ilos] &apos;immaterial&apos;, po-fnro0Eoli [pro-ipdOesi] &apos;prerequistic&apos;,
AaOpoii-aAovp-yia [1a0roi-alur-yfa] &apos;glass smuggling&apos;. As well, candidates
that have as a first part only a nonstressed I always split. Formally, this
category is defined by rules F6 and F7 (Table 2). Diaeresis marks were
used as a discriminating factor for additional candidates. The
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999023111111111">
single-stress system imposed on Modern Greek in the last decade, states
that &amp;quot;if the absence of the diaeresis mark does not generate ambiguity
the mark should be eliminated&amp;quot; (Mackridge 1987, 93). Theoretically, this
simplification could be applied to a variety of vowel sequences, but
examination shows that acceptable words containing such sequences do
not always exist, and not all sequences split. We focus on four that
always split, namely: co7&apos;) - &amp;quot;co-ticpt,o [zo-Ifio] &apos;vermin&apos;, (iv - c&apos;t-vAoc [d-ilos]
&apos;incorporeal, immaterial&apos;, iv - apt-vrripertic [arxi-ipiretis] &apos;butler&apos;, a) -
71-ept-t513ptay [peri-ivrisi] &apos;insult&apos; (rule Fg, Table 2).
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.963805384615385">
3. Another observation is that all diphthong candidates having an ov or ozi
as a second part, and whose first part is not in set I always split. e.g.,
KAal,-ovo-a [kle-usa] &apos;weeping willow&apos;, vTa-aziAta [da-tilia] &apos;drums&apos;,
p,a-ova [ma-tina] &apos;barge&apos;, wpai-ovc [ore-us] &apos;beautiful&apos;. Furthermore, the
category is expanded to include candidates whose second part is a
double-vowel blend. At this point it should be stressed that there are
specific examples where the candidate vowel sequence could
linguistically be considered a diphthong based on pronunciation
(Triantafillidis 1978, 19). However, during hyphenation they split de
facto, e.g., rd-rt [pd-i] &apos;goes&apos;, a-Et0aMc [a-i0alis] &apos;evergreen&apos; (rule F9,
Table 2).
4. Rule F10 is associated with those candidate excessive diphthongs that
have an ov or oi&apos;) as a first part. Note that the stressed /u/ has been

already included in F4 because of the stress mark. Detailed examination
of the candidates of this category led to the conclusion that the
candidates always split during hyphenation. Although sometimes they
are pronounced as diphthongs, they are split de facto, e.g., 4&gt;E0pov-dptoc
[feyru-drios] &apos;February&apos;, Oov-rp-6 [vu-itO] &apos;clamor&apos;, 6ov-ket [vu-izi] &apos;it
clamors&apos;, BEbov-ivoc [ve6U-Inos] &apos;Bedouin&apos;, Ov-a Ala [u-alial &apos;Wales&apos;,
alcov-oper [aku-ometrIa] &apos;acoustic metrics&apos;.
5. An interesting subset of candidates concerns the intersection of candidate
diphthong and excessive diphthong sets. This set is (I u U) x (I U U) and
although it comprises a relatively great number of elements, most of
these have low frequency of occurrence in linguistically acceptable
words. It should be noted here that some parts of this set have already
been covered by other rules. For the subset not covered, no general rule
was formulated but particular instances that always split were identified.
These instances are covered by rule Fn. We observed that some cases
present ambiguity, while others always split e.g., 6t-tarcip,Evoc&apos;
[Si-istdmEnos] &apos;contrary&apos;, 6t-taiattat [5i-IstamE] &apos;I dissent&apos;, 6t-nOnitivoc
[61-i0imZuos] &apos;filtered&apos;, 6t-Trapcor tick [5i-ipirotilo5s] &apos;intercontinental&apos;,
6t=r)Onan [61-10isi] &apos;filtering&apos;, St-07112a [61-1-yima] &apos;short story&apos;, itv-npivoc
[mi-imenos] &apos;initiated&apos;, px-lio-Etc [mi-Isis] &apos;initiate&apos;, 7rot-777-4c [pi-itis]
&apos;poet&apos;, R-ot-i)o-Etc [pi-Isis] &apos;you will do&apos;, avrocov-Eic [aftofi-Is] &apos;self-grown&apos;,
eirorknrot-Eic [epiplopi-Is] &apos;furniture-makers&apos;, ak-Ela [ali-fa] &apos;fishing&apos;,
vt-Ã³c [i-cis] &apos;son&apos;, vt-o0Eo-ict [i-oBesial &apos;adoption&apos;, cip7rvc-ct [arpi-a] &apos;harpy&apos;.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9399306">
6. There is a different rule for determining the splitting of excessive
diphthongs, referred to by both Triantafillidis (1978, 38) and Tsopanakis
(1994, 108). It concerns the natural semantics of excessive diphthongs;
the avoidance of hiatus in the spoken language. If the flow of speech is
constrained by the existence of additional &amp;quot;difficult&amp;quot; or complex
phthongs, the pronunciation of the excessive diphthong in one syllable
becomes impossible. One such case is that of at least a double-consonant
sequence, whose second consonant is p [r] followed by a candidate
excessive diphthong. That diphthong is not excessive and should always
be split (rule F12, Table 2).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.996060866666667">
It should be noted that additional rules covering additional vowel sequences under
specific contexts have been found and examined. For example, candidate diphthongs
located between the members of compound words prefixed by a preposition do not
split. The automatic identification of these instances would be based on a morpholog-
ical analysis of words, a process beyond the scope of the present analysis.
2.2.2 Elimination of non-existent sequences. Having completed the vowel splitting
study, the question of whether all sequences presented in the rules of Table 2 exist
within acceptable Modern Greek words arises. Eliminations of consonant patterns ex-
ceeding a maximum length have already been discussed. Eliminations based on the
existence of certain vowel sequences may be possible. However, ancient Greek words
and borrowed foreign words that are frequently used in both written and spoken forms
contain additional sequences and, as has already been mentioned, their hyphenation is
governed by the same rules. Nevertheless, vowel sequences that contain consecutive
stressed vowels or double-vowel blends, or consecutive vowels with diaeresis marks
do not exist in any wordâpure Greek or loanâand thus this can be used as a general

elimination principle. The patterns fif2,fi,f2 E Vu 2V U VC of Lemma 6 contain exactly
301 such sequences. From the remaining vowel sequences of Lemma 6, a few may be
identified as non-existent. However, ad hoc compounds that can be readily created
may contain even those sequences. Mackridge (1987) notes that, unlike with English,
a person fluent in Greek has no difficulty in pronouncing an unknown word. This
holds for all vowel sequences in Greek independently of whether they exist within
acceptable words. It was thus decided to examine all theoretically possible cases and
not to eliminate a priori any sequences.

2.3 Degree of Hyphenation Completeness
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998628">
The rules in Tables 1 and 2 guarantee 100% correct hyphenation. The rules in Table 1
are capable of locating all permissible hyphenations of consonant sequences. In regard
to vowel sequences, set (V U 2V U VC) has 34 elements and according to Lemma 6
complete hyphenation of vowel sequences depends on 342 = 1,156 vowel sequences.
Grammar rules V1 and V2 explicitly define 16 of these, namely the elements of sets
2V and VC, while grammar books refer to 8 diphthongs that never split. Hence, only
16 + 8 = 24 sequences were initially non-ambiguous, while 1,156 â 24 = 1,132 were
ambiguous. Rules F1-F11 (Table 2) resolve the ambiguity of 1,015 different patterns.
(Occurrences of overlapping patterns have been eliminated by analytically calculat-
ing the intersection of the sets of patterns for all pairs of rules F1-F11). In general,
1,156 â 24 â 1,015 = 117 remain ambiguous. Thus, these rules are capable of com-
pletely hyphenating at least (1,015 + 24/1,156)*100 = 89.9% of the 1,156 sequences.
(If non-existent patterns were eliminated, i.e., those consisting of either two consecu-
tive stressed vowels or of two consecutive vowels with diaeresis marks, the degree of
completeness of the hyphenator on a vowel pattern basis could be then computed as:
(1,029â 301)/(1,156 â 301)*100 = 85.2%). Taking into account rule F12, which resolves
ambiguity by proposing additional hyphen points under specific contexts, the degree
of completeness increases. Furthermore, the ambiguity of additional sequences can be
resolved without proposing additional hyphens, by using the rule stating that stress
cannot be applied to a syllable beyond the antepenultimate position.
The degree of completeness calculated above does not represent completeness in
terms of hyphenated words of real text corpora. The degree of complete hyphenated
words of newspaper texts was manually calculated to be over 99%, as expected, be-
cause the frequency of occurrence of the remaining ambiguous vowel sequences in
words of real texts is relatively low.

In the previous sections, hyphenation issues were examined as they pertain to Mod-
ern Greek with the goal of achieving machine hyphenation that is both accurate and
complete to the highest degree possible.
Existing hyphenators for Greek are commercial products and usually work on a
minimal basis, i.e., finding the hyphen points of consonant sequences and, in lim-
ited cases, hyphens of vowel sequences. A research-based version of the Greek TEX
typesetting system (Knuth 1986) provides improved hyphenation, but it only indi-
cates splitting for 7.1% of the vowel sequences, which seem to have been selected
rather intuitively. Furthermore, three of the sequences, as was observed, can generate
impermissible hyphens.
The rules presented here have been used for the development of a hyphenator
program included in the Microsoft Word for Windows 6.0 and 7.0 (Greek version) al-
ready on the market. The system has also been ported to different platforms including

Lotus AmiPro and a specialized typesetting system of a major Greek newspaper. The
formal rules and the exact definitions of the sets of vowel and consonant sequences
compiled in Tables 1 and 2 are sufficient to implement the hyphenator program. Pat-
terns in Table 2 constitute maximal vowel tokens, which can be derived by a lexical
analysis process, while patterns in Table 1 consist of single vowels and consonants.
The hyphenator program comprises two parts: the lexical analyzer and the actual
hyphenator. The lexical analyzer reads the input characters and produces as output a
sequence of maximal V. 2V and VC tokens, as well as tokens of the maximal consonant
sequences of the word. For all tokens, the absolute starting position of the token in
the input word is maintained, while the length of each token is implicitly defined by
the token itself. All consonant tokens are also subdivided according to whether their
two character prefix is contained in the CC set or not. Nontrivial consonant sequences
are also designated by a flag indicating the occurrence of a p Er] suffix.
Vowel tokens are further classified according to the nearby resident vowel and
consonant tokens. No additional classification of vowel tokens is needed in the fol-
lowing cases: (i) vowel tokens not in the IU U set; (ii) vowel tokens that appear between
any consonant sequences; (iii) stressed vowel tokens in the I U U set that have as a left
neighbor a consonant sequence with an In suffix; (iv) vowel tokens that simultane-
ously have stress and diaeresis marks. The remaining vowel tokens are characterized
explicitly as stressed I, nonstressed I, and U.
The actual hyphenation phase follows, where the hyphenator traverses the token
sequence, identifies all ordered sequences of type (a) (vowel token) - (consonant token)
- (vowel token), and (b) (vowel token) - (vowel token), and applies the corresponding
hyphenation rules. The resulting hyphen points are given in terms of the absolute
starting position in the word of the first or the second token of the sequence currently
being examined.

3.1 Hyphenation of Words in Uppercase
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999979235294118">
There is no one-to-one correspondence between uppercase and lowercase letters. The
main difference is that stress markings are not applied to words whose letters are all
written in capitals while the diaeresis mark is maintained in capital letters.&apos; Conse-
quently, the transformation of any uppercase word to lowercase and back to uppercase
again loses no information. The opposite transformation is not always without loss
of information. To decrease the complexity of the hyphenator, we used only lower-
case patterns. Thus, uppercase words are transformed to lowercase, hyphenated, and
transformed back to uppercase forms.&amp;quot;
Hyphenation patterns of consonant sequences (Table 1) are unchanged because
consonants do not take stress marks and, moreover, the vowels contained in these
patterns are independent of stress. On the other hand, many of the patterns derived
for the hyphenation of vowel sequences cannot be applied to capitalized words be-
cause the most important discriminating factor in diphthong identification is stress
marking, and uppercase letters (Section 2.2.1) lack stress markings. This observation
certainly implies the tendency for words in uppercase to have fewer hyphens than
their lowercase equivalents. This inconsistency cannot be resolved without additional
information about the position of the stress mark.

Overall, it was feasible to make an analytical examination of the hyphenating sys-
tem mainly because most of the known hyphenation properties were expressed or
could be expressed in terms of orthographic representation. In Greek, this representa-
tion contains much of the pronunciation information, which is the ultimate basis for
hyphenation in every language. When analytical work reached the point where the
available data could no longer provide the necessary pronunciation information, it
was replaced by empirical work.
A similar process would be difficult to conceive in languages in which the or-
thography and pronunciation are significantly different. It should perhaps be stated
that the system itself may not have the capacity to be generalized to other languages.
It is interesting to note that rules governing the splitting of subword patterns exist
in languages such as English, but their application is usually determined by ortho-
graphically inexplicit information, such as the existence of a long, short, or stressed
vowel in some position of the pattern. Different types of properties typical of such
languages as English and German are based on morphological considerations that
were not an issue for our system. For example, in English &amp;quot;common roots&amp;quot; is an issue
in hyphenation of compounds, whereas in Greek, it is not. Such properties are not
likely to be similarly expressed in a pattern-based model. The process of developing a
similarly performing hyphenator for such languages would be different. Identification
of certain patterns would presumably be based on an empirical rather than an ana-
lytical process. Automatic extraction of common hyphenating properties from on-line
hyphenated dictionaries is known (Liang 1983). The resulting patterns tend to be more
detailed and extended. Lists of exceptions seem to be obligatory in such an approach
because their lack would lead to the generation of impermissible hyphens.

Grammar rules are interpreted and formally expressed in terms of regular expressions of word substrings, and exact hyphenation rules are derived. Vowel splitting, which traditionally is indicated in terms of prohibitive rather than explicit grammar rules, is examined in detail. Many ambiguities caused by circular definitions of the prohibitive rule vowel sequences are detected, an overwhelming majority of which are resolved within the present framework.</abstract>

It presents additional heuristic rules discovered during an exhaustive search of ambiguous vowel patterns, and demonstrates the degree of the resolved ambiguity in terms of the number of vowel sequences that have been disambiguated. Implementation issues are discussed, as well as the problem of words written in uppercase letters. Finally, the paper outlines the potential for generalization to other languages. 2. Hyphenation Rules 2.1 Consonant Splitting According to KEME (1983)1, the splitting of a Modern Greek word into syllables is governed by the following rules: Cl. A single consonant between two vowels is hyphenated with the succeeding vowel. C2. A sequence of two consonants between two vowels is hyphenated with the succeeding vowel, if a Greek word exists that begins with such a consonant sequence. Otherwise the sequence is split into two syllables. C3. A sequence of three or more consonants between two vowels is hyphenated with the succeeding vowel, if a Greek word exists that begins with the sequence of the first two consonants. Otherwise it splits; the firs</context>

Thus, c1[c2] is degenerated to cl, while c1 E C by definition, and hence [c2c*c31v2 are always hyphenated as 01 - c1[c2c*c3]02. The remaining strings are 01c1c2[c*c3]02, and, as indicated by C2 and C3, their hyphen point is the point preceding c1 if c1c2 E CC or the point between c1 and c2 otherwise. 2 Some books state that three consonant sequences, namely pit, UT, and -ye (/b/, /d/, /g/) are excluded from set CC under specific contexts, see for example, paragraph 81, note 4 of Trantafillidis (1941) and paragraphs 140, and 141 of Tsopanakis (1994). The official grammar book (KEME 1983) however, does not treat these sequences as exceptional. 364 Noussia Hyphenator for Modern Greek Theorem 2 The points immediately preceding 01 and immediately following v2 in the strings of expression vici [c2c*c3]v2 do not necessarily constitute permissible hyphen points. Proof Suppose that grammar rules indicate that the points immediately preceding 01 and immediately following v2 are also permissible hyphen points. By further taking into account Theorem 1, the assumption is that vici [c2c*c3]v2 is hyphenated either as -01 - ci [c2c*c3]v2 -, or exclusively as - v1c1 - [c2c*c3]v2 A hyphen is </context>

Word hyphenation could be bypassed by stretching out this space, but this would effect the appearance of the document. A hyphenator program takes as input a word and returns the set of points within the word where hyphens are permissible. Word hyphenation depends strictly on the target natural language, and many of the problems encountered are language specific. In general, machine hyphenation can be achieved either by consulting lists of hyphenated words or by developing pattern-based hyphenation programs (Liang 1983; Knuth 1986). The first approach ensures complete and correct hyphenation, but it has the disadvantage of being incapable of hyphenating words not on the list. In particular, for highly inflectional languages, such as Greek, these word lists would have to be extremely extensive in order to include all possible inflectional and derivational word forms. Even if such lists could be generated, it would be impossible to include words such as compounds, which can be readily created, or all proper names.

The requirement specifications are defined as follows: (i) to strictly prohibit impermissible hyphen generation; (ii) to generate a hyphen list that is as complete as possible. Existing hyphenator programs meet the first requirement either by decreasing the number of proposed hyphens or by establishing stop lists containing the appropriately hyphenated exceptional words. Commonly, fulfilling the second requirement depends on the development of extensive subword patterns associated with hyphenation rules, as in Liang 1983, for example.

The single-stress system imposed on Modern Greek in the last decade, states that &amp;quot;if the absence of the diaeresis mark does not generate ambiguity the mark should be eliminated&amp;quot; (Mackridge 1987, 93).

Nevertheless, vowel sequences that contain consecutive stressed vowels or double-vowel blends, or consecutive vowels with diaeresis marks do not exist in any wordâpure Greek or loanâand thus this can be used as a general 372 Noussia Hyphenator for Modern Greek elimination principle. The patterns fif2,fi,f2 E Vu 2V U VC of Lemma 6 contain exactly 301 such sequences. From the remaining vowel sequences of Lemma 6, a few may be identified as non-existent. However, ad hoc compounds that can be readily created may contain even those sequences. Mackridge (1987) notes that, unlike with English, a person fluent in Greek has no difficulty in pronouncing an unknown word. This holds for all vowel sequences in Greek independently of whether they exist within acceptable words. It was thus decided to examine all theoretically possible cases and not to eliminate a priori any sequences. 2.3 Degree of Hyphenation Completeness The rules in Tables 1 and 2 guarantee 100% correct hyphenation.

The examination of consonant splitting has not set any restrictions on the maximum length or even on the existence of certain consonant sequences. The phthong sequences that Modern Greek permits are, however, restricted by principles of grammar that are assumed to be universal. In the case of consonants, these principles state that the maximal consonant sequence is four characters long, and the maximal consonant prefix and suffix of Greek words are three characters and one character long, respectively (Setatos 1971). If these principles had been used in the examination of consonant splitting, the set of all subword patterns of Table 1 would have been restricted to the set of expression vici [c2c3c41v2. Similarly, prefix and suffix consonant sequences would be restricted to .c1[c2c3] and c., respectively. Furthermore, restrictions of specific sequences not possible in Greek words would further confine these patterns. Loanwords sometimes challenge these principles.

Thus, c1[c2] is degenerated to cl, while c1 E C by definition, and hence [c2c*c31v2 are always hyphenated as 01 - c1[c2c*c3]02. The remaining strings are 01c1c2[c*c3]02, and, as indicated by C2 and C3, their hyphen point is the point preceding c1 if c1c2 E CC or the point between c1 and c2 otherwise. 2 Some books state that three consonant sequences, namely pit, UT, and -ye (/b/, /d/, /g/) are excluded from set CC under specific contexts, see for example, paragraph 81, note 4 of Trantafillidis (1941) and paragraphs 140, and 141 of Tsopanakis (1994). The official grammar book (KEME 1983) however, does not treat these sequences as exceptional. 364 Noussia Hyphenator for Modern Greek Theorem 2 The points immediately preceding 01 and immediately following v2 in the strings of expression vici [c2c*c3]v2 do not necessarily constitute permissible hyphen points. Proof Suppose that grammar rules indicate that the points immediately preceding 01 and immediately following v2 are also permissible hyphen points. By further taking into account Theorem 1, the assumption is that vici [c2c*c3]v2 is hyphenated either as -01 - ci [c2c*c3]v2 -, or exclusiv</context>

A more clear approach is proposed by Tsopanakis (1994, 39, 84) who states that Modern Greek diphthongs are made up of a semivowel or /u/ and a vowel or double-vowel blend.&apos; Although linguists do not always agree with the terminology, in order to avoid confusion, the simplified definition shall be usedânamely that in diphthongs the semivowel is on the right and in excessive diphthongs, on the left.&apos; Because semivowels are represented by vowel characters or double-vowel blends, the two categories overlap. In short, diphthong vowel sequences are suffixed with semivowels /i/ or /u/ and excessive diphthongs prefixed by an /i/ or /u/ semivowel. The se</context>

This hyphenation, however, resulted in certain words whose stress appeared on a syllable to the left of the antepenultimate position. Apparently then, incorrect hyphenation had been applied. All diphthong and excessive diphthong candidates included in these words were collected and designated nonsplitting sequences. For the remaining candidates, identification of particular categories of substrings where a general exclusion rule may apply was attempted. Disparate and sometimes contradictory views given in various books (Setatos 1971; Triantafillidis 1978; Petrounias 1984; Mackridge 1987; Tsopanakis 1994) were collected. Their integrity was extensively examined through selection of matching words found in the corpus and in 370 Noussia Hyphenator for Modern Greek the lexicon. This empirical process resulted in formally expressed rules independent of any exceptions. The sets of categories found are not necessarily disjoint, whereas all overlaps always lead to consistent hyphenation. All categories found are explained below, and representative hyphenated examples along with IPA transcriptions and translations are given. In order to avoid confusion, hyphenation is applied to those vowel sequences </context>

There is a different rule for determining the splitting of excessive diphthongs, referred to by both Triantafillidis (1978, 38) and Tsopanakis (1994, 108). It concerns the natural semantics of excessive diphthongs; the avoidance of hiatus in the spoken language. If the flow of speech is constrained by the existence of additional &amp;quot;difficult&amp;quot; or complex phthongs, the pronunciation of the excessive diphthong in one syllable becomes impossible. One such case is that of at least a double-consonant sequence, whose second consonant is p [r] followed by a candidate excessive diphthong. That diphthong is not excessive and should always be split (rule F12, Table 2). It should be noted that additional rules covering additional vowel sequences under </context>
