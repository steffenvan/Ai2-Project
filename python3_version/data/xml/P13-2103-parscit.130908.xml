Stanford Dependencies (SD) provide a
functional characterization of the gram-
matical relations in syntactic parse-trees.
The SD representation is useful for parser
evaluation, for downstream applications,
and, ultimately, for natural language un-

novel extension of SD, called Unified-SD

create a new resource composed of U-SD-

Stanford Dependencies (SD) provide a functional
characterization of the grammatical relations in
syntactic trees, capturing the predicate-argument
structure of natural language sentences (de Marn-
effe et al., 2006). The SD representation proved
useful in a range of downstream tasks, includ-
ing Textual Entailments (Dagan et al., 2006) and
BioNLP (Fundel and Zimmer., 2007), and in re-
cent years SD structures have also become a de-
facto standard for parser evaluation in English (de
Marneffe and Manning, 2008a; Cer et al., 2010;
Nivre et al., 2010). Efforts now commence to-
wards extending SD for cross-lingual annotation
and evaluation (McDonald et al., 2013; Che et al.,
2012; Haverinen et al., 2011). By and large, these
efforts aim to remain as close as possible to the
original SD scheme. However, the original SD de-
sign emphasizes word-tokens and configurational
structures, and consequently, these schemes over-
look properties and realization patterns observed
in a range of languages known as Morphologically
Rich Languages (MRLs) (Tsarfaty et al., 2010).
MRLs use word-level affixes to express gram-
matical relations that are typically indicated by
structural positions in English. By virtue of
word-level morphological marking, word-order in
MRLs may be flexible. MRLs have been a fo-
cal point for the parsing community due to the
challenges that these phenomena pose for systems
originally developed for English.1 Here we argue
that the SD hierarchy and design principles simi-
larly emphasize English-like structures and under-
represent morphosyntactic argument-marking al-
ternatives. We define an extension of SD, called
Unified-SD (U-SD), which unifies the annotation
of structurally and morphologically marked rela-
tions via an inheritance hierarchy. We extend SD
with a functional branch, and provide a principled
treatment of morpho-syntactic argument marking.
Based on the U-SD scheme we create a new
parallel resource for the MRL Modern Hebrew,
whereby aligned constituency and dependency
trees reflect equivalent U-SD annotations (cf.
Rambow (2010)) for the same set of sentences. We
present two systems that can automatically learn
U-SD annotations, from the dependency and the
constituency versions respectively, delivering high
baseline accuracy on the prediction task.

2 The Challenge: SD for MRLs
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995412">
Stanford Dependencies (SD) (de Marneffe et al.,
2006; de Marneffe and Manning, 2008b) deliver a
functional representation of natural language sen-
tences, inspired by theoretical linguistic work such
as studies on Relational Grammars (Postal and
Perlmutter, 1977), Lexical Functional Grammars
(LFG) (Bresnan, 2000) and the PARC dependency
scheme (King et al., 2003). At the same time, the
scheme is designed with end-users in mind, allow-
ing them to utilize parser output in a form which
is intuitively interpretable and easily processed.
SD basic trees represent sentences as binary
relations between word tokens. These relations
are labeled using traditional grammatical concepts
(subject, object, modifier) that are arranged into an
inheritance hierarchy (de Marneffe and Manning,
2008a, Sec. 3). There are different versions of SD
annotations: the basic SD scheme, which anno-
tates surface dependency relations as a tree span-
ning all word tokens in the sentence, and the col-
lapsed SD version, in which function words (such
as prepositions) are collapsed and used for speci-
fying a direct relation between content words.
The SD scheme defines a core set of labels
and principles which are assumed to be useful
for different languages. However, a close exam-
ination of the SD label-set and inheritance hier-
archy reveals that some of its design principles
are geared towards English-like (that is, configu-
rational) phenomena, and conflict with basic prop-
erties of MRLs. Let us list three such design prin-
ciples and outline the challenges that they pose.
2.1. SD relate input-tokens. In MRLs, substan-
tial information is expressed as word affixes. One
or more morphemes may be appended to a content
word, and several morphemes may be contained in
a single space-delimited token. For example, the
Hebrew token wkfraiti2 in (1) includes the mor-
phemes w (and), kf (when) and raiti (saw); the lat-
ter segment is a content word, and the former two
are functional morphemes.

2.2. SD label structurally-marked relations.
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999929684210527">
Configurational languages like English use func-
tion words such as prepositions and auxiliaries
to indicate relations between content words and
to mark properties of complete structures. In
MRLs, such relations and properties may be indi-
cated by word-level morphological marking such
as case (Blake, 1994) and agreement (Corbett,
2006). In (1), for instance, the case marker at indi-
cates an accusative object relation between “see”
and “movie”, to be distinguished from, e.g, a da-
tive object. Moreover, the agreement in (1) on
the definite morpheme signals that “old” modifies
“movie”. While the original SD scheme label-set
covers function words (e.g. auxpass, expl, prep),
it misses labels for bound morphemes that mark
grammatical relations across languages (such as
accusative, dative or genitive). Explicit labeling of
such relational morphemes will allow us to benefit
from the information that they provide.

tural cues. SD relations are extracted from dif-
ferent types of trees for the purpose of, e.g., cross-
framework evaluation (Cer et al., 2010). Inso-
far, recovering SD relations from phrase-structure
(PS) trees have used a range of structural cues
such as positions and phrase-labels (see, for in-
stance, the software of de Marneffe and Manning
(2008a)). In MRLs, positions and phrase types
may not suffice for recovering SD relations: an
NP under S in Hebrew, for instance, may be a
subject or an object, as shown in Figure 1, and
morphological information then determines the
function of these constituents. Automatically in-
ferring predicate-argument structures across tree-
banks thus must rely on both structural and mor-
phological marking, calling for a single annotation
scheme that inter-relate the marking alternatives.

added a hd branch, for implicit head labels; (ii) added a func branch where all functional elements (prep,

3 The Proposal: Unified-SD (U-SD)
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999302277777778">
To address these challenges, we propose an exten-
sion of SD called Unified-SD (U-SD) which an-
notates relations between morphological segments
and reflects different types of argument-marking
patterns. The SD ontology is re-organized and ex-
tended to allow us to annotate morphologically-
and structurally-marked relations alike.
Preliminaries. We assume that M(w1...wn) =
s1....sm is a morphological analysis function that
identifies all morphological segments of a sen-
tence 5 = w1...wn. The U-SD scheme provides
the syntactic representation of 5 by means of a set
of triplets (l, si, sj) consisting of a label l, a head
si and a dependent sj (i =� j). The segments are
assumed to be numbered x.y where x is the posi-
tion of the input token, and y is the position of the
segment inside the token. The segmentation num-
bering is demonstrated in Example (1).
The U-SD Hierarchy. Figure 3 shows our pro-
posed U-SD hierarchy. Everything in the ontol-
ogy is of type gf (grammatical function). We
define five ontological sub-types: root, hd, dep,
func, punct. The root marks a special root de-
pendency. The dep branch is used for depen-
dent types, and it retains much of the structure in
the original SD scheme (separating sbj types, obj
types, mod types, etc.). The new func branch con-
tains argument-marking elements, that is, function
words and morphemes that play a role in indicat-
ing properties or grammatical relations in the syn-
tactic representation. These functional elements
may be of types marker (prepositions and case),
aux (auxiliary verbs and copular elements) and sub
(subordination/conjunction markers). All inher-
ited func elements may be consumed (henceforth,
collapsed) in order to infer grammatical proper-
ties and relations between content words. Head
types are implicit in dependency triplets, however,
when decorating PS trees with dependency labels
as dash features or edge features (as in TigerXML
formats (Brants et al., 2002) or via unification-
based formalisms) both heads and dependents are
labeled with their grammatical types (see Fig-
ure 2(a)). The hd branch extends the scheme with
an inventory of argument-taking elements, to be
used when employing SD inside constituency tree-
banks. The punct branch is reserved for punctu-
ation, prosody and other non-verbal speech acts.
The complete ontology is given in the appendix.
Annotation Guidelines. Anderson (1992) de-
lineates three kinds of properties that are realized
by morphology: structural, inherent, and agree-
ment properties. Structural properties (e.g., case)
are marked on a content word to indicate its rela-

tion to other parts of the sentence. Inherent prop-
erties (gender, number, etc.) indicate inherent se-
mantic properties of nominals. Agreement prop-
erties indicate the semantic properties of nominals
on top of other elements (verbs, adjectives, etc.),
in order to indicate their relation to the nominals.
We define annotation guidelines that reflect
these different properties. Structural morphemes
(case) connect words in the arc-structure, linking
a head to its semantic dependent, like the case
marker “at”-ACC in Figure 2(b). Inherent / agree-
ment properties are annotated as dependents of the
content word they add properties to, for instance,
the prefixes def in Figure 2(b) hang under the mod-
ified noun and adjective.
Collapsed U-SD structures interpret func ele-
ments in order to refine the representation of re-
lations between content words. Case markers can
be used for refining the relation between the con-
tent words they connect by labeling their direct re-
lation, much like prep in the original SD scheme
(see, e.g., the ACC-obj in Figure 2c). Inher-
ent/agreement features are in fact features of their
respective head word (as the X.DEF nodes in Fig-
ure 2c).3 Auxiliaries may further be used to add
tense/aspect to the main predicate, and subordina-
tors may propagate information inside the struc-
ture (much like conjunction is propagated in SD).
Universal Aspects of U-SD. The revised U-
SD ontology provides a typological inventory
of labels that describe different types of argu-
ments (dep), argument-taking elements (hd), and
argument-marking elements (func) in the grammar
of different languages. Abstract (universal) con-
cepts reside high in the hierarchy, and more spe-
cific distinctions, e.g., morphological markers of
particular types, are daughters within more spe-
cific branches. Using U-SD for evaluating mono-
lingual parsers is best done with the complete label
set relevant for that language. For cross-language
evaluation, we can limit the depth of the hierar-
chy, and convert the more specific notions to their
most-specific ancestor in the evaluation set.
3Technically, this is done by deleting a line adding a prop-
erty to the morphology column in the CoNLL format.

4 Automatic Annotation of U-SD Trees
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.952566465116279">
Can U-SD structures be automatically predicted?
For MRLs, this requires disambiguating both mor-
phological and syntactic information. Here we
employ the U-SD scheme for annotating mor-
phosyntactic structures in Modern Hebrew, and
use these resources to train two systems that pre-
dict U-SD annotations for raw texts.4
Data. We use the Modern Hebrew treebank
(Sima’an et al., 2001), a corpus of 6220 sentences
morphologically segmented and syntactically an-
alyzed as PS trees. We infer the function label
of each node in the PS trees based on the mor-
phological features, syntactic environment, and
dash-feature (if exist), using deterministic gram-
mar rules (Glinert, 1989). Specifically, we com-
pare each edge with a set of templates, and, once
finding a template that fits the morphological and
syntactic profile of an edge, we assign functions
to all daughters. This delivers PS trees where each
node is annotated with a U-SD label (Figure 2a).
At a second stage we project the inferred labels
onto the arcs of the unlabeled dependency trees of
Goldberg (2011), using the tree unification opera-
tion of Tsarfaty et al. (2012a). The result is a de-
pendency tree aligned with the constituency tree
where dependency arcs are labeled with the same
function as the respective span in the PS tree.5
Systems. We present two systems that predict
U-SD labels along with morphological and syn-
tactic information, using [DEP], a dependency
parser (Nivre et al., 2007), and [RR], a Relational-
Realizational (RR) constituency parser (Tsarfaty
and Sima’an, 2008). DEP is trained directly on the
dependency version of the U-SD resource. Since
it cannot predict its own segmentation, automatic
segments and tags are predicted using the system
of Adler and Elhadad (2006). The constituency-
4Despite significant advances in parsing Hebrew, as of yet
there has been no functional evaluation of Hebrew parsers.
E.g., Goldberg and Elhadad (2010) evaluate on unlabeled de-
pendencies, Tsarfaty (2010) evaluate on constituents. This is
largely due to the lack of standard resources and guidelines
for annotating functional structures in such a language.

based model is trained on U-SD-labeled RR trees
using Petrov et al. (2006). We use the lattice-based
extension of Goldberg and Elhadad (2011) to per-
form joint segmentation and parsing. We evalu-
ate three input scenarios: [Gold] gold segmen-
tation and gold tags, [Predicted] gold segments,
and [Raw] raw words. We evaluate parsing results
with respect to basic U-SD trees, for 42 labels. We
use TedEval for joint segmentation-tree evaluation
(Tsarfaty et al., 2012b) and follow the cross-parser
evaluation protocol of Tsarfaty et al. (2012a).
Results. Since this work focuses on creating a
new resource, we report results on the standard
devset (Table 1). The gold input scenarios ob-
tain higher accuracy on function labels in all cases,
since gold morphological analysis delivers disam-
biguated functions almost for free. Constituency-
based RR structures obtain better accuracy on U-
SD annotations than the respective dependency
parser. All in all, the U-SD seed we created allows
us to infer rich interpretable annotations automati-
cally for raw text, using either a dependency parser
or a constituency parser, in good accuracy.

The contribution of this paper is three-fold. We of-
fer a principled treatment of annotating MRLs via
a Unified-SD scheme, which we design to be ap-
plicable to many languages. We deliver new U-SD
annotated resources for the MRL Modern Hebrew,
in different formal types. We finally present two
systems that automatically predict U-SD annota-
tions for raw texts. These structures are intended
to serve semantic applications. We further intend
to use this scheme and computational frameworks
to serve a wide cross-parser investigation on infer-
ring functional structures across languages.

<abstract confidence="0.999462">Stanford Dependencies (SD) provide a functional characterization of the grammatical relations in syntactic parse-trees. The SD representation is useful for parser evaluation, for downstream applications, and, ultimately, for natural language understanding, however, the design of SD focuses on structurally-marked relations and under-represents morphosyntactic realization patterns observed in Morphologically Rich Languages (MRLs). We present a novel extension of SD, called Unified-SD (U-SD), which unifies the annotation of structurallyand morphologically-marked relations via an inheritance hierarchy. We create a new resource composed of U-SDannotated constituency and dependency treebanks for the MRL Modern Hebrew, and present two systems that can automatically predict U-SD annotations, for gold segmented input as well as raw texts, with high baseline accuracy.</abstract>

At the same time, the scheme is designed with end-users in mind, allowing them to utilize parser output in a form which is intuitively interpretable and easily processed. SD basic trees represent sentences as binary relations between word tokens. These relations are labeled using traditional grammatical concepts (subject, object, modifier) that are arranged into an inheritance hierarchy (de Marneffe and Manning, 2008a, Sec. 3).

We use the Modern Hebrew treebank (Sima’an et al., 2001), a corpus of 6220 sentences morphologically segmented and syntactically analyzed as PS trees. We infer the function label of each node in the PS trees based on the morphological features, syntactic environment, and dash-feature (if exist), using deterministic grammar rules (Glinert, 1989). Specifically, we compare each edge with a set of templates, and, once finding a template that fits the morphological and syntactic profile of an edge, we assign functions to all daughters. This delivers PS trees where each node is annotated with a U-SD label (Figure 2a).

The SD representation proved useful in a range of downstream tasks, including Textual Entailments (Dagan et al., 2006) and BioNLP (Fundel and Zimmer., 2007), and in recent years SD structures have also become a defacto standard for parser evaluation in English (de Marneffe and Manning, 2008a; Cer et al., 2010; Nivre et al., 2010). Efforts now commence towards extending SD for cross-lingual annotation and evaluation (McDonald et al., 2013; Che et al., 2012; Haverinen et al., 2011). By and large, these efforts aim to remain as close as possible to the original SD scheme. However, the original SD design emphasizes word-tokens and configurational structures, and consequently, these schemes overlook properties and realization patterns observed in a range of languages known as Morphologically Rich Languages (MRLs) (Tsarfaty et al., 2010). MRLs use word-level affixes to express grammatical relations that are typically indicated by structural positions in English. By virtue of word-level morphological marking, word-order in MRLs may be flexible. MRLs have been a focal point f</context>

We define an extension of SD, called Unified-SD (U-SD), which unifies the annotation of structurally and morphologically marked relations via an inheritance hierarchy. We extend SD with a functional branch, and provide a principled treatment of morpho-syntactic argument marking. Based on the U-SD scheme we create a new parallel resource for the MRL Modern Hebrew, whereby aligned constituency and dependency trees reflect equivalent U-SD annotations (cf. Rambow (2010)) for the same set of sentences. We present two systems that can automatically learn U-SD annotations, from the dependency and the constituency versions respectively, delivering high baseline accuracy on the prediction task. 1See also the SPMRL line of workshops https:// sites.google.com/site/spsemmrl2012/ and the MT-MRL workshop http://cl.haifa.ac.il/MT/. 578 Proceedings of the 51st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 578–584, Sofia, Bulgaria, August 4-9 2013. c�2013 Association for Computational Linguistics 2 The Challenge: SD for MRLs Stanford Dependencies</context>
