Repair processing plays an important role in
spoken language processing systems. This
paper proposes a method for correcting
Chinese repetition repairs and demonstrates
the effects of repair processing in Chinese
homophone disambiguation. The
experimental results show that the precision
rate of 93.87% and the recall rate of 90.65%
can be achieved for the repair processing.
At the same time, 50% of errors in the
repairing segments can be reduced for
Chinese homophone disambiguation.

<bodyText confidence="0.9997534">
Repair is a very common phenomenon in spoken
languages. Speakers usually repeat, add, replace, or
even abandon some constructions in the utterances for
some mental reasons. Typical repairs in Chinese
spoken data&apos; are shown in (1) and (2).

Heeman and Allen (1994) describe that 25% of
turns contain at least one speech repair in their corpus.
In our study, 17% of turns contain at least one speech
repair. Thus, the repair processing cannot be
negligible and has influences to a certain extent.
Recently, text-first approach and speech-first
approach have been proposed to touch on repairs in
English. The text-first approach assumes the speech
recognizer could provide a correct transcription. That
is, it tries to detect and correct speech repairs
automatically using text alone. Hindle (1983) adds
rules to a deterministic parser to tackle the problem of
correcting speech repairs. His parsing strategy
depends on the successful disambiguation of the
syntactic categories. Although syntactic categories
can be determined well by local context, Hindle admits
that speech repair disrupts the local context. Bear, et
al. (1992) firstly try to parse the input sentence and
then invoke a repair processing when the parsing fails.
For repair processing, a simple pattern matcher finds
the candidates based on the lexical cues at the first
stage. Then the syntactic and semantic processing
filters out the impossible candidates. Heeman and
Allen (1994) present an algorithm that detects and
corrects modification and abridged repairs. The
algorithm uses some repair patterns to capture potential
repairs. These patterns are built based on the
identification of word fragments, editing terms&apos;, and
word correspondences between the repaired segment

Second, Chinese repairs may not always have an

not have much effect in Chinese repair processing.
Third, duplicate constructions (e.g., g Xi* (bang 1
bang 1 mang2, help), WARR (yan2 jiu4 yan2 jiu4,
study)) generated by repeating words or phrases in
Chinese utterances are used very often, but they do not
always initiate a repair. That is, a simple pattern
matching mechanism cannot be workable. Forth, the
Chinese speech repairs may be initiated at various
syntactic environment (Chui, 1995), e.g., before the
subject, during the subject, after the subject and before
the verb, during the verb, during a direct object, during
a prepositional phrase, during subordination, and so on.
The variety makes the identification of Chinese speech
repairs more troublesome.
Because the repairs introduce much noise in
language processing, we cannot defer the task of repair
processing to the latter stages. This paper employs
acoustic and prosodic information to correct Chinese
repetition repairs. The results are applied to Chinese
homophone disambiguation. Section 2 defines four
major types of speech repairs. Section 3 introduces
the spoken corpus. Sections 4 and 5 describe the

<bodyText confidence="0.99994725">
Because the repetition repairs form the majority, we
focus on the repetition repairs in this paper. Although
the repetition repairs have the simple surface form,
correcting such a kind of speech repairs is not trivial.
That is, a simple pattern matching mechanism cannot
work perfectly. Table 2 explains this point. A repair
is proposed when a string of syllables repeats within an
utterance or between two consecutive utterances.

Columns 2, 3 and 4 denote the total repetition repairs,
the number of repairs proposed by the simple pattern
matcher and the number of correct proposed repairs,
respectively. For example, 243 repairs are proposed
by the simple pattern matcher in conversation 1, but
only 118 of them are correct. That is, there are 125
false alarms. Since there are 122 repetition repairs in
conversation 1, 4 repetition repairs are not captured.
They are all English repairs. Because only Chinese
repairs are considered, English repairs are lost.
Although this technique can achieve recall rate of
97.82%, it has a relatively low precision rate, i.e.,
47.94%.
Since the simple pattern matching mechanism
cannot solve this problem properly, two additional cues
are firstly considered in the baseline model: the length
of the repeated syllable string and the number of inter-
utterances.
6 Because we focus our efforts on correcting speech repairs, the
identification of acoustic and prosodic cues does not discuss in this
paper.

4.2 The Length of the Repeated Syllable
String
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999588">
How many syllables are repeated in the repetition
repairs is an interesting problem in cognition. Table 3
lists the distribution of length of the repeated syllable
strings in the repetition repairs.

The length ranges from I to 4. Thus, when a string of
syllables repeats and the length of this string is greater

4.3 The Number of Inter-Utterances
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999940428571429">
In human conversation, most of the repetition repairs
occur within an utterance or between two consecutive
utterances of one speaker without interrupting by other
speakers. That is, if many utterances issued by other
speakers are inserted between two utterances of the
same speaker, the repetition repairs usually do not
occur. The spoken corpus shows this point.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9043075">
• Total 13.69% of repetition repairs occur in the
same utterance.
• Total 71.66% of repetition repairs occur
between two consecutive utterances without
interrupting by other speakers.
• Only 0.32% of repetition repairs occur across
more than 3 utterances issued by other
speakers.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999189">
According to the heuristic rule, when more than 3
utterances pronounced by other speakers interrupt the
speech of a speaker, we do not check whether there is a
repetition repair or not.

Glottal stop has the similar functions to unfilled pause.
That is, a glottal stop may occur between the repaired

repairs, whereas actual repeated characters usually do
not have such a marker between them. (1) is an
example. Table 5 shows the results when the glottal
stop information is used to enhance the baseline model.

From Table 5, we find that glottal stop is a more
reliable cue than unfilled pause, but it does not occur as
frequently as unfilled pause. These points are verified
by the high precision rate (97.41%) and the low recall
rate (35.20%). When the unfilled pause information
and the glottal stop information are all applied to the
baseline model, the experimental results for two

<bodyText confidence="0.999967571428571">
If two consecutive utterances are equal, repetition
repairs usually do not occur within and between them
when the length of the utterances is long enough. This
is because the matched string usually denotes an
emphasis when it is long enough. This cue can
eliminate some implausible repairs, so that the
precision rate can be increased.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.996765">
5.4 Cue Patterns
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999135208333333">
In Chinese conversation, some words or phrases are
frequently repeated, but they are not repairs. Typical
examples are interjections (e.g., %ilk (o2, oh)) and
phrase-final particles (e.g., °M- (a5, a)). These
patterns called type I cue patterns are used to increase
the precision rate. That is, a repair is proposed when a
string of syllables repeats, satisfies the criteria of
baseline model, unfilled pause and glottal stop, and the
first syllable of the string does not belong to type I cue
patterns.
In contrast to type I cue patterns, another kind of
patterns, type II cue patterns, are also considered to
increase the recall rate. That is, some repeated
syllable strings that do not satisfy the criteria of unfilled
pause and glottal stop, but they are usually repetition
repairs. Typical examples are pronouns such as A
(wo3, I) and 11: (ni3, you). Based on type II cue
patterns, some additional repairs can be proposed when
a string of syllables repeats, it does not satisfy the
criteria of unfilled pause and glottal stop, but the first
syllable of the string belongs to type II cue patterns.
When all the cues proposed in the previous
subsections are all applied to the baseline model, the
final experimental results are listed in Table 7.

Homophone Disambiguation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9867761">
Mandarin Chinese has approximately 1,300 syllables,
13,094 commonly used characters, and more than
100,000 words. Each character is pronounced as a
syllable and many syllables are shared by several
characters. Some syllables correspond to even more
than 100 characters. Thus, Chinese homophone
disambiguation is difficult but important in a Chinese
phonetic input method and a Chinese speech
recognition system.
The problem of Chinese homophone
disambiguation is defined as how to convert a sequence
of syllables S into the corresponding sequence of
characters-c&amp;quot; correctly. Thus, Chinese homophone
disambiguation can be regarded as a process of
conversion of syllable-to-character. Let S=&lt;s , s2,
53, sn&gt; be a syllable string and C=&lt;ci, c2, c3, cn&gt;
be one corresponding character string. Here, si
denotes one of 1,300 Chinese syllables and ci denotes
one of 13,094 Chinese characters. The conversion can
be formulated as follows.

Any spoken language systems will not perform well
without treating speech repairs. Correcting speech
repairs make more reliable environments for the
subsequent processing. This paper employs acoustic
and prosodic cues to correct the repetition repairs.

disfluencies reduces perplexity.
9 The Academia Sinica Balance Corpus (1995) is adopted as the
training corpus in this experiment. It contains text of several
categories and includes approximately 360,000 sentences comprising
of about 3,300,000 characters.

of 90.65%. At the same time, 50% of errors in the
repairing segment can be reduced for the Chinese
homophone disambiguation.
O&apos;Shaughnessy (1992) claims that most speech
repairs do not have lengthening prior to the hesitation
pause. If this cue is used in our model, it can slightly
increase the precision rate (95.37%), but the recall rate
(76.95%) is greatly decreased.
Although our method can perform well in
repetition repairs, other kinds of repairs such as
addition, replacement and abandon repairs are not
addressed in this paper. They have more complex
surface forms and should be investigated further.

This paper proposes a method for correcting Chinese repetition repairs and demonstrates the effects of repair processing in Chinese homophone disambiguation. The experimental results show that the precision rate of 93.87% and the recall rate of 90.65% can be achieved for the repair processing. At the same time, 50% of errors in the repairing segments can be reduced for Chinese homophone disambiguation.</abstract>
