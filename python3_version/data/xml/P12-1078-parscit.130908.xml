Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999789956521739">
We propose a latent variable model to enhance
historical analysis of large corpora. This work
extends prior work in topic modelling by in-
corporating metadata, and the interactions be-
tween the components in metadata, in a gen-
eral way. To test this, we collect a corpus
of slavery-related United States property law
judgements sampled from the years 1730 to
1866. We study the language use in these
legal cases, with a special focus on shifts in
opinions on controversial topics across differ-
ent regions. Because this is a longitudinal
data set, we are also interested in understand-
ing how these opinions change over the course
of decades. We show that the joint learning
scheme of our sparse mixed-effects model im-
proves on other state-of-the-art generative and
discriminative models on the region and time
period identification tasks. Experiments show
that our sparse mixed-effects model is more
accurate quantitatively and qualitatively inter-
esting, and that these improvements are robust
across different parameter settings.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999932833333333">
Many scientific subjects, such as psychology, learn-
ing sciences, and biology, have adopted computa-
tional approaches to discover latent patterns in large
scale datasets (Chen and Lombardi, 2010; Baker and
Yacef, 2009). In contrast, the primary methods for
historical research still rely on individual judgement
and reading primary and secondary sources, which
are time consuming and expensive. Furthermore,
traditional human-based methods might have good
precision when searching for relevant information,
but suffer from low recall. Even when language
technologies have been applied to historical prob-
lems, their focus has often been on information re-
trieval (Gotscharek et al., 2009), to improve acces-
sibility of texts. Empirical methods for analysis and
interpretation of these texts is therefore a burgeoning
new field.
Court opinions form one of the most important
parts of the legal domain, and can serve as an excel-
lent resource to understand both legal and political
history (Popkin, 2007). Historians often use court
opinions as a primary source for constructing in-
terpretations of the past. They not only report the
proceedings of a court, but also express a judges’
views toward the issues at hand in a case, and reflect
the legal and political environment of the region and
period. Since there exists many thousands of early
court opinions, however, it is difficult for legal his-
torians to manually analyze the documents case by
case. Instead, historians often restrict themselves to
discussing a relatively small subset of legal opinions
that are considered decisive. While this approach
has merit, new technologies should allow extraction
of patterns from large samples of opinions.
Latent variable models, such as latent Dirichlet al-
location (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003) and probabilistic
latent semantic analysis (PLSA) (Hofmann, 1999),
have been used in the past to facilitate social science
research. However, they have numerous drawbacks,
as many topics are uninterpretable, overwhelmed by
uninformative words, or represent background lan-
guage use that is unrelated to the dimensions of anal-
ysis that qualitative researchers are interested in.
SAGE (Eisenstein et al., 2011a), a recently pro-
posed sparse additive generative model of language,
addresses many of the drawbacks of LDA. SAGE
assumes a background distribution of language use,
and enforces sparsity in individual topics. Another
advantage, from a social science perspective, is that
SAGE can be derived from a standard logit random-
utility model of judicial opinion writing, in contrast
to LDA. In this work we extend SAGE to the su-
pervised case of joint region and time period pre-
diction. We formulate the resulting sparse mixed-
effects (SME) model as being made up of mixed
effects that not only contain random effects from
sparse topics, but also mixed effects from available
metadata. To do this we augment SAGE with two
sparse latent variables that model the region and
time of a document, as well as a third sparse latent

variable that captures the interactions among the re-
gion, time and topic latent variables. We also intro-
duce a multiclass perceptron-style weight estimation
method to model the contributions from different
sparse latent variables to the word posterior prob-
abilities in this predictive task. Importantly, the re-
sulting distributions are still sparse and can therefore
be qualitatively analyzed by experts with relatively
little noise.
In the next two sections, we overview work re-
lated to qualitative social science analysis using la-
tent variable models, and introduce our slavery-
related early United States court opinion data. We
describe our sparse mixed-effects model for joint
modeling of region, time, and topic in section 4.
Experiments are presented in section 5, with a ro-
bust analysis from qualitative and quantitative stand-
points in section 5.2, and we discuss the conclusions

Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods for
automatically understanding and identifying key
information in historical data have not yet been
explored until recently. Related research efforts
include using the LDA model for topic model-
ing in historical newspapers (Yang et al., 2011),
a rule-based approach to extract verbs in histor-
ical Swedish texts (Pettersson and Nivre, 2011),
a system for semantic tagging of historical Dutch
archives (Cybulska and Vossen, 2011).
Despite our historical data domain, our approach
is more relevant to text classification and topic mod-
elling. Traditional discriminative methods, such as
support vector machine (SVM) and logistic regres-
sion, have been very popular in various text cate-
gorization tasks (Joachims, 1998; Wang and McKe-
own, 2010) in the past decades. However, the main
problem with these methods is that although they are
accurate in classifying documents, they do not aim
at helping us to understand the documents.
Another problem is lack of expressiveness. For
example, SVM does not have latent variables to
model the subtle differences and interactions of fea-
tures from different domains (e.g. text, links, and
date), but rather treats them as a “bag-of-features”.
Generative methods, by contrast, can show the
causes to effects, have attracted attentions in re-
cent years due to the rich expressiveness of the
models and competitive performances in predictive
tasks (Wang et al., 2011). For example, Nguyen et
al. (2010) study the effect of the context of inter-
action in blogs using a standard LDA model. Guo
and Diab (2011) show the effectiveness of using se-
mantic information in multifaceted topic models for
text categorization. Eisenstein et al. (2010) use a
latent variable model to predict geolocation infor-
mation of Twitter users, and investigate geographic
variations of language use. Temporally, topic mod-
els have been used to show the shift in language use
over time in online communities (Nguyen and Ros´e,
2011) and the evolution of topics over time (Shub-
hankar et al., 2011).
When evaluating understandability, however,
dense word distributions are a serious issue in many
topic models as well as other predictive tasks. Such
topic models are often dominated by function words
and do not always effectively separate topics. Re-
cent work have shown significant gains in both pre-
dictiveness and interpretatibility by enforcing spar-
sity, such as in the task of discovering sociolinguistic
patterns of language use (Eisenstein et al., 2011b).
Our proposed sparse mixed-effects model bal-
ances the pros and cons the above methods, aim-
ing at higher classification accuracies using the SME
model for joint geographic and temporal aspects pre-
diction, as well as richer interaction of components
from metadata to enhance historical analysis in legal
opinions. To the best of our knowledge, this study is
the first of its kind to discover region and time spe-
cific topical patterns jointly in historical texts.

We have collected a corpus of slavery-related United
States supreme court legal opinions from Lexis
Nexis. The dataset includes 5,240 slavery-related
state supreme court cases from 24 states, during the
period of 1730 - 1866. Optical character recognition
(OCR) software was used by Lexis Nexis to digitize
the original documents. In our region identification
task, we wish to identify whether an opinion was
written in a free state1 (R1) or a slave state (R2)2.
In our time identification experiment, we approx-
imately divide the legal documents into four time
quartiles (Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4), and predict which
quartile the testing document belongs to. Q1 con-
tains cases from 1837 or earlier, where as Q2 is for
1838-1848, Q3 is for 1849-1855, and Q4 is for 1856
and later.

constant background distribution m, and additively
models the sparse deviation η from the background
in log-frequency space. It also incorporates latent
variables τ to model the variance for each sparse de-
viation η. By enforcing sparsity, the model might be
less likely to overfit the training data, and requires
estimation of fewer parameters.
This paper further extends SAGE to analyze mul-
tiple facets of a document collection, such as the
regional and temporal differences. Figure 1 shows
the graphical model of our proposed sparse mixed-
effects (SME) model. In this SME model, we still
have the same Dirichlet α, the latent topic proportion
θ, and the latent topic variable z as the original LDA
model. For each document d, we are able to ob-
serve two labels: the region labely(R) dand the time
quartile label y(Q)
d . We also have a background dis-
tribution m that is drawn from a uninformative prior.
The three major sparse deviation latent variables are
ηk for topics, η(R)
(T) j for regions, and η(Q) qfor time
periods. All of the three latent variables are condi-
tioned on another three latent variables, which are
their corresponding variances τ(T )

j and τ(Q)
q .
In the intersection of the plates for topics, regions,
and time quartiles, we include another sparse latent
variable η(I)qjk, which is conditioned on a variance
τ(I)
qjk, to model the interactions among topic, region
and time. η(I)
qjk is the linear combination of time pe-
riod, region and topic sparse latent variables, which
absorbs the residual variation that is not captured in
the individual effects.
In contrast to traditional multinomial distribution
of words in LDA models, we approximate the con-
ditional word distribution in the document d as the
exponentiated sum β of all latent sparse deviations

Despite SME learns in a Bayesian framework, the

We follow the MAP estimation method that Eisen-
stein et al. (2011a) used to train all sparse latent vari-
ables η, and perform Bayesian inference on other la-
tent variables. The estimation of all variance vari-
ables τ remains as plugging the compound distri-
bution of Normal-Jeffrey’s prior, where the latter is
a replacement of the Exponential prior. When per-
forming Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm
to infer the latent variables in SME, we derive the
following likelihood function:

The above E step likelihood score can be intuitively
interpreted as the sum of topic proportion scores, la-
tent topic scores, the word scores, the η scores with
their priors, and minus the joint variance. In the M
step, when we use Newton’s method to optimize the
sparse deviation ηk parameter, we need to modify
the original likelihood function in SAGE and its cor-
responding first and second order derivatives when
deriving the gradient and Hessian matrix. The like-
lihood function for sparse topic deviation ηk is:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.977477">
G(ηk) = (c(T )

where c(T)
k is the true count, and βqjk is the log
word likelihood in the original likelihood function.
Cqjk is the expected count from combinations of
time, region and topic. Eq Ej (Cqjk)βqjk will then
be taken the second order derivative to form the Hes-
sian matrix, instead of (Ck)βk in the previous SAGE
setting.
To learn the weight parameters λ(R) and λ(Q),
we can approximate the weights using a multiclass
perceptron-style (Collins, 2002) learning method. If
we say that the notation of E V (¯R) is to marginalize
out all other variables in β except η(R), and P(y(R)

5 Prediction Experiments
We perform three quantitative experiments to evalu-
ate the predictive power of the sparse mixed-effects
model. In these experiments, to predict the region
and time peri
od labels of a given document, we

<bodyText confidence="0.999883535714286">
jointly learn the two labels in the SME model, and
choose the pair which maximizes the probability of
the document.
In the first experiment, we compare the prediction
accuracy of our SME model to a widely used dis-
criminative learner in NLP – the linear kernel sup-
port vector machine (SVM)3. In the second experi-
ment, in addition to the linear kernel SVM, we also
compare our SME model to a state-of-the-art sparse
generative model of text (Eisenstein et al., 2011a),
and vary the size of input vocabulary W exponen-
tially from 29 to the full size of our training vocab-
ulary4. In the third experiment, we examine the ro-
bustness of our model by examining how the number
of topics influences the prediction accuracy when
varying the K from 10 to 50.
Our data consists of 4615 training documents and
625 held-out documents for testing. While individ-
ual judges wrote multiple opinions in our corpus,
no judges overlapped between training and test sets.
When measuring by the majority class in the testing
condition, the chance baseline for the region iden-
tification task is 57.1% and the time identification
task is 32.3%. We use three-fold cross-validation to
infer the learning rate S and cost C hyperpriors in
the SME and SVM model respectively. We use the
paired student t-test to measure the statistical signif-
icance.

We show in this section the predictive power of

this setting was shown to yield a promising result in
a previous study (Eisenstein et al., 2011a) on sparse
topic models. In terms of the size of vocabulary W

of interpretability for social science research, the
choice of vocabulary size is critical to ensure un-
derstandable topics. Thus we report our results at
various vocabulary sizes W on SME and SAGE. To
better validate the performance of SME, we also in-
clude the performance of SVM in this experiment,
and fix the number of topics K = 10 for the SME
and SAGE models, which is a different value for the
number of topics K than the empirical K we used in
the experiment of Section 5.1.1. Figure 2 and Fig-
ure 3 show the experiment results in both time and
region classification task.
In Figure 2, we evaluate the impacts of W on our
time quartile prediction task. The advantage of the
SME model is very obvious throughout the experi-

sult at W = 213, where the relative improvement
over SAGE and SVM is 16.8% and 22.9% respec-
tively (p &lt; 0.001 under all comparisons).
Figure 3 shows the impacts of W on the accu-
racy of SAGE and SME in the region identification
task. In this experiment, the results of SME model
are in line with SAGE and SVM when the feature
space is dense. However, when W reaches the full
vocabulary size, we have observed significantly bet-
ter results (p &lt; 0.001 in the comparison to SAGE
and p &lt; 0.05 with SVM). We hypothesize that there
might be two reasons: first, the K parameter is set
to 10 in this experiment, which is much denser than
the experiment setting in Section 5.1.1. Under this
condition, the sparse topic advantage of SME might
be less salient. Secondly, in the two tasks, it is ob-
served that the accuracy of the binary region classi-
fication task is much higher than the four-way task,
thus while the latter benefits significantly from this
joint learning scheme of the SME model, but the for-
mer might not have the equivalent gain5.

Unlike hierarchical Dirichlet processes (Teh et al.,
2006), in parametric Bayesian generative models,
the number of topics K is often set manually, and
can influence the model’s accuracy significantly. In
this experiment, we fix the input vocabulary W to
29, and compare the mixed-effect model with SAGE
in both region and time identification tasks.
Figure 4 shows how the variations of K can in-
fluence the system performance in the time quartile
prediction task. We can see that the sparse mixed-
effects model (SME) reaches its best performance
when the K is 40. After increasing the number of
topics K, we can see SAGE consistently increase
its accuracy, obtaining its best result when K = 30.
When comparing these two models, SME’s best per-
formance outperforms SAGE’s with an absolute im-
provement of 3%, which equals to a relative im-
provement (p &lt; 0.001) of 8.4%. Figure 5 demon-
strates the impacts of K on the predictive power of
SME and SAGE in the region identification task.
the two tasks in SME have similar difficulties and accuracies,
but this needs to be verified in future work.

5.2 Qualitative Analysis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999968666666667">
In this section, we qualitatively evaluate the topics
generated vis-a-vis the secondary literature on the
legal and political history of slavery in the United
States. The effectiveness of SME could depend not
just on its predictive power, but also in its ability
to generate topics that will be useful to historians
of the period. Supreme court opinions on slavery
are of significant interest for American political his-
tory. The conflict over slave property rights was at
the heart of the “cold war” (Wright, 2006) between
North and South leading up to the U.S. Civil War.
The historical importance of this conflict between
Northern and Southern legal institutions is one of the
motivations for choosing our data domain.
We conduct qualitative analyses on the top-ranked
keywords6 that are associated with different geo-
graphical locations and different temporal frames,
generated by our SME model. In our analysis, for

</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.999973461538462">
each interaction of topic, region, and time period, a
list of the most salient vocabulary words was gener-
ated. These words were then analyzed in the context
of existing historical literature on the shift in atti-
tudes and views over time and across regions. Table
2 shows an example of relevant keywords and topics.
This difference between Northern and Southern
opinion can be seen in some of the topics generated
by the SME. Topic 1 deals with transfers of human
beings as slave property. The keyword “remainder-
man” designates a person who inherits or is entitled
to inherit property upon the termination of an es-
tate, typically after the death of a property owner,
and appears in Northern and Southern cases. How-
ever, in Topic 1 “runaway” appears as a keyword in
decisions from free states but not in decisions from
slave states. The fact that “runaway” is not a top
word in the same topic in the Southern legal opin-
ions is consistent with a spatial (geolocational) di-
vision in which the property claims of slave owners
over runaways were not heavily contested in South-
ern courts.
Topic 3 concerns bequests, as indicated by the
term “heir-at-law”, but again the term “manumis-
sions”, ceases to show up in the slave states after the
first time quartile, perhaps reflecting the hostility to
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.994305">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999022448979592">
manumissions that southern courts exhibited as the
conflict over slavery deepened.
Topic 4 concerns indentures and apprentices. In-
terestingly, the terms indentures and apprenticeships
are more prominent in the non-slave states, reflect-
ing the fact that apprenticeships and indentures were
used in many border states as a substitute for slavery,
and these were often governed by continued usage of
Master and Servant law (Orren, 1992).
Topic 5 shows the constitutional crisis in the
states. In particular, the anti-slavery state courts are
prone to use the term “unconstitutional” much more
often than the slave states. The word “man-trap”, a
term used to refer to states where free blacks could
be kidnapped purpose of enslaving them. The fugi-
tive slave conflicts of the mid-19th century that led
to the civil war were precisely about this aversion
of the northern states to having to return runaway
slaves to the Southern states.
Besides these subjective observations about the
historical significance of the SME topics, we also
conduct a more formal analysis comparing the SME
classification to that conducted by a legal histo-
rian. Wahl (2002) analyses and classifies by hand
10989 slave cases in the US South into 6 categories:
“Hires”, “Sales”, “Transfers”, “Common Carrier”,
“Black Rights” and “Other”. An example of “Hires”
is Topic 4. Topics 1, 2, and 3 concern “Transfers” of
slave property between inheritors, descendants and
heirs-at-law. Topic 5 would be classified as “Other”.
We take each of our 25 modelled topics and clas-
sify them along Wahl’s categories, using “Other”
when a classification could not be obtained. The
classifications are quite transparent in virtually all
cases, as certain words (such as “employer” or “be-
quest”) clearly designate certain categories (respec-
tively, such as “Hires” or “Transfers”). We then cal-
culate the probability of each of Wahl’s categories in
Region 2. We then compare these to the relative fre-
quencies of Wahl’s categorization in the states that
overlap with our Region 2 in Figure 6 and do a X2
test for goodness of fit, which allows us to reject dif-
ference at 0.1% confidence.
The SME model thus delivers topics that, at a first
pass, are consistent with the history of the period
as well as previous work by historians, showing the
qualitative benefits of the model. We plan to conduct
more vertical and temporal analyses using SME in
the future.

elling and extends that model to a setting where
metadata is available for analysis. We jointly model
those observed labels as well as unsupervised topic
modelling. In our experiments, we have shown that
the resulting model jointly predicts the region and
the time of a given court document. Across vocab-
ulary sizes and number of topics, we have achieved
better system accuracy than state-of-the-art genera-
tive and discriminative models of text. Our quantita-
tive analysis shows that early US state supreme court
opinions are predictable, and contains distinct views
towards slave-related topics, and the shifts among
opinions depending on different periods of time. In
addition, our model has been shown to be effective
for qualitative analysis of historical data, revealing
patterns that are consistent with the history of the
period.
This approach to modelling text is not limited
to the legal domain. A key aspect of future work
will be to extend the Sparse Mixed-Effects paradigm
to other problems within the social sciences where
metadata is available but qualitative analysis at a
large scale is difficult or impossible. In addition
to historical documents, this can include humani-
ties texts, which are often sorely lacking in empir-
ical justifications, and analysis of online communi-
ties, which are often rife with available metadata but
produce content far faster than it can be analyzed by
experts.

This work extends prior work in topic modelling by incorporating metadata, and the interactions between the components in metadata, in a general way. To test this, we collect a corpus of slavery-related United States property law judgements sampled from the years 1730 to 1866. We study the language use in these legal cases, with a special focus on shifts in opinions on controversial topics across different regions. Because this is a longitudinal data set, we are also interested in understanding how these opinions change over the course of decades. We show that the joint learning scheme of our sparse mixed-effects model improves on other state-of-the-art generative and discriminative models on the region and time period identification tasks.

In contrast, the primary methods for historical research still rely on individual judgement and reading primary and secondary sources, which are time consuming and expensive. Furthermore, traditional human-based methods might have good precision when searching for relevant information, but suffer from low recall. Even when language technologies have been applied to historical problems, their focus has often been on information retrieval (Gotscharek et al., 2009), to improve accessibility of texts. Empirical methods for analysis and interpretation of these texts is therefore a burgeoning new </context>

Since there exists many thousands of early court opinions, however, it is difficult for legal historians to manually analyze the documents case by case. Instead, historians often restrict themselves to discussing a relatively small subset of legal opinions that are considered decisive. While this approach has merit, new technologies should allow extraction of patterns from large samples of opinions. Latent variable models, such as latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003) and probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA) (Hofmann, 1999), have been used in the past to facilitate social science research. However, they have numerous drawbacks, as many topics are uninterpretable, overwhelmed by uninformative words, or represent background language use that is unrelated to the dimensions of analysis that qualitative researchers are interested in. SAGE (Eisenstein et al., 2011a), a recently proposed sparse additive generative model of language, addresses many of the drawbacks of LDA.

Experiments show that our sparse mixed-effects model is more accurate quantitatively and qualitatively interesting, and that these improvements are robust across different parameter settings. 1 Introduction Many scientific subjects, such as psychology, learning sciences, and biology, have adopted computational approaches to discover latent patterns in large scale datasets (Chen and Lombardi, 2010; Baker and Yacef, 2009). In contrast, the primary methods for historical research still rely on individual judgement and reading primary and secondary sources, which are time consuming and expensive. Furthermore, traditional human-based methods might have good precision when searching for relevant information, but suffer from low recall. Even when language technologies have been applied to historical problems, their focus has often been on information retrieval (Gotscharek et al., 2009), to improve accessibility of texts.

While this approach has merit, new technologies should allow extraction of patterns from large samples of opinions. Latent variable models, such as latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003) and probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA) (Hofmann, 1999), have been used in the past to facilitate social science research. However, they have numerous drawbacks, as many topics are uninterpretable, overwhelmed by uninformative words, or represent background language use that is unrelated to the dimensions of analysis that qualitative researchers are interested in. SAGE (Eisenstein et al., 2011a), a recently proposed sparse additive generative model of language, addresses many of the drawbacks of LDA. SAGE assumes a background distribution of language use, and enforces sparsity in individual topics. Another advantage, from a social science perspective, is that SAGE can be derived from a standard logit randomutility model of judicial opinion writing, in contrast to LDA. In this work we extend SAGE to the supervised case of joint region and time period prediction.

Such topic models are often dominated by function words and do not always effectively separate topics. Recent work have shown significant gains in both predictiveness and interpretatibility by enforcing sparsity, such as in the task of discovering sociolinguistic patterns of language use (Eisenstein et al., 2011b). Our proposed sparse mixed-effects model balances the pros and cons the above methods, aiming at higher classification accuracies using the SME model for joint geographic and temporal aspects prediction, as well as richer interaction of components from metadata to enhance historical analysis in legal opinions.

To compare the two models in different settings, we first empirically set the number of topics K in our SME model to be 25, as this setting was shown to yield a promising result in a previous study (Eisenstein et al., 2011a) on sparse topic models. In terms of the size of vocabulary W for both the SME and SVM learner, we select three values to represent dense, medium or sparse feature spaces: W1 = 29, W2 = 212, and the full vocabulary size of W3 = 213.8. Table 1 shows the accuracy of both models, as well as the relative improvement (gain) of SME over SVM. When looking at the experiment results under different settings, we see that the SME model always outperforms the SVM learner.

The performance of SVM in the binary region classification is stronger than in the previous task, but SME is able to outperform SVM in all three settings, with tightened advantages (p &lt; 0.05 in W2 and p &lt; 0.001 in W3). We hypothesize that it might because that SVM, as a strong large margin learner, is a more natural approach in a binary classification setting, but might not be the best choice in a fourway or multiclass classification task. 5.1.2 Comparing SME to SAGE In this experiment, we compare SME with a stateof-the-art sparse generative model: SAGE (Eisenstein et al., 2011a). Most studies on topic modelling have not been able to report results when using different sizes of vocabulary for training. Because of the importance of interpretability for social science research, the choice of vocabulary size is critical to ensure understandable topics. Thus we report our results at various vocabulary sizes W on SME and SAGE. To better validate the performance of SME, we also include the performance of SVM in this experiment, and fix the number of topics K = 10 for the SME and SAGE models, which is a different value for the number of topics K than the empirical K we use</context>

Topic 4 concerns indentures and apprentices. Interestingly, the terms indentures and apprenticeships are more prominent in the non-slave states, reflecting the fact that apprenticeships and indentures were used in many border states as a substitute for slavery, and these were often governed by continued usage of Master and Servant law (Orren, 1992). Topic 5 shows the constitutional crisis in the states. In particular, the anti-slavery state courts are prone to use the term “unconstitutional” much more often than the slave states.

Furthermore, traditional human-based methods might have good precision when searching for relevant information, but suffer from low recall. Even when language technologies have been applied to historical problems, their focus has often been on information retrieval (Gotscharek et al., 2009), to improve accessibility of texts. Empirical methods for analysis and interpretation of these texts is therefore a burgeoning new field. Court opinions form one of the most important parts of the legal domain, and can serve as an excellent resource to understand both legal and political history (Popkin, 2007). Historians often use court opinions as a primary source for constructing interpretations of the past. They not only report the proceedings of a court, but also express a judges’ views toward the issues at hand in a case, and reflect the legal and political environment of the region and period. Since there exists many thousands of early court opinions, however, it is difficult for legal historians to manually analyze the documents case by case. Instead, historians often restrict themselves to discussing a relatively small subset of legal opinions that are considered decisive. While this appro</context>

Temporally, topic models have been used to show the shift in language use over time in online communities (Nguyen and Ros´e, 2011) and the evolution of topics over time (Shubhankar et al., 2011). When evaluating understandability, however, dense word distributions are a serious issue in many topic models as well as other predictive tasks. Such topic models are often dominated by function words and do not always effectively separate topics. Recent work have shown significant gains in both predictiveness and interpretatibility by enforcing sparsity, such as in the task of discovering sociolinguistic patterns of language use (Eisenstein et al., 2011b).

Under this condition, the sparse topic advantage of SME might be less salient. Secondly, in the two tasks, it is observed that the accuracy of the binary region classification task is much higher than the four-way task, thus while the latter benefits significantly from this joint learning scheme of the SME model, but the former might not have the equivalent gain5. 5We hypothesize that this problem might be eliminated if Figure 5: Accuracy on predicting the region varying the number of topics K, while W is fixed to 29. Unlike hierarchical Dirichlet processes (Teh et al., 2006), in parametric Bayesian generative models, the number of topics K is often set manually, and can influence the model’s accuracy significantly. In this experiment, we fix the input vocabulary W to 29, and compare the mixed-effect model with SAGE in both region and time identification tasks. Figure 4 shows how the variations of K can influence the system performance in the time quartile prediction task. We can see that the sparse mixedeffects model (SME) reaches its best performance when the K is 40.

The word “man-trap”, a term used to refer to states where free blacks could be kidnapped purpose of enslaving them. The fugitive slave conflicts of the mid-19th century that led to the civil war were precisely about this aversion of the northern states to having to return runaway slaves to the Southern states. Besides these subjective observations about the historical significance of the SME topics, we also conduct a more formal analysis comparing the SME classification to that conducted by a legal historian. Wahl (2002) analyses and classifies by hand 10989 slave cases in the US South into 6 categories: “Hires”, “Sales”, “Transfers”, “Common Carrier”, “Black Rights” and “Other”. An example of “Hires” is Topic 4. Topics 1, 2, and 3 concern “Transfers” of slave property between inheritors, descendants and heirs-at-law. Topic 5 would be classified as “Other”. We take each of our 25 modelled topics and classify them along Wahl’s categories, using “Other” when a classification could not be obtained. The classifications are quite transparent in virtually all cases, as certain words (such as “employer” or “bequest”</context>

We plan to conduct more vertical and temporal analyses using SME in the future. 6 Conclusion and Future Work In this work, we propose a sparse mixed-effects model for historical analysis of text.

In our experiments, we have shown that the resulting model jointly predicts the region and the time of a given court document. Across vocabulary sizes and number of topics, we have achieved better system accuracy than state-of-the-art generative and discriminative models of text.

The effectiveness of SME could depend not just on its predictive power, but also in its ability to generate topics that will be useful to historians of the period. Supreme court opinions on slavery are of significant interest for American political history. The conflict over slave property rights was at the heart of the “cold war” (Wright, 2006) between North and South leading up to the U.S. Civil War. The historical importance of this conflict between Northern and Southern legal institutions is one of the motivations for choosing our data domain.
