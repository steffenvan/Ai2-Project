The 19th Annual Meeting of the Association for
Computational Linguistics will be held at Stanford
University, Stanford, California, from Monday, June
29, through Wednesday, July 1, 1981. Papers are
being solicited on linguistically and computationally
significant topics, including the following:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.985190714285714">
. syntax, parsing, and sentence generation,
. computational semantics (including reference,
anaphora, metaphor),
• discourse analysis and speech acts,
• representation of knowledge, deduction, planning,
and plan recognition, as they relate to language
understanding,
• speech analysis and synthesis,
• machine translation and machine-aided transla-
tion,
• mathematical foundations of computational lin-
guistics, and
• linguistic theories and their computational appli-
cations.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9671945">
Authors wishing to present a paper should submit
six copies of a 5 to 8 page summary, double-spaced,
by February 2, 1981 to: C. Raymond Perrault, Bolt
Beranek and Newman, 50 Moulton Street, Cambridge,
Mass. 02138 [phone: (617) 491-1850; ARPAnet:
RPerrault@bbna].
All submissions will be read by the program com-
mittee, which is chaired by C. Raymond Perrault, Uni-
versity of Toronto (on leave at SRI International and
BBN), and consists of Bertram Bruce, Bolt Beranek
and Newman, Jaime Carbonnell, Carnegie-Mellon Uni-
versity, Mitchell Marcus, Bell Labs, Ellen Prince, Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania, and Ralph Weischedel, Univer-
sity of Delaware.
It is important that the summary convey the new
ideas and contain sufficient information to allow the
program committee to determine the scope of the
work, including references to the relevant literature.
Summaries exceeding 8 double-spaced pages in length
may not receive the attention they deserve.
Authors will be notified of the acceptance of their
papers by March 16, 1981. Full-length versions of
accepted papers submitted by April 27, 1981 to the
program committee chairman will be included in the
