Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.9998947">
Space characters can have an important role
in disambiguating text. However, few, if
any, Chinese information extraction systems
make full use of space characters. However,
it seems that treatment of space characters
is necessary, especially in cases of extract-
ing information from semi-structured docu-
ments. This investigation aims to address
the importance of space characters in Chi-
nese information extraction by parsing some
semi-structured documents with two simi-
lar grammars - one with treatment for space
characters, the other ignoring it. This paper
also introduces two post processing filters
to further improve treatment of space char-
acters. Results show that the grammar that
takes account of spaces clearly out-performs
the one that ignores them, and so concludes
that space characters can play a useful role in
information extraction.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999987772727273">
It is well known that a snippet of text in Chi-
nese (or some other oriental languages) consists of
a span of continuous characters without delimiting
white spaces to identify words. Therefore, most pars-
ing systems do not make full use of space charac-
ters when parsing. Furthermore, even though Latin-
based languages such as English have delimiting
white spaces between words, most systems treat them
as no more than delimiting characters. Therefore,
space characters are usually stripped out of the text
before processing.
However, this is intuitively wrong. (Rus and
Summers, 1994) stated that “the non-textual con-
tent of documents complement the textual content and
should play an equal role”. This paper shows that
space character plays an equal role as the textual con-
tent, where it can be used not only to construct a cer-
tain layout, but also to signal a certain syntactic struc-
ture. Some researchers have been seen to make use of
space characters, but they mainly use spaces to cre-
ate or recognise certain special layouts. For example,
(Rus and Summers, 1994) used white spaces to refor-
mat documents into somewhat structured styles; (Ng
et al., 1999) and (Hurst and Nasukawa, 2000) used
spaces to recognise tables in free text. Wrapper gen-
eration is more related to our research since it uses
layout to extract structured content from documents
(Irmak and Suel, 2006; Chen et al., 2003). How-
ever, wrapper generation is too high level, this paper
is aimed at exploring the effects of space characters
at a lower level.
In this paper, we focus on semi-structured doc-
uments (in our case, real-world Chinese Curricula
Vitae), since these types of documents tend to con-
tain more space layout information. This paper is
intended to address the importance of space charac-
ters not only in layout extraction, but also in infor-
mation extraction. To do so, Daxtra Technologies’
grammar formalism and their additional elements for
basic space character treatment is introduced 1. Then
an improved treatment plan is given for further dis-
ambiguation. Finally, we perform evaluation of the
tools on a set of real-world CVs and give proposals
for future work.

2 Space Characters
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999527967741936">
A space character, when considered as punctu-
ation, is a blank area devoid of content, serving to
separate words, letters, numbers and other punctu-
ation. (Jones, 1994) found broadly three types of
punctuation marks: delimiting, separating and dis-
ambiguating. Similarly, space characters have three
different functionalities: delimiting, structuring and
disambiguating.
Space characters are natural delimiters in some
languages. In English and many other Latin-based
languages for example, spaces are used for separat-
ing words and certain punctuation marks (e.g. period
and colon). However, in formal Chinese typesetting,
spaces are not used to delimit words or characters.
Hence the need for automatic word segmentation sys-
tems (Zhang et al., 2003). The current segmenta-
tion systems mainly focus on resolving ambiguities
and detecting new words in segmenting text with no
spaces (Gao et al., 2005). However, ambiguities can
be caused not only by characters themselves, but also
the spaces and layout around them. The paper will
later demonstrate this in terms of recognising entities,
but the same should apply to segmentation.
Therefore, Chinese documents can have white
spaces, it is up to the author of the document to de-
cide when to use spaces, which makes dealing with
people’s spacing habits one of the reasons to include
treatment of space characters in linguistic systems.
Structuring refers to space characters being used
for layout purposes. For example, spaces and tabs
can be used to create tables, putting spaces in front

of a piece of text means to start a new paragraph
etc. In some cases, such structuring space characters
represent a relation between the elements that the
spaces are delimiting. For the following example,
each line contains a label and a value separated using
spaces to create a table.

Disambiguating spaces occur where an unintentional
ambiguity could result if the spaces were not there.
Two types of ambiguities are usually caused by ig-
noring the effect of white space:
Overlapping Ambiguity, where a set of tokens can
either be appended to the previous set of tokens
to form an entity, or precede the next set of to-
kens to form a different entity. For example, in a
Chinese CV’s job history section, the following
two situations could occur:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.903776333333333">

pany
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999873076923077">
In the above example, two spans of text use ex-
actly the same set of characters, but since the
space is not in the same place, they have differ-
ent meanings. Thus ignoring white space in this
case could result in an overlapping ambiguity.
Combinatorial Ambiguity, where two sets of to-
kens can either be joined to form a single entity,
or be separated to form two different entities.
For example, “4W 助W” could mean Man-
ager Assistant when joined together, or since
there are spaces in between the two words “4
W” and “助W”, they could also mean Manager
and Assistant.

Daxtra Technologies’ parsing system is a gram-
mar formalism used to develop grammatical rules for
recognising Named Entities and Relations. The sys-
tem is based on context free grammar, but includes
additional elements for integrating linguistic infor-
mation (e.g. grammar and lexicon) and layout infor-
mation (e.g. space characters) to parse structured and
unstructured text. Along with parsing the text, the
parser also labels the matched text with XML tags.
A typical Daxtra grammar rule looks like the
following:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.674929">
: person =
person-firstname
+ person-lastname !ATTACHED_L
: person =
person-firstname
+ person-midname !ATTACHED_L
+ person-lastname !ATTACHED_L
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.980882244444445">
As the above example illustrates, a rule begins
with a colon and the rule’s name. For example, con-
sider the following two person names:
Rongzhou Shen
Andrew Peter Baker
assuming that “Rongzhou Shen” matches the first
rule and “Andrew Peter Baker” matches the second
rule, then both will be surrouned by &lt;person&gt;
XML tags.
Contents following the equal sign are a combi-
nation of other defined grammar rule names or lex-
icon names to build up the body of the person
rules. Thus, for the first person rule to match a
piece of text, the sub contents of the text must match
person-firstname and person-lastname
in the order given. Any other contents between a right
hand side rule name and its XML tag replacement
(i.e. the square bracketed contents) are attributes at-
tached to the rule. These attributes include layout in-
formation.
For describing layout information, the Dax-
tra grammar formalism offers three types of
space grammar rule: ATTACHED (ATTACHED L,
ATTACHED R), TABULATION (TABULATION L,
TABULATION M, TABULATION R) and
LINEBREAK (LINEBREAK L, LINEBREAK M,
LINEBREAK R).
ATTACHED This attribute checks the matching con-
tents of the attached rule for surrounding
spaces. Accordingly, ATTACHED L detects
spaces on the left of the matching contents, and
ATTACHED R detects spaces on the right of the
matching contents.
TABULATION Similar to ATTACHED, this checks
for tabulation characters in the matching con-
tents. TABULATION L, TABULATION M and
TABULATION R checks for tabulations before,
inside or after the matching text respectively. A
tabulation is either a tab character or a span of
more than three continuous white spaces.
LINEBREAK As the name suggests, this at-
tribute checks for line breaks in the match-
ing text. LINEBREAK L, LINEBREAK M and
LINEBREAK R checks for line breaks before,
inside or after the matching text respectively.

Although the Daxtra grammar formalism offers
a full range of space layout descriptors, questions still
arise. Consider the job history examples in Table 1.
The first one would parse correctly with some sim-
ple grammar such as the following (assuming that we
have all the needed lexicons):
: history = date-range !ATTACHED_R
+ company !ATTACHED_R
+ occupation !ATTACHED_R
+ occupation
However, the same rule would become ambigu-
ous for the second example, where there is a space

Table 1: An example job history section in a CV file
between “经理” (Manager) and “助理” (Assistant).
In such a case, two matches are found, as shown in
Table 2.
</tableCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.98336825">
We may notice that the word “助理” (Assistant)
is closer to the word “经理” (Manager) than the word
“会计” (Accountant), hence the correct entities be-
ing “经 理 助 理” (Manager Assistant) and “会 计”
(Accountant). If on the other hand, there were more
spaces between “经理” (Manager) and “助理” (As-
sistant) than “助理” (Assistant) and “会计” (Accoun-
tant), we may infer that the entities would be “经理”
(Manager) and “助理会计” (Assistant Accountant).
Therefore, more control is needed for incorpo-
rating space layout information. For example, the
problem in Table 2 can be resolved by comparing
the number of spaces between the words. To do so,
we replaced the spaces with XML tags with an at-
tribute indicating the number of spaces replaced. For
example, a span of four spaces will become: &lt;w
spaces=’4’ /&gt;. Based on such a transformation,
we came up with the following post-processing filters
for resolving ambiguities and other errors caused by
space characters:
Filter least-space For different matches of the same
rule, always choose the match that has the least
number of spaces inside the entities.
For example, consider the two cases in Table 3.
They both have exactly the same set of charac-
ters, but are in fact two different combinations,
as indicated by the translations in the table.
Assuming that a simple rule like the following is
used to match both the job histories:
: history = date !ATTACHED_R
+ company
+ occupation
Then for (1) in Table 3, the two possible matches
are shown in Table 4.
Therefore, the first match yields a total of one
space inside the entities (between “年” and
“冬”), while the second match yields three
spaces (between “冬” and “宝洁公司”). Thus
the first match is chosen.
Similarly for (2) in Table 3, there are two pos-
sible matches (see Table 5), in which the first
has four spaces inside the entities and the sec-
ond has two spaces, so the system chooses the
second match.
Filter equal-space For a parsing with only one pos-
sible match, check whether the entity contains
an unequal number of spaces between charac-
ters.
For example, “中 国 会 计 M 则 上 市 公 司”
(Chinese Accountant Regulations Listed Com-
pany) can be recognised by the system as a
company entity, but it is in fact not. Thus in
this case, the filter equal-space will reject it -
there are no spaces between the first six charac-
ters, but two spaces appear after them, so the two
spaces are not considered as part of an entity.

neglected in named entity recognition tasks. A much
lower number of system annotated characters for Ver-
sion 1 shows that the layout information is disam-
biguating multiple matches, thus rejecting many pre-
dictions.
Although not as significant, Version 2 has still
gained an improvement on performance over Version
1 by 0.75% in F1 score. A lower number of pre-
dicted annotations and a higher number of correctly
predicted annotations both indicate more ambiguities
have been resolved as a result.
Further investigations into the errors made by
the Baseline showed that most ambiguities were over-
lapping ambiguities (over 90%). A possible reason
for the smaller number of combinatorial ambiguities
could be that people tend to be careful in writing
their CVs, and tend to disambiguate entities by them-
selves. For example, instead of writing “经理
理”, separating the two words using a space, people
will use punctuation marks to divide them. Further-
more, the case where people put spaces between each
character wasn’t so often seen: there were 16 CVs in
total where such a case was found. Thus filter equal-
space did not disambiguate many.
Further dividing the results down into smaller
parts, we found that most of the ambiguities in the
Baseline came from company, educational, occupa-
tion and subject names. This has two main causes:
(1) These entities’ grammar contain many generative
rules, so ambiguities can not be avoided; (2) The con-
text around these entities contain the most layout in-
formation (e.g. job history, educational history). Date
and date-range entities were not affected so much by
the layout information since they are straightforward
to recognise. However, there was one case where the
Baseline predicted a date wrongly:

<bodyText confidence="0.999898076923077">
The Baseline version predicted “1997年1月1
Q” as a single entity of type date. This is obviously
a human typing error, where the author missed out
“Q” on the end of the date. This error was later fixed
by Version 1.
From to the above discussion, we may know that
least-space is mainly targeted at resolving overlap-
ping ambiguities (which account for more than 90%
of the ambiguities found), thus making it the more
significant filter of the two.
Although Version 1 and Version 2 both had im-
provements over the Baseline, many errors still occur
and they are categorized as follows:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.991312636363636">
• Rejections caused by filter equal-space were in
fact real entities, uneven spaces in the entities
were mostly human typing error;
• Choices made by filter least-space were occa-
sionally wrong. This happens most often when
two matches have a very small difference in the
number of spaces inside entities;
• Grammars either overgenerate (cause plain to-
kens to be predicted as entities) or undergenerate
(cause entities to be not detected);
• Lack of lexicon.

6 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999934842105263">
This paper has attempted to address the impor-
tance of space characters in Chinese linguistic pars-
ing or information extraction in semi-structured doc-
uments. Essentially, space characters can contribute
to the syntactic structure of texts and should not be
only treated as delimiters or be stripped out of the
document. This is especially true for semi-structured
documents such as CVs.
As our results indicate, integrating simple layout
information with linguistic grammars can greatly im-
prove the performance of information extraction. A
further improvement can be achieved using the two
filters introduced in the fourth section.
Although Daxtra’s grammar formalism is cho-
sen as the tool for information extraction, since it al-
ready includes treatment of space characters, other
tools are also available to carry out the same job.
For example, Edinburgh University Language Tech-
nology Group’s LT-TTT2 (Grover and Tobin, 2006)

Our paper focuses mainly on Chinese CVs, but
space layout information can be used widely in other
languages and documents. In English for exam-
ple, although words are separated by a single space,
spaces are not always used as delimiters (e.g. con-
structing tables, columns), thus providing the need
for integrating space layout. In terms of document
types, plain paragraph based text (e.g. articles, blogs
etc.) may not be affected too much by space char-
acters, but integrating space layout information in
parsing these documents should not decrease perfor-
mance either. Furthermore, semi-structured docu-
ments may not be just limited to CVs: people’s online
portfolios, advertisements etc. all have space layout
information attached. Therefore, much investigation
still needs to be done on the effect of space characters
in different types of documents.

<abstract confidence="0.998706476190476">Space characters can have an important role in disambiguating text. However, few, if any, Chinese information extraction systems make full use of space characters. However, it seems that treatment of space characters is necessary, especially in cases of extracting information from semi-structured documents. This investigation aims to address the importance of space characters in Chinese information extraction by parsing some semi-structured documents with two similar grammars one with treatment for space characters, the other ignoring it. This paper also introduces two post processing filters to further improve treatment of space characters. Results show that the grammar that takes account of spaces clearly out-performs the one that ignores them, and so concludes that space characters can play a useful role in information extraction.</abstract>

Some researchers have been seen to make use of space characters, but they mainly use spaces to create or recognise certain special layouts. For example, (Rus and Summers, 1994) used white spaces to reformat documents into somewhat structured styles; (Ng et al., 1999) and (Hurst and Nasukawa, 2000) used spaces to recognise tables in free text.

Space characters are natural delimiters in some languages. In English and many other Latin-based languages for example, spaces are used for separating words and certain punctuation marks (e.g. period and colon). However, in formal Chinese typesetting, spaces are not used to delimit words or characters. Hence the need for automatic word segmentation systems (Zhang et al., 2003). The current segmentation systems mainly focus on resolving ambiguities and detecting new words in segmenting text with no spaces (Gao et al., 2005). However, ambiguities can be caused not only by characters themselves, but also the spaces and layout around them. The paper will later demonstrate this in terms of recognising entities, but the same should apply to segmentation. Therefore, Chinese documents can have white spaces, it is up to the author of the document to decide when to use spaces, which makes dealing with people’s spacing habits one of the reasons to include treatment of space characters in linguistic systems. Structuring refers to space characters being used for layout purposes. For example, spaces and tabs can be used to c</context>

As our results indicate, integrating simple layout information with linguistic grammars can greatly improve the performance of information extraction. A further improvement can be achieved using the two filters introduced in the fourth section. Although Daxtra’s grammar formalism is chosen as the tool for information extraction, since it already includes treatment of space characters, other tools are also available to carry out the same job. For example, Edinburgh University Language Technology Group’s LT-TTT2 (Grover and Tobin, 2006) 3. Our paper focuses mainly on Chinese CVs, but space layout information can be used widely in other languages and documents. In English for example, although words are separated by a single space, spaces are not always used as delimiters (e.g. constructing tables, columns), thus providing the need for integrating space layout. In terms of document types, plain paragraph based text (e.g. articles, blogs etc.) may not be affected too much by space characters, but integrating space layout information in parsing these documents should not decrease performance either.

Therefore, most parsing systems do not make full use of space characters when parsing. Furthermore, even though Latinbased languages such as English have delimiting white spaces between words, most systems treat them as no more than delimiting characters. Therefore, space characters are usually stripped out of the text before processing. However, this is intuitively wrong. (Rus and Summers, 1994) stated that “the non-textual content of documents complement the textual content and should play an equal role”. This paper shows that space character plays an equal role as the textual content, where it can be used not only to construct a certain layout, but also to signal a certain syntactic structure.
