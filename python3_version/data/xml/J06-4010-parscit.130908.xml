This book is an extended description of a
knowledge representation formalism, mul-
tilayered extended semantic networks (or
MultiNets), used by the author and his col-
leagues for the semantic representation of
natural language. The level of detail means
that this is not an easy or introductory read;
the book will be most useful for other re-
searchers engaged in reconciling knowledge
representation and natural language, espe-
cially those looking to compare representa-
tional devices for dealing with a range of
semantic phenomena.
Since the book principally sets out to
document what MultiNets are, a brief de-
scription is in order. An ordinary semantic
network consists of a set of concepts and
a set of binary relations between concepts
(e.g., kind of, part of), often represented as a
directed graph. MultiNets build on ordinary
semantic networks via extension, layering,
and encapsulation.

<listItem confidence="0.978907516129032">
• Extension: MultiNets allow n-ary
relations and functions, as well
as parameterized entities for
representing dependencies between
conceptual items. A predefined,
and well-documented, vocabulary
of around 100 relations and 20
functions (e.g., agent, cause) is
assumed.
• Layering: MultiNets embed
conceptual items into a
multidimensional space. One of
the more significant dimensions
is the intensional/(pre-)extensional
one. The intensional dimension
represents relations between
kinds of objects (either specific
sub-kinds or generic), whereas the
pre-extensional dimension covers
such things as the cardinalities of
extensions of concepts.
• Encapsulation: Relations that
are definitional of a particular
conceptual node are encapsulated
and thus distinguished from those
that are just accidentally or
situationally true of the node.
Encapsulation provides a way
of distinguishing between
different forms of restrictive and
non-restrictive modification.

Using the machinery of MultiNets, the author
illustrates a variety of semantic phenomena,
including comparative constructions, spatial
and temporal relations, intensional and ex-
tensional forms of negation, modalities, car-
dinality and plurality, and relations between
situations.
Philosophically, the book espouses a
“meaning as use” approach to the semantics
of MultiNets, rather than a model-theoretic
one. While this is an attractive position, the
chapter on question answering and inference
is too brief to provide much insight about the
intended use of MultiNets. This sometimes
makes it hard to determine what particular
MultiNets are supposed to mean, or how the
meaning of one relates to and differs from
that of another. The discussion of intensional
and extensional negation is a case in point,
where pairings of different German sentences
(with English translations) and MultiNet
diagrams do not always elucidate the dis-
tinctions being drawn. The presentation
would have benefited from explanation of
how different parts of the representations
target different aspects of the situation being
described.
The technical core of the book is an ad-
mirably comprehensive description of each
of the 120 or so relations and functions used
by MultiNets, drawn from what is clearly
very detailed system documentation. But
much of the text surrounding this core also
reads like hyperlinked system documenta-
tion, with a welter of forward and backward
references to other sections throughout. This
makes it hard for the uninitiated to work
their way into understanding what Multi-
Nets are about, and stronger editorial direc-
tion in the first part of the book could have
made it shorter, more self-contained, and
easier to follow.—Dick Crouch, Palo Alto Re-
search Center

“Evaluating ideas:... Studies reveal that the
prestige of the author or coauthors is the first
measure of the value of a [scholarly] publi-
cation, quite independent of any new ideas
the publication may contain. After writing a
paper, it is worthwhile to find a prestigious
person who is willing to become a coauthor.
... In addition, ... there is yet another way
to measure a paper’s value without trying
to read and understand it. That method is to
see how many subsequent papers refer back
to it.... The use of these evaluation methods
has led to the Law Governing the Value of
Technical Publications: The value of a technical
article, when first published, is proportional to the
sum of the prestige of its authors, but its ultimate
value is proportional to the number of references
to it. It should be noted that this law refers to
the value of a paper to its authors, as opposed
to any value it may also have to the technical
community.”—pp. 141–142.
