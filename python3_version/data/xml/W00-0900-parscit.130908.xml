Anyone who has worked with corpora will be all too aware of differences between them. De-
pending on the differences, it may, or may not, be reasonable to expect results based on one corpus
to also be valid for another. It may, or may not, be appropriate for a grammar, or parser, based on
one to perform well on another. It may, or may not, be straightforward to port an application from
a domain of the first text type to a domain of the second. Currently, characterisations of corpora are
mostly textual and informal. A corpus is described as &amp;quot;Wall Street Journal&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;transcripts of business
meetings&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;foreign learners&apos; essays (intermediate grade)&amp;quot;. It would be desirable to be able to place
a new corpus in relation to existing ones, and to be able to quantify similarities and differences.
Allied to corpus-similarity is corpus-homogeneity. An understanding of homogeneity is a pre-
requisite to a measure of similarity — it makes little sense to compare a corpus sampled across many
genres, like the Brown, with a corpus of weather forecasts, without first accounting for the one being
broad, the other narrow.
Given the centrality of corpora to contemporary language engineering, it is remarkable how little
research there has been on corpus similarity. The only well-understood measure is cross-entropy, from
Information Theory, which is widely used in language modelling, particularly for speech recognition
(see, eg, Roukos 1996). However it is not clear whether, or where, it is a good measure, and there is
some evidence that it does not match our intuitions (Kilgarriff and Rose 1998, Kilgarriff in press).
Biber&apos;s work (1989, 1995) on corpus characterisation, coming from sociolinguistics, has made a
considerable impact, with various researchers applying the model in language engineering (eg Folch
et at 2000) or subjecting it to critical scrutiny (Lee 2000). Studies in text classification, genre and
sublanguage are also salient, but it is rarely evident how well the technologies developed in these
fields are suited to measuring corpus similarity or homogeneity.
There are of course many ways in which two corpora will differ, and different kinds of difference
will be relevant for different kinds of purposes. Thus, similarity such that a part-of-speech tagger
developed for one corpus works well in the other, may differ from similarity for Machine Translation.
We currently lack a sophisticated vocabulary for talking about the various ways in which corpora
differ, and hope that the workshop will contribute to the development of one.
We welcomed contributions concerned with measuring and comparing corpora from any field.
