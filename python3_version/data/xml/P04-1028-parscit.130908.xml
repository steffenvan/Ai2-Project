This paper describes and evaluates MOP, an
IE system for automatic extraction of
metalinguistic information from technical and
scientific documents. We claim that such a
system can create special databases to boot-
strap compilation and facilitate update of the
huge and dynamically changing glossaries,
knowledge bases and ontologies that are vital
to modern-day research.

<bodyText confidence="0.979469126984128">
Availability of large-scale corpora has made it
possible to mine specific knowledge from free or
semi-structured text, resulting in what many con-
sider by now a reasonably mature NLP technolo-
gy. Extensive research in Information Extraction
(IE) techniques, especially with the series of Mes-
sage Understanding Conferences of the nineties,
has focused on tasks such as creating and updating
databases of corporate join ventures or terrorist
and guerrilla attacks, while the ACQUILEX pro-
ject used similar methods for creating lexical da-
tabases using the highly structured environment of
machine-readable dictionary entries and other re-
sources. Gathering knowledge from unstructured
text often requires manually crafting knowledge-
engineering rules both complex and deeply de-
pendent of the domain at hand, although some
successful experiences using learning algorithms
have been reported (Fisher et al., 1995; Chieu et
al., 2003).
Although mining specific semantic relations
and subcategorization information from free-text
has been successfully carried out in the past
(Hearst, 1999; Manning, 1993), automatically ex-
tracting lexical resources (including terminologi-
cal definitions) from text in special domains has
been a field less explored, but recent experiences
(Klavans et al., 2001; Rodríguez, 2001; Cartier,
1998) show that compiling the extensive resources
that modern scientific and technical disciplines
need in order to manage the explosive growth of
their knowledge, is both feasible and practical. A
good example of this NLP-based processing need
is the MedLine abstract database maintained by
the National Library of Medicine1 (NLM), which
incorporates around 40,000 Health Sciences pa-
pers each month. Researchers depend on these
electronic resources to keep abreast of their rapid-
ly changing field. In order to maintain and update
vital indexing references such as the Unified Me-
dical Language System (UMLS) resources, the
MeSH and SPECIALIST vocabularies, the NLM
staff needs to review 400,000 highly-technical
papers each year. Clearly, neology detection, ter-
minological information update and other tasks
can benefit from applications that automatically
search text for information, e.g., when a new term
is introduced or an existing one is modified due to
data or theory-driven concerns, or, in general,
when new information about sublanguage usage is
being put forward. But the usefulness of robust
NLP applications for special-domain text goes
beyond glossary updates. The kind of categoriza-
tion information implicit in many definitions can
help improve anaphora resolution, semantic ty-
ping or acronym identification in these corpora, as
well as enhance “semantic rerendering” of spe-
cial-domain ontologies and thesaurii (Pustejovsky
et al., 2002).
In this paper we describe and evaluate the
MOP2 IE system, implemented to automatically
create Metalinguistic Information Databases
(MIDs) from large collections of special-domain

the first phase of the MOP tasks: accurate location
of good candidate metalinguistic sentences for

manually coded rules and with learning algo-
rithms for this task. Section 4 focuses on the pro-
blem of identifying and organizing into a useful
database structure the different linguistic consti-

2.1 Explicit Metalinguistic Operations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.974164341772152">
Preliminary empirical work to explore how re-
searchers modify the terminological framework of
their highly complex conceptual systems, included
manual review of a corpus of 19 sociology articles
(138,183 words) published in various British,
American and Canadian academic journals with
strict peer-review policies. We look at how term
manipulation was done as well as how metalin-
guistic activity was signaled in text, both by lexi-
cal and paralinguistic means. Some of the
indicators found included verbs and verbal phra-
ses like called, known as, defined as, termed, co-
ined, dubbed, and descriptors such as term and
word. Other non-lexical markers included quota-
tion marks, apposition and text formatting.
A collection of potential metalinguistic patterns
identified in the exploratory Sociology corpus was
expanded (using other verbal tenses and forms) to
116 queries sent to the scientific and learned do-
mains of the British National Corpus. The resul-
ting 10,937 sentences were manually classified as
metalinguistic or otherwise, with 5,407 (49.6% of
total) found to be truly metalinguistic sentences.
The presence of three components described be-
low (autonym, informative segment and mar-
kers/operators) was the criteria for classification.
Reliability of human subjects for this task has not
been reported in the literature, and was not eva-
luated in our experiments.
Careful analysis of this extensive corpus presen-
ted some interesting facts about what we have
termed “Explicit Metalinguistic Operations” (or
EMOs) in specialized discourse:
A) EMOs usually do not follow the genus-
differentia scheme of aristotelian definitions, nor
conform to the rigid and artificial structure of dic-
tionary entries. More often than not, specific in-
formation about language use and term definition
is provided by sentences such as: (1) This means
that they ingest oxygen from the air via fine
hollow tubes, known as tracheae, in which the
term trachea is linked to the description fine
hollow tubes in the context of a globally non-
metalinguistic sentence. Partial and heterogeneous
information, rather that a complete definition, are
much more common.
B) Introduction of metalinguistic information in
discourse is highly regular, regardless of the spe-
cific domain. This can be credited to the fact that
the writer needs to mark these sentences for spe-
cial processing by the reader, as they dissect
across two different semiotic levels: a metalan-
guage and its object language, to use the termino-
logy of logic where these concepts originate.3 Its
constitutive markedness means that most of the
times these sentences will have at least two indi-
cators present, for example a verb and a descrip-
tor, or quotation marks, or even have preceding
sentences that announce them in some way. These
formal and cognitive properties of EMOs facilitate
the task of locating them accurately in text.
C) EMOs can be further analyzed into 3 distinct
components, each with its own properties and lin-
guistic realizations:
i) An autonym (see note 3): One or more self-
referential lexical items that are the logical or
grammatical subject of a predication that needs
not be a complete grammatical sentence.
3 At a very basic semiotic level natural language has
to be split (at least methodologically) into two distinct
systems that share the same rules and elements: a meta-
language, which is a language that is used to talk about
another one, and an object language, which in turn can
refer to and describe objects in the mind or in the
physical world. The two are isomorphic and this ac-
counts for reflexivity, the property of referring to itself,
as when linguistic items are mentioned instead of being
used normally in an utterance. Rey-Debove (1978) and
Carnap (1934) call this condition autonymy.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.827943666666667">
ii) An informative segment: a contribution of
relevant information about the meaning, status,
coding or interpretation of a linguistic unit. In-
formative segments constitute what we state
about the autonymical element.
iii) Markers/Operators: Elements used to mark
or made prominent whole discourse operation,
on account of its non-referential, metalinguis-
tic nature. They are usually lexical, typograp-
hic or pragmatic elements that articulate
autonyms and informative segments into a
predication.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.939116571428571">
Thus, in a sentence such as (2), the [autonym] is
marked in square brackets, the {informational
segment} in curly brackets and the &lt;marker-
operators&gt; in angular brackets:
(2) {The bit sequences representing quanta of
knowledge} &lt;will be called “&gt;[Kenes]&lt;”&gt;, {a
neologism intentionally similar to &apos;genes&apos;}.

2.2 Defaults, knowledge and knowledge of
language
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998548384615385">
The 5,400 metalinguistic sentences from our
BNC-based test corpus (henceforth, the EMO
corpus) reflect an important aspect of scientific
sublanguages, and of the scientific enterprise in
general. Whenever scientists and scholars advance
the state of the art of a discipline, the language
they use has to evolve and change, and this build-
up is carried out under metalinguistic control.
Previous knowledge is transformed into new
scientific common ground and ontological com-
mitments are introduced and defended when se-
mantic reference is established. That is why when
we want to structure and acquire new knowledge
we have to go through a resource-costly cognitive
process that integrates, within coherent conceptual
structures, a considerable amount of new and very
complex lexical items and terms.
It has to be pointed out that non-specialized
language is not abundant4 in these kinds of meta-
linguistic exchanges because (unless in the con-
text of language acquisition) we usually rely on a
lexical competence that, although subsequently
modified and enhanced, reaches the plateau of a
generalized lexicon relatively early in our adult
life. Technical terms can be thought of as seman-
tic anomalies, in the sense that they are ad hoc
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.4851435">
4 Our study shows that they represent between 1 and
6% of all sentences across different domains.

<bodyText confidence="0.999909736842105">
constructs strongly bounded to a model, a domain
or a context, and are not, by definition, part of the
far larger linguistic competence from a first native
language. The information provided by EMOs is
not usually inferable from previous one available
to the speaker’s community or expert group, and
does not depend on general language competence
by itself, but nevertheless is judged important and
relevant enough to warrant the additional proces-
sing effort involved.
Conventional resources like lexicons and dic-
tionaries compile established meaning definitions.
They can be seen as repositories of the default,
core lexical information of words or terms used by
a community (that is, the information available to
an average, idealized speaker). A Metalinguistic
Information Database (MID), on the other hand,
compiles the real-time data provided by metalan-
guage analysis of leading-edge research papers,
and can be conceptualized as an anti-dictionary: a
listing of exceptions, special contexts and specific
usage, of instances where meaning, value or
pragmatic conditions have been spotlighted by
discourse for cognitive reasons. The non-default
and highly relevant information from MIDs could
provide the material for new interpretation rules in
reasoning applications, when inferences won’t
succeed because the states of the lexico-
conceptual system have changed. When interpre-
ting text, regular lexical information is applied by
default under normal conditions, but more specific
pragmatic or discursive information can override
it if necessary, or if context demands so (Lascari-
des &amp; Copestake, 1995). A neologism or a word
in an unexpected technical sense could stump a
NLP system that assumes it will be able to use
default information from a machine-readable dic-
tionary.

3 Locating metalinguistic information in
text: two approaches
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.951276071428572">
When implementingan IE application to mine
metalinguistic information from text, the first is-
sue to tackle is how to obtain a reliable set of can-
didate sentences from free text for input into the
next phases of extraction. From our initial corpus
analysis we selected 44 patterns that showed the
best reliability for being EMO indicators. We start
our processing5 by tokenizing text, which then is
5 Our implementation is Python-based, using the
run through a cascade of finite-state devices based
on identification patterns that extract a candidate
set for filtering. Our filtering strategies in effect
distinguish between useful results such as (3)
from non-metalinguistic instances like (4):

<listItem confidence="0.9989014">
(3) Since the shame that was elicited by the co-
ding procedure was seldom explicitly mentio-
ned by the patient or the therapist, Lewis
called it unacknowledged shame.
(4) It was Lewis (1971;1976) who called attention
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.994760294117647">
to emotional elements in what until then had
been construed as a perceptual phenomenon .
For this task, we experimented with two strate-
gies: First, we used corpus-based collocations to
discard non-metalinguistic instances, for example
the presence of attention in sentence (4) next to
the marker called. Since immediate co-text seems
important for this classification task, we also im-
plemented learning algorithms that were trained
on a subset from our EMO corpus, using as vec-
tors either POS tags or word forms, at 1, 2, and 3
positions adjacent before and after our markers.
These approaches are representative of wider pa-
radigmatic approaches to NLP: symbolic and sta-
tistic techniques, each with their own advantages
and limitations. Our evaluations of the MOP sys-
tem are based on test runs over 3 document sets:
a) our original exploratory corpus of sociology
research papers [5581 sentences, 243 EMOs]; b)
an online histology textbook [5146 sentences, 69
EMOs] ; and c) a small sample from the MedLine
abstract database [1403 sentences, 10 EMOs].
Using collocational information, our first ap-
proach fared very well, presenting good precision
numbers, but not so encouraging recall. The so-
ciology corpus, for example, gave 0.94 precision
(P) and 0.68 recall (R), while the histology one
presented 0.9 P and 0.5 R. These low recall num-
bers reflect the fact that we only selected a subset
of the most reliable and common metalinguistic
patterns, and our list is not exhaustive. Example
(5) shows one kind of metalinguistic sentence
(with a copulative structure) attested in corpora,
NLTK toolkit (nltk.sf.net) developed by E. Loper and
S. Byrd at the University of Pennsylvania, although we
have replaced stochastic POS taggers with an imple-
mentation of the Brill algorithm by Hugo Liu at MIT.
Our output files follow XML standards to ensure
transparency, portability and accessibility
but that the system does not attempt to extract or
process:
(5) “Intercursive” power , on the other hand , is
power in Weber&apos;s sense of constraint by an ac-
tor or group of actors over others.
In order to better compare our two strategies,
we decided to also zoom in on a more limited sub-
set of verb forms for extraction (namely, calls,
called, call), which presented ratios of metalin-
guistic relevance in our MOP corpus, ranging
from 100% positives (for the pattern so called +
quotation marks) to 77% (called, by itself) to 31%
(call). Restricted to these verbs, our metrics show
precision and recall rates of around 0.97, and an
overall F-measure of 0.97.6 Of 5581 sentences (96
of which were metalinguistic sentences signaled
by our cluster of verbs), 83 were extracted, with
13 (or 15.6% of candidates) filtered-out by collo-
cations.
For our learning experiments (an approach we
have called contextual feature language models),
we selected two well-known algorithms that sho-
wed promise for this classification task.7 The nai-
ve Bayes (NB) algorithm estimates the conditional
probability of a set of features given a label, using
the product of the probabilities of the individual
features given that label. The Maximum Entropy
model establishes a probability distribution that
favors entropy, or uniformity, subject to the cons-
traints encoded in the feature-label correlation.
When training our ME classifiers, Generalized
(GISMax) and Improved Iterative Scaling (IIS-
Max) algorithms are used to estimate the optimal
maximum entropy of a feature set, given a corpus.
1,371 training sentences were converted into la-
beled vectors, for example using 3 positions and
POS tags: (&apos;VB WP NNP&apos;, &apos;calls&apos;, &apos;DT NN NN&apos;)
/&apos;YES&apos;@[102]. The different number of positions
considered to the left and right of the markers in
our training corpus, as well as the nature of the
features selected (there are many more word-types
than POS tags) ensured that our 3-part vector in-
troduced a wide range of features against our 2
possible YES-NO labels for processing by our
algorithms. Although our test runs using only co-
llocations showed initially that structural regulari-

ties would perform well, both with our restricted
lemma cluster and with our wider set of verbs and
markers, our intuitions about improvement with
more features (more positions to the right of left
of the markers) or a more controlled and gramma-
tically restricted environment (a finite set of su-
rrounding POS tags), turned out to be overly
optimistic. Nevertheless, stochastic approaches
that used short range features did perform very
well, in line with the hand-coded approach.

stricted to the lexeme call, are presented in Table
1, while Figures 1 and 2 present best results in the
learning experiments for the complete set of pat-

Both Knowledge-Engineering and supervised
learning approaches can be adequate for extrac-
tion of metalinguistic sentences, although learning
algorithms can be helpful when procedural rules
have not been compiled; they also allow easier
transport of systems to new thematic domains. We
plan further research into stochastic approaches to
fine tune them for the task.
One issue that merits special attention is why
some of the algorithms and features work well
with one corpus, but not so well with another.
This fact is in line with observations in Nigam et
al. (1999) that naive Bayes and Maximum Entro-
py do not show fundamental baseline superiori-
ties, but are dependent on other factors. A hybrid
approach that combines hand-crafted collocations
with classifiers customized to each pattern’s be-
havior and morpho-syntactic contexts in corpora
might offer better results in future experiments.
4 Processing EMOs to compile metalinguis-
tic information databases
Once we have extracted candidate EMOs, the
MOP system conforms to a general processing
architecture shown in Figure 3. POS tagging is
followed by shallow parsing that attempts limited
PP-attachment. The resulting chunks are then tag-
ged semantically as Autonyms, Agents, Markers,
Anaphoric elements or simply as Noun Chunks,
using heuristics based on syntactic, pragmatic and
argument structure observation of the extraction
patterns.
Next, a predicate processing phase selects the
most likely surface realization of informational
segments, autonyms and makers-operators, and
proceeds to fill the templates in our databases.
This was done by following different processing
routes customized for each pattern using corpus
analysis as well as FrameNet data from Name
conferral and Name bearing frames to establish
relevant arguments and linguistic realizations.

As mentioned earlier, informational segments
present many realizations that distance them from
the clarity, completeness and conciseness of lexi-
cographic entries. In fact, they may show up as
full-fledged clauses (6), as inter- or intra-
sentential anaphoric elements (7 and 8, the first
one a relative clause), supply a categorization de-
scriptor (9), or even (10) restrict themselves se-
mantically to what we could call a sententially-
unrealized “existential variable” (with logical
form x) indicating only that certain discourse
entity is being introduced.

module in our present system, so that instances 7,

solved surface element or as existential variable
place-holders,9 but these issues will be explored in
future versions of the system. Nevertheless, much
more common occurrences as in (11) and (12) are
enough to create MIDs quite useful for lexicogra-
phers and for NLP lexical resources.

The DEFINDER system (Klavans et al, 2001) at
Columbia University is, to my knowledge, the
only one fully comparable with MOP, both in
scope and goals, but some basic differences be-
tween them exist. First, DEFINDER examines
user-oriented documents that are bound to contain
fully-developed definitions for the layman, as the
general goal of the PERSIVAL project is to pre-
sent medical information to patients in a less tech-
nical language than the one of reference literature.
MOP focuses on leading-edge research papers that
present the less predictable informational templa-
tes of highly technical language. Secondly, by the
very nature of DEFINDER’s goals their qualitati-
ve evaluation criteria include readability, useful-
ness and completeness as judged by lay subjects,
criteria which we have not adopted here. Neither
have we determined coverage against existing on-
line dictionaries, as they have done. Taking into
account the above-mentioned differences between
the two systems’ methods and goals, MOP com-
pares well with the 0.8 Precision and 0.75 Recall
of DEFINDER. While the resulting MOP “defini-
tions” generally do not present high readability or
completeness, these informational segments are
not meant to be read by laymen, but used by do-
main lexicographers reviewing existing glossaries
for neological change, or, for example, in machi-
ne-readable form by applications that attempt au-
tomatic categorization for semantic rerendering of
an expert ontology, since definitional contexts
provide sortal information as a natural part of the
process of precisely situating a term or concept
against the meaning network of interrelated lexi-
cal items. The Metalinguistic Information Databa-
ses in their present form are not, in full justice,
lexical knowledge bases comparable with the
highly-structured and sophisticated resources that
use inheritance and typed features, like LKB (Co-
pestake et al., 1993). MIDs are semi-structured
resources (midway between raw corpora and
structured lexical bases) that can be further pro-
cessed to convert them into usable data sources,
along the lines suggested by Vossen and Copesta-
ke (1993) for the syntactic kernels of lexicograp-
hic definitions, or by Pustejovsky et al. (2002)
using corpus analytics to increase the semantic
type coverage of the NLM UMLS ontology. An-
other interesting possibility is to use a dynami-
cally-updated MID to trace the conceptual and
terminological evolution of a discipline.
We believe that low recall rates in our tests are
in part due to the fact that we are dealing with the
wider realm of metalinguistic information, as op-
posed to structured definitional sentences that
have been distilled by an expert for consumer-
oriented documents. We have opted in favor of
exploiting less standardized, non-default metalin-
guistic information that is being put forward in
text because it can’t be assumed to be part of the
collective expert-domain competence (Section
2.1). In doing so, we have exposed our system to
the less predictable and highly charged lexical
environment of leading-edge research literature,
the cauldron where knowledge and terminological
systems are forged in real time, and where scienti-
fic meaning and interpretation are constantly de-
bated, modified and agreed. We have not per-
formed major customization of the system (like
enriching the tagging lexicon with medical terms),
in order to preserve the ability to use the system
across different domains. Domain customization
may improve metrics, but at a cost for portability.
The implementation we have described here
undoubtedly shows room for improvement in so-
me areas, including: adding other patterns for bet-
ter overall recall rates, deeper parsing for more
accurate semantic typing of sentence arguments,
etc. Also, the issue of which learning algorithms
can better perform the initial filtering of EMO
candidates is still very much an open question.
Applications that can turn MIDs into truly useful
lexical resources by further processing them need
to be written. We plan to continue development of
our proof-of-concept system to explore those ar-
eas. DEFINDER and MOP both show great poten-
tial as robust lexical acquisition systems capable
of handling the vast electronic resources available
today to researchers and laymen alike, helping to
make them more accessible and useful. In doing
so, they are also fulfilling the promise of NLP
techniques as mature and practical technologies.

The non-default and highly relevant information from MIDs could provide the material for new interpretation rules in reasoning applications, when inferences won’t succeed because the states of the lexicoconceptual system have changed. When interpreting text, regular lexical information is applied by default under normal conditions, but more specific pragmatic or discursive information can override it if necessary, or if context demands so (Lascarides &amp; Copestake, 1995). A neologism or a word in an unexpected technical sense could stump a NLP system that assumes it will be able to use default information from a machine-readable dictionary. 3 Locating metalinguistic information in text: two approaches When implementingan IE application to mine metalinguistic information from text, the first issue to tackle is how to obtain a reliable set of candidate sentences from free text for input into the next phases of extraction.

We plan further research into stochastic approaches to fine tune them for the task. One issue that merits special attention is why some of the algorithms and features work well with one corpus, but not so well with another. This fact is in line with observations in Nigam et al. (1999) that naive Bayes and Maximum Entropy do not show fundamental baseline superiorities, but are dependent on other factors. A hybrid approach that combines hand-crafted collocations with classifiers customized to each pattern’s behavior and morpho-syntactic contexts in corpora might offer better results in future experiments. 4 Processing EMOs to compile metalinguistic information databases Once we have extracted candidate EMOs, the MOP system conforms to a general processing architecture shown in Figure 3.

The kind of categorization information implicit in many definitions can help improve anaphora resolution, semantic typing or acronym identification in these corpora, as well as enhance “semantic rerendering” of special-domain ontologies and thesaurii (Pustejovsky et al., 2002).

They are usually lexical, typographic or pragmatic elements that articulate autonyms and informative segments into a predication. Thus, in a sentence such as (2), the [autonym] is mark</context>

Although mining specific semantic relations and subcategorization information from free-text has been successfully carried out in the past (Hearst, 1999; Manning, 1993), automatically extracting lexical resources (including terminological definitions) from text in special domains has been a field less explored, but recent experiences (Klavans et al., 2001; Rodríguez, 2001; Cartier, 1998) show that compiling the extensive resources that modern scientific and technical disciplines need in order to manage the explosive growth of their knowledge, is both feasible and practical. A good example of this NLP-based processing need is the MedLine abstract database maintained by the National Library of Medicine1 (NLM), which incorporates around 40,000 Health Sciences papers each month. Researchers depend on these electronic resources to keep abreast of their rapidly changing field. In order to maintain and update vital indexing references such as the Unified Medical Lang</context>

The Metalinguistic Information Databases in their present form are not, in full justice, lexical knowledge bases comparable with the highly-structured and sophisticated resources that use inheritance and typed features, like LKB (Copestake et al., 1993). MIDs are semi-structured resources (midway between raw corpora and structured lexical bases) that can be further processed to convert them into usable data sources, along the lines suggested by Vossen and Copestake (1993) for the syntactic kernels of lexicographic definitions, or by Pustejovsky et al. (2002) using corpus analytics to increase the semantic type coverage of the NLM UMLS ontology. Another interesting possibility is to use a dynamically-updated MID to trace the conceptual and terminological evolution of a discipline. We believe that low recall rates in our tests are in part due to the fact that we are dealing with the wider realm of metalinguistic information, as opposed to structured definitional sentences that have been distilled by an expert for consumeroriented documents.
