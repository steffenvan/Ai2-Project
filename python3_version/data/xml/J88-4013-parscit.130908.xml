And from this it follows that weak generative capac-
ity, as usually conceived, cannot be the right notion of
complexity to study in connection with human language
(even if it were to be measured by a yardstick different
from the Chomsky hierarchy).
Important as the three papers I have mentioned are,
my favorite is the previously unpublished—and, this
time, brand new—paper by Savitch on context-sensitive
grammars. Most of the mathematics underlying the
theory of computation and mathematical linguistics is
familiar, but the implications of these results for empir-
ical science are rarely discussed explicitly in the litera-
ture, and are not widely known. Savitch&apos;s contribution
is one of the few places where a humdrum formal result,
which has been known for a number of years, comes to
life.
The point is essentially this: we know that the
recursively enumerable (r.e.) languages are accepted by
Turing machines, which may use an arbitrary amount of
tape before accepting a given string, whereas the CSLs
are accepted by (non-deterministic) TMs which have a
certain (linear) bound on the amount of tape that may be
used. Now, given any r.e. language, we can construct a
rather similar CSL, in which the extra tape that was
required for the computation is built into the input. To
do this, a string of special marker symbols is appended
to the end of the real input. A computation proceeds as
it would in the original (unbounded) TM except that the
marked cells are used instead of blank ones. If the TM
runs out of the marked cells to hold intermediate
results, then the computation is aborted without accept-
ing. Intuitively, then, the CSL accepted is not very
different from the underlying r.e. language, and we see
that each r.e. language can be encoded as a CSL.
Moreover, the process of converting this CSL to the
underlying r.e. language is trivial: delete the marker
symbols (though there is no algorithm for going from the
r.e. language to the CSL).
Savitch argues, convincingly to my mind, that all this
indicates that CSLs have all the structural complexity of
r.e. languages, and hence are not suitable as a model of
human language—or anything else. We have all been
taught to think of the r.e. languages as including &amp;quot;every-
thing&amp;quot;, but in a real sense, so do the CSLs. For years,
there was a feeling that recursiveness was something to
strive for, but now we see that this was much too
modest a goal. If human languages are characterized by
certain structural universals (e.g., they all use redupli-
cation but not prime length of a string as a grammatical
device), then CSLs are already much too inclusive, for
they contain all languages that can be characterized in
such structural terms. Savitch&apos;s , contribution should
help open up the heavily fortified border between the
mathematical theory of computation and empirical sci-
ence. Perhaps it will be the beginning of a beautiful
friendship.
In sum, this book is well worth careful study. It is by
no means the last word on the subject, but for many it
may well be the first word, and Savitch et al. have done
an excellent job, both in their selections and in their
commentaries, of giving a solid introduction to a
sparsely cultivated but already complex field. They
have also done much to foster the dissemination and the
comprehension of formal complexity results in linguis-
tics and to encourage accuracy and lucidity in the
formulation, presentation, and interpretation of such
results.

1. Ziff (1960, pp.85-86) drew a different conclusion, namely, that
proper names are not words, but this would still spell the end of
any real raison d&apos;etre for weak generative capacity studies in
linguistics, since now when we look at sentences of a human
language we must somehow distinguish those containing names

David Crystal is well known as a linguist who has worked in
such assorted areas as stylistics and language pathology. In
addition to his research writings, he is also a popularizer of
linguistics, being the author of an introductory book and a
radio broadcaster in the U.K.
The present volume is also aimed at the general public, and
is a particularly ambitious attempt to present the fascination
(and breadth) of the sciences of language. Topics covered
Computational Linguistics, Volume 14, Number 4, December 1988 103
Book Reviews Briefly Noted
include such diverse matters as language typology, verbal
taboos, the relationship between blood groups and dental
fricatives, methods of teaching second languages, theories of
hearing, how to buy a dictionary, suprasegmental analysis,
spelling reform, cohesion in discourse, the history of linguis-
tics, and calligraphy.
Despite its title, the book is not an encyclopedia in the
usual sense: it is by a single author, is arranged in a conceptual
hierarchy rather than alphabetical order, and is not really a
reference book (although in some places the material is
comprehensive enough for reference use). There are 65 arti-
cles, each from 2 to 18 (large) pages. The articles include many
boxes, sidebars, pictures, and, occasionally, puzzles, in addi-
tion to the main text. While much of the material will be
familiar to readers of this journal whose background is pri-
marily in linguistics, chances are that they will still find
something new and fascinating in this book. Readers who
have come to computational linguistics through computer
science and artificial intelligence will find it an entertaining
way to broaden their background. —G.H.

The recent ascendency of computerized thoughtways con-
stitutes a profound alteration in the system of world culture.
. . . Among other outcomes, it has energized a recurrent
modern wish to produce a wholly logical, univocal system
of language.
Some devotees of this process have sought to map human
&amp;quot;natural&amp;quot; language onto a computer program. This goal,
however, has recently been pronounced futile by even its
most dedicated proponents, who have come to conclude
that for all the phonological, morphological, grammatical,
syntactical, and semantic rules that govern them, natural
languages remain incorrigibly ambiguous.
Although this conclusion seems maddening to computer
scientists, is it really so unfortunate? Partly yes, partly no
. . . .
This book expresses my deep conviction that the proper
stance of moderns towards ambiguous language and thought
is one of pronounced ambivalence. —From the preface

Recent years have witnessed a growing interest in cogni-
tive linguistics, a framework aiming at an adequate account
of the relationship between language and cognition and as
such involving human psychology, interpersonal relations,
culture, and a host of other domains. Our purpose has been
to present the theoretical premises of this framework and
to explore its descriptive and explanatory potential with
respect to a wide range of language phenomena. In pursu-
ing this goal, we have frequently relied on corpus analyses,
intensive field work, and other means of empirical verifi-
cation. Crossing the boundaries of particular languages or
language families has led additional support to the findings
emerging from our research. —From the preface

NATURAL LANGUAGE AND VOICE PROCESSING: AN ASSESSMENT OF
TECHNOLOGY AND APPLICATIONS

Why would someone pay hundreds of dollars for a report on
an assessment of natural language technology when they
could buy a text book and a subscription to Computational
Linguistics for a fraction of the price? Such a report could well
be worth the price to someone charged with making corporate
policy on technology if it accurately digests information about
current technology, gives credible projections of what will
happen soon, and points the reader to useful sources, people,
and organizations. The report by Tim Johnson (1985) did this
well (see Jones&apos;s (1986) review in these pages).
Unfortunately, this new report, by Terri Walker and Rich-
ard Miller of SEA! Technical Publications, does not measure
up to this standard. It catalogues, but it does little to digest or
explain. For example, under the heading &amp;quot;Research groups to
watch&amp;quot;, there are 84 pages listing projects by 65 groups. But
the listings seem to be mostly public-relations blurbs, many of
them rather out of date, written by the groups themselves;
there is no attempt to edit or interpret. Likewise, the chapter
&amp;quot;Commercial NL software&amp;quot; seems to be directly copied from
advertising or p.r. material. The technical introduction to
NLU is also unoriginal; it is reprinted directly from a public-
domain NASA technical memorandum by William Gevarter,
first published in April 1983.
But the main problems with the report seem to stem from
the author-editors&apos; apparently limited understanding of the
field they profess to be assessing. The clearest demonstration
of this (apart from their general failure to provide much
interpretation of, or editorial judgment upon, the material they
have collected) is their treatment of Weizenbaum&apos;s famous
Eliza program. In the chapter entitled &amp;quot;Early research in
NLP&amp;quot;, Eliza is described as being &amp;quot;first written as a joke and
then taken seriously . . . . When it became clear that people
liked Eliza and were often more honest talking to a computer
than they would be talking to a human therapist, the stage was
set for the development of more therapeutic software.&amp;quot; Un-
fortunately, it seems that Walker and Miller are among those
who take Eliza seriously, for it turns up again in the chapter on
commercial NLP systems; a commercial version of the pro-
gram (presumably sold as a game) is given equal billing with
Artificial Intelligence Corporation&apos;s INTELLECT, Syman-
tec&apos;s Q&amp;A, and the Carnegie Group&apos;s Language Craft. (Inci-
dentally, Dyer&apos;s BORIS program (1983), perhaps the most
sophisticated story understander yet constructed, is also listed
as an example of &amp;quot;early research in NLP&amp;quot;.)
The chapter called &amp;quot;Market analysis and forecast&amp;quot; is all of
two pages long. It briefly quotes other sources (including
Johnson) to say that the market will go up.
It should also be mentioned that for $285, one expects the
material to be presented with care. However, the proofreading
seems to have mostly been by a spelling-checking program
rather than a human; names are sometimes misspelled, but
regular words of English never are, although on occasion they
are anagrams or other variants of the words the writer clearly
intended. A human copyeditor does, however, seem to have
attended to the section on ill-formed input, where the exam-
ples of syntactically ill-formed text (taken from work by
Charniak) have all been &amp;quot;corrected&amp;quot;, thereby making the
discussion rather weird. —G.H.

In this book it is argued that linguistics (as studied through
grammar) is not a scientific discipline. Basically, Yngve&apos;s
argument focuses on the claim that linguistics is the scientific
study of language. He argues that language, the object of
study in linguistics, has no corresponding real-world object
and hence cannot be tested against physical reality—a neces-
sary criterion, Yngve claims, for a scientific study. On the
basis of this, he concludes that &amp;quot;language is not something
that can be studied scientifically in any strict sense; and it is
not an abstraction or model or theory of anything, for there is
nothing for it to be an abstraction, model or theory of&amp;quot; (p. 16).
Any claim that linguistics is the scientific study of language
cannot, Yngve maintains, be coherent.
To avoid this inherent contradiction, Yngve proposes the
study of &amp;quot;human linguistics&amp;quot;—namely, a scientific study of
people and how they communicate. The theory is set out in
terms of properties that are observable in the communicative
behaviour of particular individuals. Properties can change
through time and can have a causal effect on other properties.
Yngve outlines a preliminary notational system for expressing
these properties and &amp;quot;observationally based&amp;quot; general laws
governing these properties. This book does not provide a fully
fleshed-out alternative to current linguistic theories. The point
at issue here is not the details of the theory, but rather the
foundations and basic assumptions of the theory. After reeval-
uating the theoretical underpinnings of linguistic theory,
Yngve outlines a new basis that he argues will avoid some of
the fundamental problems in linguistic theory.
Throughout the book, Yngve&apos;s arguments are interesting,
certainly controversial, and intent on shaking up the &amp;quot;busi-
ness as usual&amp;quot; acceptance of assumptions on the authority of
tradition that is found in many linguistic theories. Whether
this new &amp;quot;scientific&amp;quot; foundation for linguistics will prove as
promising as Yngve suggests remains to be seen. The task
Yngve sets for himself is certainly a formidable one, and there
remain a large number of questions and issues that will need to
be addressed before &amp;quot;scientific&amp;quot; linguistics can be viewed as
a viable working alternative to the mainstream linguistic
theories.
