We present some variations affecting the
association measure and thresholding on
a technique for learning Selectional Re-
strictions from on-line corpora. It uses
a wide-coverage noun taxonomy and a
statistical measure to generalize the ap-
propriate semantic classes. Evaluation
measures for the Selectional Restrictions
learning task are discussed. Finally, an
experimental evaluation of these varia-
tions is reported.

<bodyText confidence="0.999936727272727">
In recent years there has been a common agree-
ment in the NLP research community on the im-
portance of having an extensive coverage of selec-
tional restrictions (SRs) tuned to the domain to
work with. SRs can be seen as semantic type con-
straints that a word sense imposes on the words
with which it combines in the process of seman-
tic interpretation. SRs may have different ap-
plications in NLP, specifically, they may help a
parser with Word Sense Selection (WSS, as in
(Hirst, 1987)), with preferring certain structures
out of several grammatical ones (Whittemore et
al., 1990) and finally with deciding the semantic
role played by a syntactic complement (Basili et
al., 1992). Lexicography is also interested in the
acquisition of SRs (both defining in context ap-
proach and lexical semantics work (Levin, 1992)).
The aim of our work is to explore the feasibil-
ity of using an statistical method for extracting
SRs from on-line corpora. Resnik (1992) devel-
oped a method for automatically extracting class-
based SRs from on-line corpora. Ribas (1994a)

The technique functionality can be summarized
as:
Input The training set, i.e. a list of
complement co-occurrence triples, (verb-
lemma, syntactic-relationship, noun-lemma)
extracted from the corpus.
Previous knowledge used A semantic hierar-
chy (WordNetl) where words are clustered in
semantic classes, and semantic classes are or-
ganized hierarchically. Polysemous words are
represented as instances of different classes.
Output A set of syntac-
tic SRs, (verb-lemma, syntactic-relationship,
semantic-class, weight). The final SRs must
be mutually disjoint. SRs are weighted ac-
cording to the statistical evidence found in
the corpus.

The appropriateness of a class for expressing
SRs (stage 2) is quantified from the strength of
co-occurrence of verbs and classes of nouns in the.
corpus (Resnik, 1992). Given the verb v, the
syntactic-relationship s and the candidate class c,
the Association Score, Assoc, between v and c in
s is defined:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.997767">
Assoc(v, s, c) = p(clv, s)I(v; els)
= p(clv s) log *iv&apos; s)

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9926185">
The two terms of Assoc try to capture different
properties:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9690005">
1. Mutual information ratio, /(v; e)s), measures
the strength of the statistical association be-
tween the given verb v and the candidate
class c in the given syntactic position s. It
compares the prior distribution, p(c1s), with
the posterior distribution, p(clv, s).
2. p(clv, , s) scales up the strength of the associ-
ation by the frequency of the relationship.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99765225">
Probabilities are estimated by Maximum Likeli-
hood Estimation (MLE), i.e. counting the relative
frequency of the considered events in the corpus2.
However, it is not obvious how to calculate class
frequencies when the training corpus is not seman-
tically tagged as is the case. Nevertheless, we take
a simplistic approach and calculate them in the
following manner:
</bodyText>

When creating the space of candidate classes
(learning process, stage 1), we use a threshold-
jug technique to ignore as much as possible the
noise introduced in the training set. Specifically,
we consider only those classes that have a higher
number of occurrences than the threshold. The
selection of the most appropriate classes (stage 3)
is based on a global search through the candidates,
in such a way that the final classes are mutually
disjoint (not related by hyperonymy).

<bodyText confidence="0.999372666666667">
Ribas (1994a) reported experimental results ob-
tained from the application of the above technique
to learn SRs. He performed an evaluation of the
Sits obtained from a training set of 870,000 words
of the Wall Street Journal. In this section we sum-
marize the results and conclusions reached in that
paper.
For instance, table 1 shows the SRs acquired
for the subject position of the verb seek. Type indi-
cates a manual diagnosis about the class appropri-
ateness (Ok: correct; itAbs: over-generalization;
Senses: due to erroneous senses). Assoc cor-
responds to the association score (higher values
appear first). Most of the induced classes are
due to incorrect senses. Thus, although suit was
used in the WSJ articles only in the sense of
&lt; legal_action &gt; , the algorithm not only consid-
ered the other senses as well (&lt; suit, suing &gt;,&lt;

1 without introducing normalization. Therefore, the
</footnote>

estimated function didn&apos;t accomplish probability ax-
ioms. Nevertheless, their results should be equivalent
(for our purposes) to those introducing normalization
because it shouldn&apos;t affect the relative ordering of As-
soc among rival candidate classes for the same (v, s).

suii_of _clothes&gt;, &lt; suit&gt;) , but the Assoc score
ranked them higher than the appropriate sense.
We can also notice that the frAbs class, &lt;group&gt;,
seems too general for the example nouns, while
one of its daughters, &lt; people &gt; seems to fit the
data much better.
Analyzing the results obtained from different
experimental evaluation methods, Ribas (1994a)
drew up some conclusions:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.916356142857143">
a. The technique achieves a good coverage.
b. Most of the classes acquired result from the
accumulation of incorrect senses.
c. No clear co-relation between Assoc and the
manual diagnosis is found.
d. A slight tendency to over-generalization exists
due to incorrect senses.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999683166666667">
Although the performance of the presented
technique seems to be quite good, we think that
some of the detected flaws could possibly be ad-
dressed. Noise due to polysemy of the nouns in-
volved seems to be the main obstacle for the prac-
ticality of the technique. It makes the association
score prefer incorrect classes and jump on over-
generalizations. In this paper we are interested
in exploring various ways to make the technique
more robust to noise, namely, (a) to experiment
with variations of the association score, (b) to ex-
periment with thresholding.

3 Variations on the association
statistical measure
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999565">
In this section we consider different variations on
the association score in order to make it more ro-
bust. The different techniques are experimentally
evaluated in section 4.2.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.981594">
3.1 Variations on the prior probability
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9990186">
When considering the prior probability, the more
independent of the context it is the better to mea-
sure actual associations. A sensible modification
of the measure would be to consider p(c) as the
prior distribution:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.628713">
p(c)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999812333333333">
Using the chain rule on mutual information
(Cover and Thomas, 1991, p. 22) we can mathe-
matically relate the different versions of Assoc,
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.713759">
Assoc&apos; (v, s, = p(clv, s) log p(cls) +Assoc(v, s, c)
p(c)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.994884027777778">
The first advantage of Assoc&apos; would come from
this (information theoretical) relationship. Specif-
ically, the Assoc&apos; takes into account the prefer-
ence (selection) of syntactic positions for partic-
ular classes. In intuitive terms, typical subjects
(e.g. &lt;person, individual, ...&gt;) would be preferred
(to atypical subjects as &lt;suit_of_clothes&gt;) as SRs
on the subject in contrast to Assoc. The second
advantage is that as long as the prior probabili-
ties, p(c), involve simpler events than those used
in Assoc, p(c1s), the estimation is easier and more
accurate (ameliorating data sparseness).
A subsequent modification would be to estimate
the prior, p(c), from the counts of all the nouns ap-
pearing in the corpus independently of their syn-
tactic positions (not restricted to be heads of ver-
bal complements). In this way, the estimation of
p(c) would be easier and more accurate.
3.2 Estimating class probabilities from
noun frequencies
In the global weighting technique presented in
equation 2 very polysemous nouns provide the
same amount of evidence to every sense as non-
ambiguous nouns do —while less ambiguous nouns
could be more informative about the correct
classes as long as they do not carry ambiguity.
The weight introduced in (1) could alternatively
be found in a local manner, in such a way that
more polysemous nouns would give less evidence
to each one of their senses than less ambiguous
ones. Local weight could be obtained using p(cln).
Nevertheless, a good estimation of this probabil-
ity seems quite problematic because of the lack of
tagged training material. In absence of a better
estimator we use a rather poor one as the uniform
distribution,

Isenses(n)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.970657307692308">
Resnik (1993) also uses a local normalization
technique but he normalizes by the total number
of classes in the hierarchy. This scheme seems
to present two problematic features (see (Ribas,
1994b) for more details). First, it doesn&apos;t take
dependency relationships introduced by hyper-
onymy into account. Second, nouns categorized in
lower levels in the taxonomy provide less weight
to each class than higher nouns.
3.3 Other statistical measures to score
SRs
In this section we propose the application of other
measures apart from Assoc for learning SRs: log-
likelihood ratio (Dunning, 1993), relative entropy
(Cover and Thomas, 1991), mutual information
ratio (Church and Hanks, 1990), 02 (Gale and
Church, 1991). In section (4) their experimental
evaluation is presented.
The statistical measures used to detect associ-
ations on the distribution defined by two random
variables X and Y work by measuring the devia-
tion of the conditional distribution, P(XIY), from
the expected distribution if both variables were
considered independent, i.e. the marginal distri-
bution, P (X). If P (X) is a good approximation
Assoc&apos; (v, s, c) = p(clv, s) log kciv, s)

of P(XIY), association measures should be low
(near zero), otherwise deviating significantly from
zero.
Table 2 shows the cross-table formed by the con-
ditional and marginal distributions in the case of
X = {c, -,c} and Y = {v_s, -,v_s). Different asso-
ciation measures use the information provided in
the cross-table to different extents. Thus, Assoc
and mutual information ratio consider only the
deviation of the conditional probability p(civ, s)
from the corresponding marginal, p(c).
On the other hand, log-likelihood ratio and 02
measure the association between v_s and c con-
sidering the deviation of the four conditional cells
in table 2 from the corresponding marginals. It is
plausible that the deviation of the cells not taken
into account by Assoc can help on extracting use-
ful SRs.
Finally, it would be interesting to only use the
information related to the selectional behavior of
v_s, i.e. comparing the conditional probabilities
of c and given v_s with the corresponding
marginals. Relative entropy, D(P(Xlv_s)11P(X)),
could do this job.

4.1 Evaluation methods of SRs
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999985909090909">
Evaluation on NLP has been crucial to fostering
research in particular areas. Evaluation of the SR
learning task would provide grounds to compare
different techniques that try to abstract SRs from
corpus using WordNet (e.g, section 4.2). It would
also permit measuring the utility of the SRs ob-
tained using WordNet in comparison with other
frameworks using other kinds of knowledge. Fi-
nally it would be a powerful tool for detecting
flaws of a particular technique (e.g, (Ribas, 1994a)
analysis).
However, a related and crucial issue is which
linguistic tasks are used as a reference. SRs are
useful for both lexicography and NLP. On the one
hand, from the point of view of lexicography, the
goal of evaluation would be to measure the quality
of the SRs induced, (i.e., how well the resulting
classes correspond to the nouns as they were used
in the corpus). On the other hand, from the point
of view of NLP, SRs should be evaluated on their
utility (i.e., how much they help on performing
the reference task).

<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.958749">
4.1.1 Lexicography-oriented evaluation
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999852833333333">
As far as lexicography (quality) is concerned,
we think the main criteria SRs acquired from cor-
pora should meet are: (a) correct categorization
-inferred classes should correspond to the correct
senses of the words that are being generalized-,
(b) appropriate generalization level and (c) good
coverage -the majority of the noun occurrences in
the corpus should be successfully generalized by
the induced SRs.
Some of the methods we could use for assessing
experimentally the accomplishment of these crite-
ria would be:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.944332666666667">
• Introspection A lexicographer checks if the
SRs accomplish the criteria (a) and (b) above
(e.g., the manual diagnosis in table 1). Be-
sides the intrinsic difficulties of this approach,
it does not seem appropriate when comparing
across different techniques for learning SRs,
because of its qualitative flavor.
• Quantification of generalization level
appropriateness A possible measure would
be the percentage of sense occurrences in-
cluded in the induced SRs which are effec-
tively correct (from now on called Abstraction
Ratio). Hopefully, a technique with a higher
abstraction ratio learns classes that fit the set
of examples better. A manual assessment of
the ratio confirmed this behavior, as testing
sets with a lower ratio seemed to be inducing
less 1lAbs cases.
• Quantification of coverage It could be
measured as the proportion of triples whose
correct sense belongs to one of the SRs.

4.1.2 NLP evaluation tasks
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999966652173913">
The NLP tasks where SRs utility could be eval-
uated are diverse. Some of them have already
been introduced in section 1. In the recent lit-
erature aGrishman and Sterling, 1992), (Resnik,
1993), ...) several task oriented schemes to test
Selectional Restrictions (mainly on syntactic am-
biguity resolution) have been proposed. However,
we have tested SRs on a WSS task, using the
following scheme. For every triple in the testing
set the algorithm selects as most appropriate that
noun-sense that has as hyperonym the SR class
with highest association score. When more than
one sense belongs to the highest SR, a random
selection is performed. When no SR has been ac-
quired, the algorithm remains undecided. The re-
sults of this WSS procedure are checked against a
testing-sample manually analyzed, and precision
and recall ratios are calculated. Precision is cal-
culated as the ratio of manual-automatic matches
/ number of noun occurrences disambiguated by
the procedure. Recall is computed as the ratio
of manual-automatic matches / total number of
noun occurrences.

In order to evaluate the different variants on the
association score and the impact of thresholding
we performed several experiments. In this section
we analyze the results. As training set we used
the 870,000 words of WSJ material provided in
the ACL/DCI version of the Penn Treebank. The
testing set consisted of 2,658 triples corresponding
to four average common verbs in the Treebank:
rise, report, seek and present. We only considered
those triples that had been correctly extracted
from the Treebank and whose noun had the cor-
rect sense included in WordNet (2,165 triples out
of the 2,658, from now on, called the testing-
sample).
As evaluation measures we used coverage, ab-
straction ratio, and recall and precision ratios on
the WSS task (section 4.1). In addition we per-
formed some evaluation by hand comparing the
SRs acquired by the different techniques.

Coverage for the different techniques is shown
in table 3. The higher the coverage, the better the
technique succeeds in correctly generalizing more
of the input examples. The labels used for re-
ferring to the different techniques are as follows:

the local normalization (section 3.2), and finally,
log-likelihood, D (relative entropy) and I (mutual
information ratio) to the techniques discussed in
section 3.3.
The abstraction ratio for the different tech-

abstraction ratio, the better the technique suc-

task for the different techniques are shown in ta-

for different phenomena the goodness of a partic-

In this paper we have presented some variations
affecting the association measure and thresholding
on the basic technique for learning SRs from on-
line corpora. We proposed some evaluation mea-
sures for the SRs learning task. Finally, experi-
mental results on these variations were reported.
We can conclude that some of these variations
seem to improve the results obtained using the
basic technique. However, although the technique
still seems far from practical application to NLP
tasks, it may be most useful for providing exper-
imental insight to lexicographers. Future lines of
research will mainly concentrate on improving the
local normalization technique by solving the noun
sense ambiguity. We have foreseen the application
of the following techniques:

Some of them have already been introduced in section 1. In the recent literature aGrishman and Sterling, 1992), (Resnik, 1993), ...) several task oriented schemes to test Selectional Restrictions (mainly on syntactic ambiguity resolution) have been proposed. However, we have tested SRs on a WSS task, using the following scheme. For every triple in the testing set the algorithm selects as most appropriate that noun-sense that has as hyperonym the SR class with highest association score. When more than one sense belongs to the highest SR, a random selection is performed. When no SR has been acquired, the algorithm remains undecided.

However, it is not obvious how to calculate class frequencies when the training corpus is not semantically tagged as is the case.

In absence of a better estimator we use a rather poor one as the uniform distribution, isenses(n) E cl w(n, c) = Isenses(n) Resnik (1993) also uses a local normalization technique but he normalizes by the total number of classes in the hierarchy. This scheme seems to present two problematic features (see (Ribas, 1994b) for more details). First, it doesn&apos;t take dependency relationships introduced by hyperonymy into account. Second, nouns categorized in lower levels in the taxonomy provide less weight to each class than higher nouns. 3.3 Other statistical measures to score SRs In this section we propose the application of other measures apart from Assoc for learning SRs: loglikelihood ratio (Dunning, 1993), relative entropy (Cove</context>

Some of them have already been introduced in section 1. In the recent literature aGrishman and Sterling, 1992), (Resnik, 1993), ...) several task oriented schemes to test Selectional Restrictions (mainly on syntactic ambiguity resolution) have been proposed. However, we have tested SRs on a WSS task, using the following scheme. For every triple in the testing set the algorithm selects as most appropriate that noun-sense that has as hyperonym the SR class with highest association score. When more than one sense belongs to the highest SR, a random selection is performed. When no SR has been acquired, the algorithm remains undecided.

Subject Areas: corpus-based language modeling, computational lexicography 1 Introduction In recent years there has been a common agreement in the NLP research community on the importance of having an extensive coverage of selectional restrictions (SRs) tuned to the domain to work with. SRs can be seen as semantic type constraints that a word sense imposes on the words with which it combines in the process of semantic interpretation. SRs may have different applications in NLP, specifically, they may help a parser with Word Sense Selection (WSS, as in (Hirst, 1987)), with preferring certain structures out of several grammatical ones (Whittemore et al., 1990) and finally with deciding the semantic role played by a syntactic complement (Basili et al., 1992). Lexicography is also interested in the acquisition of SRs (both defining in context approach and lexical semantics work (Levin, 1992)). The aim of our work is to explore the feasibility of using an statistical method for extracting SRs from on-line corpora.

The appropriateness of a class for expressing SRs (stage 2) is quantified from the strength of co-occurrence of verbs and classes of nouns in the. corpus (Resnik, 1992). Given the verb v, the syntactic-relationship s and the candidate class c, the Association Score, Assoc, between v and c in s is defined: Assoc(v, s, c) = p(clv, s)I(v; els) = p(clv s) log *iv&apos; s) P(cs) The two terms of Assoc try to capture different properties: 1.

Evaluation of the SR learning task would provide grounds to compare different techniques that try to abstract SRs from corpus using WordNet (e.g, section 4.2). It would also permit measuring the utility of the SRs obtained using WordNet in comparison with other frameworks using other kinds of knowledge. Finally it would be a powerful tool for detecting flaws of a particular technique (e.g, (Ribas, 1994a) analysis). However, a related and crucial issue is which linguistic tasks are used as a reference. SRs are useful for both lexicography and NLP. On the one hand, from the point of view of lexicography, the goal of evaluation would be to measure the quality of the SRs induced, (i.e., how well the resulting classes correspond to the nouns as they were used in the corpus). On the other hand, from the point of view of NLP, SRs should be evaluated on their utility (i.e., how much they help on performing the reference task). 4.1.1 Lexicography-oriented evaluation As far as lexicography (quality) </context>

Specifically, we consider only those classes that have a higher number of occurrences than the threshold. The selection of the most appropriate classes (stage 3) is based on a global search through the candidates, in such a way that the final classes are mutually disjoint (not related by hyperonymy). 2.2 Evaluation Ribas (1994a) reported experimental results obtained from the application of the above technique to learn SRs. He performed an evaluation of the Sits obtained from a training set of 870,000 words of the Wall Street Journal. In this section we summarize the results and conclusions reached in that paper. For instance, table 1 shows the SRs acquired for the subject position of the verb seek. Type indicates a manual diagnosis about the class appropriateness (Ok: correct; itAbs: over-generalization; Senses: due to erroneous senses). Assoc corresponds to the association score (higher values appear first). Most</context>

Nevertheless, their results should be equivalent (for our purposes) to those introducing normalization because it shouldn&apos;t affect the relative ordering of Assoc among rival candidate classes for the same (v, s). 113 suii_of _clothes&gt;, &lt; suit&gt;) , but the Assoc score ranked them higher than the appropriate sense. We can also notice that the frAbs class, &lt;group&gt;, seems too general for the example nouns, while one of its daughters, &lt; people &gt; seems to fit the data much better. Analyzing the results obtained from different experimental evaluation methods, Ribas (1994a) drew up some conclusions: a. The technique achieves a good coverage. b. Most of the classes acquired result from the accumulation of incorrect senses. c. No clear co-relation between Assoc and the manual diagnosis is found. d. A slight tendency to over-generalization exists due to incorrect senses. Although the performance of the presented technique seems to be quite good, we think that some of the detected flaws could possibly be addressed. Noise due to polysemy of the nouns involved seems to be the main obstacle for the practicality of the technique. It makes the association score prefer </context>

Local weight could be obtained using p(cln). Nevertheless, a good estimation of this probability seems quite problematic because of the lack of tagged training material. In absence of a better estimator we use a rather poor one as the uniform distribution, isenses(n) E cl w(n, c) = Isenses(n) Resnik (1993) also uses a local normalization technique but he normalizes by the total number of classes in the hierarchy. This scheme seems to present two problematic features (see (Ribas, 1994b) for more details). First, it doesn&apos;t take dependency relationships introduced by hyperonymy into account. Second, nouns categorized in lower levels in the taxonomy provide less weight to each class than higher nouns. 3.3 Other statistical measures to score SRs In this section we propose the application of other measures apart from Assoc for learning SRs: loglikelihood ratio (Dunning, 1993), relative entropy (Cover and Thomas, 1991), mutual information ratio (Church and Hanks, 1990), 02 (Gale and Church, 1991). In section (4) their experimental evaluation is presented. The statistical measur</context>

Relative entropy, D(P(Xlv_s)11P(X)), could do this job. 4 Evaluation 4.1 Evaluation methods of SRs Evaluation on NLP has been crucial to fostering research in particular areas. Evaluation of the SR learning task would provide grounds to compare different techniques that try to abstract SRs from corpus using WordNet (e.g, section 4.2). It would also permit measuring the utility of the SRs obtained using WordNet in comparison with other frameworks using other kinds of knowledge. Finally it would be a powerful tool for detecting flaws of a particular technique (e.g, (Ribas, 1994a) analysis). However, a related and crucial issue is which linguistic tasks are used as a reference. SRs are useful for both lexicography and NLP. On the one hand, from the point of view of lexicography, the goal of evaluation would be to measure the quality of the SRs induced, (i.e., how well the resulting classes correspond to the nouns as they were used in the corpus). On the other hand, from the point of view of NLP, SRs should be evaluated on their utility (i.e., how much they help on performing the reference task). 4.1.1 Lexicography-oriented evaluation As far as lexicography (quality) </context>

SRs can be seen as semantic type constraints that a word sense imposes on the words with which it combines in the process of semantic interpretation. SRs may have different applications in NLP, specifically, they may help a parser with Word Sense Selection (WSS, as in (Hirst, 1987)), with preferring certain structures out of several grammatical ones (Whittemore et al., 1990) and finally with deciding the semantic role played by a syntactic complement (Basili et al., 1992). Lexicography is also interested in the acquisition of SRs (both defining in context approach and lexical semantics work (Levin, 1992)).
