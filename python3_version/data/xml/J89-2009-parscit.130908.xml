expression or syntactic rule in one there is a corre-
sponding expression or syntactic rule in the other with
the same meaning. Rosetta differs from the strict Mon-
tague model in making no use of intensional logic or of
categorial grammar, but it adheres to the composition-
ality principle (in relating syntactic rules and semantic
structures). The paper includes many formal proofs and
only trivial sentence examples—which might well not
impress those skeptical of the value of a project whose
influence on MT theorists has been considerable in
recent years. It is followed by a description of another
experimental system (albeit less radically innovative in
linguistic conception), an account by Margaret King and
Sergei Perschke of the Eurotra project of the European
Communities. After outlining the historical background
(the need for a decentralized multilingual project capa-
ble of stimulating MT and computational linguistic
research in each of the participating countries), the
basic features are described: a linguistics-based transfer
model, modular and robust, no interactive facilities,
multilevel tree-structure interfaces, a controlled pro-
duction system operating on series of well-defined
grammars, etc. Eurotra is admitted to be relatively
traditional in its linguistics, but it is claimed to be more
advanced in its computational design and to have been
successful in promoting the study of languages not
previously the subject of MT or detailed linguistic
research.
This book represents a primary source of information
for some of the most significant and influential MT
projects in the last decade. It is greatly enhanced by a
substantial bibliography, which includes not only all
references by the contributors, but also many other
items covering the historical development of MT, the
current (1984) state of research, and related topics in
computational linguistics and artificial intelligence. The
publication delay has not diminished the value of the
contributions: many papers provide the most detailed
and comprehensive accounts of individual MT systems.
Only in the cases of Rosetta, GETA, and Eurotra can it
be said that there have been substantial changes in the
years since the Lugano tutorial. There are some omis-
sions in the historical surveys as already noted, and
readers should also be made aware that a number of
systems current at the time are not mentioned at all,
e.g., the DLT system in Utrecht, the PAHO system in
Washington, many of the largely AI-inspired projects in
the United States, the systems in the Soviet Union, and
the activity in Japan (e.g., the influential Kyoto
research). These are minor points. This is a publication
that will remain for many years an invaluable source on
MT research and it deserves to find a place on the
shelves of anyone seriously interested in computational
linguistics and in machine translation.

Advances in Natural Language Generation is the pro-
ceedings of the European Workshop on Natural Lan-
guage Generation held in January 1988 at the Abbey de
Royaumont, France. As such, it gives a fairly broad
snapshot of the work in this area going on in Europe
(with a few notable omissions, such as Wahlster, Rei-
thinger, and Danlos). The introduction by editors Zock
and Sabah, and the foreword by David McDonald
emphasize the youth of natural language generation
(NLG) as a field and the importance of workshops such
as this one in bringing together researchers from diverse
areas, such as psychology, linguistics, and artificial
intelligence, to contribute to this growing field.
Perhaps due to the youth of the field or perhaps due
to a lack of rigor on the part of the workshop organizers
and editors, the book lacks unity. The papers them-
selves vary a great deal in quality and in audience, some
presenting an introduction to some aspect of the field
and others assuming the reader knows the particular
details of a linguistic framework. Some address them-
selves directly to the problems of NLG, while others
report on just their own work and leave the connections
to NLG to the reader.
The first paper in the book, &amp;quot;Language Generation
and Explanation&amp;quot; by McKeown and Swartout, is aimed
at a wide audience and presents issues and approaches
rather than particular advances in the field. It is not a
paper from the workshop itself, but rather a reprint from
the Annual Review of Computer Science, and as such is
a very good general overview of previous work, partic-
ularly in text planning and explanation. Unfortunately,
it does not provide adequate background for the papers
in this collection; in particular, it does not supply any
introduction to the different kinds of grammars in use,
such as LFG, SFG, and FUG.
As the title of the book suggests, many of the papers
are reports on work that has in some way furthered the
state of the art in NLG. These papers are aimed at those
who already know the field, at least to some degree, and
who know some of the background behind the problems
being addressed. The best of the papers were those that

tackled theoretically interesting problems, defined them
narrowly enough to be covered adequately in a short
paper, grounded their work in implemented systems
performing a specified generation task, and provided
comparisons with other work in the field. Unfortu-
nately, few of the papers fit these qualifications. Three
in particular stood out: Novak&apos;s &amp;quot;Generating Referring
Expressions in a Dynamic Environment&amp;quot;, Mellish&apos;s
&amp;quot;Natural Language Generation from Plans&amp;quot;, and
Houghton and Pearson&apos;s &amp;quot;The Production of Spoken
Dialogue&amp;quot;.
Novak&apos;s paper addresses the problem of selecting the
information required to uniquely identify an entity in the
world and expressing it cohesively in a descriptive
paragraph. The structure of his domain, the description
of objects moving in a street scene, allows interesting
aspects of these problems to be worked on. For exam-
ple, descriptions of entities can include the events they
have participated in as well as their attributes.
Mellish also works within a particular domain (plan-
ning) and a particular generation task (producing in-
structions to carry out those plans). His work focuses
on defining an architecture for generation that uses
intermediate levels of representation between the stages
of processing. In this work he posits a process before
generation begins, called &amp;quot;optimization&amp;quot;, which reor-
ganizes the random structures of the application pro-
gram into something usable by the generator. His use of
predefined &amp;quot;algebraic simplifications&amp;quot; to optimize in-
termediate levels of representation rather than search-
ing through all possible solutions to find an optimal one
makes the task tractable.
Houghton and Pearson address the problems of pro-
ducing spoken language. They work within the context
of simulated robots cooperating to complete a task,
which provides motivations for situations and dialogs in
which to study the subtle distinctions expressed by
intonation.
The papers in the book are divided into four catego-
ries: Linguistic Approaches, Implementation Issues,
Psychological Issues, and Educational Applications.
Nearly half of the papers are in the Implementation
Issues section. They range from complete implementa-
tions, such as Roesner&apos;s detailed discussion of the four
application areas that the SEMSYN project has gener-
ated text for, to Kwee&apos;s anecdotes about extending a
functional unification grammar, complete with all the
incorrect paths he took by not adequately analyzing the
phenomena before implementing.
Many of the papers in this section went beyond
implementation issues to more theoretical issues, such
as Novak, Mellish, and Houghton and Pearson, to the
point where the section would have benefited from
being subdivided along those lines. Other papers didn&apos;t
address implementation at all, but focused on an ap-
proach to specific problems in NLG. In particular, Dale
looks at how the structure of discourse affects choosing
an appropriate referring expression, critiquing the work
of Grosz and Sidner.
The section on psycholinguistic issues exemplifies a
major contribution of this kind of workshop in bringing
together psycholinguists with Al researchers. Two pa-
pers are particularly noteworthy. Harley, who is known
for work in speech errors, presents a two-phase model
of language generation: &apos;automatic&apos; and &apos;executive&apos;
processing. Schriefers and Pechmann report on a study
of incremental text production and its effect on referen-
tial noun phrases. The only flaw of these two papers is
that they are too short. One is left wanting greater detail
about both the studies themselves and their significance
for the generation process overall.
The most disappointing section was that on linguistic
approaches. Many of these papers neither further the
field nor give the reader an overview of a particular
area. They focus on the competence of a grammar with
no consideration of how to choose between various
forms. As Zock and Sabah begin the introduction to the
book, &amp;quot;text production is decision making under spe-
cific . . . constraints&amp;quot;. Papers such as Block&apos;s (&amp;quot;Can a
&apos;Parsing Grammar&apos; be used for Natural Language Gen-
eration? The Negative Example of LFG&amp;quot;), Horacek&apos;s
(&amp;quot;The Application of Unification for Syntactic Genera-
tion in German&amp;quot;), Bunt&apos;s (&amp;quot;A Phrase Structure with
Discontinuous Grammar&amp;quot;), and Parisi and Giorgi&apos;s (&amp;quot;A
Lexically Distributed Work Ordering Component&amp;quot;) all
focus on formalisms for competence grammars without
considering how effective they are for the major process
in generation: decision making. Furthermore, they are
rather narrow in scope, not recognizing the work of
others or telling the reader how their work fits into the
larger picture. Of the grammar papers, Fawcett&apos;s &amp;quot;Lan-
guage Generation as Choice in Social Interaction&amp;quot;
addresses the problems of NLG most directly. He
presents a high level comparison between systemic
functional linguistics and what he calls &amp;quot;neo-Chom-
skyan&amp;quot; approaches, pointing out the need to consider
all aspects of language and its relation to knowledge,
rather than concentrating on structure alone.
Also in this section, Dik (&amp;quot;Concerning the Logical
Component of a Natural Language Generator&amp;quot;) ad-
dresses the problem of choice more directly and goes
beyond discussing merely syntax. In fact, he includes in
the generator work that most generation researchers
would assign to the application program, for example,
inferring the answer to a question from other informa-
tion in the knowledge base. He also makes the assump-
tion that a single representation throughout all the
generation process (i.e., linguistic realization, knowl-
edge representation, and the logical component that
does the inferencing) &amp;quot;would, in fact, be ideal&amp;quot;, without
addressing the fact that other researchers have argued
for more heterogeneous architectures (e.g., Mellish in
the same volume, and McDonald, Meteer, and Puste-
jovsky 1987).
The final section is two papers on how generators can
Computational Linguistics, Volume 15, Number 2, June 1989 121
Book Reviews Natural Language Parsing Systems
be used in educational applications. Bakker, van der
Korst, and van Schaaik put a new twist on using a
generator to implement and test a linguistic theory: they
propose using such a program to teach a particular
theory (in this case lexical functional grammar) in a
computational linguistics course.
An odd fact about the book is that it is published in
two volumes, each relatively short (under 200 pages).
The topics are split between the volumes, with half the
papers from each category in each book. I could find no
particular motivation for finding a paper in one volume
or the other. The foreword, introduction, and contents
are repeated in both books, and each has an index,
which unfortunately is split between the volumes, so
you need to look up topics twice to find all the papers
that address them. Overall, the division into volumes is
more annoying than useful (I inevitably found myself on
the right page of the wrong volume when looking for a
particular paper), and since there is no organization to
the division, it is unlikely that someone would be
interested in one volume and not the other.
Despite these complaints with the presentation and
some of the papers, the book is useful for researchers in
NLG and related fields to see the range of work going
on in Europe. While the papers themselves are short,
their bibliographies can lead the interested reader to a
wealth of related material. Furthermore, workshops
such as the one motivating this book are important and
their results need to be published. In a young field such
as NLG the focus of the workshops needs to be broad
so that it can define what the major issues are. Collec-
tions such as this one and Kempen (1987) help other
researchers see how their work interacts with the field
as a whole. As the field matures, however, these
workshops need to become more focused. As in the
AAAI-88 workshop (Hovy, McDonald, and Young
1988), the organizers and the editors need to formulate
questions and encourage researchers to address them
directly. This will provide more unity in the resulting
collections, allowing a reader to get a complete picture
of issues rather than isolated snapshots of individuals&apos;
work.

This volume, containing nine systematic studies on
several of the most advanced parsers, fulfills very well
the editor&apos;s aim characterized in his short preface,
namely to present detailed accounts of research by
outstanding specialists. The need for a complex over-
view of the present state of research in the field is
mentioned here as a point for subsequent work.
J.G. Carbonell and P.J. Hayes point out in their
contribution (pp. 1-32) how a multi-strategy approach
(dynamically changing the procedures according to
kinds of constructions being parsed) together with fail-
soft heuristics and with user interaction can be used for
an efficient treatment of semantic and structural ambi-
guity. Two implemented experimental parsers integrat-
ing several parsing strategies are characterized: CAS-
PAR, combining a case-oriented strategy (based on
domain semantics) with linear pattern matching, and
thus obtaining the flexibility and robustness needed to
handle several kinds of deviations from grammaticality;
and DYPAR, including a context-free grammar (with
domain information grouped into hierarchical semantic
categories), a pattern matching component, and a map-
ping into a canonical form (accounting for semantic
equivalence). Furthermore, an integration of the strat-
egies involved is discussed, yielding a multi-strategy
algorithm that uses top-down case-frame expectations
to constrain bottom-up pattern matching. ATNs with
logical variables and unification are compared with
definite clause grammars and used as the basic ingredi-
ents of the system described by T.W. Finin and M.
Stone Palmer (pp. 33-48). A similarity between the
applied framework and certain aspects of lexical func-
tional grammar are pointed out.
The third contribution, by J.G. Neal and S.C. Sha-
piro (pp. 49-92), stresses the role of natural language
understanding, pointing out that natural language serves
as its own metalanguage. A system understanding sen-
tences about the use of language is described, which
includes a kernel language (expressing the knowledge
necessary for a poor language user to be able to be
