The paper examines some of the cha-
racteristic features of natural langua-
ge interaction with a database system
and its implications for the processing
of singular definite descriptions. Some
proposals are made for assessing the
uniqueness claim of the singular defini-
te article in the context of retrieval
from a relational database. Other stan-
dard assumptions such as the extensio-
nal evaluation and referent evaluation
exclusively in the database - rather
than within the discourse model - are
critically examined.

A comprehensive treatment of the phe-
nomenon of singular definite description
in natural language processing constitu-
tes a research program par excellence in
the field of cognitive science. Not only
does it involve the various cognitive
disciplines but also the integration of
the traditional levels of analysis, na-
mely the syntactic, semantic and pragma-
tic levels as well as including a &amp;quot;per-
formance&amp;quot; or processing level dealing
with mechanisms for memory managment of
referring expressions. Linguistic theo-
ries initially attempted to account for
the syntactic conditions of well-formed-
nese governing the introduction of sin-
gular definite nounphrases in sentences
by postulating co-referentiality with a
previously occurring indefinite noun-
phrase having the same referential in-
dex. But it became clear that the postu-
lated requirements of co-referentiality
could only be adequately stated by means
of an extended notion of &amp;quot;discourse re-
ferent&amp;quot; (see Karttunen 1968 b).
Logicians and philosophers of language
since Russell have studied problems of
reference and of the logical form of re-
ferring expressions occurring in various
contexts (for a selection, see Linsky
1971). But it was pointed out in Donnel-
lan 1966 that a strictly truthfunctional
analysis of singular definite expres-
sions may in certain situations evaluate
to a referent which was not intended by
the speaker. Accounting for the inten-
tions of the speaker introduces the prag-
matic point of view of referring as a
speech act (see Searle 1966). How the
speaker proceeds in describing an object
s/he has in mind so that it may be cor-
rectly identified by the hearer and how
the hearer perceives the intentions of
the speaker to accordingly process des-
criptions has been the object of psycho-
logically oriented research in the area
of definite reference (e.g. Clark/Mar-
shall 1981 and Ortony-Anderson 1977). In
Artificial Intelligence, research on de-
finite descriptions has mainly proposed
computational models to resolve anapho-
ric reference by postulating certain in-
ference mechanisms (e.g. Charmiak 1972
and Rieger 1974) or mechanisms for detec-
ting and managing dialogue focus (e.g.
Grosz 1981 and Sidner 1979).
Considering practical applications in
the computer processing of natural lan-
guage it may be said that next to none
of this large body of research has been
incorporated. Most natural language
front-ends to a standard database system
support none or very primitive reference
resolution and treat the singular defini-
te article as an existential Quantifier.
This state of affairs has frequently been
motivated by the objection that most of
the aforementioned research is not yet
able to meet the challenge of a computa-
tionally efficient solution. It is hoped
that such objections, though justified,
(see for example Berwick 1983) will dimi-
nish in the course of time. More telling
are objections relating to the nature of
the natural language interaction with a
database system which is alleged to con-
stitute a restricted discourse environ-
ment not displaying the mors sophistica-
ted features of natural dialogue. The
present paper critically examines some
characteristics of such interactions with
respect to the processing of definite
descriptions and investigates to what ex-
tent the research findings aluded to abo-
ve ought to be incorporated. The paper is
intended to give an overview of the pro-

blem domain rather than to offer concre-
te solutions ; in fact its aim is to
point out areas where fruitful research
is still outstanding.

REFERRING TO DATABASE OBJECTS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999672425925926">
In a relational database an indivi-
dual entity is defined by a unique tup-
le of attributes. The uniqueness of in-
dividuals is guaranteed in the database
scheme by declaring which attributes
constitute the &amp;quot;key&amp;quot; of the relation.
The key attributes as it were constitu-
te the &amp;quot;essential&amp;quot; properties of an in-
dividual whereas its nom-key attributes
constitute its &amp;quot;accidental&amp;quot; properties.
(The term &amp;quot;individual&amp;quot; is used in a
broad sense to denote abstract as well
as physical objects, events, acts, situ-
ations ...). Philosophically, such pro-
perties are said to be &amp;quot;essential&amp;quot; which
uniquely characterize an individual in
time and space - and remain constant in
all &amp;quot;possible worlds&amp;quot;. For example a hu-
man being might be essentially characte-
rized by his/her parents, date and time
of birth. In everyday discourse, on the
other hand, individuals are usually re-
ferred to by a particular description
which enables the hearer to identify the
entity and which is chosen on the basis
of assumptions about shared knowledge
between the discourse participants. (See
Clark/Marshall 1981 for a more detailed
account of these assumptions).
When interacting with a database
querying system a user may well be awa-
re of the fact that s/he does not share
any previous experience with the system
and that it is hence appropriate to
characterize objects by their defining
properties in the real world, ie a sam-
ple is defined by the factory and loca-
tion and the date and time it was taken
and not by a description such as &amp;quot;the
foul smelling sample&amp;quot;. In principle
then, the prospective user could be in-
structed to &amp;quot;use only fully specified
descriptions&amp;quot;. This is an unrealistic
expectation for two reasons. First, in
concrete database designs the key attri-
butes of a relation are not usually cho-
sen to reflect the state of affairs in
the real world but rather out of consi-
derations of processing efficiency. Se-
cond, the natural inclinition to be con-
cise when interacting in natural lan-
guage compels the user to use ellipti-
cal descriptions, as in the dialogue be-
low :
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.590506666666667">
- Where all samples taken from the
firm Miller in 1980 analysed ?
- Yes.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999053825396826">
- Did the sample taken in October
contain any cyanide ?
Few users would remember to specify &amp;quot;from
the firm Miller&amp;quot; in the follow-up query.
A system which wishes to offer a minimum
of comfort in use should be able to pro-
cess &amp;quot;elliptical&amp;quot; descriptions which can
be made unique by supplementing informa-
tion from the preceding context.
So far we have assumed that in prin-
ciple all entities a user wishes to re-
fer to can be characterised by a number
of essential properties. In reality the
user often does not know the values for
the essential attributes and hence has
to use another description to refer to
the entity ; for example, &amp;quot;the sample
from Miller that contained 250 mg of ar-
senic&amp;quot;. Such descriptions could be dis-
tinguished from the former by the fact
that they contain some non-key attribu-
tes which the user claims happen to eva-
luate to a unique entity in a particular
state of the database.
From the point of view of establis-
hing the uniqueness of singular defini-
te descriptions, one might distinguish
the following four types :
(i) intrinsically functional descrip-
tions
(ii) extrinsically functional descrip-
tions
(iii) incomplete extrinsically functio-
nal descriptions
(iv) non-functional or reference esta-
blishing descriptions
Descriptions in category (i) are fun-
ctional by virtue of the linguistic ex-
pression used. These include superlati-
ves such as the highest salary, expres-
tions denoting aggregate functions such
as the average, the sum ... and expres-
sions with nominal modifiers such as the
colour red and the number 13. Descrip-
tions in category (ii) are functional by
virtue of the state of the world (reflec-
ted in the database scheme and the inte-
grity constraints). The president of the
United States in 1985, the sample from
the firm Miller taken on 13.10.80 and
the salary of G.B. Jones are examples of
this category. Descriptions in category
(iii) are incompletely specified instan-
ces of category (ii) which can be made
functional by searching contextual in-
formation or by requesting such informa-
tion from the user. Descriptions in ca-
tegory (iv) are sometimes called &amp;quot;refe-
rence establishing&amp;quot; as the specified
properties do not guarantee the unique-
ness of the description but the speaker
maintains the description denotes uni-
quely and expects the hearer to accept
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999767275">
this assumption.
In order to process descriptions ef-
ficiently a natural language processor
should be able to recognize the type of
a description. Intrinsically functional
descriptions may be evaluated immediate-
ly in the database. For extrinsically
functional descriptions the database
scheme and the integrity constraints
could indicate whether a given descrip-
tion is fully specified. In case the
description contains some but not all
key attributes and it does not contain
any non-key attributes it would seem to
belong to category (iii) and in case it
contains any non-key attributes it would
appear to belong to category (iv). For
cases of incomplete functional descrip-
tions complementation procedures should
be invoked, whereas the non-functional
descriptions must be evaluated and an
error message should be sent in case the
description does not denote uniquely.
Obviously, the proposals are only very
tentative and require more thorough re-
search. However, the bring us to consi-
der the question of checking the unique-
ness claim implicit in the use of singu-
lar the.
A natural language query to a rela-
tional database is usually translated
into a query language based on the rela-
tional calculus and the singular defini-
te article is represented by the exis-
tential quantifier. For example, the
query
- Who is the president of the U.S.
married to 7
might be presentedin a query language
based on the domain relational calculus
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.964779">
83
lc /3 x PRES (PERSON x, COUNTRY .
&apos;USA&apos;)/\
MARRIED-TO (PERSON x, PER-
SON =
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999314036144578">
For a system to ignore the uniqueness
claim of the singular definite article
is at best uncooperative and at worst
may lead to semantically incorrect re-
presentations. Thus, the distinction be-
tween restrictive and non-restrictive
modifiers is ignored. (Of course the re-
presentation of non-restrictive modifiers
introduces the additional problems of
how to process surplus information).
The following major proposals for the
logical form of the singular definite
article have been made : contextual eli-
mination, a description operator and a
special quantifier, Russell&apos;s proposal,
namely Q(the x Px)-03x Px A (V y
X) A Qx contextually eliminates the des-
cription, i.e. a description has no re-
ference out of context. Russell&apos;s inclu-
sion of the uniquenees postulate as a
truth condition for the proposition im-
plies that the sentence is false when
the uniqueness claim fails. If the is
treated as a description operatEli-crea-
ting a singular term, the description
may receive a denotation out of context.
When the description has no referent,
the proposition contains an undefined
argument and on some interpretations
lacks truth value. The treatment of the
as a quantifier which takes a pair of
predicates to form a sentence was advo-
cated in Moore 1981 because it allows
indication of scope differences. In the
context of query evaluation it would
seem more user-cooperative to treat pro-
positions containing descriptions which
do not evaluate to a unique referent as
lacking truth value ; thus, the unique-
ness claim might be viewed as a &amp;quot;seman-
tic presuppostion&amp;quot;. Under the assumption
that it is desirable for reasons of com-
municative adequacy to represent the
relational claim in queries, it should
be investigated how query languages ba-
sed on the relational calculus could be
augmented by a special quantifier or
operator, given that the contextual eli-
mination approach would create an exces-
sive processing overhead.
ON THE PRAGMATICS OF REFERRING EXPRES-
SIONS
In natural discourse situations a
speaker choses a description which will
enable the listener to identify the spe-
aker has in mind. In some contexts, ho-
wever, &apos;identification&amp;quot; is not to be in-
terpreted in terms of the hearer retrie-
ving some memory entity having the pro-
perties of the description. For example,
a hearer may have been told : &amp;quot;the pre-
sident of Zaire will be visiting France
next week&amp;quot;. Storing this proposition
does not require finding a referent for
the description the president of Zaire
- although s/he may do so depending on
the hearer&apos;s world knowledge. It would
appear that when processing statements
containing descriptions, the hearer has
the choice of either resolving the re-
ferent or storing the description. (This
is not the case in all contexts. For ex-
ample, the statement &amp;quot;the woman who bro-
ke her leg is recovering&amp;quot; assumes pre-
vious knowledge of the referent, where-
as the description the president of Za-
ire presumably only presuposes the pre-
vious knowledge that Zaire is a country
and that countries may be governed by
a president. (This aspect of the prag-
matics of definite descriptions would be
an interesting research topic, which to
our knowledge has not been investigated)
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.997681">
215
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998472">
However, the speaker does not always
leave the interpretation strategy up to
the hearer but sometimes requires the
hearer to identify the specific indivi-
dual s/he has in mind, whereas in other
contexts it may be the speaker&apos;s inten-
tion not to denote a specific indivi-
dual but rather that the description be
applied to the semantic referent. This
is roughly the distinction made by &amp;quot;Do-
nnellan between the &amp;quot;referential&amp;quot; and
the &amp;quot;attributive&amp;quot; uses of the singular
definite article.
Do the above observations about des-
criptions in statements equally apply
to questions and is the referential/at-
tributive distinction relevant in the
context of database querying ? To ans-
wer this question comprehensively in-
volves in the last resort epistimologi-
cal considerations.
The question Will the nresident of Zaire
be visiting France might be answered
positively by someone who happened to
have read this news in the paper. Truth
-functionally, however, the question
can only receive a positive answer in
case the corresponding statement repre-
sents a true proposition, after the
description has received an extensional
evaluation, ie colonel Mobutu. The ex-
tensional approach to semantic evalu-
ation is the one adopted in database
querying. This strategy would seem ap-
propriate in most cases. Suppose, how-
ever, the user asks the query &amp;quot;Can the
president of the U.S. veto the Senate?&amp;quot;.
This description is not intended refe-
rentially (ie about Ronald Reagan in
19e5) but attributively. It might be
objected that the description in this
context rather denotes a generic con-
cept and that conventional database
systems are not set up to answer such
queries. Nevertheless, when a descrip-
tion has been extensionally evaluated
the description itself should be retai-
ned for the subsequent resolution of
anaphoric expressions. For example, in
the following dialogue :
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.781536">
- Did the president of the U.S.
visit France in 1982 ?
- No.
- Did he visit Germany in 1979 ?
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.991203268656717">
Substitution of &amp;quot;Ronald Reagan&amp;quot; in the
second query would result in a wrong
answer. (Different interpretation mo-
des for anaphoric descriptions have
been investigated more thoroughly in
Grosz et. al. 1983).
DISCOURSE REFERENTS IN DATABASE QUERIES
In the preceding section it was seen
that a truth-functional evaluation of
queries presupposes an extensional eva-
luation of descriptions in the database.
In natural discourse situations the re-
ferent of a description may be another
description which appeared previously in
the discourse, rather than an entity in
the real world. This previously mentio-
ned entity may be called a &amp;quot;discourse
referent&amp;quot; a term introduced by Karttun-
en to explain certain phenomena of re-
ferential indexing for definite descrip-
tions. According to Karttunen 68-a a
discourse referent is &amp;quot;an entity that -
once it has been established - can be
referred to by a pronoun or revived by
a definite description&amp;quot; and is not to be
equated with either &amp;quot;the individual the
speaker has in mind&amp;quot; nor with &amp;quot;the thing
in the real world&amp;quot;. For example, the
assertion
(Si) Jones took a sample from the
firm Miller
establishes a discourse entity which
may be revived by &amp;quot;the sample that Jo-
nes took from the firm Miller&amp;quot;. Discour-
se referents in the strict sense are
introduced in the discourse by means of
an indefinite description. (The notion
has been extended in Karttunen 68 b).
Adopting the logical formalism for des-
cribing discourse referents proposed in
Webber 1978 this discourse referent
could be described as :
: SAMPLE (x)A TOOK (Jones,x)
AORIGIN (x, Miller)AEVOKE
(x, Si)
A proposition mentioning the sentence
where the indefinite description was
introduced establishes the contextual
uniqueness of the singular definite des-
cription.
How does the notion of &amp;quot;discourse
referent&amp;quot; as explained above operate in
questions ? For example, does the query
(S2) Did Jones take a sample from
the firm Miller ?
establish a discourse referent ? Ob-
viously, the description &amp;quot;the sample
Jones took from the firm Miller&amp;quot; can
only be used subsequently if the ans-
wer to (S2) is positive. It might be
posited hence that the reply
(S3) Yes
implies the statement &amp;quot;Jones took a
sample from the firm Miller&amp;quot; and that
hance the description of the discourse
referent would contain the proposition
EVOKE (x, S3).
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.99603">

<bodyText confidence="0.991046581395349">
A system which behaves like a natu-
ral discourse partner should store the
description of the discourse referent
(together with a pointer to its referen-
tial index which was retrieved on ans-
wering S2). If the user should in the
subsequent discourse - no matter how
many sentences intervene - refer to
&amp;quot;the sample Jones took from Miller&amp;quot; the
system should not reject this descrip-
tion as being incompletely specified.
If the answer to (S2) had been ne-
gative, no discourse referent would
have been established. Can one infer
from this example the general rule
that negatively answered questions can-
not establish a discourse referent ?
Consider the following interaction :
(54) Did the graduate admissions
committee hold a meeting today?
(S5) No.
(56) Was the meeting postponed ?
Can the expression &amp;quot;the meeting&amp;quot; in (86)
be construed as an abbreviation for
&amp;quot;the meeting of the graduate admissions
committee which was not held yesterday&amp;quot;
or is it simply an abbreviation for
&amp;quot;the meeting of the graduate admissions
committee&amp;quot; ? The difference between
(S2) and (54) can perhaps be accounted
for by the difference between the non-
-specific use of the indefinite article
in (S2) and the specific use in (S4).
In the specific use the relative clause
derived from the predicate in the ori-
ginal question, ie that was held vester-
la, should be understood in a non-re-
strictive sense and is hence not an es-
sential part in the description of the
discourse referent. Further research
into the behaviour of indefinites in
negative and interrogative contexts is
is again called for.

Russell&apos;s inclusion of the uniquenees postulate as a truth condition for the proposition implies that the sentence is false when the uniqueness claim fails. If the is treated as a description operatEli-creating a singular term, the description may receive a denotation out of context. When the description has no referent, the proposition contains an undefined argument and on some interpretations lacks truth value. The treatment of the as a quantifier which takes a pair of predicates to form a sentence was advocated in Moore 1981 because it allows indication of scope differences. In the context of query evaluation it would seem more user-cooperative to treat propositions containing descriptions which do not evaluate to a unique referent as lacking truth value ; thus, the uniqueness claim might be viewed as a &amp;quot;semantic presuppostion&amp;quot;. Under the assumption that it is desirable for reasons of communicative adequacy to represent the relational claim in queries, it should be investigated how query languages based on the relational calculus could be augmented by a special quantifier or operator, given that the contextual el</context>

For example, the assertion (Si) Jones took a sample from the firm Miller establishes a discourse entity which may be revived by &amp;quot;the sample that Jones took from the firm Miller&amp;quot;. Discourse referents in the strict sense are introduced in the discourse by means of an indefinite description. (The notion has been extended in Karttunen 68 b). Adopting the logical formalism for describing discourse referents proposed in Webber 1978 this discourse referent could be described as : : SAMPLE (x)A TOOK (Jones,x) AORIGIN (x, Miller)AEVOKE (x, Si) A proposition mentioning the sentence where the indefinite description was introduced establishes the contextual uniqueness of the singular definite description. How does the notion of &amp;quot;discourse referent&amp;quot; as explained above operate in questions ? For example, does the query (S2) Did Jones take a sample from the firm Miller ? establish a discourse referent ? Obviously, the description &amp;quot;the sample Jones took from the firm Miller&amp;quot; can only be used subsequently if the answer to (S2) is </context>
