Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999683">
Most existing anaphora resolution algo-
rithms are designed to account only for
anaphors with NP-antecedents. This paper
describes an algorithm for the resolution of
discourse deictic anaphors, which constitute
a large percentage of anaphors in spoken di-
alogues. The success of the resolution is
dependent on the classification of all pro-
nouns and demonstratives into individual,
discourse deictic and vague anaphora. Fi-
nally, the empirical results of the application
of the algorithm to a corpus of spoken dia-
logues are presented.

<bodyText confidence="0.965534911764706">
Most anaphora resolution algorithms are designed to
deal with the co-indexing relation between anaphors
and NP-antecedents. In the spoken language corpus
we examined — the Switchboard corpus of telephone
conversations (LDC, 1993) — this type of link only
accounts for 45.1% of all anaphoric references. An-
other 22.6% are anaphors whose referents are not in-
dividual, concrete entities but events, facts and propo-
sitions, e.g.,
(1) B.7: [We never know what they&apos;re thinking].
A.8: That&apos;s right. [I don&apos;t trust them]3,
maybe I guess iti &apos;s because of what
happened over there with their own
people, how they threw them out of
power. (sw3241)
Whilst there have been attempts to classify abstract
objects and the rules governing anaphoric reference to
them (Webber, 1991; Asher, 1993; Dahl and Hellman,
1995), there have been no exhaustive, empirical stud-
ies using actual resolution algorithms. These have so
far only been applied to written corpora. However,
the high frequency of abstract object anaphora in dia-
logues means that any attempt to resolve anaphors in
spoken language cannot succeed without taking this
into account.
Summarised below are some issues specific to
anaphora resolution in spoken dialogues (see also
Byron and Stent (1998) who mention some of these
problems in their account of the Centering model
(Grosz et al., 1995)).
Center of attention in multi-party discourse. In
spontaneous speech it is possible that the participants
of a dialogue may not be focussing on the same entity
at a given point in the discourse.

Utterances with no discourse entities. E.g., Uh-

huh; yeah; right. Byron and Stent (1998) and
Walker (1998) assign no importance to such utterances
in their models. We assume that these also can be used
to acknowledge a preceding utterance.
Abandoned or partial utterances. Speakers may in-
terrupt each other or make speech repairs, e.g.,
(2) Uh, our son, has this kind of, you know, he &apos;s,
well he, started out going Stephen F Austin
(sw3117)
Self-corrected speech cannot be ignored as can be
seen by the fact that the entity referred to by the NP
our son is subsequently referred to by a pronoun and
must therefore have entered the discourse model.
Determination of utterance boundaries. Most
anaphor resolution algorithms rely on a syntactic def-
inition of utterance which cannot be provided by spo-
ken dialogue as there is no punctuation to mark com-
plete sentences.
These issues are dealt with by our method of segment-
ing dialogues into dialogue acts with specified dis-
course functions. In addition, our approach presents
a simple classification of individual and abstract ob-
ject anaphors and uses separate algorithms for each
class. We build on the recall rate of state-of-the-art
pronoun resolution algorithms but we achieve a far
higher precision than would be achieved by applying
these to spoken language because the classification of

anaphors prevents the algorithm from co-indexing dis-
course deictic anaphora with individual antecedents.
Section 2 gives definitions and frequency of occur-
rence of the different anaphor types. Section 3 de-
scribes the segmentation of the dialogues into dialogue
acts and the influence of these on the entities in the
discourse model. Section 4 presents the method we
use for resolving anaphors and the corresponding al-
gorithm. In Section 5, we report on the corpus anno-
tation and the evaluation of the algorithm.

2 Anaphor Types in Dialogues
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.820154529411765">
In the dialogues examined, only 45.1% of the anaphors
are individual anaphors, i.e., anaphors with NP-
antecedents (IPro, IDem), e.g.,
(3) Boeing ought to hire himi and give himi a
junkyardi, ... and see if hei could build a
Seven Forty-Seven out of itj. (sw2102)
22.6% of the anaphors are discourse deictic, i.e.
co-specify with non-NP constituents such as VPs, sen-
tences, strings of sentences (DDPro, DDDem; cf.
Webber (1991)). The phenomenon of discourse de-
ictic anaphora in written texts has been shown to be
strongly dependent on discourse structure. As can also
be seen in the examples below, anaphoric reference is
restricted to elements adjacent to the utterance con-
taining the anaphor, i.e., those on the right frontier
of the discourse structure tree (Webber, 1991; Asher,
1993):

her],? No, she didn&apos;t do thati.
(sw4877)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.994539607142857">
The existence of abstract object anaphora shows
that aside from individual entities, the discourse model
may also contain complex, higher-order entities. One
of the differences between individual and discourse
deictic anaphora is that whereas a concrete NP an-
tecedent usually only refers to the individual it de-
scribes, a sentence may simultaneously denote an
eventuality, a concept, a proposition and a fact.
Instead of assuming that all levels of abstract ob-
jects are introduced to the discourse model by the sen-
tence that makes them available, it has been suggested
that anaphoric discourse deictic reference involves ref-
erent coercion (Webber, 1991; Asher, 1993; Dahl and
Hellman, 1995). This assumption is further justified
by the fact that discourse deictic reference, as opposed
to individual anaphoric reference, is often established
by demonstratives rather than pronouns. In theories
relating cognitive status and choice of NP-form (cf.
Gundel et al. (1993)), pronouns are only available for
the most salient entities, whereas demonstratives can
be used to shift the focus of attention to a different en-
tity.
A further 19.1% of anaphors are Inferrable-
Evoked Pronouns (IEPro) and constitute a particular
type of plural pronoun which indirectly co-specifies
with a singular antecedent. This group includes exis-
tential, generic and corporate 3rd person plural pro-
nouns (Jaeggli, 1986; Belletti and Rizzi, 1988).

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999740571428571">
In (6), the NP Soviet Union can be associated with
inferrables such as the population or the government.
These can subsequently be referred to by pronouns
without having been explicitly mentioned themselves.
In some cases of IEPro&apos;s there is no associated NP, as
in the following example, where the speaker is refer-
ring to the organisers of the Switchboard calls:

realize that they ha-, were going to reach
out to people from [...] all over the country.
(sw2041)
13.2% of the anaphors are vague (VagPro, Vag-
Dem), in the sense that they refer to the general topic
of conversation and, as opposed to discourse deic-
tic anaphors, do not have a specific clause as an an-
tecedent, e.g.,
(8) B.29: I mean, the baby is like seventeen
months and she just screams.
A.30: Uh-huh.
B.31: Well even if she knows that they&apos;re

A.32: Uh-huh.
B.33: — you know.
A.34: Yeah. It&apos;s hard.
Non-referring pronouns, or expletives, were not
marked. These include subjects of weather verbs,
those in raising verb constructions or those occurring
in sentences with extraposed sentential subjects or ob-
jects, e.g.,

are just so, uh, bare on the shelves as there.

expletives (Postal and Pullum, 1988), defined as being
non-referring pronouns in argument positions, e.g.,

3 Synchronising Units
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.979801555555556">
The domain which contains potential antecedents is
not given in syntactic terms in spoken dialogue. Hence
we define this domain in pragmatic terms. We assume
that discourse entities enter the joint discourse model
and are available for subsequent reference when com-
mon ground between the discourse participants is es-
tablished. Our model builds on the observation that
certain dialogue acts — in particular acknowledgments
— signal that common ground is achieved. Our as-
sumptions are based on Clark&apos;s (1989) theory of con-
tributions (cf. also Traum (1994)).
Each dialogue is divided into short, clearly de-
fined dialogue acts — Initiations I and Acknowledg-
ments A — based on the top of the hierarchy given
in Carletta et al. (1997). Each sentence and each con-
joined clause counts as a separate I, even if they are
part of the same turn. A&apos;s do not convey semantic con-
tent but have a pragmatic function (e.g., backchannel).
In addition there are utterances which function as an
A but also have semantic content — these are labelled
as All.
A single I is paired with an A and they jointly form
a Synchronising Unit (SU). In longer turns, each main
clause functions as a separate unit along with its sub-
ordinate clauses. Single I&apos;s constitute SU&apos;s by them-
selves and do not require explicit acknowledgment.
The assumption is that by letting the speaker continue,
the hearer implicitly acknowledges the utterance. It is
only in the context of turn-taking that I&apos;s and A&apos;s are
paired up.
Our model is based on the observation that com-
mon ground has an influence on attentional state. We
assume that only entities in a complete SU are en-
tered into the common ground and remain in the S-
list for the duration of a further SU. If one speaker&apos;s I
is not acknowledged by the other participant it cannot
be included in an SU. In this case the discourse enti-
ties mentioned in the unacknowledged I are added to
the S-List but are immediately deleted again when the
subsequent! clearly shows that they are not part of the
common ground.
Figure 1 below, taken from the Trains-corpus
(speakers s and u) illustrates that a missing acknowl-
edgment prevents the discourse model from contain-
ing discourse entities from the unacknowledged turn.

not the most recent orange warehouse.

4 How to Resolve Discourse Deictic
Anaphora

We now turn to our method of anaphora reso-

anaphora.

4.1 Anaphor-antecedent Compatibility

<bodyText confidence="0.999845882352941">
As indicated in Section 2, information provided by
the subcategorisation frame of the anaphor&apos;s predicate
can be used to determine the type of the referent. In
the algorithm, we make use of the notion of anaphor-
antecedent Compatibility to distinguish between dis-
course deictic and individual reference. Certain pred-
icates (notably verbs of propositional attitude) require
one of their arguments to have a referent whose mean-
ing is correlated with sentences, e.g., is true, assume
(referred to as SC-bias verbs in Garnsey et al. (1997)
and elsewhere). Pronouns in these positions rarely
have concrete individual NP-antecedents and are gen-
erally only compatible with discourse deictic refer-
ents. Other argument positions are preferentially as-
sociated with concrete individuals (e.g., objects of eat,
smell) (DO-bias verbs). A summary of these predicate
types is provided in Figure 2, where 1-incompatible

and A-incompatible means preferentially associated
with individual objects I . Anaphors which are argu-
ment positions of the first type are classified as dis-
course deictic (DDPro; DDDem), those in argument
positions of the second type are classified as individ-
ual anaphora (IPro; IDem).
It is clear that predicate information alone is not suf-
ficient for this purpose as there is a large group of
verbs which allow both individual and discourse de-
ictic referents (e.g., objects of see, know) (EQ-bias
verbs). In these cases the preference is determined by
NP-form of the anaphor (pronoun vs. demonstrative).

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998884">
4.2 Types of Abstract Antecedents
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9996046">
We follow Asher (1993) in assuming that the predicate
of a discourse deictic anaphor determines the type of
abstract object. An anaphor in the object position of
the verb do, for example, can only have a VP (event-
concept) antecedent (eg John [sang]. Bill did that
too.), whereas an anaphor in the subject position of
the predicate is true requires a full S (proposition) (eg
[John sang]. That&apos;s true.). This verbal subcategorisa-
tion information is used to determine which part of the
preceding I is required to form the correct referent.
Following Webber and others, we assume that an
abstract object is only introduced to the discourse
model by the anaphor itself. In addition to the S-List
(Strube, 1998), which contains the referents of NPs
available for anaphoric reference, our model includes

&apos;These are preferences and not strict rules because some
1-Incompatible contexts are compatible with NPs denoting
abstract objects, e.g., The story/It is true. and NPs which
are used to stand elliptically for an event or state, e.g., His
car/It is the reason why he&apos;s late. This shows that predicate
compatibility must ultimately be defined in semantic terms
and not just rely on syntactic strings (NP vs. S).

The algorithm consists of two branches, one for the
resolution of pronouns, the other for the resolution of
demonstratives. Both of them call the functions re-
solveDD and resolvelnd, which resolve discourse de-
ictic anaphora and individual anaphora, respectively.
If a pronoun is encountered (Figure 4, below), the
functions resolveDD or resolveInd (described below)
are evaluated, depending on whether the pronoun is I-
incompatible (1) or A-incompatible (2). In the case of
success the pronouns are classified as DDPro or IPro,
respectively. In the case of failure, the pronouns are
classified as VagPro. If the pronoun is neither I- nor
A-incompatible (i.e., the pronoun is ambiguous in this
respect), the classification is only dependent on the

success of the resolution. The function resolvelnd is
evaluated first (3) because of the observed preference
for individual antecedents for pronouns,. If success-
ful, the pronoun is classified as IPro, if unsuccessful,
the function resolveDD attempts to resolve the pro-
noun (4). If this, in turn, is successful, the pronoun is
classified as DDPro, if it is unsuccessful it is classi-
fied as VagPro, indicating that the pronoun cannot be
resolved using the linguistic context.
The procedure is similar in the case of demonstra-
tives (Figure 5, below). The only difference being that
the antecedent of a demonstrative is preferentially an
abstract object. The order of (3) and (4) is therefore
reversed.
We now turn to the function resolveDD (Figure 6,
below) (assuming that resolvelnd resolves individual
anaphora and returns true or false depending on its
success). In step (1) the function resolveDD examines
all elements of the context ranking (Figure 3) until the
function co-index succeeds, which evaluates whether
the element is of the right type. Then the function
resolveDD returns true. If the pronoun is an argu-
ment of &amp;quot;do&amp;quot;, the function co-index is tried on the VP
of the current element of the context ranking (2). If
successful, the VP-referent is added to the A-List and
the function returns true. In (3), co-index evaluates
whether the pronoun and the current element of the
context ranking are compatible. In the case of a posi-
tive result, the element is added to the A-List and true
is returned. If all elements of the context ranking are

A.11: and it has not been successful.
(sw2403)
When the pronoun &amp;quot;it&amp;quot; in A.9 is encountered,
the algorithm determines the pronoun to be I-
incompatible (Step 1 in Figure 4), as it is the object
argument of the verb do. The function resolveDD is
evaluated. The A-List is empty, so the highest ranked
element in the context ranking is the last complete sen-
tence in B.8. The pronoun is an argument of &amp;quot;do&amp;quot;,
therefore gets co-indexed with the VP-referent of the
sentence in B.8. The VP is added to the A-List, the
function returns true and the pronoun is classified as
DDPro by the algorithm.
When the next pronoun is encountered, the A-
List is empty again because of the intervening sen-
tence (I) in B.10. The pronoun is neither I- nor
A-incompatible, therefore the algorithm evaluates re-
solvelnd (step 3). This fails, since there are no indi-
vidual antecedents available in B.10 and the algorithm
evaluates resolveDD in the step (4). The first element
in the context ranking is the main clause in A.11 which
is co-indexed with the pronoun. The clause-referent
is added to the A-List, the function returns true and
the algorithm classifies the pronoun as DDPro. In this
case, the classification is correct but not the resolution,
since the pronoun should co-specify with the pronoun
in A.9.

<bodyText confidence="0.995500161290323">
Our data consisted of five randomly selected dia-
logues from the Switchboard corpus of spoken tele-
phone conversations (LDC, 1993). Two dialogues
(SW2041, SW4877) were used to train the two annota-
tors (the authors), and three further dialogues for test-
ing (SW2403, SW3117, SW3241). The training dia-
logues were used for improving the annotation manual
and for clarifying the annotation in borderline cases.
After each step the annotations were compared us-
ing the K statistic as reliability measure for all classifi-
cation tasks (Carletta, 1996). A K of 0.68 &lt;K &lt; 0.80
allows tentative conclusions while K &gt; 0.80 indicates
reliability between the annotators. In the following ta-
bles, the rows on above the horizontal line show how
often a particular class was actually marked as such by
both annotators. In the rows below the line, N shows
the total number of markables, while Z gives the num-
ber of agreements between the annotations. PA is per-
cent agreement between the annotators, PE expected
agreement by chance. Finally, K is computed by the
formula PA- PER- PE.
Dialogue Acts. First, turns were segmented into di-
alogue act units. We turned the segmentation task into
a classification task by using boundaries between di-
alogue acts as one class and non-boundaries as the
other (see Passonneau and Litman (1997) for a simi-
lar practice). In Table 1, Non-Bound. and Bound. give
the number of non-boundaries and boundaries actu-
ally marked by the annotators, N is the total number
of possible boundary sites, while Z gives the number
of agreements between the annotations.

vide reliability scores using 1£ because it is not a clas-
sification task. It is much more difficult than the
previous ones, as the problem consists of identifying
the correct beginning and end of the string which co-
specifies with the anaphor. We used only the abstract
anaphors whose classification both annotators agreed
upon. The annotators then marked the antecedents and
co-indexed them with the anaphors. The results were
compared and the annotators agreed upon a reconciled
version of the data. Annotator accuracy was then mea-
sured against the reconciled version. Accuracy ranged
from 85,7% (Annotator A) to 94,3% (Annotator B).

We used the reconciled version of the annotation as
key for the abstract anaphora resolution algorithm. Ta-
ble 6 shows the results of the evaluation. Precision is
63.6% and Recall 70%.
Table 6: Results of the Discourse Deictic Anaphora
Algorithm
The low value for precision indicates that the classi-
fication did not perform very well. Of the 28 anaphors
resolved incorrectly, only 11 were classified correctly.
One of the most common errors in classification was,
that an anaphor annotated as vague (VagPro, VagDem)
was classified by the algorithm as discourse deictic
(DDPro, DDDem). Classification is dependent on res-
olution, so since the context almost always provides an
antecedent for a discourse deictic anaphor, it is possi-
ble to classify and resolve a vague anaphor incorrectly,
as in Example 13:
(13) A: [I don&apos;t know] , I think it, really depends
a lot on the child.

<bodyText confidence="0.999931111111111">
Both Webber (1991) and Asher (1993) describe the
phenomenon of abstract object anaphora and present
restrictions on the set of potential antecedents. They
do not, however, concern themselves with the problem
of how to classify a certain pronoun or demonstrative
as individual or abstract. Also, as they do not give
preferences on the set of potential candidates, their
approaches are not intended as attempts to resolve ab-
stract object anaphora.
Concerning anaphora resolution in dialogues, only
little research has been carried out in this area to our
knowledge. LuperFoy (1992) does not present a cor-
pus study, meaning that statistics about the distribution
of individual and abstract object anaphora or about
the success rate of her approach are not available.
Byron and Stent (1998) present extensions of the cen-
tering model (Grosz et al., 1995) for spoken dialogue
and identify several problems with the model. We
have chosen Strube&apos;s (1998) model for the resolution
of individual anaphora as basis because it avoids the
problems encountered by Byron &amp; Stent, who also do
not present data on the resolution of pronouns in dia-
logues and do not mention abstract object anaphora.
Dagan and Itai (1991) describe a corpus-based ap-
proach to the resolution of pronouns, which is evalu-
ated for the neuter pronoun &amp;quot;it&amp;quot;. Again, abstract ob-
ject anaphora are not mentioned.

7 Conclusions and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999125875">
In this paper we presented a method for resolving ab-
stract object anaphora in spoken language. We con-
sider our approach to be a first step towards the un-
constrained resolution of anaphora in dialogue.
The results of our method show that the recall is
fairly high while the precision is relatively low. This
indicates that the anaphor classification requires im-
provement, in particular the notion of Compatibility.
Lists of verb biases for sentential and NP comple-
ments, as described in psycholinguistic studies (e.g.
Garnsey et al. (1997)), could be used to classify verbs.
Currently exisiting lists only account for a small num-
ber of verbs but there may be the possibility of adding
statistical information from large corpora of spoken
dialogue.
Furthermore, the algorithm currently ignores ab-
stract NPs (e.g., story, exercising) when looking for
antecedents for anaphors with I-incompatible predi-
cates. We are considering determining the feature ab-
stract for all NPs in order to identify those which can
act as antecedents in such contexts.
Information such as this could be used by the algo-
rithm to prevent the anaphor classification from being
dependent on anaphor resolution.

<abstract confidence="0.999005142857143">Most existing anaphora resolution algorithms are designed to account only for anaphors with NP-antecedents. This paper describes an algorithm for the resolution of discourse deictic anaphors, which constitute a large percentage of anaphors in spoken dialogues. The success of the resolution is dependent on the classification of all pronouns and demonstratives into individual, discourse deictic and vague anaphora. Finally, the empirical results of the application of the algorithm to a corpus of spoken dialogues are presented.</abstract>

Another 22.6% are anaphors whose referents are not individual, concrete entities but events, facts and propositions, e.g., (1) B.7: [We never know what they&apos;re thinking]. A.8: That&apos;s right. [I don&apos;t trust them]3, maybe I guess iti &apos;s because of what happened over there with their own people, how they threw them out of power. (sw3241) Whilst there have been attempts to classify abstract objects and the rules governing anaphoric reference to them (Webber, 1991; Asher, 1993; Dahl and Hellman, 1995), there have been no exhaustive, empirical studies using actual resolution algorithms. These have so far only been applied to written corpora. However, the high frequency of abstract object anaphora in dialogues means that any attempt to resolve anaphors in spoken language cannot succeed without taking this into account.

(sw2102) 22.6% of the anaphors are discourse deictic, i.e. co-specify with non-NP constituents such as VPs, sentences, strings of sentences (DDPro, DDDem; cf. Webber (1991)). The phenomenon of discourse deictic anaphora in written texts has been shown to be strongly dependent on discourse structure. As can also be seen in the examples below, anaphoric reference is restricted to elements adjacent to the utterance containing the anaphor, i.e., those on the right frontier of the discourse structure tree (Webber, 1991; Asher, 1993): (4) A.46: [The government don&apos;t tell you everything.] i B.47: I know iti (sw3241) (5) Now why didn&apos;t she [take him over there with her],? No, she didn&apos;t do thati. (sw4877) The existence of abstract object anaphora shows that aside from individual entities, the discourse model may also contain complex, higher-order entities. One of the differences between individual and discourse deictic anaphora is that whereas a concrete NP antecedent usually only refers to the individual it describes, a sentence may simultaneously denote an eventuality, a concept, a proposition and a fact. Instead of assum</context>

Anaphors which are argument positions of the first type are classified as discourse deictic (DDPro; DDDem), those in argument positions of the second type are classified as individual anaphora (IPro; IDem). It is clear that predicate information alone is not sufficient for this purpose as there is a large group of verbs which allow both individual and discourse deictic referents (e.g., objects of see, know) (EQ-bias verbs). In these cases the preference is determined by NP-form of the anaphor (pronoun vs. demonstrative). 4.2 Types of Abstract Antecedents We follow Asher (1993) in assuming that the predicate of a discourse deictic anaphor determines the type of abstract object. An anaphor in the object position of the verb do, for example, can only have a VP (eventconcept) antecedent (eg John [sang]. Bill did that too.), whereas an anaphor in the subject position of the predicate is true requires a full S (proposition) (eg [John sang]. That&apos;s true.). This verbal subcategorisation information is used to determine which part of the preceding I is required to form the correct referent. Following Webber and others, we assume that an abstract object is only introduced to</context>

In theories relating cognitive status and choice of NP-form (cf. Gundel et al. (1993)), pronouns are only available for the most salient entities, whereas demonstratives can be used to shift the focus of attention to a different entity. A further 19.1% of anaphors are InferrableEvoked Pronouns (IEPro) and constitute a particular type of plural pronoun which indirectly co-specifies with a singular antecedent. This group includes existential, generic and corporate 3rd person plural pronouns (Jaeggli, 1986; Belletti and Rizzi, 1988).

We assume that discourse entities enter the joint discourse model and are available for subsequent reference when common ground between the discourse participants is established. Our model builds on the observation that certain dialogue acts — in particular acknowledgments — signal that common ground is achieved. Our assumptions are based on Clark&apos;s (1989) theory of contributions (cf. also Traum (1994)). Each dialogue is divided into short, clearly defined dialogue acts — Initiations I and Acknowledgments A — based on the top of the hierarchy given in Carletta et al. (1997). Each sentence and each conjoined clause counts as a separate I, even if they are part of the same turn. A&apos;s do not convey semantic content but have a pragmatic function (e.g., backchannel). In addition there are utterances which function as an A but also have semantic content — these are labelled as All. A single I is paired with an A and they jointly form a Synchronising Unit (SU). In longer turns, each main clause functions as a separate unit along with its subordinate clauses. Single I&apos;s constitute SU&apos;s by themselves and do not require explicit acknowledgment.

One of the differences between individual and discourse deictic anaphora is that whereas a concrete NP antecedent usually only refers to the individual it describes, a sentence may simultaneously denote an eventuality, a concept, a proposition and a fact. Instead of assuming that all levels of abstract objects are introduced to the discourse model by the sentence that makes them available, it has been suggested that anaphoric discourse deictic reference involves referent coercion (Webber, 1991; Asher, 1993; Dahl and Hellman, 1995). This assumption is further justified by the fact that discourse deictic reference, as opposed to individual anaphoric reference, is often established by demonstratives rather than pronouns. In theories relating cognitive status and choice of NP-form (cf. Gundel et al. (1993)), pronouns are only available for the most salient entities, whereas demonstratives can be used to shift the focus of attention to a different entity.

In the algorithm, we make use of the notion of anaphorantecedent Compatibility to distinguish between discourse deictic and individual reference. Certain predicates (notably verbs of propositional attitude) require one of their arguments to have a referent whose meaning is correlated with sentences, e.g., is true, assume (referred to as SC-bias verbs in Garnsey et al. (1997) and elsewhere). Pronouns in these positions rarely have concrete individual NP-antecedents and are generally only compatible with discourse deictic referents. Other argument positions are preferentially associated with concrete individuals (e.g., objects of eat, smell) (DO-bias verbs).

This indicates that the anaphor classification requires improvement, in particular the notion of Compatibility. Lists of verb biases for sentential and NP complements, as described in psycholinguistic studies (e.g. Garnsey et al. (1997)), could be used to classify verbs. Currently exisiting lists only account for a small number of verbs but there may be the possibility of adding statistical information from large corpora of spoken dialogue. Furthermore, the algorithm currently ignores abstract NPs (e.g., story, exercising) when looking for antecedents for anaphors with I-incompatible predicates. We are considering determining the feature abstract for all NPs in order to identify those which can act as antecedents in such contexts.

First, the corpus was annotated for all relevant features, i.e., division of turns into dialogue act units, classification of dialogue acts (I, A), marking of noun phrases, classification of the various types of anaphors introduced in Section 2, and annotating coreference between anaphors and individual/abstract discourse entities. The last step provided the key for the test of the algorithm described in Section 4.3. 5.1 Annotation Our data consisted of five randomly selected dialogues from the Switchboard corpus of spoken telephone conversations (LDC, 1993).

This means that the entity referred to in that utterance (orange warehouse) is immediately removed from the joint discourse model. Thus there in the final two turns co-specifies with Corning and not the most recent orange warehouse. 4 How to Resolve Discourse Deictic Anaphora We now turn to our method of anaphora resolution, which extends the algorithm presented in Strube (1998), in order to be able to account for discourse deictic anaphora as well as individual anaphora. 4.1 Anaphor-antecedent Compatibility As indicated in Section 2, information provided by the subcategorisation frame of the anaphor&apos;s predicate can be used to determine the type of the referent. In the algorithm, we make use of the notion of anaphorantecedent Compatibility to distinguish between discourse deictic and individual reference. Certain predicates (notably verbs of propositional attitude) require one of their arguments to have a referent whose meaning is correlated with sentences, e.g., is </context>

An anaphor in the object position of the verb do, for example, can only have a VP (eventconcept) antecedent (eg John [sang]. Bill did that too.), whereas an anaphor in the subject position of the predicate is true requires a full S (proposition) (eg [John sang]. That&apos;s true.). This verbal subcategorisation information is used to determine which part of the preceding I is required to form the correct referent. Following Webber and others, we assume that an abstract object is only introduced to the discourse model by the anaphor itself. In addition to the S-List (Strube, 1998), which contains the referents of NPs available for anaphoric reference, our model includes &apos;These are preferences and not strict rules because some 1-Incompatible contexts are compatible with NPs denoting abstract objects, e.g., The story/It is true. and NPs which are used to stand elliptically for an event or state, e.g., His car/It is the reason why he&apos;s late. This shows that predicate compatibility must ultimately be defined in semantic terms and not just rely on syntactic strings (NP vs. S). an A-List for abstract objects.

Hence we define this domain in pragmatic terms. We assume that discourse entities enter the joint discourse model and are available for subsequent reference when common ground between the discourse participants is established. Our model builds on the observation that certain dialogue acts — in particular acknowledgments — signal that common ground is achieved. Our assumptions are based on Clark&apos;s (1989) theory of contributions (cf. also Traum (1994)). Each dialogue is divided into short, clearly defined dialogue acts — Initiations I and Acknowledgments A — based on the top of the hierarchy given in Carletta et al. (1997). Each sentence and each conjoined clause counts as a separate I, even if they are part of the same turn. A&apos;s do not convey semantic content but have a pragmatic function (e.g., backchannel). In addition there are utterances which function as an A but also have semantic content — these are labelled as All. A single I is paired with an A and they jointly form a Synchronising Unit (SU). In longer turns, each main clause fun</context>

Another 22.6% are anaphors whose referents are not individual, concrete entities but events, facts and propositions, e.g., (1) B.7: [We never know what they&apos;re thinking]. A.8: That&apos;s right. [I don&apos;t trust them]3, maybe I guess iti &apos;s because of what happened over there with their own people, how they threw them out of power. (sw3241) Whilst there have been attempts to classify abstract objects and the rules governing anaphoric reference to them (Webber, 1991; Asher, 1993; Dahl and Hellman, 1995), there have been no exhaustive, empirical studies using actual resolution algorithms. These have so far only been applied to written corpora. However, the high frequency of abstract object anaphora in dialogues means that any attempt to resolve anaphors in spoken language cannot succeed without taking this into account. Summarised below are some issues specific to anaphora resolution in spoken dialogues (see also Byron and Stent (1998) who mention some of these problems in their account of the Centering model (Grosz et al., 1995)).

In Section 5, we report on the corpus annotation and the evaluation of the algorithm. 2 Anaphor Types in Dialogues In the dialogues examined, only 45.1% of the anaphors are individual anaphors, i.e., anaphors with NPantecedents (IPro, IDem), e.g., (3) Boeing ought to hire himi and give himi a junkyardi, ... and see if hei could build a Seven Forty-Seven out of itj. (sw2102) 22.6% of the anaphors are discourse deictic, i.e. co-specify with non-NP constituents such as VPs, sentences, strings of sentences (DDPro, DDDem; cf. Webber (1991)). The phenomenon of discourse deictic anaphora in written texts has been shown to be strongly dependent on discourse structure. As can also be seen in the examples below, anaphoric reference is restricted to elements adjacent to the utterance containing the anaphor, i.e., those on the right frontier of the discourse structure tree (Webber, 1991; Asher, 1993): (4) A.46: [The government don&apos;t tell you everything.] i B.47: I know iti (sw3241) (5) Now why didn&apos;t she [take him over there with her],? No, she didn&apos;t do thati. (sw4877) The existence of abstract object anaphora shows that aside from i</context>

One of the most common errors in classification was, that an anaphor annotated as vague (VagPro, VagDem) was classified by the algorithm as discourse deictic (DDPro, DDDem). Classification is dependent on resolution, so since the context almost always provides an antecedent for a discourse deictic anaphor, it is possible to classify and resolve a vague anaphor incorrectly, as in Example 13: (13) A: [I don&apos;t know] , I think it, really depends a lot on the child. (sw3 I 17) 6 Comparison to Related Work Both Webber (1991) and Asher (1993) describe the phenomenon of abstract object anaphora and present restrictions on the set of potential antecedents. They do not, however, concern themselves with the problem of how to classify a certain pronoun or demonstrative as individual or abstract. Also, as they do not give preferences on the set of potential candidates, their approaches are not intended as attempts to resolve abstract object anaphora. Concerning anaphora resolution in dialogues, only little research has been carried out in this area to our knowledge. LuperFoy (1992) does not present a corpus study, meani</context>
