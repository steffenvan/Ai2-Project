Abstract
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999861384615385">
We have previously introduced a method
of word sense disambiguation that com-
putes the intended sense of a target word,
using WordNet-based measures of seman-
tic relatedness (Patwardhan et al., 2003).
SenseRelate::TargetWord is a Perl pack-
age that implements this algorithm. The
disambiguation process is carried out by
selecting that sense of the target word
which is most related to the context words.
Relatedness between word senses is mea-
sured using the WordNet::Similarity Perl
modules.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999918">
Many words have different meanings when used in
different contexts. Word Sense Disambiguation is
the task of identifying the intended meaning of a
given target word from the context in which it is
used. (Lesk, 1986) performed disambiguation by
counting the number of overlaps between the dic-
tionary definitions (i.e., glosses) of the target word
and those of the neighboring words in the con-
text. (Banerjee and Pedersen, 2002) extended this
method of disambiguation by expanding the glosses
of words to include glosses of related words, accord-
ing to the structure of WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998).
In subsequent work, (Patwardhan et al., 2003) and
(Banerjee and Pedersen, 2003) proposed that mea-
suring gloss overalps is just one way of determin-
ing semantic relatedness, and that word sense dis-
ambiguation can be performed by finding the most

related sense of a target word to its surrounding con-
text using a wide variety of measures of relatedness.
SenseRelate::TargetWord is a Perl package that
implements these ideas, and is able to disambiguate
a target word in context by finding the sense that is
most related to its neighbors according to a speci-
fied measure. A user of this package is able to make
a variety of choices for text preprocessing options,
context selection, relatedness measure selection and
the selection of an algorithm for computing the over-
all relatedness between each sense of the target word
and words in the surrounding context. The user can
customize each of these choices to fit the needs of
her specific disambiguation task. Further, the vari-
ous sub-tasks in the package are implemented in a
modular fashion, allowing the user to easily replace
a module with her own module if needed.
The following sections describe the generalized
framework for Word Sense Disambiguation, the ar-
chitecture and usage of SenseRelate::TargetWord,
and a description of the user interfaces (command
line and GUI).

2 The Framework
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9994998">
The package has a highly modular architecture. The
disambiguation process is divided into a number of
smaller sub-tasks, each of which is represented by
a separate module. Each of the sequential sub-tasks
or stages accepts data from a previous stage, per-
forms a transformation on the data, and then passes
on the processed data structures to the next stage in
the pipeline. We have created a protocol that defines
the structure and format of the data that is passed
between the stages. The user can create her own

modules to perform any of these sub-tasks as long
as the modules adhere to the protocol laid down by
the package.
Figure 1 projects an overview of the architecture
of the system and shows the various sub-tasks that
need to be performed to carry out word sense dis-
ambiguation. The sub-tasks in the dotted boxes are
optional. Further, each of the sub-tasks can be per-
formed in a number of different ways, implying that
the package can be customized in a large number of
ways to suit different disambiguation needs.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.991573">
2.1 Format Filter
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999984454545454">
The filter takes as input file(s) annotated in the
SENSEVAL-2 lexical sample format, which is an
XML–based format that has been used for both the
SENSEVAL-2 and SENSEVAL-3 exercises. A file in
this format includes a number of instances, each one
made up of 2 to 3 lines of text where a single tar-
get word is designated with an XML tag. The fil-
ter parses the input file to build data structures that
represent the instances to be disambiguated, which
includes a single target word and the surrounding
words that define the context.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999047">
2.2 Preprocessing
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999871666666667">
SenseRelate::TargetWord expects zero or more text
preprocessing modules, each of which perform a
transformation on the input words. For example, the
Compound Detection Module identifies sequences
of tokens that form compound words that are known
as concepts to WordNet (such as “New York City”).
In order to ensure that compounds are treated as a
single unit, the package replaces them in the instance
with the corresponding underscore–connected form
(“New York City”).
Multiple preprocessing modules can be chained
together, the output of one connected to the input of
the next, to form a single preprocessing stage. For
example, a part of speech tagging module could be
added after compound detection.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997759">
2.3 Context Selection
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999864269230769">
Disambiguation is performed by finding the sense of
the target word that is most related to the words in
its surrounding context. The package allows for var-
ious methods of determining what exactly the sur-
rounding context should consist of. In the current
implementation, the context selection module uses
an n word window around the target word as con-
text. The window includes the target word, and ex-
tends to both the left and right. The module selects
the n − 1 words that are located closest to the target
word, and sends these words (and the target) on to
the next module for disambiguation. Note that these
words must all be known to WordNet, and should
not include any stop–words.
However, not all words in the surrounding context
are indicative of the correct sense of the target word.
An intelligent selection of the context words used in
the disambiguation process could potentially yield
much better results and generate a solution faster
than if all the nearby words were used. For exam-
ple, we could instead select the nouns from the win-
dow of context that have a high term–frequency to
document–frequency ratio. Or, we could identify
lexical chains in the surrounding context, and only
include those words that are found in chains that in-
clude the target word.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.98187">
2.4 Sense Inventory
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999964909090909">
After having reduced the context to n words, the
Sense Inventory stage determines the possible senses
of each of the n words. This list can be obtained
from a dictionary, such as WordNet. A thesaurus
could also be used for the purpose. Note however,
that the subsequent modules in the pipeline should
be aware of the codes assigned to the word senses.
In our system, this module first decides the base
(uninflected) form of each of the n words. It then
retrieves all the senses for each word from the sense
inventory. We use WordNet for our sense inventory.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.977958">
2.5 Postprocessing
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999971111111111">
Some optional processing can be performed on the
data structures generated by the Sense Inventory
module. This would include tasks such as sense
pruning, which is the process of removing some
senses from the inventory, based on simple heuris-
tics, algorithms or options. For example, the user
may decide to preclude all verb senses of the target
word from further consideration in the disambigua-
tion process.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.992095">
2.6 Identifying the Sense
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999987466666667">
The disambiguation module takes the lists of senses
of the target word and those of the context words and
uses this information to pick one sense of the tar-
get word as the answer. Many different algorithms
could be used to do this. We have modules Local
and Global that (in different ways) determine the re-
latedness of each of the senses of the target word
with those of the context words, and pick the most
related sense as the answer. These are described
in greater detail by (Banerjee and Pedersen, 2002),
but in general the Local method compares the target
word to its neighbors in a pair-wise fashion, while
the Global method carries out an exhaustive compar-
ison between all the senses of the target word and all
the senses of the neighbors.

3 Using SenseRelate::TargetWord
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997482777777778">
SenseRelate::TargetWord can be used via the
command-line interface provided by the utility pro-
gram called disamb.pl. It provides a rich variety of
options for controlling the process of disambigua-
tion. Or, it can be embedded into Perl programs,
by including it as a module and calling its various
methods. Finally, there is a graphical interface to
the package that allows a user to highlight a word in
context to be disambiguated.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998899">
3.1 Command Line
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999977384615385">
The command-line interface disamb.pl takes as input
a SENSEVAL-2 formatted lexical sample file. The
program disambiguates the marked up word in each
instance and prints to screen the instance ID, along
with the disambiguated sense of the target word.
Command line options are available to control the
disambiguation process. For example, a user can
specify which relatedness measure they would like
to use, whether disambiguation should be carried out
using Local or Global methods, how large a win-
dow of context around the target word is to be used,
and whether or not all the parts of speech of a word
should be considered.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999885">
3.2 Programming Interface
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998154">
SenseRelate::TargetWord is distributed as a Perl
package. It is programmed in object-oriented Perl
as a group of Perl classes. Objects of these classes
can be instantiated in user programs, and meth-
ods can be called on these objects. The pack-
age requires that the Perl interface to WordNet,
WordNet::QueryData1 be installed on the system.
The disambiguation algorithms also require that the
semantic relatedness measures WordNet::Similarity
(Pedersen et al., 2004) be installed.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999838">
3.3 Graphical User Interface
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9995888">
We have developed a graphical interface for the
package in order to conveniently access the disam-
biguation modules. The GUI is written in Gtk-Perl
– a Perl API to the Gtk toolkit. Unlike the command
line interface, the graphical interface is not tied to
any input file format. The interface allows the user to
input text, and to select the word to disambiguate. It
also provides the user with numerous configuration
options corresponding to the various customizations
described above.

<bodyText confidence="0.9999946">
There is a long history of work in Word Sense Dis-
ambiguation that uses Machine Readable Dictionar-
ies, and are highly related to our approach.
One of the first approaches was that of (Lesk,
1986), which treated every dictionary definition of
a concept as a bag of words. To identify the in-
tended sense of the target word, the Lesk algorithm
would determine the number of word overlaps be-
tween the definitions of each of the meanings of the
target word, and those of the context words. The
meaning of the target word with maximum defini-
tion overlap with the context words was selected as
the intended sense.
(Wilks et al., 1993) developed a context vector
approach for performing word sense disambigua-
tion. Their algorithm built co-occurrence vectors
from dictionary definitions using Longman’s Dictio-
nary of Contemporary English (LDOCE). They then
determined the extent of overlap between the sum of
the vectors of the words in the context and the sum
of the vectors of the words in each of the definitions
(of the target word). For vectors, the extent of over-
lap is defined as the dot product of the vectors. The
meaning of the target word that had the maximum
overlap was selected as the answer.
More recently, (McCarthy et al., 2004) present a
method that performs disambiguation by determing
the most frequent sense of a word in a particular do-
main. This is based on measuring the relatedness
of the different possible senses of a target word (us-
ing WordNet::Similarity) to a set of words associated
with a particular domain that have been identified
using distributional methods. The relatedness scores
between a target word and the members of this set
are scaled by the distributional similarity score.

Their algorithm built co-occurrence vectors from dictionary definitions using Longman’s Dictionary of Contemporary English (LDOCE). They then determined the extent of overlap between the sum of the vectors of the words in the context and the sum of the vectors of the words in each of the definitions (of the target word). For vectors, the extent of overlap is defined as the dot product of the vectors. The meaning of the target word that had the maximum overlap was selected as the answer. More recently, (McCarthy et al., 2004) present a method that performs disambiguation by determing the most frequent sense of a word in a particular domain. This is based on measuring the relatedness of the different possible senses of a target word (using WordNet::Similarity) to a set of words associated with a particular domain that have been identified using distributional methods. The relatedness scores between a target word and the members of this set are scaled by the distributional similarity score. 5 Availability SenseRelate::TargetWord is written in Perl and is freely distributed under the Gnu Public License.

Word Sense Disambiguation is the task of identifying the intended meaning of a given target word from the context in which it is used. (Lesk, 1986) performed disambiguation by counting the number of overlaps between the dictionary definitions (i.e., glosses) of the target word and those of the neighboring words in the context. (Banerjee and Pedersen, 2002) extended this method of disambiguation by expanding the glosses of words to include glosses of related words, according to the structure of WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998). In subsequent work, (Patwardhan et al., 2003) and (Banerjee and Pedersen, 2003) proposed that measuring gloss overalps is just one way of determining semantic relatedness, and that word sense disambiguation can be performed by finding the most 73 related sense of a target word to its surrounding context using a wide variety of measures of relatedness. SenseRelate::TargetWord is a Perl package that implements these ideas, and is able to disambiguate a target word in context by finding the sense that is most related to its neighbors according to a specified measure. A user of this package is able to make a variety of choices for text prepr</context>

It is programmed in object-oriented Perl as a group of Perl classes. Objects of these classes can be instantiated in user programs, and methods can be called on these objects. The package requires that the Perl interface to WordNet, WordNet::QueryData1 be installed on the system. The disambiguation algorithms also require that the semantic relatedness measures WordNet::Similarity (Pedersen et al., 2004) be installed. 3.3 Graphical User Interface We have developed a graphical interface for the package in order to conveniently access the disambiguation modules. The GUI is written in Gtk-Perl – a Perl API to the Gtk toolkit. Unlike the command line interface, the graphical interface is not tied to any input file format. The interface allows the user to input text, and to select the word to disambiguate. It also provides the user with numerous configuration options corresponding to the various customizations described above. 1http://search.cpan.org/dist/WordNet-QueryData 75 4 Related Work There </context>

One of the first approaches was that of (Lesk, 1986), which treated every dictionary definition of a concept as a bag of words. To identify the intended sense of the target word, the Lesk algorithm would determine the number of word overlaps between the definitions of each of the meanings of the target word, and those of the context words. The meaning of the target word with maximum definition overlap with the context words was selected as the intended sense. (Wilks et al., 1993) developed a context vector approach for performing word sense disambiguation. Their algorithm built co-occurrence vectors from dictionary definitions using Longman’s Dictionary of Contemporary English (LDOCE). They then determined the extent of overlap between the sum of the vectors of the words in the context and the sum of the vectors of the words in each of the definitions (of the target word). For vectors, the extent of overlap is defined as the dot product of the vectors. The meaning of the target word that had the maximum overlap was selected as the answer.
