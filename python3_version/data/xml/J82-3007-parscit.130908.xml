The theme of the conference is system usability.
Individual papers, sessions, and tutorials are invited on
all topics relating to the performance and satisfaction
of the user of computer systems. In addition, empiri-
cal studies of the effect of interactive systems on or-
ganization behavior are welcomed. Investigations of
the impact on the user of various input and output
modes are also requested. Reports on human factors
studies of intelligent systems and on cognitive models
of users are appropriate for presentation. Similarly,
work on human factors issues in programming and
documentation is requested. Suggestions and recom-

Martha Evens and Lauri Karttunen have been con-
tacting graduate departments in linguistics, computer
science, and the cognitive and information sciences to
identify graduate programs and courses in computa-
tional linguistics. Coverage for the United States and
Canada is reasonable, although probably not complete.
However, there is relatively little information from
Europe and Asia, and none at all from Australia and
Africa. The following items are required: the name of
the institution, its address, and an appropriate tele-
phone number for contact; the graduate degrees
awarded and the departments awarding them; the fac-
ulty members involved in CL, their departmental affili-
ations and research areas; CL courses with names and
numbers; any special programs; current or recent re-
search projects of interest; and computational facili-
ties. To insure adequate coverage world-wide, we
need your help in identifying institutions and in secur-
ing the needed information. Please respond directly to

Epstein Memorial Fund Established
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996537486486486">
In memory of Dr. Martin N. Epstein, former direc-
tor of the Medical Computer Science Research Group
at the National Library of Medicine&apos;s Lister Hill Na-
tional Center for Biomedical Communication, his
friends have established the SCAMC/Epstein Memori-
al Fund. The fund will be used for an award to be
given to students of medical computing. Proposed
ideas for the award range from an annual SCAMC
student paper competition to a scholarship, depending
upon the amount contributed. SCAMC is the annual
Symposium on Computer Applications in Medical
Care.
Marty&apos;s long and distinguished career as a comput-
er scientist in the Public Health Service Commissioned
Corps at the National Institutes of Health began in
1964. Over the years, he served as a staff member of
three NIH components: first, at the Division of Re-
search Services; later, at the Division of Computer
Research and Technology; and last, at the National
Library of Medicine. His extensive knowledge of both
medicine and computer science, and his ability to com-
municate effectively with people in both disciplines,
made him a particularly valuable contributor to the
field of computers and medicine.
Marty was a long-time member of the Association
for Computational Linguistics. While on leave from
NIH at the University of California, San Francisco, he
developed MEDINQUIRY, a system that provided
physicians with natural language access to information
from patient medical records. He was continuing work
on that project, as well as on a number of related ef-
forts, at NLM at the time of his death. The goal of all
his research was furthering biomedical communication.
His accomplishments throughout his career constitute
significant steps toward that objective.
Donations to the fund are tax-deductible. Contrib-
utions may be sent to:

<abstract confidence="0.94364447368421">Epstein Memorial Fund Established In memory of Dr. Martin N. Epstein, former director of the Medical Computer Science Research Group at the National Library of Medicine&apos;s Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communication, his friends have established the SCAMC/Epstein Memorial Fund. The fund will be used for an award to be given to students of medical computing. Proposed ideas for the award range from an annual SCAMC student paper competition to a scholarship, depending upon the amount contributed. SCAMC is the annual Symposium on Computer Applications in Medical Care. Marty&apos;s long and distinguished career as a computer scientist in the Public Health Service Commissioned Corps at the National Institutes of Health began in 1964. Over the years, he served as a staff member of three NIH components: first, at the Division of Research Services; later, at the Division of Computer Research and Technology; and last, at the National Library of Medicine. His extensive knowledge of both medicine and computer science, and his ability to communicate effectively with people in both disciplines, made him a particularly valuable contributor to the field of computers and medicine. Marty was a long-time member of the Association for Computational Linguistics. While on leave from NIH at the University of California, San Francisco, he developed MEDINQUIRY, a system that provided physicians with natural language access to information from patient medical records. He was continuing work on that project, as well as on a number of related efforts, at NLM at the time of his death. The goal of all his research was furthering biomedical communication. His accomplishments throughout his career constitute significant steps toward that objective. Donations to the fund are tax-deductible. Contributions may be sent to:</abstract>
