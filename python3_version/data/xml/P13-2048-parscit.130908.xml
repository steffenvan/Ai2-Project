We present IndoNet, a multilingual lexi-
cal knowledge base for Indian languages.
It is a linked structure of wordnets of
18 different Indian languages, Universal
Word dictionary and the Suggested Up-
per Merged Ontology (SUMO). We dis-
cuss various benefits of the network and
challenges involved in the development.
The system is encoded in Lexical Markup
Framework (LMF) and we propose mod-
ifications in LMF to accommodate Uni-
versal Word Dictionary and SUMO. This
standardized version of lexical knowledge
base of Indian Languages can now easily
be linked to similar global resources.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999771756097561">
Lexical resources play an important role in nat-
ural language processing tasks. Past couple of
decades have shown an immense growth in the de-
velopment of lexical resources such as wordnet,
Wikipedia, ontologies etc. These resources vary
significantly in structure and representation for-
malism.
In order to develop applications that can make
use of different resources, it is essential to link
these heterogeneous resources and develop a com-
mon representation framework. However, the dif-
ferences in encoding of knowledge and multilin-
guality are the major road blocks in development
of such a framework. Particularly, in a multilin-
gual country like India, information is available in
many different languages. In order to exchange in-
formation across cultures and languages, it is es-
sential to create an architecture to share various
lexical resources across languages.
In this paper we present IndoNet, a lexical re-
source created by merging wordnets of 18 dif-
ferent Indian languages1, Universal Word Dictio-
nary (Uchida et al., 1999) and an upper ontology,
SUMO (Niles and Pease, 2001).
Universal Word (UW), defined by a headword
and a set of restrictions which give an unambigu-
ous representation of the concept, forms the vo-
cabulary of Universal Networking Language. Sug-
gested Upper Merged Ontology (SUMO) is the
largest freely available ontology which is linked
to the entire English WordNet (Niles and Pease,
2003). Though UNL is a graph based repre-
sentation and SUMO is a formal ontology, both
provide language independent conceptualization.
This makes them suitable candidates for interlin-
gua.
IndoNet is encoded in Lexical Markup Frame-
work (LMF), an ISO standard (ISO-24613) for
encoding lexical resources (Francopoulo et al.,
2009).
The contribution of this work is twofold,

Over the years wordnet has emerged as the most
widely used lexical resource. Though most of the
wordnets are built by following the standards laid
by English Wordnet (Fellbaum, 1998), their con-
ceptualizations differ because of the differences in
lexicalization of concepts across languages. ‘Not

doWordNet project. Wordnets are available in following
Indian languages: Assamese, Bodo, Bengali, English, Gu-
jarati, Hindi, Kashmiri, Konkani, Kannada, Malayalam, Ma-
nipuri, Marathi, Nepali, Punjabi, Sanskrit, Tamil, Telugu and
Urdu. These languages covers 3 different language families,
Indo Aryan, Sino-Tebetian and Dravidian.http://www.

only that, there exist lexical gaps where a word
in one language has no correspondence in another
language, but there are differences in the ways lan-
guages structure their words and concepts’. (Pease
and Fellbaum, 2010).
The challenge of constructing a unified multi-
lingual resource was first addressed in EuroWord-
Net (Vossen, 1998). EuroWordNet linked word-
nets of 8 different European languages through
a common interlingual index (ILI). ILI consists
of English synsets and serves as a pivot to link
other wordnets. While ILI allows each language
wordnet to preserve its semantic structure, it has
two basic drawbacks as described in Fellbaum and
Vossen (2012),
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.77285775">
1. An ILI tied to one specific language clearly
reflects only the inventory of the language it
is based on, and gaps show up when lexicons
of different languages are mapped to it.
2. The semantic space covered by a word in one
language often overlaps only partially with a
similar word in another language, resulting in
less than perfect mappings.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.980168818181818">
Subsequently in KYOTO project2, ontologies are
preferred over ILI for linking of concepts of dif-
ferent languages. Ontologies provide language in-
dpendent conceptualization, hence the linking re-
mains unbiased to a particular language. Top level
ontology SUMO is used to link common base
concepts across languages. Because of the small
size of the top level ontology, only a few wordnet
synsets can be linked directly to the ontological
concept and most of the synsets get linked through
subsumption relation. This leads to a significant
amount of information loss.
KYOTO project used Lexical Markup Frame-
work (LMF) (Francopoulo et al., 2009) as a rep-
resentation language. ‘LMF provides a com-
mon model for the creation and use of lexical re-
sources, to manage the exchange of data among
these resources, and to enable the merging of a
large number of individual electronic resources to
form extensive global electronic resources’ (Fran-
copoulo et al., 2009). Soria et al. (2009) proposed
WordNet-LMF to represent wordnets in LMF for-
mat. Henrich and Hinrichs (2010) have further
modified Wordnet-LMF to accommodate lexical

relations. LMF also provides extensions for multi-
lingual lexicons and for linking external resources,
such as ontology. However, LMF does not explic-
itly define standards to share a common ontology
among multilingual lexicons.
Our work falls in line with EuroWordNet and
Kyoto except for the following key differences,
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.984588538461538">
• Instead of using ILI, we use a ‘common con-
cept hierarchy’ as a backbone to link lexicons
of different languages.
• In addition to an upper ontology, a concept in
common concept hierarchy is also linked to
Universal Word Dictionary. Universal Word
dictionary provides additional semantic in-
formation regarding argument types of verbs,
that can be used to provide clues for selec-
tional preference of a verb.
• We refine LMF to link external resources
(e.g. ontologies) with multilingual lexicon
and to represent Universal Word Dictionary.

IndoNet uses a common concept hierarchy to
link various heterogeneous lexical resources. As
shown in figure 1, concepts of different wordnets,
Universal Word Dictionary and Upper Ontology
are merged to form the common concept hierar-
chy. Figure 1 shows how concepts of English
WordNet (EWN), Hindi Wordnet (HWN), upper
ontology (SUMO) and Universal Word Dictionary
(UWD) are linked through common concept hier-
archy (CCH).

The common concept hierarchy is an abstract pivot
index to link lexical resources of all languages. An
element of a common concept hierarchy is defined
as &lt; sinid1, sinid2, ..., uwid, sumoid &gt; where,
sinidi is synset id of ith wordnet, uw id is univer-
sal word id, and sumo id is SUMO term id of the
concept. Unlike ILI, the hypernymy-hyponymy
relations from different wordnets are merged to
construct the concept hierarchy. Each synset of
wordnet is directly linked to a concept in ‘com-
mon concept hierarchy’.

3.3 LMF for Universal Word Dictionary
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998547473684211">
A Universal Word is composed of a headword and
a list of restrictions, that provide unique meaning
of the UW. In our architecture we allow each sense
of a headword to have more than one set of restric-
tions (defined by different UW dictionaries) and
be linked to lemmas of multiple languages with a
confidence score. This allows us to merge multiple
UW dictionaries and represent it in LMF format.
We introduce four new LMF classes; Restrictions,
Restriction, Lemmas and Lemma and add new at-
tributes; headword and mapping score to existing
LMF classes.
Figure 2 shows an example of LMF represen-
tation of UW Dictionary. At present, the dic-
tionary is created by merging two dictionaries,
UW++ (Boguslavsky et al., 2007) and CFILT
Hin-UW3. Lemmas from different languages are
mapped to universal words and stored under the
Lemmas class.

to ‘uncle’ but there are two more specific concepts
‘kaka’, ‘brother of father.’ and ‘mama’, ‘brother

The lexical gap is captured when these con-
cepts are linked to CCH. Through CCH, these con-
cepts are linked to SUMO term ‘FamilyRelation’
which shows relation between these concepts.
Universal Word Dictionary captures exact rela-
tion between these concepts by applying restric-

and [mama] uncle(icl&gt;brother (mod&gt;mother)).
This makes it possible to link concepts across lan-

5 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999795923076923">
We have presented a multilingual lexical resource
for Indian languages. The proposed architecture
handles the ‘lexical gap’ and ‘structural diver-
gence’ among languages, by building a common
concept hierarchy. In order to encode this resource
in LMF, we developed standards to represent UW
in LMF.
IndoNet is emerging as the largest multilingual
resource covering 18 languages of 3 different lan-
guage families and it is possible to link or merge
other standardized lexical resources with it.
Since Universal Word dictionary is an integral
part of the system, it can be used for UNL based

<bodyText confidence="0.9993574">
Machine Translation tasks. Ontological structure
of the system can be used for multilingual infor-
mation retrieval and extraction.
In future, we aim to address ontological issues
of the common concept hierarchy and integrate
domain ontologies with the system. We are also
aiming to develop standards to evaluate such mul-
tilingual resources and to validate axiomatic foun-
dation of the same. We plan to make this resource
freely available to researchers.

Ontologies provide language indpendent conceptualization, hence the linking remains unbiased to a particular language. Top level ontology SUMO is used to link common base concepts across languages. Because of the small size of the top level ontology, only a few wordnet synsets can be linked directly to the ontological concept and most of the synsets get linked through subsumption relation. This leads to a significant amount of information loss.

(Pease and Fellbaum, 2010). The challenge of constructing a unified multilingual resource was first addressed in EuroWordNet (Vossen, 1998). EuroWordNet linked wordnets of 8 different European languages through a common interlingual index (ILI). ILI consists of English synsets and serves as a pivot to link other wordnets. While ILI allows each language wordnet to preserve its semantic structure, it has two basic drawbacks as described in Fellbaum and Vossen (2012), 1. An ILI tied to one specific language clearly reflects only the inventory of the language it is based on, and gaps show up when lexicons of different lang</context>

An element of a common concept hierarchy is defined as &lt; sinid1, sinid2, ..., uwid, sumoid &gt; where, sinidi is synset id of ith wordnet, uw id is universal word id, and sumo id is SUMO term id of the concept. Unlike ILI, the hypernymy-hyponymy relations from different wordnets are merged to construct the concept hierarchy. Each synset of wordnet is directly linked to a concept in ‘common concept hierarchy’. 3.2 LMF for Wordnet We have adapted the Wordnet-LMF, as specified in Soria et al. (2009). However IndoWordnet encodes more lexical relations compared to EuroWordnet. We enhanced the Wordnet-LMF to accommodate the following relations: antonym, gradation, hypernymy, meronym, troponymy, entailment and cross part of speech links for ability and capability. 3.3 LMF for Universal Word Dictionary A Universal Word is composed of a headword and a list of restrictions, that provide unique meaning of the UW.
