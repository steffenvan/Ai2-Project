Supervised word sense disambiguation re-
quires training corpora that have been tagged
with word senses, which begs the question of
which word senses to tag with. The default
choice has been WordNet, with its broad cov-
erage and easy accessibility. However, con-
cerns have been raised about the
appropriateness of its fine-grained word
senses for WSD. WSD systems have been far
more successful in distinguishing coarse-
grained senses than fine-grained ones (Navig-
li, 2006), but does that approach neglect ne-
cessary meaning differences? Recent
psycholinguistic evidence seems to indicate
that closely related word senses may be
represented in the mental lexicon much like a
single sense, whereas distantly related senses
may be represented more like discrete entities.
These results suggest that, for the purposes of
WSD, closely related word senses can be clus-
tered together into a more general sense with
little meaning loss. The current paper will de-
scribe this psycholinguistic research and its
implications for automatic word sense disam-
biguation.

The problem of creating a successful word sense
disambiguation system begins, or should begin,
well before methods or algorithms are considered.
The first question should be, “Which senses do we
want to be able to distinguish?” Dictionaries en-

courage us to consider words as having a discrete
set of senses, yet any comparison between dictio-
naries quickly reveals how differently a word’s
meaning can be divided into separate senses.
Rather than having a finite list of senses, many
words seem to have senses that shade from one
into another.
One could assume that dictionaries make broad-
ly similar divisions and the exact point of division
is only a minor detail. Simply picking one resource
and sticking with it should solve the problem. In
fact, WordNet, with its broad coverage and easy
accessibility, has become the resource of choice for
WSD. However, some have questioned whether
WordNet’s fine-grained sense distinctions are ap-
propriate for the task (Ide &amp; Wilks, 2007; Palmer
et al., 2007). Some are concerned about feasibility:
Is WSD at this level an unattainable goal? Others
with practicality: Is this level of detail really
needed for most NLP tasks, such as machine trans-
lation or question-answering? Finally, some won-
der whether such fine-grained distinctions even
reflect how human beings represent word meaning.
Human annotators have trouble distinguishing
such fine-grained senses reliably. Interannotator
agreement with WordNet senses is around 70%
(Snyder &amp; Palmer, 2004; Chklovski &amp; Mihalcea,
2002), and it’s understandable that WSD systems
would have difficulty surpassing this upper bound.
Researchers have responded to these concerns
by developing various ways to cluster WordNet
senses. Mihalcea &amp; Moldovan (2001) created an
unsupervised approach that uses rules to cluster
senses. Navigli (2006) has induced clusters by
mapping WordNet senses to a more coarse-grained
lexical resource. OntoNotes (Hovy et al., 2006) is
manually grouping WordNet senses and creating a
corpus tagged with these sense groups. Using On-

toNotes and another set of manually tagged data,
Snow et al. (2007) have developed a supervised
method of clustering WordNet senses.
Although ITA rates and system performance
both significantly improve with coarse-grained
senses (Duffield et al., 2007; Navigli, 2006), the
question about what level of granularity is needed
remains. Palmer et al. (2007) state, “If too much
information is being lost by failing to make the
more fine-grained distinctions, the [sense] groups
will avail us little.”
Ides and Wilks (2007) drew on psycholinguistic
research to help establish an appropriate level of
sense granularity. However, there is no consensus
in the psycholinguistics field on how lexical mean-
ing is represented in the mind (Klein &amp; Murphy,
2001; Pylkkänen et al., 2006; Rodd et al., 2002),
and, as the Ide and Wilks (2007) state, “research in
this area has been focused on developing psycho-
logical models of language processing and has not
directly addressed the problem of identifying
senses that are distinct enough to warrant, in psy-
chological terms, a separate representation in the
mental lexicon.”
Our experiment looked directly at sense distinc-
tions of varying degrees of meaning relatedness
and found indications that the mental lexicon does
not consist of separate representations of discrete
senses for each word. Rather, word senses may
share a greater or smaller portion of a semantic
representation depending on the how closely re-
lated the senses are. Because closely related senses
may share a large portion of their semantic repre-
sentation, clustering such senses together would
result in very little meaning loss. The remainder of
this paper will describe the experiment and its im-
plications for WSD in more detail.

2 Experiment
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999762">
The goal of this experiment was to determine
whether each sense of a word has a completely
separate mental representation or not. If so, we also
hoped to discover what types of sense distinctions
seem to have separate mental representations.

2.1 Materials
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.956315967741936">
Four groups of materials were prepared using the
fine-grained sense distinctions found in WordNet
2.1. Each group consisted of 11 pairs of phrases.
The groups comprised (1) homonymy, (2) distantly
related senses, (3) closely related senses, and (4)
same senses (see Table 1 for examples). Placement
in these groups depended both on the classification
of the usages by WordNet and the Oxford English
Dictionary and on the ratings given to pairs of
phrases by a group of undergraduates. They rated
the relatedness of the verb in each pair on a scale
of 0 to 3, with 0 being completely unrelated and 3
being the same sense.
A pair was considered to represent the same
sense if the usage of the verb in both phrases was
categorized by WordNet as the same and if the pair
received a rating greater than 2.7. Closely related
senses were listed as separate senses by WordNet
and received a rating between 1.8 and 2.5. Distant-
ly related senses were listed as separate senses by
WordNet and received ratings between 0.7 and 1.3.
Because WordNet makes no distinction between
related and unrelated senses, the Oxford English
Dictionary was used to classify homonyms. Ho-
monyms were listed as such by the OED and re-
ceived ratings under 0.3.

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999990909090909">
The experiment used a semantic decision task
(Klein &amp; Murphy, 2001; Pylkkänen et al., 2006), in
which people were asked to judge whether short
phrases “made sense” or not. Subjects saw a
phrase, such as “posted the guard,” and would de-
cide whether the phrase made sense as quickly and
as accurately as possible. They would then see
another phrase with the same verb, such as “posted
the letter,” and respond to that phrase as well. The
response time and accuracy were recorded for the
second phrase of each pair.

sense pairs and different sense pairs (a combina-

tion of closely related, distantly related, and unre-
lated senses), we found a reliable difference (same
sense mean: 1056ms, different sense mean:
1272ms; t32 =6.33; p&lt;.0001). We also found better
accuracy for same sense pairs (same sense: 95.6%
correct vs. different sense: 78% correct; t32=7.49;
p&lt;.0001). When moving from one phrase to another
with the same meaning, subjects were faster and
more accurate than when moving to a phrase with
a different sense of the verb.
By itself, this result would fit with the theory that
every sense of a word has a separate semantic re-
presentation. One would expect people to access
the meaning of a verb quickly if they had just seen
the verb used with that same meaning. One could
think of the meaning as already having been “acti-
vated” by the first phrase. Accessing a completely
different semantic representation when moving
from one sense to another should be slower.
If all senses have separate representations, access
to meaning should proceed in the same way for all.
For example, if one is primed with the phrase
“fixed the radio,” response time and accuracy
should be the same whether the target is “fixed the
vase” or “fixed the date.” Instead, we found a sig-
nificant difference between these two groups, with
closely related pairs accessed, on average, 173ms
more quickly than the mean of the distantly and
unrelated pairs (t32=5.85; p&lt;.0005), and accuracy was
higher (91% vs. 72%; t32=8.65; p&lt;.0001).
A distinction between distantly related pairs and
homonyms was found as well. Response times for
distantly related pairs was faster than for homo-
nyms (distantly related mean: 1253ms, homonym
mean: 1406ms; t32=2.38; p&lt;.0001). Accuracy was en-
hanced as well for this group (distantly related
mean: 81%, unrelated mean: 62%; t32=5.66; p&lt;.0001).
Related meanings, even distantly related, seem to
be easier to access than unrelated meanings.

A final planned comparison tested for a linear
progression through the test conditions. Although
somewhat redundant with the other comparisons,
this test did reveal a highly significant linear pro-
gression for response time (F1,32=95.8; p&lt;.0001)
and for accuracy (F1,32=100.1; p&lt;.0001).
People have an increasingly difficult time ac-
cessing the meaning of a word as the relatedness of
the meaning in the first phrase grows more distant.
They respond more slowly and their accuracy de-
clines. However, closely related senses are almost
as easy to access as same sense phrases. These re-
sults suggest that closely related word senses may
be represented in the mental lexicon much like a
single sense, perhaps sharing a core semantic re-
presentation.
The linear progression through meaning related-
ness is also compatible with a theory in which the
semantic representations of related senses overlap.
Rather than being discrete entities attached to a
main “entry”, they could share a general semantic
space. Various portions of the space could be acti-
vated depending on the context in which the word
occurs. This structure allows for more coarse-
grained or more fine-grained distinctions to be
made, depending on the needs of the moment.
A structure in which the semantic representations
overlap allows for the apparently smooth progres-
sion from same sense usages to more and more
distantly related usages. It also provides a simple
explanation for semantically underdetermined
usages of a word. Although separate senses of a
word can be identified in different contexts, in
some contexts, both senses (or a vague meaning
indeterminate between the two) seem to be
represented by the same word. For example,
“newspaper” can refer to a physical object: “He
tore the newspaper in half”, or to the content of a
publication: “The newspaper made me mad today,
suggesting that our committee is corrupt.” The sen-

3 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99997487804878">
What does this mean for WSD? Most would
agree that NLP applications would benefit from the
ability to distinguish homonym-level meaning dif-
ferences. Similarly, most would agree that it is not
necessary to make very fine distinctions, even if
we can describe them. For example, the process of
cleaning a cup is discernibly different from the
process of cleaning a shirt, yet we would not want
to have a WSD system try to distinguish between
every minor variation on cleaning. The problem
comes with deciding when meanings can be consi-
dered the same sense, and when they should be
considered different.
The results of this study suggest that some word
usages considered different by WordNet provoke
similar responses as those to same sense usages. If
these usages activate the same or largely overlap-
ping meaning representations, it seems safe to as-
sume that little meaning loss would result from
clustering these closely related senses into one
more general sense. Conversely, people reacted to
distantly related senses much as they did to homo-
nyms, suggesting that making distinctions between
these usages would be useful in a WSD system.
A closer analysis of the study materials reveals
differences between the types of distinctions made
in the closely related senses and the types made in
the distantly related senses. Most of the closely
related senses distinguished between different con-
crete usages, whereas the distantly related senses
distinguished between a concrete usage and a fi-
gurative or metaphorical usage. This suggests that
grouping concrete usages together may result in
little, if any, meaning loss. It may be more impor-
tant to keep concrete senses distinct from figura-
tive or metaphorical senses. The present study,
however, divided senses only on degree of related-
ness rather than type of relatedness. It would be
useful in future studies to address more directly the
question of distinctions based on concreteness,
animacy, agency, and so on.

For example, “newspaper” can refer to a physical object: “He tore the newspaper in half”, or to the content of a publication: “The newspaper made me mad today, that our committee is corrupt.” The sen- 251 tence “I really like this newspaper” makes no commitment to either sense. . 3 Conclusions What does this mean for WSD? Most would agree that NLP applications would benefit from the ability to distinguish homonym-level meaning differences. Similarly, most would agree that it is not necessary to make very fine distinctions, even if we can describe them. For example, the process of cleaning a cup is discernibly different from the process of cleaning a shirt, yet we would not want to have a WSD system try to distinguish between every minor variation on cleaning. The problem comes with deciding when meanings can be considered the same sense, and when they should be considered different. The results of this study suggest that some word usages considered different by WordNet provoke similar responses as those to same sense usages. If these usages activate the same or largely overlapping meaning representations, it seems safe to assume that little meaning loss would result from clustering these closely related senses into one more general sense. Conversely, people reacted to distantly related senses much as they did to homonyms, suggesting that making distinctions between these usages would be useful in a WSD system. A closer analysis of the study materials reveals differences between the types of distinctions made in the closely related senses and the types made in the distantly related senses. Most of the closely related senses distinguished between different concrete usages, whereas the distantly related senses distinguished between a concrete usage and a figurative or metaphorical usage. This suggests that grouping concrete usages together may result in little, if any, meaning loss. It may be more important to keep concrete senses distinct from figurative or metaphorical senses. The present study, however, divided senses only on degree of relatedness rather than type of relatedness. It would be useful in future studies to address more directly the question of distinctions based on concreteness, animacy, agency, and so on.</abstract>

Rather than having a finite list of senses, many words seem to have senses that shade from one into another. One could assume that dictionaries make broadly similar divisions and the exact point of division is only a minor detail. Simply picking one resource and sticking with it should solve the problem. In fact, WordNet, with its broad coverage and easy accessibility, has become the resource of choice for WSD. However, some have questioned whether WordNet’s fine-grained sense distinctions are appropriate for the task (Ide &amp; Wilks, 2007; Palmer et al., 2007). Some are concerned about feasibility: Is WSD at this level an unattainable goal? Others with practicality: Is this level of detail really needed for most NLP tasks, such as machine translation or question-answering? Finally, some wonder whether such fine-grained distinctions even reflect how human beings represent word meaning. Human annotators have trouble distinguishing such fine-grained senses reliably. Interannotator agreement with WordNet senses is around 70% (Snyder &amp; Palmer, 2004; Chklovski &amp; Mihalcea, 2002), and it’s understandable that WSD systems would have di</context>

The default choice has been WordNet, with its broad coverage and easy accessibility. However, concerns have been raised about the appropriateness of its fine-grained word senses for WSD. WSD systems have been far more successful in distinguishing coarsegrained senses than fine-grained ones (Navigli, 2006), but does that approach neglect necessary meaning differences? Recent psycholinguistic evidence seems to indicate that closely related word senses may be represented in the mental lexicon much like a single sense, whereas distantly related senses may be represented more like discrete entities. These results suggest that, for the purposes of WSD, closely related word senses can be clustered together into a more general sense with little meaning loss. The current paper will describe this psycholinguistic research and its implications for automatic word sense disambiguation. 1 Introduction* The </context>
