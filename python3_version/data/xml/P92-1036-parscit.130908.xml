INTRODUCTION

<bodyText confidence="0.988512944444444">
It has been widely assumed that VP ellipsis is gov-
erned by an identity condition: the elided VP is in-
terpreted as an identical copy of another expression
in surrounding discourse. For example, Sag (76)
imposes an identity condition on Logical Form rep-
resentations of VP&apos;s. A basic feature of this ac-
count is the requirement that a syntactic VP be
available as the antecedent. This requirement is re-
flected in most subsequent accounts as well. In this
paper I examine three cases of VP ellipsis in which
the antecedent cannot be identified with any VP.
These cases, which are illustrated using naturally-
occurring examples, present a fundamental problem
for any of the standard approaches. I will argue
that they receive a natural treatment in the system
I have developed, in which VP ellipsis is treated by
storing VP meanings in a discourse model.
I will address the following three problems:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.955766625">
• Combined Antecedents: The antecedent may be a
combination of more than one previous property.
• Passive Antecedents: the antecedent in a passive
clause may not be associated with any VP, but,
rather, the property associated with the active
counterpart of that clause.
• NP Antecedents: the antecedent may be a prop-
erty associated with an NP.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.997253">
In what follows, I sketch my general approach
to VP ellipsis, after which I show how each of the
above phenomena can be treated in this approach.

BACKGROUND
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99960137037037">
VP ellipsis, I suggest, is to be explained along the
lines of familiar accounts of pronominal anaphora
(e.g., Kamp 80, Heim 81). A discourse model is
posited, containing various semantic objects, includ-
ing (among other things) entities and properties
that have been evoked in preceding discourse. Typ-
ically, entities are evoked by NP&apos;s, and properties
by VP&apos;s. The interpretation of a pronoun involves a
selection among the entities stored in the discourse
model. Similarly, the interpretation of an elliptical
VP involves a selection among the properties stored
in the discourse mode1.1 I have described an imple-
mentation along these lines in Hardt 91, based on
some extensions to the Incremental Interpretation
System (Pereira and Pollack 91).
There are two rules governing VP ellipsis: one
allowing the introduction of properties into the dis-
course model, and another allowing the recovery of
properties from the discourse model.
These two rules are given below. In general, I
assume the form of grammar in Pereira and Pollack
91, in which all semantic rules take the input and
output discourse models as arguments. That is, all
semantic rules define relations on discourse models,
or &amp;quot;file change potentials&amp;quot;, in Heim&apos;s terms.
The (simplified) rule for recovering a property
from the discourse model is:
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.486933" genericHeader="method">
AUX =P
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997890428571429">
where P e DMin•
That is, an auxiliary verb is replaced by some
property P stored in the input discourse model.
Secondly, properties are introduced into the dis-
course model by the following rule:
Upon encountering a property-denoting seman-
tic object of the form:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.653363">
P(- , ai)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.958087">
that is, a predicate with the first argument slot
empty, we have:
DMout = DMin U {P(- a1)}
This indicates that the property is added to the
output discourse model. Typically, the property-
denoting expression is associated with a VP, al-
though other types of expressions can also introduce
properties into the discourse model.
I have argued elsewhere (Hardt 91, 91a) that
such a system has certain important advantages over
alternative approaches, such as those of Sag (76)
and Williams (77). 2
&apos;To be precise, it is not properties that are stored as
VPE antecedents, but relations involving an input and
output discourse context as well as a property.

In what follows, I will briefly examine the phe-
nomena listed above, which present fundamental
problems for all accounts of VP ellipsis of which
I am aware3. For each problem, I will suggest that
the current approach provides a solution.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.966371" genericHeader="method">
COMBINED ANTECEDENTS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.989840333333333">
There are cases of VP ellipsis in which the an-
tecedent is combined from two or more separate
VP&apos;s. This presents a problem for most accounts of
VP ellipsis, since there is no syntactic object con-
sisting of the combination of two separate VP&apos;s. If
antecedents are stored in the discourse model, as I
am suggesting, this is not surprising. For example,
it is well known that combinations of entities can be-
come the antecedent for a plural pronoun. Consider
the following example:
After the symmetry between left-handed
particles and right-handed anti- particles was
broken by the ka,ons in the 1960s, a new symme-
try was introduced which everybody swears is
unbreakable. This is between left-handed par-
ticles moving forwards in time, and right-
handed anti-particles moving backwards in
time (none do, in any practical sense, but that
does not worry theorists too much).
From: The Economist, 4 August 1990, p.69.
Bonnie Webber, P.C.
The meaning of the elided VP (&amp;quot;none do&amp;quot;) is,
I take it, &amp;quot;none do move forwards or move back-
wards in time&amp;quot;. So the antecedent must consists of a
combination of properties associated with two VP&apos;s:
&amp;quot;moving forwards in time&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;moving backwards
in time&amp;quot;.
Such an example indicates the necessity for a
rule allowing the set of properties in the discourse
model to be expanded, as follows:
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.569245" genericHeader="method">
{P...Q...} {P...Q...[P OP Q]}
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.991114454545455">
That is, if the discourse model contains two
properties P and Q, it may also contain the property
resulting from a combination of P and Q by some
operator (I assume that the operators include AND
and OR).
Another example is the following:
So I say to the conspiracy fans: leave him
alone. Leave us alone. But they won&apos;t.
From: The Welcomat, 5 Feb 92, p.25
Here the meaning of the elliptical VP is: &amp;quot;they
won&apos;t leave him alone or leave us alone&amp;quot;.
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.600803">
plicates the Sag/Williams approach in DRT. Of partic-
ular relevance here is Klein&apos;s requirement that the an-
tecedent be a DRT-representation of a syntactic VP.
3The recent account of Dalrymple, Shieber and
Pereira (91) does treat the &amp;quot;Passive Antecedent&amp;quot; prob-
lem. However, no treatment of the &amp;quot;Combined An-
tecedent&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;NP Antecedent&amp;quot; problems is given.
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.998292352941177">
This phenomenon has been noted in the liter-
ature, in particular by Webber (78), in which the
following examples were given:
I can walk, and I can chew gum. Gerry
can too, but not at the same time.
Wendy is eager to sail around the world
and Bruce is eager to climb Kilimanjaro, but
neither of them can because money is too tight.
By the rule given above, this example could be
given the interpretation &amp;quot;neither of them can sail
around the world or climb Kilimanjaro&amp;quot;.
It is clear that the combining operation is highly
constrained. In all the examples mentioned, either
P and Q have the same subject, or the subject of
the elliptical VP refers to the two subjects of P and
Q. In future work, I will attempt to formulate con-
straints on this operation.

<sectionHeader confidence="0.971195" genericHeader="method">
PASSIVE ANTECEDENTS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.988683351351352">
The next problem is illustrated by the following
example, cited by Dalrymple, Shieber and Pereira
(91):
A lot of this material can be presented in a
fairly informal and accessible fashion, and often
I do.
From: Noam Chomsky on the Generative En-
terprise, Foris Publications, Dordrecht. 1982.
The antecedent for the elliptical VP is &amp;quot;present
a lot of this material in a fairly informal and acces-
sible fashion&amp;quot;. This is not associated with a VP, al-
though the active counterpart of the sentence would
contain such a VP. This is not surprising from a se-
mantic point of view, since it is traditionally held
that a &apos;passive transformation&apos; preserves semantic
equivalence.
Another example of this is following:
Business has to be developed and de-
fended differently than we have in the past.
From: NPR interview, 24 May 91
The most straightforward treatment of such
phenomena in the current framework is to assume
that the syntactic derivation of a passive antecedent
such as &amp;quot;this material can be presented&amp;quot; corre-
sponds to a semantic object
present(_, this material)
More generally, for a syntactic expression
SUBJ be VP+en
the corresponding semantic object is
VP&apos;(—, SUBJ&apos;)
That is, the denotation of the &amp;quot;surface subject&amp;quot;
becomes the second argument of the VP-denotation.
This semantic object, then, satisfies the condition
on the rule for introducing properties given above.
Thus, under such a treatment of the passive, these
examples are accommodated in the present system
without further stipulations.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.888862" genericHeader="method">
NP ANTECEDENTS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.974053">
In many cases, the antecedent property is intro-
duced by a NP rather than a VP. This would be
difficult to explain for a syntactic or logical form
theory. From a semantic point of view, it is not sur-
prising, since many NP&apos;s contain a common noun
which is standardly analyzed semantically as denot-
ing a property. Consider the following (naturally
occurring) example:
We should suggest to her that she officially
appoint us as a committee and invite fac-
ulty participation/input. They won&apos;t, of
course,...
From: email message. (Bonnie Webber, p.c.)
In this example, the meaning of the elided VP
is &amp;quot;they won&apos;t participate&amp;quot;. The source is the NP
&amp;quot;faculty participation&amp;quot;.
Another example is the following:
[Many Chicago-area cabdrivers] say their
business is foundering because the riders they
depend on — business people, downtown work-
ers and the elderly — are opting for the bus and
the elevated train, or are on the unemployment
line. Meanwhile, they sense a drop in visitors
to the city. Those who do, they say, are not
taking cabs.
From: Chicago Tribune front page, 2/6/92.
Gregory Ward, p.c.
Here, the meaning of the elided VP is &amp;quot;those
who do visit&amp;quot;, where the source is the NP &amp;quot;visitors&amp;quot;.
In the current framework, such examples could
be treated as follows. Assume, following Chierchia
(84), that there is a class of nouns that are semanti-
cally correlated with properties. For any such noun,
the associated property can be added to the dis-
course model, just as is done for verbs.

CONCLUSIONS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999405">
The cases investigated constitute strong evidence
that VP ellipsis must be explained at a seman-
tic/discourse level. I have argued that the examples
can be dealt with in the system I have developed.
In future work, I will formulate constraints on the
operations described here.
