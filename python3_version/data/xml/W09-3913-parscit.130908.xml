Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999976333333333">
Demonstrative terms are highly context-
dependent elements both in deictic and
anaphoric uses. When reference is
transferred from a visual, three-
dimensional context to the textual
domain, information-structure factors
(i.e. the cognitive status of the
antecedent, recency of mention, syntactic
structure or the semantic type of the
antecedent) have an effect on speaker
preferences for selecting demonstrative
anaphors over other referring expres-
sions. In certain languages, there seems
to be a correlation between demonstra-
tives and tenses in discourse. For ex-
ample, proximal demonstratives correlate
better with present tenses whereas distal
demonstratives correlate with past tenses.
In this paper, we present a corpus study
of Spanish texts that analyzes the ways in
which temporal expressions selectively
favor the use of specific demonstratives
thus confirming the contextual
dependency of demonstrative anaphors.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999970773584906">
As referring expressions, adnominal and pro-
nominal demonstratives (this/that) can be used in
two basic ‘modes’ that allow speakers to refer to
entities in different discourse situations. In the
deictic mode, speakers commonly use
demonstratives to refer to physical, concrete
entities in the real-world speech situation. Utter-
ance of the demonstrative (very likely accompa-
nied by a pointing gesture) has an important
communicative effect, namely, that of focusing
the attention of the addressee on a particular
entity in the perceptual or visual field. This is
accomplished by making the intended entity
salient from among a set of (potentially)
competing entities. Thus, both speaker and
addressee focus their attention on the same
element and the speaker’s intended
communicative goal is achieved. This is the so-
called joint attention effect in the
psycholinguistics literature (Diessel 2006) In
these exophoric uses, the role of the pointing
gesture (a pointing finger, a gaze or movement
of the head) may become essential. It completes
the meaning of the demonstrative expression and
serves to disambiguate the speaker’s reference.
Demonstratives can also be used exophorically
without an accompanying ostension, but in such
cases the entity referred to is already sufficiently
salient in the visual field for the interlocutors to
have focused their attention on it and,
consequently, an accompanying gesture by the
speaker would be redundant or irrelevant to
achieve the intended communicative goal.
There are certain uses of demonstrative ele-
ments that depart from the purely deictic mode.
These uses, long and widely recognized, have
been characterized as anaphoric or discourse
anaphoric many authors (see inter alia Asher,
1993; Diessel, 1999; Janssen, 1996; Gundel et al.
2001, 2003; Hegarty et al. 2001). Thus, as de-
monstrative anaphors, demonstratives like En-
glish this/that are coreferential with a range of
textual elements. From a syntactic point of view,
the antecedents of demonstrative anaphors can
be of a varied nature: NPs, subordinate clauses,
entire sentences or larger textual fragments.
Semantically, these antecedents comprise a rich
ontology that ranges from individuals or
propositions to event and event-types. Whether
the anaphoric referring mode is derived from a
primary deictic character or not is an issue quite
beyond the purpose of this paper, but studies on
language acquisition indicate that the deictic

features are learned at the earlier stages (Diessel
2006).
The only difference between the referential
capabilities of deictic and anaphoric uses of
demonstratives lies in the fact that these
capabilities have been transferred from a real-
world context of utterance common to strict
deictic uses to a textual (endophoric) domain in
the anaphoric use. The communicative function
remains the same. The pointing gesture, absent
in demonstrative anaphors, seems to have
evolved into derived pragmatic functions in the
anaphoric use. A key feature that is common to
both deictic and anaphoric uses is their high
degree of contextual dependency. This issue will
be explored in the next sections.

In deictic uses, pronominal and adnominal
demonstratives are highly context dependent. In
order to be properly used and fully interpreted,
they require the aid of contextual parameters
such as the speaker, the addressee, the location
of the deictic center, the location of the object
pointed at, the utterance time, etc. This is not
only true of demonstratives like this (NP) or that
(NP) but also of other indexical expressions like
here, there, I, you, etc.
Demonstrative anaphors also appear to be de-
pendent on contextual factors to a high degree.
The most relevant parameter in anaphoric uses is
textual context. Elements such as referential
distance, lexical clues, or syntactic structure may
have an effect on the speaker’s preferences for
one demonstrative over the other(s), or over
other referential expressions. For example,
Gundel et al (2001, 2003) examined referential
expressions, including demonstratives and the
personal pronoun it, in different environments
and came to the conclusion that several factors,
most prominently information structure, have an
effect in the way clausally-introduced entities are
referred to with these expressions. Different
referential expressions (demonstratives, indefi-
nites, the definite article, etc.) have the property
of ‘marking’ the cognitive status of their antece-
dents. In the Givenness Hierarchy (Gundel et al.
1993), the antecedents of demonstratives are
cognitively ACTIVATED whereas those of the
unstressed personal pronoun it are IN FOCUS. As
they point out, “the entities IN FOCUS at a given
point in the discourse will be that partially-
ordered subset of activated entities which are
likely to be continued as topics of subsequent
utterances.” (2001: 40). A very important factor
in determining the status of an entity is syntactic
structure. Consider the following discourses:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.996114125">
(1) a. My neighbor ‘s Bull Mastiff bit a girl on
a bike.
b. It’s/That’s the same dog that bit Mary
last summer.
(2) a. Sears delivered new siding to my
neighbors with the Bull Mastiff.
b. #It’s/That’s the same dog that bit Mary
last summer.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997788">
In (1)1, the NP My neighbor’s Bull Mastiff
occupies the subject position of a main clause
and it is very likely the discourse topic. This
brings the entity into the FOCUS of attention and,
therefore, can be indistinctively referred to using
personal and demonstrative pronouns. The
anaphor ‘that’ can be used to refer to the NP for
entities IN FOCUS are also ACTIVATED, namely,
in working memory. On the other hand, entities
introduced in subordinate clauses or preposi-
tional phrases are more likely to be rendered the
cognitive status ACTIVATED upon their intro-
duction in discourse. This point is shown in
example (2), where the same NP is introduced
within a prepositional phrase. This peripheral
syntactic position renders the cognitive status of
the antecedent ACTIVATED hence banning the
use of the personal pronoun it and licensing the
use of the demonstrative pronoun.
Another contextual factor that has been inves-
tigated as bearing clear implications on the use
of demonstrative anaphors by language users is
referential distance. By referential distance we
mean the textual distance between the antecedent
and the demonstrative anaphor. Textual or
referential distance is commonly quantified as
the number of intervening clauses between
antecedent and anaphor. Hegarty et al. (2000)
observed that English demonstrative pronouns
and adjectives (this/that-(NP)) show a strong
preference for their antecedents to be found in
the clause immediately preceding the clause
holding the demonstrative expression.
In quite the same line, Kirsner et al. (1987)
investigate the factors that affect demonstrative
(deze ‘this’ vs die ‘that’) choice in written
Dutch. One of these determining factors is the
magnitude of referential distance. Based on texts
from different subcorpora tested on native Dutch
speakers and comprising various different dis-

course genres, these authors showed that the
Dutch proximal demonstrative deze (‘this’) tends
to be associated with referential distance ≥ 1
(extrasentential retrieval of a referent) and distal
die (‘that’) tends to be associated with referential
distance = 0 (intrasentential retrieval of a refer-
ent). Their study showed that only 15% of NPs
with deze (‘this’) have referential distance = 0,
whereas a 40% of the NPs with die (‘that’) have
referential distance = 0.
In our empirical corpus study, we have
analyzed the referential distance factor for
Spanish demonstrative pronouns with the aim of
checking whether this contextual parameter may
have an influence on the speakers’ preferences
for one demonstrative over the others. Let us
first briefly characterize Spanish demonstratives.
Unlike English, Spanish has a tripartite
demonstrative system with three elements (este,
ese and aquel) inflected for gender and number.
As deictic elements, these demonstratives are
commonly characterized as conveying different
degrees of distance with respect to the deictic
center (the speaker): este (‘this’) is proximal, ese
(‘that’) medial, and aquel (‘that yonder’) is the
distal demonstrative of the tripartite system. In
addition, Spanish has three demonstrative
pronouns (esto, eso and aquello), which do not
inflect and have been traditionally labelled as
neuter demonstrative pronouns in the Spanish
grammatical tradition (even though there is not
clearly a neuter grammatical gender in this
language). Most likely these pronouns have been
labelled as neuter for they are used, as in many
other languages, as demonstrative anaphors to
anaphorically and cataphorically refer to
abstract, genderless, higher order entities like
events, propositions, etc. in discourse.

Actual) has been the source of data used throughout this
paper and for all our corpus samples and illustrative
examples. The CREA corpus of Spanish is a very large
collection of texts. A dedicated search interface allows the
user to search the corpus for words and phrases and display
the search result as a concordance with limited context (the
sufficient amount of context for the purposes of this paper.)
The corpus comprises written texts (newspaper, novels,
emails, etc.) as well as transcribed spoken discourse
(interviews, speeches, etc.). For the purposes of this paper,
we have included both written and spoken discourse in our
corpus samples. The corpus is accessible at

neuter demonstrative pronouns. To this aim, we
obtained a sample of 193 cases to be scrutinized.
Out of the total 193 occurrences, 82 were
instances of demonstrative esto, 80 instances of
eso and 31 of aquello. In order to restrict the
high number of occurrences of demonstratives in
our corpus we searched for combinations of a
demonstrative in the subject position
immediately followed by a past tense (e.g. esto
ocurri—... (‘this happened...’). The sample is not
even (82 vs 80 vs 31 cases) due to the lesser
frequency of occurrence of demonstrative
aquello in Spanish oral and written discourses.
In order to find out the antecedent (and se-
mantic referent) of the demonstrative, we seg-
mented our sample texts into sentences as in (3).
Note that each bracketed item corresponds to a
discourse segment (a sentence), and each
segment has been numbered with a subscript.
The demonstrative anaphor is written in bold
characters and the most likely antecedent has
been underlined. In (3), for example, the
antecedent to the demonstrative pronoun can be
found in sentence #3 (subscript CL3), namely, in
the third sentence relative to the position of the
demonstrative anaphor in clause CL0.
Antecedent and anaphor are subscripted to show
coreference. An English translation of the
original Spanish text is given below.

The results from our study indicate that demon-
strative pronouns in Spanish show, like English,
a strong preference for their antecedents to be
found immediately prior to the occurrence of the
anaphor. The results are shown in Figure 1.
There are 7 different categories. Categories la-
belled 1CL, 2CL, 3CL and 4CL stand for the

sentence ID number where the antecedent was
found (where 1CL is the closest to the anaphor).
The category ≥5CL comprises all those cases in
which the antecedent was found in the fifth
clause preceding the anaphor and up. All those
cases in which, for some reason, the proper
antecedent could not be determined have been
gathered under category N/A (e.g. not enough
text to locate the antecedent, the antecedent was
ambiguous, etc.). Finally, the category labelled
CATAPH stands for cases of cataphora where
reference via the demonstrative is made to a
textual entity, which is subsequent to the ap-
pearance of the anaphor. In all instances of cata-
phoric reference considered, the antecedent was
found in the clause immediately following the
one holding the anaphor.

The results seem to be relatively straightforward:
in 123 instances (63.7%) out of the total 193
cases examined, the antecedent was found in the
sentence closest to the anaphor (1CL). This
percentage increases substantially up to a 77.8%
when we leave N/A cases out of the count. On
the other hand, there are no relevant differences
regarding individual demonstrative pronouns as
the three elements obtained pretty similar results:
78% of antecedents of proximal esto (‘this’),
78.2% of eso (‘that’) and 76.0% of aquello (‘that
yonder’) were found in 1CL. Even if we would
collapse categories 2CL, 3CL, 4CL and ≥5CL
into one single category (with label ≥2CL), the
number of antecedents found in the clause
closest to the demonstrative anaphor would still
be much higher. The results of this study seem to
confirm the data by Hegarty et al. (2000) for
English, namely that demonstrative pronouns
show a strong preference for their clausal
antecedents to be introduced in the sentence
preceding the one containing the anaphor.
Unlike Dutch demonstratives deze and die
(Kirsner et al. (1987), Spanish demonstrative
pronouns do not exhibit any individual
differences concerning referential distance. This
does not entail that Spanish demonstratives do
not show any semantic or pragmatic differences.
As we will see in the next section, Spanish
demonstratives show important differences in
the way they are licensed in discourse by certain
contextual elements like tenses, even denoting
nominals and temporal adverbials.

3 Tense and demonstration in discourse
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99966817948718">
In the Spanish grammatical tradition, it was
noticed that demonstratives and some particular
tenses show a correlation in oral and written
discourse (Fern‡ndez-Ram’rez, 1951; cf. also
Guti6rrez-Rexach (2002) for a more recent
restatement). This parallelism arises when
demonstratives are used as discourse anaphors,
that is, when reference is intratextual. To date,
the alleged correlation tense-demonstration has
not been empirically tested. To this aim, we
carried out a corpus study to check whether the
alleged correlation can be sustained and
explained.
The alleged correlation tense-demonstration
does not appear to be restricted to Spanish. In
Dutch, Kirsner et al. (1987) studied the effect
than tense may have on the speaker’s choice of
demonstratives deze (‘this’) and die (‘that’). At
the intrasentential level, they found that 59% of
present tense verb forms co-occur with proximal
deze and 67% of past tense forms co-occur with
distal die. These figures are based on the study
of 43-deze sentences and 42 die-sentences
containing non-perfect verb forms. Nevertheless,
as the authors of the study point out, when con-
text is added, other factors such as referential
distance, the degree of detail with which the
referent has been described, etc. override the
influence of tense on demonstrative choice. It is
worth noting that for Kirsner et al.’s the differ-
ences in meaning between Dutch demonstratives
can be fundamentally explained on the basis of
“the degree of attention which the addressee is
instructed to give to the referent of the noun” (p.
17).
Regarding Spanish, our initial hypothesis is
that contextual clues or elements such as tense,
temporal adverbials, event denoting nominals
and other temporal expressions favor the use of
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.964404">
100
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999964216216216">
certain demonstrative anaphors. In particular, we
will hypothesize that distal demonstrative aquel
(‘that yonder’), both in its pronominal and
adnominal forms, needs a PAST-denoting
contextual element to be licensed in discourse.
As a consequence, anaphoric reference with the
distal demonstrative aquel commonly involves
past events, facts, situations, etc. On the other
hand, the two other demonstratives of the
tripartite system (proximal este (‘this’) and
medial ese (‘that’)) do not need any particular
contextual configuration to be used as
demonstrative anaphors in discourse. In sum,
there is a correlation between a PAST trigger and
distal aquel, whereas este and ese are found in
any context irrespective of their temporal frame
in discourse.
We carried out a second corpus study where
we analyzed if the alleged correlation tense-
demonstration can be sustained on empirical
grounds. For this purpose, we searched for oc-
currences of demonstrative pronouns and past
and present tense verb forms where the demon-
strative anaphor played the syntactic role of
subject of the verb. A sample query is shown in
(4). All three demonstrative pronouns were
combined with the tensed verb forms: past tense
as in (4a) and present tense as in (4b). We lim-
ited our search to event predicates (‘happen’,
‘occur’ and ‘finish’), to ensure the demonstra-
tives in question were referring back in the text
to events, which are entities that are commonly
referred to via demonstrative anaphors. At the
same time, forcing a discourse referential read-
ing for the demonstrative would ensure that we
were filtering out other actual uses of Spanish
demonstratives as discourse particles.

3. As shown in the chart in 2, only 1 single
occurrence of demonstrative aquello combined
with a present tense was found. Compare these
figures with the 573 occurrences of
demonstrative pronoun esto and 209 occurrences
of ‘medial’ demonstrative eso.

Figure 2: total number of demonstrative plus pre-
sent tense combinations found in corpus search.

<bodyText confidence="0.98636184375">
On the other hand, the frequency of tokens of
demonstrative aquello accompanied by a past
tensed verb form increases dramatically as
shown in graph 3 (45 occurrences). Thus, out of
the total 46 tokens of demonstrative aquello
found in our corpus search, only 2.17% were
cases where the demonstrative was accompanied
by a past tense. The other two demonstratives
also show a high rate of occurrence along with
past tenses in discourse (151 tokens of eso vs
290 of proximal esto).
The disparity in the total number of
occurrences among demonstratives (46 of distal
aquello; 360 of medial eso; 863 of proximal
esto) clearly indicates that the use of
demonstrative aquel is in general quite limited in
modern Spanish; especially when compared to
the overall frequency of use of demonstratives
este and ese. This is a proven fact that equally
applies to pronominal and adnominal
demonstrative aquel when used anaphorically in
discourse.
4 Some of these tenses do not have a direct or exact
correspondence in English, while others do. Thus, for
example, the Spanish “pret&amp;ito perfecto” is quite similar to
the present perfect tense in English. While technically a
past tense, Spanish pret6rito perfecto is commonly
characterized as having current relevance (i.e. the event
conveyed by the tensed verb is relevant at a time that
extends into or overlaps the speech time). For this reason
we decided to include this tense in the group of PRESENT
tenses.

<bodyText confidence="0.999894318181818">
The numbers shown in figures 2 and 3 indi-
cate that the use of Spanish distal demonstrative
aquello clearly correlates with past tense in
discourse, whereas proximal esto and medial eso
co-occur with past and present tenses in a similar
proportion. Proximal demonstrative pronoun
esto is the element of the tripartite system
preferred by speakers for reference to events in
discourse. Nevertheless, the picture is not as
straightforward as it may appear from these
figures. A non systematic look at the corpus
reveals abundant cases of demonstrative aquel
used in discourse along with a past tense in its
immediate textual surroundings. A suitable
explanation must be provided for these cases or,
otherwise, the validity of our study could be
questioned and the hypothesized correlation
tense-demonstration in Spanish could not be
sustained.
In order to test whether the semantic nature of
the entity referred to or the specific demonstra-
tive expression (pronominal vs adnominal) may
have an effect on the clear correlation tense-
demonstration shown by demonstrative aquel,
we carried out a second corpus study. In this
case, we have searched the corpus for occur-
rences of the expression aquel hecho ‘that fact’
containing the demonstrative in an adnominal
use (this/that-NP type). The main goal is to test
whether other explicit contextual factors besides
tense may have an influence in the licensing of
demonstrative aquello. We looked at a
substantial fragment of text surrounding the
demonstrative anaphor (a discourse fragment
consisting of an average of 10 sentences). In all,
30 occurrences of the expression aquel hecho
(‘that fact’) were scrutinized. The results are
given in figure 4. The category acronyms stand
for the following elements: NAPT (No Apparent
Past Trigger), OTHER, EDN (Event denoting
Noun), TE (Temporal Expression), PTPC (Past
Tense(s) in Previous Clause(s), PTSC (Past Tense
in the Same Clause as the demonstrative
anaphor).

</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.999916085714286">
As figure 4 indicates, in only 3 out of the total
30 tokens analyzed no past temporal expression
could be found in the immediate discourse
context of the demonstrative anaphor. In all
other tokens, at least one past expression
‘trigger’ could be found. In many cases, more
than one past expression co-appeared in the
anaphor’s immediate context. A series of
examples are given in the appendix to this paper.
What all the linguistic expressions included in
these categories have in common is that they di-
rectly or indirectly denote a past time or, in other
words, contribute to situate the event referred to
at some interval preceding the speech time.
Taking discourse as a coherent and fully
cohesive semantic unit, what these expressions
do is contribute to the setup and maintenance of
the temporal referential frame of discourse.
Thus, for example, past time denoting temporal
expressions (dates; time adverbs like ‘tomorrow‘
and other past time denoting expressions like
‘John visited Paris last year’) are found in 14 out
of the 30 cases analyzed. Some event-denoting
nominals like, for example, the Beijing Olympic
Games or the murder of President Kennedy may
also situate the event they denote at a particular
past interval, namely, the summer of year 2008
and year 1963, respectively. Of course, nothing
in the morphology or the semantics of these
nominals indicates obligatory reference to a past
time. Rather, their interpretation as past event-
denoting nominals is clearly dependent on the
background knowledge of the conversation
participants. Thus, if we assume that common
ground and a certain amount of shared world
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.997845">
102
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999793375">
knowledge is essential to communication, event-
denoting nominals also contribute to the setup of
the referential temporal frame of discourse.
Finally, tense is another key contextual factor
that contributes to the setup and maintenance of
the temporal frame. In 13 of the tokens
examined, a past tense could be found in the
same clause as the demonstrative. In 21 cases,
the past tense verb form(s) was found in the
preceding discourse. For example, a good
number of the instances analyzed were narratives
where a certain past fact, event or action was
described using a series of past tenses along a
variable textual span.
In principle, what all these elements (past
tenses, event denoting nominals, temporal ad-
verbials) have in common is their ability to situate
the discourse entity referred to at an interval interval
preceding the actual speech time. Whether this sort
of meaning is wholly procedural or contains a
mixture of conceptual and procedural elements is
an issue that we will not discuss in this paper.
Spanish distal demonstrative aquel in discourse
anaphoric uses, and perhaps other demonstrative
anaphors in different languages, appear to be
somehow sensitive to the temporal information
conveyed by these elements up to the point that
demonstrative aquel needs a past denoting
‘trigger’ in its textual surroundings to be fully
licensed in context. As the data presented in this
paper indicate, demonstratives este and ese do
not seem to be sensitive to the past/present
distinction. This, along with other data like the
overall frequency of use of Spanish
demonstrative anaphors, can be taken as an
indication that the Spanish tripartite system is in
the process of evolving into a binary system, an
issue we will not discuss here for reasons of
space (see Guti6rrez-Rexach 2002 for a general
theory along these lines).
The fundamental conclusion that can be
drawn from this paper is that a variety of
contextual information may contribute to the
differential behavior of demonstratives as
discourse anaphors. How the particular
“licensing” of the tense-demonstration relation
in discourse takes place and how to explain
and/or characterize it is not a trivial task. Many
linguistic expressions are clearly context-
dependent in many languages in various ways. In
some cases, such dependency can be explained
on syntactic grounds (i.e. negative polarity
items). In other cases, a suitable explanation has
been provided on pragmatic or semantic grounds
(the Spanish negative word tampoco
‘neither/notÉeither’ needs either an overt
negation or even a presupposed negation in the
textual surroundings for it to be fully licensed in
discourse (Schwenter and Zulaica, 2001).
Evidence presented in this paper concerning
referential-distance preferences for Spanish
demonstrative anaphors indicate that the abstract
discourse object is commonly found in the
clause immediately preceding the anaphor. It has
also been shown that other contextual factors
need to be taken into account when dealing with
demonstrative anaphors cross-linguistically.
Thus, for example, Spanish demonstrative
anaphor aquel strongly correlates with past time
denoting expressions to the point that the
presence of any of these triggers in the
surrounding discourse context is needed for the
demonstrative to be licensed. This would seem
to indicate that demonstrative aquel also binds a
time variable thus establishing a referential
relation between the anaphor and the temporal
information conveyed by texts (along the lines
defended by Setzer and Gaizauskas, 2000; Puste-
jovsky et al. 2003; Hobbs and Pustejovsky,
2006.)

4 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999958692307693">
It is commonly assumed that demonstratives,
when used as anaphors in discourse cross-
linguistically, convey additional information
besides mere (co)-reference. For example, these
elements (and other referential expressions) are
said to mark the cognitive status of their
antecedents or contribute to the joint attentional
state of the participants in the conversation. The
source of such supplementary information
appears to be of a pragmatic nature: It arises in
specific uses and discourse context plays a
crucial role in its appearance. In this paper, we
have shown that the tripartite system of
demonstrative anaphors in Spanish seems to be
sensitive to specific temporal contextual
information. Thus, the Spanish distal
demonstrative anaphor aquel requires the
presence a past time denoting expression (i.e.
past tensed verb forms, adverbs, event-denoting
nominals and other temporal expressions) in its
contextual environment for the anaphor to be
properly used in discourse. In addition, we have
also studied the influence that referential dis-
tance may have on Spanish demonstrative ana-
phors and the speaker&apos;s preferences for one ana-
phor over the other.

Nevertheless, our empirical study is far from
being exhaustive. Future research would have to
explore other contextual factors in more detail,
such ase the amount of textual material between
the anaphor and the antecedent, the syntactic and
semantic type of specific lexical items involved,
differences among discourse genres and/or syn-
tactic prominence of the antecedent, etc. as these
factors may also help us better understand the
complex mechanisms underlying the semantics
and pragmatics of discourse anaphors.

<bodyText confidence="0.9995351">
In this appendix, we present some contextualized
examples of the Spanish distal demonstrative
aquel (‘that yonder’). The corresponding English
translation is given below each discourse sam-
ple. The demonstrative is highlighted in capital
letters for an easy identification and the source is
given in brackets at the end of every example.
Other relevant information is given in bold char-
acters. All the labels (PTPC, PTSC, EDN, TE
and Other) correspond to the corpus sample in
figure 4.
(I) This example is an instance of the
temporal trigger labeled PTPC (Past
tense(s) in previous clause(s) in our
corpus study. The text tells a brief story
about the movie Suddenly. The series of
past tensed verb forms indicate the
speaker is narrating a past event, which
is the temporal frame that triggers the
use of this particular demonstrative.

(II) The following example is ambiguous as
it may be categorized as belonging to
either category PTSC (Past tense in
same clause as anaphor) or as EDN
(Event denoting noun). On the one
hand, a past tense is accompanying the
demonstrative expression in the last
sentence. On the other hand, demonstra-
tive reference is made to the past event
denoting NP the French Revolution two
clauses before the anaphor. It appears
that this NP may be functioning as the
element that licenses the use of distal
demonstrative aquel. In cases like this,
where a clear past event denoting NP is
found, we believe the event denoting NP
prevails over any other past denoting
triggering expression. The reason behind
this is that NPs are most commonly
global or local discourse (sub)-topics. In
consequence, we labeled this particular
example as EDN.

past tenses (Spanish uses subjunctive

expression that clearly contributes to
locate the narrative at as past interval,

Therefore, the example has been catego-

OTHER in our study. It is a case of
cataphoric use of demonstrative aquel
whereby forward reference is made to an
event introduced into discourse by the

The verb form chosen to introduce this

<abstract confidence="0.99975576">Demonstrative terms are highly contextdependent elements both in deictic and anaphoric uses. When reference is transferred from a visual, threedimensional context to the textual domain, information-structure factors (i.e. the cognitive status of the antecedent, recency of mention, syntactic structure or the semantic type of the antecedent) have an effect on speaker preferences for selecting demonstrative anaphors over other referring expressions. In certain languages, there seems to be a correlation between demonstratives and tenses in discourse. For example, proximal demonstratives correlate better with present tenses whereas distal demonstratives correlate with past tenses. In this paper, we present a corpus study of Spanish texts that analyzes the ways in which temporal expressions selectively favor the use of specific demonstratives thus confirming the contextual dependency of demonstrative anaphors.</abstract>

Utterance of the demonstrative (very likely accompanied by a pointing gesture) has an important communicative effect, namely, that of focusing the attention of the addressee on a particular entity in the perceptual or visual field. This is accomplished by making the intended entity salient from among a set of (potentially) competing entities. Thus, both speaker and addressee focus their attention on the same element and the speaker’s intended communicative goal is achieved. This is the socalled joint attention effect in the psycholinguistics literature (Diessel 2006) In these exophoric uses, the role of the pointing gesture (a pointing finger, a gaze or movement of the head) may become essential. It completes the meaning of the demonstrative expression and serves to disambiguate the speaker’s reference.

For example, Gundel et al (2001, 2003) examined referential expressions, including demonstratives and the personal pronoun it, in different environments and came to the conclusion that several factors, most prominently information structure, have an effect in the way clausally-introduced entities are referred to with these expressions. Different referential expressions (demonstratives, indefinites, the definite article, etc.) have the property of ‘marking’ the cognitive status of their antecedents. In the Givenness Hierarchy (Gundel et al. 1993), the antecedents of demonstratives are cognitively ACTIVATED whereas those of the unstressed personal pronoun it are IN FOCUS. As they point out, “the entities IN FOCUS at a given point in the discourse will be that partiallyordered subset of activated entities which are likely to be continued as topics of subsequent utterances.” (2001: 40). A very important factor in determining the status of an entity is syntactic structure. Consider the following discourses: (1) a. My neighbor ‘s Bull Mastiff bit a girl on a bike. b.

These uses, long and widely recognized, have been characterized as anaphoric or discourse anaphoric many authors (see inter alia Asher, 1993; Diessel, 1999; Janssen, 1996; Gundel et al. 2001, 2003; Hegarty et al. 2001). Thus, as demonstrative anaphors, demonstratives like English this/that are coreferential with a range of textual elements. From a syntactic point of view, the antecedents of demonstrative anaphors can be of a varied nature: NPs, subordinate clauses, entire sentences or larger textual fragments.

The most relevant parameter in anaphoric uses is textual context. Elements such as referential distance, lexical clues, or syntactic structure may have an effect on the speaker’s preferences for one demonstrative over the other(s), or over other referential expressions. For example, Gundel et al (2001, 2003) examined referential expressions, including demonstratives and the personal pronoun it, in different environments and came to the conclusion that several factors, most prominently information structure, have an effect in the way clausally-introduced entities are referred to with these expressions. Different referential expressions (demonstratives, indefinites, the definite article, etc.) have the property of ‘marking’ the cognitive status of their antecedents. In the Givenness Hierarchy (Gundel et al. 1993), the antecedents of demonstratives are cognitively ACTIVATED whereas those of t</context>

(2000) observed that English demonstrative pronouns and adjectives (this/that-(NP)) show a strong preference for their antecedents to be found in the clause immediately preceding the clause holding the demonstrative expression. In quite the same line, Kirsner et al. (1987) investigate the factors that affect demonstrative (deze ‘this’ vs die ‘that’) choice in written Dutch. One of these determining factors is the magnitude of referential distance. Based on texts from different subcorpora tested on native Dutch speakers and comprising various different dis1 This example appears in Gundel et al. (2003) 98 course genres, these authors showed that the Dutch proximal demonstrative deze (‘this’) tends to be associated with referential distance ≥ 1 (extrasentential retrieval of a referent) and distal die (‘that’) tends to be associated with referential distance = 0 (intrasentential retrieval of a referent). Their study showed that only 15% of NPs with deze (‘this’) have referential distance = 0, whereas a 40% of the NPs with die (‘that’) have referential distance = 0. In our empirical corpus study, we have analyzed the referential distance factor for Spanish demonstrative pronouns with the aim o</context>

Many linguistic expressions are clearly contextdependent in many languages in various ways. In some cases, such dependency can be explained on syntactic grounds (i.e. negative polarity items). In other cases, a suitable explanation has been provided on pragmatic or semantic grounds (the Spanish negative word tampoco ‘neither/notÉeither’ needs either an overt negation or even a presupposed negation in the textual surroundings for it to be fully licensed in discourse (Schwenter and Zulaica, 2001). Evidence presented in this paper concerning referential-distance preferences for Spanish demonstrative anaphors indicate that the abstract discourse object is commonly found in the clause immediately preceding the anaphor. It has also been shown that other contextual factors need to be taken into account when dealing with demonstrative anaphors cross-linguistically.
