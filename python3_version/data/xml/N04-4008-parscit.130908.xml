<bodyText confidence="0.999849266666667">
We propose a method of automatically con-
structing an English-Chinese bilingual Fra-
meNet where the English FrameNet lexical
entries are linked to the appropriate Chinese
word senses. This resource can be used in ma-
chine translation and cross-lingual IR systems.
We coerce the English FrameNet into Chinese
using a bilingual lexicon, frame context in
FrameNet and taxonomy structure in HowNet.
Our approach does not require any manual
mapping between FrameNet and HowNet
semantic roles. Evaluation results show that
we achieve a promising 82% average F-
measure for the most ambiguous lexical
entries.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999847033898305">
Since the early 90’s, automatic alignment of bilingual
documents and sentences based on lexical and syntactic
information has been a major focus of the statistical
NLP community as their results are a valuable resource
for statistical machine translation, cross-lingual question
answering, and other bilingual or cross-lingual tasks.
Recently, there has been an increasing trend of using
semantic information for these tasks spurred by the
availability of various ontology databases such as
WordNet, FrameNet, PropBank, etc. Among these, the
Berkeley FrameNet database is a semantic lexical re-
source consisting of frame-semantic descriptions of
more than 7000 English lexical items, together with
example sentences annotated with semantic roles (Baker
et al., 1998). The current version of FrameNet has been
applied successfully to English question answering sys-
tems (Gildea, 2002). However, the manual development
of FrameNet in other languages has been on a small
scale (e.g. German, Spanish, Japanese) or unfinished
(e.g. Chinese). Since manually annotation is rather time
consuming, the main objective of our work is to auto-
matically create multilingual FrameNet to enable se-
mantic analysis in multiple languages rather than in
English. Another objective is to quantify the mapping
between semantic structures across language pairs for
statistical NLP systems. Our basic idea is to coerce the
English FrameNet into another language using existing
semantic resources and a bilingual lexicon. Our initial
target language is Chinese. However, we expect that our
technique is applicable to other languages as well. There
are two Chinese semantic resources available today--
Cilin (tong2yi4ci2ci2lin2) (Mei et al., 1982) and
HowNet (Dong and Dong, 2000). Much like WordNet,
Cilin is a thesaurus with a hierarchical structure of word
clusters, but it does not describe any semantic relation-
ship between words and categories. HowNet, on the
other hand, is an ontology with a graph structure of in-
ter-concept relations and inter-attribute relations. In
addition, HowNet has been widely used in resolving
NLP problems, such as word sense disambiguation
(Dang et al., 2002) and machine translation (Dorr et al.,
2002). For our work, we choose to align HowNet con-
cepts to lexical entries in FrameNet in order to construct
the English-Chinese bilingual FrameNet.
(Dorr et al., 2002) describes a technique for the con-
struction of a Chinese-English verb lexicon based on
HowNet and an English verb database called the LCS
Verb Database (LVD). They created links between Chi-
nese concepts in HowNet and English verb classes in
LVD using both statistics and a manually constructed
“seed mapping” of thematic classes between HowNet
and LVD. Ngai et al. (2002) employed a word-vector
based approach to create the alignment between Word-
Net and HowNet classes without any manual annotation.
In this paper, we present a fully automatic approach to
create links between FrameNet semantic frames and
HowNet concepts. We also plan to release an on-line
demonstration for the community to access the bilingual
FrameNet we built.

2 FrameNet and HowNet
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.85869772">
FrameNet and HowNet are ontologies with different
structures and different semantic role/relation defini-
tions. FrameNet is a collection of lexical entries
grouped by frame semantics. Each lexical entry repre-
sents an individual word sense, and is associated with
semantic roles and some annotated sentences. Lexical
entries with the same semantic roles are grouped into a
“frame” and the semantic roles are called “frame ele-
ments”. For example:
Frame: Cause_harm
Frame Elements: agent, body_part, cause, event, in-
strument, iterations, purpose, reason, result, victim
Lexical Entries in “cause_harm” Frame:
bash.v, batter.v, bayonet.v, beat.v, belt.v, bludgeon.v,
boil.v, break.v, bruise.v, buffet.v, burn.v,....
An annotated sentence of lexical entry “beat.v”:
[agent I] lay down on him and beat [victim at him]
[means with my fists].
HowNet is a Chinese ontology with a graph structure of
word senses called “concepts”, and each concept con-
tains 7 fields including lexical entries in Chinese, Eng-
lish gloss, POS tags for the word in Chinese and English,
and a definition of the concept including its category
and semantic relations (Dong and Dong, 2000). For
example, one translation for “beat.v” is #T:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.991034875">
NO. = 17645
W_C =#T

W_E=attack
G_E=V
E_E=
DEF=fightJ争斗
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999427333333333">
Whereas HowNet concepts correspond roughly to Fra-
meNet lexical entries, its semantic relations do not cor-
respond directly to FrameNet semantic roles.

3 Construction of the English-Chinese Bi-

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.954023653846154">
(Dorr et al. 2002) uses a manual seed mapping of se-
mantic roles between FrameNet and LVD. In this paper,
we propose a method of automatically linking the Eng-
lish FrameNet lexical entries to HowNet concepts, re-
sulting in a bilingual FrameNet. We make use of two
bilingual English-Chinese lexicons, as well as HowNet
and FrameNet. In the following sections 3.1 to 3.3, we
use an example FrameNet lexical entry “beat.v” in the
“cause_harm” frame to illustrate the main steps of our
algorithm in Figure 1.
For each lexical entry l in FrameNet
Find translations T1 of l in HowNet translations.
Find translations T2 of l in LDC dictionary.
Combine the T1 and T2 together as T. T= T1UT2
Link l to all HowNet concepts LC whose W_C field
is in T. LC= {cJc.W_C C T}, c is any HowNet
concept.
For each frame F in FrameNet
Group all the HowNet concepts together FC which
are linked to the lexical entries in F. FC= {cJ
link(c,l)=true and l C F}.
Compute the frequency of HowNet categories in FC.

3.1 Baseline mapping based on bilingual lexicon
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998419266666667">
We use the bilingual lexicon from HowNet and LDC
dictionary to first create all possible mappings between
FrameNet lexical entries and HowNet concepts whose
part-of-speech (POS) tags are the same. Here we as-
sume that syntactic classification for the majority of
FrameNet lexical entries (i.e. verbs and adjectives) are
semantically motivated and are mostly preserved across
different languages. For example “beat” can be trans-
lated into {搥, A, 冲击, 出手, 难倒, 骗取, 赢, ht
A...} in HowNet and {#T, #TA, 捣, 敲#T, 赢...} in
the LDC English-Chinese dictionary. “beat.v” is then
linked to all HowNet concepts whose Chinese
word/phrase is one of the translations and the part of
speech is verb “v”. Figure 2 shows some examples of
HowNet concepts that are linked to “beat.v”.

3.2 Disambiguation by semantic contexts in both
languages
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999839375">
At this stage, each FrameNet lexical entry has links to
multiple HowNet concepts and categories. For example,
“beat.v” in “cause_harm” frame is linked to “打” in
both the “beat” category and the “associate” category
(as in“打电话/make a phone call”). We need to choose
the correct HowNet concept (word sense). Many word
sense disambiguation algorithms use contextual words
in a sentence as disambiguating features. In this work,
we make use of contextual lexical entries from the same
semantic frame, as illustrated below:
To disambiguate between the above two candidate cate-
gories, we make use of the other lexical entries in
“cause_harm”, such as “捶”, and their linked categories
in HowNet, such as “beat” again. Each target HowNet
category receives a vote from the candidate links. In our
example, “beat” receives two votes (from “打” and from
“捶”), and “associate” only one (from “打”). We choose
the HowNet category with the most votes and its con-
stituent concepts to be the valid word sense links to the
source FrameNet lexical entry. Consequently, “beat.v”
in “cause_harm” is linked to all HowNet concepts that
are translations of “beat” which are verbs, and which
also belong to the HowNet category “beat” (vs. “associ-
ate”).

“cause_harm” frame in FrameNet. Only the concepts in
the top N categories are considered as correctly linked
to the lexical entries in the “cause_harm” frame. We
heuristically chose N to be three in our algorithm.
3.3 Compensating links by HowNet taxonomy struc-
ture
Using frame context alone in the above step can effec-
tively prune out incorrect links, but it also prunes some
correct links whose HowNet categories are not in the
top three categories but are similar to them. In this next
step, we aim to recover this kind of pruned links. We
introduce the category similarity score, which is based
on the HowNet taxonomy distance (Liu and Li, 2002):

<equation confidence="0.9726485">
α
Sim(category1,category2) =
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999759090909091">
In our example, some valid categories, such as “firing|
射击” is not selected in the previous step even though it
is related to the “cause_harm” frame. Based on the
HowNet taxonomy, the similarity score between “firing|
射击” and “beat|打” is 1.0, which we consider as high.
Hence, “firing|射击” is also chosen as a valid category
and the concepts in this category are linked to the
“beat.v” lexical entry in the “cause_harm” frame. How-
ever, using taxonomy distance can cause erros such as
打 in the “weave” category to be aligned to “beat.v” in
the “cause_harm” frame.

controls the curvature of the similarity score. We set

one of the top three categories is higher than a threshold
t, the category p is also considered as a valid category
for the frame.

4 Evaluation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998720764705882">
We evaluate our work by comparing the results to a
manually set golden standard of links for the most am-
biguous lexical entries in FrameNet, and use the preci-
sion and recall rate as evaluation criteria. To show the
lower bound of the system performance, we chose six
FrameNet lexical entries with the most links to HowNet
concepts as the test set. Since each link is a word sense,
these lexical entries have the most ambiguous transla-
tions. Such lexical entries also turned out to be mostly
verbs. Since the number of lexical entries in a FrameNet
parent frame (i.e. frame size) is an important factor in
the disambiguation step, we analyze our results by dis-
tinguishing between “small frame”s (a frame with less
than 5 lexical entries) and “large frame”s. 24% of the
frames are “small frames”. Results in Tables 2 and 3
have a weighted average of
(0.649*0.24+0.874*0.76)=82% F-measure.

The alignment results can be found at
http://www.cs.ust.hk/~hltc/BiFrameNet. Our evaluation
shows that our method has achieved an 82% average F-
measure in aligning the most ambiguous FrameNet lexi-
cal entries to HowNet concepts. This paper describes
the first stage in our project towards creating a bi-
lingual English-Chinese FrameNet, by aligning lexical
entries between FrameNet and HowNet. The next step is
to automatically extract semantically annotated Chinese
sentences based on the annotated English sentences in
FrameNet, the aligned FrameNet lexical entries, and
bilingual corpora. We expect the final bilingual Frame-
Net will provide a valuable resource for multi-lingual or
cross-lingual natural language processing.
