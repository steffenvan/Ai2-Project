The detection of attitude and subjectivity in text has received increased attention over
the past several years. Whereas standard text classification typically deals with the
identification of the topic of a text, it has become clear that attitudes expressed in
the text constitute another very useful dimension. With the rapid rise of customer-
produced content such as product reviews on the Web, for example, opinion mining has
become an important and viable technology in business intelligence. Similarly, question
answering and information retrieval have been shown to benefit from the detection of
attitude and subjectivity, and—as this new collection shows—the range of other possible
applications is large.
The volume contains 24 extended versions of papers that were originally presented
at the American Association for Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) Spring Symposium on
Exploring Attitude and Affect in Text: Theories and Applications at Stanford University
in 2004, organized by the editors of this volume. This symposium was the first such
event to focus exclusively on this topic. Since then, there has been a surge of work in
the area; today one is hard pressed to find a major conference in the field that does
not have a workshop or a dedicated session on the topic. Publicly available annotated
corpora such as the MPQA corpus (Multi-Perspective Question Answering) and the
movie review corpus from Cornell University have contributed greatly to a focused
research effort.
The chapters in the book are arranged in three consecutive categories: Linguistic
and Cognitive Models, Lexical Resources and Attitude/Affect Recognition and Gen-
eration, and Applications. For brevity, I will discuss only a sample of the papers, to
give an impression of the breadth of the research. The first eight papers explore the
linguistic complexity of the expression of attitude and the cognitive background of these
expressions. Polanyi and Zaenen, and Karlgren, Eriksson, and Franz´en investigate how
context word choices and syntactic structure can influence and change the attitudinal
dimension of an expression. Bucci and Maskit approach the problem from a psycholog-
ical angle; with multiple annotated data sets, they use statistical methods to identify a
weighted set of words corresponding to the psycholinguistic dimension of Referential
Activity (roughly equivalent to the capability of a text to evoke nonverbal experience).
Stoyanov et al. discuss the annotation scheme used in the MPQA corpus.
The next seven papers of the collection touch on an even wider range of areas, focus-
ing on lexical resources and the automatic detection and generation of affect. Bethard
et al. use semantic parsing to identify opinion clauses and their holders, pointing out
that doing so can be beneficial for tasks where it is important to distinguish opinion from
fact, such as summarization, information extraction, and question answering. Teufel
explores the role of affect structure for improved citation indexing of academic papers,
which often contain indications of whether a citation is used in support or in contrast
Computational Linguistics Volume 33, Number 2
to the proposed hypothesis or experimental results. Inkpen, Feiguina, and Hirst explore
the possibility of changing affect in language generation, presenting the same content
in positive or negative terms.
The Applications section of the book starts with two investigations of the use of Sys-
temic Functional Grammar, one for assessing interpersonal distance in text and the other
for identifying genre distinctions. The next two articles deal with the argumentative
structure of text. Argumentative structure is used here for critiquing scientific abstracts
by novice writers. DiMarco et al. examine the role of hedging in citation contexts in
scientific papers, work that is closely related to Teufel’s paper in the previous section.
Two articles in this section examine machine-learning techniques: for feature selection
and for feature generalization. The latter is performed in the joint extraction of topics
and their associated opinions, using WordNet as a resource to identify synonymy and
hypernymy. Tong and Yager’s work addresses the summarization of temporal trends
in opinions using Internet data sources such as blogs and newsgroups. The remaining
papers deal with the summarization of viewpoints, and with creating labeled data for
good versus bad news from the reaction of financial markets to company news.
It should be clear from this quick overview that there is no shortage of perspectives
on the topic of affect and attitude in text in this collection. Although this breadth may
seem at first glance to pull in too many diverse directions, the reader should keep in
mind that it is exactly this diversity of perspectives that is the hallmark of a successful
first meeting dedicated to the topic. No one will come away from a reading of this
volume with a narrow and simplistic view of the problem, and it would be surprising
if the papers did not spark additional ideas in the interested reader.
The volume could have benefitted, however, from some more thorough editorial
organization to bring more structure into the collection. The categorization into three
main topics is not indicated in the table of contents; it seems to be more of a hasty
afterthought. For many papers, it is not clear at all why they are part of one section
rather than another. A more thorough introduction could have helped to categorize
the papers along various possible dimensions. These dimensions could include features
and resources used (words, part-of-speech tags, deeper linguistic analysis, semantic
resources), type of attitude/affect computed (simple polarity, trending, interpersonal
distance, argumentative structure, certainty, multiple viewpoints, hedging, etc.), and
type of data (product review texts, news, blogs/newsgroups, scientific writing, tran-
scribed dialogues).
In summary, this volume should become an indispensable resource for anyone
interested in this area. Whether the reader is more interested in the computational or the
linguistic aspects of the problem—or even just the range of possible applications—this
collection will broaden the perspective on the issue. For readers with no background in
sentiment detection the volume can serve as an initial overview of the field, with the
caveat that they would have to do some additional reading of both earlier seminal work
such as Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1997), Wiebe (2000), Turney (2002), and Pang,
Lee, and Vaithyanathan (2002), and some more recent developments (as can be found
in recent proceedings of COLING, ACL, and EMNLP).
