This paper presents X-Space, a system that fol-
lows the ISO-Space annotation scheme in or-
der to capture spatial information as well as
our contribution to the SemEval-2015 task 8
(SpaceEval). Our system is the only partici-

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999904434782609">
Nowadays the need for algorithms that have the
ability to reason spatially over texts are in growing
demand within applications concerning human lan-
guage processing and in navigation services. Well-
studied topics in computational linguistics such as
named entity recognition and question answering,
for example, will presumably experience important
progress through such algorithms. Navigation sys-
tems, on the other hand, will gain the ability to in-
terpret indications given by users beyond the “string
matching” methods used at present (Wu et al., 2010).
In order for such systems to reason spatially, how-
ever, they require the enrichment of textual data with
the annotation of spatial information in language
(Pustejovsky et al., 2013). As of today there have
been several attempts at capturing spatial informa-
tion (annotation schemes): SpatialML (Mani et al.,
2008), Spatial Role Labeling (Kordjamshidi et al.,
2010) and ISO-Space (Pustejovsky et al., 2011). X-
Space follows the ISO-Space specification.
Section 2 describes the system architecture and
section 3 presents the results and discusses them. Fi-
nally, our conclusions are given in section 4.

X-Space uses a four-stage pipeline: first texts are
preprocessed; second candidates to be spatial ele-
ments and signals are selected by generating word
lists from the texts; then, spatial elements and sig-
nals are identified from the candidate lists and their
attributes set according to type. Finally, spatial rela-
tions are established between the previously identi-
fied and the attributes that correspond to these rela-
tions are set.

2.1 Preprocessing and Candidate Selection
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999309428571429">
As an initial step texts that are inputted into X-Space
are syntactically and semantically parsed (SRL), and
named entities as well as coreference chains are
identified. These annotations are used in the later
stages as features for machine learning.
The parsing of syntactic and semantic dependen-
cies is achieved with the ClearNLP semantic role la-
beler (Choi and Palmer, 2012); for the recognition
of named entities, on the other hand, the Apache
OpenNLP name finder tool is used (Baldridge,
2005). Chains of coreference are identified using
the Standford CoreNLP coreference resolution sys-
tem (Manning et al., 2014).
After the preprocessing of input texts is per-
formed the words that compose these texts are used
to form candidate lists by taking words one-by-one,
two-by-two, three-by-three and four-by-four. We as-
sume that spatial elements and signals with more
than four words are highly improbable to occur. For
this reason only candidates with up to four words are
considered.

2.2 Spatial Elements and Signals
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999953941176471">
Five different spatial elements are distinguished:
places and paths which designate a region of space
(locations); spatial entities, words of motion and
non-motion events. These do not designate a region
of space but are allowed to be coerced into behaving
like a region of space, so that they may participate in
the same kinds of relationships as regions of space
(Pustejovsky and Yocum, 2013).
In order to identify places, paths and words of
motion we have used WordNet as well as several
other resources such as PropBank and the Predi-
cate Matrix (de Lacalle et al., 2014) in combination
with a binary Support Vector Machine classifier im-
plemented using the SVM-light package (Joachims,
1999). For spatial entities and non-motion events,
on the other hand, an approach without WordNet is
used for reasons that are discussed in 2.2.2.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.521813">
2.2.1 The WordNet approach
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999993942028986">
The WordNet approach is used to identify words
of motion, paths and places within the lists of
candidates. This approach is based on the idea that
within the hierarchical organization of WordNet a
domain, as for example the path domain, can be
defined as a set of subtrees by properly identifying
the root of these subtrees. According to (Feizabadi
and Padó, 2012) the challenge is to find a set of
nodes whose subtrees cover as much as possible of
the desired domain while avoiding overgeneration.
Root nodes We consider these nodes to be
the ones that best fulfill these conditions after
manually examining WordNet (v3.0): for the
motion domain we have considered nodes “move,
locomote, travel, go” (01835496-V) and “to be”
(02604760-V); for the place domain, on the other
hand, we have considered nodes “topographic
point, place spot” (08664443-N), “place, property”
(08513718-N), “position, place” (08621598-N),
“location” (00027167-N), “state, nation, country,
land, commonwealth, res publica, body politic”
(08168978-N), “country, state, land” (08544813-N),
“country, rural area” (08644722-N) and “area, coun-
try” (08497294-N). Finally, for the path domain
we have considered nodes “path” (03899328-N),
“path, route, itinerary” (08616311-N), “path, track,
course” (09387222-N) and “way” (04564698-N).
Domain definition After the place and path
domains are defined by capturing the corresponding
sets of subtrees, the domains are completed by
adding the places and paths in the training set that
are not covered by the subtrees. In total 5,572 places
and 664 paths form the final domains. For motion
words, however, most of them being verbs, sense
needs to be disambiguated; as a matter of fact many
verbs have motion as well as non-motion senses.
X-Space uses the Predicate Matrix (v1.1) in order
to map the WordNet synset IDs that correspond
to the subtrees rooted in the nodes that have been
considered for the motion domain (01835496-V and
02604760-V) with their corresponding PropBank
sense. The Predicate Matrix is a lexical resource
resulting from the integration of multiple sources
of predicate information, including FrameNet,
VerbNet, PropBank and WordNet. 511 senses form
the words of motion domain used by our system.
Identification process When domains are
defined X-Space iterates over the list of candidates
in search for places and paths. Words of motion, on
the contrary, are only looked for in the one-by-one
candidate list as we consider that only these can be
words of motion. For the identification of words
of motion the disambiguation of senses is used
which is performed in the semantic dependency
parsing in the preprocessing stage. This way only
the candidates labeled with a sense present in the
words of motion domain will be identified as such.
Avoiding overgeneration We observed that
too many candidates were identified using just the
straightforward procedure, where candidates are
looked for in the domains. In order to avoid this
over-generation we attached a machine-learning
module to the identification process. The classifier
used is a binary classifier based on Support Vector
Machines, and once the identification of places,
paths and words of motion within the identification
process is completed, the classifier decides whether
an identified element is or not correctly identified.
The following is the list of the features used:

X-Space uses this classifier (same set of features,
same implementation) several times throughout the
entire process of annotating input texts with spa-
tial information. The reason not to perform a thor-
ough feature selection process whenever machine
learning needs to be used throughout the annotation
conducted by X-Space lies in the time limitations
we encountered due to the extent of the SpaceEval
task. The values taken by the training parameters
are shown next:

2.2.2 Other approaches
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99997511627907">
This section describes the approaches used to
identify non-motion events, spatial entities and
signals from the candidates lists. The reason why
the WordNet approach is not used on non-motion
events is that we could not accurately determine
a set of nodes whose subtrees cover the desired
domain properly. For spatial entities, on the other
hand, we believe that using the WordNet approach
is not correct given the heterogeneous nature of
these spatial elements. We also believe that the
same reason applies not to use WordNet in the
identification of spatial and motion signals. All
three use a classifier like the one in section 2.2.1 as
a final step to avoid overgeneration.
Non-motion events In order to identify non-
motion events our system first generates a list with
the PropBank senses taken by the non-motion
events in the training set. Then X-Space iterates
over the one-by-one candidate list (as we consider
that only these can be ISO-Space non-motion
events) and checks whether a candidate is labeled
with one of these senses or not. With this aim in
mind the disambiguation of senses is used that has
been performed in the preprocessing.
Spatial entities For the identification of spatial
entities the semantic role labels have been used that
were given by the semantic dependency parser to
predicate arguments. We believe spatial entities
to be viewable as arguments of a predicate which
is a word of motion or a word that expresses a
non-motion event. Arguments that correspond to
these kind of predicates are in the majority of cases
located in space and participate in ISO-Space link
tags. These, therefore, can be understood as spatial
entities. In order to identify spatial entities X-Space
iterates over the lists of candidates and searches
for arguments of words that have been previously
marked as of motion or as expressing a non-motion
event.
Signals For the purpose of identifying sig-
nals two lists are formed based on the signal
annotations in the training set. One list holds the
signals that are exclusively of motion (e.g., into,
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999719928571429">
from) and another list holds the signals that can
only be of space (e.g., within, without). Then X-
Space iterates over the one-by-one and two-by-two
candidate lists. As we observed in the training set,
only signals with up to two words occurred. In
the iteration process candidates are looked for in
both lists; if a candidate can be found in the spatial
signals list, it is assigned the spatial signal tag; on
the other hand, if the candidate is present in the
motion signals list this is marked as a motion signal.
Many signals, however, overlap, meaning that they
can be of motion and space (e.g., by, over). In
order to capture these signals the candidate lists are
searched for prepositions and function words.

2.2.3 Attribute identification
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999892583333333">
The ISO-Space annotation language specifies sev-
eral attributes for spatial elements as well as for sig-
nals. The classifier in section 2.2.1 is used to give
values to these attributes. When an attribute can
take more than two values, however, a version of
the classifier that has been extended from binary to
multiclass is used. This is achieved with the SVM-
multiclass package. Several attributes are specified.
However, not all attributes are given values: in fact
many of them are never annotated in the training set,
and for this reason X-Space does not annotate them
either.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998915">
2.3 Spatial Relation Links
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999947428571429">
When the spatial elements and the signals within
the input texts as well as their corresponding at-
tributes are identified X-Space tries to detect the spa-
tial relations that lay between them. The SpaceEval
task addresses the detection of three types of rela-
tions: movement (MoveLink), qualitative (QSLink)
and orientational (OLink).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.755416">
2.3.1 Link identification
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99996475">
In order to identify the spatial relation links, X-
Space follows what is stated in (Pustejovsky and
Yocum, 2013). For movement relations that typi-
cally involve motion-event triggers (words of mo-
tion), motion signals, and motion-event participants
a link is created for each identified word of motion.
For qualitative relations, on the other hand, which
normally involve spatial signals and spatial elements
and are used to capture topological relationships,
a link of this type is created for each spatial sig-
nal with an identified TOPOLOGICAL or DIR_TOP
semantic_type. Finally, an orientational link is
introduced for every spatial signal with a DIREC-
TIONAL semantic_type; this kind of link de-
scribes non-topological relationships between spa-
tial signals and spatial elements.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.894437">
2.3.2 Attribute identification
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999904081081081">
There are several attributes specified by the
ISO-Space annotation scheme for the MoveLink,
QSLink and OLink relations. Nonetheless, not
all these attributes are viewed, and, consequently,
identified by X-Space following the same proce-
dure. In fact, the system distinguishes three types of
attributes: triggers, which are the spatial elements
or signals that trigger the creation of links, roles,
which are the spatial elements involved in these
relations and common attributes, which indicate
other characteristics of the links.
Triggers Triggers are directly established
for all three kinds of links based on the link identifi-
cation process.
Roles We believe that attributes source,
goal, mover and landmark within a MoveLink
relation can be seen as arguments of the trigger,
which is usually a verbal predicate (word of mo-
tion). For a QSLink or OLink relation, on the other
hand, we think that attributes trajector and
landmark can be seen as arguments of the predi-
cate that dominates the trigger, which is usually a
preposition (spatial signal). The idea behind these
attributes is based on the Spatial Role Labeling
annotation schema described in (Kordjamshidi
et al., 2010). According to this scheme there are
indicators that can be spatial (spatial signals) or
of motion (words of motion) that introduce spatial
relations. These spatial relations take arguments
with roles trajector and landmark. For this
reason, in order to identify attributes source,
goal, mover and landmark of MoveLinks,
X-Space looks for arguments of the triggers using
the semantic dependency parsing carried out in the
preprocessing. Then it establishes which PropBank
argument (A0, A1, A2, etc.) corresponds to which
attribute (spatial role) using a multiclass classifier

3 Results
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999964266666667">
The SpaceEval task considers three separate eval-
uation configurations: (1) only unannotated text is
given as an input; (2) manually annotated spatial el-
ement extents (no attributes) are given; (3) manually
annotated spatial element extents and their attributes
are given.
The subtasks that are evaluated for each config-
uration are: (1-a) identifying spans of spatial el-
ements, (1-b) classifying spatial elements accord-
ing to type, (1-c) identifying attributes for spa-
tial elements according to type, (1-d) identify-
ing MoveLink, QSLink and OLink relations and
(1-e) identifying attributes for spatial relations;
(2-a) classifying spatial elements and identifying
their attributes according to type, (2-b) identifying
MoveLink, QSLink and OLink relations and (2-c)
identifying attributes for spatial relations; (3-a) iden-
tifying MoveLink, QSLink and OLink relations and
(3-b) identifying attributes for spatial relations.
Table 1 shows the results obtained by X-Space in
every configuration and subtask and compares them
with the results of one baseline system provided by
the task organizers. As can be noted our results im-
prove the ones in the baseline for 1-a, 1-b, 1-c, 1-d,
1-e and 2-a. On the other hand, our results are worse
for 2-b, 2-c, 3-a and 3-b. From the three systems that
participated in the SpaceEval task ours was the only
one that presented results for all evaluation configu-
rations and all subtasks. We believe that in general
the results for our system are good.

In this paper X-Space, our contribution to the

that many things still remain to be improved. For
instance, the problem of annotating non-consuming

In the future, we intend to adapt our system to
other languages. This adaptation will bring the op-

This approach is based on the idea that within the hierarchical organization of WordNet a domain, as for example the path domain, can be defined as a set of subtrees by properly identifying the root of these subtrees. According to (Feizabadi and Padó, 2012) the challenge is to find a set of nodes whose subtrees cover as much as possible of the desired domain while avoiding overgeneration. Root nodes We consider these nodes to be the ones that best fulfill these conditions after manually examining WordNet (v3.0): for the motion domain we have considered nodes “move, locomote, travel, go” (01835496-V) and “to be” (02604760-V); for the place domain, on the other hand, we have considered nodes “topographic point, place spot” (08664443-N), “place, property” (08513718-N), “position, place” (08621598-N), “location” (00027167-N), “state, nation, country</context>

The SpaceEval task addresses the detection of three types of relations: movement (MoveLink), qualitative (QSLink) and orientational (OLink). 2.3.1 Link identification In order to identify the spatial relation links, XSpace follows what is stated in (Pustejovsky and Yocum, 2013). For movement relations that typically involve motion-event triggers (words of motion), motion signals, and motion-event participants a link is created for each identified word of motion. For qualitative relations, on the other hand, which normally involve spatial signals and spatial elements and are used to capture topological relationships, a link of this type is created for each spatial signal with an identified TOPOLOGICAL or DIR_TOP semantic_type. Finally, an orientational link is introduced for every spatial signal with a DIRECTIONAL semantic_type; this kind of link describes non-topolo</context>
