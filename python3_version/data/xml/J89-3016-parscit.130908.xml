fully, and with a pedagogically attractive style, it dis-
cusses topics related to expert systems (e.g., represen-
tation, rules, shells, explanation, and confidence
factors) as well as topics related to natural language
processing (e.g., conjunctions, inflection, left-recur-
sion, question-answering, and scoping). All of this com-
bines to provide a very concrete, yet readable, intro-
duction to these fields. It achieves this through
examples, woven with explanations that are clear. All
coded examples have just enough odd details to reas-
sure us that they have survived a process of close
scrutiny and debugging.
Chapter 2 is of special note. &amp;quot;A Prolog to Prolog&amp;quot; by
John Sowa is perhaps the best informal introduction to
Prolog I have ever read. I found it both thorough and
complete, but written in a style that makes it pleasant
and delightful to learn. Pure Prolog techniques are
applied to several classic and novel artificial intelligence
problems. Simple, direct comparisons are made to
standard logic (with quantifiers), to Pascal record struc-
tures, and to relational data bases. Unification is ex-
plained with a few simple examples and criteria for
reversible predicates are given.
Chapter 3 discusses more advanced programming
techniques in Prolog. Here, the book departs slightly
from its concentration on classic artificial intelligence
problems to discuss the more mundane issues of Prolog
itself: data structures, unification, control structures,
labels, and metavariables. Later in the chapter, tech-
niques for representing and searching graphs and trees
are presented along with a worked-out example of
alpha-beta pruning. Throughout the book, principles of
good Prolog programming style are emphasized. At the
conclusion of this chapter, these are summarized into a
neat list of 11 guidelines. Warnings about side effects
and the judicious use of cuts are similarly presented.
Syllog (from &amp;quot;syllogism&amp;quot;) is described in Chapter 4;
it represents an expert system shell embedded in Pro-
log. It features some interesting ideas for implementing
the interpreter based on backchain iteration which,
when run, leads eventually to a fixed point representing
the answer. Several sample expert systems built from
Syllog are also presented in the chapter. PLANTDOC,
for example, is a MYCIN-like system that diagnoses
disease in garden plants. It serves to illustrate reasoning
using confidence factors, frames, and explanation tech-
niques.
In Chapter 5, the book presents a score of methods
for constructing syntactic structures from inputs, a
particular semantic model, and a set of techniques for
mapping syntactic structures to semantic forms. It
demonstrates the ease with which input sentences can
be coerced into logical expressions of meaning (ex-
pressed in &amp;quot;Logical Form Language&amp;quot;). Much of this
chapter has appeared in recent research articles by
McCord and, to his credit, he is able to clearly present
solutions to some rather complicated issues.
In the chapter, definite clause grammars (DCGs) are
introduced first. Since these are so clean and elegant in
their simplicity, they nicely introduce some of the
mechanisms for natural language processing in Prolog.
Next, modular logic grammars (MLGs) are introduced
and shown to allow for a greater degree of modularity
between syntax and semantics. The bulk of the chapter
is dedicated to deriving solutions to a variety of prob-
lems using MLG. The range of issues and the degree of
detailed discussion are impressive. In the conclusion, a
natural language question-answering system for a uni-
versity data base is presented.
I have very few criticisms of the book. It is based
entirely on IBM Prolog with little or no effort to provide
information about other implementations of Prolog. An
appendix is provided which serves as a type of refer-
ence manual for IBM Prolog. Perhaps the book could be
more generic, but then I feel it would undermine its
reliance on concrete examples that the reader can
confidently run. Most readers will not find this to be a
difficult problem and the slight effort required to over-
come the problem is well worth it. I found very few
errors and all were very minor (e.g., missing existential
quantifier on page 49). They never detract from what
the author is saying.
I was impressed with this book. Much of the credit
for this certainly belongs with the editor, Adrian
Walker, who does a marvelous job of weaving together
a coherent book from the contributions of his co-
authors. The credentials of the supporting cast are
equally impeccable. I found many enjoyable segments
in the book. Although an appendix is provided which
discusses the logical basis of Prolog and Syllog, I think
it would be difficult to use this book for the logical
fundamentals of Prolog, as the authors suggest. How-
ever, it is certainly an important reference and could
easily be used as a textbook in support of a course on
artificial intelligence, Prolog programming, expert sys-
tems, or natural language processing.

This book presents an interdisciplinary analysis of social,
cognitive, situational, and contextual aspects of language
and language processing by first and second language
speakers. Linguists and psychologists formulate theoreti-
cal models and empirical analyses of the influence of such
factors as on various levels of language processing. These
relate specifically to syntactic and semantic parsing, lexical
selection, and text production. The issue of &amp;quot;hearer orien-
tation&amp;quot; in language use lies at the forefront of interest in
this anthology, and is tackled from such different fields as
linguistics, text linguistics, formal semantics, social psy-
chology, psychology of language, artificial intelligence, and
second language acquisition.
