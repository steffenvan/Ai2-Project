from philosophical and computational points of view.
Subsequently, the attempt to build language processing
programs that had a sound philosophical basis was a
distinctive feature of the Unit&apos;s work. This approach to
language processing, and the specific form it took in the
proposed use of a thesaurus as the main vehicle for
semantic operations, will probably come to be seen as the
Unit&apos;s major contribution to the field as a whole, and it
was Margaret who was primarily responsible for them.
Her vision of language processing and its possibilities was
remarkable for a time when computers were very rudi-
mentary: indeed much of the CLRU&apos;s work had to be
done on the predecessors of computers, namely punched
card machines. Equally, Margaret&apos;s determination in
establishing and maintaining the Unit, with the enormous
effort in fund raising that this involved, was very striking:
the fact that the Unit could continue for several decades,
and in particular through periods when support for work
in the area was hard to come by, is a tribute to
Margaret&apos;s persistence. It is difficult for us now, in these
days of artificial intelligence in the ordinary market place,
and very powerful personal computers, to realise how
hard it was to get the financial resources needed for
language-processing research, and equally, the technical
resources to do the actual experiments.
Perhaps the best comment on Margaret&apos;s initiative in
embarking on language processing research, and specif-
ically on machine translation work, comes from a some-
what unexpected source. Machine translation, after an
initial period of high hopes, and some large claims, was
cast into outer darkness by the funding agencies who saw
little return for their money, and has only recently
revived. Reviewing 25 years of artificial intelligence
research in his presidential address to the American
Association for Artificial Intelligence in 1985, Woody
Bledsoe, one of the longstanding leaders of the field,
though in areas quite outside language, said of those who
attempted machine translation in the fifties and sixties:
they may have failed, but they were right to try; we have
learned so much from their attempts to do something so
difficult.
What she and CLRU were trying to do was far ahead
of its time. Efforts were made to tackle fundamental
problems which overstrained the capacity of the comput-
ers of the day and the programming tools then available.
Despite every kind of problem, the Unit produced
numerous publications on language and related subjects
including information retrieval and automatic classifica-
tion. For over ten years the Unit&apos;s presence was strongly
felt in the field, always with an emphasis on basic seman-
tic problems of language understanding. Margaret had no
time for those who felt that all that needed doing was
syntactic parsing, or that complete parsing was necessary
before you did anything else. Now that the semantics of
language are regarded as a basic part of its understanding
by machine, the ideas around CLRU seem curiously
modern.
Margaret&apos;s main contribution to the life of CLRU was
in the continual intellectual stimulus she gave to the
Unit&apos;s research, and through this to the larger natural
language processing community: she had wide ranging
concerns, and lateral ideas, which led her, for example, to
propose the thesaurus as a means of carrying out many
distinct language processing tasks, like indexing and
translation. Margaret&apos;s emphasis on algorithms, and on
testing them, was particularly important for the develop-
ment of the Unit&apos;s work on language processing; but her
ideas were notable, especially for those who worked with
her, not just for their technical qualities, but for their
sheer joyousness.
Her colleagues and students will always remember her
for her inspiration, not her written papers: she made
questions of philosophy and language processing seem
both closely related and, above all, desperately impor-
tant. On their joint solutions hung the solutions of a
range of old and serious questions about life and the
universe. In this, as so much else, she was a Wittgenstei-
nian but, unlike him, she was optimistic and believed
that, with the aid of the digital computer it could be
done.
She could not only inspire and create, but terrify and
destroy: she had the dual aspects of Shiva, an analogy
she would have appreciated. Even in her seventies, still
funded by European Commission grants, her hair still
black because a gypsy had told her forty years before
that it would not go grey if she never washed it, she
would rise slowly and massively at the end of a talk,
bulky in her big, belted, fisherman&apos;s pullover, to attack a
speaker, who would be quaking if he had any idea what
might be coming. The attack always began softly and
slowly, dovelike and gentle, gathering speed and rough-
ness as it went. As many readers may remember, there
was no knowing where it might lead.

<abstract confidence="0.99614635483871">from philosophical and computational points of view. Subsequently, the attempt to build language processing programs that had a sound philosophical basis was a distinctive feature of the Unit&apos;s work. This approach to language processing, and the specific form it took in the proposed use of a thesaurus as the main vehicle for semantic operations, will probably come to be seen as the Unit&apos;s major contribution to the field as a whole, and it was Margaret who was primarily responsible for them. Her vision of language processing and its possibilities was remarkable for a time when computers were very rudimentary: indeed much of the CLRU&apos;s work had to be done on the predecessors of computers, namely punched card machines. Equally, Margaret&apos;s determination in establishing and maintaining the Unit, with the enormous effort in fund raising that this involved, was very striking: the fact that the Unit could continue for several decades, and in particular through periods when support for work in the area was hard to come by, is a tribute to Margaret&apos;s persistence. It is difficult for us now, in these days of artificial intelligence in the ordinary market place, and very powerful personal computers, to realise how hard it was to get the financial resources needed for language-processing research, and equally, the technical resources to do the actual experiments. Perhaps the best comment on Margaret&apos;s initiative in embarking on language processing research, and specifically on machine translation work, comes from a somewhat unexpected source. Machine translation, after an initial period of high hopes, and some large claims, was cast into outer darkness by the funding agencies who saw little return for their money, and has only recently revived. Reviewing 25 years of artificial intelligence research in his presidential address to the American Association for Artificial Intelligence in 1985, Woody Bledsoe, one of the longstanding leaders of the field, though in areas quite outside language, said of those who attempted machine translation in the fifties and sixties: they may have failed, but they were right to try; we have learned so much from their attempts to do something so difficult. she and trying to do was far ahead of its time. Efforts were made to tackle fundamental problems which overstrained the capacity of the computers of the day and the programming tools then available. Despite every kind of problem, the Unit produced numerous publications on language and related subjects including information retrieval and automatic classification. For over ten years the Unit&apos;s presence was strongly felt in the field, always with an emphasis on basic semantic problems of language understanding. Margaret had no time for those who felt that all that needed doing was syntactic parsing, or that complete parsing was necessary before you did anything else. Now that the semantics of language are regarded as a basic part of its understanding by machine, the ideas around CLRU seem curiously modern. main contribution to the life of in the continual intellectual stimulus she gave to the Unit&apos;s research, and through this to the larger natural language processing community: she had wide ranging concerns, and lateral ideas, which led her, for example, to propose the thesaurus as a means of carrying out many distinct language processing tasks, like indexing and translation. Margaret&apos;s emphasis on algorithms, and on testing them, was particularly important for the development of the Unit&apos;s work on language processing; but her ideas were notable, especially for those who worked with her, not just for their technical qualities, but for their sheer joyousness. Her colleagues and students will always remember her for her inspiration, not her written papers: she made questions of philosophy and language processing seem both closely related and, above all, desperately important. On their joint solutions hung the solutions of a range of old and serious questions about life and the universe. In this, as so much else, she was a Wittgensteinian but, unlike him, she was optimistic and believed that, with the aid of the digital computer it could be done. She could not only inspire and create, but terrify and destroy: she had the dual aspects of Shiva, an analogy she would have appreciated. Even in her seventies, still funded by European Commission grants, her hair still black because a gypsy had told her forty years before that it would not go grey if she never washed it, she would rise slowly and massively at the end of a talk, bulky in her big, belted, fisherman&apos;s pullover, to attack a speaker, who would be quaking if he had any idea what might be coming. The attack always began softly and dovelike and gentle, speed and roughas it went. As readers may remember, there was no knowing where it might lead.</abstract>

It will be a multidisciplinary event, consisting of 35 conferences and workshops, which will cover different areas and fields of knowledge. The sessions and events will take place in San Sebastian, Vitoria, and Bilbao. The Second World Basque Congress has a double objective. • First, to deal with present-day topics from a scientific and universal viewpoint, in an attempt to find solutions to social problems. • Second, to offer an adequate framework for the strengthening of ties between the Basque Country and the international scientific community, at the same time serving as an appropriate stage for the exchange of ideas, methods, and recommendations in the scientific, technical, and cultural fields. The International Conference on Artificial Intelligence is one of the Conferences of this Congress. Its program will consists of invited and contributed papers, of which the latter will be accepted after evaluation by the Scientific Committee, made up of a group of specialists. A book and machine exchibition will be held in parallel with the Conference. Tools and Applications: Industrial and commercial organizations will exhibit operational products or advanced prototypes.</abstract>
