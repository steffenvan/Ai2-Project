Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999956652173913">
The interpretation of coercion construc-
tions (to begin a book) has been recently
considered as resulting from the operation
of type changing. For instance, a phrase of
type o (object) is coerced to a phrase of type
e (event) under the influence of the predi-
cate. We show that this procedure encoun-
ters empirical difficulties. Focussing on the
begin/commencer case, we show that the co-
ercion interpretation results both from gen-
eral semantic processes and properties of
the predicate, and we argue that it is best
represented at the lexical level. The solu-
tion is formulated in the HPSG formalism,
where the lexical description of heads in-
cludes a specification of the argument and
articulates syntax and semantics. We pro-
pose that the properties attached to the
complement remain the same as they are
oustside the construction, but that the se-
mantics of the predicate is enriched to in-
clude an abstract predicate of which the
complement is an argument.

Predicates require that their arguments be of a given

the construction. This traditional problem has been
recently rephrased within type theory, where types
(like e for events, p for material objects, ic for kinds,
etc.) classify the domain of entities (cf. [Bach, 1986;
Carlson, 1977; Chierchia, 1984]). Pustejovsky pro-
poses in particular that the mismatch is solved by the
operation of &amp;quot;type coercion&amp;quot; (cf.fPustejovsky, 1991;
Pustejovsky and Anick, 1988; Boguraev and Puste-
jovsky, 1991]). In essence, it confers to the predicate
the ability to change the argument type. For ex-
ample, the sequence in (1) is accounted for in the
following way:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.410797">
(1) John began the book.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999982217391304">
The predicate associated with begin requires that the
argument corresponding to the complement be an
event (type e). Since the type associated with book
is different (we will suppose it is &amp;quot;material object&amp;quot;,
p) it is coerced to e. Accordingly, (1) is given an
event reading, which, in this case, is associated with
two possible interpretations: &amp;quot;John began to read
the book&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;John began to write the book&amp;quot;.
This is an interesting way of looking at the phe-
nomenon, and typing certainly plays a crucial role
in building a coercion interpretation. However, the
hypothesis of type coercion itself is not supported
by linguistic evidence, and is not sufficiently con-
strained to account for the impossibility of some com-
binations. Instead of type change on the argument,
we propose an enrichment of the semantics of the
predicates which give rise to coercion interpretation.
Predicates may be finitely polymorphic; for instance,
begin combines with arguments of type p as well as
of type e. The correct interpretation is obtained at
the interpretive level, where it results both from gen-
eral processes and specific semantic properties of the
predicate. When begin has a complement of type

it, the interpretation makes use of a morphism be-
tween events and objects ([Krifka, 19921); this mor-
phism itself is not noted in the grammar, but the
result of its being resorted to can be noted, as well
as the semantic properties of the item commencer.
Thus, the phenomenon will be correctly expressed at
the lexical level. More precisely, we will use lexical
rules in the HPSG format ([Pollard and Sag, 1987;
Pollard and Sag, 1993]). We illustrate the phe-
nomenon in French and focus on the commencer (be-
gin) example, which is a very clear case of a pred-
icate allowing coercion interpretations. We provide
glosses, NOT English translations.

2.1 Preservation of the original type
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999927083333333">
Anaphora, relativization, and coordination are three
phenomena which involve identity of type. If the
coerced complement had acquired a new type, we
would expect it to behave like a phrase with this
new type. But it does not: le livre (the book) in
commencer le livre (to begin the book) has proper-
ties of phrases of type p, not of type e (the type of
entities with temporal constitution).
That the antecedent and the anaphoric NP must be-
long to the same type ([Milner, 1982]) is exemplified
below: an NP of type &amp;quot;individual&amp;quot; may not have a
type ic (the type of kinds) as its antecedent.

<bodyText confidence="0.9345805">

Quitter (to leave) takes a complement of type p, not
e: quitter la table vs *quitter sa lecture (to leave the
table, one&apos;s reading). Yet, the clitic complement of
quitter in (5) can have le livre, the coerced comple-
ment of commencer, as its antecedent.
(5) Jean a commence son livre a 10 heures et ne l&apos;a
pas quitte de la nuit.
John began his book at ten and did not leave it all night.
Conversely, the complement of arreter is of type e,
not p: arreter de lire, arreter sa lecture vs *arreter
un livre (to stop reading, one&apos;s reading, a book). It
usually takes a null complement anaphora, which can
refer to an event complement; it cannot refer to le
livre as complement of commencer.

Finally, it is well-known that conjoined categories
are of the same type: the violation of this require-

the predicate is certainly very strange, if the speaker
does not want to produce some stylistic effect.

2.2 Asymmetry between subjects and
objects
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997459111111111">
If coercion means type change operated by a predi-
cate on its arguments, it is difficult to see why it does
not apply to subjects in the same way as it does to
complements, with identical or closely related pred-
icates. Commencer, as an intransitive verb related
to transitive commencer, combines with subjects of
type e; thus, we would expect it to combine with co-
erced subjects having a different original type, but
this is not the case.

in fact there is little evidence of coercion sentences

<listItem confidence="0.829829">

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.993823272727273">
This class of verbs seems rather not to constrain the
types of the subject; even if paraphrases are taken to
be correct indications as to type, they cannot be used
to show that the subject of bores in (16) is coerced to
an event, since we have a series of acceptable para-
phrases for the subject like &amp;quot;her face, her chatter&amp;quot;,
as well as &amp;quot;listening to her, that she stays here&amp;quot;, etc.
Confirmation that psychological predicates are poly-
morphic as regards their cause argument is given by
the following coordination (cf. [Copestake and Bri-
scoe, 19911):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.907042">

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9981808">
If eat selects a p complement and enjoy coerces a p
complement to an e, then it is difficult to see how
they can share the same complement. The prob-
lem disappears if enjoy is dimorphic, and the type of
salmon is p.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998045">
2.3 Interpretation is not type changing
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998146">
The interpretive process which fills in information in
such cases as commencer le livre does not ENTAIL a
type change. This is shown by well—known examples
invoked by proponents of coercion, such as a long
book. While we agree that one reading for this NP
is &amp;quot;a book which it takes a long time to read&amp;quot; (see
[Briscoe et al., 1990]), it is clear that it is not associ-
ated with a phrase coerced to an event. Acheter does
not allow a complement of type e, while combining
easily with the above NP.

<bodyText confidence="0.999853333333333">
In the same way, the fact that the salmon in (17) is of
type p does not prevent the construction of the inter-
pretation &amp;quot;John ate the salmon and enjoyed eating
it&amp;quot;. Thus, one must find an account of the interpre-
tive phenomenon illustrated in (1) which does not
appeal to type change.

3 Properties of the phenomenon
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9643428">
There are three main properties which point towards
the desirability of a lexical treatment. (i) The phe-
nomenon is lexically driven rather than a general
process; (ii) for each lexical item, it is possible to ex-
press general constraints on interpretation; (iii) the
properties of the coerced complement which play a
crucial role in the acceptability of the construction
or on its range of interpretation are selected by the
predicate. The complement of commencer must be
(i) &amp;quot;bounded&amp;quot; and (ii) intentionally controlled.

<bodyText confidence="0.9836396875">
The notion of coercion owes much of its attractive-
ness to its potential generality: having a separate
general set of rules able to generate a set of accept-
able interpretations would significantly alleviate the
task of storing and handling semantic information.
This program, at least in this strong form, encoun-
ters empirical difficulties. For instance, it is not the
case that the class of aspectual verbs which subcate-
gorize for an NP of type e behaves uniformly. Com-
mencer, finir, se mettre a allow for coercion, but not
cesser or arreter.

3.2 Lexical information and paraphrase
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999985964285714">
A VP like commencer la salle de bains (to begin the
bathroom) can be understood as meaning, for exam-
ple, &amp;quot;to begin to build/to paint/to refurbish/to clean
the bathroom&amp;quot;. However, this does not imply that
such paraphrases should be present in the descrip-
tion of the V or the VP. It is clear that the events
denoted by these paraphrases share a feature: they
are all events of modification of the p complement, of
which they constitute a specification; it is this com-
mon interpretation which is part of the semantic con-
tent of the lexical item commencer. Thus, the rele-
vant distinction here is between abstract constraints,
which are part of the semantic content, and para-
phrases which exploit these constraints by checking
their consistency with additional information. An
abstract constraint for commencer, when it combines
with an argument of type p, is that the reconstructed
event should be some kind of modification.
The question whether the additional information,
from which the more specific paraphrase is con-
structed in a given linguistic and situational environ-
ment, is purely lexical, depends on world knowledge,
or has some intermediate status, is philosophically
and computationally important, but is not relevant
to the coercion problem. One could perfectly use
the qualia structure proposed by Pustejovsky ([1991])
and consider accordingly that bathroom is equipped
with a set of roles such as constitutive or formal roles,

<bodyText confidence="0.999333133333334">
The very possibility of a coercion construction de-
pends on the compatibility between semantic prop-
erties of the predicate and of the complement. Look-
ing more precisely at the case of commencer, we ob-
serve the following requirements on the complement:
the complement must refer to a &amp;quot;bounded&amp;quot; entity
as opposed to an &amp;quot;amorphous&amp;quot; one. The data are
the following. The complement of commencer is ei-
ther an infinitival VP or an NP denoting an event or
an object. In the latter case, partitives (with mass
nouns) or indefinite plurals (with count nouns) are
not allowed 1. Although it appears that NPs which
denote an event function in the same way as NPs
which denote objects, we will leave the event case
aside because of its complexity.

<bodyText confidence="0.999371860759494">
To account for (24)—(25), we propose that the par-
titive complement has the property of being amor-
phous, while the complement of commencer must be
bounded. We define this predicate using Krifka&apos;s
approach ([Krifka, 1992]) to the aspectual predicate
telic/atelic, whose relevance to linguistic phenomena
has been stressed by Vendler ([Vendler, 1967]). In-
tuitively, the idea is the following. All events have
a terminal point, but telic events (as well as objects
denoted by count constructions) have a set termi-
nal point, while atelic events (and objects denoted
by mass constructions) lack a set terminal point.
To this distinction, we add a new distinction be-
tween bounded entities, which have a terminal point,
and amorphous entities, which do not. Krifka de-
fines telic/atelic as a predicate of predicates; the lat-
ter have objects as well as events in their domains,
and, linguistically, they are nominal as well as ver-
bal predicates. In the same way we define amor-
phous/bounded as a predicate of predicates whose
domain comprises events as well as objects. But we
will not assume that nominal and verbal predicates
behave in a totally parallel fashion.
Let us first summarize Krifka&apos;s model and his defini-
tion of atelicity or strict cumulativity (str. cum.) and
telicity or quantization (qua). Let P be a predicate
defined on X, a complete join semi—lattice without
a bottom element, where X can be the domain of
events (E), or objects 0. The po C of the lattice is
viewed as a &amp;quot;part—of&amp;quot; relation. P is cumulative (wrt
X) if P holds for x U y whenever P holds for x and
y in X. A predicate is singular on X if it holds for
exactly one element of X. A predicate is str. cum.
when it is cumulative and not singular. A predicate
is qua. if, when it applies to x E X, it does not ap-
ply to any proper part of x. Let T be the domain of
times, and r an homomorphism E T preserving
U. The notion of terminal point of an event ( TP) is
defined by:
Ve, t(TP(e) = t (t E TA t C r(e) A WO&apos; C r(e)
t&apos; &lt;
A predicate has a set terminal point if, for any event
e to which it applies, any subevent of e to which it
applies has the same terminal point as e. Note that
all events have a terminal point (given by r), but only
a subclass of predicates, telic or qua. predicates, im-
pose a set terminal point to the events they denote.
Str. cum. predicates which apply to at least two dif-
ferent events with different terminal points have no
set terminal point. On the other hand, qua. predi-
cates have a set terminal point. Assuming that ver-
bal predicates like eat and nominal predicates like
bread are (strictly) cumulative, Krifka shows that
constructions like to eat bread are (strictly) cumula-
tive. On the other hand, constructions such as to
eat the bread, which use the qua. nominal predicate
the .bread, are demonstrably quantized. Such an ap-
proach accounts for well—known contrasts like to eat
bread for ten minutes/* in ten minutes vs to eat the
bread * for ten minutes/in ten minutes. Although
str. cum. characterizes French partitives and indef-
inite plurals, it appears that another distinction is
needed when one takes the full range of the comple-
ments of commencer into account. Such NPs corre-
spond to str. cum. predicates, since when they apply
to two objects or groups of objects they apply to
their join. Thus predicates such as manger du pain,
ecrire des livres are str. cum. , while manger le pain
and ecrire un livre are qua. . The contrast observed
in English translates directly into French (cf. [Bo-
rillo, 1989]): manger du pain pendant dix minutes/*
en dix minutes, ecrire des hares pendant plusieurs
annees/* en plusieurs annees vs manger le pain *
pendant dix minutes/en dix minutes, ecrire an livre
?? pendant une semaine2 /en une semaine.
Nevertheless, it would be wrong to use KrifIca&apos;s dis-
tinction to account for (24)—(25): commencer takes
VP complements which can be either str. cum. or
qua.

Thus, there is nothing in the meaning of commencer
which prevents its combining with str. cum. comple-
ments. We introduce an aspectual predicate labelled
&amp;quot;amorphous&amp;quot; (vs bounded). Amorphous entails str.
cum. ; bounded predicates may be either str. cum.
or qua.

AMORPHOUS BOUNDED

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999923769230769">
Intuitively, an event or an object are amorphous
when they have no temporal or spatial bounds, and
in particular no initial or terminal point. Although
amorphousness applies to both events and objects,
we need two different definitions. The intrinsic or-
dering relation (C or &amp;quot;part—of&amp;quot;) on the event domain
E is one—dimensional, so that the mapping to the
temporal linear order is straightforward. For objects
(most notably spatial objects) we must allow for an
indefinite number of dimensions.
Bounded events do not satisfy AMORPHOUS and
belong to the domain of the function TP. The con-
straint for events is as follows:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.921939666666667">
AMORPHOUS(P) Ve(P(e) = —,3t(t C r(e) A
((WV C r(e) = t &lt; t&apos;)) V ((Vt&apos;(/&apos; C r(e) = &apos; &lt;
t)))))
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.967998">
For a single object x, there are usually several ways
of &amp;quot;moving through&amp;quot; x, along different paths. For a
given path p the proper parts of x can be mutually
localized wrt a linear order &lt;,. This gives us a new
constraint for AMORPHOUS when P is applied to
objects:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.944945">
AMORPHOUS(P) Vx(P(x) C
x A Ox&amp;quot;(x&amp;quot; L x x&amp;quot; &lt;p )) V (dx&amp;quot;(x&amp;quot; C x
x&amp;quot;)))))
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.998977">
Linguistically, the predicate AMORPHOUS is as-
sociated with partitive and indefinite plural deter-
miners. It is interesting to note that such NPs have
a characteristic property: they may not occur as the
subjects of predication 3.

If there is no equivalent operator on verbal predi-
cates, it follows that they cannot be amorphous. If
additional evidence confirms this line of reasoning, it
suggests that, in spite of strong aspectual similarities
between verbal and nominal predicates (e.g. [Bach,
1986; Krifka, 19921), some important distinction(s)
must be made.
It is easy to see now why the meaning of commencer
requires that the complement be bounded. As a func-
tion on events, commencer returns the initial part of

part of any event which is associated with the ob-
ject by the interpretive procedure described in sec-
tion 4. This procedure exploits the fact that there
is a morphism between parts of objects and parts
of time, as noted in [Krifka, 1992]. It requires that
the beginning of the event correspond to the &amp;quot;ini-
tial&amp;quot; part with respect to some order, usually spa-
tial. Since amorphous objects have no initial part
the procedure fails, even if a plausible event has been
found (e.g. manger for commencer du fromage). For
each object x, we must have an event e and a path
p in x such that the models (OS, &lt;p) and (Te, &lt;),
where 00) and T. are the restrictions of 0 and T to
x and e, are isomorphic. Then (by basic model the-
ory) they are elementarily equivalent, and e satisfies
AMORPHOUS, which means that e has not initial
point and that first_part_of is undefined for e. It
follows that commencer cannot apply to amorphous
predicates, which lack any initial part.

The second constraint on the complement of com-
mencer in its coercion use is interpretive: the recon-
structed event is an event in which the object de-
noted by the NP is controlled by the entity denoted
by the subject of commencer. This results from two
factors: (i) the subject of commencer retains the in-
terpretation which it has when the complement is an
NP of type e, and (ii) there is nothing to construct
the event from, except the NP of type o itself.
The controller of an event is the entity which triggers
and causally maintains it (for a general analysis of
control, causality and related notions see [Brennen-
stuhl, 1982; Croft, 1991]). When the complement
NP denotes an event, the subject is an intentional
controller of the event, as the following observations
indicate. First, this NP must denote an event, that
is, an entity which allows for a controller: nomi-
nals denoting psychological states and properties are
excluded&apos;

Second, it is not enough that the subject denote the
initiator of the event, who simply triggers it, or the
inanimate cause. It must be a full—fledged inten-
tional controller. Thus (33) is not acceptable, since

Similarly, (35) is odd, although the acid is considered
as the cause of the event.
(35) * L&apos;acide a commence la destruction du marbre
The acid has begun the destruction of the marble
Furthermore, it is not enough that the subject be
the controller of some process related with the main
event. For instance, commencer la conference (to be-
gin the lecture) may not be understood as &amp;quot;to begin
to listen to the lecture&amp;quot;, it means &amp;quot;to begin to de-
liver the lecture&amp;quot;: listening to a lecture is an activity,
of which the agent may be said to be the controller,
but it does not causally impinge on the process of
lecturing itself. It should be noted that these re-
strictions do NOT characterize commencer when it
takes a verbal complement. The subject does not
have to be an intentional controller, and may even
be non—referential as in l&apos;acide a commence a atta-
quer (corrode) le marbre or il a commence ci pleuvoir
(it began to rain).
Turning now to the coercion interpretation, we see
that it is necessary, but not sufficient, to say that
the subject is interpreted as the controller of some
event in which the object is involved. For instance,
the two following interpretations are excluded:
(i) the interpretation in which the object undergoes a
change of position under the action of the controller:
commencer la pierre, la voiture (the stone, car) may
not mean &amp;quot;to begin to move the stone, to drive the
car&amp;quot;. Yet, moving an object and driving a car are
causal processes, causally controlled by human be-
ings.
(ii) The interpretation in which the subject changes
its position along a path denoted by the complement;
in Dowty&apos;s terms ([Dowty, 1991b, the complement
cannot be an &amp;quot;incremental path&amp;quot;: commencer le tun-
nel, le desert de Gobi (the tunnel, the desert of Gobi)
do not mean &amp;quot;to begin to go through the tunnel, the
desert of Gobi&amp;quot;.
Thus, it would be a mistake to simply state that
the reconstructed event is any event associated with
the object (as in the qualia structure for instance),
even adding the condition that the subject of com-
mencer must be a controller. The complement does
not get a default interpretation either. In this case
one would expect the patient interpretation, given
that the subject is a controller, which is a strong
form of agentivity. But the interpretations in (i) and
(ii) are instances of what Dowty calls the &amp;quot;proto—
patient&amp;quot; interpretation.
The requirement is stronger: not only must the sub-
ject be a controller of the event, it must control the
object itself. Driving a car, rolling a stone, going
through a tunnel, or crossing a desert do not af-
fect the object in any significant way. In fact this
requirement follows directly from the semantics of
commencer and the only information which is avail-
able, that is, the type of the object. The subject may
be a controller in an event thoroughly constructed
from an NP of type o only if it controls the object.
When this obtains, the event is in most cases a mod-
ification of the object. The object comes into be-
ing (commencer une maison = &amp;quot;to begin to build a
house&amp;quot;), is consumed (commencer le vin = &amp;quot;to begin
to drink the wine&amp;quot;), or undergoes a definite change
of state (commencer la salle de bains = &amp;quot;to begin
to paint/clean the bathroom&amp;quot;). In other words, we
accept that the information associated with the lex-
ical items in the qualia structure helps to specify
the interpretation in a given context, as mentionned
above, but it does not contribute to the semantics of
the construction itself. The only information which
contributes to the semantics is borne by the lexical
iten commencer: (i) commencer is a &amp;quot;function&amp;quot; which
applies to an event and returns its initial part, (ii)
the subject of commencer with an NP complement is
the controller of the event, (iii) the event is denoted
by the complement e or constructed by isomorphism
from the complement o. However, there is a class
of objects which seem to raise difficulties. We have
considered material objects; there are also objects
which me may call informational, and which occur
as complements of commencer. At first sight, their
interpretation does not involve a modification. Such
are a book, a list, a story, a student&apos;s paper, a mag-
azine, a listing, etc. Consider (1) again. As noted in
[Pustejovsky, 1991] commencer le livre/to begin the
book does not only mean &amp;quot;to begin to write the book&amp;quot;
but also &amp;quot;to begin to read the book&amp;quot;, an activity
which is not immediately seen as an event of modifi-
cation of the book. This example contrasts with com-
mencer une symphonie/to begin a symphony which
may mean &amp;quot;to begin to compose/perform a sym-
phony&amp;quot;, not to &amp;quot;to begin to listen to a symphony&amp;quot;.
The problem is the following: why does the book al-
low the interpretation &amp;quot;to read&amp;quot; while the symphony
does not allow the interpretation &amp;quot;to listen&amp;quot;? We
propose that in fact &amp;quot;to read a book&amp;quot; is a modifica-
tion of the book while &amp;quot;to listen to a symphony&amp;quot; is
not a modification of the symphony: there is no par-
allelism between reading and listening. Reading is a
process by which the reader interprets an organized
sequence of signs, thus adding to the material object
a new informational layer. This layer does not exist
independently of the reading operation, which is to-
tally controlled by the reader. On the other hand,
listening does not modify the music: musical sounds
are not signs, they are stimuli, i.e. they provoke re-
actions but are not systematically associated with
information according to some definite set of rules
(at least in our culture). The difference between ma-
terial modification and informational modification is
that in the first case the result is objectivized, while
it is internal in the latter.

4 Lexical descriptions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9992890625">
Our treatment is twofold. On one hand, we propose
lexical descriptions in accordance with the preceding
analysis, which do not use type change and contain
an abstract pattern, allowing for coercion interpre-
tation. On the other hand, we must make sure that
our approach meets basic requirements of computa-
tional tasks. Coercion phenomena can raise prob-
lems for understanding or generation systems, since
they need to interpolate predicates to issue correct
interpretations or syntactic forms ([Gerstl, 1992]).
An understanding system should be able to interpret
a sentence like Jean prit ses pinceaux et commenca
la porte (John took his paint—brushes and began the
door) as &amp;quot;John took his brushes and began to paint
the door&amp;quot;. Similarly, a generation system should be
able to contract commencer a lire le km into com-
mencer le livre.
We will briefly address here the problem of match-
ing potential paraphrases with a phrase of form com-
mencer + NP. For instance, a sound system should
accept to match commencer la porte and commencer
peindre la porte (to paint the door), while it should
forbid the pairing of commencer le telephone with
commencer a utiliser le telephone (to begin to use
the telephone). Our pairing system will use the type
constraints present in the descriptions of the lexical
items which allow for coercion interpretation, and
supposes that the candidate verbs are already there.
A more ambitious system would start from a phrase
commencer+ NP and retrieve all the candidate verbs
(e.g. the candidate phrase peindre from the phrase
commencer la porte).

In this structure the atomic arguments of relations

atomic types and E be the set of boolean or func-
tional (-0) combinations of elements of EAT; we use
x a, where a E E to say that any value of x must
be of type a (other notations would use x°). We will
suppose that we have at our disposal a boolean lat-

As shown in section 3.3, commencer with a coerced

Here modify is intended to mean any sort of internal
and durable change affecting the object (thus redec-
orating and refurbishing a house are modifications,
but not hanging up a picture or moving a heavy piece
of furniture). Sequential accounts for the contrast
between commencer un livre (book) vs *commencer
un plan (map) in pattern 3 (it may mean &amp;quot;to begin
to draw a map&amp;quot; not &amp;quot;to read a map&amp;quot;).
It should be noted that we do not equate the mean-
ing of commencer with the function first_part_of
(AzIP(x)), which is in fact only an element of it.
The notion of type change relies partly on a more di-
rect association between a lexical item and a typed
function. Instead of changing the argument type,

we enrich the semantic structure associated with the
predicate itself. This solution is in the same spirit
as that proposed by [Pollard and Sag, 1993] to treat
a similar problem concerning the control interpreta-
tion in infinitival complement sentences.
Pattern 4 is an instance of commencer2. As in the
preceding case, the meaning of commencer is a com-
plex structure, but the value of ARG2 is not itself
complex, and the type of ARG1 subsumes the type
of ARG2. This is necessary since the value of the
function first_part_of is identified with the value of
ARG1.

4.2 The matching procedure

if the values of RELN, ARG1&apos;, ARG2&apos; for H1 and
those of RELN, ARG1, ARG2 for H2 unify respec-
tively for some given pattern. Consider the H2 for
peindre.

In this case, since human &lt; animate, the unifica-
tion succeeds for pattern 2. It would fail in the
case of diplacer ( move) which has a RELN slot
deplacer I (control A intentional A —&apos;modify).
One cannot reasonably suppose that we have lexi-
cons containing the right information at our disposal.
The importance of enriching the semantic structure
for exploiting on—line information has been rightly
emphasized in [Anick and Bergler, 1991] and [Puste-
jovsky et al., 1992]. Unfortunately, it seems difficult
to exactly parallel the techniques decribed there, be-
cause they have been devised mainly for nouns and
adjectives. Consider the entry chambre (room) in a
medium size French dictionary OM, 1987]): for the
current meaning corresponding to bedroom, the def-
inition is pice oil l&apos;on couche (a room where one
sleeps). The entry for ranger (to tidy) mentions
ranger sa chambre as an illustration of the mean-
ing mettre/remettre de l&apos;ordre dans un lieu (to put a
place in order). So the verb ranger, which is a good
candidate for matching, is available from the dictio-
nary itself. However, this is only one facet of the
information which is necessary to control the match-
ing efficiently: we need to know that ranger has the
correct feature modify, to put it in the matchers
set, and that chambre is not an info (to avoid to
put coucher dans in the matchers set). Let us sup-
pose that the second problem is resolved simply &amp;quot;by
failure&amp;quot;, i.e. by failing to find any relevant connec-
tion with terms which exhibit the info feature. The
first problem would get a satisfying solution if we
could put mettre de l&apos;ordre dans un lieu into corre-
spondence with a structure as the following:
</bodyText>
<table confidence="0.942938909090909">
of_type (ACTION, act ion1)
ACTOR (act ion1, i) PATIENT (act ion1, j)
CONTENT (act ion1, contro11)

CONTROLLED (contro11, trans it ion1)

STARTS (trans it ion1, stat el)
ENDS (trans ition1, state2)
of_type(STATE,statel) of_type(STATE,state2)
CARRIER(statel,j) CARRIER(state2,j)
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.998813956521739">
This in turn would require that we link mettre de
l&apos;ordre (&amp;quot;put ... in order&amp;quot;) with an action of control
over a transition from a state (of disorder) to a new
one (order). The carrier of these states would be
the relevant place (a bedroom in our example). It
is not clear how this information could be extracted
from standard dictionaries in this case. Other cases,
where classifiers are present in the definition, seem
more amenable to general procedures of extraction.
Such difficulties are lucidly acknowledged and com-
mented upon in [Pustejovsky et al., 1992]. Since
accessing the needed feature is unrealistic in some
cases, a natural question is whether we can resort to
other strategies. We note that the features combina-
tions are few, which allows to list some of the verbs
and nouns which exhibit them, and to check whether
a given verb is an hyperonym of some member in the
list. A temptative list for commencer is:
Verbs = (consommer, ranger, construire, detruire,
reparer, lire, interpreter, executer, creer)
Nouns = (nourriture, boisson, lute, lieu, appareil,
biiiiment, ceuvre, matiere)
Starting from a pair (commencer + NP, V) we may
obtain a first rough diagnosis by searching the Verbs
and Nouns lists for NP and V, or hyperonyms of
them, as indicated in dictionaries like [du Chaz-
aud, 1989; Delay and Demon, 1989]. This simple
test would capture normal matchings, such as (com-
mencer le charbon (coal), briller (to burn)). This is
because briiler is is an hyperonym of consornmer (to
consume) in [du Chazaud, 1989]. If the procedure is
sensitive to simple preferences, it should dismiss de-
viant pairs as (commencer le charbon (coal), manger
(to eat)).
Yet, it would not filter out abnormal candidates
as (commencer le charbon (coal), ranger (to tidy)).
There is no preference violation, since it is perfectly
possible to put some heap of coal in the right place.
The problems stems from the violation of the se-
mantics for modification mentionned in our previ-
ous analysis: moving an object does not count as
an internal change. Thus, it is necessary to capture
the relevant features at the level of pairs of elements
of Verbs and Nouns. In this case ranger should be
paired with lieu (place). This agrees with the fact
that baiments (buildings), which are hyponyms of
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.94961676">
lieu can be tidied up.
We propose the following pairing for the sake of il-
lustration (we do not take it to be the one and true
pairing):
consommer nourriture, boisson, matiere
ranger lieu
cons truire, detruire appareil, lieu
reparer, nettoyer
lire, interpreter texte
executer, crier m uvre
Odd examples like commencer une symphonic, with
the &amp;quot;begin to listen to&amp;quot; interpretation, will be ex-
cluded if symphonie is classified as an hyponym of
ceuvre (work). On the other hand the interpreta-
tion &amp;quot;begin to play&amp;quot; will be accepted if jouer (to
play) is related to executer (to perform). Thesauri
are usually better tools than synonyms dictionaries
for checking the existence of such connections. E.g.
[Delos and Demon, 1989] allows the following path:
symphonic musique = jouer.
Such examples point to the desirability of exploiting
existing thesauri. However, a good deal of restruc-
turing will be necessary to exploit them in a prin-
cipled way. This is a general problem which is far
beyond the limits of this paper.

Let us briefly consider the interpretation of the nomi-
nal complement of apres (after), ignoring cases where
this complement is simply an event (this is the stan-
dard temporal case), and cases of parallelism, where
the NP complement is understood as sharing with
an NP in the S the same predicate and the same ar-
gument slot wrt this predicate6.

As with commencer, the interpretation of the com-
plement is an event, whose predicate is not to be
found in the context. The predicates which are ex-
cluded with commencer are equally impossible or
clumsy here. The NP is not simply understood as
a proto-patient:

In fact, the only possible predicates point to bringing
an object into existence or to making it disappear.
Furthermore, the connection between the two events
is not strictly temporal: succession is not enough
to make coercion acceptable: eventl (reconstructed
from the NP) must be understood as the cause of
event2 (denoted by the S):

<bodyText confidence="0.999185705882353">
While it is generally held that natural langage pro-
cessing can only benefit from taking into account
&amp;quot;non literal&amp;quot; meaning, i.e. phenomena pertaining
to metaphor, metonymy, and coercion, there is no
agreement on the best way to attack them. We have
addressed here the problem of coercion, which seems
to entail a &amp;quot;strong&amp;quot; type shift (from o to e), while
metonymy is more properly analyzed as a codified
facet shift inside complex structures, and metaphor is
generally conceived as based over analogy. The very
nature of coercion phenomena suggests that tasks
such as studying types hierarchies and methods for
positioning lexical items in these hierarchies are pre-
requisites for an acceptable treatment. It is likely
that the use of thesauri, and more generally of lex-
ical descriptive tools, will prove helpful. Our future
research is oriented in this direction. We do not ex-

<abstract confidence="0.999476041666667">The interpretation of coercion construcbegin a book) been recently considered as resulting from the operation of type changing. For instance, a phrase of is coerced to a phrase of type e (event) under the influence of the predicate. We show that this procedure encounters empirical difficulties. Focussing on the we show that the coercion interpretation results both from general semantic processes and properties of the predicate, and we argue that it is best represented at the lexical level. The solution is formulated in the HPSG formalism, where the lexical description of heads includes a specification of the argument and articulates syntax and semantics. We propose that the properties attached to the complement remain the same as they are oustside the construction, but that the semantics of the predicate is enriched to include an abstract predicate of which the complement is an argument.</abstract>
