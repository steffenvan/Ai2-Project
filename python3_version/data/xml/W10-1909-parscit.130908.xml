Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.99362659375">
Here we explore mining data on gene expres-
sion from the biomedical literature and
present Gene Expression Text Miner
(GETM), a tool for extraction of information
about the expression of genes and their ana-
tomical locations from text. Provided with
recognized gene mentions, GETM identifies
mentions of anatomical locations and cell
lines, and extracts text passages where au-
thors discuss the expression of a particular
gene in specific anatomical locations or cell
lines. This enables the automatic construction
of expression profiles for both genes and ana-
tomical locations. Evaluated against a ma-
nually extended version of the BioNLP &apos;09
corpus, GETM achieved precision and recall
levels of 58.8% and 23.8%, respectively. Ap-
plication of GETM to MEDLINE and
PubMed Central yielded over 700,000 gene
expression mentions. This data set may be
queried through a web interface, and should
prove useful not only for researchers who are
interested in the developmental regulation of
specific genes of interest, but also for data-
base curators aiming to create structured re-
positories of gene expression information.
The compiled tool, its source code, the ma-
nually annotated evaluation corpus and a
search query interface to the data set ex-
tracted from MEDLINE and PubMed Cen-
tral is available at http://getm-

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999865595238095">
With almost 2000 articles being published daily
in 2009, the amount of available research litera-
ture in the biomedical domain is increasing ra-
pidly. Currently, MEDLINE contains reference
records for almost 20 million articles (with about
10 million abstracts), and PubMed Central
(PMC) contains almost two million full-text ar-
ticles. These resources store an enormous wealth
of information, but are proving increasingly dif-
ficult to navigate and interpret. This is true both
for researchers seeking information on a particu-
lar subject and for database curators aiming to
collect and annotate information in a structured
manner.
Text-mining tools aim to alleviate this prob-
lem by extracting structured information from
unstructured text. Considerable attention has
been given to some areas in text-mining, such as
recognizing named entities (e.g. species, genes
and drugs) (Rebholz-Schuhmann et al., 2007;
Hakenberg et al., 2008; Gerner et al., 2010) and
extracting molecular relationships, e.g. protein-
protein interactions (Donaldson et al., 2003;
Plake et al., 2006; Chowdhary et al., 2009).
Many other areas of text mining in the biomedi-
cal domain are less mature, including the extrac-
tion of information about the expression of genes
(Kim et al., 2009). The literature contains a large
amount of information about where and when
genes are expressed, as knowledge about the ex-
pression of a gene is critical for understanding its
function and has therefore often been reported as
part of gene studies. Gene expression profiles
from genome-wide studies are available in spe-
cialized databases such as the NCBI Gene Ex-
pression Omnibus (Barrett et al., 2009) and
FlyAtlas (Chintapalli et al., 2007), but results on
gene expression from smaller studies remain
locked in the primary literature.
Previously, a number of data-mining projects
have combined text-mining methods with struc-
tured genome-wide gene expression data in order

to allow further interpretation of the gene expres-
sion data (Natarajan et al., 2006; Fundel, 2007).
However, only recently has interest in text-
mining tools aimed at extracting gene expression
profiles from primary literature started to grow.
The 2009 BioNLP shared task (Kim et al., 2009)
aimed at extracting biological &amp;quot;events&amp;quot;, where
one of the event types was gene expression. For
this event type, participants were asked to deter-
mine locations in text documents where authors
discussed the expression of a gene or protein and
extract a trigger keyword (e.g. &amp;quot;expression&amp;quot;) and
its associated gene participant (the gene whose
expression is discussed). The group that achieved
the highest accuracy on the &amp;quot;simple event&amp;quot; task
(where gene expression extraction was included)
achieved recall and precision levels of 64.2% and
77.5%, respectively (Björne et al., 2009). A key
limitation of the 2009 shared task was that all
genes had been annotated prior to the beginning
of the task, making it difficult to anticipate the
accuracy of tools that do not rely on pre-
annotated entities.
Biologists are interested not only in finding
statements of gene expression events, but also in
knowing where and when a gene is expressed.
However, to the best of our knowledge, no effort
has previously been made to extract and map the
expression of genes to specific tissues and cell
types (and vice versa) from the literature. Thus,
we have taken preliminary steps to construct a
software tool, named Gene Expression Text
Miner (GETM), capable of extracting informa-
tion about what genes are expressed and where
they are expressed. An additional goal of this
work is to apply this tool to the whole of MED-
LINE and PMC, and make both the tool and the
extracted data available to researchers.
We anticipate that the data extracted by
GETM will provide researchers an overview
about where a specific gene is expressed, or what
genes are expressed in a specific anatomical lo-
cation. Moreover, GETM will aid in the curation
of gene expression databases by providing text
passages and identifiers to database curators for
verification.

2 Methods
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999973307692308">
An overview of the workflow of GETM is given
in Figure 1. Articles are initially scanned for
mentions of gene entities, anatomical entities and
keywords indicating the discussion of gene ex-
pression (called triggers following BioNLP ter-
minology, e.g. &amp;quot;expression&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;expressed in&amp;quot;).
After the detection of the entities and triggers,
abbreviations are detected and entities are
grouped in the cases of enumerations. Finally,
sentences are split and each sentence is
processed in order to associate triggers with gene
and anatomical entities. Each step is described
below in more detail.

2.1 Named entity recognition and abbrevia-
tion detection
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999924">
In order to extract information on the expression
of genes and their anatomical locations, a key
requirement is the accurate recognition and nor-
malization (mapping the recognized terms to da-
tabase identifiers) of both the genes and anatom-
ical locations in question. In order to locate and
identify gene names, we utilized GNAT (Haken-
berg et al., 2008), an inter-species gene name
recognition software package. Among the gene
name recognition tools capable of gene normali-
zation, GNAT is currently showing the best ac-
curacy (compared to the BioCreative corpora
(Hirschman et al., 2005; Morgan et al., 2008)).
The species identification component of GNAT,
used to help disambiguate gene mentions across
species, was performed by LINNAEUS (Gerner
et al., 2010).
In order to perform named entity recognition
(NER) of anatomical locations, we investigated
the use of various anatomical ontologies. A key
challenge with these ontologies is that the terms

vary significantly from one species to another.
For example, fruit flies have wings while humans
do not, and humans have fingers, while fruit flies
do not. Efforts have been made in creating uni-
fied species-independent anatomical ontologies,
such as Uberon (Haendel et al., 2009; Mungall et
al., 2010). However, in preliminary experiments
we found that the coverage of Uberon was not
extensive enough for this particular application
(data not shown), motivating us to instead use a
combination of various species-specific anatomi-
cal ontologies hosted at the OBO Foundry
(Smith et al., 2007). These ontologies (n = 13)
were chosen in order to cover terms from the
main model organisms that are used in research
(e.g. human, fruit fly, mouse, Caenorhabditis
elegans) and a few larger groups of organisms
such as e.g. amphibians and fungi. It is worth
noting that the more general terms, such as e.g.
&amp;quot;brain&amp;quot;, are likely to match anatomical locations
in other species as well. In total, the selected on-
tologies contain terms for 38,459 different ana-
tomical locations.
We also utilized an ontology of cell lines
(Romano et al., 2009), containing terms for a
total of 8,408 cell lines (ranging across 60 spe-
cies), as cell lines can be viewed as biological
proxies for the anatomical locations that gave
rise to them. For example, the HeLa cell line was
derived from human cervical cells, and the THP1
cell line was derived from human monocytes
(Romano et al., 2009).
The anatomical and cell line NER, utilizing
the OBO Foundry and cell line ontologies, was
performed using dictionary-matching methods
similar to those employed by LINNAEUS
(Gerner et al., 2010).
After performing gene and anatomical NER
on the document, abbreviations were detected
(using the algorithm by Schwartz and Hearst
(2003)) in order to allow the detection and mar-
kup of abbreviated entity names in the cases
where the abbreviations do not exist in any of the
ontologies that are used.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.994292">
2.2 Trigger detection
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999451541666667">
The trigger keywords indicating that an author is
discussing the expression of one or several
genes, such as e.g. &amp;quot;expression&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;expressed
in&amp;quot; were detected using a manually created list of
regular expressions. The regular expressions
were designed to match variations of a set of
terms, listed below, that were identified when
inspecting documents not used when building the
gold-standard corpus (see Section 3.1).
The terms used to construct the trigger regular
expressions were orthographical, morphological
and derivational variations of &amp;quot;expression&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;pro-
duction&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;transcription&amp;quot;. Descriptions of the
level of expression were also considered for the
different terms, such as &amp;quot;over-expression,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;un-
der-expression,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;positively expressed,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;nega-
tively expressed,&amp;quot; etc.
Each gene expression mention that has been
extracted by GETM contains information about
the trigger term used by the author, allowing re-
searchers to look only at e.g. the &amp;quot;negative&amp;quot; men-
tions (where genes are e.g. &amp;quot;under-expressed&amp;quot; or
&amp;quot;negatively expressed&amp;quot;) or the &amp;quot;positive&amp;quot; men-
tions (where genes are e.g. &amp;quot;over-expressed&amp;quot;).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999914">
2.3 Association of entities to the trigger
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999563642857143">
To help associate triggers with the correct gene
and anatomical entities, articles were first split
into sentences, allowing each sentence to be
processed in turn. In order to reduce the number
of false positives and preserve a high level of
precision, any sentences that did not contain a
trigger, at least one gene mention and at least one
anatomical mention were ignored. For the sen-
tences that did contain a combination of all three
requirements (trigger, gene and anatomical men-
tion), the following pattern- and distance-based
rules were employed in order to associate each
trigger with the correct gene and anatomical
mention:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.99800845">
1. If there is only one gene mention and only
one anatomical mention in the sentence, the
trigger is associated with those mentions.
2. If there is one gene mention (G) and one
anatomical mention (A) in the sentence
such that they match one of the patterns
&amp;quot;&lt;G&gt; is expressed in &lt;A&gt;&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;expression of
&lt;G&gt; in &lt;A&gt;&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;&lt;A&gt; transcribes &lt;G&gt;&amp;quot; or
&amp;quot;&lt;A&gt; produces &lt;G&gt;&amp;quot;, the gene mention
&lt;G&gt; and anatomical mention &lt;A&gt; are asso-
ciated with the trigger (variations of the
triggers, such as &amp;quot;over-expressed&amp;quot; and
&amp;quot;negative expression&amp;quot; are considered as
well). Additional gene or anatomical men-
tions that fall outside the pattern are ig-
nored.
3. If neither of the above rules applies, the
trigger is associated with the gene and ana-
tomical mentions that are closest to the trig-
ger.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.988369">
For the purposes of these rules, an enumera-
tion of several genes or anatomical locations was
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.9999571">
handled as if it was only a single mention. For
example, Rule 1 might trigger even if there are
several genes mentioned in the same sentence, as
long as they are mentioned together as part of an
enumeration.
In order to detect these enumerations, a rule-
based algorithm for connecting enumerated gene
and anatomical entity mentions (as in e.g. &amp;quot;...
RelB and DC-CK1 gene expression ...&amp;quot;) was also
implemented. Being able to detect enumerations
allowed the rules described above to recognize
that a particular gene expression mention do not
refer to only e.g. &amp;quot;RelB&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;DC-CK1&amp;quot;, but both
of them at the same time.
Each trigger was processed independently, al-
lowing the potential extraction of multiple gene
expression statements from a single sentence.
Initially, experiments were performed using
stricter rules where only variations of Rule 2,
requiring gene and anatomical mentions to con-
form to certain patterns, were used. However,
recall was in these cases found to be extremely
low (below 5%, data not shown). The current
rules are more permissive, allowing higher recall.
The fact that the method requires a combina-
tion of a trigger, a gene and an anatomical loca-
tion makes it susceptible to false negatives: if
any one of them cannot be found by the NER or
trigger detection methods, the whole combina-
tion is missed.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.9581605">
3.1 Extending the BioNLP shared task
gold-standard corpus
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999982875">
In order to make a meaningful evaluation of the
accuracy of text-mining applications, a gold-
standard corpus, consisting of manually anno-
tated mentions for a set of documents, is re-
quired. Previously, no such corpus existed that
was suitable for this problem (providing annota-
tions linked to mentions of both gene and ana-
tomical locations). However, the BioNLP corpus
(Ohta et al., 2009) which is based on the GENIA
corpus (Kim et al., 2008), does contain annota-
tions about gene expression. Annotations in the
corpus contain trigger terms that are linked to
genes (or gene products) where the authors dis-
cuss gene expression. However, anatomical loca-
tions have not been annotated in this corpus.
In order to allow evaluation of the accuracy of
our software, we extended the annotations of
gene expression events in part of the BioNLP
corpus. Each gene expression entry in the corpus
was linked to the anatomical location or cell line
that the author mentioned. In cases where gene
expression was only discussed generally without
referring to expression in a particular location, no
association to an anatomical location could be
made (these entries were ignored during evalua-
tion). Note that named entities were only linked
to their locations in the text, not to unique data-
base identifiers (such as Entrez Gene or OBO
Foundry identifiers). Because of this, subsequent
evaluation in this extended corpus is limited to
the accuracy of recognition (locating the entities
in the text), but not normalization (linking the
entities to database identifiers).
In total, annotations for 150 abstracts (consti-
tuting the development set of the BioNLP cor-
pus) were extended to also include anatomical
locations. These abstracts contained 377 anno-
tated gene expression events, of which 267
(71%) could be linked to anatomical locations.
These results demonstrate that the majority of
gene expression mentions include reference to an
anatomical location. For a few cases where the
author described the expression of a gene in sev-
eral cell types, a single gene expression event
gave rise to several distinct &amp;quot;entries&amp;quot; in the ex-
tended corpus, creating a total of 279 final gene
expression entries that are linked to anatomical
locations.

In order to evaluate the accuracy of GETM, it
was first run on the 150 abstracts in the gold-

MEDLINE and PMC, in order to extract a sear-

The gene expression mentions extracted by

we noted that a number of the false positives ac-

and had been marked as false positives only be-
cause of incomplete annotations in the corpus.
Because of this, all false positives were manually

number of false positives. For one of the cor-

4.2 Analysis of false negatives
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999647642857143">
In order to determine the causes of the relatively
high number of false negatives, the gene entities,
anatomical entities and triggers identified by
GNAT and GETM were compared to the ex-
tended corpus, allowing us to determine the
number of corpus entities that could not be found
by the GNAT and GETM NER tools. An analy-
sis was also performed in order to determine the
number of corpus entries that were spread across
several sentences, as any expression mentions
spread over several sentences are missed by
GETM.
The analysis results can be seen in Table 2,
showing that virtually all false negatives are
caused either by incomplete NER or multi-
sentence entries. Only considering the NER, 68%
of the gold-standard corpus annotated entries
contain either a trigger (example FN: &amp;quot;detected&amp;quot;),
gene (example FN: CD4) or anatomical location
(example FN: &amp;quot;lymphoblastoid cells&amp;quot;) that could
not be located automatically. GETM was further
limited by entities being spread across several
sentences (n=66, 23.6%). In total, 74.3% of all
entries could not be extracted correctly due to
either incomplete NER, incomplete trigger detec-
tion or the entities being spread across multiple
sentences. This limited recall to 25.7%, even if
the rule-based method was working perfectly.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.995826">
4.3 Analysis of false positives
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999996230769231">
Manual inspection of the false positives (after
adjusting the false positives caused by incom-
plete annotations) allowed the identification of
one clear cause: if the NER methods fail to rec-
ognize the entity associated with a manually an-
notated expression entry, but there are other enti-
ties (that have been recognized) in the sentence,
those entities might be incorrectly associated
with the trigger instead. For example, in the sen-
tence &amp;quot;In conclusion, these data show that IL-10
induces c-fos expression in human B-cells by
activation of tyrosine and serine/threonine kinas-
es.&amp;quot; (Bonig et al., 1996) (the correct entities and
trigger are italicized), a correctly extracted entry
would link c-fos to B-cells through the trigger
expression. However, the gene NER component
failed to recognize c-fos but did recognize IL-10,
causing GETM to incorrectly associate IL-10
with B-cells. Either increasing the accuracy of
the NER methods or performing deeper gram-
matical parsing could potentially reduce the
number of false positives of this type. We note
that the number of cases for this category (n =
15; 34%) only make up a minority of the total
number of false positives, and the remainder
have no easily identifiable common cause.

statements were extracted, not counting the ab-
stracts in MEDLINE that also appear in PMC.
Overall, the combined extracted information
ranges across 25,525 different genes (the most
common being tumor necrosis factor (TNF su-
perfamily, member 2) in human) and 3,655 dif-
ferent anatomical locations (the most common
being T cells). The most common combination
concerns the expression of human interleukin 2
in T cells. The 10 most commonly mentioned
combinations of genes and anatomical locations
are shown in Table 3. Overall, these results sug-
gest that studies on gene expression in the field
of mammalian immunology are the dominant
signal in MEDLINE and PMC. The genes that
were recognized and normalized range across 15
species, out of the 23 supported by GNAT (Ha-
kenberg et al., 2008). The most common species
is human, as expected (Gerner et al., 2010), fol-
lowed by mouse, rat, chicken and cow.
The majority of statements were associated to
anatomical locations from the OBO Foundry on-
tologies (n=649,819; 89.7%), while the remaind-
er were associated to cell lines (n=74,294;
10.3%). This result demonstrates the importance
of taking cell lines into account when attempting
to identify anatomical entities.
Finally, a total of 73,721 (11.7%) of the state-
ments extracted from MEDLINE contained ei-
ther genes or anatomical locations that had been
enumerated by the author, underscoring the im-
portance of considering enumerations when de-
signing text-mining algorithms.

5.1 Overview of design philosophy
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999965">
When constructing text-mining applications, a
balance between precision (reflecting the relative
number of false positives) and recall (reflecting
the relative number of false negatives) is often
used to optimize system performance. Accor-
dingly, a measure which often is used to evaluate
the accuracy of software is the F-score (the har-
monic mean of the precision and recall). In this
work, we have decided that rather than trying to
maximize the F-score, we have put more focus
on precision in order to ensure that the data ex-
tracted by GETM are of as high quality as possi-
ble. This typically leads to lower recall, causing
the software to detect a relatively smaller number
of relevant passages. Nonetheless, we believe
that for this particular application, a smaller
amount of data with higher quality would be
more useful to curators and biologists than a
larger amount of data that is less reliable.

5.2 Comparison with previous work

<bodyText confidence="0.999983461538462">
It is difficult to compare the precision and recall
levels of GETM (at 58.8% and 23.8%, respec-
tively) against other tools, as GETM is the first
tool aiming to perform this particular task. The
closest comparison that can be made is against
the software evaluated in the BioNLP shared task
(Kim et al., 2009). However, software developed
for the BioNLP shared task did not attempt to
extract the anatomical location of gene expres-
sion mentions, nor did they need to identify the
component entities involved. The tool with the
highest accuracy for the simple event task (where
gene expression extraction was included) showed

precision and recall levels of 77.5% and 64.2%,
respectively (Björne et al., 2009). It is not clear
how tools evaluated in the 2009 BioNLP shared
task would perform if they identified entities
themselves rather than using pre-annotated enti-
ties.

5.3 Limits on accuracy
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999978804347826">
When investigating the cause of the low level of
recall, the main reason that emerged for the high
number of false negatives was the high number
of annotated entries that could not be automati-
cally extracted due to at least one of the gene,
anatomical or trigger mentions not being recog-
nized. This fact underscores the importance of
accurate NER for applications that rely on the
extracted entity mentions, especially those that
attempt to extract information from multiple enti-
ty types, like GETM. The results also demon-
strate that NER, particularly in the case of gene
name normalization, continues to pose a chal-
lenging problem. It is possible that using a com-
bination of GNAT and other gene NER tools
would improve the overall gene NER accuracy.
We further explored the effects of &amp;quot;perfect&amp;quot;
gene NER on the accuracy of GETM by using
the manual gene mention annotations supplied in
the BioNLP corpus. Using the pre-annotated
gene names increased the number of gene ex-
pression mentions recognized and the number of
true positives, significantly improving recall
(from 23.8% to 37.8%; data not shown). Howev-
er, a number of additional false positives were
also introduced, causing precision to decrease
very slightly from 58.8% to 58.5% (data not
shown). This demonstrates the complexity of
gene expression mentions in text, indicating that
a combination of accurate trigger detection, ac-
curate NER (for both genes and anatomical loca-
tions) and deeper NLP methods are needed in
order to accurately capture gene expression pro-
files in text.
A secondary cause of false negatives was a
relatively high number of annotated corpus en-
tries that spanned several sentences. The high
proportion (23%) of multi-sentence entries in our
extended corpus differs from previously reported
results. For the event annotations in the BioNLP
corpus, previous analyses showed that only 5%
of all entries spanned several sentences (Björne
et al., 2009). This suggests that the mentions of
anatomical locations are located outside of the
&amp;quot;trigger sentence&amp;quot; more often than gene mentions
or other entities in the BioNLP corpus.

6 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999991641509434">
In this paper, we have explored integrated min-
ing of gene expression mentions and their ana-
tomical locations from the literature and pre-
sented a new tool, GETM, which can be used to
extract information about the expression of genes
and where they are expressed from biomedical
text. We have also extended part of a previously
existing gold-standard corpus in order to allow
evaluation of GETM. When evaluated against
the gold-standard corpus, GETM performed with
precision and recall levels of 58.8% and 23.8%,
respectively.
The relatively low level of recall was primari-
ly caused by incomplete recognition of individu-
al entities, indicating that – in order to increase
the recall of GETM – future work would primari-
ly need to focus on increasing the accuracy of the
NER methods. With more accurate NER, while
increasing recall, the higher number of recog-
nized entities is also expected to increase the
number of false positives, causing a need for
deeper NLP methods in order to preserve and
increase the level of precision.
While having a low level of recall, GETM was
nonetheless able to extract 716,541 statements
from MEDLINE and PMC, constituting a large
and potentially useful data set for researchers
wishing to get an overview of gene expression
for a particular gene or anatomical location. The
high number of mentions extracted from MED-
LINE can give an indication of the amount of
data available in MEDLINE: if the recall on the
BioNLP corpus is representative for MEDLINE
as a whole, a tool with perfect accuracy might be
able to extract almost 2.5 million entries.
The level of precision (p = 58.8%) will most
likely not be high enough for researchers to rely
on the extracted data for high-throughput bioin-
formatical experiments without some kind of
verification. However, we believe that it none-
theless will be of high enough quality that re-
searchers and curators will not feel inconve-
nienced by false positives, as currently the only
alternatives are multi-word free text searches
through PubMed or Google. Additionally, we
provide an interface with the text context sur-
rounding gene expression statements, making it
easier for researchers to quickly locate relevant
results.
In the future, we will aim to evaluate the nor-
malization of entities detected by GETM in order
to quantify the level to which the identifiers as-
signed to the entities are correct. In addition,

both the gene and anatomical NER components
could be improved in order to both reduce the
number of false negatives and cover gene and
anatomical terms for a wider range of species,
beyond the common model organisms. We also
believe that extending this work by utilizing dee-
per NLP methods (e.g. dependency parsers)
could further improve the accuracy of GETM
and related approaches to mining the abundance
of data on gene expression in the biomedical lite-
rature.

<abstract confidence="0.988831696969697">Here we explore mining data on gene expression from the biomedical literature and present Gene Expression Text Miner (GETM), a tool for extraction of information about the expression of genes and their anatomical locations from text. Provided with recognized gene mentions, GETM identifies mentions of anatomical locations and cell lines, and extracts text passages where authors discuss the expression of a particular gene in specific anatomical locations or cell lines. This enables the automatic construction of expression profiles for both genes and anatomical locations. Evaluated against a manually extended version of the BioNLP &apos;09 corpus, GETM achieved precision and recall levels of 58.8% and 23.8%, respectively. Application of GETM to MEDLINE and PubMed Central yielded over 700,000 gene expression mentions. This data set may be queried through a web interface, and should prove useful not only for researchers who are interested in the developmental regulation of specific genes of interest, but also for database curators aiming to create structured repositories of gene expression information.

We also utilized an ontology of cell lines (Romano et al., 2009), containing terms for a total of 8,408 cell lines (ranging across 60 species), as cell lines can be viewed as biological proxies for the anatomical locations that gave rise to them. For example, the HeLa cell line was derived from human cervical cells, and the THP1 cell line was derived from human monocytes (Romano et al., 2009). The anatomical and cell line NER, utilizing the OBO Foundry and cell line ontologies, was performed using dictionary-matching methods similar to those employed by LINNAEUS (Gerner et al., 2010). After performing gene and anatomical NER on the document, abbreviations were detected (using the algorithm by Schwartz and Hearst (2003)) in order to allow the detection and markup of abbreviated entity names in the cases where the abbreviations do not exist in any of the ontologies that are used. 2.2 Trigger detection The trigger keywords indicating that an author is discussing the expression of one or several genes, such as e.g. &amp;quot;expression&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;expressed in&amp;quot; were detected using a manually created list of regular expressions.

Overall, these results suggest that studies on gene expression in the field of mammalian immunology are the dominant signal in MEDLINE and PMC. The genes that were recognized and normalized range across 15 species, out of the 23 supported by GNAT (Hakenberg et al., 2008).

The closest comparison that can be made is against the software evaluated in the BioNLP shared task (Kim et al., 2009). However, software developed for the BioNLP shared task did not attempt to extract the anatomical location of gene expression mentions, nor did they need to identify the component entities involved. The tool with the highest accuracy for the simple event task (where gene expression extraction was included) showed 77 precision and recall levels of 77.5% and 64.2%, respectively (Björne et al., 2009). It is not clear how tools evaluated in the 2009 BioNLP shared task would perform if they identified entities themselves rather than using pre-annotated entities. 5.3 Limits on accuracy When investi</context>

Previously, no such corpus existed that was suitable for this problem (providing annotations linked to mentions of both gene and anatomical locations). However, the BioNLP corpus (Ohta et al., 2009) which is based on the GENIA corpus (Kim et al., 2008), does contain annotations about gene expression. Annotations in the corpus contain trigger terms that are linked to genes (or gene products) where the authors discuss gene expression. However, anatomical locations have not been annotated in this corpus. In order to allow evaluation of the accuracy of our software, we extended the annotations of gene expression events in part of the BioNLP corpus.

Efforts have been made in creating unified species-independent anatomical ontologies, such as Uberon (Haendel et al., 2009; Mungall et al., 2010). However, in preliminary experiments we found that the coverage of Uberon was not extensive enough for this particular application (data not shown), motivating us to instead use a combination of various species-specific anatomical ontologies hosted at the OBO Foundry (Smith et al., 2007). These ontologies (n = 13) were chosen in order to cover terms from the main model organisms that are used in research (e.g. human, fruit fly, mouse, Caenorhabditis elegans) and a few larger groups of organisms such as e.g. amphibians and fungi.

Previously, no such corpus existed that was suitable for this problem (providing annotations linked to mentions of both gene and anatomical locations). However, the BioNLP corpus (Ohta et al., 2009) which is based on the GENIA corpus (Kim et al., 2008), does contain annotations about gene expression. Annotations in the corpus contain trigger terms that are linked to genes (or gene products) where the authors discuss gene expression. However, anatomical locations have not been annotated in this corpus. In order to allow evaluation of the accuracy of our software, we extended the annotations of gene expression events in part of the BioNLP corpus. Each gene expression entry in the corpus was linked to the anatomical location or cell line that the author mentioned. In cases where gene expres</context>
