Many of the purported demonstrations of the non-CF-ness
of various languages that have appeared over the past
twenty-five years (reviewed in Pullum and, Gazdar 1982)
have been replete with both mathematical errors and
empirical shortcomings.&apos; In the wake of the renewed inter-
est in the parsability of natural languages sparked by the
work of Gerald Gazdar and others (see Gazdar 1981,
1982), it has become somewhat more important to
linguists to attempt to determine at least whether English
— the most studied language in the era of generative gram-
mar and the primary focus for natural language processing
efforts — is context-free (CF) or not. The availability of a
vast fund of information about efficient parsing of CF
languages (CFLs) that could in principle be put to work on
parsing English is enticing, and the idea that English and
other natural languages might be a small proper subset of
such a constrained and mathematically well-understood
proper subset of the recursively enumerable sets is highly
appealing. Chomsky (1981: 233-234) has denied this, but
the denial is something of a volte face, for in an earlier
publication (1974: 48) he remarked:
. . . the theory of phrase structure grammar (PSG) was
methodologically preferable to transformation grammar
(TG) . . . . PSG is both simpler, more homogeneous, and
more restrictive, narrower in the range of permitted gram-
mars, than TO.
Among those who believe that English does not in fact
lie within the CFLs, greater effort has recently been put
into searching for subsets of English that appear to show
crucially non-CF properties, and the mathematical work
needed to support an argument for non-CF-ness has been
conducted with much greater rigor than heretofore. Two
entirely new arguments on the topic have recently
appeared: one by Postal and Langendoen (in this issue)
and one by Higginbotham (1984). In both, the mathemat-
ical side of the argument seems sound, great care having
been taken to present all the necessary steps in the proof
offered. In this paper, I shall briefly examine the claims
they make. My conclusion with regard to each is that they
fail to make their case- because closer attention reveals that
their empirical claims about English are incorrect. More-
over, both arguments concern anaphora, and both fail in
ways related to that concern.

The capitalization indicates contrastive stress on which,

(the sense suggests that, in &apos;transformational terms, an
additional clause Joe discussed has been &amp;quot;sluiced&amp;quot; away
from the position following which Y). P&amp;L&apos;s claim is that,

I I am grateful to Barbara Partee and Ray Perrault for useful discussions,
and to Terry Langendoen and Paul Postal for providing me with a copy of
their paper before its publication.
2 They continue to be cited and elaborated upon nonetheless, and state-
ments still standardly appear in the literature of linguistics to the effect
that context-free parsing cannot be used for natural languages; see Rich
(183: 314-315) for yet another recent example. Gazdar (1983) provides
a literature review of the topic.
3 A refinement of the context of discussion which I will ignore here is that
these authors have argued that natural languages contain sentences of
infinite length (e.g., infinite coordinations, see Langendoen and Postal
(1984)), which means they are not recursively enumerable, and not even
sets. From this perspective, the present discussion concerns those proper
subparts of natural languages that contain just finite-length sentences.

<bodyText confidence="0.93017570967742">
If this is true, and if the set of compound nouns such as
bourbon-lover-hater (hater of those who love bourbon),
bourbon-lover-hater-hater (hater of those who hate bour-
bon lovers), and so forth, is infinite (which seems reason-
able to me), then, as they show, there is a simple argument
from intersection with a regular set to obtain a string
copying (xx) language, and the conclusion is that English
is not CF.
The flaw in this argument is subtle, and has to do with
the relation between sentence syntax and discourse struc-
ture. Note first that the &amp;quot;Sluicing&amp;quot; construction illus-
trated by sentences like Joe discussed some bourbon-lover
but I don&apos;t know which bourbon lover is not exclusively
intrasentential. Dialogs like the following are encount-
ered:
2A: Joe has been blaming the fracas last night on a
certain well-known bourbon-lover.
B: Oh really? I can&apos;t imagine WHICH bourbon-lover.
Notice that in such discourses, B can interpolate addi-
tional sentences before the one containing the
which-phrase, provided the thread of the anaphoric
connection is not thereby made opaque:
3A: Joe has been blaming the fracas last night on a
certain well-known bourbon-lover.
B: Oh really? You surprise me. I can&apos;t guess WHICH
bourbon-lover.
Now notice that the interpolated material may even be
conjoined on the beginning of the clause containing the
anaphoric which:
4A: Joe has been blaming the fracas last night on a
certain well-known bourbon-lover.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.452">
B: Oh really? I&apos;m fairly well acquainted with the people
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.976420648648649">
involved, but I can&apos;t guess WHICH bourbon-lover.
This possibility spells the downfall of the empirical side of
P&amp;L&apos;s argument. By careful context construction, we can
get extremely close to a legitimate context of use for exact-
ly the sort of sentences that they rule out. Consider this
discourse:
5A: It looks like they&apos;re going to appoint another bour-
bon-hater as Chair of the Liquor Purchasing
Committee.
B: Yes—even though Joe nominated some bourbon-lov-
ers; but WHICH bourbon-hater is still unknown.
The approach is close enough for the failure of the argu-
ment to be clearly seen; it is permissible for the antecedent
of the anaphorically de-stressed constituent in a
construction of this type to be in a previous sentence in the
discourse, and for the anaphor relation to hold across an
intervening conjunct with arbitrary content. There is no
reason in principle why a clause like which bourbon-hater
is unknown should not have a conjoined clause like Joe
discussed some bourbon-lover intervening between it and
the antecedent for its anaphoric reference, and the same
holds for all other choices of compound noun. The syntax
of English does not demand that the immediately preced-
ing clause contain the antecedent for the anaphoric
relationship that holds here, any more than it demands
that the most recent noun phrase in the current sentence
should be the antecedent for a pronoun — notice that she
can mean Julia in a discourse like (6):
6. I&apos;ve decided to appoint Julia. Mary wanted me to
choose Kathy, but I&apos;m sticking by my decision. She&apos;ll
do a great job.
Hence sentences on the pattern
Joe discussed some X but WHICH Y is unknown.
are grammatical whether X matches Y or not (though if
not, then Y will not be taken as anaphorically related to X
in this construction). This means that P&amp;L have no argu-
ment for the non-CF-ness of English.

2. Higginbotham on such that clauses
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.955559692307693">
Higginbotham (1984) argues that English can be shown to
be non-CF on the basis of the such that relative clause
construction. This type of clause, he claims, is constrained
to contain a pronoun anaphorically bound to the head.
Thus he regards phrases as the woman such that she left as
grammatical, but the man such that I saw Mary as
ungrammatical. Because of this, he reasons, the inter-
section of the regular language
L = the woman such that (the man such that)* she
(gave (this + him) to (this + him))* left is here
with English is the following language, to be referred to as
A:
{the woman such that (the man such that) n she
((gave him to him) + (gave him to this) + (gave this
to him) + (gave this to this)) n left is here I n &gt; 0,
and, reading from left to right, the number of occur-
rences of this never exceeds by more than 1 the
number of occurrences of him&apos;
This is shown to be non-CF by a direct application of
Ogden&apos;s Lemma, hence showing that English is non-CF.
Higginbotham approaches his task with much more
rigor and detail than has been customary in the linguistic
literature. But as with the P&amp;L argument, the flaws lie in
Computational Linguistics, Volume 10, Numbers 3-4, July-December 1984 183
Geoffrey K. Pullum On Two Recent Attempts to Show that English Is Not a CFL
the attention to detailed description of English, and more-
over, relate to the treatment of anaphora. In
Higginbotham&apos;s argument, it is crucial that English allows
as a noun phrase any string of the form
the N such that z
where &amp;quot;z is an ordinary English declarative sentence that
contains an occurrence of a third-person pronoun that does
not have to be taken as having its antecedent within z&amp;quot; and
&amp;quot;N is any noun that agrees properly with the pronoun in
number and gender&amp;quot;. But it also crucial that only if there
is such an unbound and properly agreeing pronoun in z is
the string a grammatical noun phrase. The latter assump-
tion is plainly false. Consider this example:
7. Over many years, it has become clear that Lee and
Sandy were just one of those couples such that people
always reported loving her but hating him.
This contains a noun phrase of the form &amp;quot;Det . . . N such
that z&amp;quot; where z contains no pronoun bound to the head
noun (couples); yet it seems fully grammatical.
In Pullum (forthcoming) I give many more examples,
varying the head nouns through a considerable range. I
will not repeat all of them here, but lest anyone should
think that I am using solely my own judgments here as the
crucial evidence in a case of disputed data, let me point
out that examples of the relevant sort can be adduced from
the written English of other speakers through the written
history of English. For example, a colleague found the
following sentence in a manuscript under anonymous
review for publication:
8. Modern linguistic theory makes crucial use of gram-
matical categories like &apos;verb&apos;, &apos;noun&apos;, &apos;subject&apos;, and
&apos;object&apos;, such that theories of universal grammar refer
to languages as being SvO, VSO, SOV, etc.
And in the prose of 0.0. Trevelyan (1876: 137) one may
find the following very stylish example:
9. On the 20th of February the House of Commons was
called upon to express its gratitude to the Governor-
General; and a debate ensued, in which the speeches
from the front Opposition bench were as good as could
be made by statesmen, who had assumed an attitude
such that they could not very well avoid being either
insincere or ungracious.
There is no pronoun referring back to the head noun atti-
tude here, so it does not conform to the constraint that is
crucial to Higginbotham&apos;s argument.
Surprisingly, Higginbotham knows that sentences of
this general sort exist, for he sites the following two noun
phrases in his first footnote:
10a. every triangle such that two sides are equal
b. the number system such that 2 and 3 make 5
and addresses the issue of how they are to be distinguished
from examples he counts as ill-formed, such as
Ila. every book such that it rains
b. the man such that I saw Mary
He considers but dismisses the possibility that &amp;quot;all of these
examples are grammatical NPs, although [those in (11)]
are not interpretable in any natural way, perhaps owing to
the irrelevance of the sentence following &apos;such that&apos; to the
content of the head noun&amp;quot;. His argument is as follows.
First, the sentence following &apos;such that&apos;, even in cases like
[those in (10)], is in fact never interpreted as closed; rath-
er, it is interpreted, where possible, as elliptical for a
sentence that is not merely relevant to the content of the
head noun, but further supplies a place into which binding
is possible. Thus, [(10a) and (10b)] are intuitively taken
as elliptical for (iii) and (iv), respectively:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.883540333333333">
(iii) every triangle such that two sides of it are equal
(iv) the number system such that 2 and 3 make 5
therein
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.969510384615385">
Their mode of interpretation, then, not only is consistent
with, but further supports, the premise employed in this
article.
Higginbotham is apparently committed to the view that
any sentence violating his alleged constraint will be purely
an elliptical version of a longer one that observes it by
virtue of containing a prepositional phrase with a pronomi-
nal NP that acts as a bound variable. But with examples I
have cited, it does not even seem possible to insert extra
prepositional phrases to force them to have the bound vari-
able pronouns that Higginbotham&apos;s generalization
demands.
Moreover, even if it were possible to embellish these
examples with prepositional phrases to carry bound vari-
able pronouns, this would be irrelevant to the matter at
hand, since the claim at issue is about sets of strings, not
their interpretations. The claim that the sentences are
&amp;quot;taken as elliptical&amp;quot; is completely irrelevant. They are no
more elliptical than Kennedy was assassinated, which lacks
an agentive phrase by someone which semantically we
might argue to be &amp;quot;taken&amp;quot; to be there.
Higginbotham goes on to remark that
... there is nothing semantically odd about sentences that
use NPs of the sort shown in [(11)]; for instance, (v),
whose subject is [(11a)], would, if grammatical, be
logically equivalent to (vi):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.847691">
(v) every book such that it rains is on the table
(vi) either every book is on the table, or it does not rain
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998267">
Hence the elliptical character of [(10)], and similar exam-
ples, is a fact of grammar, for which the alternative
suggestion provides no explanation.
Here Higginbotham recognized that there is no principle
of logic that dictates uninterpretability, even for the
bizarre cases in (11). We can assume that a noun like
book denotes a set and a such that clause attached to it to
make an NI denotes a condition that has to be satisfied by
elements of the denoted set if they are to qualify as
members of the denotation of the N&apos;. In a bizarre case like

<bodyText confidence="0.999691043478261">
(11a), the condition, if true, does not restrict the deno-
tation of the head noun at all. In a less bizarre case like
the woman such that she left, if the pronoun she is bound to
the head noun woman. only a woman who left can belong
to the denotation of the phrase woman such that she left.
In interesting cases such as (10a), the condition is vague:
two sides are equal could be true in many ways (the trian-
gle is isosceles; the triangle is equilateral; the triangle is
scalene but two sides of a previously mentioned quadrila-
teral are equal; the two sides in a recently discussed hock-
ey game are equal in their scores; and so on). Naturally,
some of these are much more likely and plausible than
others in typical contexts, but clearly the vacuous-condi-
tion interpretations are consistent with the more likely
ones.
In the most interesting cases, those like (7), the such
that clause suggests a constraint on the denotation set of
the head noun without explicitly giving it in the syntax. In
couple such that people always report loving her but hating
him, the such that clause refers to a lovable female and a
detestable male but does not specify grammatical roles for
these individuals exterior to the clause. The pair are
referred to, however, in a such that clause attached to the
noun couple, which, pragmatically, provides us with an
inferred him and her to allow for the interpretation of the
such that clause people always report loving her but hating
him as a restriction on the reference of the noun couple.
There is no plausibility to an account that forces this prag-
matic fact into the syntax by postulating an abstract
prepositional phrase to contain a suitable bound variable
(*couple such that people always report loving her but
hating him [of it/them]). And even if there were, this
would not bear on establishing the non-CF-ness of English
given that the phrase in question is not required to appear
in the string. Higginbotham is exactly right about the
semantically unexceptional character of the cases in which
the such that clause fails to restrict the denotation set of
the head noun other than trivially, but that is precisely
what shows he is wrong about the grammatical basis of the
restriction condition.
Higginbotham&apos;s argument fails, then, because, given
the evidence above that such that clauses do not have to
contain pronouns bound to their heads, we can see that the
condition regarding the relative numbers of occurrences of
the words him and this in set A does not have to be met by
members of the regular set L in order for them to qualify
for inclusion within English. English contains not only
strings like (12a) but also strings like (12b).
12a. The man such that the man such that she gave this
to him gave him to this left.
b. The man such that the man such that she gave this
to him gave this to this left.
Both of these, being double center-embedded, are prohib-
itively hard to process or to contextualize, of course, but
we do not operate in such matters by attempting to render
naive judgments of acceptability on extreme cases. Rath-
er, given a clear picture of what generalizations are opera-
tive in more natural cases, we apply the familiar
methodology of generative grammar and extend those
generalizations to the cases where unaided intuition would
fail.
If the count of him instances relative to this instances
does not have to be maintained, then plainly there is no
proof of non-CF-ness, since a context-free grammar is
readily able to keep track of the number of the man such
that sequences relative to the number of gave NP to NP
sequences. It is only the additional burden of keeping the
him/this count that allows for a proof that A is non-CF
and thus that English is.

3. Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999057057142857">
I think there are lessons to be learned from this admittedly
negative review. It is clear that linguists have not
succeeded in developing strong and predictive theories of
what belongs to the domain of syntax and what belongs to
semantics. Rather than attempting to discern the status of
each new fact as it becomes crucial to some dispute, we
ought to be developing general theories of language from
which the correct conclusions follow in a principled way.
Notice, in the present context, that both the arguments I
have reviewed relate to the topic of anaphora. In both
cases, I have presented evidence against the assumption
that certain anaphoric elements are syntactically
constrained to be identical and clausally adjacent to their
antecedents (section 1) or to be present in the string
(section 2). I suspect that it is generally true that
anaphoric devices that can be controlled across sentence
boundaries in discourse are never subject to any intrasen-
tential constraint on identity or overt presence. As things
stand, however, this is nothing more than a hunch. One
conclusion we can draw from the present discussion is that
we are in need of a general and widely accepted theory of
the syntax and semantics of anaphoric devices.4
A second conclusion I would draw is that it is time to
start applying to semantically interpreted linguistic
systems the kind of mathematical analysis that so far is
mostly conducted with regard to stringsets. We know
little about what mathematical or computation power is
inherent in particular systems that do not merely generate
sets of strings but pair strings with representations of
meanings that are appropriate to particular situations.&apos; It
would be useful to have more clear results about combined
syntactic and semantic systems, since no one doubts that it
is the entire mapping between structure and meaning that
linguists are ultimately interested in. Moreover, it has
been argued fairly convincingly that some natural

result, observed by Len Schubert: the set of sentences assigned deno-

and Marsh (1984), stimulated by Higginbotham&apos;s paper, discuss a prob-
lem that has potential relevance here. They note that the set of predicate
calculus formulae with no vacuous quantification is not a CFL, and
conjecture (but are not able to prove) that it is not even an indexed
language.

languages cannot be described by a CF grammar in a
manner that allows a suitable syntax-to-semantics
mapping to be defined (see Bresnan, Kaplan, Peters, and
Zaenen (1982) on Dutch).6
6Shieber (in press), which I saw in a preliminary version after complet-
ing this paper but have not seen in its final form at the time of going to
press, extends the result about Dutch to make a much stronger claim
about a related language, Swiss German, namely that it has a syntactic
analog of the Dutch pattern and overall is not even CF. Moreover,
Culy (in press) also has evidence of a natural language (Bambara,
spoken in West Africa) that appears to be other than CF. This changes
the background to the current dispute a lot, of course. If Shieber and
Culy are right, there are some aspects of the syntax of some natural
languages that call for parsing by a device with greater than CF power.
What I have said above about English remains true, of course, but
although there may be general facts about how anaphora works that
could have enabled us to predict this, we cannot predict it simply from
the proposition that universal grammar does not allow supra-CF gram-
mars. This makes me much less confident about being able to answer
the rejoinder to this article that Langendoen and Postal publish in this
issue. Although their facts, which I saw just as this article went to
press, are not totally convincing (because the repeated-head-noun
appositive relative construction they discuss is so awkward and unna-
tural even at the best of times), I now do not see why in principle they
might not be right. Perhaps I have been speaking and writing a non-CF
language all these years, and simply hadn&apos;t realized it, like Moliere&apos;s M.
Jourdain, who didn&apos;t realize he had native competence in prose.

The availability of a vast fund of information about efficient parsing of CF languages (CFLs) that could in principle be put to work on parsing English is enticing, and the idea that English and other natural languages might be a small proper subset of such a constrained and mathematically well-understood proper subset of the recursively enumerable sets is highly appealing. Chomsky (1981: 233-234) has denied this, but denial is something of a face, in an earlier publication (1974: 48) he remarked: . . theory of phrase structure grammar (PSG) was methodologically preferable to transformation grammar (TG) . . . . PSG is both simpler, more homogeneous, and narrower in the range of permitted grammars, than TO. Among those who believe that English does not in fact lie within the CFLs, greater effort has recently been put into searching for subsets of English that appear to show crucially non-CF properties, and the mathematical work needed to support an argument for non-CF-ness has been conducted with much greater rigor than heretofore. Two entirely new arguments on the topic have recently appeared: one by Postal and Langendoen (in this issue) and one by Higginbotham (1984). In both, the mathematical side of the argument seems sound, great care having been taken to present all the necessary steps in the proof offered. In this paper, I shall briefly examine the claims they make. My conclusion with regard to each is that they to make their because closer attention reveals that their empirical claims about English are incorrect. Moreover, both arguments concern anaphora, and both fail in ways related to that concern. 1. Postal and Langendoen on Sluicing Clauses Postal and Langendoen (henceforth P&amp;L) argue as follows.&apos; Consider the class of English sentences meeting the schema discussed some WHICH unknown. capitalization indicates contrastive stress on and Y is anaphorically de-stressed by virtue of reference to examples are called &amp;quot;Sluicing&amp;quot; sentences (the sense suggests that, in &apos;transformational terms, an clause discussed been &amp;quot;sluiced&amp;quot; away the position following Y). claim is that, if this schema is filled out with English compound nouns from the regular set II am grateful to Barbara Partee and Ray Perrault for useful discussions, and to Terry Langendoen and Paul Postal for providing me with a copy of their paper before its publication. 2They continue to be cited and elaborated upon nonetheless, and statements still standardly appear in the literature of linguistics to the effect that context-free parsing cannot be used for natural languages; see Rich (183: 314-315) for yet another recent example. Gazdar (1983) provides a literature review of the topic. 3A refinement of the context of discussion which I will ignore here is that these authors have argued that natural languages contain sentences of infinite length (e.g., infinite coordinations, see Langendoen and Postal (1984)), which means they are not recursively enumerable, and not even sets. From this perspective, the present discussion concerns those proper subparts of natural languages that contain just finite-length sentences. by the Association for Computational Linguistics.

Pullum On Two Recent Attempts to Show that English Is Not a CFL bourbon (hater + lover)* the positions Y, a sentence will be obtained if and if an exact string match obtains between Y That is, strings like (la) are grammatical but those like are not, according to discussed some bourbon-lover-hater but bourbon-lover-hater is unknown. *Joe discussed some bourbon-lover hater but bourbon-lover-lover is unknown. If this is true, and if the set of compound nouns such as of those who love bourbon), of those who hate bourbon lovers), and so forth, is infinite (which seems reasonable to me), then, as they show, there is a simple argument from intersection with a regular set to obtain a string copying (xx) language, and the conclusion is that English is not CF. The flaw in this argument is subtle, and has to do with the relation between sentence syntax and discourse structure. Note first that the &amp;quot;Sluicing&amp;quot; construction illusby sentences like discussed some bourbon-lover know which bourbon lover not exclusively intrasentential. Dialogs like the following are encountered: 2A: Joe has been blaming the fracas last night on a certain well-known bourbon-lover. Oh really? I can&apos;t imagine Notice that in such discourses, B can interpolate additional sentences before the one containing the which-phrase, provided the thread of the anaphoric connection is not thereby made opaque: 3A: Joe has been blaming the fracas last night on a certain well-known bourbon-lover. Oh really? You surprise me. I can&apos;t guess bourbon-lover. Now notice that the interpolated material may even be conjoined on the beginning of the clause containing the 4A: Joe has been blaming the fracas last night on a certain well-known bourbon-lover. B: Oh really? I&apos;m fairly well acquainted with the people but I can&apos;t guess This possibility spells the downfall of the empirical side of P&amp;L&apos;s argument. By careful context construction, we can get extremely close to a legitimate context of use for exactly the sort of sentences that they rule out. Consider this discourse: 5A: It looks like they&apos;re going to appoint another bourbon-hater as Chair of the Liquor Purchasing Committee. B: Yes—even though Joe nominated some bourbon-lovbut is still unknown. The approach is close enough for the failure of the argument to be clearly seen; it is permissible for the antecedent of the anaphorically de-stressed constituent in a construction of this type to be in a previous sentence in the discourse, and for the anaphor relation to hold across an intervening conjunct with arbitrary content. There is no in principle why a clause like bourbon-hater unknown not have a conjoined clause like some bourbon-lover between it and the antecedent for its anaphoric reference, and the same holds for all other choices of compound noun. The syntax of English does not demand that the immediately preceding clause contain the antecedent for the anaphoric relationship that holds here, any more than it demands that the most recent noun phrase in the current sentence be the antecedent for a pronoun — notice that mean a discourse like (6): 6. I&apos;ve decided to appoint Julia. Mary wanted me to choose Kathy, but I&apos;m sticking by my decision. She&apos;ll do a great job. Hence sentences on the pattern discussed some is unknown. grammatical whether Y or not (though if then Y will not be taken as anaphorically related to this construction). This means that have no arguthe English. Higginbotham on that Higginbotham (1984) argues that English can be shown to the basis of the that clause construction. This type of clause, he claims, is constrained to contain a pronoun anaphorically bound to the head. he regards phrases as woman such that she left but man such that Mary ungrammatical. Because of this, he reasons, the intersection of the regular language = woman such that (the man such that)* (gave (this + him) to (this + him))* left is here with English is the following language, to be referred to as A: woman such that (the man such that) nshe ((gave him to him) + (gave him to this) + (gave this him) + (gave this to this)) nleft is here I n &gt; 0, and, reading from left to right, the number of occurrences of this never exceeds by more than 1 the number of occurrences of him&apos; This is shown to be non-CF by a direct application of Lemma, hence showing that English is Higginbotham approaches his task with much more rigor and detail than has been customary in the linguistic But as with the the flaws lie in Linguistics, Volume 10, Numbers 3-4, July-December 1984 Geoffrey K. Pullum On Two Recent Attempts to Show that English Is Not a CFL attention to detailed description of English, and moreover, relate to the treatment of anaphora. Higginbotham&apos;s argument, it is crucial that English allows as a noun phrase any string of the form that an ordinary English declarative sentence that contains an occurrence of a third-person pronoun that does have to be taken as having its antecedent within any noun that agrees properly with the pronoun in and gender&amp;quot;. But it also crucial that there such an unbound and properly agreeing pronoun in the string a grammatical noun phrase. The latter assumption is plainly false. Consider this example: 7. Over many years, it has become clear that Lee and Sandy were just one of those couples such that people always reported loving her but hating him. contains a noun phrase of the form &amp;quot;Det . . . N z&amp;quot; no pronoun bound to the head it seems fully grammatical. In Pullum (forthcoming) I give many more examples, varying the head nouns through a considerable range. I will not repeat all of them here, but lest anyone should think that I am using solely my own judgments here as the crucial evidence in a case of disputed data, let me point out that examples of the relevant sort can be adduced from the written English of other speakers through the written history of English. For example, a colleague found the following sentence in a manuscript under anonymous review for publication: 8. Modern linguistic theory makes crucial use of grammatical categories like &apos;verb&apos;, &apos;noun&apos;, &apos;subject&apos;, and &apos;object&apos;, such that theories of universal grammar refer to languages as being SvO, VSO, SOV, etc. And in the prose of 0.0. Trevelyan (1876: 137) one may find the following very stylish example: 9. On the 20th of February the House of Commons was called upon to express its gratitude to the Governor- General; and a debate ensued, in which the speeches from the front Opposition bench were as good as could be made by statesmen, who had assumed an attitude such that they could not very well avoid being either insincere or ungracious. is no pronoun referring back to the head noun attiso it does not conform to the constraint that is crucial to Higginbotham&apos;s argument. Surprisingly, Higginbotham knows that sentences of this general sort exist, for he sites the following two noun phrases in his first footnote: 10a. every triangle such that two sides are equal b. the number system such that 2 and 3 make 5 and addresses the issue of how they are to be distinguished from examples he counts as ill-formed, such as Ila. every book such that it rains b. the man such that I saw Mary He considers but dismisses the possibility that &amp;quot;all of these are grammatical [those in (11)] are not interpretable in any natural way, perhaps owing to the irrelevance of the sentence following &apos;such that&apos; to the content of the head noun&amp;quot;. His argument is as follows. First, the sentence following &apos;such that&apos;, even in cases like in (10)], is in fact as closed; rather, it is interpreted, where possible, as elliptical for a sentence that is not merely relevant to the content of the head noun, but further supplies a place into which binding is possible. Thus, [(10a) and (10b)] are intuitively taken as elliptical for (iii) and (iv), respectively: every triangle such that two sides it equal (iv) the number system such that 2 and 3 make 5 therein Their mode of interpretation, then, not only is consistent with, but further supports, the premise employed in this article. Higginbotham is apparently committed to the view that any sentence violating his alleged constraint will be purely an elliptical version of a longer one that observes it by virtue of containing a prepositional phrase with a pronomiacts as a bound variable. But with examples I have cited, it does not even seem possible to insert extra prepositional phrases to force them to have the bound variable pronouns that Higginbotham&apos;s generalization demands. Moreover, even if it were possible to embellish these examples with prepositional phrases to carry bound variable pronouns, this would be irrelevant to the matter at hand, since the claim at issue is about sets of strings, not their interpretations. The claim that the sentences are &amp;quot;taken as elliptical&amp;quot; is completely irrelevant. They are no elliptical than was assassinated, lacks agentive phrase someone semantically we might argue to be &amp;quot;taken&amp;quot; to be there. Higginbotham goes on to remark that is nothing semantically odd about sentences that use NPs of the sort shown in [(11)]; for instance, (v), whose subject is [(11a)], would, if grammatical, be logically equivalent to (vi): (v) every book such that it rains is on the table (vi) either every book is on the table, or it does not rain Hence the elliptical character of [(10)], and similar examples, is a fact of grammar, for which the alternative suggestion provides no explanation. Here Higginbotham recognized that there is no principle of logic that dictates uninterpretability, even for the bizarre cases in (11). We can assume that a noun like a set and a that attached to it to an denotes a condition that has to be satisfied by elements of the denoted set if they are to qualify as members of the denotation of the N&apos;. In a bizarre case like Linguistics, Volume 10, Numbers 3-4, July-December 1984 Geoffrey K. Pullum On Two Recent Attempts to Show that English Is Not a CFL (11a), the condition, if true, does not restrict the denotation of the head noun at all. In a less bizarre case like woman such that she left, the pronoun bound to head noun a woman who left can belong the denotation of the phrase such that she left. In interesting cases such as (10a), the condition is vague: sides are equal be true in many ways (the triangle is isosceles; the triangle is equilateral; the triangle is scalene but two sides of a previously mentioned quadrilateral are equal; the two sides in a recently discussed hockey game are equal in their scores; and so on). Naturally, some of these are much more likely and plausible than others in typical contexts, but clearly the vacuous-condition interpretations are consistent with the more likely ones. the most interesting cases, those like (7), the suggests a constraint on the denotation set of the head noun without explicitly giving it in the syntax. In couple such that people always report loving her but hating that refers to a lovable female and a detestable male but does not specify grammatical roles for these individuals exterior to the clause. The pair are to, however, in a that attached to the pragmatically, provides us with an inferred him and her to allow for the interpretation of the that always report loving her but hating a restriction on the reference of the noun There is no plausibility to an account that forces this pragmatic fact into the syntax by postulating an abstract prepositional phrase to contain a suitable bound variable (*couple such that people always report loving her but him [of it/them]). even if there were, this would not bear on establishing the non-CF-ness of English given that the phrase in question is not required to appear in the string. Higginbotham is exactly right about the semantically unexceptional character of the cases in which that fails to restrict the denotation set of the head noun other than trivially, but that is precisely what shows he is wrong about the grammatical basis of the restriction condition. Higginbotham&apos;s argument fails, then, because, given evidence above that that do not have to contain pronouns bound to their heads, we can see that the condition regarding the relative numbers of occurrences of words set not have to be met by of the regular set order for them to qualify for inclusion within English. English contains not only strings like (12a) but also strings like (12b). 12a. The man such that the man such that she gave this to him gave him to this left. b. The man such that the man such that she gave this to him gave this to this left. Both of these, being double center-embedded, are prohibitively hard to process or to contextualize, of course, but we do not operate in such matters by attempting to render naive judgments of acceptability on extreme cases. Rathgiven a clear picture of what generalizations are operative in more natural cases, we apply the familiar methodology of generative grammar and extend those generalizations to the cases where unaided intuition would fail. the count of relative to does not have to be maintained, then plainly there is no proof of non-CF-ness, since a context-free grammar is able to keep track of the number of man such relative to the number of NP to NP sequences. It is only the additional burden of keeping the that allows for a proof that non-CF and thus that English is. 3. Conclusion I think there are lessons to be learned from this admittedly negative review. It is clear that linguists have succeeded in developing strong and predictive theories of what belongs to the domain of syntax and what belongs to semantics. Rather than attempting to discern the status of each new fact as it becomes crucial to some dispute, we ought to be developing general theories of language from which the correct conclusions follow in a principled way. Notice, in the present context, that both the arguments I have reviewed relate to the topic of anaphora. In both cases, I have presented evidence against the assumption that certain anaphoric elements are syntactically constrained to be identical and clausally adjacent to their antecedents (section 1) or to be present in the string (section 2). I suspect that it is generally true that anaphoric devices that can be controlled across sentence boundaries in discourse are never subject to any intrasentential constraint on identity or overt presence. As things stand, however, this is nothing more than a hunch. One conclusion we can draw from the present discussion is that we are in need of a general and widely accepted theory of syntax and semantics of anaphoric A second conclusion I would draw is that it is time to start applying to semantically interpreted linguistic systems the kind of mathematical analysis that so far is mostly conducted with regard to stringsets. We know little about what mathematical or computation power is inherent in particular systems that do not merely generate sets of strings but pair strings with representations of meanings that are appropriate to particular situations.&apos; It would be useful to have more clear results about combined syntactic and semantic systems, since no one doubts that it is the entire mapping between structure and meaning that linguists are ultimately interested in. Moreover, it has been argued fairly convincingly that some natural Sag and Hankamer (in press) and work cited there for some important progress in this direction. Pullum (1984: 117-118) for one minor and nor very surprising result, observed by Len Schubert: the set of sentences assigned denotations by a semantics associated with a CF-PSG can be non-CF. Partee and Marsh (1984), stimulated by Higginbotham&apos;s paper, discuss a problem that has potential relevance here. They note that the set of predicate calculus formulae with no vacuous quantification is not a CFL, and conjecture (but are not able to prove) that it is not even an indexed language. Linguistics, Volume 10, Numbers 3-4, July-December 1984 Geoffrey K. Pullum On Two Recent Attempts to Show that English Is Not a CFL languages cannot be described by a CF grammar in a manner that allows a suitable syntax-to-semantics mapping to be defined (see Bresnan, Kaplan, Peters, and (1982) on (in press), which I saw in a preliminary version after completing this paper but have not seen in its final form at the time of going to press, extends the result about Dutch to make a much stronger claim about a related language, Swiss German, namely that it has a syntactic analog of the Dutch pattern and overall is not even CF. Moreover, Culy (in press) also has evidence of a natural language (Bambara, spoken in West Africa) that appears to be other than CF. This changes the background to the current dispute a lot, of course. If Shieber and Culy are right, there are some aspects of the syntax of some natural languages that call for parsing by a device with greater than CF power. What I have said above about English remains true, of course, but although there may be general facts about how anaphora works that could have enabled us to predict this, we cannot predict it simply from the proposition that universal grammar does not allow supra-CF grammars. This makes me much less confident about being able to answer the rejoinder to this article that Langendoen and Postal publish in this issue. Although their facts, which I saw just as this article went to press, are not totally convincing (because the repeated-head-noun appositive relative construction they discuss is so awkward and unnatural even at the best of times), I now do not see why in principle they not be right. Perhaps I speaking and writing a non-CF language all these years, and simply hadn&apos;t realized it, like Moliere&apos;s M. Jourdain, who didn&apos;t realize he had native competence in prose.</abstract>

Higginbotham on such that clauses Higginbotham (1984) argues that English can be shown to be non-CF on the basis of the such that relative clause construction. This type of clause, he claims, is constrained to contain a pronoun anaphorically bound to the head. Thus he regards phrases as the woman such that she left as grammatical, but the man such that I saw Mary as ungrammatical. Because of this, he reasons, the intersection of the regular language L = the woman such that (the man such that)* she (gave (this + him) to (this + him))* left is here with English is the following language, to be referred to as A: {the woman such that (the man such t</context>

Gazdar (1983) provides a literature review of the topic. 3 A refinement of the context of discussion which I will ignore here is that these authors have argued that natural languages contain sentences of infinite length (e.g., infinite coordinations, see Langendoen and Postal (1984)), which means they are not recursively enumerable, and not even sets. From this perspective, the present discussion concerns those proper subparts of natural languages that contain just finite-length sentences.
