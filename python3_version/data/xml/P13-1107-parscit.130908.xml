<bodyText confidence="0.999070947368421">
In some societies, internet users have to
create information morphs (e.g. “Peace
West King” to refer to “Bo Xilai”) to avoid
active censorship or achieve other com-
munication goals. In this paper we aim
to solve a new problem of resolving en-
tity morphs to their real targets. We ex-
ploit temporal constraints to collect cross-
source comparable corpora relevant to any
given morph query and identify target can-
didates. Then we propose various novel
similarity measurements including surface
features, meta-path based semantic fea-
tures and social correlation features and
combine them in a learning-to-rank frame-
work. Experimental results on Chinese
Sina Weibo data demonstrate that our ap-
proach is promising and significantly out-
performs baseline methods1.

Language constantly evolves to maximize com-
municative success and expressive power in daily
social interactions. The proliferation of online so-
cial media significantly expedites this evolution,
as new phrases triggered by social events may be
disseminated rapidly in social media. To automati-
cally analyze such fast evolving language in social
media, new computational models are demanded.
In this paper, we focus on one particular lan-
guage evolution that creates new ways to commu-
nicate sensitive subjects because of the existence
of internet information censorship. We call this

phenomenon information morph. For example,
when Chinese online users talk about the former
politician “Bo Xilai”, they use a morph “Peace
West King” instead, a historical figure four hun-
dreds years ago who governed the same region
as Bo. Morph can be considered as a special
case of alias used for hiding true entities in ma-
licious environment (Hsiung et al., 2005; Pantel,
2006). However, social network plays an impor-
tant role in generating morphs. Usually morphs
are generated by harvesting the collective wisdom
of the crowd to achieve certain communication
goals. Aside from the purpose of avoiding cen-
sorship, other motivations for using morph include
expressing sarcasm/irony, positive/negative senti-
ment or making descriptions more vivid toward
some entities or events. Table 1 presents the wide
range of cases that are used to create the morphs.
We can see that a morph can be either a regular
term with new meaning or a newly created term.

We believe that successful resolution of morphs
is a crucial step for automated understanding of
the fast evolving social media language, which
is important for social media marketing (Bar-
wise and Meehan, 2010). Another application
is to help common users without enough back-
ground/cultural knowledge to understand internet
language for their daily use. Furthermore, our ap-
proaches can also be applied for satire or other im-
plicit meaning recognition, as well as information
extraction (Bollegala et al., 2011).

However, morph resolution in social media is
challenging due to the following reasons. First,
the sensitive real targets that exist in the same
data source under active censorship are often au-
tomatically filtered. Table 2 presents the distribu-
tions of some examples of morphs and their tar-
gets in English Twitter and Chinese Sina Weibo.
For example, the target “Chen Guangcheng” only
appears once in Weibo. Thus, the co-occurrence
of a morph and its target is quite low in the vast
amount of information in social media. Second,
most morphs were not created based on pronunci-
ations, spellings or other encryptions of their origi-
nal targets. Instead, they were created according to
semantically related entities in historical and cul-
tural narratives (e.g. “Peace West King” as morph
of “Bo Xilai”) and thus very difficult to capture
based on typical lexical features. Third, tweets
from Twitter/Chinese Weibo are short (only up to
140 characters) and noisy, resulting in difficult ex-
traction of rich and accurate evidences due to the
lack of enough contexts.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
work to use NLP and social network analysis tech-
niques to automatically resolve morphed informa-
tion. To address the above challenges, our paper
offers the following novel contributions.

<listItem confidence="0.905508571428572">
• We detect target candidates by exploiting the
dynamics of the social media to extract tem-
poral distribution of entities, based on the as-
sumption that the popularity of an individ-
ual is correlated between censored and un-
censored text within a certain time window.
• Our approach builds and analyzes heteroge-
neous information networks from multiple
sources, such as Twitter, Sina Weibo and web
documents in formal genre (e.g. news) be-
cause a morph and its target tend to appear in
similar contexts.
• We propose two new similarity measures, as
well as integrating temporal information into
the similarity measures to generate global se-
mantic features.
• We model social user behaviors and use so-
cial correlation to assist in measuring seman-
tic similarities because the users who posted
a morph and its corresponding target tend to
share similar interests and opinions.

3 Target Candidate Identification
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999305">
The general goal of the first step is to identify a list
of target candidates for each morph query from the
comparable corpora including Sina Weibo, Chi-
nese News websites and English Twitter. How-
ever, obviously we cannot consider all of the
named entities in these sources as target candi-
dates due to the sheer volume of information. In
addition, morphs are not limited to named entity
forms. In order to narrow down the scope of tar-
get candidates, we propose a Temporal Distribu-
tion Assumption as follows. The intuition is that
a morph m and its real target e should have sim-
ilar temporal distributions in terms of their occur-
rences. Suppose the data sets are separated into Z
temporal slots (e.g. by day), the assumption can
be stated as:
Let Tm = {tm1, tm2, ..., tmZm} be the set of
temporal slots each morph m occurs, and Te =
{te1, te2, ..., teZe} be the set of slots a target can-
didate e occurs. Then e is considered as a target
candidate of m if and only if, for each tmi E Tm
(i = 1, 2,..., Zm), there exist a j E {1, 2,..., Ze}
such that tmi − tej ≤ δ, where δ is a threshold
value (in this paper we set the threshold to 7 days,
which is optimized from a development set). For
comparison we also attempted topic modeling ap-
proach to detect target candidates, as shown in sec-
tion 5.3.

Fortunately, although a morph and its target may
have very different orthographic forms, they tend
to be embedded in similar semantic contexts
which involve similar topics and events. Figure 2
presents some example messages under censor-
ship (Weibo) and not under censorship (Twitter
and Chinese Daily). We can see that they include
similar topics, events (e.g., “fell from power”,
“gang crackdown”, “sing red songs”), and se-
mantic relations (e.g., family relations with “Bo
Guagua”). Therefore if we can automatically ex-
tract and exploit these indicative semantic con-
texts, we can narrow down the real targets effec-
tively.

We first extract surface features between the
morph and the candidate based on measuring or-

monly used in entity coreference resolution (e.g.
(Ng, 2010; Hsiung et al., 2005)). The measures
we use include “string edit distance”, “normalized
string edit distance” (Wagner and Fischer, 1974)
and “longest common subsequence” (Hirschberg,
1977).

4.2.2 Information Network Construction
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999926875">
We define an information network as a directed
graph G = (V, £) with an object type mapping
function τ : V → A and a link type mapping func-
tion φ : £ → R, where each object v E V belongs
to one particular object type τ(v) E A, each link
e E £ belongs to a particular relation φ(e) E R.
If two links belong to the same relation type, then
they share the same starting object type as well as
the same ending object type. An information net-
work is homogeneous if and only if there is only
one type for both objects and links, and an infor-
mation network is heterogeneous when the objects
are from multiple distinct types or there exist more
than one type of links.
In order to construct the information networks
for morphs, we apply the Standford Chinese word

segmenter with Chinese Penn Treebank segmen-
tation standard (Chang et al., 2008) and Stan-
ford part-of-speech tagger (Toutanova et al., 2003)
to process each sentence in the comparable data
sets. Then we apply a hierarchical Hidden Markov
Model (HMM) based Chinese lexical analyzer
ICTCLAS (Zhang et al., 2003) to extract named
entities, noun phrases and events.
We have also attempted using the results from
Dependency Parsing, Relation Extraction and
Event Extraction tools (Ji and Grishman, 2008)
to enrich the link types. Unfortunately the state-
of-the-art techniques for these tasks still perform
poorly on social media in terms of both accuracy
and coverage of important information, these so-
phisticated semantic links all produced negative
impact on the target ranking performance. There-
fore we limited the types of vertices into: Morph
(M), Entity(E), which includes target candidates,
Event (EV), and Non-Entity Noun Phrases (NP);
and used co-occurrence as the edge type. We ex-
tract entities, events, and non-entity noun phrases
that occur in more than one tweet as neighbors.
And for two vertices xi and xj, the weight wij
of their edge is the frequency they co-occur to-
gether within the tweets. A network schema of
such networks is shown in Figure 3. Figure 4

<bodyText confidence="0.999752875">
Given the constructed network, a straightforward
solution for finding the target for a morph is to use
link-based similarity search. However, now ob-
jects are linked to different types of neighbors, if
all neighbors are treated as the same, it may cause
information loss problems. For example, the en-
tity “重庆 (Chongqing)” is a very important aspect
characterizing the politician “薄熙来(Bo Xilai)”
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.9549745">

since he governed it, and if a morph m which is
also highly correlated with “重庆 (Chongqing)”, it
is very likely that “Bo Xilai” is the real target of m.
Therefore, the semantic features generated from
neighbors such as the entity “重庆 (Chongqing)”
should be treated differently from other types of
neighbors such as “人才(talented people)” .
In this work, we propose to measure the simi-
larity of two nodes over heterogeneous networks
as shown in Figure 3, by distinguishing neighbors
into three types according to the network schema
(i.e. entities, events, non-entity noun phrases). We
then adopt meta-path-based similarity measures
(Sun et al., 2011a; Sun et al., 2011b), which are
defined over heterogeneous networks to extract se-
mantic features. A meta-path is a path defined over
a network, and composed of a sequence of rela-
tions between different object types. For example,
as shown in Figure 3, a morph and its target can-
didate can be connected by three meta-paths, in-
cluding “M - E - E”, “M - EV - E”, and “M - NP
- E”. Intuitively, each meta-path provides a unique
angle to measure how similar two objects are.
For the determined meta-paths, we extract se-
mantic features using the similarity measures pro-
posed in (Sun et al., 2011a; Hsiung et al., 2005).
We denote the neighbor sets of certain type for a
morph m and a target candidate e as r(m) and
r(e), and a meta-path as P. We now list several
meta-path-based similarity measures below.
Common neighbors (CN). It measures the num-
ber of common neighbors that m and e share as
|r(m) n r(e)|.
Path count (PC). It measures the number of path
instances between m and e following meta-path P.

path P that can be decomposed into two shorter

pairwise random walk measures the probabil-
ity of the pairwise random walk starting from

Kullback-Leibler distance (KLD). For m and
e, the pairwise random walk probability of their
neighbors can be represented as two probability
vectors, then Kullback-Leibler distance (Hsiung
et al., 2005) can be used to compute sim(m, e).
Beyond the above similarity measures, we also
propose to use cosine-similarity-style normaliza-
tion method to modify common neighbor and pair-
wise random walk measures so that we can ensure
the morph node and the target candidate node are
strongly connected and also have similar popular-
ity. The modified algorithms penalize features in-
volved with the highly popular objects, since they
are more likely to have accidental interactions with
each other.
Normalized common neighbors (NCN). Nor-
malized common neighbors can be measured as
sim(m, e) = |Γ(m)∩Γ(e) |It refines the simple
-\/|Γ(m)|-\/|Γ(e)|
counting of common neighbors by avoiding bias
to highly visible or concentrated objects.
Pairwise random walk/cosine (PRW/cosine).
Pairwise random walk measures linkage weights
disproportionately with their visibility to their
neighbors, which may be too strong. Instead, we
propose to use a tamer normalization method as

<bodyText confidence="0.999982470588235">
A morph tends to have higher temporal correlation
with its real target, and share more similar topics
compared to other irrelevant targets. Therefore,
we propose to incorporate temporal information
into similarity measures to generate global seman-
tic features.
Let T = t1 U t2 U ... U tN be a set of temporal
slots (i.e. by day), E be the set of target candidates
for each morph m. Then for each ti E T, and each
e E E, the local semantic features simti(m, e)
is extracted based only on the information posted
within ti using one of the similarity measures in-
troduced in Section 4.2.3. Then we propose two
approaches to generate global semantic features.
The first approach is adding the similarity score
between m and e in each temporal slot to attain
the first set of global features:

4.2.5 Integrate Cross Source/Cross Genre
Information
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99960975">
Due to internet information censorship or surveil-
lance, users may need to use morphs to post sensi-
tive information. For example, the Chinese Weibo
message “都进去了,还要贡着*T吗 (Already
put in prison, still need to serve Buhou?” include
a morph *T (Buhou). In contrast, users are less
restricted in some other uncensored social media
such as Twitter. For example, the tweet from Twit-
ter “...把 薄 熙 来 称 作“平 西 王”或 者“* T”...
(...call Bo Xilai“peace west king” or “buhou”...)”
contains both the morph and the real target 薄熙
来 (Bo Xilai). Therefore, we propose to integrate
information from another source (e.g. Twitter) to
help resolution of sensitive morphs in Weibo.
Another difficulty from morph resolution in
micro-blogging is that tweets are only allowed to
contain maximum 140 characters with a lot of
noise and diverse topics. The shortness and di-
versity of tweets may limit the power of content
analysis for semantic feature extraction. However,
formal genres such as web documents are cleaner
and contain richer contexts, thus can provide more
topically related information. In this work, we also
exploit the background web documents from the

4.3 Social Features
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99937145">
It has been shown that there exist correlation be-
tween neighbors in social networks (Anagnos-
topoulos et al., 2008; Wen and Lin, 2010). Be-
cause of such social correlation, close social
neighbors in social media such as Twitter and
Weibo may post similar information, or share sim-
ilar opinion. Therefore, we can utilize social cor-
relation to assist in resolving morphs.
As social correlation can be defined as a func-
tion of social distance between a pair of users, we
use social distance as a proxy to social correla-
tion in our approach. The social distance between
user i and j is defined by considering the degree
of separation in their interaction (e.g. retweet-
ing and mentioning) and the amount of the in-
teraction. Similar definition has been shown ef-
fective in characterizing social distance in social
networks extracted from communication data (Lin
et al., 2012; Wen and Lin, 2010). Specifically,
it is dist(i, j) = �K−1

the total interactions between user i and j, includ-
ing both retweeting and mentioning (If Xij &lt; 10,

We integrate social correlation and temporal in-
formation to define our social features. The in-
tuition is that when a morph is used by an user,
the real target may also in the posts by the user or
his/her close friends within a certain time period.
Let T be the set of temporal slots a morph m oc-
curs, Ut be the set of users whose posts include m

Similar to (Hsiung et al., 2005; Sun et al., 2011a),
we then model the probability of linkage predic-
tion between a morph m and its target candidate
e as a function incorporating the surface, semantic
and social features. Given a training pair (m, e),
we choose the standard logistic regression model
to learn weights for the features defined above.
The learnt model is used to predict the probabil-

the probability, we select top k candidates as the
final answers based on the answer size k.

5.1 Data and Evaluation Metric
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999927444444444">
We collected 1, 553, 347 tweets from Chinese Sina
Weibo from May 1 to June 30 to construct the
censored data set, and retrieved 66, 559 web doc-
uments from the embedded URLs in tweets as the
initial uncensored data set. Retweets and redun-
dant web documents are filtered to ensure more
reliable frequency counting of co-occurrence rela-
tions. We asked two native Chinese annotators to
analyze the data, and construct a test set consisted
of 107 morph entities (81 persons and 26 loca-
tions) and their real targets as our references. We
verified the references by Web resources includ-
ing the summary of popular morphs in Wikipedia
2. In addition, we used 23 sensitive morphs and
the entities that appear in the tweets as queries and
retrieved 25,128 Chinese tweets from 10% Twit-
ter feeds within the same time period, as well as
7,473 web documents from the embedded URLs
and added them into the uncensored data set.
To evaluate the system performance, we use
leave-one-out cross validation by computing ac-
curacy as Acc@k = Ck Q , where Ck is the to-
tal number of correctly resolved morphs at top
k ranked answers, and Q is the total number of
morph queries. We consider a morph as correctly
resolved at the top k answers if the top k answer
set contains the real target of the morph.

5.2 Resolution Performance

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999889">
We first study the contributions of each set of sur-
face and semantic features, as shown in the first
five rows in Table 4. The poor performance based
on surface features shows that morph resolution
task is very challenging since 70% of morphs are
not orthographically similar to their real targets.
Thus, capturing a morph’s semantic meaning is
crucial. Overall, the results demonstrate the ef-
fectiveness of our proposed methods. Specifi-
cally, comparing “HomB” and “HetB”, “HomE”
and “HetE”, we can see that the semantic fea-
tures based on heterogeneous networks have ad-
vantages over those based on homogeneous net-
works. This corroborates that different neighbor
sets contribute differently, and such discrepancies
should be captured. And comparisions of “HomB”
and “HomE”, “HetB” and “HetE”demonstrate the
effectiveness of our two new proposed measures.
To evaluate the importance of each similarity mea-
sures, we delete the semantic features obtained
from each measure in “HetE” and re-evaluate the
system. We find that NCN is the most effective
measure, while KLD is the least important one.
Further adding the global semantic features signif-
icantly improves the performance. This indicates
that capturing both temporal correlations and se-
mantics of morphing simultaneously are important
for morph resolution.
Table 5 shows that combination of surface and
semantic features further improves the perfor-
mance, showing that they are complementary. For
example, using only surface features, the real tar-
get “乔布斯 (Steve Jobs)” of the morph “乔帮
主 (Qiao Boss)” is not top ranked since some other
candidates such as “乔治 (George)” are more or-
thographically similar. However, “Steve Jobs” is
ranked top when combined with semantic features.

We integrate the cross source information from
Twitter, and the cross genre information from web
documents into Weibo tweets for information net-
work construction, and extract a new set of se-
mantic features. Table 6 shows that further gains
can be achieved. Notice that integrating tweets
from Twitter mainly improves the ranking for top
k where k &gt; 1. This is because Weibo dominates
our dataset, and in Weibo many of these sensi-
tive morphs are mostly used with their traditional
meanings instead of the morph senses. Further
performance improvement is achieved by integrat-
ing information from background formal web doc-
uments which can provide richer context and rela-

The performance with and without candidate de-
tection step (using all features) is shown in Ta-
ble 8. The gain is small since the combination
of all features in the learning to rank framework
can already well capture the relationship between
a morph and a target candidate. Nevertheless, the
temporal distribution assumption is effective. It
helps to filter out 80% of unrelated targets and
speed up the system 5 times, while retain 98.5%
of the morph candidates that can be detected.

We also attempted using topic modeling ap-

amount of data, we first split the data set on a daily
basis, then applied Probabilistic Latent Semantic
Analysis (PLSA) (Hofmann, 1999). Named enti-
ties which co-occur at least δ times with a morph
query in the same topic are selected as its target
candidates. As shown in Table9 (K is the num-
ber of predefined topics), PLSA is not quite effec-
tive mainly because traditional topic modeling ap-
proaches do not perform well on short texts from
social media. Therefore, in this paper we choose
a simple method based on temporal distribution to
detect target candidates.

Compared with the standard alias detection
(“Surf+HomB”) approach (Hsiung et al., 2005),
our proposed approach achieves significantly bet-
ter performance (99.9% confidence level by the
Wilcoxon Matched-Pairs Signed-Ranks Test for
Acc@1). We further explore two types of factors
which may affect the system performance as fol-
lows.
One important aspect affecting the resolution
performance is the morph &amp; non-morph ambigu-
ity. We categorize a morph query as “Unique” if
the string is mainly used as a morph when it oc-
curs, such as “薄督 (Bodu)” which is used to re-
fer to “Bo Xilai”; otherwise as “Common” (e.g.
“宝宝 (Baby)” ,“校长 (President)” ). Table 10
presents the separate scores for these two cate-
gories. We can see that the morphs in “Unique”

separately. As shown in Table11, we can see that
the popularity is not highly correlated with the per-

To analyze social media behavior under active
censorship, (Bamman et al., 2012) automatically
discovered politically sensitive terms from Chi-
nese tweets based on message deletion analysis.
In contrast, our work goes beyond target idendi-
fication by resolving implicit morphs to their real
targets.
Our work is closely related to alias detec-
tion (Hsiung et al., 2005; Pantel, 2006; Bollegala
et al., 2011; Holzer et al., 2005). We demon-
strated that state-of-the-art alias detection meth-
ods did not perform well on morph resolution. In
this paper we exploit cross-genre information and
social correlation to measure semantic similarity.
(Yang et al., 2011; Huang et al., 2012) also showed
the effectiveness of exploiting information from
formal web documents to enhance tweet summa-
rization and tweet ranking.
Other similar research lines are the TAC-KBP
Entity Linking (EL) (Ji et al., 2010; Ji et al., 2011),
which links a named entity in news and web docu-
ments to an appropriate knowledge base (KB) en-
try, the task of mining name translation pairs from
comparable corpora (Udupa et al., 2009; Ji, 2009;
Fung and Yee, 1998; Rapp, 1999; Shao and Ng,
2004; Hassan et al., 2007) and the link predic-
tion problem (Adamic and Adar, 2001; Liben-
Nowell and Kleinberg, 2003; Sun et al., 2011b;
Hasan et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2007; Sun et al.,
2011a). Most of the work focused on unstruc-
tured or structured data with clean and rich re-
lations (e.g. DBLP). In contrast, our work con-
structs heterogeneous information networks from
unstructured, noisy multi-genre text without ex-
plicit entity attributes.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work
of resolving implicit information morphs from the
data under active censorship. Our promising re-
sults can well serve as a benchmark for this new
problem. Both of the Meta-path based and so-
cial correlation based semantic similarity mea-
surements are proven powerful and complemen-
tary.
In this paper we have focused on entity morphs.
In the future we will extend our method to dis-
cover other types of information morphs, such as
events and nominal mentions. In addition, auto-
matic identification of candidate morphs is another
challenging task, especially when the mentions are
ambiguous and can also refer to other real enti-
ties. Our ongoing work includes identifying can-
didate morphs from scratch, as well as discovering
morphs for a given target based on anomaly anal-
ysis and textual coherence modeling.

In this paper we aim to solve a new problem of resolving entity morphs to their real targets. We exploit temporal constraints to collect crosssource comparable corpora relevant to any given morph query and identify target candidates. Then we propose various novel similarity measurements including surface features, meta-path based semantic features and social correlation features and combine them in a learning-to-rank framework.

After applying the same annotation techniques as tweets for uncensored data sets, sentence-level co-occurrence relations are extracted and integrated into the network as shown in Figure 3. 4.3 Social Features It has been shown that there exist correlation between neighbors in social networks (Anagnostopoulos et al., 2008; Wen and Lin, 2010). Because of such social correlation, close social neighbors in social media such as Twitter and Weibo may post similar information, or share similar opinion. Therefore, we can utilize social correlation to assist in resolving morphs. As social correlation can be defined as a function of social distance between a pair of users, we use social distance as a proxy to social correlation in our approach. The social distance between user i and j is defined by considering the degree of separation in their interaction (e.g. retweeting and mentioning) and the amount of the interacti</context>

The measures we use include “string edit distance”, “normalized string edit distance” (Wagner and Fischer, 1974) and “longest common subsequence” (Hirschberg, 1977). 4.2.2 Information Network Construction We define an information network as a directed graph G = (V, £) with an object type mapping function τ : V → A and a link type mapping function φ : £ → R, where each object v E V belongs to one particular object type τ(v) E A, each link e E £ belongs to a particular relation φ(e) E R.

Morph can be considered as a special case of alias used for hiding true entities in malicious environment (Hsiung et al., 2005; Pantel, 2006). However, social network plays an important role in generating morphs. Usually morphs are generated by harvesting the collective wisdom of the crowd to achieve certain communication goals. Aside from the purpose of avoiding censorship, other motivations for using morph include expressing sarcasm/irony, positive/negative sentiment or making descriptions more vivid toward some entities or events.

Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms traditional alias detection methods (Hsiung et al., 2005). 2 Approach Overview Figure 1: Overview of Morph Resolution Given a morph query m, the goal of morph resolution is to find its real target. Figure 1 depicts the general procedure of our approach. It consists of two main sub-tasks: • Target Candidate Identification: For each m, discover a list of target candidates E = le1, e2, ..., eN}. First, relevant comparable data sets that include m are retrieved. In this paper we collect comparable censored data from Weibo and uncensored data from Twitter and Web documents such as news articles.

The measures we use include “string edit distance”, “normalized string edit distance” (Wagner and Fischer, 1974) and “longest common subsequence” (Hirschberg, 1977). 4.2.2 Information Network Construction We define an information network as a directed graph G = (V, £) with an object type mapping function τ : V → A and a link type mapping function φ : £ → R, where each object v E V belongs to one particular object type τ(v) E A, each link e E £ belongs to a particular relation φ(e) E R.

A meta-path is a path defined over a network, and composed of a sequence of relations between different object types. For example, as shown in Figure 3, a morph and its target candidate can be connected by three meta-paths, including “M - E - E”, “M - EV - E”, and “M - NP - E”. Intuitively, each meta-path provides a unique angle to measure how similar two objects are. For the determined meta-paths, we extract semantic features using the similarity measures proposed in (Sun et al., 2011a; Hsiung et al., 2005). We denote the neighbor sets of certain type for a morph m and a target candidate e as r(m) and r(e), and a meta-path as P. We now list several meta-path-based similarity measures below. Common neighbors (CN). It measures the number of common neighbors that m and e share as |r(m) n r(e)|. Path count (PC). It measures the number of path instances between m and e following meta-path P.

Let T be the set of temporal slots a morph m occurs, Ut be the set of users whose posts include m in slot t where t E T, and Uc be the set of close friends (i.e., social distance &lt; 0.5) for Ut. The social features are defined as s(m, e) = &amp;∈T f (e, t, Ut, Uc) |T| where f(e, t, Ut, Uc) is a indicator function which return 1 if one of the users in Ut or Uc posts tweets include the target candidate e within 7 days before t. 4.4 Learning-to-Rank Similar to (Hsiung et al., 2005; Sun et al., 2011a), we then model the probability of linkage prediction between a morph m and its target candidate e as a function incorporating the surface, semantic and social features. Given a training pair (m, e), we choose the standard logistic regression model to learn weights for the features defined above. The learnt model is used to predict the probability of linking an unseen morph and its target candidate.

We further explore two types of factors which may affect the system performance as follows. One important aspect affecting the resolution performance is the morph &amp; non-morph ambiguity. We categorize a morph query as “Unique” if the string is mainly used as a morph when it occurs, such as “薄督 (Bodu)” which is used to refer to “Bo Xilai”; otherwise as “Common” (e.g. “宝宝 (Baby)” ,“校长 (President)” ).

We have also attempted using the results from Dependency Parsing, Relation Extraction and Event Extraction tools (Ji and Grishman, 2008) to enrich the link types. Unfortunately the stateof-the-art techniques for these tasks still perform poorly on social media in terms of both accuracy and coverage of important information, these sophisticated semantic links all produced negative impact on the target ranking performance. Therefore we limited the types of vertices into: Morph (M), Entity(E), which includes target candidates, Event (EV), and Non-Entity Noun Phrases (NP); and used co-occurrence as the edge type.

Therefore, we can utilize social correlation to assist in resolving morphs. As social correlation can be defined as a function of social distance between a pair of users, we use social distance as a proxy to social correlation in our approach. The social distance between user i and j is defined by considering the degree of separation in their interaction (e.g. retweeting and mentioning) and the amount of the interaction. Similar definition has been shown effective in characterizing social distance in social networks extracted from communication data (Lin et al., 2012; Wen and Lin, 2010). Specifically, it is dist(i, j) = �K−1 k=1 strength(vk,vk+1), where 1 v1, ..., vk are the nodes on the shortest path from user i to user j, and strength(vk, vk+1) measures the strength of interactions between vk and vk+1 as: streng th( i log(Xij) , where Xij is , �) = maxj log(Xij) the total interactions between user i and j, including both retweeting and mentioning (If Xij &lt; 10, we set strength(i, j) = 0).

Morph can be considered as a special case of alias used for hiding true entities in malicious environment (Hsiung et al., 2005; Pantel, 2006). However, social network plays an important role in generating morphs. Usually morphs are generated by harvesting the collective wisdom of the crowd to achieve certain communication goals. Aside from the purpose of avoiding censorship, other motivations for using morph include expressing sarcasm/irony, positive/negative sentiment or making descriptions more vivid toward some entities or events.

Therefore, the semantic features generated from neighbors such as the entity “重庆 (Chongqing)” should be treated differently from other types of neighbors such as “人才(talented people)” . In this work, we propose to measure the similarity of two nodes over heterogeneous networks as shown in Figure 3, by distinguishing neighbors into three types according to the network schema (i.e. entities, events, non-entity noun phrases). We then adopt meta-path-based similarity measures (Sun et al., 2011a; Sun et al., 2011b), which are defined over heterogeneous networks to extract semantic features. A meta-path is a path defined over a network, and composed of a sequence of relations between different object types. For example, as shown in Figure 3, a morph and its target candidate can be connected by three meta-paths, including “M - E - E”, “M - EV - E”, and “M - NP - E”. Intuitively, each meta-path provides a unique angle to measure how similar two objects are.

An information network is homogeneous if and only if there is only one type for both objects and links, and an information network is heterogeneous when the objects are from multiple distinct types or there exist more than one type of links. In order to construct the information networks for morphs, we apply the Standford Chinese word 1085 segmenter with Chinese Penn Treebank segmentation standard (Chang et al., 2008) and Stanford part-of-speech tagger (Toutanova et al., 2003) to process each sentence in the comparable data sets.

The measures we use include “string edit distance”, “normalized string edit distance” (Wagner and Fischer, 1974) and “longest common subsequence” (Hirschberg, 1977). 4.2.2 Information Network Construction We define an information network as a directed graph G = (V, £) with an object type mapping function τ : V → A and a link type mapping function φ : £ → R, where each object v E V belongs to one particular object type τ(v) E A, each link e E £ belongs to a particular relation φ(e) E R.

Because of such social correlation, close social neighbors in social media such as Twitter and Weibo may post similar information, or share similar opinion. Therefore, we can utilize social correlation to assist in resolving morphs. As social correlation can be defined as a function of social distance between a pair of users, we use social distance as a proxy to social correlation in our approach. The social distance between user i and j is defined by considering the degree of separation in their interaction (e.g. retweeting and mentioning) and the amount of the interaction.
