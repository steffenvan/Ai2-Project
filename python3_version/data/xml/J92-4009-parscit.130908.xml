Although corpus linguistics has been around for at least three decades, i it is only in
the last several years that a corpus-based, probabilistic approach has become widely
accepted. Thus, as recently as 1987, one of the goals stated in Leech&apos;s (1987) introduc-
tion to a book on corpus-based processing was that readers would come away from
the book &amp;quot;with less inclination ... to assume that the paradigm of AT is the only one
to be successfully applied to natural language processing.&amp;quot; This situation has changed
dramatically in the last few years, with empirical, corpus-based approaches currently
being widely used for probabilistic part-of-speech taggers, syntactic parsers, and com-
putational lexicography.
However, because of the earlier predominance of Al approaches in CL, many cor-
pus linguists came to think of themselves as comprising a distinct subfield. Although
the earliest work in this area is usually associated with Brown University in the United
States (see footnote 1), most corpus-based research has been carried out in Great Britain
and Scandinavia. In 1977, a separate organization was established for corpus linguistic
research—the International Computer Archive of Modern English (ICAME)—and the
first ICAME conference was held in 1979.
The book under review here, English Computer Corpora: Selected Papers and Research
Guide (henceforth, ECC), comes from this research tradition; it contains the conference
proceedings from the Tenth ICAME meeting, held in Bergen in 1989. According to the
introduction by Johansson (p. 4), the chapters are not intended as state-of-the-art pa-
pers, but they do provide &amp;quot;good indications of the sort of work currently undertaken&amp;quot;
in this tradition.
The book is divided into eight major sections: probabilistic grammatical analysis,
syntax, lexis, speech, regional/social variation, specialized corpora, software, and a ref-
erence section. The book ranges from articles with primary computational emphases
(e.g., on techniques for probabilistic parsing, or descriptions of software tools for cor-
pus analyses) to papers with primary linguistic emphases (e.g., functional analyses of
infinitival complement clauses and modals).
Two of the chapters in the first section, dealing with probabilistic tagging and
parsing techniques, are written by some of the first researchers to demonstrate the
1 In the early 1960s, Francis and KilCera began work on the Brown Corpus, a computer-based collection
of 500 published texts of American English from 15 major text categories, comprising one million
words of text; the first user manual for the corpus was published in 1964 (Francis and KuCera 1964).

importance of a probabilistic approach for natural language processing: DeRose, and
Leech and Garside (cf. DeRose 1988; Garside, Leech, and Sampson 1987; Church 1988).
The paper by DeRose briefly describes several tests of his linear-time algorithm for
word tagging (Volsunga), on English and Greek texts; for example, he compares the
results based exclusively on relative word-tag probabilities with those based on collo-
cational probabilities (achieving over 90% accuracy in both cases). Leech and Garside
describe the history of their project to develop a large &apos;treebank&apos; of parsed English
texts, with the eventual goal of using the treebank to derive a probabilistic phrase
structure grammar; four stages of research are described, using both hand parsing
and automatic parsing. (The chapter by Souter and O&apos;Donoghue describes research in
progress on a &amp;quot;Realistic Annealing Parser.&amp;quot;)
There are three chapters that focus on syntactic description, illustrating quite differ-
ent analytical approaches. De Haan uses quantitative statistical techniques to analyze
the functions of nominal postmodifying clauses, while Mair argues (from an analysis
of infinitival complement clauses) that qualitative corpus-based analyses are equally
important because the corpus provides &amp;quot;authentic and realistic data.&amp;quot; Ihalainen com-
pares variation in the form of grammatical subjects in spoken corpora of educated and
dialectal English.
Lexical matters are dealt with by Brekke, Vossen, Altenberg, and Collins. Brekke
analyzes the various senses of the word wall in the Brown and Lancaster—Oslo/Bergen
(LOB) corpora, and Vossen analyzes the treatment of polysemy in the Longman Diction-
ary of Contemporary English. The paper by Altenberg describes amplifier collocations
in spoken English (based on the London—Lund Corpus), emphasizing the repetitive
nature of speech and the high frequencies of some recurrent amplifier combinations.
Collins compares the functions of will and shall in Australian, British, and American
English. (The papers by Knowles and Wichman deal with the marking of prosody
in transcriptions of speech; software tools are described in the chapters by Brodda,
Hofland, and Nol.)
The large number of corpora analyzed in the papers in ECC reflects the rapid
expansion in the availability of on-line text collections. The chapter by Faber and
Lauridsen describes the careful design principles used to build a parallel Danish—
English—French corpus in contract law; Leitner describes the Kolhapur Corpus of In-
dian English; and Ljung analyzes the distribution of vocabulary in a corpus of English
secondary school textbooks used hi Sweden (the GYM corpus). Other corpora used for
the analyses in this book include: the Brown Corpus, the LOB Corpus, the COBUILD
Corpus, the Lancaster /IBM Spoken English Corpus, the Nijmegen Corpus, the Aus-
tralian Corpus, and the Helsinki Corpus of Modern English Dialects. The chapter by
Taylor, Leech, and Fligelstone provides a useful survey of English machine-readable
corpora available in 1989. Finally, a survey article by Altenberg presents a bibliogra-
phy of publications based on English computer corpora, including approximately 650
entries.
As the title states, the papers in ECC deal exclusively with English corpora. In
addition, apart from the chapter by Ljung (which includes analysis of the 18 million
words of text in the COBUILD Main and Reserve Corpora), the papers in this vol-
ume do not include analyses of very large corpora.&apos; Overall, though, ECC offers a
good overview of the kinds of linguistic and computational research based on English
computer corpora.

2 The meaning of large in the collocation large corpus has shifted dramatically over the last several years;
in 1989 there were few projects based on corpora larger than 1 million words, while at present several
projects are analyzing corpora of 100 million words (or larger).
