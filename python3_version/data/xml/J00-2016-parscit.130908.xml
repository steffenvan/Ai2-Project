This volume is a collection of important pa-
pers selected from the proceedings of the
first three Workshops on Very Large Corpora
(Columbus, 1993; Kyoto, 1994; Cambridge,
MA, 1995) and the 1995 workshop entitled
From Text to Tags (Dublin). The editors write
in their introduction: &amp;quot;The success of these
workshops was in some measure a reflection
of the growing popularity of corpus-based
methods in the NLP community But first and
foremost, it was due to the fact that the work-
shops attracted so many high-quality papers.
The importance of this material for the field
is such that it deserves to be made more read-
ily available than harder-to-find or out-of-
print workshop proceedings.&amp;quot; The contents
of the volume are as follows:

&amp;quot;This book is the development of a series of
lectures to undergraduate and post-graduate
students at Macquarie University on basic
principles in acoustic phonetics and speech
signal processing. The first part of the book is
intended to provide students with the ability
to interpret acoustic records of speech sig-
nals in their various forms. These chapters
include a review of elementary wave mo-
tion and frequency analysis as applied to
speech, a summary of the relationship be-
tween speech production and its acoustic
consequences, and a review of the principal
cues to speech sounds and prosodic units.

Briefly Noted
The material from these first four chapters
(and the related exercises on the accompa-
nying CD-ROM) has formed the basis of a
one-semester undergraduate course in acous-
tic phonetics to students primarily of linguis-
tics, but also of other disciplines including
computer science and psychology.
&amp;quot;The second part of the book provides
an introduction to speech signal processing,
which is intended for similar groups of stu-
dents. It is therefore different from more de-
tailed introductory texts in this area, which
assume both a background in engineering /
signal processing and a more sophisticated
mathematical knowledge. Part of the moti-
vation for writing this section of the book is
to make many of the techniques and algo-
rithms that are discussed in the engineering
literature on speech analysis more accessible
to both students and researchers of phonetics
and speech science whose training is not usu-
ally in a scientific discipline. We have there-
fore tried to keep equations to a minimum
and to assume, as far as possible, no more
than a very basic understanding of algebra
and trigonometry. In this part of the book we
cover fundamental aspects of time and fre-
quency domain processing of speech signals,
digital techniques for combining (in digital
formant synthesis) and separating (in linear
predictive coding) the contributions of the
source and filter to the acoustic speech sig-
nal, and techniques for the probabilistic clas-
sification of acoustic speech data that form
the basis of more advanced work in auto-
matic speech recognition.&amp;quot;—From the preface

&amp;quot;Syntactic Theory: A Formal Introduction . . .
marks a return to &apos;generative grammar&apos; in
its original sense. This book focuses on the
development of precisely formulated gram-
mars whose empirical predictions can be di-
rectly tested. There is considerable emphasis
on prediction and evaluation of grammatical
hypotheses, as well as on integrating syntac-
tic hypotheses with matters of semantic anal-
ysis. Problem solving is also emphasized; the
extensive problem sets draw from a variety
of languages other than English. Special at-
tention is paid to the nature of lexical en-
tries and the organization of the lexicon in
terms of type hierarchies and constraint in-
heritance. The theoretical perspective of the
book is presented in the context of current
models of language processing, which pro-
vide motivation for a constraint-based, lexi-
calist grammatical architecture, whose value
has already been demonstrated in computer
language processing applications.&amp;quot;—From the

Word-Order Based Grammar

&amp;quot;In this book, I propose, in outline, a new
theory of grammar, which I call Word-Order
Based Grammar.
&amp;quot;In my theory, word order is the primary
grammatical principle. It is accompanied by
the principle of lexical valency, and the prin-
ciple of the recursive expansion of the sen-
tence.
&amp;quot;I offer alternative accounts of the ma-
jor problems of linguistic theory in terms
of word-order: for the scoping properties of
the operators of natural language ... ; for
anaphoric reference ... ; for wh-extraction,
movement and parasitic gaps ... ; and for
word-order in general ...
&amp;quot;I propose that there are five basic types of
word-order: fixed deep word-order, free deep
word-order, fixed surface word-order, free
surface word-order corresponding to deep
word-order, and free surface word-order not
corresponding to deep word-order.&amp;quot;—From
