Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.963356944444444">
We are pleased to present the proceedings of the Workshop on Computationally Hard Problems and
Joint Inference in Speech and Language Processing, held at HLT/NAACL 2006 in New York City, New
York.
Recent work on ranking, sampling and other approximate solutions to natural language processing
problems indicate that researchers are coming back to the hard problems in speech and text, for which
efficient algorithms are not known to exist. In addition, there has been increasing interest in moving
away from systems that make chains of local decisions independently, and instead toward systems that
make multiple decisions jointly using global information. The goal of this workshop is to bring together
researchers working on NLP problems whose solutions are computationally hard—whether because the
problem is not well modeled by only local features, or because the problem is best solved in a joint,
rather than pipelined, manner.
We are grateful to the program committee for providing thoughtful and helpful reviews of the submitted
papers. We also thank our invited speakers, Jeff Bilmes, Chris Manning, Dan Roth, and Giorgio
Satta. Finally, we thank the organizers of the main HLT/NAACL 2006 conference, without which
this workshop would not be possible.
