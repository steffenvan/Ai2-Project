Finding Out About
A Cognitive Perspective on Search
Engine Technology and the WWW
Richard K. Belew
</note>
<bodyText confidence="0.98777148">
The World Wide Web is rapidly Filling
with more text than anyone could have
imagined a short time ago. However, the
task of determining which data is relevant
has become appreciably harder. In this
original new work Richard Belew brings
a cognitive science perspective to the study
of information as a computer science dis-
cipline. He introduces the idea of Finding
Out About (FOA), the process of actively
seeking out information relevant to a topic
of interest. Belew describes all facets of FOA,
ranging from creating a good characteriza-
tion of what the user seeks to evaluating the
successful performance of search engines.
His volume clearly shows how to build
many of the tools that are useful for search-
ing collections of text and other media.
While computer scientists make up the
book&apos;s primary audience, Belew skillfully
presents technical details in a manner
that makes important themes accessible
to readers more comfortable with words
than equations.

A Computational Theory of
Writing Systems
Richard Sproat
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.960501176470588">
This innovative book develops a formal
computational theory of writing systems
and relates it to psycholinguistic results.
Drawing on case studies of writing systems
around the world, it offers specific pro-
posals about the linguistic objects that
are represented by orthographic elements
and the formal constraints that hold the
mapping relation between them. Based on
the insights gained, it posits a new taxon-
omy of writing systems. The book will
be of interest to students and researchers
in theoretical and computational linguistics,
the psycholinguistics of reading and writing,
and speech technology.

Researchers in theoretical linguistics,
psycholinguistics, cognitive science, and
natural language processing have recently
converged on a collective insight: formal-
izing the syntax of words is central to
describing, understanding, and analyzing
language. This insight has sparked consid-
erable interest in Tree Adjoining Grammar,
a lexically-oriented mathematical formalism
that can precisely capture the syntactic
properties of natural languages such as
English or Korean. This volume combines
contributions from a variety of authors
who discuss the formalism itself, its use
in analyzing linguistic phenomena, and its
use in building natural language processing
systems.

Implementing Typed Feature
Structure Grammars
Ann Copestake
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9928005">
Much of the work in modern formal
linguistics is concerned with giving
mathematically precise accounts of human
languages. Such work is particularly suited
for research that involves language process-
ing with computers. This book provides an
introduction to one particularly popular
approach, typed-feature structure formal-
isms. Implementing Typed Feature Structure
Grammars includes informal (but rigorous)
descriptions of typed-feature structure logic
as well as formal definitions. The book
covers the basics of grammar development
by introducing different frameworks to
the reader. Semantic representation is
also introduced. The book includes a CD-
ROM of the LKB system software. The
CD-ROM is compatible with Windows,
MacOS, Linux and Solaris, and includes
a full user manual.

The book offers contributions to a number

of key foundational issues and of what
Property Theory can contribute to them.
The book starts with a version of Property
Theory that stems from a combination
of the lambda calculus with Aczel&apos;s Frege
structures. Fox improves on it and substan-
tially extends it with original applications
to plurals and mass nouns, to &amp;quot;intensional
individuals&amp;quot; and to the dynamics of dis-
course. This volume should be of interest
to researchers engaged in the cognitive

Optimality Theoretic Syntax
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.945416384615385">
Peter Sells, Editor
This is a collection of papers that involves
a new approach to syntax bringing together
Optimality Theory (OT) and Lexical-
Functional Grammar (LFG). Its impor-
tance is precisely in this new approach,
which differs from other OT approaches
to syntax. The papers involve analysis of
certain kinds of linguistic data, as well as
more technical questions of the formal
foundations, and of the utility of the
approach in (industrial) natural language
processing applications.

Structure, Alignment and
Optimality in Swedish
Peter Sells
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999884052631579">
This volume explores the grammatical
structure of sentences in Swedish, present-
ing an account of the order of the words
and phrases within the clause. This analysis
is presented from the perspective of
Optimality Theory within the theoretical
framework of Lexical-Functional Grammar.
This framework provides syntactic analysis
in terms of functions within the clause
such as subject, object, and also topic and
focus, as well as part-of-speech analysis in
terms of noun phrase, verb phrase, and so
on, and the hierarchical structure of those
constituents. Sells argues for the superiority
of a base-generated account of the phenom-
enon known as Object Shift, and shows
how an account based on the notion of
Alignment within a ranked constraint
system provides a natural account of it.

Guidelines for Submissions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98930628125">
Submissions may be made in any of the following categories: Papers (Short or Long), Letters to
the Editor, Squibs and Discussions):
Papers report significant new research results in computational linguistics. Each paper is re-
viewed by at least two experts in the field. The submission of an article to CL for refereeing
means that it has not been copyrighted, has not been published in or submitted for publication
to another refereed archival publication, and has not appeared in any conference or workshop
proceedings. The submitted manuscript must be available for peer review without restriction.
If any version of the paper has appeared, or will appear, in any other publication, the details of
such publication must be made known to the Editor at the time of submission. The final version
of a paper tentatively accepted for publication must be accompanied by a Copyright Transfer
Agreement signed by all of the authors or, in the case of a &amp;quot;work for hire,&amp;quot; by the employer.
This written transfer is necessary under the 1978 U.S. Copyright law.
Manuscripts for Computational Linguistics should be submitted on letter-size paper (8.5 by
11 inches, or A4), double-spaced throughout, including footnotes and references. The paper
should begin with an informative abstract of approximately 150-250 words. Manuscripts must
be written in English. Guidelines for electronic submission and style files are available from
http://www.aclweb.org/cl/. Submissions should be specified by the submitter as a submission
to one of two categories, Short Papers or Long Papers, and must include word counts. Papers
in these two categories will be reviewed by slightly different procedures:
Short Papers, of no more than 15 journal pages (about 4000 words), will receive expedited review
by two reviewers. Such a paper might, for example, contain a description of a single experiment,
algorithm, or other technical result. Authors whose papers are accepted are expected to submit
final versions within 8 weeks of notification.
Long Papers, exceeding 15 journal pages, will receive standard review. Such a longer paper
might, for example, describe the results of a large research project or dissertation. These sub-
missions should normally not exceed 30 journal pages (about 8000 words).
All submissions, regardless of length, will be held to the same standards of technical and pre-
sentation quality.
Letters to the Editor: This category includes statements of opinion on issues relevant to the
readership. The Editor and the editorial board will evaluate the appropriateness of these con-
tributions for inclusion.
For hard copy submissions, five copies of papers or three copies of letters should be sent to:

Founded in 1962, the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) is the primary scientific and
professional society for natural language processing research and applications. A European chapter was
established in 1982 and a North American chapter was established in 1999. Besides publishing
Computational Linguistics, the ACL holds international meetings annually as well as sponsoring
frequently-held European and North American chapter meetings where the state-of-the-art in natural
language processing research and development is presented. Special interest groups on the Mathematics
of Language, the Lexicon, Parsing, Generation, Computational Phonology, Multimedia Language
Processing, Very Large Corpora, Natural Language Learning, and Dialogue Processing have been formed;
others are likely to be added.

<author confidence="0.999882">Richard K Belew</author>
<abstract confidence="0.991929791666667">The World Wide Web is rapidly Filling with more text than anyone could have imagined a short time ago. However, the task of determining which data is relevant has become appreciably harder. In this original new work Richard Belew brings a cognitive science perspective to the study of information as a computer science discipline. He introduces the idea of Finding Out About (FOA), the process of actively seeking out information relevant to a topic of interest. Belew describes all facets of FOA, ranging from creating a good characterization of what the user seeks to evaluating the successful performance of search engines. His volume clearly shows how to build many of the tools that are useful for searching collections of text and other media. While computer scientists make up the book&apos;s primary audience, Belew skillfully presents technical details in a manner that makes important themes accessible to readers more comfortable with words than equations.</abstract>

<author confidence="0.99684">Richard Sproat</author>
<abstract confidence="0.989751466666667">This innovative book develops a formal computational theory of writing systems and relates it to psycholinguistic results. Drawing on case studies of writing systems around the world, it offers specific proposals about the linguistic objects that are represented by orthographic elements and the formal constraints that hold the mapping relation between them. Based on the insights gained, it posits a new taxonomy of writing systems. The book will be of interest to students and researchers in theoretical and computational linguistics, the psycholinguistics of reading and writing, and speech technology.</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.983030473684211">Abeille Rambow, Researchers in theoretical linguistics, psycholinguistics, cognitive science, and natural language processing have recently converged on a collective insight: formalizing the syntax of words is central to describing, understanding, and analyzing language. This insight has sparked considerable interest in Tree Adjoining Grammar, a lexically-oriented mathematical formalism that can precisely capture the syntactic properties of natural languages such as English or Korean. This volume combines contributions from a variety of authors who discuss the formalism itself, its use in analyzing linguistic phenomena, and its use in building natural language processing systems.</abstract>
