We present a program for segmenting texts ac-
cording to the separate events they describe.
A modular architecture is described that al-
lows us to examine the contributions made by
particular aspects of natural language to event
structuring. This is applied in the context of
terrorist news articles, and a technique is sug-
gested for evaluating the resulting segmenta-
tions. We also examine the usefulness of vari-
ous heuristics in forming these segmentations.

Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999792464285714">
One of the issues to emerge from recent evaluations of
information extraction systems (Sundheim, 1992) is the
importance of discourse processing (Iwanska et al., 1991)
and, in particular, the ability to recognise multiple events
in a text. It is this task that we address here.
We are developing a program that assigns message-
level event structures to newswire texts. Although the
need to recognise events has been widely acknowledged,
most approaches to information extraction (IE) perform
this task either as a part of template merging late in
the IE process (Grishman and Sterling, 1993) or, in a
few cases, as an integral part of some deeper reasoning
mechanism (e.g. (Hobbs et al., 1991)).
Our approach is based on the assumption that dis-
course processing should be done early in the informa-
tion extraction process. This is by no means a new idea.
The arguments in favour of an early discourse segmen-
tation are well known — easier coreference of entities, a
reduced volume of text to be subjected to necessarily
deeper analysis, and so on.
Because of this early position in the IE process, an
event recognition program is faced with a necessarily
shallow textual representation. The purpose of our work
is, therefore, to investigate the quality of text segmenta-
tion that is possible given such a surface form.

Event recognition
What is an event?
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99999025">
If we are to distinguish between events, it is important
that we know what they look like. This is harder than
it might at first seem. A closely related (though not
identical) problem is found in recognising boundaries in
discourse, and there seems to be little agreement in the
literature as to the properties and functions they pos-
sess (Morris and Hirst, 1991), (Grosz and Sidner, 1986).
Our system is aimed at documents typified by those
in the MUC-4 corpus (Sundheim, 1992). These deal
with Latin American terrorist incidents, and vary widely
in terms of origin, medium and purpose. In the task
description for the MUC-4 evaluation, two events are
deemed to be distinct if they describe either multiple
types of incident or multiple instances of a particular
type of incident, where instances are distinguished by
having different locations, dates, categories or perpetra-
tors. (NRaD, 1992)
Although this definition suffers from a certain amount
of circularity, it nonetheless points to an interesting fea-
ture of events at least in so far as physical incidents are
concerned. It is generally the case that such incidents do
possess only one location, date, category or description.
Perhaps we can make use of this information in assigning
an event-segmentation to a text?

Current approaches
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999895214285714">
As an 1E system processes a document, it typically cre-
ates a template for each sentence (Hobbs, 1993), a frame-
like data structure that contains a maximally explicit
and regularised representation of the information the
system is designed to extract. Templates are merged
with earlier ones unless they contain incompatible slot-
fills.
Although more exotic forms of event recognition exist
at varying levels of analysis (such as within the abductive
reasoning mechanism of SRI&apos;s TACITUS system (Hobbs
et al., 1991), in a thesaurus-based lexical cohesion algo-
rithm (Morris and Hirst, 1991) and in a semantic net-
work (Kozima, 1993)), template merging is the most
used method.

Modular constraint-based event
recognition
The system described here consists of (currently) three
analysis modules and an event manager (see figure 1).
Two of the analysis modules perform a certain amount
of island-driven parsing (one extracts time-related infor-
mation, and the other location-related information), and
the third is simply a pattern matcher. They are designed
to run in parallel on the same text.

Event manager
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999492153846154">
The role of the event manager is to propose an event
segmentation of the text. To do this, it makes use of the
constraints it receives from the analysis modules com-
bined with a number of document-structuring heuristics.
Many clauses (&amp;quot;quiet clauses&amp;quot;) are free from constraint
relationships, and it is in these cases that the heuristics
are used to determine how clauses should be clustered.
A text segmentation can be represented as a grid with
clauses down one side, and events along the other. Fig-
ure 2 contains a representation of a sample news text,
and shows how this maps onto a clause/event grid. The
phrases overtly referring to time and location have been
underlined.

Analysis modules
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999941862068965">
The fragments of natural language that represent time
and location are by no means trivial to recognise, let
alone interpret. Consequently, and in keeping with the
fast and shallow approach we have adopted, the range of
spatio-temporal concepts the program handles has been
restricted.
For example, the semantic components of both mod-
ules know about points in time/space only, and not
about durations. There are practical and theoretical
reasons for this policy decision — the aim of the system
is only to distinguish between events, and though the
ability to represent durations is in a very few situations
useful for this task, the engineering overheads in incor-
porating a more complex reasoning mechanism make it
difficult to do so within such a shallow paradigm.
The first two analysis modules independently assign
explicit, regularised PATR-like representations to the
time- and location-phrases they find. Graph unification
is then used to build a set of constraints determining
which clauses&apos; in a text can refer to the same event. Each
module then passes its constraints to the event manager.
The third module identifies sentences containing a
subset of cue phrases. The presence of a cue phrase in
a sentence is used to signal the start of a (totally) new
event.
&apos;A clause in this case is delimited in much the same
way as in Hobbs et al&apos;s terminal substring parser (Hobbs
et al., 1991), i.e. by commas, relative pronouns, some
conjunctions and some forms of that.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.790304">
Structuring strategies
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999819">
Although the legal event assignments for a particular
clause may be restricted by constraints, there may still
be multiple events to which that clause can be assigned.
Three structuring strategies are being investigated.
The first dictates that clauses should be assigned to the
lowest non-conflicting event value; the second favours
non-conflicting event values of the most recently assigned
clauses. The third strategy involves a mix of the above,
favouring the event value of the previous clause, followed
by the lowest non-conflicting event values.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.744936">
Heuristics
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999938894736842">
Various heuristics are used to gel together quiet
clauses in the document. The first heuristic operates
at the paragraph level. If a sentence-initial clause ap-
pears in a sentence that is not paragraph-initial, then
it is assigned to the same event as the first clause in
the previous sentence. We are therefore making some
assumptions about the way reporters structure their ar-
ticles, and part of our work will be to see whether such
assumptions are valid ones.
The second heuristic operates in much the same way
as the first, but at the level of sentences. It is based on
the reasoning that quiet clauses should be assigned to the
same event as previous clauses within the sentence. As
such, it only operates on clauses that are not sentence-
initial.
Finally, a third heuristic is used which identifies sim-
ilarities between sentences based on n-gram frequen-
cies (Salton and Buckley, 1992). Areas to investigate
are the optimum value for n, the effect of normalization

on term vector calculation, and the potential advantages
of using a threshold.
This heuristic also interacts with the text structuring
strategies described above; when it is activated, it can
be used to override the default strategy.

Experiments and evaluation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.980792">
Whilst the issue of evaluation of information extraction
in general has been well addressed, the evaluation of
event recognition in particular has not. We have devised
a method of evaluating segmentation grids that seems to
closely match our intuitions about the &amp;quot;goodness&amp;quot; of a
grid when compared to a model.
The system is being tested on a corpus of 400 messages
(average length 350 words). Each message is processed
by the system in each of 192 different configurations (i.e.
with/without paragraph heuristic, varying the cluster-
ing strategy etc.), and the resulting grids are converted
into binary strings. Essentially, each clause is compared
asymmetrically with each other, with a &amp;quot;1&amp;quot; denoting a
difference in events, and a &amp;quot;0&amp;quot; denoting same events.
Figure 2 shows an example of a binary string corre-
sponding to the grid in the same figure. Figure 3 shows a
particular 4-clause grid scored against all other possible
4-clause grids, where the grid at the top is the intended
correct one, and the scores reflect degrees of similarity
between relevant binary strings.

In order to evaluate these computer generated grids,
a set of manually derived grids is needed. For the final
evaluation, these will be supplied by naive subjects so as
to minimise the possibility of any knowledge of the pro-
gram&apos;s techniques influencing the manual segmentation.

Conclusions and future work
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999985071428571">
We have manually segmented 100 texts and have com-
pared them against computer-generated grids. Scoring
has yielded some interesting results, as well as suggesting
further areas to investigate.
The results show that fragments of time-oriented lan-
guage play an important role in signalling shifts in
event structure. Less important is location information
— in fact, the use of such information actually results
in a slight overall degradation of system performance.
Whether this is because of problems in some aspect of
the location analysis module, or simply a result of the
way we use location descriptions, is an area currently
under investigation.
The paragraph and clause heuristics also seem to be
useful, with the omission of the clause heuristic causing a
considerable degradation in performance. The contribu-
tions of n-gram frequencies and the cue phrase analysis
module are yet to be fully evaluated, although early re-
sults are encouraging.
It therefore seems that, despite both the shallow level
of analysis required to have been performed (the program
doesn&apos;t know what the events actually are) and our sim-
plification of the nature of events (we don&apos;t know what
they really are either), a modular constraint-based event
recognition system is a useful tool for exploring the use
of particular aspects of language in structuring multiple
events, and for studying the applicability of these aspects
for automatic event recognition.

We are therefore making some assumptions about the way reporters structure their articles, and part of our work will be to see whether such assumptions are valid ones. The second heuristic operates in much the same way as the first, but at the level of sentences. It is based on the reasoning that quiet clauses should be assigned to the same event as previous clauses within the sentence. As such, it only operates on clauses that are not sentenceinitial. Finally, a third heuristic is used which identifies similarities between sentences based on n-gram frequencies (Salton and Buckley, 1992). Areas to investigate are the optimum value for n, the effect of normalization 297 on term vector calculation, and the potential advantages of using a threshold. This heuristic also interacts with the text structuring strategies described above; when it is activated, it can be used to override the default strategy. Experiments and evaluation Whilst the issue of evaluation of information extraction in general has been well addressed, the evaluation of event recognition in particular has not.

<context position="754" citStr="Sundheim, 1992" startWordPosition="107" endWordPosition="108">burgh, Eli 1HN UK j.crowe@ed.ac.uk Abstract We present a program for segmenting texts according to the separate events they describe. A modular architecture is described that allows us to examine the contributions made by particular aspects of natural language to event structuring. This is applied in the context of terrorist news articles, and a technique is suggested for evaluating the resulting segmentations. We also examine the usefulness of various heuristics in forming these segmentations. Introduction One of the issues to emerge from recent evaluations of information extraction systems (Sundheim, 1992) is the importance of discourse processing (Iwanska et al., 1991) and, in particular, the ability to recognise multiple events in a text. It is this task that we address here. We are developing a program that assigns messagelevel event structures to newswire texts. Although the need to recognise events has been widely acknowledged, most approaches to information extraction (IE) perform this task either as a part of template merging late in the IE process (Grishman and Sterling, 1993) or, in a few cases, as an integral part of some deeper reasoning mechanism (e.g. (Hobbs et al., 1991)).
