Not that long ago, all linguistics was corpus linguistics. For much of the twentieth
century, though, changes in theoretical fashion put linguists for whom collections of
texts are the primary object of study at the margins of the field. Now things are shifting
again, and a new generation of linguists with a wakening interest in linguistic data
is returning to the field’s corpus-based roots. What they are finding is that technolog-
ical and methodological advances have quietly revolutionized corpus linguistics. In
Corpus Linguistics: Readings in a Widening Discipline, editors Geoffrey Sampson and
Diana McCarthy have put together a volume aimed at filling in some of what has
happened in corpus linguistics while no one was watching.
This collection of 43 reprinted papers, with original publication dates ranging from
1965 to 2002, includes a few of the usual suspects and a number of more-often-cited-
than-read classics, making it an ideal source for an upper division course on corpus
linguistics, or to supply what new corpus linguists (or their teachers) wish they had
learned in grad school. Beyond these core contributions, however, the editors have
wisely included an idiosyncratic selection of more-obscure papers guaranteed to stir the
imagination of anyone with a professional interest in language. Papers on, for example,
second language teaching, the discourse properties of Internet Relay Chat, and “non-
indigenous minority languages” (such as South Asian languages spoken in the UK)
show some of the possibilities that corpus-based methods have to offer beyond their
philological foundations.
While presented in chronological order, the papers in this volume for the most part
fall into three classes. The largest is made up of papers on corpus design and method-
ology, such as Nelson Francis on the construction of the Brown corpus, Burnage and
Dunlop on the British National Corpus, and B¨ohmov´a and Hajiˇcov´a on the Prague De-
pendency Treebank. The second group are papers on the descriptive analysis of corpora.
One, an excerpt from Charles Fries’s The Structure of English, predates computational
corpus analysis, but most of the rest are quantitative studies of English grammatical
features. This group includes papers on cleft and pseudo-cleft constructions (Collins),
that vs. null complementizers (Rissanen), and the use of terms of abuse (McEnery
et al.). The third class of papers addresses technical issues in computational linguistics.
Some of the classics in this group include Gale and Church on smoothing corpus counts,
Hindle and Rooth on prepositional phrase attachment, and Briscoe and Carroll on
parser evaluation. In this group we also find a number of less-well-known papers,
such as contributions on coding dialog moves and on predicting intonation in spoken
language corpora. Finally, there are a handful of papers that offer some personal and
historical perspective on the field, most notably Sampson’s “Reflections of a dendro-
grapher,” the text of a lecture originally delivered at a 2001 conference in honor of
pioneering corpus linguist Geoffrey Leech.
Computational Linguistics Volume 32, Number 1
Beyond the selection of papers, the “value added” material in this collection is uni-
formly helpful and well done. Sampson and McCarthy have provided each contribution
with an introduction that sets the scene for the paper, putting it into its historical context
and providing references for any necessary background (both within the collection
and to external sources), and pointing out what hindsight has revealed as some of its
strengths and weaknesses. In addition, the editors have normalized the notation and
references in each paper and compiled a comprehensive index, bibliography, and list
of abbreviations. In an interesting modern addition, citations of online sources in each
chapter have been replaced with references to a single list of URLs. While this notation
is explained in the introduction, on my first pass through the book I didn’t realize that
“[jcc]” was a reference to Jean Carletta’s homepage at Edinburgh. And, inevitably, a
reorganization of the School of Informatics’s Web space means that the URL given in
the book is no longer valid. Perhaps a volunteer could be persuaded to set up a website
with up-to-date URLs and other online resources for the papers collected here.
If I had to name a complaint about this volume, it would be the shortage of papers
that directly address current issues in theoretical linguistics. Indeed, this collection does
not seem to have been assembled with theoretical linguists in mind; readers are directed
to Jurafsky and Martin (2000) for a discussion of phrase-structure grammar. It’s hard to
fault the editors for this, given the principled stance many theoretical linguistics have
taken against corpus-based methodology. However, this is rapidly changing (witness
any recent issue of Language), and I suspect there will be many generativists among the
newcomers to corpus linguistics in the coming years. They will find less an offer for
them here than others coming from neighboring disciplines.
With that small caveat, I highly recommend Corpus Linguistics: Readings in a Widen-
ing Discipline to anyone with any interest in linguistic corpora. Besides bringing stu-
dents and practitioners of other branches of linguistics up to speed on advances in
modern corpus linguistics, this volume may as a secondary effect help inform applied,
computational, descriptive, and even theoretical linguists about each other’s fields. In
what other volume is one likely to find papers on both second language curriculum
design and methods for constructing treebank grammars? In any event, this collection
is a wonderful addition to the currently available textbooks on corpus linguistics, and
provides yet another reason that, as the editors say in their introduction, “this is a good
time to become a corpus linguist” (page 3).
