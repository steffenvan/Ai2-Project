<bodyText confidence="0.997957">
It has been widely recognized that one of the
most difficult and intriguing problems in
natural language processing (NLP) is how to
cope with idiosyncratic multiword expressions.
This paper presents an overview of the
comprehensive dictionary (JDMWE) of
Japanese multiword expressions. The JDMWE
is characterized by a large notational, syntactic,
and semantic diversity of contained expressions
as well as a detailed description of their
syntactic functions, structures, and flexibilities.
The dictionary contains about 104,000
expressions, potentially 750,000 expressions.
This paper shows that the JDMWE’s validity
can be supported by comparing the dictionary
with a large-scale Japanese N-gram frequency
dataset, namely the LDC2009T08, generated by
Google Inc. (Kudo et al. 2009).

<bodyText confidence="0.999946464285714">
Linguistically idiosyncratic multiword expressions
occur in authentic sentences with an unexpectedly
high frequency. Since (Sag et al. 2002), we have
become aware that a proper solution of
idiosyncratic multiword expressions (MWEs) is
one of the most difficult and intriguing problems in
NLP. In principle, the nature of the idiosyncrasy of
MWEs is twofold: one is idiomaticity, i.e., non-
compositionality of meaning; the other is the
strong probabilistic affinity between component
words. Many attempts have been made to extract
these expressions from corpora, mainly using
automated methods that exploit statistical means.
However, to our knowledge, no reliable, extensive
solution has yet been made available, presumably
because of the difficulty of extracting correctly
without any human insight. Recognizing the
crucial importance of such expressions, one of the
authors of the current paper began in the 1970s to
construct a Japanese electronic dictionary with
comprehensive inclusion of idioms, idiom-like
expressions, and probabilistically idiosyncratic
expressions for general use. In this paper, we begin
with an overview of the JDMWE (Japanese
Dictionary of Multi-Word Expressions). It has
approximately 104,000 dictionary entries and
covers potentially at least 750,000 expressions.
The most important features of the JDMWE are:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9834355">
1. A large notational, syntactic, and semantic
diversity of contained expressions
2. A detailed description of syntactic function and
structure for each entry expression
3. An indication of the syntactic flexibility of entry
expressions (i.e., possibility of internal
modification of constituent words) of entry
expressions.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999903055555556">
In section 2, we outline the main features of the
present study, first presenting a brief summary of
significant previous work on this topic. In section 3,
we propose and describe the criteria for selecting
MWEs and introduce a number of classes of
multiword expressions. In section 4, we outline the
format and contents of the JDMWE, discussing the
information on notational variants, syntactic
functions, syntactic structures, and the syntactic
flexibility of MWEs. In section 5, we describe and
explain the contextual conditions stipulated in the
JDMWE. In section 6, we illustrate some
important statistical properties of the JDMWE by
comparing the dictionary with a large-scale
Japanese N-gram frequency dataset, the
LDC2009T08, generated by Google Inc. (Kudo et
al. 2009). The paper ends with concluding remarks
in section 7.

Gross (1986) analyzed French compound adverbs
and compound verbs. According to his estimate,
the lexical stock of such words in French would be
respectively 3.3 and 1.7 times greater than that of
single-word adverbs and single-word verbs.
Jackendoff (1997) notes that an English speaker’s
lexicon would contain as many MWEs as single
words. Sag et al. (2002) pointed out that 41% of
the entries of WordNet 1.7 (Fellbaum 1999) are
multiword; and Uchiyama et al. (2003) reported
that 44% of Japanese verbs are VV-type
compounds. These and other similar observations
underscore the great need for a well-designed,
extensive MWE lexicon for practical natural
language processing.
In the past, attempts have been made to produce
an MWE dictionary. Examples include the
following: Gross (1986) reported on a dictionary of
French verbal MWEs with description of 22
syntactic structures; Kuiper et al. (2003)
constructed a database of 13,000 English idioms
tagged with syntactic structures; Villavicencio
(2004) attempted to compile lexicons of English
idioms and verb-particle constructions (VPCs) by
augmenting existing single-word dictionaries with
specific tables; Baptista et al. (2004) reported on a
dictionary of 3,500 Portuguese verbal MWEs with
ten syntactic structures; Fellbaum et al. (2006)
reported corpus-based studies in developing
German verb phrase idiom resources; and recently,
Laporte et al. (2008) have reported on a dictionary
of 6,800 French adverbial MWEs annotated with
15 syntactic structures.
Our JDMWE approach differs from these
studies in that it can treat more comprehensive
types of MWEs. Our system can handle almost all
types of MWEs except compositional compounds,
named entities, acronyms, blends, politeness
expressions, and functional expressions; in contrast,
the types of MWEs that most of the other studies
can deal with are limited to verb-object idioms,
VPCs, verbal MWEs, support-verb constructions
(SVCs) and so forth.
Many attempts have been made to extract
MWEs automatically using statistical corpus-based
methods. For example, Pantel et al. (2001) sought
to extract Chinese compounds using mutual
information and the log-likelihood measure. Fazly
et al. (2006) attempted to extract English verb-
object type idioms by recognizing their structural
fixedness in terms of mutual information and
relative entropy. Bannard (2007) tried to extract
English syntactically fixed verb-noun
combinations using pointwise mutual information,
and so on.
In spite of these and many similar efforts, it is
still difficult to adequately extract MWEs from
corpora using a statistical approach, because
regarding the types of multiword expressions,
realistically speaking, the corpus-wide distribution
can be far from exhaustive. Paradoxically, to
compile an MWE lexicon we need a reliable
standard MWE lexicon, as it is impossible to
evaluate the automatic extraction by recall rate
without such a reference. The conventional idiom
dictionaries published for human readers have been
occasionally used for the evaluation of automatic
extraction methods in some past studies. However,
no conventional Japanese dictionary of idioms
would suffice for an MWE lexicon for the practical
NLP because they lack entries related to the
diverse MWE objects we frequently encounter in
common textual materials, such as quasi-idioms,
quasi-clichés, metaphoric fixed or partly fixed
expressions. In addition, they provide no
systematic information on the notational variants,
syntactic functions, or syntactic structures of the
entry expressions. The JDMWE is intended to
circumvent these problems.
In past Japanese MWE studies, Shudo et al.
(1980) compiled a lexicon of 3,500 functional
multiword expressions and used the lexicon for a
morphological analysis of Japanese. Koyama et al.
(1998) made a seven-point increase in the
precision rate of kana-to-kanji conversion for a
commercial Japanese word processor by using a
prototype of the JDMWE with 65,000 MWEs.
Baldwin et al. (2003) discussed the treatment of
Japanese MWEs in the framework of Sag et al.
(2002). Shudo et al. (2004) pointed out the
importance of the auxiliary-verbal MWEs and their
non-propositional meanings (i.e., modality in a
generalized sense). Hashimoto et al. (2009)
studied a disambiguation method of semantically
ambiguous idioms using 146 basic idioms.

view of this, we have manually extracted
multiword expressions that have definite syntactic,
semantic, or communicative functions and are
linguistically idiosyncratic from a variety of
publications, such as newspaper articles, journals,
magazines, novels, and dictionaries. In principle,
the idiosyncrasy of MWEs is twofold: first, the
semantic non-compositionality (i.e., idiomaticity);
second, the strong probabilistic affinity between
component words. Here we have treated them
differently.
The number of words included in a MWE ranges
from two to eighteen. The length distribution is

In our approach, we use non-substitutability
criterion to define a word string as an MWE, the
logic being that an MWE expression is usually
fixed in its form and the substitution of one of its
constituent words would yield a meaningless
expression or an expression with a meaning that is
completely different from that of the original
MWE expression. Formally, a word string w1w2...
wi...wn (2&lt;n&lt;18) is an MWE if it has a definite
syntactic, semantic, or communicative function of
its own, and if w1w2 ... wi’ ... wn is either
meaningless or has a meaning completely different
from that of w1w2...wi...wn for some i, where wi’
is any synonym or synonymous phrase of wi. For
example, 赤(w1)-の-他人 aka-no-tanin (lit. “red
stranger”) is selected because it has a definite
nominal meaning of “complete stranger” and
neither 真紅(w1’)-の-他人 sinku-no-tanin nor レ
ッ ド (w1’)- の - 他 人 reddo-no-tanin means
“complete stranger”. The evaluation of semantic
relevance of MWEs was carried out by human
judges entirely. It is just too difficult to judge the
semantic relevance automatically and correctly.

<bodyText confidence="0.99996225">
An MWE must form a linguistic unit of its own.
This and the following transition probability
condition constitute another criterion that we adopt
to define what an MWE is. Formally, a word string
w1w2...wi...wn (2&lt;n&lt;18) is an MWE if it has a
definite syntactic, semantic, or communicative
function of its own, and if its forward or backward
transition probability pf(wi+1|w1...wi) or pb(wi|wi+1
...wn), respectively is judged to be in the relatively
high range for some i. With this definition, for
example, 手-を-拱く te-wo-komaneku “fold arms”
is selected as an MWE because it is a well-formed
verb phrase and pb( 手  |を - 拱 く ) is judged
empirically to be very high. No general
probabilistic threshold value can be fixed a priori
because the value is expression-dependent.
Although the probabilistic judgment was
performed, for each expression in turn, on the basis
of the developer’s empirical language model, the
resulting dataset is consistent with this criterion on

<bodyText confidence="0.999253333333333">
The JDMWE has approximately 104,000 entries,
one for each MWE, composed of six fields, namely,
Field-H, -N, -F, -S, -Cf, and -Cb. The dictionary
entry form of an MWE is stated in Field-H in the
form of a non-segmented hira-kana (phonetic
character) string. An example is given in Figure 3.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.930556">
4.1 Notational Information (Field-N)
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99981976">
Japanese has three notational options: hira-kana,
kata-kana, and kanji. The two kanas are
phonological syllabaries. Kanji are originally
Chinese idiographic characters. As we have many
kanji characters that are both homophonic and
synonymous, sentences can contain kanji
replaceable by others. In addition, the inflectional
suffix of some verbs can be absent in some
contexts. The JDMWE has flexible conventions to
cope with these characteristics. It uses brackets to
indicate an optional word (or a series of
interchangeable words marked off by the slash “/”)
in the Field-N description. Therefore, the entry
whose Field-H (the first field) is きのいいやつ ki-
no-ii-yatu (lit. “a guy who has a good spirit”)
“good-natured guy”, can have
(き/気)-の-(い/良/
好/善)い-(やつ/奴/ヤツ) in its Field-N. The dash
“-” is used as a word boundary indicator. This
example can stand for twenty-four combinatorial
variants, i.e., きのいいやつ,..., 気の良い奴,...,
気の善いヤツ.
If fully expanded with this information, the
JDMWE’s total number of MWEs can exceed
750,000.

4.3.2 Coordinate Structure
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9883069375">
Approximately 2,500 MWEs in the JDMWE
contain internal coordinate structures. This
information is described in Field-S by bracketing
with “&lt;” and “&gt;”, and the coordinated parts by “(”
and “)”. The coordinative phrase specification
usually requires that the conjuncts must be parallel
with respect to the syntactic function of the
constituents appearing in the bracketed description.
For example, an expression 後-は-野-と-なれ-山-
と-なれ ato-ha-no-to-nare-yama-to-nare (lit. “the
rest might become either a field or a mountain”)
“what will be, will be”, has an internal coordinate
structure. Thus, its Field-S is [[N ha]&lt;([[N to]
V60])([[N to] V60])&gt;]. This description represents
the structure shown in Figure 5, where V60 denotes
an imperative form of the verb.

4.3.3 Non-phrasal Structure
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999053125">
Approximately 250 MWEs in the JDMWE are
syntactically ill-formed in the sense of context-free
grammar but still form a syntactic unit on their
own. For example, 揺 り 籠 - か ら - 墓 場 - ま で
yurikago-kara-hakaba-made “from the cradle to
the grave” is an adjunct of two postpositional
phrases but is often used as a state-describing noun
as in 揺り籠-から-墓場-まで-の-保証 yurikago-
kara-hakaba-made-no-hoshou (lit. security of from
cradle to grave) “security from the cradle to the
grave”. Thus Field-F and Field-S have a functional
code Nk and a description [[N kara][[N made] $]],
respectively. The symbol “$” denotes a null
constituent occupying the position of the governor
on which this MWE depends. This structure is
shown in Figure 6.

4.3.4 Internal Modifiability
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998881388888889">
Some MWEs are not fixed-length word strings, but
allow the occurrence of phrasal modifiers
internally. In our system, this aspect is captured by
prefixing a modifiable element of the structural
description stated in the Field-S with an asterisk
“*”. An adverbial MWE 上-に-述べ-た-様-に ue-
ni-nobe-ta-you-ni “as I explained above” is one
such MWE and thus has a description [[[[[N ni]
*V23] ta] N] ni] in Field-S, meaning that the third
element V23 is a verb that can be modified
internally by adverb phrases. Since the asterisk

5 Contextual Condition (Field-Cf , Cb)
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999551210526316">
Approximately 6,700 MWEs need to be classified
differently because they require particular forward
contexts, i.e., they require co-occurrence of a
particular syntactic phrase in the context that
immediately precedes them. For example,
顔-を-
す る kao-wo-suru (lit. “do face”) which is a
support-verb construction, cannot occur without an
immediately preceding adnominal modifier, e.g.,
the adjective 悲しい kanasii “sad”, yielding 悲し
い-顔-を-する kanasii-kao-wo-suru (lit. “do sad
face”) “make a sad face”. This adnominal modifier
co-occurrence requirement is stipulated in Field-Cf
by a code &lt;adnom. modifier&gt;. There are about 30
of these forward contextual requirements.
Similarly, backward contextual requirements, of
which there are about 70, are stated in Field-Cb.
Approximately 300 MWEs require particular
backward contexts.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999581111111111">
Without a rule system of semantic composition, it
is difficult to evaluate the validity of the JDMWE
concerning idiomaticity. However, we can confirm
that 3,600 Japanese standard idioms that Sato
(2007) listed from five Japanese idiom dictionaries
published for human readers are included in the
JDMWE as a proper subset. In addition, the
JDMWE contains the information about their
syntactic functions, structures, and flexibilities.

6.1 Comparison with Web N-gram
Frequency Data
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999967117647059">
We examined the statistical properties of the
JDMWE using the Japanese Web N-gram, version
1: LDC2009T08, which is a word N-gram (1&lt;N&lt;7)
frequency dataset generated from 2 × 1010
sentences in a Japanese Web corpus, supplied by
Google Inc. (Kudo et al. 2009). We will refer to
this (or the Web corpus examined) subsequently as
GND. We will refer to trigram w1w2w3 as an NpV-
trigram only when w1 and w3 are restricted to a
noun and a verb (end form), respectively, and w2 is
one of the following case-particles: accusative を
wo, subjective が ga, or dative に ni.5 We write the
number of occurrences of an expression x, counted
in the GND, as C(x).
First, we obtain from the GND sets G, T, D, B,
and R;’s defined below, using a Japanese word
dictionary IPADIC (Asahara et al. 2003):
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.746274666666667">
G={w1w2w3 |w1w2w3 ∊ GND, w1w2w3 is an
NpV-trigram.}
T={w1w2w3 |w1w2w3 ∊ JDMWE, w1w2w3 is an
NpV-trigram.}
D={w1w2|∃w3, w1w2w3∊ G}
B={w1w2|∃w3, w1w2w3∊ T}
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.91968324">
R;={w1w2w3 |w1w2w3∊ T, C(w1w2w3) is the i-th
largest among C(w1w2v)’s for all w1w2v ∊ G}.
We then found the following data:
・|B|=10,548
・|D|=110,822
・|R1|=4,983, |R2|=1,495, |R3|=786, |R4|=433, ...
From these, we realize, for example, that 47.2%
=(|R1|/|B|)X100 of trigrams in T have verbs that
occur most frequently in the GND, succeeding the
individual bigrams. An example of such a trigram
is アクション-を-起こす akushon-wo-okosu (lit.
“raise action”) “take action”. Similarly, 14.0%=
(|R2|/|B|)X100 have the second most frequent verbs,
7.5% have the third most frequent verbs, and so on.
Figure 8(a) illustrates the results. From this, we can
assume that the higher probability Pf(w3|w1w2) a
trigram w1w2w3 has, the more likely w3 is chosen
for each w1w2 in the JDMWE. This is consistent
with what we wrote in section 3.2. Figure 8(b) is
the accumulative substitute of Figure 8(a).
Extrapolating Figure 8(b) suggests that 10% of
NpV-trigrams in the JDMWE do not occur in the
GND. This implies that the size, i.e., 2X1010
sentences of the Web corpus used by the GND is
not sufficiently large to allow MWE extraction. 6
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.719827333333333">
5 The NpV-trigrams represent the typical forms of shortest
Japanese sentences, corresponding roughly to subject-verb,
verb-object/direct, and verb-object/indirect constructions in
English.
6 Otherwise, the frequency cut-off point of 20 adopted in GND
is too high.

Second, we calculate the (normalized) entropy
Hf(w3|w1w2) for each w1w2 c D defined below,
where the probability Pf(w3|w1w2) is estimated by
C(w1w2w3)/C(w1w2). This provides a measure of
the flatness of the Pf(w3|w1w2) distribution
canceling out the influence of the number N of
verb types w3’s.
Hf(w3|w1w2)
= − ( Pf(w3|w1w2) log Pf(w3|w1w2)) / log N
After arranging 110,822 bigrams in D in ascending
order of Hf(w3|w1w2), we divided them into 20
intervals A1, A2, ... , A20 each with an equal number
of bigrams (5,542). We then examined how many
bigrams in B were included in each interval.
Figures 9(a) and (b) plot the resulting constituent
ratio of the bigrams in B and the mean value of
Hf(w3|w1w2)’s in each interval, respectively. We
found, for example, that 1,262 out of 5,542
bigrams are in B for the first interval, i.e., the
constituent ratio is 22.8%=(1,262/5,542) X 100.
Similarly, we obtain 22.5%=(1,248/5,542) X 100
for the second interval, 20.5%=(1,136/5,542)X100
for the third, and so on. From this, we realize the
macroscopic tendency that the larger the entropy
Hf(w3|w1w2), or equivalently the perplexity of the
succeeding verb w3, a bigram w1w2 has, the less
likely it is adopted as a prefix of a trigram in T.
Taking the results in Figure 8 and Figure 9
together, we can presume that not only frequently

This suggests the general feasibility of the
JDMWE, for its relative compactness, in
effectively disambiguating the syntactic structures
of input word strings.
The above investigations were carried out on the
forward conditional probabilities for restricted
types of MWEs. However, the results imply a
general validity of the JDMWE since the same
criteria for selection were applied to all kinds of
multiword expressions.

<bodyText confidence="0.9998502">
The JDMWE is a slotted tree bank for
idiosyncratic multiword expressions, annotated
with detailed notational, syntactic information.
The idea underlying the JDMWE is that the
volume and meticulousness of the lexical resource
crucially affects the outcome of the rule-oriented,
large-scale NLP. In view of this, the JDMWE was
designed to encompass the wide range of linguistic
objects related to Japanese MWEs, by placing
importance on the recall rate in the selection of the
