An Introduction to Machine Translation covers the linguistic and computational technol-
ogy of machine translation and gives a basic survey of relevant systems and research
projects. It starts systematically with linguistics and the problematic aspects of under-
standing languages, and continues with accepted computational techniques for ana-
lyzing language. The chapter on basic strategies describes established architectures in
system design. The chapter on analysis concentrates on the linguistic problems and the
knowledge available to solve these. The chapter on transfer and interlingua describes
contrastive problems concerning the translation of languages and how MT approaches
them. Generation of natural language is briefly mentioned—understandably so, since
MT has been an application where, with the exception of a few systems, generation
has been reduced to the level of a morphological process. In the chapter &amp;quot;Practical
use of MT systems,&amp;quot; the modes of operation, or the way in which the user interacts
with the system, are brought forth, not the actual use of a system in an end-user en-
vironment. The chapter on MT evaluation gives good insight into the many ways in
which a system can be evaluated and the different values that have to be considered
depending on who is evaluating what.
The last nine chapters of the book describe current systems and research projects.
These chapters cover work on MT during the past as carried out in the Western world,
regrettably neglecting Asian systems and research, even if that is in quantitative terms
larger than all other work in MT combined. The last chapter briefly mentions new
directions of research and gives perhaps the best guidelines for further reading. But
here the suggestions are rather dated and the reader is well advised to look for more-
recent publications by the authors who are mentioned in Section 18.10.
An introduction is seldom written without different opinions about what to in-
clude. The interested reader will always find that he or she wants more information,
and achieving that must be the ultimate goal of an introduction. However, there is a
contextual discrepancy in the book between the theoretical solutions put forth in the
linguistic introduction and the practical solutions applied in the systems described.
The authors maintain a focus on syntactic theory, whereas the practical systems that
have been commercially successful are mostly nontheoretical in their syntactic ap-
proach and rely heavily on lexical pragmatics. Thus the book implies that syntactic
theory is more established in MT than it really is. This is a controversial problem in
MT research and development: on the one hand, how to make MT theoretically re-
Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 2
spectable and on the other, how to prove that linguistics, mostly syntax, is the best
technical approach for MT. This influences developers to be secretive about their sys-
tem technology, and researchers to strive to make a theoretically &apos;correct&apos; system, but
without much success. In fact four of the eight systems described here in detail—SUSY,
Ariane, Rosetta, and DLT—have not made the market in spite of excellent linguistic
design. Assuming that MT implies some contrastive research, Eurotra has no bearing
upon MT (Eurotra Assessment Panel Report 1993). Systran, in spite of its unorthodox
linguistics, Mete°, with its small domain, and Metal, with its extensive lexical coding
(which is clearly understated in this book) are systems that are currently being used as
practical systems. All share some sort of simplification as regards linguistic splendor.
Current statistical approaches to MT are very briefly mentioned. They deserve
a more in-depth treatment, so that the reader may understand the simplicity of the
approach and its limitations regarding improved translation quality beyond what is
already achieved.
The shortcomings of this book, which are always subjective, do not outweigh
its relevance. It is the best existing basic course book for an introduction to MT, for
students who have a basic training in linguistics and, preferably, some knowledge of
computer science. It is very well written and easy to read. The content of the book is
systematic and well structured. The references to further reading at the end of each
chapter are extremely useful. For lecturers giving basic courses on machine translation,
this is a long-needed addition to the literature.
