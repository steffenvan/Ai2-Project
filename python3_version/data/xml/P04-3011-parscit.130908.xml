Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.99998455">
We describe two experiments using French
noun-noun combinations which parallel a
study carried out by Gagné (2001) using
English combinations. The order of the
modifier and head noun are reversed in
French, allowing us to investigate whether the
influence of relation priming that Gagné found
is due to the order of the modifier and head
noun or whether it is due to their different
functional roles. While our findings indicate
that interpretation is influenced by previous
exposure to combinations incorporating one of
the same constituent nouns, the results show
that primes with the same modifier have a
greater influence when associated with a
different relation to the target. This pattern of
influence is similar to that found in English
and suggests that the modifier is exclusively
involved in relation selection, irrespective of
its order in a combination.

1 Introduction

The combination of two existing words is a
productive strategy used by speakers to convey
new concepts and extend the limits of the
vernacular. The process of understanding these
novel compounds is worthy of study, both because
it is intimately associated with the creativity of
language use and because it provides a constrained
domain in which to test cognitive theories of
conceptual representation and language
comprehension. In English compounds, the first
word or modifier attaches further meaning to the
second word or head, thus creating a reference to
the intended concept. In order to interpret a
nominal compound such as “mountain stream”,
people must find a relation to link the compound’s
head and modifier. Several different theories have
been proposed as to how people find the correct
relation with which to link the constituent nouns.
Gagné and Shoben’s (1997) Competition Among
Relations In Nominals (CARIN) theory maintains
that there is a fixed, relatively small taxonomy of
standard relations that can be used to link the

modifier and head noun concepts. According to
this theory, the representation of the modifier
concept includes statistical knowledge about those
relations with which the modifier tends to be used
during conceptual combinations. The most
available standard relation is the one most
frequently used to interpret other compounds
containing that same modifier. For instance, the
modifier “mountain” is most often associated with
the &lt;head LOCATED modifier&gt; relation thus
making the combination “mountain stream” easier
to interpret than “mountain magazine” which uses
the &lt;head ABOUT modifier&gt; relation.
Important evidence in support of the CARIN
model is the finding that the modifier’s relational
distribution influences the ease with which a
combined concept can be interpreted. Gagné and
Shoben (1997) found that combinations involving
a relation used frequently with the modifier were
easier to interpret than combinations involving a
less frequent relation, while the frequency
distribution of the head noun had no influence.
This raises the question as to why it should be the
case that the frequencies of relations associated
with the modifier affect ease of interpretation, but
not those of the head noun. Gagné and Shoben
(1997) suggest that the modifier may have more of
an influence than the head noun because it is
encountered first and consequently highly frequent
relations for the modifier may become activated
prior to frequent relations for the head noun. A
second possibility they suggest is that the modifier
noun has certain associated properties which give
it a semantic privilege in determining the meaning
of a combination. One way to test both of these
hypotheses is to examine the interpretation of
combinations in a language in which the order of
the nouns is the reverse of that in English. We
adopt such an approach by examining the
interpretation of combinations in the French
language in order to determine which of the above
possibilities can account for Gagné and Shoben’s
findings.
The following experiments parallel a speeded
sensibility study by Gagné (2001) which
investigated the ways in which recent exposure to a
similar combination influences the processing of a
subsequent combination. Gagné found that when
the prime and the target had the same head noun,
there was no significant difference in reaction
times between the cases where they shared the
same relation and cases where they did not.
However, when the modifier was the repeated
constituent, primes that used the same relation
exerted more influence than those that used a
different relation. Thus, “mountain stream” was
more effective than “mountain magazine” at
priming “mountain goat” while “kitchen chair”
and “wood chair” were equally effective at
priming “garden chair”. Gagné concluded that
when the prime and target share the same modifier,
relation priming increases the availability of a
selected relation within the modifier’s relational
distribution. We replicate Gagné’s study in French
in order to determine whether the same effect will
be observed.
While conceptual combination in the English
language involves the straightforward juxtaposition
of two nouns, combinations in French are made up
of three separate elements, namely the head, the
modifier and a linking preposition. The preposition
gives some indication of the relation between the
two concepts as different prepositions are used
with different relations. The three French
prepositions typically used are “de”, “à” and
“en”. While the use of a preposition in French can
bias the selection of a particular relation, we have
controlled for this by choosing materials
exclusively associated with the “de” preposition,
which can be used with almost all relations.
Consequently this eliminates any alternative
influences on relation selection other than those
exerted by the modifier and the head.

Two separate experiments were carried out. In
the first, the prime had the same head as the target
and in the second, the modifier was the repeated
constituent. In both experiments, there were three
conditions. In one condition the prime used the
same relation as the target; in another it used a
different relation. There was also a neutral
condition in which the target combination was
preceded by a combination with no common noun
constituent. The experimental design follows that
of Gagné (2001) and facilitates the analysis of the
relative amounts of priming derived from a
combination containing the same head or the same
modifier as the target. Priming was evaluated by
comparing each of the first two conditions with the
neutral condition and by comparing response times
to target combinations in the same-relation
condition with response times to target
combinations in the different-relation condition.

2.1 Method
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998902727272727">
Materials. In both experiments, sixty
combined concepts were created as targets. For
each target combination, three prime combinations
were constructed. One used the same relation as
the target and either the same head (experiment 1)
or the same modifier (experiment 2). Similarly,
another combination used a different relation. The
control combination shared no noun constituent
with the target. Three lists of stimuli were arranged
such that there was an equal number of each prime
type in each list. Across all three lists, each target
was seen with each type of prime combination.
Our materials were controlled for plausibility and
familiarity. Two raters scored the plausibility and
familiarity of the referents of the prime
combinations on a Likert scale from 1 to 7. A two-
sided Wilcoxon signed-ranks test revealed no
reliable differences between conditions for
plausibility, familiarity or average syllable length
(p &gt; 0.05).
Procedure. Each participant was exposed to
one of the lists and hence saw each target item only
once. The pairs of prime and target items were
presented in a randomised order along with 60
filler pairs and the complete set of filler pairs was
presented to each individual. Participants sat in
front of a computer screen and placed the index
finger of their left hand on the F key of the
keyboard and the index finger of their right hand
on the J key. Participants were told that J
corresponded to “Juste” and F corresponded to
“Faux”. Trial presentation was self-paced.
Following exposure to the prime combination,
participants indicated whether it had a sensible,
literal interpretation by pressing the appropriate
key. Subsequently, the target combination was
similarly displayed and participants made another
sensibility judgment. There was nothing in the
method of presentation to suggest any connection
between consecutive combinations.
Participants. 36 native French speakers
participated, 18 in each experiment (ages 20-31, M
= 24.2). This selection consisted of students and
teachers based in Ireland.

9.1% of trials were excluded from the analysis.
0.8% of trials were rejected because participants
pressed a key other than J or F. Additionally, 4.6%
of trials were excluded in cases where the response
“faux” was incorrectly given. Responses deemed
unreasonably fast (&lt; 400ms; 0.2%) and
unreasonably slow (&gt; 4000ms; 0.9%) were also
excluded. After eliminating all trials which did not
meet the above criteria, any response times which
were more than three standard deviations outside
each participant’s mean were also rejected. This
eliminated another 2.6% of responses. A repeated
measures ANOVA test was conducted to examine
the effect of prime type on sense-nonsense
judgments for each experiment. Tables 1 and 2

Evidence of priming. Responses to the target
combination were faster when the prime and target
shared a constituent noun. In the first experiment,
the 159ms difference between the same-relation
and neutral conditions was reliable, Fsubject(1, 34) =
31.70, p &lt; .01; Fitem(1, 118) = 27.30, p &lt; .01. The
154ms difference between the different-relation
and neutral conditions was also reliable, Fsubject(1,
34) = 22.22, p &lt; .01; Fitem(1, 118) = 27.309, p &lt;
.01. In the second experiment the 64 ms difference
between the same-relation and neutral conditions
was reliable, Fsubject(2, 34) = 9.248, p &lt; .05; Fitem(2,
118) = 11.437, p &lt; .05. However, the 19 ms
difference between the different-relation and
neutral conditions was not reliable, Fsubject(2, 34) =
.587, p &gt; .05; Fitem(2, 118) = .337, p &gt; .05.
Relation influence. As predicted by the CARIN
theory, the first experiment, in which the head was
the repeated constituent, revealed no evidence of
relation influence. No significant difference was
found between response times to target
1 The relation of the neutral condition was considered
irrelevant following Gagné’s (2001) finding that
priming does not occur when the preceding combination
does not share either of the target’s constituent nouns
combinations in the same-relation and in the
neutral conditions. The 5ms difference between the
two conditions was not reliable (Fs &lt; 1). However,
in the repeated modifier experiment the target was
easier to interpret when it was preceded by a
combination with the same relation than when it
was preceded by one with a different relation.
Participants responded to targets following the
same relation prime 45ms quicker than they did to
targets following the different relation prime,
Fsubject(2, 34) = 4.349, p &lt; .05; Fitem(2, 118) =
4.194, p &lt; .05. These data indicate that French
speakers are only sensitive to relational
information associated with the modifier.
Summary. The results of the two experiments
show that the influence of a recently viewed
combination is affected by its relation only in cases
where the target shares the same modifier
(experiment 2) and not in cases where it shares the
same head (experiment 1). Thus “ruisseau de
montagne” (mountain stream) was more effective
than “chaussures de montagne” (mountain shoes)
at priming “glacier de montagne” (mountain
glacier) while “sac de voyage” (travel bag) and
“sac de cuir” (leather bag) were equally effective
at priming “sac de sport” (sports bag). These
results are similar to those of Gagné (2001) and are
thus consistent with research in the English
language indicating that relational information is
associated with the modifier and not with the head
noun. Since these effects have been replicated in a
language in which the order of the modifier and
head are reversed, this suggests that modifiers and
head nouns maintain the same role in the process
of interpretation regardless of the order in which
they are realised. Our findings confirm that
relational information is a tangible feature of
conceptual combinations and that the association
between the modifier and the relation is an intrinsic
property that is evident regardless of the order of
the constituent nouns.

3 General Discussion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999975710526316">
While our results correspond with those of
Gagné (2001), we interpret them differently. In her
study Gagné distinguished two priming effects,
namely lexical priming and relation priming. She
claimed that when the head noun was repeated,
only lexical priming was observed but that when
the modifier was repeated, both types of priming
were evident. This distinction is not necessary. It is
simpler to suppose that the repeated-modifier
different-relation condition exhibits an interference
effect which diminishes the effectiveness of lexical
priming. Such an interference could arise for two
reasons, neither of which requires an assumption of
relation priming. The first possibility is that
combinations using a different relation elicit no
priming because a different sense of the modifier is
associated with each relation. For example, the
French term “en chocolat” (made of chocolate)
has very different connotations to “à chocolat”
(for chocolate) or “de chocolat” (of chocolate).
While these terms employ the same modifier, they
each have different meanings since the preposition
immediately elucidates the modifying capacity of
the noun. Though the relation associated with a
modifier in English may not be expressed in the
same way, the conceptual disparity is likely to
persist nonetheless. It is therefore conceivable that
the relation with which the modifier is associated
can change its meaning and as a result, one
modifier might not necessarily prime a
combination using the same modifier in a different
sense.
A second possibility is that the availability of
one meaning of a modifier is increased after
encountering a prime using it with that sense.
When the same modifier is encountered being used
with a different sense in the target, the original
sense is more accessible than the appropriate one.
Hence, following the prime “sel de mer” (sea salt),
participants may find it more difficult to interpret
“mal de mer” (sea sickness) because they are more
likely to assume the “from the sea” sense of the
modifier instead of the correct “caused by the sea”
interpretation. An explanation of our results may
be due to a combination of the above possibilities,
both of which emphasise the co-dependence of the
modifier and its associated relation.
While our results have emphasised the link
between modifier and relation, they do not suggest
that modifier relational frequency is the only factor
involved in selecting a plausible relation and it is
likely that both the head and the modifier are
involved in this process. In order to develop an
accurate computational model of conceptual
combination, future studies will need to consider
the influence of other contributing factors. Certain
heads and modifiers are strongly biased towards
suggesting one particular relation. For instance,
modifiers denoting substances are biased towards
the &lt;head MADE OF modifier&gt; relation (e.g.
“plastic”) and in the same way, head nouns with a
strongly associated schema, such as “factory”, can
be biased towards suggesting a certain relation.
Furthermore, relation likelihood may be influenced
by the presence of facilitating features (Devereux
&amp; Costello, 2004). Facilitating features are those
features of a pair of concepts that are necessary for
a given relation to be possible. For example a
compound with the modifier “kitchen” is unlikely
to be interpreted using the &lt;head MADE OF
modifier&gt; relation since kitchens are not a type of
substance. Computational models of conceptual
combination may have to account for the
characteristics of heads and modifiers individually
in order to simulate the ways in which each
constituent influences relation selection.

4 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999964">
In summary, we investigated the influence of
relation priming on the interpretation of French
noun-noun compounds in order to ascertain
whether the influence of the modifier observed in
studies of English stems from its functional
properties rather than the fact that it is encountered
first. Our results showed that same and different-
relation primes were equally effective when they
shared the same head as the target, but that when
they shared the same modifier the different-relation
primes were less effective. This is consistent with
findings from studies of English and suggests that
the properties of the modifier and head noun
remain consistent regardless of their order in a
combination. While our results agree with
predictions of the CARIN theory, we speculate that
this effect may be due to different senses of the
modifier being appropriate depending on its
associated relation. Consequently modifiers using
different relations are less effective at priming
targets with the same relation used in a different
sense.
