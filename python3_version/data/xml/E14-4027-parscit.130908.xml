Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.9984595">
In this paper, we investigate the problem of
Ezafe recognition in Persian language. Ezafe is
an unstressed vowel that is usually not written,
but is intelligently recognized and pronounced
by human. Ezafe marker can be placed into
noun phrases, adjective phrases and some
prepositional phrases linking the head and
modifiers. Ezafe recognition in Persian is
indeed a homograph disambiguation problem,
which is a useful task for some language
applications in Persian like TTS. In this paper,
Part of Speech tags augmented by Ezafe
marker (POSE) have been used to train a
probabilistic model for Ezafe recognition. In
order to build this model, a ten million word
tagged corpus was used for training the
system. For building the probabilistic model,
three different approaches were used;
Maximum Entropy POSE tagger, Conditional
Random Fields (CRF) POSE tagger and also a
statistical machine translation approach based
on parallel corpus. It is shown that comparing
to previous works, the use of CRF POSE
tagger can achieve outstanding results.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999494409090909">
In Persian language, Ezafe is an unstressed
short vowel /-e/ (or /-ye/ after vowels) which is
used to link two words in some contexts.
Although Ezafe is an important part of the
Persian phonology and morphology, it does not
have a specific character representation, and so is
not usually written. However, it is pronounced as
a short vowel /e/. Sometimes, for disambiguation
purposes it is preferred to explicitly mark its
presence by a written symbol (the diacritic Kasre)
after some words in order to facilitate the correct
pronunciation.
The most important application of Ezafe
recognition is a text to phoneme tool for Text To
Speech (TTS) Systems. Other application of
Ezafe recognition is identifying the dependency
of a word in a Noun Phrase. (Oskouipour, 2011,
Mavvaji and Eslami, 2012)
In this research, we would like to investigate
various approaches to correctly recognize
genitive cases in Persian language. Shortly, the
contributions of this paper are as follow:

• Modeling the Ezafe recognition task as a

• Using HMM and CRF as sequence labelers.
• Modeling the Ezafe recognition task as a

• Using a big amount of test and gold data, so
the results are considerably reliable.
• To enhance the results of the system, five

results in comparison to the previous works.
This task is closely related to the task of
determining short vowels in Arabic language. So,
although the aim of this paper is to recognize
Ezafe in Persian language, but all the methods
investigated here is applicable to determine short
vowels in Arabic language.
In the next section a clear definition of the
problem is presented and the characteristics of
Persian language are introduced. In Section 3 we
will give a precise definition of Ezafe. Section 4
provides an overview of previous works on
Ezafe recognition. Our approach will be
described in Section 5 followed by two sections
including corpus selection process and
implementation of proposed method. Conclusion
and recommendations for future works will be
presented in the last section.

2 An Overview of Persian Language
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99979325">
Persian Language belongs to Arabic script-
based languages. This category of languages
includes Kurdish, Urdu, Arabic, Pashtu and
Persian. They all have common scripting, and
somehow similar writing system.
In Arabic script-based languages, the most
common features are absence of capitalization,
right to left direction, lack of clear word
boundaries, complex word structure, encoding
issues in computer environment, and a high
degree of ambiguity due to non-representation of
short vowels in writing (Farghaly, 2004). Note
that Ezafe recognition and homograph
disambiguation problem mostly deals with the
last mentioned feature.
One of the problems in Persian language
processing is long-distance dependencies. This
phenomenon complicates Ezafe recognition task
even for humans (Ghomeshi, 1996). Another
problem is how to determine phrase/word
boundaries. In Persian language, affixes can be
written in three formats; completely separated by
a space delimiter, separated by half-space1, or
can be attached to its main word. So, determining
word and phrase boundaries are somehow a
complicated task in Persian.The third challenge
arises by pronoun drop due to the morphology of
Persian language.

3 Ezafe Definition
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999816">
Historically, Persian Ezafe had a
demonstrative morpheme in old Iran (Estaji and
Jahangiri, 2006). It was related to a demonstrative
/hya/, which links the head noun to adjectival
modifiers, to the possessor NP (Samvelian, P.,
2007). In evolution of Persian language, /hya/
became /–i/ in Middle Persian and progressively
lost its demonstrative value to end as a simple
linker. In recognizing Ezafe, we should consider
all morphological, syntactic, semantic and
discourse views (Parsafar, 2010). It should be
noted that Ezafe can be iterated within the NP,
occurring as many times as there are modifiers.

4 Previous Works
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999314">
As a first attempt to recognize Ezafe in Persian
text, Bijankhan (Bijankhan, 2005) used a pattern
matching algorithm for Ezafe recognition. He
has used POS tags and also semantic labels (such
as place, time, ordinal numbers ...) to obtain a

<bodyText confidence="0.997077060606061">
statistical view of Ezafe markers. He manually
derived 80 most frequent patterns such as Noun-
Noun and Noun-Adjective etc. The most
frequent combinations were extracted based on a
10 million-wordscorpus.
In a research accomplished by (Isapour, et al.,
2007), the researchers rely on the fact that Ezafe
can relate between head and its modifiers so as to
help to build NPs. So by parsing sentences and
finding Phrase borders, the location of Ezafe in
the sentence can be found. In this work, the
sentences were analyzed using a Probabilistic
Context Free Grammar (PCFG) to derive phrase
borders. Then based on the extracted parse tree,
the head and modifiers in each phrase can be
determined. In the last phase, a rule based
approach was also applied to increase the
accuracy in Ezafe marker labeling. For training
the algorithm, 1000 sentences were selected and
a parse tree was built for each of them. Because
of the limited number of parsed sentences for
training, the results cannot be extended for
general applications.
There were also other attempts to effectively
recognize Ezafe marker in Persian text, such as
(Zahedi, 1998) based on fuzzy sets. Also,
(Oskouipour, 2011) developed a system based on
Hidden Markove Model to correctly identify
Ezafe markers. (Mavvaji and Eslami, 2012) had
another attempt by syntactic analysis. There are
also some implementations using neural
networks (Razi and Eshqi, 2012). Some of the
results can be seen in Table 4.

5 Our Approach
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.988762789473684">
In this paper we have investigated two types
of POS taggers, and also a MT-based approach.
In the following section, these approaches will be
explained and the results will be compared to
previous work.
A. Ezafe recognition as a POS tagging problem
Part Of Speech tagging is an effective way for
automatically assigning grammatical tags to
words in a text. In Persian, POS tagging can be
applied as a homograph disambiguation problem
for correct pronunciation of words in a sentence
(Yarowsky, 1996). There are powerful POS
tagger algorithms such as statistical, rule based,
transformation based and memory based learning
methods. In this research we have used two
schemes of statistical POS tagging for Ezafe
recognition. The first one is a Maximum Entropy
tagger that has been investigated by (Toutanova
and Manning. 2000) and (Toutanova, et al.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.995473">
139
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.979073230769231">
2003). In order to implement this approach, we
have used Stanford toolkit as a MaxEnt tagger.
The second approach is based on Conditional
Random Fields (CRF) model, that was first
introduced by (Lafferty, et al., 2001) and then
(Sha and Pereira. 2003).
B. Ezafe recognition as a translation problem
We can consider the Ezafe recognition
problem as a monotone translation problem. In
other words, it can be considered as a noisy
channel problem. The original training text
without the Ezafe marker can be used as source
language, and the tagged text can be used as
destination language. So, we can apply these
parallel corpora as inputs to a phrase-based
Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) system.
In the experiments, we have used monotone
SMT with distortion limit equal to zero. For
implementing SMT, we have used Moses toolkit.
It should be mentioned that in the case of Ezafe
recognition, we can use a SMT system without
re-ordering. By using phrase-based SMT, the
local dependencies between the neighboring
words are handled by the phrase table. Also some
of the dependencies between different phrases
can be tackled by the language model.

6 Data Preparation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9993552">
In this work, we have used Bijankhan corpus
(Bijankhan, 2004, Amiri, et al, 2007). The
content of this corpus is gathered from daily news
and common texts, covering 4300 different
subjects. It contains about 10 million tagged
words in about 370000 sentences. The words in
the corpus have been tagged by 550 tags based on
a hierarchical order, with more fine-grained POS
tags like ‘noun-plural-subj’. About 23% of words
in the corpus are tagged with Ezafe. We have
used an extended version of POS tags, named
POSE (Part of Speech tags + Ezafe tag) that can
be constructed by adding Ezafe markers to
original first level tags. Table 1 shows the
statistics of POSE tags.

<bodyText confidence="0.999927076923077">
The ordinary measures that can be used based
on confusion matrix are Precision, Recall and F1
measure. Another measure that can be used in
this binary classification problem is Mathews
Correlation Coefficient (MCC). This measure
indicates the quality of the classifier for binary
class problems especially when two classes are of
very different sizes.We have also considered two
other measures; true positive rate as Ezafe
presence accuracy, and false positive rate as
Ezafe absence accuracy. The total average can be
calculated using a weighted average of the two
last mentioned measures.

8 Experiments and Results
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.989612608695652">
As mentioned, the system was trained on
Bijankhan corpus. Only the first level of POS
tags was used for the training phase, except for
the words with Ezafe, that the POS plus Ezafe
marker was chosen. The more fine-grained POS
tags were removed to achieve more accuracy.
We used a ten-fold cross-validation scheme.
For calculating the total accuracy, Ezafe presence
accuracy and Ezafe absence accuracy should be
weighted by 16.8% (ratio of words with Ezafe
marker in test corpus) and 83.2% (ratio of words
without Ezafe marker) respectively.
A. Evaluating fine-grained tags
The first experiment was done in order to test
the ability of other fine grained POS tags in Ezafe
recognition. In this test that was done on 30% of
the corpus, all of the fine grained POS tags of the
words plus Ezafe marker were used to train a
Maximum Entropy POSE tagger. As shown in
Table 2, the accuracy of the system decreased
when we used complete features hierarchy. So, in
consequent experiments, we used only first level
tag features.

The effect of eliminating titles which are
incomplete sentences was also experimented.
Table 3 shows that eliminating the titlesdoes not
achieve a good improvement in accuracy.
C. Using Persian-specific features
Augmenting the system with some Persian-
specific features to decrease FP and FN can
significantly increase the total accuracy. As
shown in Table 3, by using five features, the
a
ccuracy can be increased by more than 0.6%.
The features are as follow:

In this experiment, we used a CRF tagger and
applied a window on the text to see the effect of
neighboring words as input features in Ezafe
recognition. As shown in Figure 1
, the accuracy
of system varies by changing the size of the
window from 1 to 9. The graph shows that the
experiments with a CRF tagger can achieve its

<bodyText confidence="0.999754533333333">
In this paper, we proposed a POSE tagging
approach to recognize Ezafe in Persian sentences.
Besides to this probabilistic approach, some
features were extracted to increase the
recognition accuracy. Experimental results show
that CRF tagger acts pretty well in Persian Ezafe
recognition. The obtained results show
outstanding performance comparing to earlier
approaches and the accuracy is quite reliable
because of training based on a 10 million-words
corpus.Future research can be done based on
other taggers such as log-linear and TnT taggers.
Moreover, Ezafe recognition can be viewed as a
spell checking problem.S o, a spell checker can
also be used as another approach.

Ezafe marker can be placed into noun phrases, adjective phrases and some prepositional phrases linking the head and modifiers. Ezafe recognition in Persian is indeed a homograph disambiguation problem, which is a useful task for some language applications in Persian like TTS. In this paper, Part of Speech tags augmented by Ezafe marker (POSE) have been used to train a probabilistic model for Ezafe recognition. In order to build this model, a ten million word tagged corpus was used for training the system. For building the probabilistic model, three different approaches were used; Maximum Entropy POSE tagger, Conditional Random Fields (CRF) POSE tagger and also a statistical machine translation approach based on parallel corpus. It is shown that comparing to previous works, the use of CRF POSE tagger can achieve outstanding results.</abstract>

In the experiments, we have used monotone SMT with distortion limit equal to zero. For implementing SMT, we have used Moses toolkit. It should be mentioned that in the case of Ezafe recognition, we can use a SMT system without re-ordering. By using phrase-based SMT, the local dependencies between the neighboring words are handled by the phrase table. Also some of the dependencies between different phrases can be tackled by the language model. 6 Data Preparation In this work, we have used Bijankhan corpus (Bijankhan, 2004, Amiri, et al, 2007). The content of this corpus is gathered from daily news and common texts, covering 4300 different subjects. It contains about 10 million tagged words in about 370000 sentences. The words in the corpus have been tagged by 550 tags based on a hierarchical order, with more fine-grained POS tags like ‘noun-plural-subj’. About 23% of words in the corpus are tagged with Ezafe. We have used an extended version of POS tags, named POSE (Part of Speech tags + Ezafe tag) that can be constructed by adding Ezafe markers to original first level tags.

It was related to a demonstrative /hya/, which links the head noun to adjectival modifiers, to the possessor NP (Samvelian, P., 2007). In evolution of Persian language, /hya/ became /–i/ in Middle Persian and progressively lost its demonstrative value to end as a simple linker. In recognizing Ezafe, we should consider all morphological, syntactic, semantic and discourse views (Parsafar, 2010). It should be noted that Ezafe can be iterated within the NP, occurring as many times as there are modifiers. 4 Previous Works As a first attempt to recognize Ezafe in Persian text, Bijankhan (Bijankhan, 2005) used a pattern matching algorithm for Ezafe recognition. He has used POS tags and also semantic labels (such as place, time, ordinal numbers ...) to obtain a 1A Non-Joint Zero Width (NJZW) letter statistical view of Ezafe markers. He manually derived 80 most frequent patterns such as NounNoun and Noun-Adjective etc. The most frequent combinations were extracted based on a 10 million-wordscorpus. In a research accomplished by (Isapour, et al., 2007), the researchers rely on the fact that Ezafe can relate between head and its modifiers so as to help to build NPs.

In the following section, these approaches will be explained and the results will be compared to previous work. A. Ezafe recognition as a POS tagging problem Part Of Speech tagging is an effective way for automatically assigning grammatical tags to words in a text. In Persian, POS tagging can be applied as a homograph disambiguation problem for correct pronunciation of words in a sentence (Yarowsky, 1996). There are powerful POS tagger algorithms such as statistical, rule based, transformation based and memory based learning methods. In this research we have used two schemes of statistical POS tagging for Ezafe recognition. The first one is a Maximum Entropy tagger that has been investigated by (Toutanova and Manning. 2000) and (Toutanova, et al. 139 2003). In order to implement this approach, we have used Stanford toolkit as a MaxEnt tagger. The second approach is based on Conditional Random Fields (CRF) model, that was first introduced by (Lafferty, et al., 2001) and then (Sha and Pereira. 2</context>

Then based on the extracted parse tree, the head and modifiers in each phrase can be determined. In the last phase, a rule based approach was also applied to increase the accuracy in Ezafe marker labeling. For training the algorithm, 1000 sentences were selected and a parse tree was built for each of them. Because of the limited number of parsed sentences for training, the results cannot be extended for general applications. There were also other attempts to effectively recognize Ezafe marker in Persian text, such as (Zahedi, 1998) based on fuzzy sets. Also, (Oskouipour, 2011) developed a system based on Hidden Markove Model to correctly identify Ezafe markers. (Mavvaji and Eslami, 2012) had another attempt by syntactic analysis. There are also some implementations using neural networks (Razi and Eshqi, 2012).
