This book explores an approach to text understanding, in
particular anaphora resolution, that tries to limit the use of
detailed domain knowledge and commonsense inference by
exploiting general linguistic knowledge as much as possi-
ble. Carter proposes that, because natural language texts
are relatively redundant and are constructed considerately,
it should be possible in many cases to recover the interpre-
tation of the text by using either linguistic or nonlinguistic
techniques. Linguistic techniques are preferable because
they are more general and less open-ended. Carter&apos;s ap-
proach is called &amp;quot;shallow processing.&amp;quot; Since domain knowl-
edge and reasoning tend to be expensive to implement,
maintain, and use during processing, the shallow process-
ing approach should be much more efficient and portable
than an approach based heavily on domain-specific knowl-
edge. If it can at the same time provide reasonable accu-
racy, then it should be very useful. This seems to be a very
sensible approach in principle, and Carter demonstrates
that it is quite effective in practice.
The shallow processing hypothesis is tested in a program
called SPAR (Shallow Processing Anaphor Resolver),
which was implemented as part of the author&apos;s University
of Cambridge thesis. Shallow processing is presented as an
engineering solution to the problem of dealing with the use
of domain knowledge in text understanding, for certain
applications, not as a psychological hypothesis. In the
SPAR architecture, general linguistic techniques, such as
focusing, are used first. Domain reasoning is only used if
more than one candidate referent remains after the applica-
tion of linguistic knowledge. Although this approach is
tested specifically only for reference resolution, obviously it
could be extended to other areas of natural language
processing in which both linguistic and domain knowledge
could be used, such as reasoning.
The book presents an excellent and very clear review of
both current and older approaches to anaphora resolution,
as well as a clear description of the SPAR system. For this
reason, it would serve as a very good text for a seminar on
reference resolution as well as an extra reading for a class
on knowledge representation.
One attractive aspect of the SPAR system is that it
builds on previous work where appropriate, and extends it
where required. In particular, it integrates the work of
Boguraev (1979) in parsing, the work of Sidner (1979) in
focusing, and the work of Wilks (1975) in preference
semantics. Where Sidner&apos;s work, for example, is incom-
plete, as in the treatment of intrasentential anaphora,
Carter presents a reasonable extension to handle the addi-
tional phenomena. One minor oversight in this work is that,
in the treatment of one-anaphora, Carter fails to explore
recent pragmatically oriented approaches, such as those
discussed by Webber (1983) and Dahl (1984), who propose
unified treatments of definite pronouns and one-anaphora.
Instead, SPAR uses the older, and probably less effective,
syntactic approach suggested by Webber (1978) and Halli-
day and Hasan (1976).
Another commendable aspect of this work is that Carter
presents specific statistics on the accuracy of his system-
93% of pronominal anaphors (out of 242) and 82% of
nonpronominal anaphors (out of 80) are resolved correctly.
Although these statistics go beyond what is usually re-
ported, it would have been even more interesting to see a
detailed breakdown of anaphor types and accuracy. It
would also have been interesting to see statistics on the
efficiency of the system, since the overall algorithm is quite
complex. This high level of accuracy provides evidence that
shallow processing is a promising approach. However, these
statistics do raise the issue that we don&apos;t really know what
level of accuracy in anaphora resolution is &amp;quot;good enough.&amp;quot;
In fact, the &amp;quot;good enough&amp;quot; level of accuracy may vary by
application. Ninety-three percent may be accurate enough
for some applications, such as machine translation, or
message routing, but not for others, such as database
update. Perhaps the relatively inexpensive shallow process-
ing approach will turn out to be the method of choice for
applications with lower accuracy requirements. A related
issue that this work raises is how accurate we can expect to
getâ€”that is, how good is human performance on anaphora
resolution, and how close is Carter&apos;s system to that level?
These are questions that we simply don&apos;t know the answers
to, and that await future research, Carter has done a
valuable service in providing his statistics, but it is difficult
to interpret them without having these bases of comparison
and without having comparable statistics from other ap-
proaches.
In addition to supporting the shallow processing hypoth-
esis, this work also supports the usefulness (at least from an

engineering standpoint) of an architecture that provides a
clear separation of linguistic and nonlinguistic knowledge,
since it is hard to see how shallow processing could be
implemented without this separation.
Although SPAR is implemented as a complete natural
language system, it unfortunately still has something of a
&amp;quot;toy&amp;quot; flavor for two reasons. First of all, the data texts were
written specifically for this project, although not by people
who knew about SPAR. Although many of the phenomena
in these texts undoubtedly occur in more realistic texts, the
work would perhaps have been more convincing had Carter
used texts written for other purposes. Naturally occurring
texts often contain problematic constructions such as nomi-
nalizations, which present many interesting challenges for
semantics and anaphor resolution in natural language sys-
tems (Dahl et al. 1987), but which don&apos;t occur in Carter&apos;s
texts. The system also has a toy flavor because the end
application, paraphrase, is less obviously useful than many
other applications that might have been selected. There is
no reason to think that these problems affect the fundamen-
tal soundness of the work, but they do tend to make it less
interesting.
This work presents a very comprehensive implementa-
tion of the state of the art of reference resolution in natural
language processing. However, one is left at the end with a
frustrating sense that the whole process consists of exploit-
ing a set of more or less unrelated heuristics, which in fact
lead to very accurate reference resolution, but which don&apos;t
seem to fit together into a general picture of a unified
phenomenon. For example, Carter points out (using Sid-
ner&apos;s terminology) that the discourse focus is preferred to
intra-sentential candidates, but that intra-sentential candi-
dates are preferred to potential discourse foci. It is only
natural to wonder why these preferences (and others)
should be the way they are, and whether they can be
expected to fall out from more general principles. This is
not specifically a criticism of Carter, but points out an
unsatisfying aspect of much computational work in ana-
phora resolution. It is in fact at least partially the result of
the clarity of his presentation that this issue emerges.
I found this book very stimulating, interesting, and clear.
I would recommend it to anyone interested in reference
resolution or computational pragmatics in general.

Church argues against the so-called &amp;quot;standard position&amp;quot; in
speech recognition, i.e. the use of syntacticâ€”semantic knowl-
edge to disambiguate uncertain sounds in utterances. The
argument proceeds by showing first that allophonic varia-
tion in speech is a source of useful information and not an
obstacle for speech recognition. The claim sounds reason-
able, but is not trivial because much of the work in the past
was based on an opposite view. A part of this claim is that
allophonic cues often indicate the location of boundaries
(Nakatani&apos;s position).
Another important issue in the book is that syllable
structure is very useful as a framework for describing
allophonic variation. This is also a very reasonable claim
from the linguistic point of view, but it is something that
many of the leading current phonological theories fail to
achieve.
The author assumes a constituency hypothesis where
many allophonic and phonological processes share the same
environments (e.g. foot-initial, foot-internal). This is done
in a phrase-structure and chart-parsing framework. The

Where Sidner&apos;s work, for example, is incomplete, as in the treatment of intrasentential anaphora, Carter presents a reasonable extension to handle the additional phenomena. One minor oversight in this work is that, in the treatment of one-anaphora, Carter fails to explore recent pragmatically oriented approaches, such as those discussed by Webber (1983) and Dahl (1984), who propose unified treatments of definite pronouns and one-anaphora. Instead, SPAR uses the older, and probably less effective, syntactic approach suggested by Webber (1978) and Halliday and Hasan (1976). Another commendable aspect of this work is that Carter presents specific statistics on the accuracy of his system93% of pronominal anaphors (out of 242) and 82% of nonpronominal anaphors (out of 80) are resolved correctly. Although these statistics go beyond what is usually reported, it would have been even more interesting to see a detailed breakdown of anaphor types and accuracy. It would also have been interesting to see statistics on the efficiency of the system, since the overall algorithm is quite complex. This high level of accuracy provides evidence that</context>

The book presents an excellent and very clear review of both current and older approaches to anaphora resolution, as well as a clear description of the SPAR system. For this reason, it would serve as a very good text for a seminar on reference resolution as well as an extra reading for a class on knowledge representation. One attractive aspect of the SPAR system is that it builds on previous work where appropriate, and extends it where required. In particular, it integrates the work of Boguraev (1979) in parsing, the work of Sidner (1979) in focusing, and the work of Wilks (1975) in preference semantics.
