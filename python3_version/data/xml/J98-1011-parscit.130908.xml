While respecting its historical link with the field of MT, Machine Translation is
changing and broadening its scope of interest to encompass all branches of
Computational Linguistics and Language Engineering, whereverthey incorporate
a MULTILINGUAL aspect. We thereforewelcome submissions to the journal on
THEORETICAL, DESCRIPTIVE OR COMPUTATIONAL ASPECTS of any of
the following topics:
- machine translation and machine-aided translation
- human translation theory and practise multilingual text composition and
generation
- multilingual information retrieval

- multilingual natural language interfaces
- multilingual dialogue systems
- multilingual message understanding systems i
- corpus-based and statistical language modelling
- connectionist approaches to translation compilation and use of bi- and
multilingual corpora
- discourse phenomena and their treatment in (human or machine) translation *
- knowledge engineering W
- contrastive linguistics CI)
- morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics 13
- computer-aided language instruction and learning
- software localization and internationalization =
- speech processing, especially for speech translation
- phonetics, phonology
- computational implications of non-Roman character sets
- multilingual word-processing
- the multilingual information society (sociological and legal as well as linguistic
aspects)
- minority languages
- history of machine translation.
We would also welcome your suggestions about other features you would like K I u we r

This is the official publication of the European Association =
for Logic, Language, and Information. The scope of the
journal is the logical and computational foundations of -C,
natural, formal, and programming languages, as well as ...,
the different forms of human and mechanized inference. It .....,
covers the logical, linguistic, and information-theoretic parts *
of the cognitive sciences. Examples of main subareas are
Intensional Logics including Dynamic Logic; Nonmonotonic *
Logic and Belief Revision; Constructive Logics; Complexity *
Issues in Logic and Linguistics; Theoretical Problems of
Logic Programming and Resolution; Categorial Grammar *
and Type Theory; Generalized Quantification; Information- X
Oriented Theories of Semantic Structure like Situation -0
Semantics, Discourse Representation Theory, and Dynamic .
Semantics; Connectionist Models of Logical and Linguistic =
Structures. The emphasis is on the theoretical aspects of
these areas. The purpose of the journal is to act as a forum
for researchers interested in the theoretical foundations of
the above subjects and their interdisciplinary connections,
with an emphasis on general ideas increasing coherence.

Guidelines for Submissions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.8766372">
Manuscripts for Computational Linguistics should be submitted on letter-size paper (8.5 by
11 inches, or A4), double-spaced and single-sided throughout, including footnotes and refer-
ences. The paper should begin with an informative abstract of approximately 150-250 words.
Manuscripts must be written in English. Contact the editor regarding the possibility of electronic
submission.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.963334">
Submissions may be made in any of the following categories: ,
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993355529411765">
Papers: This category includes contributions that report significant new research results in com-
putational linguistics or that provide critical reviews of the literature on a particular topic. The
length of a paper depends on its content, but it is suggested that manuscripts be limited to
forty double-spaced, pages. That is the equivalent of thirty journal pages. Each paper is fully
refereed by three or four experts in the field. Manuscripts may also be submitted electronically;
consult http:/ /www.cs.columbia.edu/—radev/acl/subrnit.txt for instructions and pointers to
the LATEX style files. The submission of ah article to CL for refereeing means that the author
certifies the manuscript is not Copyrighted; nor has it been published or submitted for publica-
tion to another refereed journal. If any version of the paper has appeared, or will appear, in a
non-refereed publication, the details of such publication must be made known to the Editor at
the time of submission. The final version of a paper tentatively accepted for publication must
be accompanied by a Copyright Transfer Agreement signed by all of the authors or, in the
case of a &amp;quot;work for hire,&amp;quot; by the employer. This written transfer is necessary under the 1978
U.S. Copyright law.
Letters to the Editor: This category includes statements of opinion on- issues relevant to the
readership. The Editor and the editorial board will evaluate the appropriateness of these con-
tributions for inclusion.

Squibs and Discussions: This category includes short articles reporting technical results, dis-
cussions of results, algorithms, or new computational linguistic data or tools of interest to the
journal readership. Submission format is the same as for regular papers, but the length should
in no case exceed eight journal pages. Electronic submissions (LATEX source, postscript or plain

Founded in 1962, the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) is the primary scientific and
professional society for natural language processing research and applications. A European chapter was
established in 1982. Besides publishing Computational Linguistics, the ACL holds international meetings
(annually in North America, biennially in Europe) where the state-of-the-art in natural language
processing research and development is presented. Recently, special interest groups on the Mathematics of
Language, the Lexicon, Parsing, Generation, Computational Phonology, Multimedia Language Processing,
and Very Large Corpora have been formed; others are likely to be added.

Submissions may be made in any of the following categories: , category includes contributions that report significant new research results in computational linguistics or that provide critical reviews of the literature on a particular topic. The length of a paper depends on its content, but it is suggested that manuscripts be limited to forty double-spaced, pages. That is the equivalent of thirty journal pages. Each paper is fully refereed by three or four experts in the field. Manuscripts may also be submitted electronically; consult http:/ /www.cs.columbia.edu/—radev/acl/subrnit.txt for instructions and pointers to LATEX style files. The submission of ah article to CL for refereeing means author certifies the manuscript is not Copyrighted; nor has it been published or submitted for publication to another refereed journal. If any version of the paper has appeared, or will appear, in a non-refereed publication, the details of such publication must be made known to the Editor at the time of submission. The final version of a paper tentatively accepted for publication must be accompanied by a Copyright Transfer Agreement signed by all of the authors or, in the case of a &amp;quot;work for hire,&amp;quot; by the employer.

<abstract confidence="0.893797571428571">Founded in 1962, the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) is the primary scientific and professional society for natural language processing research and applications. A European chapter was in 1982. Besides publishing Linguistics, ACL holds international meetings (annually in North America, biennially in Europe) where the state-of-the-art in natural language processing research and development is presented. Recently, special interest groups on the Mathematics of Language, the Lexicon, Parsing, Generation, Computational Phonology, Multimedia Language Processing, and Very Large Corpora have been formed; others are likely to be added.</abstract>
