In the last 15 years of computational linguistic research, a lot of work has focused on
the investigation of the reusability of lexical resources (machine-readable dictionaries
and corpora) because it has been realized that the development of large-scale NLP
systems heavily depends on a huge and powerful lexicon.
Turning a Bilingual Dictionary into a Lexical-Semantic Database, based on the Ph.D. the-
sis of Thierry Fontenelle (University of Liege), is a new attempt to reuse an existing
machine-readable bilingual dictionary, the Collins-Robert English-French dictionary
(CR), this time to construct a huge lexical-semantic database (70,000 pairs of collocates).
It describes in detail what work was necessary to make such a lexical resource proces-
sible for further (manual) enrichment and at last accessible for various applications.
The reader learns something about the &amp;quot;technical&amp;quot; conversion of the typesetting
tape into a flexible relational database (dBaseIII+) and some of the problems with
the typographic inconsistencies of a printed dictionary that could not be resolved
completely automatically (Chapter 6). At this stage of the work it is already apparent
how useful such a database could be, providing access to the dictionary through
different starting points, not only by the headword. Now it is possible to generate
a monofunctional view of a multifunctional dictionary (designed for encoding and
decoding), as was shown in the COMPASS project (Feldweg and Breidt 1996).
The main emphasis is on the lexicographical work that was required for the sys-
tematic enrichment of the database with lexical-semantic information. Pairs of collo-
cates are related to each other syntagmatically and paradigmatically. Fontenelle prefers
the descriptive power of Meraik&apos;s (1988) lexical functions to Pustejovsky&apos;s (1995)
qualia structure, since it is not clear how the latter can be adapted to modeling verbs.
Fontenelle does not withhold the disadvantages of Mel&apos;aik&apos;s lexical functions (LFs)
from the reader. For one thing, because of the limited number of LFs, he suggests a
few additional ones (Chapter 8). For example, he proposes the PART function, which
defines a part-whole relationship and which relates to world knowledge and is there-
fore not covered by Mel&apos;C&apos;uk&apos;s purely lexical Meaning&lt;=&gt;Text Theory, but is very useful
in an information retrieval context. Also, the assignment of lexical functions to a given
pair of collocates was done manually, to avoid inconsistencies. Only a small number
of lexical functions could have been detected automatically by the analysis of defining
formulas (Chapter 7). The lexicographer uses a menu-driven interface to the database

and chooses among a predetermined part-of-speech-dependent list of possible LFs.
This does not solve the problem of ambiguous lexical functions, due to the sometimes
vague definitions. Fontenelle provides some linguistic tests and morphological clues
(Chapter 9), but they cover only a few cases. This is clearly a deficiency (of which
the author is aware), but it is unsurprising, given the magnitude of the task. This is
the first attempt to apply such a theory to a really huge amount of general-language
bilingual data and it shows the descriptive power of lexical functions. To give a bet-
ter impression of the conversion process, here are the CR entries and the respective
representation with the lexical function SING (single unit) from page 115:
mouthful n (food] bouchee
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.54558925">
gulp 1 n (b) (mouthful) (food] bouchee, goulee
portion n (. .) (of food: helping) portion
ration n (allowance: of food, goods etc) ration
Sing(food) = gulp, mouthful, morsel, portion, ration...
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999904090909091">
As applications of the database, Fontenelle mentions its potential value as a testbed
for linguistic theories, e.g., to extract linking information about ergative verbs (Chap-
ter 12), and its possible use in a computer-aided language learning system to teach
collocations to language learners (Chapter 14). Astonishingly, he does not say very
much about the usability of the database for large-scale NLP systems, perhaps be-
cause the data has to be exported to the representation formalism used by the NLP
system and because there is no lexical inheritance incorporated in the database. But in
his general conclusions (Chapter 15), Fontenelle writes about attempts to link the CR
database to WordNet (Fellbaum 1998), the huge English electronic thesaurus; together
with the inheritance mechanisms of WordNet, the database could be very useful to
information retrieval systems, for instance.
In summary, the book is very well worth reading for someone who is interested in
recent advances in lexical semantics or in the more application-oriented area of compu-
tational lexicography. Perhaps Fontenelle&apos;s work may be a further step towards bridg-
ing the gap between linguists and lexicographers. The structure of the book is well
thought-out and gives the reader the possibility of choosing between the more theoret-
ical parts, with a good introduction to Pustejovsky&apos;s Generative Lexicon and Men&apos;ules
Meaning&lt;=Text Theory, and the possible applications of the bilingual database. Each
chapter closes with a short conclusion section very useful to get the main points and
to prevent the reader from losing the thread. At any rate, with the construction of this
database, Fontenelle and his colleagues have provided a valuable bilingual lexicon
that could contribute greatly to the performance of an NLP system.
