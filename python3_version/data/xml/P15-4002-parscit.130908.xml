Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999827423076923">
Semantic annotated parallel corpora,
though rare, play an increasingly impor-
tant role in natural language processing.
These corpora provide valuable data for
computational tasks like sense-based
machine translation and word sense
disambiguation, but also to contrastive
linguistics and translation studies. In
this paper we present the ongoing devel-
opment of a web-based corpus semantic
annotation environment that uses the Open
Multilingual Wordnet (Bond and Foster,
2013) as a sense inventory. The system
includes interfaces to help coordinating
the annotation project and a corpus brows-
ing interface designed specifically to meet
the needs of a semantically annotated
corpus. The tool was designed to build
the NTU-Multilingual Corpus (Tan and
Bond, 2012). For the past six years, our
tools have been tested and developed in
parallel with the semantic annotation of a
portion of this corpus in Chinese, English,
Japanese and Indonesian. The annotation
system is released under an open source
license (MIT).

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999966">
Plain text parallel corpora are relatively widely
available and widely used in NLP, such as machine
translation system development (Koehn, 2005,
e.g., ). In contrast, there are very few parallel sense
tagged corpora due to the expense of tagging the
corpora and creating the sense inventories in mul-
tiple languages. The one exception is the trans-
lations of English SemCor (Landes et al., 1998)
for Italian (Bentivogli and Pianta, 2005), Roma-
nian (Lupu et al., 2005) and Japanese (Bond et al.,
2012). Even for this corpus, not all of the origi-
nal English texts have been translated and tagged,
and not all words are tagged in the translated text
(typically only those with a corresponding English
sense).
In this paper we present IMI, a web-based mul-
tilingual semantic annotation system designed for
the task of sense annotation. The main goals of
its design were to decrease the cost of production
of these resources by optimizing the speed of tag-
ging, and to facilitate the management of this kind
of project. To accomplish this, we aimed at devel-
oping a simple and intuitive web-based system that
allows parallel tagging by many users at a time,
optimized for speed by requiring minimum input
from the annotators.
We centered our development around the an-
notation of the NTU-Multilingual Corpus (NTU-
MC: Tan and Bond, 2012). The NTU-MC is
an open multilingual parallel corpus originally de-
signed to include many layers of syntactic and se-
mantic annotation. We selected a portion of this
corpus based on 7,093 sentences of English, total-
ing 22,762 sentences of Chinese, Japanese and In-
donesian parallel text. A series of undergraduate
linguistics students were trained on the tool and
annotated the corpus over several years. They also
offered extensive qualitative and quantitative feed-
back on the usage of our system.
The remainder of this paper is arranged as fol-
lows. In Section 2 we introduce related work. Sec-
tion 3 describes the main functionality of our sys-
tem then we finish with Section 4, which summa-
rizes and discusses our current and future work.

2.1 The NTU-Multilingual Corpus
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.983744086956522">
(NTU-MC)
The NTU-MC (Tan and Bond, 2012) has data
available for eight languages from seven language
families (Arabic, Chinese, English, Indonesian,
Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese and Thai), dis-
tributed across four domains (story, essay, news,
and tourism). The corpus started off with mono-
lingual part-of-speech (POS) annotation and cross-
lingual linking of sentences. We are extending it
to include monolingual sense annotation and cross-
lingual word and concept alignments (Bond et al.,
2013). Out of the available languages, Chinese,
English, Japanese and Indonesian were chosen for
further processing and annotation (due to the avail-
ability of lexical and human resources). As part
of the annotation, we are also expanding the sense
and concept inventory of the wordnets: Princeton
Wordnet (PWN: Fellbaum, 1998), the Japanese
Wordnet (Isahara et al., 2008), the Chinese Open
Wordnet (Wang and Bond, 2013) and the Word-
net Bahasa (Nurril Hirfana et al. 2011) through
the Open Multingual Wordnet (Bond and Foster,
2013).

2.2 The Open Multilingual Wordnet
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999902227272727">
The task of semantic annotating a corpus involves
the manual (and often automated) disambiguation
of words using lexical semantic resources – select-
ing, for each word, the best match in a pool of
available concepts. Among this type of resources,
the PWN has, perhaps, attained the greatest visibil-
ity. As a resource, a wordnet is simply a huge net
of concepts, senses and definitions linked through
many different types of relations. Because of pop-
ularity and confirmed utility, many projects have
developed wordnets for different languages.
The Open Multilingual Wordent (OMW) (Bond
and Foster, 2013) is an open source multilin-
gual resource that combines many individual open-
source wordnet projects, along with data extracted
from Wiktionary and the Unicode Common Locale
Data Repository. It contains over 2 million senses
distributed over more than 150 languages, linked
through PWN. Browsing can be done monolin-
gual or multilingually, and it incorporates a full-
fledged wordnet editing system which our system
uses (OMWEdit: da Costa and Bond, 2015).

2.3 Other Available Systems
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999983333333333">
There are many text annotation tools available for
research (e.g., Stenetorp et al., 2012). However,
sense annotation has some features that differ from
most common annotation tasks (such as NE or POS
annotation). In particular, the number of tags, and
the information associated with each tag is very
large. Sense tagging for English using the PWN,
for example, when unrestricted, defaults at over
a hundred thousand possible tags to chose from:
even constrained by the lemma, there may be over
40 tags and the set of tags will very from lemma to
lemma.
There are only a few annotation tools designed
specifically for sense annotation. We were able
to find the following: the tools to tag the Hinoki
Corpus (Bond et al., 2008), for Japanese, and the
Sense Annotation Tool for the American National
Corpus (SATANiC: Passonneau et al., 2009), for
English. Both of these tools were developed to be
used in a monolingual environment, and have not
been released.
The only open source tool that we could find was
Chooser (Koeva et al., 2008), a multi-task annota-
tion tool that was used to tag the Bulgarian Sense
Tagged Corpus (Koeva et al., 2006). This tool is
open source, language independent and is capable
of integrating a wordnet as a sense inventory. Un-
fortunately, it was not designed to be a web-service
which means it is difficult to coordinate the work
of multiple users.

<bodyText confidence="0.998874333333333">
Given the scenario of available systems, we de-
cided we had enough motivation to start the de-
velopment of a new Semantic Annotation Environ-
ment (IMI).
Because a large part of sense-tagging is adding
new senses to the inventory, we integrated IMI with
the existing tools for editing and displaying the
Open Multilingual Wordnet. This integration was
done mainly through the development of a sin-
gle web-based environment, with a common login,
and API communications between interfaces. We
also designed a custom mode to display OMW re-
sults in a condensed way.Sharing a common login
system allows our annotators to access the OMW
wordnet editing mode (right hand of Figure 1) so
that, when needed, annotators can add new senses
and concepts to fit the data in the corpus.
Our system is written in Python and uses SQLite

3.1 The Annotation Interfaces
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999879458333333">
The sequential/textual tagger (Figure 1) was de-
signed for concept-by-concept sequential tagging.
It shows a short context around the sentence cur-
rently being tagged. Clicking a word generates an
automated query in the OMW frame (on the right
of Figure 1).
As it is costly to remember the set of senses for
each word, we normally tag with a lexical/targeted
tagger (Figure 2 displays only the left side of this
tagging interface, as the OMW frame is identical
to that of Figure 1). Querying the OMW with this
tagger is very similar to the description above. The
main difference of this interface is that it focuses
on a single lexical unit across the corpus. In the
example provided in Figure 2, every occurrence of
the lemma wire is tagged at the same time. For fre-
quent words, the number of results displayed can
be restricted. In this interface, only the sentence
where the word occurs is provided as context, but
a larger context can also be accessed by clicking
on the sentence ID. Since the concept inventory
is the same for the full list of words to be tagged,
time is saved by keeping the concepts fresh in the
annotator’s mind, and quality is ensured by com-

paring different usages of different senses at the

<figureCaption confidence="0.99338">
Figure 2: Targeted/Lexical Tagger

<bodyText confidence="0.9998492">
In both tagging interfaces, a tag is selected
among an array of radio buttons displayed next to
the words being tagged. Besides the numerical op-
tions that match the results retrieved by the OMW,
the interface also allows tagging with a set of meta
tags for named entities and to flag other issues. We
use a similar set to that of Bond et al. (2013). With
every tag, a comment field is provided as an op-
tional field, where annotators can leave notes or
describe errors.

<bodyText confidence="0.999964107142857">
Missing senses are one of the major problems
during the semantic annotation. We overcome this
by integrating the wordnet editing interface pro-
vided by the OMW. Depending on the annotation
task at hands, the annotation of a corpus can be
done in parallel with the expansion of the respec-
tive wordnet’s concept and sense inventory.
A third tagging interface (not shown) allows
also the direct manipulation of the corpus struc-
ture. Its major features include creating, deleting
and editing sentences, words and concepts. It is
too generalized to be used as an efficient tagger,
but it is useful to correct POS tags, tokenization er-
rors and occasional spelling mistakes. It can also
be used to correct or create complex concept struc-
tures of multi-word expressions, that could not be
automatically identified.
The minimal input required by our interfaces (in
the typical case, just clicking a radio button), espe-
cially the lexical tagger, ensures time isn’t wasted
with complex interfaces. It also guarantees that
through the automated linking of the databases,
we avoid typos and similar noise in the produced
data. An earlier version allowed annotators to tag
directly with synset IDs, but it turned out that it
was very common for the ID to be mangled in
some way, so we now only allow entering a synset
through the linking to the OMW.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999383">
3.2 Annotation Agreement
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99997879245283">
IMI also includes a tool to measure inter-annotator
agreement (Figure 3). Up to four annotations can
be compared, for any section of the corpus. The
tool also calculates the majority tag (MajTag). Av-
erage agreements scores are then computed be-
tween annotators and between annotators and the
majority tag. Results are displayed by sentence and
for the selected portion (e.g. the entire corpus).
Agreement with the MajTag is color coded for
each annotation so that the annotators can quickly
spot disagreements. The interface provides quick
access to database editing for all taggers, and to the
OMW editing tools. The elected MajTag can also
be automatically propagated as the final tag for ev-
ery instance.
For some texts up to three annotators have been
used, with one being a research assistant and two
being students in a semantics class. These students
only had a half hour of training, and used the se-
quential tagger to tag around 250 concepts each.
The average inter-annotator agreement was 67.5%.
Tagging speed was around 60 concepts/hour (self
reported time). Note that roughly 25% of the po-
tential concepts were pre-marked as x: entries such
as preposition in, which should only be tagged on
the very rare cases it is an adjective (This is very in
this year or noun (I live in Lafayette, IN). Because
the students were minimally trained (and not all
highly motivated) we expected a low agreement. If
two out of three annotators agreed then the words
were tagged with the majority tag. Where all three
annotators disagreed the students were required to
discuss and re-tag those entries, and submit a re-
port on them. An expert (the first author) then
read (and marked) all the reports and fixed any tags
where he disagreed with their proposed solution.
Adjudicating and marking the reports takes about
30 minutes each, with some difficult to fix prob-
lems left for later. As a result of this process, all
words have been seen by multiple annotators, and
all hard ones by an expert (and our students have
a much better understanding of the issues in repre-
senting word meaning using a fixed sense inven-
tory)
For most texts, we only have enough funding to
pay for a single annotator. Targetted tagging (an-
notating by word type) is known to be more accu-
rate (Langone et al., 2004; Bond et al., 2008) and
we use this for the single annotator. We expect
to catch errors when we compare the annotations
across languages: the annotation of the translation
can serve as another annotator (although of course
not all concepts match across languages).

3.3 Journaling
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999980333333333">
We take advantage of the relational database and
use SQL triggers to keep track of every committed
change, time-stamping and recording the annota-
tor on every commit (true for both scripted and hu-
man manipulated data). The system requires going
through a login system before granting access to
the tools, hence permitting a detailed yet automatic
journaling system. A detailed and tractable history
of the annotation is available to control both the
work-flow and check the quality of annotation. We
can export the data into a variety of formats, such
as RDF compatible XML and plain text triples.

Mousing over a word shows its lemma, pos, sense
and annotators’ comments (if any), clicking on a
word pops up more information about the lemma,
pos and sense (such as definitions) that can be
clicked for even more information. Further, it
is possible to see aligned sentences (for as many
languages as selected), and color coded sentiment
scores using two freely available sentiment lexi-
cons, the SentiWordNet (Baccianella et al., 2010)
and the ML-SentiCon (Cruz et al., 2014) (individ-
ually or intersected). Further improvements will
allow highlighting cross-lingual word and concept
alignments (inspired by Nara: Song and Bond,

<bodyText confidence="0.9998524">
We have described the main interfaces and func-
tionality of IMI. It has undergone almost six years
of development, and is now a mature annotation
platform. The improvement of its interfaces and
functionality have not only greatly boosted the
speed of the NTU-MC annotation, but has also
greatly facilitated its coordination - making it eas-
ier to maintain both consistency and quality of the
corpus.
In the near future we intend to:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.995173307692308">
• refine the cross-lingual word and concept
alignment tool (not shown here)
• develop a reporting interface, where the
project coordinators can easily review the
history of changes committed to the corpus
database
• add a simple corpus import tool for adding
new texts in different languages
• further develop the corpus search interface,
to allow highlighting cross-lingual word and
concept links
• implement more automated consistency
checks (e.g. match lemmas of words with

the lemmas of concepts, verify that concept
lemmas are still senses of the concept used to
tag a word, etc.)
• improve graphical coherence, as different
parts of the toolkit have originally been devel-
oped separately, as a whole, our system cur-
rently lacks graphical coherence
We hope that the open release of our system can
motivate other projects to embrace semantic anno-
tation projects, especially projects that are less ori-
ented towards development of systems. We would
like every wordnet to be accompanied by a sense-
tagged corpus!

These corpora provide valuable data for computational tasks like sense-based machine translation and word sense disambiguation, but also to contrastive linguistics and translation studies. In this paper we present the ongoing development of a web-based corpus semantic annotation environment that uses the Open Multilingual Wordnet (Bond and Foster, 2013) as a sense inventory. The system includes interfaces to help coordinating the annotation project and a corpus browsing interface designed specifically to meet the needs of a semantically annotated corpus. The tool was designed to build the NTU-Multilingual Corpus (Tan and Bond, 2012). For the past six years, our tools have been tested and developed in parallel with the semantic annotation of a portion of this corpus in Chinese, English, Japanese and Indonesian. The annotation system is released under an open source license (MIT). 1 Introduction Plain text parallel corpora are relatively widel</context>

As part of the annotation, we are also expanding the sense and concept inventory of the wordnets: Princeton Wordnet (PWN: Fellbaum, 1998), the Japanese Wordnet (Isahara et al., 2008), the Chinese Open Wordnet (Wang and Bond, 2013) and the Wordnet Bahasa (Nurril Hirfana et al. 2011) through the Open Multingual Wordnet (Bond and Foster, 2013). 2.2 The Open Multilingual Wordnet The task of semantic annotating a corpus involves the manual (and often automated) disambiguation of words using lexical semantic resources – selecting, for each word, the best match in a pool of available concepts. Among this type of resources, the PWN has, perhaps, attained the greatest visibility. As a resource, a wordnet is simply a huge net of concepts, senses and definitions linked through many different types of relations.

In particular, the number of tags, and the information associated with each tag is very large. Sense tagging for English using the PWN, for example, when unrestricted, defaults at over a hundred thousand possible tags to chose from: even constrained by the lemma, there may be over 40 tags and the set of tags will very from lemma to lemma. There are only a few annotation tools designed specifically for sense annotation. We were able to find the following: the tools to tag the Hinoki Corpus (Bond et al., 2008), for Japanese, and the Sense Annotation Tool for the American National Corpus (SATANiC: Passonneau et al., 2009), for English. Both of these tools were developed to be used in a monolingual environment, and have not been released. The only open source tool that we could find was Chooser (Koeva et al., 2008), a multi-task annotation tool that was used to tag the Bulgarian Sense Tagged Corpus (Koeva et al., 2006). This tool is open source, language independent and is capable of integrating a wordnet as a sense inventory. Unfortunately, it was not designed to be a web-service which means it is d</context>

Adjudicating and marking the reports takes about 30 minutes each, with some difficult to fix problems left for later. As a result of this process, all words have been seen by multiple annotators, and all hard ones by an expert (and our students have a much better understanding of the issues in representing word meaning using a fixed sense inventory) For most texts, we only have enough funding to pay for a single annotator. Targetted tagging (annotating by word type) is known to be more accurate (Langone et al., 2004; Bond et al., 2008) and we use this for the single annotator. We expect to catch errors when we compare the annotations across languages: the annotation of the translation can serve as another annotator (although of course not all concepts match across languages). 3.3 Journaling We take advantage of the relational database and use SQL triggers to keep track of every committed change, time-stamping and recording the annotator on every commit (true for both scripted and human manipulated data).

The corpus started off with monolingual part-of-speech (POS) annotation and crosslingual linking of sentences. We are extending it to include monolingual sense annotation and crosslingual word and concept alignments (Bond et al., 2013).

Figure 2: Targeted/Lexical Tagger In both tagging interfaces, a tag is selected among an array of radio buttons displayed next to the words being tagged. Besides the numerical options that match the results retrieved by the OMW, the interface also allows tagging with a set of meta tags for named entities and to flag other issues. We use a similar set to that of Bond et al. (2013). With every tag, a comment field is provided as an optional field, where annotators can leave notes or describe errors. 9 Missing senses are one of the major problems during the semantic annotation. We overcome this by integrating the wordnet editing interface provided by the OMW. Depending on the annotation task at hands, the annotation of a corpus can be done in parallel with the expansion of the respective wordnet’s concept and sense inventory. A third tagging interface (not shown) allows also the direct manipulation of the corpus structure. Its major features include creating, deleting an</context>

Adjudicating and marking the reports takes about 30 minutes each, with some difficult to fix problems left for later. As a result of this process, all words have been seen by multiple annotators, and all hard ones by an expert (and our students have a much better understanding of the issues in representing word meaning using a fixed sense inventory) For most texts, we only have enough funding to pay for a single annotator. Targetted tagging (annotating by word type) is known to be more accurate (Langone et al., 2004; Bond et al., 2008) and we use this for the single annotator. We expect to catch errors when we compare the annotations across languages: the annotation of the translation can serve as another annotator (although of course not all concepts match across languages). 3.3 Journaling We take advantage of the relational database and use SQL triggers to keep track of every committed change, time-stamping and recording the annotator on every commit (true for both scripted and human manipulated data).

There are only a few annotation tools designed specifically for sense annotation.

Both of these tools were developed to be used in a monolingual environment, and have not been released. The only open source tool that we could find was Chooser (Koeva et al., 2008), a multi-task annotation tool that was used to tag the Bulgarian Sense Tagged Corpus (Koeva et al., 2006). This tool is open source, language independent and is capable of integrating a wordnet as a sense inventory. Unfortunately, it was not designed to be a web-service which means it is difficult to coordinate the work of multiple users. 3 System Overview and Architecture Given the scenario of avail</context>

Further improvements will allow highlighting cross-lingual word and concept alignments (inspired by Nara: Song and Bond, 2009). 4 Summary and Future Work We have described the main interfaces and functionality of IMI. It has undergone almost six years of development, and is now a mature annotation platform. The improvement of its interfaces and functionality have not only greatly boosted the speed of the NTU-MC annotation, but has also greatly facilitated its coordination - making it easier to maintain both consistency and quality of the corpus. In the near future we intend to: • refine the cross-lingual word and concept alignment tool (not shown here) • develop a reporting interface, where the project coordinators c</context>

The system includes interfaces to help coordinating the annotation project and a corpus browsing interface designed specifically to meet the needs of a semantically annotated corpus.

The main goals of its design were to decrease the cost of production of these resources by optimizing the speed of tagging, and to facilitate the management of this kind of project. To accomplish this, we aimed at developing a simple and intuitive web-based system that allows parallel tagging by many users at a time, optimized for speed by requiring minimum input from the annotators. We centered our development around the annotation of the NTU-Multilingual Corpus (NTUMC: Tan and Bond, 2012). The NTU-MC is an open multilingual parallel corpus originally designed to include many layers of syntactic and semantic annotation. We selected a portion of this corpus based on 7,093 sentences of English, totaling 22,762 sentences of Chinese, Japanese and Indonesian parallel text. A series of undergraduate linguistics students were trained on the tool and annotated the corpus over several years. They also offered extensive qualitative and quantitative feedback on the usage of our system. The remainder of this paper is arranged as follows. In Section 2 we introduce related work.

Out of the available languages, Chinese, English, Japanese and Indonesian were chosen for further processing and annotation (due to the availability of lexical and human resources). As part of the annotation, we are also expanding the sense and concept inventory of the wordnets: Princeton Wordnet (PWN: Fellbaum, 1998), the Japanese Wordnet (Isahara et al., 2008), the Chinese Open Wordnet (Wang and Bond, 2013) and the Wordnet Bahasa (Nurril Hirfana et al. 2011) through the Open Multingual Wordnet (Bond and Foster, 2013). 2.2 The Open Multilingual Wordnet The task of semantic annotating a corpus involves the manual (and often automated) disambiguation of words using lexical semantic resources – selecting, for each word, the best match in a pool of available concepts. Among this type of resources, the PWN has, perhaps, attained the greatest visibility. As a resource, a wordnet is simply a huge net of concepts, senses and definitions linked through many different types of relations. Because of popular</context>
