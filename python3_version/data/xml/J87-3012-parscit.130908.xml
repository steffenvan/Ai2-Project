cloud the boundaries between the areas mentioned
above even more than usual.
Historically, the current upsurge of interest in com-
putational linguistics is, then, partly associated with the
factor of rising general interest in concrete applications
of computers, particularly microcomputers, with the
idea that experience in language-oriented computer
applications may be a useful kind of qualification for
language and linguistics graduates in an age when
traditional occupations such as state school language
teaching are on the decline.
Another pragmatic factor is the current demand for
research and development in natural language oriented
branches of Al, in particular for German natural lan-
guage access systems for databases and expert systems
and in the context of machine translation, activities
which have been increasing in importance over the past
ten years in German universities, industry and in fund-
ing policy.
A factor which has perhaps contributed less to cur-
rent interest than it has elsewhere is theoretical linguis-
tics, with an interest in computational properties of
natural languages, and in developments and controver-
sies which have motivated the development of compu-
tational tools for the development and testing of linguis-
tic descriptions. During the past decade, linguistics in
Germany has been strongly descriptive, with emphasis
on empirical and interpretative research in fields such as
sociolinguistics, discourse analysis, and language acqui-
sition, with less emphasis on the formal properties of
language structures and processes. The inauguration of
the &amp;quot;Sektion Computerlinguistik&amp;quot; in the DGfS has
re-affirmed the importance of such issues, however.
A more detailed understanding of current interests
may be gleaned from the SiC Summer School pro-
gramme. Five types of events were offered: thematic
courses, intensive practical programming courses in
LISP and PROLOG (elementary and advanced), a lec-
ture cycle by course teachers, invited and guest lec-
tures, and panel discussions. Munich in September also
offered a limitless range of additional activities, of
course.
The courses were held by Hans Altmann and Joa-
chim Jacobs (Munich), Rainer Baeuerle (Tuebingen),
Robin Cooper (Madison &amp; Edinburgh), Konrad Ehlich
(Dortmund) and Jochen Rehbein (Hamburg), Hans-
Juergen Eikmeyer (Bielefeld), Elisabet Engdahl (Mad-
ison &amp; Lund), Guenter Goerz (Erlangen), Helmar Gust
(Osnabrueck), Christopher Habel (Hamburg), Hans
Haugeneder and Manfred Gehrke (Siemens, Munich),
Roland Hauser (Munich), Wolfgang Hoeppner (Ham-
burg, Koblenz), Werner Kasllmeyer (Mannheim), Mar-
tin Kay (Xerox Palo Alto), James Kilbury (Trier),
Juergen Krause (Regensburg), Wolfgang Kreitmair
(Tuebingen), Michael Keoenig (Berlin), Sebastian
Loebner (Dusseldorf), Katharina Monk (Berlin), Peter
Sells (CSLI Stanford), Hans Guenther Tillman &amp; Lies-
lotte Schiefer (Munich), Hans Uszkoreit (IBM Stuttgart
and Stanford), Dietmar Zaefferer (Munich), and Annie
Zaenen (CSLI Stanford).
There was a wide range of topics, from more specif-
ically descriptive and theoretical linguistics topics like
&amp;quot;Syntax and Intonation,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Quantification,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Ana-
phora,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Discourse Analysis&amp;quot; to contemporary
linguistic theories (in particular GPSG, LFG, GB) and
computational linguistic questions of parsing, unifica-
tion, simulation, linguistic formalisms, with linguisti-
cally relevant Al topics such as knowledge representa-
tion or question-answer systems, and finally signal
processing in experimental phonetics.
In addition to lectures by SiC course teachers, in-
vited lectures were given on computational linguistic
and Al NL topics by Lauri Karttunen (Stanford), Henk
Zeevat (Edinburgh), Jun-Ichi Tsujii (Kyoto), Petr Sgall
(Prague), Egbert Lehmann (Siemens Munich), Claus
Rainer Rollinger (IBM Stuttgart), Jaap Hoepelman
(Fraunhofer Gesellschaft Stuttgart), and Thomas
Christaller (Gesellschaft fuer Mathematik und Datenve-
rarbeitung St. Augustin).
The range of courses was rather wide; nevertheless,
there remained sufficient coherence for students to be
able to construct individual programmes, consisting as a
rule of four of the courses (two hours, every other day)
with complementary and interconnected topics. The
present writer&apos;s selection was Kay on &amp;quot;Unification
Grammar,&amp;quot; Kilbury on &amp;quot;Parsing in PROLOG,&amp;quot; Usz-
koreit on GPSG and, further afield, Tillmann and
Schiefer on &amp;quot;Signal Processing in Experimental Phonet-
ics.&amp;quot; Reactions to the courses were varied, of course,
and tended to be polar and &amp;quot;Relevanz&amp;quot; oriented; not a
few participants were dismayed at finding so much
theoretical linguistics and so few recipes for instant NL
systems.
But the impact of the SiC Summer School on German
linguistics has already been considerable and positive,
not least in re-encouraging work among German lin-
guists in fundamental theoretical questions about lan-
guage and computability, and fostering an awareness of
the importance of &amp;quot;useful formalisms.&amp;quot; The effect of
the Summer School will undoubtedly continue to be felt
in the coming years.

This workshop/tutorial aims both to give the non-
specialist enough background to appreciate research-
level discussion and to provide the specialist with the
opportunity to conduct that discussion before a wider
audience than would normally be the case. Discussion
will focus on the relationship between the constraints
imposed by computational linguistics and formal seman-

nomena. Two kinds of presentation are planned: tutorial
introductions to relevant topics, and workshop papers
in which subjects of active research are discussed.

<abstract confidence="0.999144928571429">cloud the boundaries between the areas mentioned above even more than usual. Historically, the current upsurge of interest in computational linguistics is, then, partly associated with the factor of rising general interest in concrete applications of computers, particularly microcomputers, with the idea that experience in language-oriented computer applications may be a useful kind of qualification for language and linguistics graduates in an age when traditional occupations such as state school language teaching are on the decline. Another pragmatic factor is the current demand for research and development in natural language oriented branches of Al, in particular for German natural language access systems for databases and expert systems and in the context of machine translation, activities which have been increasing in importance over the past ten years in German universities, industry and in funding policy. A factor which has perhaps contributed less to current interest than it has elsewhere is theoretical linguistics, with an interest in computational properties of natural languages, and in developments and controversies which have motivated the development of computational tools for the development and testing of linguistic descriptions. During the past decade, linguistics in Germany has been strongly descriptive, with emphasis on empirical and interpretative research in fields such as sociolinguistics, discourse analysis, and language acquisition, with less emphasis on the formal properties of language structures and processes. The inauguration of the &amp;quot;Sektion Computerlinguistik&amp;quot; in the DGfS has re-affirmed the importance of such issues, however. A more detailed understanding of current interests may be gleaned from the SiC Summer School programme. Five types of events were offered: thematic courses, intensive practical programming courses in LISP and PROLOG (elementary and advanced), a lecture cycle by course teachers, invited and guest lectures, and panel discussions. Munich in September also offered a limitless range of additional activities, of course.</abstract>

The range of courses was rather wide; nevertheless, there remained sufficient coherence for students to be able to construct individual programmes, consisting as a rule of four of the courses (two hours, every other day) with complementary and interconnected topics.

But the impact of the SiC Summer School on German linguistics has already been considerable and positive, not least in re-encouraging work among German linguists in fundamental theoretical questions about language and computability, and fostering an awareness of the importance of &amp;quot;useful formalisms.&amp;quot; The effect of the Summer School will undoubtedly continue to be felt in the coming years.</abstract>
