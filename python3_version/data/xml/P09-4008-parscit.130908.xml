<bodyText confidence="0.9997795">
In this demo, we present a wiki-style platform –
WikiBABEL – that enables easy collaborative
creation of multilingual content in many non-
English Wikipedias, by leveraging the relatively
larger and more stable content in the English
Wikipedia. The platform provides an intuitive
user interface that maintains the user focus on
the multilingual Wikipedia content creation, by
engaging search tools for easy discoverability of
related English source material, and a set of lin-
guistic and collaborative tools to make the con-
tent translation simple. We present two different
usage scenarios and discuss our experience in
testing them with real users. Such integrated
content creation platform in Wikipedia may yield
as a by-product, parallel corpora that are critical
for research in statistical machine translation sys-
tems in many languages of the world.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999938073529412">
Parallel corpora are critical for research in many
natural language processing systems, especially,
the Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) and
Crosslingual Information Retrieval (CLIR) sys-
tems, as the state-of-the-art systems are based on
statistical learning principles; a typical SMT sys-
tem in a pair of language requires large parallel
corpora, in the order of a few million parallel
sentences. Parallel corpora are traditionally
created by professionals (in most cases, for busi-
ness or governmental needs) and are available
only in a few languages of the world. The prohi-
bitive cost associated with creating new parallel
data implied that the SMT research was re-
stricted to only a handful of languages of the
world. To make such research possible widely, it
is important that innovative and inexpensive
ways of creating parallel corpora are found. Our
research explores such an avenue: by involving
the user community in creation of parallel data.
In this demo, we present a community colla-
boration platform – WikiBABEL – which
enables the creation of multilingual content in
Wikipedia. WikiBABEL leverages two signifi-
cant facts with respect to Wikipedia data: First,
there is a large skew between the content of Eng-
lish and non-English Wikipedias. Second, while
the original content creation requires subject
matter experts, subsequent translations may be
effectively created by people who are fluent in
English and the target language. In general, we
do expect the large English Wikipedia to provide
source material for multilingual Wikipedias;
however on specific topics specific multilingual
Wikipedia may provide the source material
(http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/俳句 may be better
than http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/haiku). We
leverage these facts in the WikiBABEL frame-
work, enabling a community of interested native
speakers of a language, to create content in their
respective language Wikipedias. We make such
content creation easy by integrating linguistic
tools and resources for translation, and collabora-
tive mechanism for storing and sharing know-
ledge among the users. Such methodology is
expected to generate comparable data (similar,
but not the same content), from which parallel
data may be mined subsequently (Munteanu et
al, 2005) (Quirk et al, 2007).
We present here the WikiBABEL platform,
and trace its evolution through two distinct usage
versions: First, as a standalone deployment pro-
viding a community of users a translation plat-
form on hosted Wikipedia data to generate paral-
lel corpora, and second, as a transparent edit
layer on top of Wikipedias to generate compara-
ble corpora. Both paradigms were used for user
testing, to gauge the usability of the tool and the
viability of the approach for content creation in
multilingual Wikipedias. We discuss the imple-
mentations and our experience with each of the
above scenarios. Such experience may be very
valuable in fine-tuning methodologies for com-
munity creation of various types of linguistic
data. Community contributed efforts may per-
haps be the only way to collect sufficient corpora
effectively and economically, to enable research
in many resource-poor languages of the world.

2 Architecture of WikiBABEL
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999953432432433">
The architecture of WikiBABEL is as illustrated
in Figure 1: Central to the architecture is the Wi-
kiBABEL component that coordinates the interac-
tion between its linguistic and collaboration
components, and the users and the Wikipedia
system. WikiBABEL architecture is designed to
support a host of linguistic tools and resources
that may be helpful in the content creation
process: Bilingual dictionaries for providing for
word-level translations, allowing user customiza-
tion of domain-specific, or even, user-specific
bilingual dictionaries. Also available are ma-
chine translation and transliteration systems for
rough initial translation [or transliteration] of a
source language string at sentential/phrasal levels
[or names] to the intended target language. As
the quality of automatic translations are rarely
close to human quality translations, the user may
need to correct any such automatically translated
or transliterated content, and an intuitive edit
framework provides tools for such corrections.
A collaborative translation memory component
stores all the user corrections (or, sometimes,
their selection from a set of alternatives) of ma-
chine translations, and makes them available to
the community as a translation help („tribe know-
ledge‟). Voting mechanisms are available that
may prioritize more frequently chosen alterna-
tives as preferred suggestions for subsequent us-
ers. The user-management tracks the user de-
mographic information, and their contributions
(its quality and quantity) for possible recogni-
tion. The user interface features are imple-
mented as light-weight components, requiring
minimal server-side interaction. Finally, the ar-
chitecture is designed open, to integrate any user-
developed tools and resources easily.

3 WikiBABEL on Wikipedia
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999745333333333">
IN this section we discuss Wikipedia content and
user characteristics and outline our experience
with the two versions on Wikipedia.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.988177">
3.1 Wikipedia: User &amp; Data Characteristics
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99997923076923">
Wikipedia content is acknowledged to be on par
with the best of the professionally created re-
sources (Giles, 2005) and is used regularly as
academic reference (Rainie et al., 2007). How-
ever, there is a large disparity in content between
English and other language Wikipedias. English
Wikipedia - the largest - has about 3.5 Million
topics, but with an exception of a dozen or so
Western European and East Asian languages,
most of the 250-odd languages have less than 1%
of English Wikipedia content (Wikipedia, 2009).
Such skew, despite the size of the respective user
population, indicates a large room for growth in
many multilingual Wikipedias. On the contribu-
tion side, Wikipedia has about 200,000 contribu-
tors (&gt; 10 total contributions); but only about 4%
of them are very active (&gt; 100 contributions per
month). The general perception that a few very
active users contributed to the bulk of Wikipedia
was disputed in a study (Swartz, 2006) that
claims that large fraction of the content were
created by those who made very few or occa-
sional contributions that are primarily editorial in
nature. It is our strategy to provide a platform
for easy multilingual Wikipedia content creation
that may be harvested for parallel data.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.996579">
3.2 Version 1: A Hosted Portal
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999971">
In our first version, a set of English Wikipedia
topics (stable non-controversial articles, typically
from Medicine, Healthcare, Science &amp; Technol-
ogy, Literature, etc.) were chosen and hosted in
our WikiBABEL portal. Such set of articles is
already available as Featured Articles in most
Wikipedias. English Wikipedia has a set of
~1500 articles that are voted by the community
as stable and well written, spanning many do-
mains, such as, Literature, Philosophy, History,
Science, Art, etc. The user can choose any of
these Wikipedia topics to translate to the target
language and correct the machine translation er-
rors. Once a topic is chosen, a two-pane window
is presented to the user, as shown in Figure 2, in
which the original English Wikipedia article is
shown in the left panel and a rough translation of
the same article in the user-chosen target lan-
guage is presented in the right panel. The right
panel has the same look and feel as the original
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.996132">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.99965712">
English Wikipedia article, and is editable, while
the left panel is primarily intended for providing
source material for reference and context, for the
translation correction. On mouse-over the paral-
lel sentences are highlighted, linking visually the
related text on both panels. On a mouse-click, an
edit-box is opened in-place in the right panel,
and the current content may be edited. As men-
tioned earlier, integrated linguistic tools and re-
sources may be invoked during edit process, to
help the user. Once the article reaches sufficient
quality as judged by the users, the content may
be transferred to target language Wikipedia, ef-
fectively creating a new topic in the target lan-
guage Wikipedia.
User Feedback: We field tested our first ver-
sion with a set of Wikipedia users, and a host of
amateur and professional translators. The prima-
ry feedback we got was that such efforts to create
content in multilingual Wikipedia was well ap-
preciated. The testing provided much quantita-
tive (in terms of translation time, effort, etc.) and
qualitative (user experience) measures and feed-
back. The details are available in (Kumaran et
al., 2008), and here we provide highlights only:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.925808294117647">
• Integrated linguistic resources (e.g., bilingual
dictionaries, transliteration systems, etc.)
were appreciated by all users.
• Amateur users used the automatic translations
(in direct correlation with its quality), and
improved their throughput up to 40%.
• In contrast, those who were very fluent in
both the languages were distracted by the
quality of translations, and were slowed by
30%. In most cases, they preferred to redo
the entire translations, rather than considering
and correcting the rough translation.
• One qualitative feedback from the Wikipedia
community is that the sentence-by-sentence
translation enforced by the portal is not in
tune with their philosophy of user-decided
content for the target topic.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.993667">
We used the feedback from the version 1, to re-
design WikiBABEL in version 2.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.993032">
3.3 Version 2: As a Transparent Edit Layer
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9995455625">
In our second version, we implemented the
significant feedback from Wikipedians, pertain-
ing to source content selection and the user con-
tribution. In this version, we delivered the Wi-
kiBABEL experience as an add-on to Wikipedia,
as a semi-transparent overlay that augments the
basic Wikipedia edit capabilities without taking
the contributor away from the site. Capable of
being launched with one click (via a bookmark-
let, or a browser plug-in, or as a potential server
side integration with Wikipedia), the new version
offered a more seamless workflow and integrated
linguistic and collaborative components. This
add-on may be invoked on Wikipedia itself, pro-
viding all WikiBABEL functionalities. In a typi-
cal WikiBABEL usage scenario, a Wikipedia

<bodyText confidence="0.995895424242424">
content creator may be at an English Wikipedia
article for which no corresponding article exists
in the target language, or at target language Wi-
kipedia article which has much less content
compared to the corresponding English article.
The WikiBABEL user interface in this version
is as shown in Figure 3. The source English Wi-
kipedia article is shown in the left panel tabs, and
may be toggled between English and the target
language; also it may be viewed in HTML or in
Wiki-markup. The right panel shows the target
language Wikipedia article (if it exists), or a
newly created stub (otherwise); either case, the
right panel presents a native target language Wi-
kipedia edit page, for the chosen topic. The left
panel content is used as a reference for content
creation in target language Wikipedia in the right
panel. The user may compose the target lan-
guage Wikipedia article, either by dragging-and-
dropping translated content from the left to the
right panel (into the target language Wikipedia
editor), or add new content as a typical Wikipe-
dia user would. To enable the user to stay within
WikiBABEL for their content research, we have
provided the capability to search through other
Wikipedia articles in the left panel. All linguistic
and collaborative features are available to the
users in the right panel, as in the previous ver-
sion. The default target language Wikipedia pre-
view is at any time. While the user testing of this
implementation is still in the preliminary stages,
we wish to make the following observations on
the methodology:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.932351571428572">
• There is a marked shift of focus from
“translation from English Wikipedia article”
to “content creation in target Wikipedia”.
• The user is never taken away from Wiki-
pedia site, requiring optionally only Wikipe-
dia credentials. The content is created direct-
ly in the target Wikipedia.
</listItem>

The WikiBABEL Version 2 prototype will be
made available externally in the future.
