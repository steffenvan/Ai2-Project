In this paper, we employ the centering the-
ory in pronoun resolution from the seman-
tic perspective. First, diverse semantic role
features with regard to different predicates
in a sentence are explored. Moreover, given
a pronominal anaphor, its relative ranking
among all the pronouns in a sentence, ac-
cording to relevant semantic role informa-
tion and its surface position, is incorporated.
In particular, the use of both the semantic
role features and the relative pronominal
ranking feature in pronoun resolution is
guided by extending the centering theory
from the grammatical level to the semantic
level in tracking the local discourse focus.
Finally, detailed pronominal subcategory
features are incorporated to enhance the
discriminative power of both the semantic
role features and the relative pronominal
ranking feature. Experimental results on the
ACE 2003 corpus show that the centering-
motivated features contribute much to pro-
noun resolution.

Coreference accounts for cohesion in a text and
is, in a sense, the hyperlink for a natural lan-
guage. Especially, a coreference instance de-
notes an identity of reference and holds between
two referring expressions, which can be named
entities, definite noun phrases, pronouns and so
on. Coreference resolution is the process of link-
ing together multiple referring expressions of a
given entity in the world. The key in coreference
resolution is to determine the antecedent for
each referring expression in a text. The ability of
linking referring expressions both within a sen-
tence and across the sentences in a text is critical

to discourse and language understanding in gen-
eral. For example, coreference resolution is a
key task in information extraction, machine
translation, text summarization, and question
answering.
There is a long tradition of research on
coreference resolution within computational lin-
guistics. While earlier knowledge-lean ap-
proaches heavily depend on domain and
linguistic knowledge (Carter 1987; Carbonell
and Brown 1988) and have significantly influ-
enced the research, the later approaches usually
rely on diverse lexical, syntactic and semantic
properties of referring expressions (Soon et al.,
2001;Ng and Cardie, 2002; Zhou et al., 2004).
Current research has been focusing on exploiting
semantic information in coreference resolution.
For example, Yang et al (2005) proposed a tem-
plate-based statistical approach to compute the
semantic compatibility between a pronominal
anaphor and an antecedent candidate, and Yang
and Su (2007) explored semantic relatedness
information from automatically discovered pat-
terns, while Ng (2007) automatically induced
semantic class knowledge from a treebank and
explored its application in coreference resolution.
Particularly, this paper focuses on the center-
ing theory (Sidner,1981;Grosz et al.,1995;
Tetreault,2001), which reveals the significant
impact of the local focus on referring expres-
sions in that the antecedent of a referring expres-
sion usually depends on the center of attention
throughout the local discourse segment (Mit-
kov,1998). Although the centering theory has
been considered as a critical theory and the driv-
ing force behind the coreferential phenomena
since its proposal, its application in coreference
resolution (in particular pronoun resolution) has
been somewhat disappointing: it fails to improve
or even harms the performance of the state-of-

the-art coreference resolution systems in previ-
ous research (e.g. Yang et al. 2004). This may be
due to that centering was originally proposed as
a model of discourse coherence instead of
coreference.
The purpose of this paper is to employ the
centering theory in pronoun resolution by ex-
tending it from the grammatical level to the se-
mantic level. The intuition behind our approach
is that, via determining the semantic roles of
referring expressions in a sentence, such as
agent and patient, we can derive various center-
ing theory-motivated features in tracking the
continuity or shift of the local discourse focus,
thus allowing us to include document-level
event descriptive information in resolving the
coreferential relations between referring expres-
sions.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
research, which successfully applies the center-
ing theory in pronoun resolution from the se-
mantic perspective.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
Section 2 briefly describes related work in em-
ploying the centering theory and semantic in-
formation in coreference resolution. Then, the
centering theory is introduced in Section 3 while
Section 4 details how to employ the centering
theory from the semantic perspective. Section 5
reports and discusses the experimental results.
Finally, we conclude our work in Section 6.

2.1 Centering Theory
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999892607843138">
In the literature, there has been much research in
the centering theory and its application to
coreference resolution.
In the centering theory itself, since the origi-
nal work of Sidner (1979) on immediate focus-
ing of pronouns and the subsequent work of
Joshi and Weinstein (1981) on centering and
inferences, much research has been done, in-
cluding centering and linguistic realizations
(Cote 1993; Prince and Walker 1995), empirical
and psycholinguistic evaluation of centering
predictions (Gordon et al 1993,1995; Brennan
1995; Walker et al 1998; Kibble 2001), and the
cross-linguistic work on centering (Ziv and
Crosz1994).
In applications of the centering theory to
coreference resolution, representative work in-
cludes Brennan et al. (1987), Strube (1998),
Tetreault (1999) and Yang et al. (2004). Brennan
et al. (1987) presented a centering theory-based
formalism in modeling the local focus structure
in discourse and used it to track the discourse
context in binding occurring pronouns to corre-
sponding entities. In particular, a BFP (Brennan,
Friedman and Pollard) algorithm is proposed to
extend the original centering model to include
two additional transitions called smooth shift
and rough shift. Strube (1998) proposed an S-list
model, assuming that a referring expression pre-
fers a hearer-old discourse entity to other hearer-
new candidates. Tetreault (1999) further ad-
vanced the BFP algorithm by adopting a left-to-
right breadth first walk of the syntactic parse
trees to rank the antecedent candidates. However,
the above methods have not been systematically
evaluated on large annotated corpora, such as
MUC and ACE. Thus their effects are still un-
clear in real coreference resolution tasks. Yang
et al (2004) presented a learning-based approach
by incorporating several S-list model-based fea-
tures to improve the performance in pronoun
resolution. It shows that, although including S-
list model-based features can slightly boost the
performance in the ideal case (i.e. given the cor-
rect antecedents of anaphor’s candidates), it de-
teriorates the overall performance in F-measure
with slightly higher precision but much lower
recall, in real cases, where the antecedents of
anaphor’s candidates are determined automati-
cally by a separate coreference resolution mod-
ule.

2.2 Semantic Information
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999972294117647">
It is well known that semantic information plays
a critical role in coreference resolution. Besides
the common practice of employing a thesaurus
(e.g. WordNet) in semantic consistency check-
ing, much research has been done to explore
various kinds of semantic information, such as
semantic similarity (Harabagiu et al 2000), se-
mantic compatibility (Yang et al 2005, 2007),
and semantic class information (Soon et al 2001;
Ng 2007). Although these methods have been
proven useful in coreference resolution, their
contributions are much limited. For example, Ng
(2007) showed that semantic similarity informa-
tion and semantic agreement information could
only improve the performance of coreference
resolution by 0.6 and 0.5 in F-measure respec-
tively, on the ACE 2003 NWIRE corpus.

3 Centering Theory
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.932855777777778">
The centering theory is a theory about the local
discourse structure that models the interaction of
referential continuity and the salience of dis-
course entities in the internal organization of a
text. In natural languages, a given entity may be
referred by different expressions and act as dif-
ferent grammatical roles throughout a text. For
example, people often use pronouns to refer to
the main subject of the discourse in focus, which
can change over different portions of the dis-
course. One main goal of the centering theory is
to track the focus entities throughout a text.
The main claims of the centering theory can
be formalized in terms of Cb (the backward-
looking center), Cf (a list of forward-looking
centers for each utterance Un) and Cp (the pre-
ferred center, i.e. the most salient candidate for
subsequent utterances). Given following two

sentences: 1) Susani gave Betsyj a pet hamsterk;
2) Shei reminded herj that such hamstersk were
quite shy. We can have Ub, Uf and Up as follows:

hamster”}; Up= “Susan”.

<bodyText confidence="0.999484285714286">
Furthermore, several kinds of focus transi-
tions are defined in terms of two tests: whether
Cb stays the same (i.e. Cb(Un+1)=Cb(Un)), and
whether Cb is realized as the most prominent
referring expression (i.e. Cb(Un=Cp(Un)). We
refer to the first test as cohesion, and the second
test as salience. Therefore, there are four possi-
ble combinations, which are displayed in Table
1 and can result in four kinds of transitions,
namely Continue, Retain, Smooth Shift, and
Rough Shift. Obviously, salience, which chooses
a proper verb form to make Cb prominent within
a clause or sentence, is an important matter for
sentence planning, while cohesion, which orders
propositions in a text to maintain referential con-
tinuity, is an important matter for text planning.
Finally, the centering theory imposes several
constraints and rules over Cb/Cf and above tran-
sitions, as shown in Table 2.
Given the centering theory as described above,
we can draw the following conclusions:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.932709869565217">
1) The centering theory is discourse-related and
centers are discourse constructs.
2) The backward-looking center Cb of Un de-
pends only on the expressions that constitute
the utterance. That is, it is independent of its
surface position and grammatical roles.
Moreover, it is not constrained by any previ-
ous utterance in the segment. While the ele-
ments of Cf(Un) are partially ordered to
reflect relative prominence in Un, grammati-
cal role information is often a major determi-
nant in ranking Cf, e.g. in the descending
priority order of “Subject &gt; Object &gt; Others”
in English (Grosz and Joshi, 2001).
3) Psychological research (Gordon et al. 1993)
and cross-linguistic research (Kameyama
1986, 1988; Walker et al. 1990,1994) have
validated that Cb is preferentially realized by
a pronoun in English.
4) Frequent rough shifts would lead to a lack of
local cohesion. To keep local cohesion, peo-
ple tend to plan ahead and minimize the
number of focus shifts.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998298">
4.1 Semantic Role
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999989666666667">
A semantic role is the underlying relationship
that a participant has with a given predicate in a
clause, i.e. the actual role a participant plays in

an event, apart from linguistic encoding of the
situation. If, in some situation, someone named
“John” purposely hits someone named “Bill”,
then “John” is the agent and “Bill” is the patient
of the hitting event. Therefore, given the predi-
cate “hit” in both of the following sentences,
“John” has the same semantic role of agent and
“Bill” has the same semantic role of patient: 1)
John hit Bill. 2) Bill was hit by John.
In the literature, labeling of such semantic
roles has been well defined by the SRL (Seman-
tic Role Labeling) task, which first identifies the
arguments of a given predicate and then assigns
them appropriate semantic roles. During the last
few years, there has been growing interest in
SRL. For example, CoNLL 2004 and 2005 have
made this problem a well-known shared task.
However, there is still little consensus in the lin-
guistic and NLP communities about what set of
semantic role labels are most appropriate. Typi-
cal semantic roles include core roles, such as
agent, patient, instrument, and adjunct roles
(such as locative, temporal, manner, and cause).
For core roles, only agent and patient are consis-
tently defined across different predicates, e.g. in
the popular PropBank (Palmer et al. 2005) and
the derived version evaluated in the CoNLL
2004 and 2005 shared tasks, as ARG0 and
ARG1.
In this paper, we extend the centering theory
from the grammatical level to the semantic level
for its better application in pronoun resolution
via proper semantic role features due to three
reasons:
Sentence Grammatical Role Semantic Role
Bob opened the Bob: Bob:
door with a key. SUBJECT AGENT
The key opened The key: The key :
the door. SUBJECT INSTRUMENT
The door opened. The door: The door:
SUBJECT PATIENT

<tableCaption confidence="0.993371">
Table 3: Relationship between grammatical roles and
semantic roles: an example
</tableCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.919565771428572">
1) Semantic roles are conceptual notions,
whereas grammatical roles are morph-
syntactic. While the original centering theory
mainly builds from the grammatical perspec-
tive and grammatical roles do not always cor-
respond directly to semantic roles (Table 3
shows an example of various semantic roles
which a subject can play), there is a close re-
lationship between semantic roles and gram-
matical roles. The statistics in the CoNLL
2004 and 2005 shared tasks (Shen and Lapata,
2007) shows that the semantic roles of
ARG0/agent and ARG1/patient account for
85% of all arguments and most likely act as
the centers of the local focus structure in dis-
course due to the close relationship between
subject/object and agent/patient. Therefore, it
is appropriate to model the centers of an ut-
terance from the semantic perspective via
semantic roles.
2) In a sense, semantic roles imply the informa-
tion of grammatical roles, especially for sub-
ject/object. For example, the position of an
argument and the voice of the predicate verb
play a central role in SRL. In intuition, an ar-
gument, which occurs before an active verb
and has the semantic role of Arg0/agent,
tends to be a subject. That is to say, semantic
roles (e.g. Arg0/agent and Arg1/patient) can
be mapped into their corresponding gram-
matical roles (e.g. subject and object), using
some heuristic rules. Therefore, it would be
interesting to represent the centers of the ut-
terances and employ the centering theory
from the semantic perspective.

<listItem confidence="0.819461909090909">
3) Semantic role labeling has been well studied
in the literature and there are good ready-to-
use toolkits available. For example, Pradhan
(2005) achieved 82.2 in F-measure on the
CoNLL 2005 version of the Propbank. In
contrast, the research on grammatical role la-
beling is much less with the much lower
state-of-the-art performance of 71.2 in F-
measure (Buchholz, 1999). Therefore, it may
be better to explore the centering theory from
the semantic perspective.

4.2 Designing Centering-motivated Fea-
tures from Semantic Perspective
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997564882352941">
In this paper, the centering theory is employed in
pronoun resolution via three kinds of centering-
motivated features:
1) Semantic role features. They are achieved by
checking possible semantic roles of referring
expressions with regard to various predicates
in a sentence. Due to the close relationship
between subject/object and agent/patient, se-
mantic role information should be also a ma-
jor determinant in deciding the center of an
utterance, which is likely to be the antecedent
of a referring expression in the descending
priority order of “Agent &gt; Patient &gt; Others”
with regard to their semantic roles, corre-
sponding to the descending priority order of
“Subject &gt; Object &gt; Others” with regard to
their grammatical roles.

<page confidence="0.976818">
990
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.865623878787879">
2) Relative pronominal ranking feature. Due to
the predominance of pronouns in tracking the
local discourse structure1, the relative rank-
ing of a pronoun among all the pronouns in a
sentence should be useful in pronoun resolu-
tion. This is realized in this paper according
to its semantic roles (with regard to various
predicates in a sentence) and surface position
(in a left-to-right order) by mapping each
pronoun into 5 levels: a) rank 1 for pronouns
with semantic role ARG0/agent of the main
predicate; b) rank 2 for pronouns with seman-
tic role ARG1/patient of the main predicate; c)
rank 3 for pronouns with semantic role
ARG0/agent of other predicates; d) rank 4 for
pronouns with semantic role ARG1/patient of
other predicates; e) rank 5 for remaining pro-
nouns. Furthermore, for those pronouns with
the same ranking level, they are ordered ac-
cording to their surface positions in a left-to-
right order, motivated by previous research
on the centering theory (Grosz et al. 1995).
3) Detailed pronominal subcategory features.
Given a pronominal expression, its detailed
pronominal subcategory features, such as
whether it is a first person pronoun, second
person pronoun, third person pronoun, neuter
pronoun or others, are explored to enhance
the discriminative power of both the semantic
role features and the relative pronominal
ranking feature, considering the predominant
importance of pronouns in tracking the local
focus structure in discourse.

As a representative in explicitly employing se-
mantic role labeling in coreference resolution,
Ponzetto and Strube (2006) explored two seman-
tic role features to capture the predicate-
argument structure information to benefit
coreference resolution: I_SEMROLE, the predi-
cate-argument pairs of one referring expression,
and J_SEMROLE, the predicate-argument pairs
of another referring expression. Their experi-
ments on the ACE 2003 corpus shows that,
while the two semantic role features much im-

tion by 3.8 and 2.7 in F-measure on the BNEWS
and NWIRE domains respectively, they only

slightly improve the performance of pronoun
resolution by 0.4 and 0.3 in F-measure on the
BNEWS and NWIRE domains respectively.
In comparison, this paper proposes various
kinds of centering-motivated semantic role fea-
tures in attempt to better model the continuity or
shift in the local discourse focus by extending
the centering theory from the grammatical level
to the semantic level. For example, the
CAARG0MainVerb feature (as shown in Table
5) is designed to capture the semantic role of the
antecedent candidate in the main predicate in
modeling the discourse center, while, the AN-
PronounRanking feature (as shown in Table 5) is
designed to determinate the relative priority of
the pronominal anaphor in retaining the dis-
course center.
Although both this paper and Ponzetto and
Strube (2006) employs semantic role features,
their ways of deriving such features are much
different due to different driving
forces/motivations behind. As a result, their con-
tributions on coreference resolution are different:
while the semantic role features in Ponzette and
Strube (2006) captures the predicate-argument
structure information and contributes much to
common noun resolution and their contribution
on pronoun resolution can be ignored, the cen-
tering-motivated semantic role features in this
paper contribute much in pronoun resolution.
This justifies our attempt to better model the
continuity or shift of the discourse focus in pro-
noun resolution by extending the centering the-
ory from the grammatical level to the semantic
level and employing the centering-motivated
features in pronoun resolution..

formance in terms of recall, precision, and F-
measure, where precision measures the percent-
age of correctly-resolved pronouns (i.e. correctly
linked with any referring expression in the
coreferential chain), recall measures the cover-
age of correctly-resolved pronouns, and F-
measure gives an overall figure on equal har-
mony between precision and recall. To see
whether an improvement is significant, we also
conduct significance testing using paired t-test.

Table 5 details various centering-motivated fea-
tures from the semantic perspective, which are
incorporated in our final system. For example,
the CAARG0MainVerb feature is designed to
capture the semantic role of the antecedent can-
didate in the main predicate in modeling the dis-
course center, while the ANPronounRanking
feature is designed to determinate the relative
priority of the pronominal anaphor in retaining
the discourse center. As the baseline, we dupli-
cated the representative system with the same set
of 12 basic features, as described in Soon et al
(2001). Table 6 shows that our baseline system
achieves the state-of-the-art performance of 62.3,
65.3 and 59.0 in F-measure on the NWIRE,
NPAPER and BNEWS domains, respectively. It
also shows that the centering-motivated features
(from the semantic perspective) significantly
improve the F-measure by 3.6(&gt;&gt;&gt;), 4.5(&gt;&gt;&gt;)
and 7.7(&gt;&gt;&gt;) on the NWIRE, NPAPER and
BNEWS domains, respectively. This justifies
our attempt to model the continuity or shift of
the discourse focus in pronoun resolution via
centering-motivated features from the semantic
perspective. For comparison, we also evaluate
the performance of our final system from the
grammatical perspective. This is done by replac-
ing semantic roles with grammatical roles in
deriving centering-motivated features. Here, la-
beling of grammatical roles is achieved using a
state-of-the-art toolkit, as described in Buchholz
(1999). Table 6 shows that properly employing
the centering theory in pronoun resolution from
the grammatical perspective can also improve
the performance. However, the performance im-
provement of employing the centering theory
from the grammatical perspective is much lower,
compared with that from the semantic perspec-
tive. This validates our attempt of employing the
centering theory in pronoun resolution from the
semantic perspective instead of from the gram-
matical perspective. This also suggests the great
potential of applying the centering theory in
pronoun resolution since the centering theory is
a local coherence theory, which tells how subse-
quent utterances in a text link together.

tic role features and the relative pronominal
ranking feature in pronoun resolution when the

1) The inclusion of the semantic role features
improve the performance by 4.0(&gt;&gt;&gt;),
4.6(&gt;&gt;&gt;) and 7.3(&gt;&gt;&gt;) in F-measure on the
NWIRE, NPAPER and BNEWS domains, re-
spectively. This suggests the impact of se-
mantic role information in determining the
local discourse focus. Since pronouns prefer-
entially occur in the subject position and tend
to refer to the main subject (Ehrlich 1980;
Brennan 1995; Walker et al. 1998; Cahn
1995; Gordon and Searce 1995; Kibble et al.
2001), this paper only applies semantic fea-
tures related with the semantic role of
ARG0/agent, which is closely related with
the grammatical role of subject, with regard
to various predicates in a sentence. We have
also explored features related with other se-
mantic roles. However, our preliminary ex-
perimentation shows that they do not improve
the performance, even for ARG1/patient, and
thus are not included in the final system. This
may be due to that other semantic roles are
not discriminative enough to make a differ-
ence in deciding the local discourse structure.
2) It is surprising to notice that further inclusion
of the relative pronominal ranking feature has
only slight impact (slight positive impact on
the BNEWS domain and slight negative im-
pact on the NWIRE and NPAPER domains)
on the ACE 2003 corpus. This suggests that
most of information in the relative pronomi-
nal ranking feature has been covered by the
semantic role features. This is not surprising
since the semantic role of ARG0/agent,
which is explored to derive the semantic role
features, is also applied to decide the relative
pronominal ranking feature.
The inclusion of the relative pronominal
ranking feature improve the performance by
1.1(&gt;&gt;&gt;), 3.0(&gt;&gt;&gt;) and 5.5(&gt;&gt;&gt;) in F-measure.
Our further evaluation reveals that the perform-
ance improvement difference among different
domains of the ACE 2003 corpus is due to the
distribution of pronouns’ antecedents occurring
over different sentence distances, as shown in
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.9868474">
Table 4. This suggests the usefulness of the rela-
tive pronominal ranking feature in resolving
pronominal anaphors over longer distance. This
is consistent with our observation that, as the
percentage of pronominal anaphors referring to
more distant antecedents increase, its impact
turns gradually from negative to positive, when
further including the relative pronominal ranking
feature after the semantic role features. The rea-
son that we include the detailed pronominal sub-
category information is due to predominant
importance of pronouns in tracking the local
focus structure in discourse and that such de-
tailed pronominal subcategory information is
discriminative in tracking different subcatego-
ries of pronouns. This suggests the usefulness of
considering the distribution of the local dis-
course focus over detailed pronominal subcate-
gories. One interesting finding in our
preliminary experimentation is that the inclusion
of the detailed pronominal subcategory features
alone even harms the performance. This may be
due to the reason that the detailed pronominal
subcategory features do not have the discrimina-
tive power themselves and that the semantic role
features and the relative pronominal ranking fea-
ture provide an effective mechanism to explore
the role of such detailed pronominal subcategory
features in helping determine the local discourse
focus.

6 Conclusion and Further Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99982375">
This paper extends the centering theory from the
grammatical level to the semantic level and
much improves the performance of pronoun
resolution via centering-motivated features from
the semantic perspective. This is mainly realized
by employing various semantic role features
with regard to various predicates in a sentence,
in attempt to model the continuity or shift of the
local discourse focus. Moreover, the relative
ranking feature of a pronoun among all the pro-
nouns is explored to help determine the relative
priority of the pronominal anaphor in retaining
the local discourse focus. Evaluation on the
ACE 2003 corpus shows that both the centering-
motivated semantic role features and pronominal
ranking feature much improve the performance
of pronoun resolution, especially when the de-
tailed pronominal subcategory features of both
the anaphor and the antecedent candidate are
included. It is not surprising due to the predomi-

nance of pronouns in tracking the local discourse
structure in a text.
To our best knowledge, this paper is the first
research which successfully applies the center-
ing-motivated features in pronoun resolution
from the semantic perspective.
For future work, we will explore more kinds
of semantic information and structured syntactic
information in pronoun resolution. In particular,
we will further employ the centering theory in
pronoun resolution from both grammatical and
semantic perspectives on more corpora.

Besides the common practice of employing a thesaurus (e.g. WordNet) in semantic consistency checking, much research has been done to explore various kinds of semantic information, such as semantic similarity (Harabagiu et al 2000), semantic compatibility (Yang et al 2005, 2007), and semantic class information (Soon et al 2001; Ng 2007). Although these methods have been proven useful in coreference resolution, their contributions are much limited. For example, Ng (2007) showed that semantic similarity information and semantic agreement information could only improve the performance of coreference resolution by 0.6 and 0.5 in F-measure respectively, on the ACE 2003 NWIRE corpus. 988 3 Centering Theory The centering theory is a theory about the local discourse structure that models the interaction of referential continuity and the salience of discourse entities in the internal organization of a text.

During the last few years, there has been growing interest in SRL. For example, CoNLL 2004 and 2005 have made this problem a well-known shared task. However, there is still little consensus in the linguistic and NLP communities about what set of semantic role labels are most appropriate. Typical semantic roles include core roles, such as agent, patient, instrument, and adjunct roles (such as locative, temporal, manner, and cause). For core roles, only agent and patient are consistently defined across different predicates, e.g. in the popular PropBank (Palmer et al. 2005) and the derived version evaluated in the CoNLL 2004 and 2005 shared tasks, as ARG0 and ARG1. In this paper, we extend the centering theory from the grammatical level to the semantic level for its better application in pronoun resolution via proper semantic role features due to three reasons: Sentence Grammatical Role Semantic Role Bob opened the Bob: Bob: door with a key.

For example, the CAARG0MainVerb feature (as shown in Table 5) is designed to capture the semantic role of the antecedent candidate in the main predicate in modeling the discourse center, while, the ANPronounRanking feature (as shown in Table 5) is designed to determinate the relative priority of the pronominal anaphor in retaining the discourse center. Although both this paper and Ponzetto and Strube (2006) employs semantic role features, their ways of deriving such features are much different due to different driving forces/motivations behind. As a result, their contributions on coreference resolution are different: while the semantic role features in Ponzette and Strube (2006) captures the predicate-argument structure information and contributes much to common noun resolution and their contribution on pronoun resolution can be ignored, the centering-motivated semantic role features in this paper contribute much in pronoun resolution.

For example, coreference resolution is a key task in information extraction, machine translation, text summarization, and question answering. There is a long tradition of research on coreference resolution within computational linguistics. While earlier knowledge-lean approaches heavily depend on domain and linguistic knowledge (Carter 1987; Carbonell and Brown 1988) and have significantly influenced the research, the later approaches usually rely on diverse lexical, syntactic and semantic properties of referring expressions (Soon et al., 2001;Ng and Cardie, 2002; Zhou et al., 2004). Current research has been focusing on exploiting semantic information in coreference resolution. For example, Yang et al (2005) proposed a template-based statistical approach to compute the semantic compatibility between a pronominal anaphor and an antecedent candidate, and Yang and Su (2007) explored semantic relatedness information from automatically discovered patterns, while Ng (2007) automatically induced semantic class knowledge from a treebank and explored its application in coreference resolution.

Besides the common practice of employing a thesaurus (e.g. WordNet) in semantic consistency checking, much research has been done to explore various kinds of semantic information, such as semantic similarity (Harabagiu et al 2000), semantic compatibility (Yang et al 2005, 2007), and semantic class information (Soon et al 2001; Ng 2007). Although these methods have been proven useful in coreference resolution, their contributions are much limited. For example, Ng (2007) showed that semantic similarity information and semantic agreement information could only improve the performance of coreference resolution by 0.6 and 0.5 in F-measure respectively, on the ACE 2003 NWIRE corpus. 988 3 Centering Theory The centering theory is a theory about the local discourse structure that models the interaction of referential continuity and the salience of discourse entities in the internal organization of a text.

For example, the CAARG0MainVerb feature is designed to capture the semantic role of the antecedent candidate in the main predicate in modeling the discourse center, while the ANPronounRanking feature is designed to determinate the relative priority of the pronominal anaphor in retaining the discourse center. As the baseline, we duplicated the representative system with the same set of 12 basic features, as described in Soon et al (2001). Table 6 shows that our baseline system achieves the state-of-the-art performance of 62.3, 65.3 and 59.0 in F-measure on the NWIRE, NPAPER and BNEWS domains, respectively. It also shows that the centering-motivated features (from the semantic perspective) significantly improve the F-measure by 3.6(&gt;&gt;&gt;), 4.5(&gt;&gt;&gt;) and 7.7(&gt;&gt;&gt;) on the NWIRE, NPAPER and BNEWS domains, respectively.

The door: The door: SUBJECT PATIENT Table 3: Relationship between grammatical roles and semantic roles: an example 1) Semantic roles are conceptual notions, whereas grammatical roles are morphsyntactic. While the original centering theory mainly builds from the grammatical perspective and grammatical roles do not always correspond directly to semantic roles (Table 3 shows an example of various semantic roles which a subject can play), there is a close relationship between semantic roles and grammatical roles. The statistics in the CoNLL 2004 and 2005 shared tasks (Shen and Lapata, 2007) shows that the semantic roles of ARG0/agent and ARG1/patient account for 85% of all arguments and most likely act as the centers of the local focus structure in discourse due to the close relationship between subject/object and agent/patient. Therefore, it is appropriate to model the centers of an utterance from the semantic perspective via semantic roles. 2) In a sense, semantic roles imply the information of grammatical roles, especially for subject/object. For example, the position of an argument and the voice of the predicate verb play a central role in SRL. In intuition, an argument, whi</context>

This suggests the impact of semantic role information in determining the local discourse focus. Since pronouns preferentially occur in the subject position and tend to refer to the main subject (Ehrlich 1980; Brennan 1995; Walker et al. 1998; Cahn 1995; Gordon and Searce 1995; Kibble et al. 2001), this paper only applies semantic features related with the semantic role of ARG0/agent, which is closely related with the grammatical role of subject, with regard to various predicates in a sentence. We have also explored features related with other semantic roles. However, our preliminary experimentation shows that they do not improve the performance, even for ARG1/patient, and thus are not included in the final system.
