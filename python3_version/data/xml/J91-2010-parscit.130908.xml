This book addresses the general question of whether language is governed by rules
or by analogy. Skousen&apos;s contribution to the long-standing debate on the subject is
of primary importance, for he brings new arguments and a new kind of evidence
into the discussion. Broadly speaking, Skousen constructs a computational model of
a certain kind of analogical inference and tests it against empirical data in a series of
experiments. This allows him to demonstrate that analogy accounts for what has been
traditionally described by means of rules, and furthermore, that it predicts instances
of variation and historical change that are otherwise difficult to explain.
In order to appreciate appropriately the import of Skousen&apos;s book, an historical
background is needed. Unfortunately, Skousen draws a rather simplistic picture of
the rules-versus-analogy controversy, paying more attention to conceptual distinctions
than to historical facts. Generally, he contrasts his analogical approach to language
with a broadly understood structuralist approach, which he attributes to de Saussure,
Chomsky, and the Young Grammarians. However, while Chomsky indeed conceives
of language as a rule-governed device and discredits analogy as a vague metaphor
(Chomsky 1966, p. 12), de Saussure was well aware of the role of analogy in language
use, language change, and language acquisition. Among the Young Grammarians, Paul
too recognized the functioning of analogy in language (cf. Jespersen 1922, pp. 44-45),
and so did many other linguists in the past (see Anttila 1977 for a state-of-the-art
report).
Obviously, Skousen&apos;s approach to analogy is radically different from that of the
older writers. One difference is that he gives an explicit definition of analogy, as if in
response to a criticism such as Chomsky&apos;s (cf. above) and Langacker&apos;s (1967, p. 22),
who remarks that since both grammatical and ungrammatical sentences may be the
outcome of analogical inference, analogy is not a credible explanation of the human
ability to create and understand novel sentences. A weak point in Langacker&apos;s ar-
gument is that he derives his &amp;quot;false analogies&amp;quot; from individual sentences, e.g. I like
kittens, I like snow, Kittens are white, hence *Snow are white. In Skousen&apos;s model, on the
other hand, analogical inference is based on all relevant examples of usage stored in
the speaker&apos;s mind.
Another difference between Skousen&apos;s approach to analogy and the traditional
one results from his attitude toward rules. These are not used in his model, in contrast
to the usual practice of employing rules to account for what is regular in language
and invoking analogy only when irregularities have to be explained. A more recent
view, that the rules/analogy distinction corresponds to the competence/performance
dichotomy (e.g. Smith and Wilson 1979, pp. 202-203), is not shared by Skousen either.
He makes his position quite clear in the last chapter, where he claims that rules are not

used in human language processing, and owe their existence entirely to linguists who
invent them. He gives no reason, however, for this strong claim, except for a certain
analogy he draws between linguistics and physics.
Perhaps the most serious drawback of Skousen&apos;s book is that it does not provide a
sufficiently general description of his analogical model. Evidently, Skousen expects his
readers to learn from examples how the model works and why it has been designed
the way it has. True, he gives some details of the statistical basis of his approach, but
these are very sketchy, probably for reasons of space. A Pascal program written for one
of the applications of the model is by no means a substitute for a general, preferably
algorithmic, description. Similarly, a reference to another book by Skousen, Analogy
and Structure, does not help much, since the book has not been published yet.
Worst of all, it is unclear for a rather long time which particular kind of analogy is
modeled in Analogical Modeling of Language. Again, only examples show that predictive
analogy is concerned. The task of Skousen&apos;s model, given a context specified as a list
of variables, is to predict the language behavior of the speaker (the outcome). The
task is performed in two steps. First, an analogical set is generated that consists of
all contextâ€”outcome pairs stored in the speaker&apos;s memory and relevant to the given
context. Then a rule of usage is employed in order to predict the outcome for the
given context on the basis of the analogical set. For instance, social variables such as
the sex, age, and social class of the speaker are used in one of the experiments, and
the outcomes predicted are forms of address in colloquial Egyptian Arabic. In another
experiment, the English indefinite article is predicted, and the contexts are specified
by listing particular phonemes and their category membership.
There are several limitations of Skousen&apos;s model, not all of them mentioned in
the book. First, the model has been shown to cope well with predicting the speaker&apos;s
language behavior, but it is less clear whether it could also account for the hearer&apos;s
ability to understand novel sentences. One possibility is to put sentences into the
contexts and to treat their semantic representations as the outcomes. However, none
of the experiments described in the book is concerned with modeling natural language
understanding, and the question of whether Skousen&apos;s model could be used to this
end is left open.
Second, the list of variables used to specify the contexts has to be defined in
advance, and it is the experimenter who decides which variables should be included
in the list and which may be not. True, the exact role of particular variables need not
be known initially, and in principle there is nothing wrong in considering variables
that will eventually prove irrelevant to the speaker&apos;s behavior. No relevant variable,
however, may be omitted from the list, which means that though independent of rules,
Skousen&apos;s model is still dependent on some general knowledge of a given language,
albeit expressed in a less direct form. It is an interesting question of how the model
could be developed in order to acquire the knowledge itself.
Third, the time and memory required by Skousen&apos;s algorithm for generating the
analogical set grow exponentially with the number of variables. The running time
can be reduced by using parallel processing, but it was memory rather than time
limitations that forced Skousen, working with a 640 KB computer, to use not more than
twelve variables in any of his experiments. This small number proved to be big enough
to test Skousen&apos;s model on the data usually considered by language variationists, but
it may be insufficient for more complex tasks, such as predicting the form of a verb
required by a given coordinated subject.
Despite its shortcomings, the book under review merits the attention of every-
one having some theoretical interest in natural language modeling. Bold and novel,
Skousen&apos;s analogical approach is a worthwhile alternative to the connectionist models

mentioned above indicate the direction of this research.
