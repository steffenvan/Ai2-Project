English. This is particularly so in the early part of the
book. When making a proposal, they often examine
several possibilities which are all plausible in their frame-
work. This should be welcomed by readers with only
limited exposure to formal semantics.
The authors address methodological issues at several
points, since their main concern is the presentation of a
fragment. Nevertheless, it would have been useful for the
authors to situate their work more explicitly by indicating
what a boolean emphasis has added to semantics, what
areas are likely to benefit from a similar approach, and
what problems will require new methods. This book
shows that the algebraic approach offers much of interest
to semantics.

The book combines the work of authors from different
fields of research: Radday is a Bible scholar, and as a
matter of fact, was the first to introduce statistical
computational methods into Bible study in Israel; Pollat-
schek is specializing now in operations research and
computer techniques. Both are at the Technion. Shore
carries titles in industrial engineering and operations
research, as well as in philosophy and psychology. Wick-
man teaches mathematics and statistics at the Technische
Hochschule in Aachen, FRG. Rabin is from the field of
classical and modern Hebrew and Arabic linguistics, and
Talmon is Magness Professor of Bible Studies. Both
these latter scholars are from the Hebrew University of
Jerusalem.
The goal of this study was to examine the authorship
of the Book of Genesis. Textual and epexegetical diffi-
culties in this book roused theories, such as Wellhausen&apos;s,
that the Book had not been written originally by one
hand, or that a later editor edited material written by
several (at least three) previous writers. This
&amp;quot;documentary theory&amp;quot; is investigated in the study in
three phases:
Phase I general statistics;
Phase II statistics of linguistic data;
Phase III vocabulary statistics.
The text of Genesis was divided into three parts:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.997608272727273">
(1) Sort of Text:
N (Narrative);
H (Human speaker);
D (Divine speech);
(2) Documentary Source (following Wellhausen&apos;s
theory):
J (text pieces using the letters JHWH for God),
E (text parts using the word Elohim for God),
and
P (representing a priestly writer);
(3) Division I, II, III, according to story-type, namely

<bodyText confidence="0.999789485714286">
the first cycle of stories of the creation, the flood
etc., the heroic stories of the Fathers, and the cycle
of stories about Joseph. The creation story of the
first chapter and Jacob&apos;s blessing were excluded
since they were linguistically too deviant.
Further slicing of each of the above classes yielded
text sequences of about 200 words each, which were
convenient for statistical analysis. Each sample was
statistically examined for 54 linguistic items in the areas
of word length (2 to 10 characters); certain nominal and
verbal morphology elements; syntactical elements; and
frequency of inter-word transfers, such as noun/noun,
noun/verb, noun/pronoun, and noun/stop. These
features are unique for any writer, and cannot be
consciously manipulated. They therefore reveal the writ-
er&apos;s individual style and may corroborate assumptions
concerning the text&apos;s author. Statistical results show
minute differences per item; but when all details are
collected, consistent facts of certain linguistic features
emerge and yield a complex picture of the linguistic
structure of the text.
In Phase I the univariate analysis of variance revealed
that J and E were indistinguishable from one another,
while P was strikingly unlike either. Also, NP was heter-
ogeneous, while NJ and NE were not. The multivariate
analysis of variance demonstrated the same pattern of
differences among the documents. P appeared to be of
an independent source, while J and E bore very close
resemblances.
In the analysis of the sorts of discourse, N is complete-
ly unlike H and D in any document. Seventeen out of 39
variables were found to be powerful discriminants
between N and H+D. All the results of these analyses
mean that the Narrator behaves linguistically in a signif-
icantly different fashion from the speakers.

From the aspect of divisions, it is shown that Division
I is quite unlike Divisions II and III. In Division I were
included most of J and P, and in Division III most of E.
E appears for the first time in Division II, and from there
it has approximately the same share as J. Division II is
gradually and increasingly individualized, and fully
human true-life portraits appear in Division III, while
Division I has a quasi-mythical nature.
In Phase II, the aim was to let the features arrange
themselves into groups of themselves, as it were, without
any preconceptions. Five analysis methods were applied,
and cluster analysis yielded a most interesting picture of
interrelations among the text samples (figures 3.11, 3.12,
pp. 136-7). The first cluster comprised samples of Text
P. The second cluster comprised most of the N samples
outside P. The third cluster encompassed all the H and D
samples, regardless of their E or J origin. The authors
write explicitly (p. 186): &amp;quot;This adds force . . . to the
impression that the Jahwist and the Elohist were each
other&apos;s alter ego&amp;quot;. The other analyses supported this
finding.
Lexical richness and lexical concentration were sepa-
rately examined, yielding results in three different ranges
of vocabulary for N,H,D (Fig. 4.3) and J,E,P (Fig. 4.4).
Here, too, P is unlike the other groups. After the statis-
tical analysis the authors consider it justified that N,H,D
should be distinct. It is doubtful, to their mind, whether
J,E,P should be ascribed to three different sources. They
summarize this issue as follows: &amp;quot;While solely on these
grounds this [documentary] hypothesis cannot be
rejected out of hand, such serious doubts regarding its
validity have arisen that neither can it any longer be
accepted as unreservedly as it has been hitherto.&amp;quot; (p.
214)
Rabin in his contribution is not surprised that the
sources of discourse have been found so distinctive.
Indeed, modern linguistics tends to take into account
various extra-linguistic (psycholinguistic and sociolinguis-
tic) factors that yield distinct linguistic patterns in
dialogue, narration, etc. Narrative is known to differ
from direct speech in various linguistic elements, such as
use of pronouns, verb tenses, and demonstratives. It is,
then, little wonder that Deity should use an elevated
style, full of rhetorical elements on the one hand, and
complete and complex sentences on the other, as found
in Genesis. He suggests examining the Book according
to discourse analysis techniques and the comparison of
results.
Talmon warns the reader against the spell of modern
technological aids, since another computer-aided study of
a part of Genesis by a French scholar has yielded differ-
ent results. He notes that N predominates all over the
text of Genesis, with 53% of Division III, 56% of Divi-
sion II, and 74% of Division I. H increases from 5% in
Division Ito 34% in Division II and 47% in Division III.
D, however, decreases from 21% in Division Ito 10% in
Division II and complete absence in Division III. This
internal consistency leads him to suggest that N may
have used pre-existing Canaanite or generally known
Mesopotamian material. Talmon stresses that the kind of
text analysis as applied in this book is really a literary
analysis, which fits well with modern trends of Bible
scholarship.
Belonging to the linguists&apos; part of the expected reading
public (which according to the writers includes &amp;quot;Bible
scholars, linguists, statisticians, and probably computer
people&amp;quot;), I find this book interesting to study. The start-
ing point of the documentary hypothesis is concisely and
clearly summarized. The statistical methods of each
phase are clearly described, and are illustrated by tables,
figures, and appendices. The findings appear at the end
of each statistical analysis, with a brief summary of the
results (without the numbers). It may be noted that
there is no list of references, and references to the litera-
ture appear as footnotes. Appendices are said to be four
in number, but only three exist, although &amp;quot;appendices 3
and 4&amp;quot; comprise various sub-sections. There is also a
printing mismatch of the number of counted words
between the text (p. 192) and table 4.1 (p. 193) and
exhibit 4.1 (p. 129).
The results of this study make us hope this is not the
last word on the subject (see &amp;quot;Suggestions for further
investigation and two examples&amp;quot; pp. 187-189, and
&amp;quot;Interim Postscript&amp;quot; pp. 216-217). Subsequent studies,
perhaps with more details of the linguistic features prop-
er, are to be awaited.

In this optimistically-titled book, Reichman presents a
theory of discourse processing that is intended to be the
basis for a computational module. The claim is that this
would give a full-scale natural language processing
system the capacity to generate and interpret extended
coherent discourse, rather than just short utterances.
The module would be one of the many that make up such
a system, although Reichman does not consider what
other components would be required, and how they
would interact with the discourse module.
The module would keep a dynamically-updated record
of the discourse it is engaged in, in such a way as to help
it to produce conversational moves that are relevant to
the discourse and contain correct use of pronominaliza-
tion and other discourse phenomena. Reichman provides
