This paper proposes a method that automatically
acquires the SM (semantic attributes) of user defined
words. Applying this method to the compilation of a user
dictionary targeting newspaper article sentences and
sentences of software design documents has revealed that
the automatically determined SM include 50 to 80% of
the correct attributes. Translation experiments confirmed
that the automatically acquired SM improved translation
quality by 6-13%.

1. Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999877894736842">
When working with a MT(machine translation) system,
users compile user dictionaries for the words which are not
registered in the system dictionaries or for those with
inappropriate translations [1]. But when registering new
words in a dictionary, there is a need to give not just the
index word and translated word, but also syntactic,
semantic and various other information. Systems aiming at
higher levels of translation quality require more detailed
and accurate information [2,3], and it is no simple task for
laymen to give such information. In particular, semantic
information usually requires the skill of professionals.
In this paper, attention has been focused on the
characteristics of user defined words. A method is
proposed where for index words (noun words or compound
nouns) in the original language that users seek to register,
one need give only the translation in the target language to
permit the system apply the knowledge held in the system
dictionaries, automatically judge the type of noun and
determine the SM of the word for the noun types.

Here, we shall refer to the dictionary prepared in
advance by the MT system as a system dictionary and the
dictionary prepared and used by users as a user dictionary.
For the case of the Japanese to English MT system
ALT— J/E[4], the relationship between the system
dictionaries, the user dictionaries and word SM are shown
in Figure 1. In the semantic dictionaries, semantic
information is written using SM.
Common nouns in the semantic word dictionary are
given common noun SM (generally more than one). For
proper nouns, both common noun SM and proper noun
SAs(both more than one) are given. Verbal SM are given
to sentence patterns registered in the semantic structure
dictionary [5].

A method of determining the SM of user defined words
is shown in Figure 2. This method works using the
information held in the system dictionaries when index
words (Japanese expressions) of user defined words and
their translations(English) have been provided by the user.

It can be seen in table 4 that using the automatically
determined SAs improved the translation quality by
6-13%. This improvement is almost the same as that
achieved with manually determined SAs. The translation
success rate is 2-3% lower than that achieved with the
correct attributes. This is, however, satisfactory if we
consider the high cost needed to obtain the correct
attribute by repeatedly tuning them.
Thus, automatic determination makes it possible to
acquire useful sets of SAs; a task which normally requires
the most labor in creating user dictionaries.

6. Summary
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999915">
A method that automatically determines the SAs of user
defined words was proposed. The method was applied to
create the dictionaries needed to translate several
newspaper articles and some software specifications. The
results show that the automatically determined SAs
include 50 to 80% of the correct attributes. This value is
5-10% smaller than that achieved with manual
determination (50 90%), but is still high enough to
improve translation quality. Translation experiments
confirmed that using the automatically determined SAs
improved translation quality by 6-13%.
