Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999911888888889">
In this paper, we demonstrate how to
mine large-scale parallel corpora with
multilingual patents, which have not
been thoroughly explored before. We
show how a large-scale English-Chinese
parallel corpus containing over 14
million sentence pairs with only 1-5%
wrong can be mined from a large amount
of English-Chinese bilingual patents. To
our knowledge, this is the largest single
parallel corpus in terms of sentence pairs.
Moreover, we estimate the potential for
mining multilingual parallel corpora
involving English, Chinese, Japanese,
Korean, German, etc., which would to
some extent reduce the parallel data
acquisition bottleneck in multilingual
information processing.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999921159090909">
Multilingual data are critical resources for
building many applications, such as machine
translation (MT) and cross-lingual information
retrieval. Many parallel corpora have been built,
such as the Canadian Hansards (Gale and
Church, 1991), the Europarl corpus (Koehn,
2005), the Arabic-English and English-Chinese
parallel corpora used in the NIST Open MT
Evaluation.
However, few parallel corpora exist for many
language pairs, such as Chinese-Japanese,
Japanese-Korean, Chinese- French or
Japanese-German. Even for language pairs with
several parallel corpora, such as Chinese-English
and Arabic-English, the size of parallel corpora
is still a major limitation for SMT systems to
achieve higher performance.
In this paper, we present a way which could, to
some extent, reduce the parallel data acquisition
bottleneck in multilingual language processing.
Based on multilingual patents, we show how an
enlarged English-Chinese parallel corpus
containing over 14 million high-quality sentence
pairs can be mined from a large number of
comparable patents harvested from the Web. To
our knowledge, this is the largest single parallel
corpus in terms of parallel sentences. Some SMT
experiments are also reported. Moreover, we
investigate the potential to get large-scale
parallel corpora for languages beyond the
Canadian Hansards, Europarl and UN news used
in NIST MT Evaluation by estimating the
quantity of multilingual patents involving
English, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, German,
etc.
Related work is introduced in Section 2.
Patents, PCT patents, multilingual patents are
described in Section 3. Then an English-Chinese
parallel corpus, its mining process and
application to SMT are introduced in Section 4,
followed by the quantity estimation of
multilingual patents involving other language
pairs in Section 5. We discuss the results in
Section 6, and conclude in Section 7.

Parallel sentences could be extracted from
parallel documents or comparable corpora.
Different approaches have been proposed to
align sentences in parallel documents consisting
of the same content in different languages based
on the following information: a) the sentence
length in bilingual sentences (Brown et al. 1991;
Gale and Church, 1991); b) lexical information
in bilingual dictionaries (Ma, 2006); c) statistical
translation model (Chen, 1993), or the composite
of more than one approach (Simard and
Plamondon, 1998; Moore, 2002).
To overcome the lack of parallel documents,
comparable corpora are also used to mine
parallel sentences, which raises further
challenges since the bilingual contents are not
strictly parallel. For instance, Zhao and Vogel
(2002) investigated the mining of parallel
sentences for Web bilingual news. Munteanu and
Marcu (2005) presented a method for
discovering parallel sentences in large Chinese,
Arabic, and English comparable, non-parallel
corpora based on a maximum entropy classifier.
Cao et al., (2007) and Lin et al., (2008) proposed
two different methods utilizing the parenthesis
pattern to extract term translations from bilingual
web pages. Jiang et al. (2009) presented an
adaptive pattern-based method which produced
Chinese-English bilingual sentences and terms
with over 80% accuracy.
Only a few papers were found on the related
work in the patent domain. Higuchi et al. (2001)
used the titles and abstracts of 32,000
Japanese-English bilingual patents to extract
bilingual terms. Utiyama and Isahara (2007)
mined about 2 million parallel sentences by
using two parts in the description section of
Japanese-English comparable patents. Lu et al.
(2009) derived about 160K parallel sentences
from Chinese-English comparable patents by
aligning sentences and filtering alignments with
the combination of different quality measures.
Another closely related work is the
English-Chinese parallel corpus (Lu et al.,
2010), which is largely extended by this work, in
which both the number of patents and that of
parallel sentences are augmented by about
100%, and more SMT experiments are given.
Moreover, we show the potential for mining
parallel corpora from multilingual patents
involving other languages.
For statistical machine translation (SMT),
tremendous strides have been made in two
decades, including Brown et al. (1993), Och and
Ney (2004) and Chiang (2007). For the MT
evaluation, NIST (Fujii et al., 2008; 2010) has
been organizing open evaluations for years, and
the performance of the participants has been
improved rapidly.

application also in Chinese under the PCT. Later
on, it may have the patent translated into English
and file it in USA patent office, which means the
patent becomes bilingual. If the applicant
continues to file it in Japan with Japanese, it
would be trilingual. Even more, it would be
quadrilingual or involve more languages when it
is filed in other countries with more languages.
Such multilingual patents are considered
comparable (or noisy parallel) because they are
not parallel in the strict sense but still closely
related in terms of information conveyed

<bodyText confidence="0.999857392857143">
The official patent office in China is the State
Intellectual Property Office (SIPO). In early
2009, by searching on its website, we found
about 200K Chinese patents previously filed as
PCT applications in English and crawled their
bibliographical data, titles, abstracts and the
major claim from the Web, and then other claims
and descriptions were also added. Since some
contents are in the image format, the images
were OCRed and the texts recognized were
manually verified.
All PCT patent applications are filed through
WIPO. With the Chinese patents mentioned
above, the corresponding English patents were
searched from the website of WIPO by the PCT
publication numbers to obtain relevant sections
of the English PCT applications, including
bibliographical data, title, abstract, claims and

Chinese patents found their corresponding
English ones. Some contents of the English

4.2 Mining Parallel Sentences from
Bilingual Patents

<bodyText confidence="0.997167580645161">
The sentences in each section of Chinese patents
were aligned with those in the corresponding
section of the corresponding English patents to
find parallel sentences after the Chinese
sentences were segmented into words.
Since the comparable patents are not strictly
parallel, the individual alignment methods
mentioned in Section 2 would be not effective: 1)
the length-based method is not accurate since it
does not consider content similarity; 2) the
bilingual dictionary-based method cannot deal
with new technical terms in the patents; 3) the
translation model-based method would need
training data to get a translation model. Thus, in
this study we combine these three methods to
mine high-quality parallel sentences from
comparable patents.
We first use a bilingual dictionary to
preliminarily align the sentences in each section
of the comparable patents. The dictionary-based
similarity score Pd of a sentence pair is
computed based on a bilingual dictionary as
follows (Utiyama and Isahara, 2003):
where wc and we are respectively the
word types in Chinese sentence Sc and
English sentence Se; lc and le respectively
denote the lengths of Sc and Se in terms of
the number of words; and γ(wc, we) = 1 if
wc and we is a translation pair in the
bilingual dictionary or are the same string,
otherwise 0; and

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.994552681818182">
For the bilingual dictionary, we combine three
ones: namely, LDC_CE_DIC2.0 5 constructed
by LDC, bilingual terms in HowNet and the
bilingual lexicon in Champollion (Ma, 2006).
We then remove sentence pairs using length
filtering and ratio filtering: 1) for length filtering,
if a sentence pair has more than 100 words in the
English sentence or more than 333 characters in
the Chinese one, it is removed; 2) for length ratio
filtering, we discard the sentence pairs with
Chinese-English length ratio outside the range of
0.8 to 1.8. The parameters here are set
empirically.
We further filter the parallel sentence
candidates by learning an IBM Model-1 on the
remaining aligned sentences and compute the
translation similarity score Pt of sentence
pairs by combining the translation probability
value of both directions (i.e. Chinese-&gt;English
and English-&gt;Chinese) based on the trained
IBM-1 model (Moore, 2002; Chen, 2003; Lu et
al, 2009). It is computed as follows:

The websites from which the Chinese and

slow to access, and were occasionally down
during access. To avoid too much workload for
the websites, the downloading speed had been
limited. Some large patents would cost much
time for the websites to respond and had be
specifically handled. It took considerable efforts
to obtain these comparable patents.

applications as the pivot could be easily
extended to other language pairs as illustrated in
Section 5.
2) The translation process is different: their
patents were filed in USA Patent Office in
English by translating from Japanese or Chinese,
while our patents were first filed in English as a
PCT application, and later translated into
Chinese. The different translation processes may
have different characteristics.
Since the PCT and multilingual patent
applications increase rapidly in recent years as
discussed in Section 3, we could expect more
multilingual patents to enlarge the large-scale
parallel corpora with the new applications and
keep them up-to-date with new technical terms.
On the other hand, patents are usually translated
by patent agents or professionals, we could
expect high quality translations from
multilingual patents. We have been planning to
build trilingual and quadrilingual corpora from
multilingual patents.
One possible limitation of patent corpora is
that the sentences are all from technical domains
and written in formal style, and thus it is
interesting to know if the parallel sentences
could improve the performance of SMT systems
on NIST MT evaluation corpus containing news
sentences and web sentences.

7 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999961571428572">
In this paper, we show how a large high-quality
English-Chinese parallel corpus can be mined
from a large amount of comparable patents
harvested from the Web, which is the largest
single parallel corpus in terms of the number of
parallel sentences. Some sampled parallel
sentences are available at
http://www.livac.org/smt/parpat.html, and more
parallel sentences would be publicly available to
the research community.
With 1.7 million PCT patent applications and
their corresponding national ones, there are
considerable potentials of constructing
large-scale high-quality parallel corpora for
languages. We give an estimation on the sizes of
multilingual parallel corpora which could be
obtained from multilingual patents involving
English, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, German,
etc., which would to some extent reduce the
parallel data acquisition bottleneck in
multilingual information processing.

We show how a large-scale English-Chinese parallel corpus containing over 14 million sentence pairs with only 1-5% wrong can be mined from a large amount of English-Chinese bilingual patents.

Later on, it may have the patent translated into English and file it in USA patent office, which means the patent becomes bilingual. If the applicant continues to file it in Japan with Japanese, it would be trilingual. Even more, it would be quadrilingual or involve more languages when it is filed in other countries with more languages. Such multilingual patents are considered comparable (or noisy parallel) because they are not parallel in the strict sense but still closely related in terms of information conveyed (Higuchi et al., 2001; Lu et al., 2009). 4 A Large English-Chinese Parallel Corpus Mined from Bilingual Patents In this section, we introduce the English-Chinese bilingual patents harvested from the Web and the method to mine parallel sentences from them. SMT experiments on the final parallel corpus are also described. 4.1 Harvesting English-Chinese Bilingual Patents The official patent office in China is the State Intellectual Property Office (SIPO). In early 2009, by searching on its website, we found about 200K Chinese patents previously filed as PCT applications in English and crawled their bibliographical dat</context>

Korea. 6 Discussion The websites from which the Chinese and English patents were downloaded were quite slow to access, and were occasionally down during access. To avoid too much workload for the websites, the downloading speed had been limited. Some large patents would cost much time for the websites to respond and had be specifically handled. It took considerable efforts to obtain these comparable patents. In addition our English-Chinese corpus mined in this study is at least one order of magnitude larger, we give some other differences between ours and those introduced in Section 2 (Higuchi et al., 2001; Utiyama and Isahara, 2007; Lu et al, 2009) 1) Their bilingual patents were identified by the priority information in the US patents, and could not be easily extended to language pairs without English; while our method using PCT applications as the pivot could be easily extended to other language pairs as illustrated in Section 5. 2) The translation process is different: their patents were filed in USA Patent Office in English by translating from Japanese or Chinese, while our patents were first filed in English as a PCT application, and later translated into Chinese.

Later on, it may have the patent translated into English and file it in USA patent office, which means the patent becomes bilingual. If the applicant continues to file it in Japan with Japanese, it would be trilingual. Even more, it would be quadrilingual or involve more languages when it is filed in other countries with more languages. Such multilingual patents are considered comparable (or noisy parallel) because they are not parallel in the strict sense but still closely related in terms of information conveyed (Higuchi et al., 2001; Lu et al., 2009). 4 A Large English-Chinese Parallel Corpus Mined from Bilingual Patents In this section, we introduce the English-Chinese bilingual patents harvested from the Web and the method to mine parallel sentences from them. SMT experiments on the final parallel corpus are also described. 4.1 Harvesting English-Chinese Bilingual Patents The official patent office in China is the State Intellectual Property Office (SIPO). In early 2009, by searching on its website, we found about 200K Chinese patents previously filed as PCT applications in English and crawled their bibliographical data, titles, abstrac</context>

The parameters here are set empirically. We further filter the parallel sentence candidates by learning an IBM Model-1 on the remaining aligned sentences and compute the translation similarity score Pt of sentence pairs by combining the translation probability value of both directions (i.e. Chinese-&gt;English and English-&gt;Chinese) based on the trained IBM-1 model (Moore, 2002; Chen, 2003; Lu et al, 2009). It is computed as follows: |) ( | S ) log P(S S + c c e = lc +le where P(Se |Sc) denotes the probability that a translator will produce Se in English when presented with Sc in Chinese, and vice versa for P(Sc |Se) . Sentence pairs with p S S = d c e ( , ) ( le +l) / 2 I I e deg(wc) deg(we γ(wc , we) ) deg( pt (Sc, Se) log(P(Se ) ) 5 http://projects.ldc.upenn.edu/Chinese/LDC_ch.htm similarity score Pt lower than a predefined threshold are filtered out as wrong aligned sentences.

<context position="3965" citStr="Zhao and Vogel (2002)" startWordPosition="558" endWordPosition="561">parallel documents consisting of the same content in different languages based on the following information: a) the sentence length in bilingual sentences (Brown et al. 1991; Gale and Church, 1991); b) lexical information in bilingual dictionaries (Ma, 2006); c) statistical translation model (Chen, 1993), or the composite of more than one approach (Simard and Plamondon, 1998; Moore, 2002). To overcome the lack of parallel documents, comparable corpora are also used to mine parallel sentences, which raises further challenges since the bilingual contents are not strictly parallel. For instance, Zhao and Vogel (2002) investigated the mining of parallel sentences for Web bilingual news. Munteanu and Marcu (2005) presented a method for discovering parallel sentences in large Chinese, Arabic, and English comparable, non-parallel corpora based on a maximum entropy classifier. Cao et al., (2007) and Lin et al., (2008) proposed two different methods utilizing the parenthesis pattern to extract term translations from bilingual web pages. Jiang et al. (2009) presented an adaptive pattern-based method which produced Chinese-English bilingual sentences and terms with over 80% accuracy. Only a few papers were found </context>
