This volume collects the proceedings of the International and Interdisciplinary Confer-
ence on Modelling and Using Context, held in Rio de Janeiro in January 1997, which
proved to be the first in a series. (The second was held in Trento in 1999, the third in
Dundee in 2001.)
The theory of context is important and problematic—problematic because the intu-
itions are confused, because of the disparate disciplines that are involved, and because
the chronic problem in cognitive science of how to arrive at a productive relation be-
tween formalizations and applications applies with particular force to this area. This
uneven but interesting volume illustrates all of these points.
&amp;quot;Formal and computational models of context for natural language generation&amp;quot;
by Kees van Deemter and Jan Odijk illustrates the point concerning theory and prac-
tice. Concentrating on the generation of appropriate pitch accents in monologues, it
is essentially a system description, emphasizing constraints on desirable output and
functionality of system components. It is impossible to tell from the description how
principled and portable the system is, or what the relation is to the relevant theo-
ries.
&amp;quot;Requirements for dialogue context management&amp;quot; by Harry Bunt is mainly con-
cerned with producing an eclectic assortment of categories for thinking about contexts.
&amp;quot;Contextual constraints on thematization in written discourse: An empirical study&amp;quot;
by Julia Lavid describes a corpus study of &amp;quot;chaining strategies&amp;quot; in various genres. The
author hopes that the corpus will be useful in generation applications.
&amp;quot;Context and implicitness: Consequences for traditional and computer-assisted
text analysis&amp;quot; by Mark Galliker and Daniel Weimer represents the inverse relation
between importance of the application area and strength of the methodology. This ap-
plication of social psychology to texts involving the expression of prejudice is highly
subjective and appears to lack a methodology for analyzing and evaluating the rele-
vant texts.
&amp;quot;A context-based mechanization of multi-agent reasoning&amp;quot; by Alessandro Cimatti
and Luciano Serafini discusses a formalization and mechanization of the reasoning
involved in the &amp;quot;three wise men puzzle&amp;quot; in a belief-contexts framework (Giunchiglia
1993). The paper would be hard to understand without some familiarity with this
material. The wise-men puzzle is not a toy problem, but it would be good to know
how to use the framework to deal with more realistic examples. It would be good to
know what the advantages are of this approach compared with multimodal theorem-

proving (Gasquet 1995; Stone 1998). The belief-context approach appears to be more
flexible, but I am not sure whether the flexibility is needed for the desired applications.
&amp;quot;Presuppositions in context: Constructing bridges&amp;quot; by Paul Piwek and Emiel Krah-
mer deals with bridging anaphora—constructions such as Bill&apos;s car wouldn&apos;t run; the fuel
line was clogged. Such constructions are one of the more promising domains for explor-
ing interactions between commonsense knowledge and natural language interpreta-
tion. This article combines van der Sandt&apos;s theory of presupposition (van der Sandt
1992) with Constructive Type Theory (Martin-Lof 1984) in a creative way to tackle this
problem—the basic idea is that the information needed for this inference can often be
extracted from a proof. This is a good example of the sort of interdisciplinary work
that can be most productive in this area of research.
&amp;quot;Reasoning with multilevel contexts in semantic metanetworks&amp;quot; by Vagan Y. Terzi-
yan and Seppo Puuronen deals with semantic nets that are partitioned into a semantic
hierarchy. The semantics for the formalism is murky. The only advantage to semantic
network formalisms that I am aware of is that the graphical structure can support
useful algorithms; but this paper does not discuss algorithms at all.
&amp;quot;Contextual learning: Towards using contexts to achieve generality&amp;quot; by Pierre
Bonzon contains a logic programming formalization of a core part of the theory of
contexts. Bonzon&apos;s idea is that Horn clause learning can then be used to learn reasoning
rules that explicitly refer to context. An example is sketched, but there are few details
about the learning algorithm, and apparently no full-scale application of the ideas has
been developed.
&amp;quot;Contextual deontic logic&amp;quot; by Leon W. N. van der Torre and Yao-Hua Tan presents
an explicit representation of contexts as propositions in formalizing statements of con-
ditional obligation, and uses this idea to deploy a solution to the paradoxes of obliga-
tion. This paper makes a genuine contribution to deontic logic, but does not seem to
shed much light on the general theory of context. The solution in this paper would be
more persuasive if the authors could show how it could be used to formalize medium-
scale domains; the idea may suffer from the problem that in practice it may be difficult
to construct the appropriate context for a judgment of obligation.
&amp;quot;A local models semantics for propositional attitudes&amp;quot; by Fausto Giunchiglia and
Chiara Ghidini develops a theme from Fausto Giunchiglia&apos;s previous research (e.g.,
Giunchiglia and Serafini 1994), using a contextual logic to formalize attitudes such
as belief. There is good support for the authors&apos; claim that this type of formalization
is often much more appropriate from the standpoint of implementation. But if an
explicit, general syntactic theory is added to the logic, it becomes inconsistent due to
modifications of the Liar Paradox of the sort provided by Montague (1963). I am not
sure how the authors would deal with these paradoxes.
&amp;quot;Context-based semantics for information integration&amp;quot; by Luciano Serafini and
Chiara Ghidini is perhaps the most successful paper in this volume at relating formal
theory to applications. The authors provide a semantics in the style of Giunchiglia
and Ghidini (1998) for &amp;quot;federated data bases,&amp;quot; which are systems of distributed, au-
tonomous databases subject to fairly loose global constraints. Local models semantics
provide a way to approach this topic without having to construct a single homoge-
neous, complete ontology. The paper contains well-developed, realistic examples. The
challenge would be to integrate the standards of correctness that their specification
provides with algorithms that have the speed and scalability required for database
applications.
&amp;quot;Structured contexts with fibred semantics&amp;quot; by Dov M. Gabbay and Rolf Nossum
is inspired by John McCarthy&apos;s work on contexts, and provides a modal formalization
of the ideas based on labeled deductive systems. There is an axiomatization and a

completeness proof. This formalism provides a good logical foundation for contexts,
for applications in which the meanings of terms do not change from context to context.

The paper would be hard to understand without some familiarity with this material. The wise-men puzzle is not a toy problem, but it would be good to know how to use the framework to deal with more realistic examples. It would be good to know what the advantages are of this approach compared with multimodal theorem598 Book Reviews proving (Gasquet 1995; Stone 1998). The belief-context approach appears to be more flexible, but I am not sure whether the flexibility is needed for the desired applications. &amp;quot;Presuppositions in context: Constructing bridges&amp;quot; by Paul Piwek and Emiel Krahmer deals with bridging anaphora—constructions such as Bill&apos;s car wouldn&apos;t run; the fuel line was clogged. Such constructions are one of the more promising domains for exploring interactions between commonsense knowledge and natural language interpretation. This article combines van der Sandt&apos;s theory of presupposition (van der Sandt 1992) with Constructive Type Theory (Martin-</context>
