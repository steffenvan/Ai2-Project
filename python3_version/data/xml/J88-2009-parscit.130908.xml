are incredibly artificial! As with several other Al sys-
tems, one gets the distinct impression that the data is
fitted to the software! Alshawi is looking for the algo-
rithms that produce the optimal interpretation of a text.
How can he justify these algorithms when he discards
psychology and neurophysiology? What constitutes the
optimal interpretation of a text? These questions are left
unanswered. What remains is the implementation of a
solution to some specific problems considered in a
vacuum. The dissertation presents the advantages and
limitations of a particular solution; several other solu-
tions to these problems have been suggested. Each
author compares his model to the others but the relative
vacuity of it all persists. Suspiciously, all models share
the same basic flaws (e.g., simplistic model of memory,
and absence of mechanisms for the subsequent correc-
tion of an erroneous interpretation). By dissociating
NLP, with its cartesian quest for optimal interpretation
algorithms, from man, his language, his formidable
ability to understand and to misunderstand and to not
understand, computational linguists seem to have cre-
ated the ultimate field of study, one where partial
solutions are taken to intrinsically hold the promise of
an eventual complete and correct solution to the prob-
lem of linguistic understanding. I reject the notion of the
&amp;quot;optimal interpretation&amp;quot; of a text and, after reading
Alshawi&apos;s book, I am left with the bitter taste of an
interesting yet very artificial Lisp program.

Speech processing and computational linguistics have
traditionally been disciplines separated by different
approaches and methodologies. The continuous nature
of speech signals is not easily interfaced to the discrete
units and symbolic processing of linguistic and concep-
tual levels. One of the successful contributions in com-
bining language and speech aspects is MITalk, a speech-
synthesis system developed at MIT to convert English
text to speech signals. The book From text to speech:
The MITalk system is a detailed documentation of the
principles that have resulted from a research effort that
has lasted more than two decades.
The MITalk project has influenced the theory and
practice of speech synthesis to a large extent. Several
commercial synthesizers draw their origin from MITalk
and many research groups around the world have
benefited from its underlying principles, even those
involved in languages as different as Finnish—in the
case of the reviewer. The MITalk synthesizer is re-
garded as a reference point in this field and this system-
atically written book on it is highly welcome.
The writers do not attempt to give a comprehensive
review of different approaches and implementations
available in speech synthesis. (For this, see Klatt 1987.)
Instead, they build their own theoretical framework by
a thorough description of the MITalk implementation
principles. The book is divided into parts in the same
way as the synthesis process of MITalk itself. The
book, as well as the text-to-speech synthesis, starts
from the analysis of the text input. Text pre-processing
is followed by morphological analysis. The extensive
morph lexicon contributes significantly to the high
quality of the synthesis process. A phrase-level parser is
used with rules for morphophonemics and stress modi-
fication. The application of ordered phonological rules
to letter-to-sound conversion and lexical stress con-
cludes the text-analysis part of the text-to-speech proc-
ess.
The synthesis part of MITalk contains a phonological
component, a prosodic component including a funda-
mental frequency generator, a phonetic component (all
the time approaching a continuous-time representa-
tion)—and finally a formant synthesizer (called the
Klatt synthesizer) to produce the continuous speech
signal. The rest of the book discusses some pragmatic
aspects like measures of intelligibility of the synthetic
speech.
This book is primarily of interest to those who are
active in speech research and synthesizer development.
However, especially the first half of the book might
draw remarkable attention from the point of view of
computational linguistics. Most chapters are easy to
read (a possible exception is the formant-synthesizer
section). One weakness of the book is that it took too
many years to publish after the most intensive phases of
the research work. There are also too few ideas to be
found from an artificial-intelligence perspective even
though the rule-based processing in speech synthesis
could be improved by modern knowledge-based meth-
ods. The main message of the book to computational
linguistics is perhaps threefold. First, that a close rela-
tionship to speech processing exists; second, it should

Professor Gunji&apos;s book continues the tradition of explic-
itness in linguistic description so well demonstrated by
Gazdar, Klein, Pullum, and Sag (1985) (GKPS). In
theoretical orientation, too, there is a heavy debt to the
latter. The details, however, show a certain trend
towards the lexicalist position exemplified in theories
such as head-driven phrase-structure grammar (Pollard
and Sag 1987), and categorial unification grammar (Usz-
koreit 1986, Karttunen 1986, Zeevat et al. 1986).
All these theories have been developed with a strong
computational orientation. GKPS could be considered
essential reading for anyone intending or attempting to
develop a serious computational grammar for English,
and Gunji&apos;s Japanese Phrase Structure Grammar
(JPSG) stands in the same relation to Japanese. In fact,
JPSG is used as the basis of the natural-language
component of the Japanese Fifth Generation Computer
project.
The book, a considerably revised version of the
author&apos;s Ohio State M.A. thesis, presents a thorough
and extensive analysis of the central syntactic phenom-
ena of the Japanese language—control in complementa-
tion, reflexive and zero anaphora, unbounded depen-
dencies, and word-order variation.
After a brief introduction, the apparatus to be used in
the analysis is presented. Despite the book&apos;s title, the
phrase-structure rule component is reduced to a single
schematic rule, M —&gt; D H. The burden of constraining
the well-formedness of the local trees licensed by this
rule falls on several principles that govern the distribu-
tion of features in the categories M(other), D(aughter),
and H(ead). These include the head-feature principle
(HFP) and foot-feature principle (FFP), familiar from
GKPS; an adjunct-feature principle, which requires the
value of the ADJUNCT feature of the category D to
unify with the category H; and a SUBCAT feature
principle (SFP), which ensures the satisfaction of lexical
complementation requirements, as in HPSG. SUBCAT
is a feature that takes sets of case-marked categories as
its value, and the SFP states that in complementation,
the value of the mother&apos;s SUBCAT is that of the head
minus the element that unified with the non-head daugh-
ter.
Gunji assumes for most of the book a semantics with
a-reduction of A-calculus expressions as the basic com-
bination operation, and it is this that is explained in the
preliminaries section. However, in the final chapter, on
word order, he suggests that a semantic combination
based on unification is more appropriate for handling a
language with the word-order characteristics of Japa-
nese.
Chapter 3, &amp;quot;Fundamental constructions&amp;quot;, starts with
a detailed argument for the existence of a verb phrase
(VP) in Japanese, and by corollary for the importance of
subject, since VP abbreviates the category
V[SUBCATIPP[SB.M. The rest of the book crucially
exploits the notion of VP. The remainder of Chapter 3
examines the productive processes of causativization,
passivization, and benefactivization. These phenomena
have been the focus of continuing research since Ku-
roda 1965, and have generally been treated by consid-
ering the causative, passive, and benefactive mor-
phemes as verbs taking sentential complements in the
deep structure, with obligatory equi or raising and
predicate raising. In Gunji&apos;s analysis, these morphemes
subcategorize for subject, (possibly dative) object, and
a (crucially) unsaturated verbal constituent. The latter is
either a VP (= V[SUBCAT{PP[SBJ11]), in causatives
and intransitive (adversity) passives, or a TVP (=
V[SUBCATIPP[SBJLPP[OBJ]}]) for the transitive pas-
sive.
Given the unification-based semantics of the final
chapter, the object control is captured simply by iden-
tifying the semantics of the object and the VP or TVP&apos;s
subject in the lexical entries for the bound morphs.
Gunji explicitly declines to give a consistent account of
case marking in simplex sentences and these construc-
tions, thus failing to explain why the causee may not be
marked with accusative case when the embedded verb
is transitive (the latter fact being captured with a feature
co-occurrence restriction.) Neither does he appear to be
worried by the existence of a phrase boundary occur-
ring internally to a word, as in:
