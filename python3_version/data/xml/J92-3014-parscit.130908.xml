Cook&apos;s eye fell on a stack of mail at the
edge of the counter. On top of it was
the latest issue of Linguistic Inquiry.
He smiled—the journal was like an

Highly respected for its
sustained excellence in
qualityof scholarship, Lin-
guistic Inquiry leads the field
in research on current topics
in linguistic theory. Issue
after issue, LI keeps you
informed of new theoretical
developments by presenting
the latest in international
research.
Contributors include some
of the world&apos;s most cel-

Among the topics considered are the computationally symbolic
basis of language, lexicons as repositories of information, auto-
mated text processing, phonology, phototactics, speech synthesis
and the persisting challenge of continuous speech, transforma-
tional grammars and their successors, linguistic and conceptual
approaches to sentence meaning, and discourse coherence and
plan-based bridging inferences. The text also explores such up-to-
the-minute subjects as neurally-inspired computing, parsing and
psychological plausibility, the controversial representation
hypothesis, and the ramifications of discourse &amp;quot;focus.&amp;quot; With its
clear, engaging style and gradual, systematic exposition,
Computers and Human Language makes the fast-moving world of
computational linguistics accessible to the beginning student.

<bodyText confidence="0.697543923076923">
The ACL Series will offer books of high quality in the field of natural
language processing, including human and machine speech production
and understanding. It will cover a wide range of topics, both theoretical
and applied, which should interest researchers not only in computational
linguistics, but also in formal linguistics.
The Series will include specially commissioned volumes, research mono-
graphs, textbooks, and on occasion, collections of high quality papers
with clear unifying themes compiled under the editorship of distinguished
researchers.
The MIT Press publishes the ACL journal, Computational Linguistics. The
Press also has a strong list in formal linguistics and publishes the journal
Linguistic Inquiry.
Submissions for the ACL Series should be directed to one of the Editors,
or to Henry Bradford Stanton at The MIT Press

Membership in the Association for Computational Linguistics is for the calendar year, regardless of when dues are
paid. Membership includes a full year of the ACL journal Computational Linguistics, reduced registration at most
ACL-sponsored conferences, and discounts on ACL-sponsored publications. A late payment fee will be charged for
renewals made after I March; this fee does not apply to new members. Students taking a full-time program of
courses and not earning a regular income qualify for a reduced rate. Institutions now subscribe to the journal
through MIT Press Journals, 55 Hayward Street, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; +1-617-253-2889. Back issues and
proceedings are available only from the ACL Office, except that institutions should backorder journals from 1988 on
through MIT Press. An order form is on the other side of this statement. Payments for dues, back issues, and
proceedings can be made in Europe and Japan as well as the U.S. Most Europeans should pay through Europe;
read the directions under the heading PAYMENT below carefully. Identify your institutional affiliation if it is not
part of your address. Also provide telephone country &amp; city codes and computer network &amp; email address. Write
legibly, please!

MEMBERSHIP DUES FOR 1991: Dues for Regular Members are $25. Couples with the same mailing address
may become Joint Members for $30; they will receive only one set of publications, but each will be eligible for all
other member benefits. Students taking a full-time program of courses and not earning a regular income may
become Student Members for $15 with copy of current student ID. Students who are not Student Members and pay at
the Regular rate can still participate in student activities. Surface mailing costs are included in the membership dues.

<bodyText confidence="0.9835665">
Manuscripts for Computational Linguistics should be submitted on letter-size paper (8.5 by
11 inches, or A4), double-spaced throughout, including footnotes and references. The paper
should begin with an informative abstract of approximately 150-250 words. Manuscripts must
be written in English. Contact the editor regarding the possibility of electronic submission.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.745568">
Submissions may be made in any of the following categories:
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.969633705882353">
Papers: This category includes contributions that report significant new research results in com-
putational linguistics or that provide critical reviews of the literature on a particular topic. The
length of a paper depends on its content, but it is suggested that manuscripts be limited to forty
double-spaced pages. That is the equivalent of thirty journal pages. Each paper is fully refereed,
being read by at least two members of the editorial board and usually by an additional expert
in the particular subject area. The submission of an article to CL for refereeing means that the
author certifies the manuscript is not copyrighted; nor has it been published or submitted for
publication to another refereed journal. If any version of the paper has appeared, or will appear,

Founded in 1962, the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) is the primary scientific and
professional society for natural language processing research and applications. A European chapter was
established in 1982. Besides publishing Computational Linguistics, the ACL holds international meetings
(annually in North America, biennially in Europe) where the state-of-the-art in natural language
processing research and development is presented. It also sponsors a series of books on natural language
processing through The MIT Press. Recently, special interest groups on the Mathematics of Language, the
Lexicon, Parsing, Generation, and Computational Phonology have been formed; others are likely to be
added.
