What are the typical genres on the Web? How
can they be distinguished? What is the cur-
rent application of genre theory to Web tech-
nologies? These are the sort of issues that
would lead you to Genres on the Web, a collec-
tion of essays with a no-nonsense title, edited
by Alexander Mehler, Serge Sharoff, and
Marina Santini. If you understand categoriza-
tion, but need to know something about the
Web and text genres, this book is a pretty
good and accessible starting point.
The individual essay authors are generally
well-respected experts in the field and the
16 individual essays are all solid pieces of
work in their own right. The collection is
well-structured with an introduction by the
volume editors and four sections on, re-
spectively, “Identifying the Sources of Web
Genres,” “Automatic Web Genre Identifica-
tion,” “Structure-Oriented Models of Web
Genres,” and “Case Studies of Web Genres.”
The bulk of the material is in the genre
identification section, and could serve as
the basis for a seminar in text classification
more generally, as it illustrates many of the
major issues and themes in text categoriza-
tion. The target reader is assumed to be famil-
iar with much of the underlying technology;
for example, several authors (Santini, Chap-
ter 5; Kim and Ross, Chapter 6; Sharoff,
Chapter 7; Stein et al., Chapter 8; Braslavski,
Chapter 9) talk about support vector ma-
chines, but none define or describe them. Of
these authors, only Braslavski discusses alter-
natives, and then only in passing. This should
not prove a major barrier. Other sections deal
effectively with issues such as collecting and
normalizing Web samples for genre research,
the relationships between and among genres,
and the evolution of “style” on the Web. Of
particular note is the extensive collection of
figures, diagrams, and tables illustrating the
results of the various analyses, which help
make this a particularly accessible book to
the lay reader.
There are two weaknesses in the collec-
tion. The first is the (lack of) discussion of
the theory of genre itself; there is no clear
definition of what exactly constitutes a “Web
genre” aside from the simple enumeration of
categories listed in benchmark corpora. Of
course, this lack of clarity in the collection is
a consequence of an equivalent lack of clarity
among scholars of genre, as pointed out by
the paper by Rosso and Haas, and this weak-
ness should not be a stumbling block to most
of the readership of Computational Linguistics.
(If anything, it shows where more work on
the theory of genres is needed.)
The second weakness is the relative lack of
discussion of genre in non-text documents.
Aside from one essay (Paolillo, Warren, and
Kunz) on Flash video, there is almost no
attention paid to the multimedia aspects of
Web publishing. This may be a more seri-
ous problem given that many of the papers
describe their technology and applications in
terms of improvements to Web search tech-
nologies, and text Web search is already so
much more advanced than music or video
search that there may be more and better
applications (lower-hanging fruit) available
in other areas.
Despite these relatively minor weaknesses,
the book remains a good reference for the
current state of the art in the study of genre
on the Web, and will be of interest to anyone
trying to sort out a computational notion of
“genre,” on or off the Web.—Patrick Juola,
