We present a new part-of-speech tagger that
demonstrates the following ideas: (i) explicit
use of both preceding and following tag con-
texts via a dependency network representa-
tion, (ii) broad use of lexical features, includ-
ing jointly conditioning on multiple consecu-
tive words, (iii) effective use of priors in con-
ditional loglinear models, and (iv) fine-grained
modeling of unknown word features. Using
these ideas together, the resulting tagger gives
a 97.24% accuracy on the Penn Treebank WSJ,
an error reduction of 4.4% on the best previous
single automatically learned tagging result.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.965880722222222">
Almost all approaches to sequence problems such as part-
of-speech tagging take a unidirectional approach to con-
ditioning inference along the sequence. Regardless of
whether one is using HMMs, maximum entropy condi-
tional sequence models, or other techniques like decision
trees, most systems work in one direction through the
sequence (normally left to right, but occasionally right
to left, e.g., Church (1988)). There are a few excep-
tions, such as Brill’s transformation-based learning (Brill,
1995), but most of the best known and most successful
approaches of recent years have been unidirectional.
Most sequence models can be seen as chaining to-
gether the scores or decisions from successive local mod-
els to form a global model for an entire sequence. Clearly
the identity of a tag is correlated with both past and future
tags’ identities. However, in the unidirectional (causal)
case, only one direction of influence is explicitly consid-
ered at each local point. For example, in a left-to-right
first-order HMM, the current tag t0 is predicted based on
the previous tag t_1 (and the current word).1 The back-
ward interaction between t0 and the next tag t+1 shows
up implicitly later, when t+1 is generated in turn. While
unidirectional models are therefore able to capture both
directions of influence, there are good reasons for sus-
pecting that it would be advantageous to make informa-
tion from both directions explicitly available for condi-
tioning at each local point in the model: (i) because of
smoothing and interactions with other modeled features,
terms like P(t0|t+1, ...) might give a sharp estimate of t0
even when terms like P(t+1|t0, ...) do not, and (ii) jointly
considering the left and right context together might be
especially revealing. In this paper we exploit this idea,
using dependency networks, with a series of local con-
ditional loglinear (aka maximum entropy or multiclass
logistic regression) models as one way of providing ef-
ficient bidirectional inference.
Secondly, while all taggers use lexical information,
and, indeed, it is well-known that lexical probabilities
are much more revealing than tag sequence probabilities
(Charniak et al., 1993), most taggers make quite limited
use of lexical probabilities (compared with, for example,
the bilexical probabilities commonly used in current sta-
tistical parsers). While modern taggers may be more prin-
cipled than the classic CLAWS tagger (Marshall, 1987),
they are in some respects inferior in their use of lexical
information: CLAWS, through its IDIOMTAG module,
categorically captured many important, correct taggings
of frequent idiomatic word sequences. In this work, we
incorporate appropriate multiword feature templates so
that such facts can be learned and used automatically by
1Rather than subscripting all variables with a position index,
we use a hopefully clearer relative notation, where t0 denotes
the current position and t_„ and t+„ are left and right context
tags, and similarly for words.

the model.
Having expressive templates leads to a large number
of features, but we show that by suitable use of a prior
(i.e., regularization) in the conditional loglinear model –
something not used by previous maximum entropy tag-
gers – many such features can be added with an overall
positive effect on the model. Indeed, as for the voted per-
ceptron of Collins (2002), we can get performance gains
by reducing the support threshold for features to be in-
cluded in the model. Combining all these ideas, together
with a few additional handcrafted unknown word fea-
tures, gives us a part-of-speech tagger with a per-position
tag accuracy of 97.24%, and a whole-sentence correct
rate of 56.34% on Penn Treebank WSJ data. This is the
best automatically learned part-of-speech tagging result
known to us, representing an error reduction of 4.4% on
the model presented in Collins (2002), using the same
data splits, and a larger error reduction of 12.1% from the
more similar best previous loglinear model in Toutanova
and Manning (2000).

<bodyText confidence="0.971660333333333">
When building probabilistic models for tag sequences,
we often decompose the global probability of sequences
using a directed graphical model (e.g., an HMM (Brants,
2000) or a conditional Markov model (CMM) (Ratna-
parkhi, 1996)). In such models, the probability assigned
to a tagged sequence of words x = ht, wi is the product
of a sequence of local portions of the graphical model,
one from each time slice. For example, in the left-to-right
CMM shown in figure 1(a),
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.8012345">
�
P(t, w) = i P(ti |ti−1, wi)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999847285714286">
That is, the replicated structure is a local model
P(t0|t−1, w0).2 Of course, if there are too many con-
ditioned quantities, these local models may have to be
estimated in some sophisticated way; it is typical in tag-
ging to populate these models with little maximum en-
tropy models. For example, we might populate a model
for P(t0|t−1, w0) with a maxent model of the form:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.999278333333333">
exp(Xht0,t−1i + Xht0,w0i)
F_
t00 exp(Xht00,t−1i + Xht00,w0i)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999888194444444">
In this case, the w0 and t−1 can have joint effects on t0, but
there are not joint features involving all three variables
(though there could have been such features). We say that
this model uses the feature templates ht0, t−1i (previous
tag features) and ht0, w0i (current word features).
Clearly, both the preceding tag t−1 and following tag
t+1 carry useful information about a current tag t0. Unidi-
rectional models do not ignore this influence; in the case
of a left-to-right CMM, the influence of t−1 on t0 is ex-
plicit in the P(t0|t−1, w0) local model, while the influ-
ence of t+1 on t0 is implicit in the local model at the next
position (via P(t+1|t0, w+1)). The situation is reversed
for the right-to-left CMM in figure 1(b).
From a seat-of-the-pants machine learning perspective,
when building a classifier to label the tag at a certain posi-
tion, the obvious thing to do is to explicitly include in the
local model all predictive features, no matter on which
side of the target position they lie. There are two good
formal reasons to expect that a model explicitly condi-
tioning on both sides at each position, like figure 1(c)
could be advantageous. First, because of smoothing
effects and interaction with other conditioning features
(like the words), left-to-right factors like P(t0|t−1, w0)
do not always suffice when t0 is implicitly needed to de-
termine t−1. For example, consider a case of observation
bias (Klein and Manning, 2002) for a first-order left-to-
right CMM. The word to has only one tag (TO) in the PTB
tag set. The TO tag is often preceded by nouns, but rarely
by modals (MD). In a sequence will to fight, that trend
indicates that will should be a noun rather than a modal
verb. However, that effect is completely lost in a CMM
like (a): P(twill |will, hstarti) prefers the modal tagging,
and P(TO|to, twill) is roughly 1 regardless of twill. While
the model has an arrow between the two tag positions,
that path of influence is severed.3 The same problem ex-
ists in the other direction. If we use the symmetric right-

symbols always exist that we can ignore the differences which
would otherwise exist at the initial and final few positions.
3Despite use of names like “label bias” (Lafferty et al., 2001)
or “observation bias”, these effects are really just unwanted
explaining-away effects (Cowell et al., 1999, 19), where two
nodes which are not actually in causal competition have been
modeled as if they were.

2.1 Semantics of Dependency Networks
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999975">
While the structures in figure 1(a) and (b) are well-
understood graphical models with well-known semantics,
figure 1(c) is not a standard Bayes’ net, precisely because
the graph has cycles. Rather, it is a more general de-
pendency network (Heckerman et al., 2000). Each node
represents a random variable along with a local condi-
tional probability model of that variable, conditioned on
the source variables of all incoming arcs. In this sense,
the semantics are the same as for standard Bayes’ nets.
However, because the graph is cyclic, the net does not
correspond to a proper factorization of a large joint prob-
ability estimate into local conditional factors. Consider
the two-node cases shown in figure 2. Formally, for the
net in (a), we can write P(a, b) = P(a)P(b|a). For (b)
we write P(a, b) = P(b)P(a|b). However, in (c), the
nodes A and B carry the information P(a|b) and P(b|a)
respectively. The chain rule doesn’t allow us to recon-
struct P(a, b) by multiplying these two quantities. Un-
der appropriate conditions, we could reconstruct P(a, b)
from these quantities using Gibbs sampling, and, in gen-
eral, that is the best we can do. However, while recon-
structing the joint probabilities from these local condi-
tional probabilities may be difficult, estimating the local
probabilities themselves is no harder than it is for acyclic
models: we take observations of the local environments
and use any maximum likelihood estimation method we
desire. In our experiments, we used local maxent models,
but if the event space allowed, (smoothed) relative counts
would do.
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.91082775">
4The effect of indirect influence being weaker than direct in-
fluence is more pronounced for conditionally structured models,
but is potentially an issue even with a simple HMM. The prob-
abilistic models for basic left-to-right and right-to-left HMMs
with emissions on their states can be shown to be equivalent us-
ing Bayes’ rule on the transitions, provided start and end sym-
bols are modeled. However, this equivalence is violated in prac-
tice by the addition of smoothing.

2.2 Inference for Linear Dependency Networks
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9993195">
Cyclic or not, we can view the product of local probabil-
ities from a dependency network as a score:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.998016">
�score(x) = i P(xi|Pa(xi))
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9966645625">
where Pa(xi) are the nodes with arcs to the node xi. In the
case of an acyclic model, this score will be the joint prob-
ability of the event x, P(x). In the general case, it will not
be. However, we can still ask for the event, in this case the
tag sequence, with the highest score. For dependency net-
works like those in figure 1, an adaptation of the Viterbi
algorithm can be used to find the maximizing sequence
in polynomial time. Figure 3 gives pseudocode for the
concrete case of the network in figure 1(d); the general
case is similar, and is in fact just a max-plus version of
standard inference algorithms for Bayes’ nets (Cowell et
al., 1999, 97). In essence, there is no difference between
inference on this network and a second-order left-to-right
CMM or HMM. The only difference is that, when the
Markov window is at a position i, rather than receiving
the score for P(ti|ti−1, ti−2, wi), one receives the score
for P(ti−1|ti, ti−2, wi−1).
There are some foundational issues worth mention-
ing. As discussed previously, the maximum scoring se-
quence need not be the sequence with maximum likeli-
hood according to the model. There is therefore a worry
with these models about a kind of “collusion” where the
model locks onto conditionally consistent but jointly un-
likely sequences. Consider the two-node network in fig-
ure 2(c). If we have the following distribution of ob-
servations (in the form ab) h11, 11, 11, 12, 21, 33i, then
clearly the most likely state of the network is 11. How-
ever, the score of 11 is P(a = 1|b = 1)P(b = 1|a = 1)
= 3/4 × 3/4 = 9/16, while the score of 33 is 1. An ad-
ditional related problem is that the training set loss (sum
of negative logarithms of the sequence scores) does not
bound the training set error (0/1 loss on sequences) from

above. Consider the following training set, for the same
network, with each entire data point considered as a label:
(11, 22). The relative-frequency model assigns loss 0 to
both training examples, but cannot do better than 50%
error in regenerating the training data labels. These is-
sues are further discussed in Heckerman et al. (2000).
Preliminary work of ours suggests that practical use of
dependency networks is not in general immune to these
theoretical concerns: a dependency network can choose a
sequence model that is bidirectionally very consistent but
does not match the data very well. However, this problem
does not appear to have prevented the networks from per-
forming well on the tagging problem, probably because
features linking tags and observations are generally much
sharper discriminators than tag sequence features.
It is useful to contrast this framework with the con-
ditional random fields of Lafferty et al. (2001). The
CRF approach uses similar local features, but rather than
chaining together local models, they construct a sin-
gle, globally normalized model. The principal advan-
tage of the dependency network approach is that advan-
tageous bidirectional effects can be obtained without the
extremely expensive global training required for CRFs.
To summarize, we draw a dependency network in
which each node has as neighbors all the other nodes
that we would like to have influence it directly. Each
node’s neighborhood is then considered in isolation and
a local model is trained to maximize the conditional like-
lihood over the training data of that node. At test time,
the sequence with the highest product of local conditional
scores is calculated and returned. We can always find the
exact maximizing sequence, but only in the case of an
acyclic net is it guaranteed to be the maximum likelihood
sequence.

The part of speech tagged data used in our experiments is
the Wall Street Journal data from Penn Treebank III (Mar-
cus et al., 1994). We extracted tagged sentences from the
parse trees.5 We split the data into training, development,
and test sets as in (Collins, 2002). Table 1 lists character-

istics of the three splits.6 Except where indicated for the
model BEST, all results are on the development set.
One innovation in our reporting of results is that we
present whole-sentence accuracy numbers as well as the
traditional per-tag accuracy measure (over all tokens,
even unambiguous ones). This is the quantity that most
sequence models attempt to maximize (and has been mo-
tivated over doing per-state optimization as being more
useful for subsequent linguistic processing: one wants to
find a coherent sentence interpretation). Further, while
some tag errors matter much more than others, to a first
cut getting a single tag wrong in many of the more com-
mon ways (e.g., proper noun vs. common noun; noun vs.
verb) would lead to errors in a subsequent processor such
as an information extraction system or a parser that would
greatly degrade results for the entire sentence. Finally,
the fact that the measure has much more dynamic range
has some appeal when reporting tagging results.
The per-state models in this paper are log-linear mod-
els, building upon the models in (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) and
(Toutanova and Manning, 2000), though some models are
in fact strictly simpler. The features in the models are
defined using templates; there are different templates for
rare words aimed at learning the correct tags for unknown
words.7 We present the results of three classes of experi-
ments: experiments with directionality, experiments with
lexicalization, and experiments with smoothing.

3.1 Experiments with Directionality
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.829327666666667">
In this section, we report experiments using log-linear
CMMs to populate nets with various structures, exploring
the relative value of neighboring words’ tags. Table 2 lists
the discussed networks. All networks have the same ver-
tical feature templates: (t0, w0) features for known words
and various (t0, Q(w1n)) word signature features for all
words, known or not, including spelling and capitaliza-
tion features (see section 3.3).
Just this vertical conditioning gives an accuracy of
93.69% (denoted as “Baseline” in table 2).8 Condition-
6Tagger results are only comparable when tested not only on
the same data and tag set, but with the same amount of training
data. Brants (2000) illustrates very clearly how tagging perfor-
mance increases as training set size grows, largely because the
percentage of unknown words decreases while system perfor-
mance on them increases (they become increasingly restricted
as to word class).
7Except where otherwise stated, a count cutoff of 2 was used
for common word features and 35 for rare word features (tem-
plates need a support set strictly greater in size than the cutoff
before they are included in the model).

next tag instead, is slightly inferior at 95.14%. Model
L+R, using both tags simultaneously (but with only the
individual-direction features) gives a much better accu-
racy of 96.57%. Since this model has roughly twice as
many tag-tag features, the fact that it outperforms the uni-
directional models is not by itself compelling evidence
for using bidirectional networks. However, it also out-
performs model L+L2 which adds the ht0, t−2i second-
previous word features instead of next word features,
which gives only 96.05% (and R+R2 gives 95.25%). We
conclude that, if one wishes to condition on two neigh-
boring nodes (using two sets of 2-tag features), the sym-
metric bidirectional model is superior.
High-performance taggers typically also include joint
three-tag counts in some way, either as tag trigrams
(Brants, 2000) or tag-triple features (Ratnaparkhi, 1996,
Toutanova and Manning, 2000). Models LL, RR, and CR
use only the vertical features and a single set of tag-triple
features: the left tags (t−2, t−1 and t0), right tags (t0, t+1,
t+2), or centered tags (t−1, t0, t+1) respectively. Again,
with roughly equivalent feature sets, the left context is
better than the right, and the centered context is better
than either unidirectional context.

3.2 Lexicalization
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999920121212121">
Lexicalization has been a key factor in the advance of
statistical parsing models, but has been less exploited
for tagging. Words surrounding the current word have
been occasionally used in taggers, such as (Ratnaparkhi,
1996), Brill’s transformation based tagger (Brill, 1995),
and the HMM model of Lee et al. (2000), but neverthe-
less, the only lexicalization consistently included in tag-
ging models is the dependence of the part of speech tag
of a word on the word itself.
In maximum entropy models, joint features which look
at surrounding words and their tags, as well as joint fea-
tures of the current word and surrounding words are in
principle straightforward additions, but have not been in-
corporated into previous models. We have found these
features to be very useful. We explore here lexicaliza-
tion both alone and in combination with preceding and
following tag histories.
Table 3 shows the development set accuracy of several
models with various lexical features. All models use the
same rare word features as the models in Table 2. The
first two rows show a baseline model using the current
word only. The count cutoff for this feature was 0 in the
first model and 2 for the model in the second row. As
there are no tag sequence features in these models, the ac-
curacy drops significantly if a higher cutoff is used (from
a per tag accuracy of about 93.7% to only 60.2%).
The third row shows a model where a tag is de-
cided solely by the three words centered at the tag po-
sition (3W). As far as we are aware, models of this
sort have not been explored previously, but its accu-
racy is surprisingly high: despite having no sequence
model at all, it is more accurate than a model which uses
standard tag fourgram HMM features ((t0, w0), (t0, t−1),
(t0, t−1, t−2), (t0, t−1, t−2, t−3), shown in Table 2, model
L+LL+LLL).
The fourth and fifth rows show models with bi-
directional tagging features. The fourth model
(3W+TAGS) uses the same tag sequence features as
the last model in Table 2 ((t0, t−1), (t0, t−1, t−2),
(t0, t−1, t+1), (t0, t+1), (t0, t+1, t+2)) and current, previ-
ous, and next word. The last model has in ad-
dition the feature templates (t0, w0, t−1), (t0, w0, t+1),
(t0, w−1, w0), and (t0, w0, w+1), and includes the im-
provements in unknown word modeling discussed in sec-
tion 3.3.9 We call this model BEST. BEST has a to-
ken accuracy on the final test set of 97.24% and a sen-
tence accuracy of 56.34% (see Table 4). A 95% confi-
dence interval for the accuracy (using a binomial model)
is (97.15%,97.33%).
In order to understand the gains from using right con-
text tags and more lexicalization, let us look at an exam-
ple of an error that the enriched models learn not to make.
An interesting example of a common tagging error of the
simpler models which could be corrected by a determinis-
tic fixup rule of the kind used in the IDIOMTAG module
of (Marshall, 1987) is the expression as X as (often, as
far as). This should be tagged as/RB X/{RB,JJ} as/IN in
the Penn Treebank. A model using only current word and
two left tags (model L+L2 in Table 2), made 87 errors on
this expression, tagging it as/INX as/IN – since the tag
sequence probabilities do not give strong reasons to dis-
prefer the most common tagging of as (it is tagged as IN
over 80% of the time). However, the model 3W+TAGS,
which uses two right tags and the two surrounding words
in addition, made only 8 errors of this kind, and model
BEST made only 6 errors.

Most of the models presented here use a set of un-
known word features basically inherited from (Ratna-
parkhi, 1996), which include using character n-gram pre-
fixes and suffixes (for n up to 4), and detectors for a few
other prominent features of words, such as capitaliza-
tion, hyphens, and numbers. Doing error analysis on un-
known words on a simple tagging model (with (t0, t−1),
(t0, t−1, t−2), and (w0, t0) features) suggested several ad-

performance. By far the most significant is a crude com-
pany name detector which marks capitalized words fol-
lowed within 3 words by a company name suffix like Co.
or Inc. This suggests that further gains could be made by
incorporating a good named entity recognizer as a prepro-
cessor to the tagger (reversing the most common order of
processing in pipelined systems!), and is a good example
of something that can only be done when using a condi-
tional model. Minor gains come from a few additional
features: an allcaps feature, and a conjunction feature of
words that are capitalized and have a digit and a dash in
them (such words are normally common nouns, such as
CFC-12 or F/A-18). We also found it advantageous to
use prefixes and suffixes of length up to 10. Together
with the larger templates, these features contribute to our
unknown word accuracies being higher than those of pre-
viously reported taggers.

With so many features in the model, overtraining is a dis-
tinct possibility when using pure maximum likelihood es-
timation. We avoid this by using a Gaussian prior (aka
quadratic regularization or quadratic penalization) which
resists high feature weights unless they produce great
score gain. The regularized objective F is:

Since we use a conjugate-gradientprocedure to maximize
the data likelihood, the addition of a penalty term is eas-
ily incorporated. Both the total size of the penalty and
the partial derivatives with repsect to each λj are triv-
ial to compute; these are added to the log-likelihood and
log-likelihood derivatives, and the penalized optimization
procedes without further modification.
We have not extensively experimented with the value
of U2 – which can even be set differently for different pa-
rameters or parameter classes. All the results in this paper
use a constant U2 = 0.5, so that the denominator disap-
pears in the above expression. Experiments on a simple
model with U made an order of magnitude higher or lower
both resulted in worse performance than with U2 = 0.5.
Our experiments show that quadratic regularization
is very effective in improving the generalization perfor-
mance of tagging models, mostly by increasing the num-
ber of features which could usefully be incorporated. The

number of features used in our complex models – in the
several hundreds of thousands, is extremely high in com-
parison with the data set size and the number of features
used in other machine learning domains. We describe two
sets of experiments aimed at comparing models with and
without regularization. One is for a simple model with a
relatively small number of features, and the other is for a
model with a large number of features.
The usefulness of priors in maximum entropy models
is not new to this work: Gaussian prior smoothing is ad-
vocated in Chen and Rosenfeld (2000), and used in all
the stochastic LFG work (Johnson et al., 1999). How-
ever, until recently, its role and importance have not been
widely understood. For example, Zhang and Oles (2001)
attribute the perceived limited success of logistic regres-
sion for text categorization to a lack of use of regular-
ization. At any rate, regularized conditional loglinear
models have not previously been applied to the prob-
lem of producing a high quality part-of-speech tagger:
Ratnaparkhi (1996), Toutanova and Manning (2000), and
Collins (2002) all present unregularized models. Indeed,
the result of Collins (2002) that including low support
features helps a voted perceptron model but harms a max-
imum entropy model is undone once the weights of the
maximum entropy model are regularized.
Table 5 shows results on the development set from two
pairs of experiments. The first pair of models use com-
mon word templates 40, w0), 40, t_1, t_2) and the same
rare word templates as used in the models in table 2. The
second pair of models use the same features as model
BEST with a higher frequency cutoff of 5 for common
word features.
For the first pair of models, the error reduction from
smoothing is 5.3% overall and 20.1% on unknown words.
For the second pair of models, the error reduction is
even bigger: 16.2% overall after convergence and 5.8% if
looking at the best accuracy achieved by the unsmoothed
model (by stopping training after 75 iterations; see be-
low). The especially large reduction in unknown word er-
ror reflects the fact that, because penalties are effectively
stronger for rare features than frequent ones, the presence
of penalties increases the degree to which more general
cross-word signature features (which apply to unknown
words) are used, relative to word-specific sparse features
(which do not apply to unknown words).
Secondly, use of regularization allows us to incorporate
features with low support into the model while improving

performance. Whereas Ratnaparkhi (1996) used feature
support cutoffs and early stopping to stop overfitting of
the model, and Collins (2002) contends that including
low support features harms a maximum entropy model,
our results show that low support features are useful in a
regularized maximum entropy model. Table 6 contrasts
our results with those from Collins (2002). Since the
models are not the same, the exact numbers are incompa-
rable, but the difference in direction is important: in the
regularized model, performance improves with the inclu-
sion of low support features.
Finally, in addition to being significantly more accu-
rate, smoothed models train much faster than unsmoothed
ones, and do not benefit from early stopping. For ex-
ample, the first smoothed model in Table 5 required 80
conjugate gradient iterations to converge (somewhat ar-
bitrarily defined as a maximum difference of 10_4 in fea-
ture weights between iterations), while its corresponding
unsmoothed model required 335 iterations, thus training
was roughly 4 times slower.10 The second pair of models
required 134 and 370 iterations respectively. As might
be expected, unsmoothed models reach their highest gen-
eralization capacity long before convergence and accu-
racy on an unseen test set drops considerably with fur-
ther iterations. This is not the case for smoothed mod-
els, as their test set accuracy increases almost monoton-
ically with training iterations.11 Figure 4 shows a graph
of training iterations versus accuracy for the second pair
of models on the development set.

gests that the final accuracy number presented here could
be slightly improved upon by classifier combination, it is
worth noting that not only is this tagger better than any
previous single tagger, but it also appears to outperform
Brill and Wu (1998), the best-known combination tagger
(they report an accuracy of 97.16% over the same WSJ
data, but using a larger training set, which should favor
them).
While part-of-speech tagging is now a fairly well-worn
road, and our ability to win performance increases in
this domain is starting to be limited by the rate of er-
rors and inconsistencies in the Penn Treebank training
data, this work also has broader implications. Across
the many NLP problems which involve sequence mod-
els over sparse multinomial distributions, it suggests that
feature-rich models with extensive lexicalization, bidirec-
tional inference, and effective regularization will be key
elements in producing state-of-the-art results.

In such models, the probability assigned to a tagged sequence of words x = ht, wi is the product of a sequence of local portions of the graphical model, one from each time slice. For example, in the left-to-right CMM shown in figure 1(a), � P(t, w) = i P(ti |ti−1, wi) That is, the replicated structure is a local model P(t0|t−1, w0).2 Of course, if there are too many conditioned quantities, these local models may have to be estimated in some sophisticated way; it is typical in tagging to populate these models with little maximum entropy</context>

Regardless of whether one is using HMMs, maximum entropy conditional sequence models, or other techniques like decision trees, most systems work in one direction through the sequence (normally left to right, but occasionally right to left, e.g., Church (1988)). There are a few exceptions, such as Brill’s transformation-based learning (Brill, 1995), but most of the best known and most successful approaches of recent years have been unidirectional. Most sequence models can be seen as chaining together the scores or decisions from successive local models to form a global model for an entire sequence. Clearly the identity of a tag is correlated with both past and future tags’ identities. However, in the unidirectional (causal) case, only one direction of influence is explicitly considered at each local point. For example, in a left-to-right first-order HMM, the current tag t0 is predicted based on the previous tag t_1 (and the current word</context>

Again, with roughly equivalent feature sets, the left context is better than the right, and the centered context is better than either unidirectional context. line for this task high, while substantial annotator noise creates an unknown upper bound on the task. 3.2 Lexicalization Lexicalization has been a key factor in the advance of statistical parsing models, but has been less exploited for tagging. Words surrounding the current word have been occasionally used in taggers, such as (Ratnaparkhi, 1996), Brill’s transformation based tagger (Brill, 1995), and the HMM model of Lee et al. (2000), but nevertheless, the only lexicalization consistently included in tagging models is the dependence of the part of speech tag of a word on the word itself. In maximum entropy models, joint features which look at surrounding words and their tags, as well as joint features of the current word and surrounding words are in principle straightforward additions, but have not been incorporated into previous models. We have found these features to be very useful. We explore here lexicalization both alone and in combination with preceding and following tag histo</context>

In this paper we exploit this idea, using dependency networks, with a series of local conditional loglinear (aka maximum entropy or multiclass logistic regression) models as one way of providing efficient bidirectional inference. Secondly, while all taggers use lexical information, and, indeed, it is well-known that lexical probabilities are much more revealing than tag sequence probabilities (Charniak et al., 1993), most taggers make quite limited use of lexical probabilities (compared with, for example, the bilexical probabilities commonly used in current statistical parsers). While modern taggers may be more principled than the classic CLAWS tagger (Marshall, 1987), they are in some respects inferior in their use of lexical information: CLAWS, through its IDIOMTAG module, categorically captured many important, correct taggings of frequent idiomatic word sequences.

Brants (2000) illustrates very clearly how tagging performance increases as training set size grows, largely because the percentage of unknown words decreases while system performance on them increases (they become increasingly restricted as to word class). 7Except where otherwise stated, a count cutoff of 2 was used for common word features and 35 for rare word features (templates need a support set strictly greater in size than the cutoff before they are included in the model). 8Charniak et al. (1993) noted that such a simple model got 90.25%, but this was with no unknown word model beyond a prior distribution over tags. Abney et al.

Having expressive templates leads to a large number of features, but we show that by suitable use of a prior (i.e., regularization) in the conditional loglinear model – something not used by previous maximum entropy taggers – many such features can be added with an overall positive effect on the model. Indeed, as for the voted perceptron of Collins (2002), we can get performance gains by reducing the support threshold for features to be included in the model. Combining all these ideas, together with a few additional handcrafted unknown word features, gives us a part-of-speech tagger with a per-position tag accuracy of 97.24%, and a whole-sentence correct rate of 56.34% on Penn Treebank WSJ data.

We extracted tagged sentences from the parse trees.5 We split the data into training, development, and test sets as in (Collins, 2002).

Table 6 contrasts our results with those from Collins (2002). Since the models are not the same, the exact numbers are incomparable, but the difference in direction is important: in the regularized model, performance improves with the inclusion of low support features.

In the case of an acyclic model, this score will be the joint probability of the event x, P(x). In the general case, it will not be. However, we can still ask for the event, in this case the tag sequence, with the highest score. For dependency networks like those in figure 1, an adaptation of the Viterbi algorithm can be used to find the maximizing sequence in polynomial time. Figure 3 gives pseudocode for the concrete case of the network in figure 1(d); the general case is similar, and is in fact just a max-plus version of standard inference algorithms for Bayes’ nets (Cowell et al., 1999, 97). In essence, there is no difference between inference on this network and a second-order left-to-right CMM or HMM. The only difference is that, when the Markov window is at a position i, rather than receiving the score for P(ti|ti−1, ti−2, wi), one receives the score for P(ti−1|ti, ti−2, wi−1). There are some foundational issues worth mentioning. As discussed previously, the maximum scoring sequence need not be the sequence with maximum likelihood according to the model.

Rather, it is a more general dependency network (Heckerman et al., 2000). Each node represents a random variable along with a local conditional probability model of that variable, conditioned on the source variables of all incoming arcs. In this sense, the semantics are the same as for standard Bayes’ nets. However, because the graph is cyclic, the net does not correspond to a proper factorization of a large joint probability estimate into local conditional factors. Consider the two-node cases shown in figure 2. Formally, for the net in (a), we can write P(a, b) = P(a)P(b|a). For (b) we write P(a, b) = P(b)P(a|b).

The relative-frequency model assigns loss 0 to both training examples, but cannot do better than 50% error in regenerating the training data labels. These issues are further discussed in Heckerman et al. (2000). Preliminary work of ours suggests that practical use of dependency networks is not in general immune to these theoretical concerns: a dependency network can choose a sequence model that is bidirectionally very consistent but does not match the data very well. However, this problem does not appear to have prevented the networks from performing well on the tagging problem, probably because features linking tags and observations are generally much sharper discriminators than tag sequence features.

There are two good formal reasons to expect that a model explicitly conditioning on both sides at each position, like figure 1(c) could be advantageous. First, because of smoothing effects and interaction with other conditioning features (like the words), left-to-right factors like P(t0|t−1, w0) do not always suffice when t0 is implicitly needed to determine t−1. For example, consider a case of observation bias (Klein and Manning, 2002) for a first-order left-toright CMM. The word to has only one tag (TO) in the PTB tag set. The TO tag is often preceded by nouns, but rarely by modals (MD). In a sequence will to fight, that trend indicates that will should be a noun rather than a modal verb. However, that effect is completely lost in a CMM like (a): P(twill |will, hstarti) prefers the modal tagging, and P(TO|to, twill) is roughly 1 regardless of twill.

Preliminary work of ours suggests that practical use of dependency networks is not in general immune to these theoretical concerns: a dependency network can choose a sequence model that is bidirectionally very consistent but does not match the data very well. However, this problem does not appear to have prevented the networks from performing well on the tagging problem, probably because features linking tags and observations are generally much sharper discriminators than tag sequence features. It is useful to contrast this framework with the conditional random fields of Lafferty et al. (2001). The CRF approach uses similar local features, but rather than chaining together local models, they construct a single, globally normalized model. The principal advantage of the dependency network approach is that advantageous bidirectional effects can be obtained without the extremely expensive global training required for CRFs. To summarize, we draw a dependency network in which each node has as neighbors all the other nodes that we would like to have influence it directly. Each node’s neighborhood is then considered in isolation and a local model is trained to maximize the conditional like</context>

Words surrounding the current word have been occasionally used in taggers, such as (Ratnaparkhi, 1996), Brill’s transformation based tagger (Brill, 1995), and the HMM model of Lee et al. (2000), but nevertheless, the only lexicalization consistently included in tagging models is the dependence of the part of speech tag of a word on the word itself. In maximum entropy models, joint features which look at surrounding words and their tags, as well as joint features of the current word and surrounding words are in principle straightforward additions, but have not been incorporated into previous models. We have found these features to be very useful. We explore here lexicalization both alone and in combination with preceding and following tag histories. Table 3 shows the development set </context>

Secondly, while all taggers use lexical information, and, indeed, it is well-known that lexical probabilities are much more revealing than tag sequence probabilities (Charniak et al., 1993), most taggers make quite limited use of lexical probabilities (compared with, for example, the bilexical probabilities commonly used in current statistical parsers). While modern taggers may be more principled than the classic CLAWS tagger (Marshall, 1987), they are in some respects inferior in their use of lexical information: CLAWS, through its IDIOMTAG module, categorically captured many important, correct taggings of frequent idiomatic word sequences. In this work, we incorporate appropriate multiword feature templates so that such facts can be learned and used automatically by 1Rather than subscripting all variables with a position index, we use a hopefully clearer relative notation, where t0 denotes the current position and t_„ and t+„ are left and right context tags, and similarly for words.

In order to understand the gains from using right context tags and more lexicalization, let us look at an example of an error that the enriched models learn not to make. An interesting example of a common tagging error of the simpler models which could be corrected by a deterministic fixup rule of the kind used in the IDIOMTAG module of (Marshall, 1987) is the expression as X as (often, as far as).

In such models, the probability assigned to a tagged sequence of words x = ht, wi is the product of a sequence of local portions of the graphical model, one from each time slice.
