In natural language generation, there is a gap between the stages of &amp;quot;what is to be
said&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;when is it to be said&amp;quot; (text planning), and the stage of &amp;quot;how is it to be said&amp;quot;
(text realization). This gap is due to the fact that the text-planning component usually
chooses units and organizes them without taking into consideration what linguistic
resources are available for expressing them. Expressibility is a requirement on the
initial stages of NLG, the stages that take care of selecting and organizing of what is
to be said. This principle has been clearly defined and paid special attention in Marie
Meteer&apos;s work.
Meteer defines the problem of expressibility, and tackles it by means of text struc-
ture representation in an appropriate way. She looks at text structure from a linguistic
perspective, demonstrating its adequacy for capturing the significant linguistic ab-
stractions necessary for composing linguistic resources, and also at the representation
of text structure in her Spokesman generation system, showing its importance for text
planning. For the first time in generation, she presents a computationally motivated
linguistic level of representation that is more abstract than surface structure and more
concrete than conceptual structures, which have been taken a priori as sources for the
generator.
Meteer&apos;s book Expressibility and the Problem of Efficient Text Planning contains eight
chapters (188 pages), the first of which is introductory and presents the &amp;quot;generation
gap,&amp;quot; whereas the last is concluding, discussing the contributions of the research done
by the author and envisaging future investigations. Chapter 2 is dedicated to terminol-
ogy and issues in text generation, and Chapter 3 discusses motivations from language
and applications focusing on the analysis of revisions. Chapter 4 is essential, and de-
scribes resources of the language and the text structure representation. Chapters 5, 6,
and 7 are dedicated to practical issues and implementation of Meteer&apos;s approach as
well as to alternative architectures.
According to Meteer, in order to exercise the full expressiveness of language, text
planning needs to address the internal composition of clauses and not just their orga-
nization into larger structures. Clauses in actual texts reflect a combination of multiple
atomic units. Systems that ignore this and begin with units that are inevitably realized
have two major deficiencies:

may be simply selected for inclusion in the message and then realized
intact; and
2. they are under-utilizing the power of natural language, which can use
complex noun phrases, nominalizations, adverbial phrases, and other
adjuncts to pack information from multiple units into one clause.
Meteer further claims that in order to plan complex utterances and ensure they
are expressible in language, i.e., can be realized as a grammatical utterance, the text-
planning process must know:

1. what realizations are available to an element—that is, what resources are
available,
2. the constraints on the composition of the resources, and
3. what has been committed to thus far in the utterance, which constrains
the choice of resources.

Meteer&apos;s work provides the theoretical apparatus required to supply this information,
centering on a new representation level, which she calls &amp;quot;text structure.&amp;quot;
It would probably have been a good idea if Meteer had considered also recent
work on text revision outside the U.S.A. (e.g., Japan), which has not been cited in
the references. The chapter &amp;quot;Alternative architectures&amp;quot; could also have been more
complete if architectures intermediary with respect to the traditional two-component
systems and interdependent architectures had also been mentioned.
Meteer enriches the present research of text generation with valuable ideas. Her
investigations on revision in text generation are a solid contribution to the improve-
ment of the quality of the generated text. Meteer&apos;s work is an important milestone
in generation research and it also provides an exciting ground for future research. I
very much recommend reading this book, especially to people interested in natural
language generation.
