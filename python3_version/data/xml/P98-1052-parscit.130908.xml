1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999655540540541">
Our project&apos;s long-range goal (see http://www.isp.
pittedurintgen/) is to create a unified architecture
for collaborative discourse, accommodating both in-
terpretation and generation. Our computational ap-
proach (Thomason and Hobbs, 1997) uses a form
of weighted abduction as the reasoning mechanism
(Hobbs et al., 1993) and modal operators to model
context. In this paper, we describe the corpus study
portion of our project, which is an integral part
of our investigation into recognizing how conversa-
tional participants coordinate agreement. From our
first annotation trials, we found that the recogni-
tion of &amp;quot;classical&amp;quot; speech acts (Austin, 1962; Searle,
1975) by coders is fairly reliable, while recognizing
contextual relationships (e.g., whether an utterance
accepts a proposal) is not as reliable. Thus, we ex-
plore other features that can help us recognize how
participants coordinate agreement.
Our corpus study also provides a preliminary as-
sessment of the Discourse Resource Initiative (DRI)
tagging scheme. The DRI is an international &amp;quot;grass-
roots&amp;quot; effort that seeks to share corpora that have
been tagged with the core features of interest to
the discourse community. In order to use the core
scheme, it is anticipated that each group will need to
refine it for their particular purposes. A usable draft
core scheme is now available for experimentation (see
http://www.georgetown.edu/luperfoy/Discourse-
Treebank/dri-home.html). Whereas several groups
are working with the unadapted core DRI scheme
(Core and Allen, 1997; Poesio and Traum, 1997),
we have attempted to adapt it to our corpus and
particular research questions.
First we describe our corpus, and the issue of
tracking agreement. Next we describe our coding
scheme and our intercoder reliability outcomes. Last
we report our findings ,on tracking agreement.

2 Tracking Agreement
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99935925">
Our corpus consists of 24 computer-mediated
dialogues&apos; in which two participants collaborate on
a simple task of buying furniture for the living and
dining rooms of a house (a variant of the task in
(Walker, 1993)). The participants&apos; main goal is to
negotiate purchases; the items of highest priority are
a sofa for the living room and a table and four chairs
for the dining room. The problem solving task is
complicated by several secondary goals: 1) Match
colors within a room, 2) Buy as much furniture as
you can, 3) Spend all your money. A point system
is used to motivate participants to try to achieve as
many goals as possible. Each subject has a bud-
get and inventory of furniture that lists the quanti-
ties, colors, and prices for each available item. By
sharing this initially private information, the partici-
pants can combine budgets and select furniture from
either&apos;s inventory. The problem is collaborative in
that all decisions have to be consensual; funds are
shared and purchasing decisions are joint.
In this context, we characterize an agreement as
accepting a partner&apos;s suggestion to include a specific
furniture item in the solution. In this paper we will
focus on the issue of recognizing that a suggestion
has been made (i.e. a proposal). The problem is not
easy, since, as speech act theory points out (Austin,
1962; Searle, 1975), surface form is not a clear indi-
cator of speaker intentions. Consider excerpt (1):2

tion and thus cannot count as a proposal to include
it in the solution. The sofa A offers for considera-

of information in [37]—[39].
However, if the dialogue had proceeded as below,
[351 would count as a proposal:

Since context changes the interpretation of [35], our
goal is to adequately characterize the context. For
this, we look for guidance from corpus and domain
features. Our working hypothesis is that for both
participants context is partly determined by the do-
main reasoning situation. Specifically, if the suitable
courses of action are highly limited, this will make
an utterance more likely to be treated as a proposal;
this correlation is supported by our corpus analysis,
as we will discuss in Section 5.

We will present our coding scheme by first describing
the core DRI scheme, followed by the adaptations
for our corpus and research issues. For details about
our scheme, see (Di Eugenio et al., 1997); for details
about features we added to DRI, but that are not
relevant for this paper, see (Di Eugenio et al., 1998).

3.1 The DRI Coding Scheme
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997511333333333">
The aspects of the core DRI scheme that apply to
our corpus are a subset of the dimensions under
Forward- and Backward-Looking Functions.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.924933">
3.1.1 Forward-Looking Functions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.97670605">
This dimension characterizes the potential effect
that an utterance U1 has on the subsequent dialogue,
and roughly corresponds to the classical notion of
an illocutionary act (Austin, 1962; Searle, 1975). As
each Ui may simultaneously achieve multiple effects,
it can be coded for three different aspects: State-
ment, Influence-on-Hearer, Influence-on-Speaker.
Statement. The primary purpose of Statements is
to make claims about the world. Statements are sub-
categorized as an Assert when Speaker S is trying to
change Hearer H&apos;s beliefs, and as a Reassert if the
claim has already been made in the dialogue.
Influence-on-Hearer (I-on-H). A Ui tagged with
this dimension influences H&apos;s future action. DRI dis-
tinguishes between S merely laying out options for
H&apos;s future action (Open-Option), and S trying to get
H to perform a certain action (see Figure 1). Info-
Request includes all actions that request informa-
tion, in both explicit and implicit forms. All other
actions&apos; are Action-Directives.

Influence-on-Speaker (I-on-S). A Ui tagged with
this dimension potentially commits S (in varying de-
grees of strength) to some future course of action.
The only distinction is whether the commitment is
conditional on H&apos;s agreement (Offer) or not (Com-
mit). With an Offer,S indicates willingness to com-
mit to an action if H accepts it. Commits include
promises and other weaker forms.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.940827">
3.1.2 Backward Functions
</subsectionHeader>

This dimension indicates whether U1 is unsolicited,
or responds to a previous U.; or segment.&apos; The tags
of interest for our corpus are:

<listItem confidence="0.99171675">
• Answer: Ui answers a question.
• Agreement:
1. U. Accept/Rejects if it indicates S&apos;s attitude to-

2. U1 Holds if it leaves the decision about the pro-
posal embodied in its antecedent open pending

3.2 Refinements to Core Features

The core DRI manual often does not operationalize
the tests associated with the different dimensions,
such as the two dashed nodes in Figure 1 (the shaded
node is an addition that we discuss below). This
resulted in strong disagreements regarding Forward
Functions (but not Backward Functions) during our
initial trials involving three coders.
Statement. In the current Dill manual, the test
for Statement is whether U1 can be followed by
&amp;quot;That&apos;s not true.&amp;quot;. For our corpus, only syntactic
imperatives or interrogatives were consistently fil-
tered out by this purely semantic test. Thus, we
refined it by appealing to syntax, semantics, and do-
main knowledge: Ui is a Statement if it is declarative

I-on-H and I-on-S. These two dimensions de-
pend on the potential action underlying Ui (see the
root node in Figure 1 for I-on-H). The initial dis-
agreements with respect to these functions were due
to the coders not being able to consistently identify
such actions; thus, we provide a definition for ac-
tions in our domain,5 and heuristics that correlate
types of actions with I-on-H/I-on-S.
We have two types of potential actions: put fur-
niture item X in room Y and remove furniture item
X from room Y. We subcategorize them as specific
and general. A specific action has all necessary pa-
rameters specified (type, price and color of item, and
room). General actions arise because all necessary
parameters are not set, as in I have a blue sofa ut-
tered in a null context.
Heuristic for I-on-H (the shaded node in Fig-
ure 1). If H&apos;s potential action described by Ui is
specific, Ui is tagged as Action-Directive, otherwise
as Open-Option.
Heuristic for I-on-S. Only a Ui that describes S&apos;s
specific actions is tagged with an I-on-S tag.
Finally, it is hard to offer comprehensive guidance
for the test is S trying to get H to do something? in
Figure 1, but some special cases can be isolated. For
instance, when S refers to one action that the partic-
ipants could undertake, but in the same turn makes
it clear the action is not to be performed, then S is
not trying to get H to do something. This happens in
excerpt (1) in Section 2. A specific action (get B&apos;s
$350 yellow sofa) underlies [38], which qualifies as
an Action-Directive just like [35]. However, because
of [40], it is clear that B is not trying to get A to use
B&apos;s sofa. Thus, [38] is tagged as an Open-Option.

In order to investigate our working hypothesis about
the relationship between context and limits on the
courses of action, we coded each utterance for fea-
tures of the problem space. Since we view the prob-
lem space as a set of constraint equations, we decided
to code for the variables in these equations and the
number of possible solutions given all the possible
assignments of values to these variables.

jects of type tin the goal to put an object in a room

the set of equations must have a solution. For exam-
ple, if 5 instances of sofas are known for varsof a, but
every assignment of a value to varsop, violates the
budget constraint, then var,of a and the constraint
equations are unsolvable.
We characterize the solution size for the problem
as determinate if there is one or more solutions and
indeterminate otherwise. It is important to note
that the set of possible values for each vari is not
known at the outset since this information must be
exchanged during the interaction. If S supplies ap-
propriate values for vari but does not know what H
has available for it then we say that no solution is
possible at this time. It is also important to point
out that during a dialogue, the solution size for a set
of constraint equations may revert from determinate
to indeterminate (e.g. when S asks what else H has
available for a van).

4 Analysis of the Coding Results
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999908571428571">
Two coders each coded 482 utterances with the
adapted DRI features (44% of our corpus). Table 1
reports values for the Kappa (K) coefficient of agree-
ment (Carletta, 1996) for Forward and Backward
Functions .6
The columns in the tables read as follows: if utter-
ance Ui has tag X, do coders agree on the subtag?
For example, the possible set of values for I-on-H
are: NIL (Ui is not tagged with this dimension),
Action-Directive, Open-Option, and Info-Request.
The last two columns probe the subtypes of Back-
ward Functions: was Ui tagged as an answer to the
same antecedent? was Ui tagged as accepting, re-
jecting, or holding the same antecedent?&apos;
K factors out chance agreement between coders;
K=0 means agreement is not different from chance,
and K=1 means perfect agreement. To assess the
import of the values 0 &lt; K &lt; 1 beyond K&apos;s sta-
tistical significance (all of our K values are signifi-
cant at p=0.000005), the discourse processing com-
munity uses Krippendorf&apos;s scale (1980)5, which dis-

6For problem solving features, K for two doubly coded
dialogues was &gt; .8. Since reliability was good and time was
short, we used one coder for the remaining dialogues.
71n general, we consider 2 non-identical antecedents as
equivalent if one is a subset of the other, e.g. if one is an
utterance Ui and the other a segment containing Ili.
8More forgiving scales exist but have not yet been dis-
cussed by the discourse processing community, e.g. the one
in (Rietveld and van Hout, 1993).

counts any variable with K &lt; .67, and allows tenta-
tive conclusions when .67 &lt; K &lt; .8 K, and definite
conclusions when K&gt;.8. Using this scale, Table 1
suggests that Forward Functions and Answer can be
recognized far more reliably than Agreement.
To assess the DRI effort, clearly more experiments
are needed. However, we believe our results show
that the goal of an adaptable core coding scheme is
reasonable. We think we achieved good results on
Forward Functions because, as the DRI enterprise
intended, we adapted the high level definitions to
our domain. However, we have not yet done so for
Agreement since our initial trial codings did not re-
veal strong disagreements; now given our K results,
refinement is clearly needed. Another possible con-
tributing factor for the low K on Agreement is that
these tags are much rarer than the Forward Func-
tion tags. The highest possible value for K may be
smaller for low frequency tags (Grove et al., 1981).
Our assessment is supported by comparing our re-
sults to those of Core and Allen (1997) who used the
unadapted DRI manual — see Table 2. Overall, our
Forward Function results are better than theirs (the
non significant K for I-on-S in Table 2 reveals prob-
lems with coding for that tag), while the Backward
Function results are compatible. Finally, our assess-
ment may only hold for task-oriented collaborative
dialogues. One research group tried to use the DRI
core scheme on free-flow conversations, and had to
radically modify it in order to achieve reliable coding
(Stolcke et al., 1998).

5 Tracking Propose and Commit
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.95173926984127">
It appears we have reached an impasse; if human
coders cannot reliably recognize when two partici-
pants achieve agreement, the prospect of automat-
ing this process is grim. Note that this calls into
question analyses of agreements based on a single
coder&apos;s tagging effort, e.g. (Walker, 1996). We think
we can overcome this impasse by exploiting the relia-
bility of Forward Functions. Intuitively, a Ui tagged
as Action-Directive + Offer should correlate with
a proposal — given that all actions in our domain
are joint, an Action-Directive tag always co-occurs
with either Offer (AD+0) or Commit (AD+C). Fur-
ther, analyzing the antecedents of Commits should
shed light on what was treated as a proposal in the
dialogue. Clearly, we cannot just analyze the an-
tecedents of Commit to characterize proposals, as a
proposal may be discarded for an alternative.
To complete our intuitive characterization of a
proposal, we will assume that for a Ui to count as
a well-formed proposal (WFP), the context must be
such that enough information has already been ex-
changed for a decision to be made. The feature so-
lution size represents such a context. Thus our first
testable characterization of a WFP is:
1.1 Ui counts as a WFP if it is tagged as Action-
Directive + Offer and if the associated solution
size is determinate.
To gain some evidence in support of 1.1, we
checked whether the hypothesized WFPs appear as
antecedents of Commits.&apos; Of the 32 AD+Os in Ta-
ble 3, 25 have determinate solution size; thus, WFPs
are the largest class among the antecedents of Com-
mit, even if they only account for 43% of such an-
tecedents. Another indirect source of evidence for
hypothesis 1.1 arises by exploring the following ques-
tions: are there any WFPs that are not committed
to? if yes, how are they dealt with in the dialogue?
If hypothesis 1.1 is correct, then we expect that each
such 1/i should be responded to in some fashion. In
a collaborative setting such as ours, a partner can-
not just ignore a WFP as if it had not occurred.
We found that there are 15 AD+Os with determi-
nate solution size in our data that are not commit-
ted to. On closer inspection, it turns out that 9
out of these 15 are actually indirectly committed to.
Of the remaining 6, four are responded to with a
counterproposal (another AD+0 with determinate
solution size). Thus only two are not responded to
in any fashion. Given that these 2 occur in a di-
alogue where the participants have a distinctively
non-collaborative style, it appears hypothesis 1.1 is
supported.
Going back to the antecedents of Commit (Ta-
ble 3), let&apos;s now consider the 7 indeterminate
AD+Os. They can be considered as tentative pro-
posals that need to be negotiated.&apos;&amp;quot; To further re-
fine our characterization of proposals, we explore the
hypothesis:
9Antecedents of Commits are not tagged. We recon-
structed them from either variable tags or when Ui has both
Commit and Accept tags, the antecedent of the Accept.
19Because of our heuristics of tagging specific actions as
ActionDirectives, these utterances are not Open-Options.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.995858">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.991621">
1.2 When the antecedent of a Commit is an AD+0
and indeterminate, the intervening dialogue
renders the solution size determinate.
In 6 out of the 7 indeterminate antecedent
AD+ Os, our hypothesis is verified (see excerpt (1),
where [35] is an AD+ 0 with indeterminate solution
size, and the antecedent to the Commit in [40]).
As for the other antecedents of Commit in Table 3,
it is not surprising that only 4 Open- Options occur
given the circumstances in which this tag is used (see
Figure 1). These Open-Options appear to function
as tentative proposals like indeterminate AD+ Os, as
the dialogue between the Open- Option and the Com-
mit develops according to hypothesis 1.2. We were
instead surprised that AD+ Cs are a very common
category among the antecedents of Commit (20%);
the second commit appears to simply reconfirm the
commitment expressed by the first (Walker, 1993;
Walker, 1996), and does not appear to count as a
proposal. Finally, the Other column is a collection
of miscellaneous antecedents, such as Info-Requests
and cases where the antecedent is unclear, that need
further analysis. For further details, see (Di Eugenio
et al., 1998).

6 Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999868583333333">
Future work includes, first, further exploring the fac-
tors and hypotheses discussed in Section 5. We char-
acterized WFPs as AD+Os with determinate solu-
tion size: a study of the features of the dialogue pre-
ceding the WFP will highlight how different options
are introduced and negotiated. Second, whereas our
coders were able to reliably identify Forward Func-
tions, we do not expect computers to be able to do so
as reliably, mainly because humans are able to take
into account the full previous context. Thus, we are
interested in finding correlations between Forward
Functions and &amp;quot;simpler&amp;quot; tags.

Our computational approach (Thomason and Hobbs, 1997) uses a form of weighted abduction as the reasoning mechanism (Hobbs et al., 1993) and modal operators to model context. In this paper, we describe the corpus study portion of our project, which is an integral part of our investigation into recognizing how conversational participants coordinate agreement. From our first annotation trials, we found that the recognition of &amp;quot;classical&amp;quot; speech acts (Austin, 1962; Searle, 1975) by coders is fairly reliable, while recognizing contextual relationships (e.g., whether an utterance accepts a proposal) is not as reliable. Thus, we explore other features that can help us recognize how participants coordinate agreement. Our corpus study also provides a preliminary assessment of the Discourse Resource Initiative (DRI) tagging scheme. The DRI is an international &amp;quot;grassroots&amp;quot; effort that seeks to share corpora that have been tagged with the core features of interest to the discourse community. In order to use the core scheme, it is anticipated that each group wi</context>

By sharing this initially private information, the participants can combine budgets and select furniture from either&apos;s inventory. The problem is collaborative in that all decisions have to be consensual; funds are shared and purchasing decisions are joint. In this context, we characterize an agreement as accepting a partner&apos;s suggestion to include a specific furniture item in the solution. In this paper we will focus on the issue of recognizing that a suggestion has been made (i.e. a proposal). The problem is not easy, since, as speech act theory points out (Austin, 1962; Searle, 1975), surface form is not a clear indicator of speaker intentions. Consider excerpt (1):2 (1) A: [35]: i have a blue sofa for 300. [36]: it&apos;s my cheapest one.

As each Ui may simultaneously achieve multiple effects, it can be coded for three different aspects: Statement, Influence-on-Hearer, Influence-on-Speaker. Statement. The primary purpose of Statements is to make claims about the world. Statements are subcategorized as an Assert when Speaker S is trying to change Hearer H&apos;s beliefs, and as a Reassert if the claim has already been made in the dialogue. Influence-on-Hearer (I-on-H). A Ui tagged with this dimension influences H&apos;s future action.

If S supplies appropriate values for vari but does not know what H has available for it then we say that no solution is possible at this time. It is also important to point out that during a dialogue, the solution size for a set of constraint equations may revert from determinate to indeterminate (e.g. when S asks what else H has available for a van). 4 Analysis of the Coding Results Two coders each coded 482 utterances with the adapted DRI features (44% of our corpus). Table 1 reports values for the Kappa (K) coefficient of agreement (Carletta, 1996) for Forward and Backward Functions .6 The columns in the tables read as follows: if utterance Ui has tag X, do coders agree on the subtag? For example, the possible set of values for I-on-H are: NIL (Ui is not tagged with this dimension), Action-Directive, Open-Option, and Info-Request. The last two columns probe the subtypes of Backward Functions: was Ui tagged as an answer to the same antecedent? was Ui tagged as accepting, rejecting, or holding the same antecedent?&apos; K factors out chance agreement between coders; K=0 means agreement is not different from chance, and K=1 means perfect agreem</context>

First we describe our corpus, and the issue of tracking agreement. Next we describe our coding scheme and our intercoder reliability outcomes. Last we report our findings ,on tracking agreement. 2 Tracking Agreement Our corpus consists of 24 computer-mediated dialogues&apos; in which two participants collaborate on a simple task of buying furniture for the living and dining rooms of a house (a variant of the task in (Walker, 1993)). The participants&apos; main goal is to negotiate purchases; the items of highest priority are a sofa for the living room and a table and four chairs for the dining room. The problem solving task is complicated by several secondary goals: 1) Match colors within a room, 2) Buy as much furniture as you can, 3) Spend all your money. A point system is used to motivate participants to try to achieve as many goals as possible. Each subject has a budget and inventory of furniture that lists the quantities, colors, and prices for each available item. By sharing this initially private information, the par</context>

As for the other antecedents of Commit in Table 3, it is not surprising that only 4 Open- Options occur given the circumstances in which this tag is used (see Figure 1). These Open-Options appear to function as tentative proposals like indeterminate AD+ Os, as the dialogue between the Open- Option and the Commit develops according to hypothesis 1.2. We were instead surprised that AD+ Cs are a very common category among the antecedents of Commit (20%); the second commit appears to simply reconfirm the commitment expressed by the first (Walker, 1993; Walker, 1996), and does not appear to count as a proposal. Finally, the Other column is a collection of miscellaneous antecedents, such as Info-Requests and cases where the antecedent is unclear, that need further analysis. For further details, see (Di Eugenio et al., 1998). 6 Future Work Future work includes, first, further exploring the factors and hypotheses discussed in Section 5. We characterized WFPs as AD+Os with determinate solution size: a study of the features of the dialogue preceding the WFP will highlight how different options are introduced and negotiated.

Finally, our assessment may only hold for task-oriented collaborative dialogues. One research group tried to use the DRI core scheme on free-flow conversations, and had to radically modify it in order to achieve reliable coding (Stolcke et al., 1998). 5 Tracking Propose and Commit It appears we have reached an impasse; if human coders cannot reliably recognize when two participants achieve agreement, the prospect of automating this process is grim. Note that this calls into question analyses of agreements based on a single coder&apos;s tagging effort, e.g. (Walker, 1996). We think we can overcome this impasse by exploiting the reliability of Forward Functions. Intuitively, a Ui tagged as Action-Directive + Offer should correlate with a proposal — given that all actions in our domain are joint, an Action-Directive tag always co-occurs with either Offer (AD+0) or Commit (AD+C). Further, analyzing the antecedents of Commits should shed light on what was treated as a proposal in the dialogue. Clearly, we cannot just analyze the antecedents of Commit to characterize proposals, as a proposal may be discarded for an alternative. To complete our intuitive characteriz</context>
