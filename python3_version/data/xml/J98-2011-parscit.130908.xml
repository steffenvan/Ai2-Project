The array of perspectives from which discourse processing is pursued can be mind-
boggling to students of discourse, both new and experienced. We are bombarded with
concepts from various arenas that require sorting out: topic and focus, given and new,
cohesion and coherence; the list goes on. Many questions loom for the computational
linguistics (CL) researcher. What do notions such as topic and focus and given and new
have to say about how discourses are interpreted, as modeled by formal approaches to
coherence resolution? More generally, do works from traditionally functional perspec-
tives contain deep insights, obscured by the lack of formal tools necessary to make
them concrete, or does the articulate yet complex prose in these works obscure a lack
of methodological rigor in their analyses? Is it time to follow other subdisciplines
within CL and eschew theoretical work in favor of purely empirical approaches, or
would such a move be wildly premature? Computational and Conversational Discourse,
an outgrowth of a workshop entitled &amp;quot;Burning Issues in Discourse&amp;quot; held in April
1993 in Maratea, Italy, captures a snapshot of current discourse studies at the breadth
necessary to begin addressing these questions.

1. The Contributions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998307846153846">
The volume consists of seven papers on discourse as approached from four perspec-
tives (sociology, linguistics, computational linguistics, and empirical), all authored by
prominent researchers who are leading, and in many cases pioneering, contributors
to their respective disciplines. As one proceeds, the papers become narrower in their
focus but more precise in their descriptive notation, with the most noticeable gap oc-
curring between the first four papers, which pursue primarily functional analyses, and
the final three, which are computational in nature and more formal.
The first paper, &amp;quot;Issues of relevance for discourse analysis: Contingency in action,
interaction, and co-participant context&amp;quot; by Emanuel A. Schegloff, is the sole contribu-
tion from the perspective of sociology. Schegloff, working within conversation analysis,
argues for the importance of considering the actions performed and accomplishments
made by utterances in a conversation, as opposed to their information content and
truth! He performs a line-by-line analysis of several examples of naturally occurring

dialogue, illustrating the role played by each utterance (and in one case, the lack of
an utterance by a recipient who has been given an opening to contribute one) in the
developing construction of the discourse.
The next three contributions are from the perspective of linguistics, specifically
functional linguistics. James R. Martin&apos;s paper, entitled &amp;quot;Types of structure: Decon-
structing notions of constituency in clause and text,&amp;quot; argues against a constituency
representation for discourse, that is, that &amp;quot;a text is not a tree.&amp;quot; Interestingly, and per-
haps ironically for CL researchers, he pursues his argument by drawing an analogy
with clause structure, here following the Hallidayan use of both constituency and
nonconstituency representations for the latter and suggesting that constituency repre-
sentations cannot capture the principles responsible for constructing textual meaning.
The second contribution, entitled &amp;quot;Interaction and syntax in the structure of conversa-
tional discourse: Collaboration, overlap, and syntactic dissociation&amp;quot; by Tsuyoshi Ono
and Sandra A. Thompson, argues that syntax is intimately involved in the interactional
organization of conversational discourse. Examples are cited in which clauses, and
in one case an unstated proposition, are constructed interactively by multiple partici-
pants, leading to a &amp;quot;dynamic&amp;quot; view of syntax. The final contribution, &amp;quot;The information
structure of the sentence and the coherence of discourse&amp;quot; by Eva Hajicova, argues for
the influence of the topic-focus articulation (TFA) of sentences on discourse interpre-
tation. After giving a brief summary of TFA and related concepts within the Prague
school of functional linguistic description, Hajicova suggests ways in which TFA cor-
relates with changes in the degree of salience of possible antecedents for anaphoric
expressions, illustrating these on a modified article from Time magazine.
There are two papers representing perspectives from computational linguistics,
both addressing issues in discourse coherence recognition. The first paper, &amp;quot;Discourse
coherence and segmentation&amp;quot; by Kathleen Dahlgren, argues that surface indicators
such as cue phrases and shifts in paragraph structure, tense, and focus are insufficient
for recovering discourse structure, and that instead this structure results from recog-
nizing coherence relations explained by &amp;quot;naive theories of causal and other structure
in the world.&amp;quot; Dahlgren progressively develops a theory of coherence, in one case
imposing a shallow notion of discourse structure to maintain a presumed correlation
with locality constraints on pronoun resolution. The second paper, &amp;quot;On the relation be-
tween the informational and intentional perspectives on discourse&amp;quot; by Jerry R. Hobbs,
is a contribution to the ongoing debate between the so-called intentional and informa-
tional approaches to coherence (Moore and Pollack 1992). Hobbs provides an analysis
of a task-oriented dialogue using the &amp;quot;interpretation as abduction&amp;quot; framework (Hobbs
et al. 1993), in which the establishment of informational coherence is seen as a subpart
of the establishment of intentional coherence. The introduction contains an eloquent
defense of the informational approach for those interested in this debate.
The final paper, &amp;quot;Empirical analysis of three dimensions of spoken discourse: Seg-
mentation, coherence, and linguistic devices,&amp;quot; by Rebecca J. Passonneau and Diane J.
Litman (henceforth P&amp;L), is the sole contribution from the empirical perspective. P&amp;L
describe experiments in which naive subjects performed &amp;quot;flat&amp;quot; discourse segmenta-
tions on spoken narratives from the Pear Stories corpus (Chafe 1980), and compare
several implementations for recognizing those boundaries that the subjects tended to
agree upon. The procedures are not fully automatic, however, in that some of the
indicators are hand-coded, including the identification of NPs (including pronouns
and even empty pronouns, see their Figure 6), their antecedents, and other inferential
relations.

2. The Collection
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998719217391304">
I found most of the papers to be as accessible and self-contained as can be expected,
with the exception of Martin&apos;s paper, which will not be easily comprehended by any-
one unfamiliar with Hallidayan linguistics. Despite their outgrowth from a common
workshop, however, there is little evidence of cross-fertilization between the papers.
Schegloff perhaps makes the best attempt to address researchers outside of his field,
especially in an interesting postscript in which he responds to a referee coming from
an experimental or computational standpoint. Responding to a request to graft his
work into a more formal format, he invites CL researchers to &amp;quot;seriously pursu[e] [his
field] in its own terms, trying to understand why researchers proceed as they do in
this area,&amp;quot; concluding that &amp;quot;successful convergence here is, after all, a long shot.&amp;quot;
Despite the lack of cross-fertilization, there are places in which statements in one
paper raise issues manifest in others, adding to the appeal of collocating these papers
within the volume. For instance, in his postscript, Schegloff responds to the following
comment from his referee:
My concern is that someone else could come along and offer a very different
interpretation of a conversation.... If so, how would we know which
interpretation to choose? Do we just rely on the intuitions of native
conversationalists, or can we put this kind of hypothesis to a more stringent test?
In short, I&apos;d like to see the insights that he has gained about what seem to be
regularities in how conversations are managed firmed up into much more
specific statements that would be objectively testable. (p. 24)
Schegloff notes that he offers his analyses not as a native conversationalist but as an
informed, technical analyst, and then responds:
Curiously, it is those experimentally inclined investigators who wish to put
interactional materials before naive judges and treat their reactions seriously ...
who seem to me to wish to &amp;quot;just rely on the intuitions of native
conversationalists.&amp;quot; Indeed, I submit that the accounts offered above have been
put &amp;quot;to a more stringent test,&amp;quot; and have been &amp;quot;firmed up into much more
specific statements that [have been] objectively test[ed].&amp;quot; (p. 26)
This response illustrates a tension that exists between P&amp;L&apos;s empirical work and the-
oretical work on discourse structure. The flat segmentation used by P&amp;L, in contrast
to approaches positing full hierarchical tree structure (Grosz and Sidner 1986; Polanyi
1988), and in stark contrast to the papers by Martin, Dahlgren, and Hobbs, all of
whom argue that even a (surface contiguous) tree structure is sometimes insufficient,
is a concession to their choice to use naive subjects to mark the segment boundaries.
As Schegloff might say, P&amp;L put &amp;quot;materials before naive judges and treat[ed] their
reactions seriously,&amp;quot; a decision that could be questioned, especially when consider-
ing some of the examples P&amp;L provide. For instance, to give an analogy with clause
structure, would one be interested in predicting syntactic trees as drawn by subjects
with no training in syntax, rather than, say, by initiated researchers striving for some
degree of theory neutrality (cf. Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz [1993, p. 321]),
especially if the use of such subjects necessitated that they limit the depth of their
trees to one?
Likewise, an interesting contrast occurs between P&amp;L and Dahlgren&apos;s contribution.
On one hand, without referencing P&amp;L, Dahlgren argues that the types of indicators
P&amp;L use to recover discourse structure are highly inadequate. On the other hand,

without referencing Dahlgren, P&amp;L address a potential concern with Dahlgren&apos;s ap-
proach:
... if segments are taken to be an independent construct [as opposed to
definitional] that correlate directly with the focus of attention ... or the
speaker&apos;s specific rhetorical purposes ... , the definition of segment must be
formulated independently of the distribution of linguistic devices. (p. 167)
Dahlgren in fact does not formulate her notion of discourse structure independently,
instead directly incorporating factors identified in two corpus studies (e.g., pronominal
reference behavior) into her proposal. Dahlgren then concludes:
This theory predicts that change of discourse relation results in change of
segment, one of the main findings in our Study 1. The approach proposed here
predicts the availability of antecedents for anaphors by... the constraints of the
discourse segment structure. (p. 134, italics added)
In actuality, Dahlgren&apos;s definitions were based specifically on these very findings and
thus cannot be said to &amp;quot;predict&amp;quot; them. This is what experimentalists would call testing
on one&apos;s training data, an unfortunately common occurrence in linguistics.

3. Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999936055555556">
Readers having suffered through this review thus far are undoubtedly ready to hear
whether they should invest their money in purchasing the book, or alternatively
whether to recommend it to their librarian and invest their (undoubtedly copious) free
time reading it. The answers depend on what return one expects from the investment.
To recommend it, the book offers a collection of representative papers from an im-
pressively varied array of approaches to discourse, authored by an equally impressive
set of researchers who have pioneered those very approaches. The book thus provides
&amp;quot;one-stop shopping&amp;quot; for researchers looking for an up-to-date sampling of discourse
research from a broad view. Also, each paper comes with an extensive bibliography
suitable for pursuing the literature in any of these areas to greater depth.
I find the book to be a reasonable first step toward a more challenging goal that
is nonetheless not reached here, that is, real progress in cross-fertilizing approaches
to discourse, especially ones that span the implicit barrier between the functional and
computational approaches. The reader who is already familiar with work in these
disciplines, and now seeks answers to nagging questions regarding cross-fertilization,
will not find them here. However, merely having these papers collocated, and the
comparisons one makes when reading them together, might serve to inspire ideas that
would not have otherwise come to mind.

The second paper, &amp;quot;On the relation between the informational and intentional perspectives on discourse&amp;quot; by Jerry R. Hobbs, is a contribution to the ongoing debate between the so-called intentional and informational approaches to coherence (Moore and Pollack 1992). Hobbs provides an analysis of a task-oriented dialogue using the &amp;quot;interpretation as abduction&amp;quot; framework (Hobbs et al. 1993), in which the establishment of informational coherence is seen as a subpart of the establishment of intentional coherence. The introduction contains an eloquent defense of the informational approach for those interested in this debate. The final paper, &amp;quot;Empirical analysis of three dimensions of spoken discourse: Segmentation, coherence, and linguistic devices,&amp;quot; by Rebecca J. Passonneau and Diane J. Litman (henceforth P&amp;L), is the sole contribution from the empirical pe</context>

The flat segmentation used by P&amp;L, in contrast to approaches positing full hierarchical tree structure (Grosz and Sidner 1986; Polanyi 1988), and in stark contrast to the papers by Martin, Dahlgren, and Hobbs, all of whom argue that even a (surface contiguous) tree structure is sometimes insufficient, is a concession to their choice to use naive subjects to mark the segment boundaries. As Schegloff might say, P&amp;L put &amp;quot;materials before naive judges and treat[ed] their reactions seriously,&amp;quot; a decision that could be questioned, especially when considering some of the examples P&amp;L provide. For instance, to give an analogy with clause structure, would one be interested in predicting syntactic trees as drawn by subjects with no training</context>
