Interpreting news requires identifying its con-
stituent events. Events are complex linguis-
tically and ontologically, so disambiguating
their reference is challenging. We introduce
event linking, which canonically labels an
event reference with the article where it was
first reported. This implicitly relaxes corefer-
ence to co-reporting, and will practically en-
able augmenting news archives with semantic
hyperlinks. We annotate and analyse a corpus
of 150 documents, extracting 501 links to a
news archive with reasonable inter-annotator
agreement.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992833759259259">
Interpreting news requires identifying its constituent
events. Information extraction (IE) makes this feasi-
ble by considering only events of a specified type,
such as personnel succession or arrest (Grishman
and Sundheim, 1996; LDC, 2005), an approach not
extensible to novel events, or the same event types
in sub-domains, e.g. sport. On the other hand, topic
detection and tracking (TDT; Allan, 2002) disregards
individual event mentions, clustering together arti-
cles that share a topic.
Between these fine and coarse-grained ap-
proaches, event identification requires grouping ref-
erences to the same event. However, strict corefer-
ence is hampered by the complexity of event seman-
tics: poison, murder and die may indicate the same
effective event. The solution is to tag mentions with
a canonical identifier for each news-triggering event.
This paper introduces event linking: given a past
event reference in context, find the article in a news
archive that first reports that the event happened.
The task has an immediate practical application:
some online newspapers link past event mentions to
relevant news stories, but currently do so with low
coverage and consistency; an event linker can add
referentially-precise hyperlinks to news.
The event linking task parallels entity link-
ing (NEL; Ji and Grishman, 2011), considering a
news archive as a knowledge base (KB) of events,
where each article exclusively represents the zero or
more events that it first reports. Coupled with an ap-
propriate event extractor, event linking may be per-
formed for all events mentioned in a document, like
the named entity disambiguation task (Bunescu and
Pa¸sca, 2006; Cucerzan, 2007).
We have annotated and analysed 150 news and
opinion articles, marking references to past, news-
worthy events, and linking where possible to canon-
ical articles in a 13-year news archive.
2 The events in a news story
Approaches to news event processing are subsumed
within broader notions of topics, scenario templates,
or temporal entities, among others. We illustrate key
challenges in processing news events and motivate
event linking through the example story in Figure 1.
Salience Our story highlights carjackings and a
police warning as newsworthy, alongside events like
feeding, drove and told which carry less individual
weight. Orthogonally, parts of the story are new
events, while others are previously reported events
that the reader may be aware of (illustrated in Fig-
ure 1). Online, the two background carjackings and
the police warning are hyperlinked to other SMH arti-
cles where they were reported. Event schemas tend
not to directly address salience: MUC-style IE (Gr-

<bodyText confidence="0.9940111875">
There has been another carjacking in Sydney,
B two weeks after two people were stabbed in their cars in
separate incidents.
N A 32-year-old driver was walking to his station wagon on
Hickson Road, Millers Point, after feeding his parking me-
ter about 4.30pm yesterday when a man armed with a
knife grabbed him and told him to hand over his car keys
and mobile phone, police said. The carjacker then drove
the black 2008 Holden Commodore... He was described
as a 175-centimetre-tall Caucasian...
B Police warned Sydney drivers to keep their car doors
locked after two stabbings this month. On September 4,
a 40-year-old man was stabbed when three men tried to
steal his car on Rawson Street, Auburn, about 1.20am.
The next day, a 25-year-old woman was stabbed in her
lower back as she got into her car on Liverpool Road...

ishman and Sundheim, 1996) selects an event type
of which all instances are salient; TDT (Allan, 2002)
operates at the document level, which avoids differ-
entiating event mentions; and TimeML (Pustejovsky
et al., 2003) marks the main event in each sentence.
Critiquing ACE05 event detection for not addressing
salience, Ji et al. (2009) harness cross-document fre-
quencies for event ranking. Similarly, reference to a
previously-reported event implies it is newsworthy.
Diversity IE traditionally targets a selected event
type (Grishman and Sundheim, 1996). ACE05 con-
siders a broader event typology, dividing eight
thematic event types (business, justice, etc.) into
33 subtypes such as attack, die and declare
bankruptcy (LDC, 2005). Most subtypes suffer from
few annotated instances, while others are impracti-
cally broad: sexual abuse, gunfire and the Holocaust
each constitute attack instances (is told considered
an attack in Figure 1?). Inter-annotator agreement
is low for most types.1 While ACE05 would mark
the various attack events in our story, police warned
would be unrecognised. Despite template adapta-
tion (Yangarber et al., 2000; Filatova et al., 2006;
Li et al., 2010; Chambers and Jurafsky, 2011), event
types are brittle to particular tasks and domains, such
as bio-text mining (e.g. Kim et al., 2009); they can-
not reasonably handle novel events.
1For binary sentence classification, we calculate an inter-
quartile range of r. E [0.46, 0.64] over the 33 sub-types. Coarse
event type classification ranges from r. = 0.47 for business to
r. = 0.69 for conflict.
Identity Event coreference is complicated by par-
titive (sub-event) and logical (e.g. causation) re-
lationships between events, in addition to lexical-
semantic and syntactic issues. When consider-
ing the relationship between another carjacking and
grabbed, drove or stabbed, ACE05 would apply the
policy: “When in doubt, do not mark any corefer-
ence” (LDC, 2005). Bejan and Harabagiu (2008)
consider event coreference across documents, mark-
ing the “most important events” (Bejan, 2010), al-
beit within Google News clusters, where multiple
articles reporting the same event are likely to use
similar language. Similar challenges apply to iden-
tifying event causality and other relations: Bejan
and Harabagiu (2008) suggest arcs such as feeding
precedes �����walking enables ����grabbed – akin to instantia-
tions of FrameNet’s frame relations (Fillmore et al.,
2003). However, these too are semantically subtle.
Explicit reference By considering events through
topical document clusters, TDT avoids some chal-
lenges of precise identity. It prescribes rules of in-
terpretation for which stories pertain to a seminal
event. However, the carjackings in our story are
neither preconditions nor consequences of a semi-
nal event and so would not constitute a TDT clus-
ter. TDT fails to account for these explicit event ref-
erences. Though Feng and Allan (2009) and Yang
et al. (2009) consider event dependency as directed
arcs between documents or paragraphs, they gener-
ally retain a broad sense of topic with little attention
to explicit reference.

3 The event linking task
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999615">
Given an explicit reference to a past event, event
linking grounds it in a given news archive. This ap-
plies to all events worthy of having been reported,
and harnesses explicit reference rather than more
general notions of relevance. Though analogous to
NEL, our task differs in the types of expressions that
may be linked, and the manner of determining the
correct KB node to link to, if any.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.991016">
3.1 Event-referring expressions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98493375">
We consider a subset of newsworthy events – things
that happen and directly trigger news – as candidate
referents. In TimeML’s event classification (Puste-
jovsky et al., 2003), newsworthy events would gen-
</bodyText>

erally be occurrence (e.g. die, build, sell) or aspec-
tual (e.g. begin, discontinue), as opposed to percep-
tion (e.g. hear), intentional state (e.g. believe), etc.
Still, we are not confined to these types when other
classes of event are newsworthy. All references must
be explicit, reporting the event as factual and com-
pleted or ongoing.
Not all event references meeting these criteria are
reasonably LINKABLE to a single article:
MULTIPLE many distinct events, or an event type,
e.g. world wars, demand;
AGGREGATE emerges from other events over time,
e.g. grew 15%, scored 100 goals;
COMPLEX an event reported over multiple articles
in terms of its sub-events, e.g. 2012 election,
World Cup, scandal.

3.2 A news archive as a KB
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9995957">
We define a canonical link target for each event: the
earliest article in the archive that reports the given
event happened or is happening. Each archival arti-
cle implicitly represents zero or more related events,
just as Wikipedia entries represent zero or one entity
in NEL. Links target the story as a whole: closely
related, co-reported events link to the same article,
avoiding a problematically strict approach to event
identity. An archive reports only selected events, so
a valid target may not exist (NEL’s NIL).

We link to a digital archive of the Sydney Morn-

We annotate a randomly sampled corpus of 150 arti-
cles from its 2009 News and Features and Business
sections including news reports, op-eds and letters.
For this whole-document annotation, a single
word of each past/ongoing, newsworthy event men-
tion is marked.3 If LINKABLE, the annotator
searches the archive by keyword and date, selecting
a target, reported here (a self-referential link) or NIL.
An annotation of our example story (Figure 1) would
produce five groups of event references (Table 1).

All documents were annotated by external anno-
tator A; external annotators B and C annotated 72
and 24 respectively; and all were adjudicated by the
first author (J). Pairwise inter-annotator agreement
in Table 2 shows that annotators infrequently select
the same words to link, but that reasonable agree-
ment on the link target can be achieved for agreed
tokens.4 Adjudicator-annotator agreements are gen-
erally much higher than inter-annotator agreements:
in many cases, an annotator fails to find a target
or selects one that does not first report the event;
J accepts most annotations as valid. In other cases,
there may be multiple articles published on the same
day that describe the event in question from differ-
ent angles; agreement increases substantially when
relaxed to accept date agreement. Our adjudicated
corpus of 150 documents is summarised in Table 3.
Where a definitive link target is not available, an
annotator may erroneously select another candidate:
an opinion article describing the event, an article
where the event is mentioned as background, or an
article anticipating the event.
The task is complicated by changed perspective
between an event’s first report and its later reference.

10 died be linked to an article where only nine are
confirmed dead? For the application of adding hy-
perlinks to news, such a link might be beneficial, but
it may be better considered an AGGREGATE.
The schema underspecifies definitions of ‘event’
and ‘newsworthiness’, accounting for much of the
token-level disagreement, but not directly affecting
the task of linking a specified mention to the archive.
Adjectival mentions such as Apple’s new CEO are
easy to miss and questionably explicit. Events are
also confused with facts and abstract entities, such
as bans, plans, reports and laws. Unlike many other
facts, events can be grounded to a particular time of
occurrence, often stated in text.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998122625">
To assess task feasibility, we present bag-of-words
(BoW) and oracle results (Figure 2). Using the whole
document as a query5 retrieves 30% of gold targets
at rank 10, but only 60% by rank 150. Term win-
dows around each event mention perform close to
our oracle consisting of successful search keywords
collected during annotation, with over 80% recall at
150. No system recalls over 30% of targets at 1-best,
suggesting a reranking approach may be required.
Constraining search result dates is essential; an-
notators’ constraints improve recall by 20% at rank
50. These constraints may draw on temporal expres-
sions in the source article or external knowledge.
Successful automated linking will therefore require
extensive use of semantic and temporal information.

Yang et al. (2009) makes the reasonable assumption
that news events generally build on others that re-
cently precede them. We find that the likelihood
a linked article occurred fewer than d days ago re-
duces exponentially with respect to d, yet the rate
of decay is surprisingly slow: half of all link targets
precede their source by over 3 months.
The effect of coreporting rather than coreference
is also clear: like {carjacking, grabbed} in our ex-
ample, mention chains include {return, decide, re-
contest}, {winner, Cup} as well as more familiar in-
stances like {acquired, acquisition}.

6 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999988">
We have introduced event linking, which takes a
novel approach to news event reference, associating
each newsworthy past event with a canonical arti-
cle in a news archive. We demonstrate task’s fea-
sibility, with reasonable inter-annotator agreement
over a 150 document corpus. The corpus highlights
features of the retrieval task and its dependence on
temporal knowledge. As well as using event link-
ing to add referentially precise hyperlinks to a news
archive, further characteristics of news will emerge
by analysing the graph of event references.

We introduce event linking, which canonically labels an event reference with the article where it was first reported. This implicitly relaxes coreference to co-reporting, and will practically enable augmenting news archives with semantic hyperlinks. We annotate and analyse a corpus of 150 documents, extracting 501 links to a news archive with reasonable inter-annotator agreement. 1 Introduction Interpreting news requires identifying its constituent events. Information extraction (IE) makes this feasible by considering only events of a specified type, such as personnel succession or arrest (Grishman and Sundheim, 1996; LDC, 2005), an approach not extensible to novel events, or the same event types in sub-domains, e.g. sport. On the other hand, topic detection and tracking (TDT; Allan, 2002) disregards individual event mentions, clustering together articles that share a topic. Between these fine and coarse-grained approaches, event identification requires grouping references to the same event. However, strict coreference is hampered by the complexity of event semantics: poison, murder and die may indicate the same effective event.

Critiquing ACE05 event detection for not addressing salience, Ji et al. (2009) harness cross-document frequencies for event ranking. Similarly, reference to a previously-reported event implies it is newsworthy. Diversity IE traditionally targets a selected event type (Grishman and Sundheim, 1996).

Though analogous to NEL, our task differs in the types of expressions that may be linked, and the manner of determining the correct KB node to link to, if any. 3.1 Event-referring expressions We consider a subset of newsworthy events – things that happen and directly trigger news – as candidate referents. In TimeML’s event classification (Pustejovsky et al., 2003), newsworthy events would gen229 erally be occurrence (e.g. die, build, sell) or aspectual (e.g. begin, discontinue), as opposed to perception (e.g. hear), intentional state (e.g. believe), etc. Still, we are not confined to these types when other classes of event are newsworthy. All references must be explicit, reporting the event as factual and completed or ongoing. Not all event references meeting these criteria are reasonably LINKABLE to a single article: MULTIPLE many distinct events, or an event type, e.g. world wars, demand; AGGREGATE emerges from other events over time, e.g. grew 15%, </context>

However, these too are semantically subtle. Explicit reference By considering events through topical document clusters, TDT avoids some challenges of precise identity. It prescribes rules of interpretation for which stories pertain to a seminal event. However, the carjackings in our story are neither preconditions nor consequences of a seminal event and so would not constitute a TDT cluster. TDT fails to account for these explicit event references. Though Feng and Allan (2009) and Yang et al. (2009) consider event dependency as directed arcs between documents or paragraphs, they generally retain a broad sense of topic with little attention to explicit reference. 3 The event linking task Given an explicit reference to a past event, event linking grounds it in a given news archive.

Constraining search result dates is essential; annotators’ constraints improve recall by 20% at rank 50. These constraints may draw on temporal expressions in the source article or external knowledge. Successful automated linking will therefore require extensive use of semantic and temporal information. Our corpus also highlights distinctions between 5Using Apache Solr defaults: TFIDF-weighted cosine similarity over stemmed and stopped tokens. Figure 2: Recall for BoW and oracle systems explicit event reference and broader relationships. Yang et al. (2009) makes the reasonable assumption that news events generally build on others that recently precede them. We find that the likelihood a linked article occurred fewer than d days ago reduces exponentially with respect to d, yet the rate of decay is surprisingly slow: half of all link targets precede their source by over 3 months. The effect of coreporting rather than coreference is also clear: like {carjacking, grabbed} in our example, mention chains include {return, decide, recontest}, {winner, Cup} as well as more familiar instances like {acquired, acquisition}. 6 Conclusion We have introduced </context>

ACE05 considers a broader event typology, dividing eight thematic event types (business, justice, etc.) into 33 subtypes such as attack, die and declare bankruptcy (LDC, 2005). Most subtypes suffer from few annotated instances, while others are impractically broad: sexual abuse, gunfire and the Holocaust each constitute attack instances (is told considered an attack in Figure 1?). Inter-annotator agreement is low for most types.1 While ACE05 would mark the various attack events in our story, police warned would be unrecognised. Despite template adaptation (Yangarber et al., 2000; Filatova et al., 2006; Li et al., 2010; Chambers and Jurafsky, 2011), event types are brittle to particular tasks and domains, such as bio-text mining (e.g. Kim et al., 2009); they cannot reasonably handle novel events. 1For binary sentence classification, we calculate an interquartile range of r. E [0.46, 0.64] over the 33 sub-types. Coarse event type classification ranges from r. = 0.47 for business to r. = 0.69 for conflict.
