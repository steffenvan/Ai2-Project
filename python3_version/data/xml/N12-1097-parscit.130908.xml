Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999137176470588">
A U.S. Congressional bill is a textual artifact
that must pass through a series of hurdles to
become a law. In this paper, we focus on one
of the most precarious and least understood
stages in a bill’s life: its consideration, behind
closed doors, by a Congressional committee.
We construct predictive models of whether a
bill will survive committee, starting with a
strong, novel baseline that uses features of the
bill’s sponsor and the committee it is referred
to. We augment the model with information
from the contents of bills, comparing different
hypotheses about how a committee decides a
bill’s fate. These models give significant re-
ductions in prediction error and highlight the
importance of bill substance in explanations of
policy-making and agenda-setting.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999985553191489">
In representative governments, laws result from a
complex social process. Central to that process is
language. Text data emerging from the process in-
clude debates among legislators (Laver et al., 2003;
Quinn et al., 2010; Beigman Klebanov et al., 2008),
press releases (Grimmer, 2010), accounts of these
debates in the press, policy proposals, and laws.
In the work reported here, we seek to exploit text
data—specifically, the text of Congressional bills—
to understand the lawmaking process. We consider
an especially murky part of that process that is dif-
ficult to study because it happens largely behind
closed doors: the handling of bills by Congressional
committees. This early stage of a bill’s life is precar-
ious: roughly 85% of bills do not survive commit-
tee. By contrast, nearly 90% of bills that are recom-
mended by a committee (i.e., survive the committee
and are introduced for debate on the floor) will sur-
vive a roll call vote by the legislature. Because fil-
tering by these powerful Congressional committees
is both more opaque and more selective than the ac-
tions of the legislature as a whole, we believe that
text-based models can play a central role in under-
standing this stage of lawmaking.
This paper’s contributions are: (i) We formu-
late computationally the prediction of which bills
will a survive Congressional committee, presenting
a (baseline) model based on observable features as-
sociated with a bill, the committee(s) it is assigned
to, members of that committee, the Congress as a
whole, and expert combinations of those features.
The task formulation and baseline model are novel.
(ii) We propose several extensions of that strong
baseline with information derived from the text of
a bill. (iii) We validate our models on a hard predic-
tive task: predicting which bills will survive com-
mittee. Text is shown to be highly beneficial. (iv)
We present a discussion of the predictive features se-
lected by our model and what they suggest about the
underlying political process. (v) We release our cor-
pus of over 50,000 bills and associated metadata to
the research community for further study.1
We give brief background on how bills become
U.S. laws in §2. We describe our data in §3. The
modeling framework and baseline are then intro-
duced (§4), followed by our text-based models with
experiments (§5), then further discussion (§6).

2 How Bills Become Laws
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999722">
In the U.S., federal laws are passed by the
U.S. Congress, which consists of two “chambers,”
the House of Representatives (commonly called the
“House”) and the Senate. To become law, a bill (i.e.,
a proposed law) must pass a vote in both chambers
and then be signed by the U.S. President. If the Pres-
ident refuses to sign a bill (called a “veto”), it may
still become law if both chambers of Congress over-
rides the veto through a two-thirds majority.
Much less discussed is the process by which bills
come into existence. A bill is formally proposed
by a member of Congress, known as its sponsor.
Once proposed, it is routed to one or more (usu-
ally just one) of about twenty subject-specializing
committees in each chamber. Unlike floor proceed-
ings, transcripts of the proceedings of Congressional
committees are published at the discretion of the
committee and are usually publicly unavailable.
Each committee has a chairman (a member of the
majority party in the chamber) and is further divided
into subcommittees. Collectively a few thousand
bills per year are referred to Congress’ committees
for consideration. Committees then recommend (re-
port) only about 15% for consideration and voting
by the full chamber.
The U.S. House is larger (435 voting members
compared to 100 in the Senate) and, in recent his-
tory, understood to be more polarized than the Sen-
ate (McCarty et al., 2006). All of its seats are up
for election every two years. A “Congress” often
refers to a two-year instantiation of the body with a
particular set of legislators (e.g., the 112th Congress
convened on January 3, 2011 and adjourns on Jan-
uary 3, 2013). In this paper, we limit our attention
to bills referred to committees in the House.

tion about the makeup of House committees was
obtained from Charles Stewart’s resources at MIT,3
while additional sponsor and bill information (e.g.,
sponsor party affiliation and bill topic) was obtained
from E. Scott Adler and John Wilkerson’s Congres-
sional Bills Project at the University of Washing-
ton.4
In our corpus, each bill is associated with its title,
text, committee referral(s), and a binary value indi-
cating whether or not the committee reported the bill
to the chamber. We also extracted metadata, such as
sponsor’s name, from each bill’s summary page pro-
vided by the Library of Congress.
There were a total of 51,762 bills in the House
during this seventeen-year period, of which 6,828
survived committee and progressed further. See Ta-
ble 1 for the breakdown by Congress and party.
In this paper, we will consider a primary train-test
split of the bills by Congress, with the 103rd–110th
Congresses serving as the training dataset and the
111th as the test dataset. This allows us to simulate
the task of “forecasting” which bills will survive in a
future Congress. In §5.5, we will show that a similar
result is obtained on different data splits.

fied, structured form. Considerable effort must
be expended to align databases from a variety of
sources, and significant domain knowledge about
the structure of Congress and its operation is re-
quired to disambiguate the data. Further exploration
of the deeper relationships among the legislators,
their roles in past Congresses, their standing with
their constituencies, their political campaigns, and
so on, will require ongoing effort in joining data
from disparate sources.
When we consider a larger goal of understanding
legislative behavior across many legislative bodies
(e.g., states in the U.S., other nations, or interna-
tional bodies), the challenge of creating and main-
taining such reliable, clean, and complete databases
seems insurmountable.
We view text content—noisy and complex as it
is—as an attractive alternative, or at least a comple-
mentary information source. Though unstructured,
text is made up of features that are relatively easy
for humans to interpret, offering a way to not only
predict, but also explain legislative outcomes.

4 A Predictive Model
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999254">
We next consider a modeling framework for predict-
ing bill survival or death in committee. We briefly
review logistic regression models (section 4.1), then
turn to the non-textual features that form a baseline
and a starting point for the use of text (section 4.2).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.996659">
4.1 Modeling Framework
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997825">
Our approach to predicting a bill’s survival is logis-
tic regression. Specifically, let X be a random vari-
able associated with a bill, and let f be a feature vec-
tor function that encodes observable features of the
bill. Let Y be a binary random variable correspond-
ing to bill survival (Y = 1) or death (Y = 0). Let:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9939125">
expwTf(x)
pw(Y = 1  |X = x) = 1 + exp wTf(x) (1)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999977">
where w are “weight” parameters associating each
feature in the feature vector f(x) with each outcome.
This leads to the predictive rule:

XX)
( 1 if wTf(x) &gt; 0 2
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.8989405">
yO tl 0 otherwise ( )
We train the model by maximizing log-likelihood
plus a a sparsity-inducing log-prior that encourages
many weights to go to zero:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.8068975">
�
maxw i logpw(yi  |xi) − AJJwJJ1 (3)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999992409090909">
where i indexes training examples (specifically, each
training instance is a bill referred to a single com-
mittee). The second term is an i1 norm, equivalent
to a Laplacian prior on the weights. The value of
A, which controls sparsity, is chosen on a held-out
subset of the training data.
Linear models like this one, commonly called
“exponential” or “max ent” models, are attractive
because they are intelligible. The magnitude of a
weight indicates a feature’s importance in the pre-
diction, and its sign indicates the direction of the ef-
fect.
We note that the i1 regularizer is not ideal for
identifying predictive features. When two features
are strongly correlated, it tends to choose one of
them to include in the model and eliminate the other,
despite the fact that they are both predictive. It is
therefore important to remember that a weight of
zero does not imply that the corresponding feature
is unimportant. We chose to cope with this poten-
tial elimination of good features so that our models
would be compact and easily interpretable.

4.2 Features
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995702571428571">
In American politics, the survival or death of many
bills can be explained in terms of expertise, en-
trepreneurship, and procedural control, which are
manifest in committee membership, sponsor at-
tributes, and majority party affiliation. We there-
fore begin with a strong baseline that includes fea-
tures encoding many expected effects on bill suc-
cess. These include basic structural features and
some interactions.
The basic features are all binary. The value of
the random variable X includes information about
the bill, its sponsor, and the committee to which the
bill is referred. In addition to a bias feature (always
equal to 1), we include the following features:

7. For each House member j, is the bill sponsored by j
and referred to a committee he chairs? (This feature
conjoins 5 and 6.)

j and is j in the same party as the committee chair?
(This feature conjoins 2 and 6.)

Performance. Considering the 111th Congress as a
test set (6,571 instances), a most-frequent-class pre-
dictor (i.e., a constant prediction that no bill will
survive committee) achieves an error rate of 12.6%
(more details in Table 3). A model trained on
the 103rd–110th Congresses (45,191 bills) contains
3,731 instantiated features above achieved 11.8% er-
ror (again, see Table 3).
Discussion. When inspecting linear models, consid-
ering feature weights can be misleading, since (even
with regularization) large weights often correspond
to small effects in the training data. Our method-
ology for inspecting models is therefore as follows:
we calculate the impact of each feature on the final
decision for class y, defined for feature j as

where i indexes test examples (of which there are
N). Impact is the average effect of a feature on the
model’s score for class y. Note that it is not affected
5One surprisingly detrimental feature, omitted here, was
the identity of the committee. Bill success rates vary greatly
across committees (e.g., Appropriations recommends about half
of bills, while Ways and Means only 7%). We suspect that
this feature simply has poor generalization ability across Con-
gresses. (In §5.2 we will consider preferences of individuals on
committees, based on text, which appears to benefit predictive
performance.)

by the true label for an example. Impact is addi-
tive, which allows us to measure and compare the
influence of sets of features within a model on model
predictions. Impact is not, however, directly compa-
rable across models.
The highest impact features are shown in Table 2.
Unsurprisingly, the model’s predictions are strongly
influenced (toward survival) when a bill is sponsored
by someone who is on the committee and/or in the
majority party. Feature 2, the sponsor being on the
committee, accounted for nearly 27% of all (abso-
lute) impact, followed by the member-specific fea-
tures (6–8, 19%), the sponsor being in the majority
and on the committee (4, 12%), and the party of the
sponsor (1, 10%).
We note that impact as a tool for interpreting mod-
els has some drawbacks. If a large portion of bills
in the test set happen to have a particular feature,
that feature may have a high impact score for the
dominant class (death). This probably explains the
high impact of “sponsor is a Democrat” (Table 2);
Democrats led the 111th Congress, and introduced
more bills, most of which died.

We turn next to the use of text data to augment the

5.1 Functional Bill Categories
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998732222222222">
An important insight from political science is that
bills can be categorized in general ways that are re-
lated to their likelihood of success. In their study on
legislative success, Adler and Wilkerson (2005) dis-
tinguish Congressional bills into several categories
that capture bills that are on the extremes in terms
of the importance and/or urgency of the issue ad-
dressed. We expect to find that distinguishing bills
by their substance will reduce prediction errors.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.97669225">
• bills addressing trivial issues, such as those nam-
ing a federal building or facility or coining com-
memorative medals;
• bills that make technical changes to existing laws,
usually at the request of the executive agency re-
sponsible for its implementation;
• bills addressing recurring issues, such as annual
appropriations or more sporadic reauthorizations
of expiring federal programs or laws; and
• bills addressing important, urgent issues, such as
bills introduced in response to the 9/11 terrorist
attacks or a sharp spike in oil prices.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.996187104477612">
Adler and Wilkerson (2005) annotated House bills
for the 101st–105th Congresses using the above cat-
egories (all other bills were deemed to be “discre-
tionary”). Out of this set we use the portion that
overlaps with our bill collection (103rd–105th). Of
14,528 bills, 1,580 were labeled as trivial, 119 as
technical, 972 as recurring, and 1,508 as important.
Our hypothesis is that these categories can help ex-
plain which bills survive committees.
To categorize the bills in the other Congresses
of our dataset, we trained binary logistic regression
models to label bills with each of the three most fre-
quent bill types above (trivial, recurring, and impor-
tant) based on unigram features of the body of bill
text. (There is some overlap among categories in the
annotated data, so we opted for three binary clas-
sifiers rather than multi-class.) In a ten-fold cross-
validated experiment, this model averaged 83% ac-
curacy across the prediction tasks. We used the man-
ually annotated labels for the bills in the 103rd–
105th Congresses; for other bills, we calculated each
model’s probability that the bill belonged to the tar-
get category.6 These values were used to define bi-
nary indicators for each classifier’s probability re-
gions: [0, 0.3); [0.3,0.4); [0.4,0.5); [0.5, 1.0]. For
each of the three labels, we included two classifiers
trained with different hyperparameter settings, giv-
ing a total of 24 additional features. All baseline
features were retained.
Performance. Including functional category fea-
tures reduces the prediction error slightly but signif-
icantly relative to the baseline (just over 1% relative
error reduction)—see Table 3.7
Discussion. Considering the model’s weights, the
log-odds are most strongly influenced toward bill
success by bills that seem “important” according to
the classifiers. 55% of this model’s features had non-
zero impact on test-set predictions; compare this to
only 36% of the baseline model’s features.8 Further,
the category features accounted for 66% of the total
(absolute) impact of all features. Taken altogether,
these observations suggest that bill category features
are a more compact substitute for many of the base-
line features,9 but that they do not offer much ad-
ditional predictive information beyond the baseline
(error is only slightly reduced). It is also possi-
ble that our categories do not perfectly capture the
perceptions of committees making decisions about
bills. Refinement of the categories within the pre-
6In preliminary experiments, we used the 103rd–105th data
to measure the effect of automatic vs. manual categories.
Though the particulars of the earlier model and the smaller
dataset size make controlled comparison impossible, we note
that gold-standard annotations achieved 1–2% lower absolute
error across cross-validation folds.
7We note that preliminary investigations conjoining the bill
category features with baseline features did not show any gains.
Prior work by Adler and Wilkerson (2012) suggests that bill cat-
egory interacts with the sponsor’s identity, but does not consider
bill success prediction; we leave a more careful exploration of
this interaction in our framework to future work.
8Note that `1-regularized models make global decisions
about which features to include, so the new features influence
which baseline features get non-zero weights. Comparing the
absolute number of features in the final selected models is not
meaningful, since it depends on the hyperparameter A, which is
tuned separately for each model.

<bodyText confidence="0.9997865">
We next consider a different view of text: as a means
of profiling the preferences and agendas of legisla-
tors. Our hypothesis here is that committees oper-
ate similarly to the legislature as a whole: when a
bill comes to a committee for consideration, mem-
bers of the committee vote on whether it will sur-
vive. Of course, deliberation and compromise may
take place before such a vote; our simple model does
not attempt to account for such complex processes,
instead merely positing a hidden roll call vote.
Although the actions of legislators on commit-
tees are hidden, their voting behavior on the floor
is observed. Roll call data is frequently used in po-
litical science to estimate spatial models of legis-
lators and legislation (Poole and Rosenthal, 1985;
Poole and Rosenthal, 1991; Jackman, 2001; Clinton
et al., 2004). These models help visualize politics in
terms of intuitive, low-dimensional spaces which of-
ten correspond closely to our intuitions about “left”
and “right” in American politics. Recently, Gerrish
and Blei (2011) showed how such models could nat-
urally be augmented with models of text. Such mod-
els are based on observed voting; it is left to future
work to reduce the dimensionality of hidden votes
within the survival prediction model here.
Our approach is to construct a proxy vote; an es-
timate of a roll call vote by members of the com-
mittee on the bill. We consider three variants, each
based on the same estimate of the individual com-
mittee members’ votes:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999547">
• Only the committee chairman’s vote matters.
• Only majority-party committee members vote.
• All committee members vote.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999722">
We will compare these three versions of the proxy
vote feature experimentally, but abstractly they can
all be defined the same way. Let C! denote the set of
committee members who can vote on a bill x. Then
the proxy vote equals:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.957302">
|C|1EjEC E[Vj,x] (5)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.99673">
(If x is referred to more than one committee, we av-
erage the above feature across committees.) We treat
the vote by representative j on bill x as a binary ran-
dom variable Vj,x corresponding to a vote for (1) or
against (0) the bill. We do not observe Vj,x; instead
we estimate its expected value, which will be be-
tween 0 and 1. Note that, by linearity of expecta-
tion, the sum in equation 5 is the expected value of
the number of committee members who “voted” for
the bill; dividing by |C |gives a value that, if our esti-
mates are correct, should be close to 1 when the bill
is likely to be favored by the committee and 0 when
it is likely to be disfavored.
To estimate ]E[Vj,x], we use a simple probabilis-
tic model of Vj,x given the bill x and the past vot-
ing record of representative j.10 Let 9Z,j be a set of

</footnote>

<bodyText confidence="0.998834416666667">
bills that representative j has publicly voted on, on
the floor of the House, in the past.11 For x E 92 j,
let Vj,x be 1 if j voted for the bill and 0 if j voted
against it. Further, define a similarity measure be-
tween bills; here we use cosine similarity of two
bills’ tfidf vectors.12 We denote by sim(x, x0) the
similarity of bills x and x0.
The probabilistic model is as follows. First, the
representative selects a bill he has voted on previ-
ously; he is likely to choose a bill that is similar to
x. More formally, given representative j and bill x,
randomly choose a bill X0 from 92,j according to:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.917028">
p(X0 = x0  |j,x) = expT, expim
s(sim (x,x00) (6)
7
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999064571428572">
An attractive property of this distribution is that it
has no parameters to estimate; it is defined entirely
by the text of bills in g2,j. Second, the representa-
tive votes on x identically to how he voted on X0.
Formally, let Vj,x = Vj,x0, which is observed.
The above model gives a closed form for the ex-
pectation of Vj,x:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.975512">
F-[Vj,x] = Ex0∈gz,. p(X0 = x0  |j, x) - Vj,x0 (7)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.994789871794872">
In addition to the proxy vote score in eq. 5, we cal-
culate a similar expected vote based on “nay” votes,
and consider a second score that is the ratio of the
“yea” proxy vote to the “nay” proxy vote. Both
of these scores are continuous values; we quantize
them into bins, giving 141 features.13
Performance. Models built using the baseline fea-
tures plus, in turn, each of the three variations of the
proxy vote feature (C! defined to include the chair
the U.S. House consist of a very different sample of bills than
those we consider in this study; indeed, votes on the floor cor-
respond to bills that survived committee. We leave attempts to
characterize and control for this bias to future work.
11To simplify matters, we use all bills from the training pe-
riod that j has voted on. For future predictions (on the test set),
these are all in the past, but in the training set they may include
bills that come later than a given training example.
12We first eliminated punctutation and numbers from the
texts, then removed unigrams which occured in more than 75%
or less than 0.05% of the training documents. Tfidf scores were
calculated based on the result.
13We discretized the continuous values by 0.01 increment for
proxy vote score, and 0.1 increment for proxy vote rate scores.
We further combined outlier bins (one for exremely large val-
ues, one for extremely small values).
only, majority party members, or the full commit-
tee), and all three sets of proxy vote features, were
compared—see Table 3. All three models showed
improvement over the baseline. Using the chairman-
only committee (followed closely by whole commit-
tee and all three) turned out to be the best performing
among them, with a 8% relative error reduction.
Discussion. Nearly 58% of the features in the com-
bined model had non-zero impact at test time, and
38% of total absolute impact was due to these fea-
tures. Comparing the performance of these four
models suggests that, as is widely believed in polit-
ical science, the preferences of the committee chair
are a major factor in which bills survive.

5.3 Direct Use of Content: Bag of Words
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999815923076923">
Our third hypothesis is that committees make collec-
tive decisions by considering the contents of bills di-
rectly. A sensible starting point is to treat our model
as a document classifier and incorporate standard
features of the text directly into the model, rather
than deriving functional categories or proxy votes
from the text.14 Perhaps unsurprisingly, this ap-
proach will perform better than the previous two.
Following Pang and Lee (2004), who used word
and bigram features to model an author’s sentiment,
and Kogan et al. (2009), who used word and bigram
features to directly predict a future outcome, we in-
corporate binary features for the presence or absence
of terms in the body and (separately) in the title of
the bill. We include unigram features for the body
and unigram and bigram features for the title.15 The
result is 28,246 features, of which 24,515 are lexical.
Performance. Combined with baseline features,
word and bigram features led to nearly 18% relative
error reduction compared to the baseline and 9% rel-
ative to the best model above (Table 3). The model
is very small (under 200 features), and 98% of the
features in the model impacted test-time predictions.
The model’s gain over the baseline is not sensitive to
the score threshold; see Figure 1.
A key finding is that the bag of words model out-

14The models from §5.1 and §5.2 can be understood from
a machine learning perspective as task-specific dimensionality
reduction methods on the words.
15Punctuation marks are removed from the text, and numbers
are collapsed into single indicator. We filtered terms appearing
in fewer than 0.5% and more than 30% of training documents.

Finally, we considered a model using all three kinds
of text features. Shown in Table 3, this reduces error
only 2% relative to the bag of words model. This
leads us to believe that direct use of text captures
most of what functional bill category and proxy vote
features capture about bill success.
16We also experimented with dimensionality reduction with
latent Dirichlet allocation (Blei et al., 2003). We used the topic
posteriors as features in lieu of words during training and test-
ing. The symmetric Dirichlet hyperparameter was fixed at 0.1,
and we explored 10–200 topics. Although this offered speedups
in training time, the performance was consistently worse than
the bag of words model, for each number of topics.
Table 4 shows the terms with greatest impact.
When predicting bills to survive, the model seems
to focus on explanations for minor legislation. For
example, interior and resources may indicate non-
controversial local land transfer bills. In titles, des-
ignate and located have to do with naming federal
buildings (e.g., post offices).
As for bills that die, the model appears to have
captured two related facts about proposed legisla-
tion. One is that legislators often sponsor bills to
express support or concern about an issue with little
expectation that the bill will become a law. If such
“position-taking” accounts for many of the bills pro-
posed, then we would expect features with high im-
pact toward failure predictions to relate to such is-
sues. This would explain the terms energy, security,
and human (if used in the context of human rights or
human cloning). The second fact is that some bills
die because committees ultimately bundle their con-
tents into bigger bills. There are many such bills re-
lating to tax policy (leading to the terms contained in
the trigram Internal Revenue Service, the American
tax collection agency) and Social Security policy (a
collection of social welfare and social insurance pro-
grams), for example.17
17The term speaker likely refers to the first ten bill numbers,
which are “reserved for the speaker,” which actually implies that
no bill was introduced. Our process for marking bills that sur-
vive (based on committee recommendation data) leaves these
unmarked, hence they “died” in our gold-standard data. The
experiments revealed this uninteresting anomaly.

From a political science perspective, our experimen-
tal results using text underscore the importance of
considering the substance of policy proposals (here,
bills) when attempting to explain their progress. An
important research direction in political science, one
in which NLP must play a role, is how different
types of issues are managed in legislatures. Our re-
sults also suggest that political considerations may
induce lawmakers to sponsor certain types of bills
with no real expectation of seeing them enacted into
law.
Considerable recent work has modeled text along-
side data about social behavior. This includes pre-
dictive settings (Kogan et al., 2009; Lerman et
al., 2008), various kinds of sentiment and opin-
ion analysis (Thomas et al., 2006; Monroe et al.,
2008; O’Connor et al., 2010; Das et al., 2009), and
exploratory models (Steyvers and Griffiths, 2007).
In political science specifically, the “text as data”
movement (Grimmer and Stewart, 2012; O’Connor
et al., 2011) has leveraged tools from NLP in quan-
titative research. For example, Grimmer (2010) and
Quinn et al. (2006) used topic models to study, re-
spectively, Supreme Court proceedings and Senate
speeches. Closest to this work, Gerrish and Blei
(2011) combined topic models with spatial roll call
models to predict votes in the legislature from text
alone. Their best results, however, came from a
text regression model quite similar to our direct text
model.

We presented a novel task: predicting whether a

In their study on legislative success, Adler and Wilkerson (2005) distinguish Congressional bills into several categories that capture bills that are on the extremes in terms of the importance and/or urgency of the issue addressed. We expect to find that distinguishing bills by their substance will reduce prediction errors. • bills addressing trivial issues, such as those naming a federal building or facility or coining commemorative medals; • bills that make technical changes to existing laws, usually at the request of the executive agency responsible for its implementation; • bills addressing recurring issues, such as annual appropriations or more sporadi</context>

Central to that process is language. Text data emerging from the process include debates among legislators (Laver et al., 2003; Quinn et al., 2010; Beigman Klebanov et al., 2008), press releases (Grimmer, 2010), accounts of these debates in the press, policy proposals, and laws. In the work reported here, we seek to exploit text data—specifically, the text of Congressional bills— to understand the lawmaking process. We consider an especially murky part of that process that is difficult to study because it happens largely behind closed doors: the handling of bills by Congressional committees. This early stage of a bill’s life is precarious: roughly 85% of bills do not survive committee. By contrast, nearly 90% of bills that are recommended by a committee (i.e., survive</context>

This suggests that there is more information in the text contents than either the functional categories or similarity to past bills.16 5.4 Full Model Finally, we considered a model using all three kinds of text features. Shown in Table 3, this reduces error only 2% relative to the bag of words model. This leads us to believe that direct use of text captures most of what functional bill category and proxy vote features capture about bill success. 16We also experimented with dimensionality reduction with latent Dirichlet allocation (Blei et al., 2003). We used the topic posteriors as features in lieu of words during training and testing. The symmetric Dirichlet hyperparameter was fixed at 0.1, and we explored 10–200 topics. Although this offered speedups in training time, the performance was consistently worse than the bag of words model, for each number of topics. Table 4 shows the terms with greatest impact. When predicting bills to survive, the model seems to focus on explanations for minor legislation. For example, interior and resources may indicate noncontroversial local land transfer bills.

A sensible starting point is to treat our model as a document classifier and incorporate standard features of the text directly into the model, rather than deriving functional categories or proxy votes from the text.14 Perhaps unsurprisingly, this approach will perform better than the previous two. Following Pang and Lee (2004), who used word and bigram features to model an author’s sentiment, and Kogan et al. (2009), who used word and bigram features to directly predict a future outcome, we incorporate binary features for the presence or absence of terms in the body and (separately) in the title of the bill. We include unigram features for the body and unigram and bigram features for the title.15 The result is 28,246 features, of which 24,515 are lexical. Performance. Combined with baseline features, word and bigram features led to nearly 18% relative error reduction compared to the baseline and 9% relative to the best model above (Table 3).

Each committee has a chairman (a member of the majority party in the chamber) and is further divided into subcommittees. Collectively a few thousand bills per year are referred to Congress’ committees for consideration. Committees then recommend (report) only about 15% for consideration and voting by the full chamber. The U.S. House is larger (435 voting members compared to 100 in the Senate) and, in recent history, understood to be more polarized than the Senate (McCarty et al., 2006). All of its seats are up for election every two years.

A sensible starting point is to treat our model as a document classifier and incorporate standard features of the text directly into the model, rather than deriving functional categories or proxy votes from the text.14 Perhaps unsurprisingly, this approach will perform better than the previous two. Following Pang and Lee (2004), who used word and bigram features to model an author’s sentiment, and Kogan et al. (2009), who used word and bigram features to directly predict a future outcome, we incorporate binary features for the presence or absence of terms in the body and (separately) in the title of the bill. We include unigram features for the body and unigram and bigram features for the title.15 The result is 28,246 features, of which 24,515 are lexical. Performance. Combined with baseline features, word and bigram features led to nearly 18% relative error reduction compared to the baseline and 9% relative to the </context>

We augment the model with information from the contents of bills, comparing different hypotheses about how a committee decides a bill’s fate. These models give significant reductions in prediction error and highlight the importance of bill substance in explanations of policy-making and agenda-setting. 1 Introduction In representative governments, laws result from a complex social process. Central to that process is language. Text data emerging from the process include debates among legislators (Laver et al., 2003; Quinn et al., 2010; Beigman Klebanov et al., 2008), press releases (Grimmer, 2010), accounts of these debates in the press, policy proposals, and laws. In the work reported here, we seek to exploit text data—specifically, the text of Congressional bills— to understand the lawmaking process. We consider an especially murky part of that process that is difficult to study because it happens largely behind closed doors: the handling of bills by Congressional committees. This early stage of a bill’s life is precarious: roughly 85% of bills do not survive committee. By contrast, nearly 90% of bills that are recommend</context>
