The Wordtree is a combination of a knowledge represen-
tation system and a thesaurus. Although it claims that it
is &amp;quot;the word system for solving physical and social prob-
lems branch by branch,&amp;quot; it appears to be primarily an
organization of English words, plus some rare and made-
up words, according to actions. A complete hierarchy,
starting with create, is defined for 20,000 transitive verbs.
Every transitive verb is defined by giving two other
verbs: one which is more general, and the other which
when combined with the more general term selects the
particular word being defined. Thus each node in the
hierarchy is a particular verb; its parent is a more general
verb, which is related to the node in question by combi-
nation with another specific verb. From each node you
can find a more general verb (except, of course, for the
root); or, by looking underneath the node, you can find a
list of more specific verbs. Noun-like concepts are
indexed into the verbs that produce them. For many
verbs, suitable nouns to act as instrumentalities or objects
are given.
For example, suppose one wishes to use The Wordtree
to produce world peace (the book claims &amp;quot;to maneuver
or change the world, use the Wordtree&amp;quot;). You look up
peace, and it tells you that it is produced by pacify and
negotiate. How do you do either of those things? You
look them up and it refers you to pacify at number
17477, a subclass of emotionize distinguished by please,
i.e., to pacify people or things, you should simultaneously
emotionize them and please them. Similarly, negotiate
(9191) is the combination of maneuver and effect. Strings
like emotionize, which are not common English, appear
frequently: this one is in the hierarchy as brain and
ekphore, where ekphore is the negative of excess and loud-
en. The message then, is that one can pacify by commu-
nicating quietly and pleasantly; one can negotiate by
maneuvering with effect. Or, to quote Teddy Roosevelt,
&amp;quot;speak softly and carry a big stick.&amp;quot;
The reduction of all concepts to a hierarchical struc-
ture, with the expectation of great benefits, has been
tried before. John Wilkins wrote in 1668, &amp;quot;the reducing
of all things and notions, to such kind of Tables, as are
here proposed (were it as compleatly done as it might be)
would prove the shortest and plainest way for the attain-
ment of real Knowledge, that hath been yet offered to
the World.&amp;quot; This is from the introduction to his Essay
Towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language
(reprinted by Scolar Press Ltd, 1968). Wilkins used a
two-dimensional tabular representation of his hierarchy.
Compared to the linearized hierarchy printed in The
Wordtree, Wilkins&apos;s table is much easier to scan. Also,
Wilkins&apos;s book is printed in upper and lower case and in
a large type size; Burger uses a tiny, upper-case only,
six-column format that is hard to read (in fairness, as a
result his book is much easier to carry). The Wordtree is
also made less accessible by the rare or made-up words; I
open at random to page 128 and find items like zipcodese-
quence, enmagazine, satevepost, bodge, encist, ecphorize,
and vorlauf. Burger&apos;s linearization of the hierarchy also
produces some strange results; for page after page, for
example, the chemical elements, listed in order, are inter-
leaved with parts of the world. On page 114, as an
example, one finds the following &amp;quot;words&amp;quot; in the follow-
ing order: scotchify, promethiate, hispaniolize, gaelicize,
samariate, westindianize, europiate, gadolinate (where
europiate is from the chemical element europium, and is
to be distinguished from europeanize). Yes, the hierarchi-
cal relations, if you track the numbers, are keeping the
lists of elements and of countries distinct; but the result is
that The Wordtree is hard to browse, requiring constant
references to the category numbers and/or the index to
find things.
I tried a sample word problem. A friend asked over
lunch for an alternative to represent in contexts similar to
&amp;quot;In electronic mail anger is sometimes represented by
capital letters.&amp;quot; I thought offhand of manifest and then
returned to look this up. A conventional Roget&apos;s Thesau-
rus gave almost immediately such words as indicate, illu-
minate, emphasize, show, brandish, disclose, flaunt,
dramatize, reflect, feature, demonstrate, symbolize,
evidence, personify, highlight, express, formulate under the
heading for manifest that included represent. In The
Wordtree I find manifest (5611) as show and unclose.
Under it are activate, feature, landmark and other less
relevant words. Above manifest I track back through the
sequence show (5179), reveal (4792), illuminate (4440),
luminate (4075), lumine (3727), light (3354) [at this
point, thinking of Genesis 1:3 I hoped I was near the
beginning of the hierarchy, but no such luck], ir (3104),
microwave (2909), shortwave (2708), radio (2567), heat
(2352), warm (1990), tepefy (1482), thermalize (990),
agitate (718), alternate (456), interchange (251), mutual-
ize (151), affect (95), change (54), and create (1). Above
represent the sequence goes through intend, halfintend,
mind, perceive, sense, morse [as in Morse code], encode,
cipher, substitute, favor, like, aestheticize, acculturate,
accustom, habituate, characterize, pattern, model, represent
and we have reached a circularity (noted in the book).

gerrymander, dummy, sample, foist, portray, belie, mirror,
depict, typify, hippodrome, describe, describble, lament,
paraphrase, blackbox, blazon and other words. Finding
the words for this paragraph took an hour, and required
looking at many pages of the book. Note that there is no
common parent of represent and manifest.
What about Wilkins? Represent is under &amp;quot;Transcen-
dental Relations of Action&amp;quot; along with manifest (respec-
tively under the subheadings comparate and simple tran-
scendental relations). They are on facing pages and in
the immediate vicinity of these two words are declare,
show, exhibit, present, reveal, set forth, come to light,.
render, demonstrate, and disclose. So I would rather have
the older book, which also does not begin with dire warn-
ings about what will happen to anyone who even reads a
photocopy, much less makes one.

The basic idea of The Wordtree, to represent a hierar-
chy exclusively of actions, and connect all objects to the
actions by the correct case relation, is an interesting one.
This conforms with general linguistic ideas of predicates
as dominating sentences, and it permits a different
approach to a word list than any conventional alphabet-
ical ordering. However, in order to make a strict hierar-
chy, it has been necessary to oversimplify considerably.
For example to fish is defined as to catch and draw; this
would seem to cover a great many types of capturing
beyond conventional fishing (consider photography,
tempting, stealing, harvesting, etc.). The word lasso,
which might also be thought to cover catching and draw-
ing, is defined as springe and target where springe is inter-
cept and snare. The sense of catch meaning to stop or halt
is, I think, snaggle (interrupt and catch). It may be that
there is no simple way to print a book of this information
and only a proper interactive computer display would
serve. But I doubt that any format change can deal with
the impossibility of placing each word in a unique posi-
tion in a hierarchy of actions, which must inevitably
suppress many shades of meaning and connotation.
It would greatly improve The Wordtree if the hierarchi-
cal structure could be displayed somehow; I found it very
tedious to track back and find the parents of the words I
had. It would also be easier to read if printed in larger
tylie, and if the quantity of unusual words were
decreased. But even so, I find the organization of the
word lists so unusual and so personal that I am not sure I
could make much use of them anyway. Part of the prob-
lem may be that since each word has only one spot in the
hierarchy, new words are made up to handle the other
senses of the ambiguous words, and the result is some-
times hard to understand. Yes, throw has many mean-
ings, but does using pepperoni for throw and maneuver
help the reader?
Although The Wordtree is definitely something new, I
do not find the exclusively verb-based structure conven-
ient. It clashes, in many cases, with traditional and famil-
iar arrangements of countries, chemical elements, and so
forth. On balance I would recommend those with good
libraries to read the work of Bishop Wilkins instead. As
an example of idea classification for lofty and ambitious
goals, it is more accessible to the reader and of historical
as well as linguistic interest.
