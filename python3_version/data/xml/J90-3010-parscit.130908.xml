METATAXIS IN PRACTICE: DEPENDENCY SYNTAX FOR difficult questions, for which this book offers some good practical

Tesniere&apos;s term metataxe refers to structural change in transla-
tion. In this book, a product of the DLT machine translation
project, metataxis refers to the rules required to link the depen-
dency syntaxes of two different languages for translation. The
book gives dependency syntaxes for a variety of languages—
German, Danish, Polish, Bengali, Finnish, Hungarian, Japanese,
and Esperanto—and metataxes for Esperanto to French and
English to Esperanto (Esperanto being the interlingua of the DLT
system). The emphasis is on the practical details of the grammars.

This book reviews the methodology used in the assessment of
speech recognition and synthesis systems. The text is based on a
report that was prepared as part of the ESPRIT (European
Strategic Program for Research and Development of Information
Technology) program. Thus, although the editors are all from the
University College London, the authors of the various chapters
represent a broad sample of the major speech research centers in
Europe.
The book is composed of six major chapters, with an introduc-
tion and a final note on future developments. An extensive bibliog-
raphy is included at the end, along with a glossary, an index, and
an appendix listing the project partners. The four major chapters
cover assessment of speech recognition systems (Chapter 2),
assessment of text-to-speech synthesis systems (Chapter 3), speech
databases (Chapter 4), and transcription and labeling of speech
data (Chapter 5). The last two chapters discuss applied issues
relating to tools that are useful in the development of speech
systems and management of large databases. The coverage in the
four major chapters is generally very complete. Chapter 3 on
text-to-speech is excellent.
The worst aspect of the book is its appearance; particularly the
typesetting and page formatting. The typesetting is so poor it
leads one to wonder if these people should try speech input/
output. Of course, speech I/O would obviate the typesetting
problem. The best aspect of the book is its technical content. Any
serious developer or consumer of speech technology can gain by
careful study of this book. Furthermore, the multilingual mission
of this ESPRIT project forced the authors to confront a number of
starting points.—Jared Bernstein, SRI International

Harold Somer&apos;s review of From Syntax to Semantics
(Erich Steiner et al., eds.) in Computational Linguistics
16(1) March 1990, was marred by typographical errors
that, ironically, occurred just at the point where the re-
viewer was quoting an example of bad typography in the
book under review. Hence, errors of this journal appeared
to be attributed to the book.
The paragraph in question, which appeared near the top
of page 48, should have read as follows:
Apart from jargon and unobtainable references, other
problems with the book include some disastrous typeset-
ting; notably, for example, the use of slash, bold slash,
backslash, and vertical bar in one of the formalisms (pp.
120ff ), and the nonuse of superscripts and subscripts from
time to time, as in this example:
Xn bar (Cl . . . Cm) Xn — 1 bar (Cm + 1 . . . Cn)
(where each Ci is a maximal projection or a lexical
formative)
The MIT Press apologizes for the error.
