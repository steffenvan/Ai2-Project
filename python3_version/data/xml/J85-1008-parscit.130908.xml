We describe a new approach to semantic interpretation in natural
language understanding, and mechanisms for both lexical and structural
disambiguation that work in concert with the semantic interpreter.
Traditionally, translation from the parse tree of a sentence to a seman-
tic representation (such as frames or procedural semantics) has always
been the most ad hoc part of natural language understanding
systems. However, recent advances in linguistics, most notably the system
of formal semantics known as Montague semantics, suggest ways of
putting semantic interpretation onto a cleaner and firmer foundation.
Absity, the system we describe, is a Montague-inspired semantic inter-
preter. Like Montague formalisms, our semantics is compositional by
design and is strongly typed, with semantic rules in one-to-one correspond-
ence with the meaning-affecting rules of a Marcus parser. We have
replaced the Montague semantic objects — functors and truth conditions —
with elements of the frame language Frail. Absity&apos;s partial results are
always well-formed Frail objects.
A semantic interpreter must be able to provide feedback to the parser
to help it handle structural ambiguities. In Absity, this is done by the
&amp;quot;Semantic Enquiry Desk&amp;quot;, a process that answers the parser&apos;s questions on
semantic preferences. Disambiguation of word senses and of case slots is
done by a set of procedures, one per word or slot, each of which deter-
mines its correct sense in cooperation with the others. A partially disam-
biguated procedure&apos;s remaining possibilities are well-formed Frail objects
that can be seen and used by other processes, including the Semantic
Enquiry Desk, just as a person can see many of the details of a partly
developed &amp;quot;instant&amp;quot; photograph.

It is from the fact that partial results are always well-formed semantic
objects that the system gains much of its power. This, in turn, comes from
the strict correspondence between syntax and semantics in Absity. The
result is a foundation for semantic interpretation that we believe to be
superior to previous approaches.

This dissertation presents a linguistic approach, based on test-score
semantics and fuzzy logic, to the problem of fuzzy temporal inference in
question answering systems.
While several models have been proposed for the analysis of historical
information, little research has been done satisfactorily on the manipu-
lation of fuzzy temporal quantifiers such as &amp;quot;a few days ago,&amp;quot; which
refers to absolute count, and &amp;quot;often&amp;quot;, which refers to relative count. In
In this dissertation, the theory of possibility is taken as an appropriate
framework for dealing with such a problem.
The first step of the approach, for statements with absolute-count
temporal quantifiers only, is to translate these statements into their corre-
sponding possibility assignment equations using test-score semantics. Time
information among events can then be inferred from these equations by
deriving its possibility distribution. The compositional rule of inference
plays the central role in solving the equations. The algorithm for comput-
ing the compositional rule can be transformed into one similar to Gaussian
elimination for the solution of linear equations. This method is straightfor-
ward but inefficient. An improved technique is proposed which represents
all quantifiers by fuzzy numbers and replaces the rule of composition with
fuzzy addition. With this technique the desired possibility distribution can
be obtained by applying a generalized Warshall&apos;s algorithm on the Time-
Relation-Matrix, which is a representation for given information.
As for quantifiers which refer to relative count, such as &amp;quot;often,&amp;quot; fuzzy
multiplication will play the primary role. Finally, all mechanisms amount
to a fuzzy temporal logic, which serves as an inference tool for temporal
information analysis.
This computational approach to fuzzy temporal quantifiers has the
following advantages. (1) It subsumes those approaches based on two
valued logic as limiting cases. (2) It deals uniformly with the relative and
absolute time relations. (3) It is easy to implement. (4) It can ge general-
ized to apply to other quantifiers used in different concepts such as
temperature and distance.
Several models have been advanced in the literature pertaining to the
process of ambiguity resolution known as disambiguation. The key
models include: (1) The MacKay Model; (2) The Schvaneveldt Model;
(3) The Single Meaning/Multiple Meaning Hypothesis; (4) The Selective
Access Hypothesis; and (5) The Prior Context Hypothesis.
This dissertation, through means of a literature search and a field
experiment, attempts to sort the usefulness of these models according to
their validity with respect to a large ambiguity edifice, in this case a para-
graph from the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. A test instrument was developed
which elicited responses through a progressively more complex and struc-
tured set of questions about the ambiguity in the sentences. These data
were analyzed according to dominant response characteristics and by
means of Pearson r correlations for relationships between linguistic level,
order of processing, and subjects&apos; decision-making.
Test data were consistent with evidence for the above-mentioned
models, but restricted their use to particular steps within a general proc-
ess of disambiguation. The data showed surface structure to be a less
important factor in disambiguation than lexical and underlying/symbolic

structures for the tasks performed. Data also show context influences in
the decision-making process of ambiguity resolution. The literature review
and test data are incorporated into a proposed general paradigm of the
disambiguation process which interfaces knowledge-based mental activities
with structure-based mental activities.
The general paradigm of the disambiguation process follows order-of-
processing steps in the following manner: (1) Associate memory retrieval
based on prior context or previous knowledge-base; (2) Scanning of the
three fundamental linguistic levels for the purpose of locating the &amp;quot;field&amp;quot; in
which the ambiguity resolution is to occur; (3) Problem-solving within the
selected linguistic level; (4) Tentative ambiguity resolution (disambigua-
tion) based on a meshing of the lexical and underlying correlations; (5)
Evaluative feedback of the resolution based on tentative utilization; and
(6) More permanent integration of the resolution into the total language
context or &amp;quot;field at a given time.&amp;quot;.

One of the most perplexing problems in Information Science has been
definition of central concepts such as &amp;quot;relevance&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;information&amp;quot; at a
theoretical level which incorporates and accounts for all known attributes
of the concepts and the principles which underlie their particular applica-
tion in this field. The objective of this thesis was to determine whether
one definition of relevance, &amp;quot;aboutness&amp;quot;, can be based, at least in part,
on textual characteristics of queries and abstracts. To this end, this study
was conducted to determine to what extent a set of functional relations
based on Fillmore&apos;s case grammar theory could be used to explain the
correspondence between patterns of language behavior in aboutness recog-
nition and language patterns in the texts of queries and abstracts. The test
environment was a real-life bibliographic retrieval system. Thirty subject
specialists (advanced graduate students and university faculty from the
Sciences, Social Sciences and Humanities) submitted queries and
performed relevance assessments using &amp;quot;aboutness&amp;quot; as the operational
definition for their judgements. An analysis of functional relations
between the keyterms in the queries and abstracts was compared to the
subject specialists&apos; decisions. The result was that the agreement between
the subject specialists&apos; decisions and the decisions based on a match in
functional relations between the queries and abstracts was 97%. The
conclusion reached on the basis of this finding is that abstracts judged to
be about the topic named in a query did contain the desired keyterms in
functional relations which matched the functional relations between those
keyterms in the query; and abstracts judged to be not about the topic
named in the query did contain the same or equivalent keyterms, but not in
functional relations which matched the functional relations in the query.
The high level of agreement between the aboutness decisions based on
functional relations and the subject specialists&apos; decisions demonstrates
clearly the consistency of language behavior in relevance assessments
where the definition on which the decisions are made is aboutness or
match in topic. These conclusions have implications for indexing systems,
query negotiation, search strategy formation, retrieval system research and
the development of interface mechanisms for on-line retrieval systems.
This study was designed to examine the validity of Kaplan&apos;s (1966)
notion of Contrastive Rhetoric: that culture groups organize their
thoughts in writing in culture-specific ways. The study focused on identi-
fying and describing culture-specific strategies beyond the scope of expli-
citly-taught rhetorical conventions, while also examining the effect(s) of
discourse topic on those organizational strategies. This led to a twofold
hypothesis. (1) When writing about a &amp;quot;culturally-loaded&amp;quot; topic, subjects

are more likely to exhibit culture-specific strategies. (2) When writing
about a &amp;quot;universal&amp;quot; (and emotionally neutral) topic, subjects are more
likely to exhibit collective (i.e., similar) strategies. Data consisted of essays
in English on two topics written by Japanese, Arabic, and native English
speakers as part of a classroom assignment. All subjects, fifteen in each
group, were students in high-intermediate to advanced &amp;esl. class- es or in
university freshman composition classes; all subjects reported little or no
formal writing instruction. The essay topics were: (1) What is (or should
be) the role of old people in society? (2) What is a bicycle and how does it
work?
The text analysis used a system of eleven logical relations adapted from
categories proposed by Meyer (1975), Milic (1969), Halliday and Hasan
(1976), and Jacobs (1982). The data were analyzed for similarities and
differences across topics and subject groups in three areas: (1) type and
use of interpropositional logical relations; (2) structure of the texts; and
(3) use of subordinate arguments (or information).
Results lend support to Kaplan&apos;s notion of Contrastive Rhetoric, but
with modification. All groups used the same logical relations and strategies
of organization; i.e., none was group-specific. However, the frequency
with which these strategies were used differed among the three groups.
Therefore, we can speak only of culturally &amp;quot;preferred,&amp;quot; not culture-specif-
ic, strategies of organization. Further, in support of our hypothesis, the
topic of discourse appeared to influence how groups organized the text;
both culturally preferred and collective strategies differed across topics.
Pedagogical implications and directions for future research are discussed.
The problem of what motivates speakers and writers choose a given
linguistic forms to refer to an item at a given point in a text has been of
interest recently to researchers in linguistics, cognitive pyschology, and
artificial intelligence. While this research has provided many valuable
insights into particular aspects of the problem, no work to date has tried
to provide a view of anaphora that is at once comprehensive — encom-
passing a wide range of test-types and anaphoric environments — and
sufficiently detailed to allow for specific predictions. The present study
attempts to fill this gap by examining at a fine level of detail the patterning
of anaphora in English in a variety of text-types.
The fundamental assertion of this thesis is that discourse anaphora
cannot be understood unless we examine the hierarchical organization of
the texts which are the sources of the anaphors. In this study I have there-
fore adopted three hierarchical models of discourse — one of each text-type
explored — so that a hierarchical structure of each individual text can be
correlated with the patterns of anaphora it displays. The models used are:
rhetorical structure analysis (expository texts), story structure analysis
(narrative texts), and conversational analysis (non-story conversational
texts). These models are used as analytic tools for understanding the
structure of the texts involved.
In addition, it is claimed here that structural factors are not the only
principles that guide referential choice in discourse; other non-structural
principles (such as disagreement and classification) also play a role in influ-
encing anaphoric selection.
Finally, it is claimed here that anaphoric patterning varies quite widely
across text-types, so that a statement of distribution that is based on one
text-type cannot be accurate for the language as a whole, or for any other
given text-type. This finding raises difficult issues concerning the nature of
linguistic descriptions; in particular it calls into question the common aim
in linguistics of describing how a particular linguistic item is used in the
language, as opposed to in a particular text-type. It is suggested that such

general claims about the uses of linguistic items may not be appropriate in
the context of a multi-genre society.

Until recently, conversation, considered even now by some to be outside
the scope of linguistics, has been neglected in linguistic research. Chapter
One of this dissertation argues that the popular distinction between &apos;theo-
ries of language structure&apos; and &apos;theories of language use&apos; might be aban-
doned in order to allow a more integrated study of language and a clearer
understanding of the nature of language in the context of human life.
To forward such an integrated study, a theoretical model on which to
base the analysis of both conversation structure and other linguistic struc-
tures must be developed. The tagmemic model, developed by Kenneth
Pike, Robert Longacre, and others, allows the same set of procedures to be
used to analyze paragraphs, texts, and conversations as is used in analyzing
words, phrases, and clauses. Chapter Two presents this model.
Consideration of the context of conversation is necessary for the
adequate analysis of the conversation itself. Chapter Three illustrates the
description of a speech situation using a revision of Pike&apos;s (1967) tagmem-
ic methodology developed for the analysis of &apos;behavioremes&apos;. The
proposed revisions give attention to the three hierarchically structured
main components of the speech situation: the physical world; the events;
and, the cultural matrix. One particular behavioreme (speech situation)
analyzed in Chapter Three is a wedding ceremony.
Chapter Four focuses on conversation as a particular complex of
events in the behavioreme. Conversational exchanges such as question-
answer and proposal-compliance are analyzed in terms of the tagmemic
slot-filler and form-function distinctions. Several conversations are
analyzed in this fashion. Although the focus in Chapter Four is on the
exchange level, the relations among conversational exchanges and other
levels of structure are pointed to.
Chapter Five summarizes the conclusions of the study. Appendices
One and Two present much of the data analyzed in Chapters Three and
Four respectively.
Two main goals of this dissertation have been (1) to demonstrate some
of the structural patterns in conversation and the speech situation, and (2)
to develop a model that facilitates an integrated analysis of conversation
and other levels of linguistic and nonlinguistic structure.
In this dissertation I argue for the validity of definitions for semantic
representation from the point of view of Jerrold J. Katz&apos;s semantic theo-
ry. I argue that definitions are valid regardless of whether one looks at
language as a psychological object or an abstract object, or if one is inter-
ested in a psycholinguistic theory of language performance. I examine a
number of recent criticisms of a definitional account of meaning and
present various replies to them. I develop a semantic marker account of
causative verbs in order to illustrate the explanatory adequacy of a defini-
tional theory.
This study explores some aspects of translation from English to Japanese
in terms of a relatively small set of semantic notions, while focusing on
certain dimensions of verb semantics. These dimensions include (1) the
ways in which the notion of &amp;ong., typically expressed in
English by the progressive form, is realized for verbs of motion and verbs
of change of state in Japanese, (2) the properties of certain Japanese
double-verb constructions which correspond to verb plus preposition
expressions in English, and (3) the properties of a class of transitive verbs

in Japanese which resists passivization, unlike their English counterparts.
It will be seen that certain crucial semantic properties are involved, proper-
ties which can be represented as: +/-PERFECTIVE, MANNER, EXTENT
OF SPACE, POINT OF SPACE, (END POINT particular) and others.
Chapter 1 explains the nature and purpose of this study, reviews the
general literature, and surveys the content of the following four chapters.
Chapter 2 discusses the interaction of semantic notions such as
-PERFECTIVE and -MANNER for verbs of motion like aruku &apos;walk,&apos; and
+PERFECTIVE and POINT OF SPACE for verbs of motion like iku &apos;go,&apos;
when the notion of &amp;ong. is communicated from English to Japanese.
Chapter 3 discusses the interaction of very much the same set of semantic
notions embodied in the translation of verb plus preposition expression in
English into double-verb constructions in Japanese. In Chapter 4, we
characterize a class of transitive verbs in Japanese which resists passiviza-
tion. These involve the notion EXTENT OF SPACE, which may be associ-
ated with the notion END POINT or RESULT. These transitive verbs
frequently have intransitive counterparts which focus only on the resulting
state, corresponding to the END POINT for motion verbs. This semantic
correspondence between transitive and intransitive pairs of verbs affects
the acceptability of inanimate theme (or patient) passives in Japanese.
Chapter 5 discusses the conclusions of this study and considers several
other areas of verb semantics for which some or all of the features we have
examined may be relevant.

The investigator uses Halliday and Hasan&apos;s (1976) paradigm of cohesion
devices as the basis for synthesizing a paradigm which she applies to a
sample of published general academic written texts as a beginning
description of the systemic cohesion devices associated with that register.
She also incorporates Gray&apos;s (1977) concept of the core assertion into
the study in order to examine the extent to systematic cohesion
devices in the surface sentence interface with one interpretation of the
basic meaning units of the sentence.
Twelve sample texts, all approximately 400 words in length, were
excerpted from the American Scholar and Daedalus in beginning, middle
and end sections. They were analyzed for the following: (1) type-token
frequency counts of the systemic devices included in the paradigm; (2)
measures of textual distance between cohesion device and referent for
those cohesion devices identified in the sample corpus; (3) linear sequenc-
ing of cohesion devices within the 12 texts; and (4) the co-occurrences of
systemic cohesion devices and core assertional elements in the sentences of
the text blocks. The analysis relies heavily upon visual representation of
the structure of cohesion in the sample texts.
The major findings were as follows: (1) systemic cohesion devices were
found to connect almost all sentences in the sample text blocks; (2) lexical
cohesion devices were found to occur with greater frequency in the sample
texts than either grammatical cohesion devices or conjunctive cohesion
devices; (3) textual distance between cohesion device and referent were
found to vary significantly among the three major types of cohesion
devices: grammatical, lexical, and conjunctive; (4) systemic cohesion
devices and core assertions were found to vary systematically; and (5)
certain differences were found to exist among the beginning, middle, and
end sections of the texts both with respect to the patterning of cohesion
devices and the patterning of assertions.
The system of systemic cohesion in these published academic texts is
seen as a multi-faceted reticulated network, co-occurring with other hierar-
chical systems in a way that is analogous to Hofstadter&apos;s concept of

This dissertation proposes some changes in the Government-Binding
Theory presented in Noam Chomsky&apos;s Lectures on Government and
Binding. The changes are primarily related to the means by which the
boundedness of syntactic movement is derived in the theory. It is argued,
first, that the principle of subjacency, referred to by Chomsky as &amp;quot;the
theory of bounding,&amp;quot; should be replaced by extensions of existing
government and binding principles. A detailed proposal for such a
replacement is then presented. It is then shown that this proposal can be
used to explain a number of other phenomena, not directly related to
boundedness.
Chapter 1 serves as a general introduction. It summarizes the disserta-
tion and offers some additional introductory comments. Chapters 2 and 3
motivate the replacement of subjacency. The former is concerned with
learnability, arguing that the parameter which is associated with subjacency
is not learnable. This argument is extended to include other parameters of
GB Theory, as well. Chapter 3 offers extensive arguments against the use
of subjacency in GB Theory. Arguments are presented from both a
linguistic perspective and a learnability perspective.
Chapters 4 and 5 are the heart of the dissertation. The former offers a
theory of binding, differing greatly from standard theories. The central
idea is that an anaphor must be bound from the closest position from
which it could be bound. This requirement applies to lexical anaphors,
PRO, and traces (including trace of wh-movement). In Chapter 5 it is
argued that this binding theory, in conjunction with Chomsky&apos;s Empty
Category Principle, makes subjacency unnecessary. Exceptional Govern-
ment (EG) is also introduced in this chapter as a means of deriving the
cases in which movement is relatively unbounded, i.e., cases in which
extraction is possible. In Chapter 6 EG is used to explain several addi-
tional phenomena. These include the distribution of null complementizers
in tensed complement clauses, the distribution of infinitives, and raising
and Exceptional Case Marking. The fact that these phenomena can be
explained by the same principle used in Chapter 5 to explain extraction is
taken as further evidence favoring that theory of extraction.
Forty subjects (ages 3,4 to Adult) acted out a series of 2-sentence stories
containing two types of anaphors: full pronouns or missing-objects. Test
items varied as a function of: (1) Presence or absence of a syntactic
constraint on grammatically acceptable resolutions of the anaphor (the
missing-subject constraint, specifying the selection of the main clause
subject as antecedent applied to all missing-subject items; the c-command
constraint blocked forward and backward anaphora for some pronominal
items); (2) Direction of anaphora; (3) Semantic bias; (4) Topic bias; and
(5) Grammatical role of the anaphor.
The youngest children (ages 3-4) treated pronouns as deictic markers
of references if there was no antecedent already available in the linguistic
context. They selected sentence-external referents for pronouns in
sentence-initial main clauses, whether or not anaphora was blocked, and
sentence-internal referents for all other items. They tended to choose the
subject (NP1) or object (NP2) of the clause not containing the anaphor as
antecendent for both pronominal and missing-subject items (except in
cases where semantic biases made one interpretation more likely than
another). This suggests that these children had not adduced syntactic
restrictions on the resolution of anaphora.

The middle group (ages 7-8) treated pronouns and missing-subjects as
markers of the &amp;quot;thematic subject&amp;quot;. They selected NP1 (or the nominated
topic, if different) as antecedent for both pronominal and missing-subject
anaphors, irrespective of syntactic properties of the sentences in which
they occurred. Thus, for this group, hypotheses of an anaphoric function
of pronouns and missing-subjects superseded syntactic hypotheses.
Adults manifested a strong bias in favor of sentence-internal interpre-
tations of the anaphors, which competed with structure-dependent rules
constraining anaphora. They offered exophoric interpretations only part of
the time when c-command blocked sentence-internal interpretations, and
they rarely offered sentence-external readings of the pronouns where such
interpretations were viable options. Adults evidenced a constraint on miss-
ing-subject interpretation, consistently selecting NP1 as antecedent for the
null anaphors, even when NP2 was nominated as topic.
The results suggest that, at all ages, subjects&apos; interpretations are deter-
mined by a combination of structural and functional hypotheses which
evolve in tandem throughout childhood.
This dissertation proposes and tests a model of how the cues of
word order, noun animacy, and case inflection are used to determine the roles
of actor and recipient in a sentence. This mapping of cues to roles is
investigated in both first and second language learners of the English,
the English, Dutch and German languages.
The model proposes that the order in which mappings are acquired is
determined by how informative, or valid a particular cue is over all
sentences in a language. The model also proposes that the strength
of the mappings is determined by exposure to sentences that contain
conflicting cues, and eventually asymptotes to the relative cue validities
given by these conflict sentences. The model accounts for both first and
second language learners&apos; performance by having first language learners
start acquisition with initial mapping strengths of zero, while second
language learners start with initial strengths corresponding to those of their
first language.
Quantitative predictions about both the order of cue mapping and final
strengths are made on the basis of estimates of overall and conflict
sentence cue validity.
Two experiments then test these predictions in NVN sentences, rela-
tive clauses and dative constructions. In the first experiment, monolingual
speakers of English and Dutch ranging from kindergarteners to college
students interpret sentences containing different combinations of conflict-
ing and non-conflicting cues to role assignment. Qualitative and quantita-
tive predictions about the order and final strength of the mappings are
confirmed.
Using the same paradigm, the second experiment investigates cue
mapping in adult bilingual speakers of English, Dutch and German.
Results show that second language learners gradually shift their cue-map-
ping strengths from those appropriate to their first language to those
appropriate to the second using the same process as first language learners.
The proposed model fits the data better than several alternative
models.

This dissertation addresses the design of mechanical components, and
views design as a problem-solving activity. A previously presented theory
is adopted, modified, extended and tested. The extended theory explains
explains the activity of a human designer when solving a design problem. The
AIR-CYL expert system embodies the extended theory. The system
designs a type of Air-cylinder to user given requirements. The behavior
of the system closely follows the human designer&apos;s.
This research applies to a class of design which requires that at every
stage of the design the designer knows both what sequencesof design
steps are appropriate and also what knowledge is required. The theory
used hypothesizes that such activity is organized around a hierarchy of
active concepts which may be considered to be specialists about some
portion of the design. The hierarchy reflects the way that the designer
thinks of the object, and shapes the design process.
Each Specialist has its own set of Plans from which to select. The
plans request designs from other specialists lower in the hierarchy, and use
Tasks to make small additions to the design. Tasks use Steps to decide the
values of attributes. Constraints test the validity of the design. The
Design Data-base contains the current state of the design and a record of
its progress, plus the collected requirements from the user. Design
proceeds by obtaining and checking requirements, and by doing rough-de-
sign to establish whether full design is worth pursuing. If the rough-design
succeeds, then the full design is attempted. Communication between
design agents is done by passing messages that give instructions and report
on success or failure.
On design failure, suggestions lead to a redesign phase, where every
implicated agent attempts to alter the design in order to recover from the
failure. This results in dependency-based backup within chronological
backup.
Design knowledge expressed in a design language and some implemen-
tation details are presented. Other design related research is examined.
Some theory and implementation strengths and weaknesses conclude the
dissertation.
A general decision support system based on first-order logic with desir-
able characteristics (like being semistructured, supporting, descriptive,
effective, and evolutionary) will be presented. The proposed system
improves the existing frameworks of Sprague and Bonczek, Holsapple,

and Whinston in terms of flexibility and efficiency. A tool called the
connection graph is used as a basis for pre-compiling queries for efficient
response as well as for modifying pre-compiled queries in response to
assumption analysis (such as handling &amp;quot;what-if&amp;quot; type of questions).
Techniques for modifying the existing programs derived from the
connection graph are described. The notion of determined variables is
extended to include the case of process literals. The class of allowable
formulas is extended to include constraint formulas, which may include
existential quantifiers.
Office activities involve the sharing of a large quantity and variety of
stored information. Consequently computer-based systems for managing
office information (referred to as office information systems) demand a
specification of the structure and organization of information present
within the system. Current database management systems and their
underlying data models lack the flexibility required by office information
systems.
In this thesis a data model for the specification of data structures,
operations, and constraints relevant to office information systems is
presented. The model relies on techniques from conceptual data modelling
to specify the structure and semantics of common office objects. The
unusual features of the model include a constraint mechanism based on
triggers, templates for presenting objects in different media, and unformat-
ted data types such as text and audio. The representation of the office
environment is described. An example is given of a high-level interface for
which user commands can be translated to model operations.
Software Engineering can be viewed as the production of a series of
models beginning with a completely world-oriented (application-oriented)
model and progressing toward models that are more and more machine-
oriented. In this view, the first model in the series, referred to in the
thesis as a requirements model, captures and formalizes information that
is usually left informal in current approaches. A language for require
modeling (RML) has been designed. It is based on knowledge represen-
tation ideas from Artificial Intelligence (Al): a model in RML is consid-
ered as a knowledge base about some slice of reality. RML was designed
as part of the Taxis Project at the University of Toronto and is based on
the same framework as the Taxis language for information system design.
It offers three kinds of objects (entity, activity, and assertion) for repres-
enting concepts and three abstraction principles (aggregation, classifica-
tion, and generalization) for organizing objects. RML is formally defined
by giving a translation of each of its features into a First-Order Logic with
time. The notion of consistency of a requirements model is thus linked to
consistency of the corresponding set of FOL axioms. Among other exam-
ples of RML usage, the language is used to describe the organizing of an
IFIP working conference. A connection between informal &amp;quot;box-and-
arrow&amp;quot; descriptive techniques and a formal semantic model is drawn by
linking RML to a well-known requirements aid, SADT.
This thesis explores the idea of learning efficient strategies for solving
problems by searching for macro-operators. A macro-operator, or macro
for short, is simply a sequence of operators chosen from the primitive
operators provided by a problem. The technique is particularly useful for
problems with non-serializable subgoals, such as Rubik&apos;s Cube, for which
other weak methods fail. Both a problem solving program and a learning
program are described in detail. The performance of these programs is
analyzed in terms of the number of macros required to solve all problem

instances, the length of the resulting solutions expressed as the number of
primitive moves, and the amount of time necessary to learn the macros. In
addition, a theory of why the method works, and a characterization of the
range of problems for which it is useful are presented. The theory intro-
duces a new type of problem structure called operator decomposability.
Finally, it is concluded that the macro technique is a valuable addition to
the class of weak methods, that macro-operators constitute an interesting
and important type of knowledge, and that searching for macros may be a
useful general learning paradigm.

Learning to problem solve requires acquiring multiple forms of know-
ledge. Problem solving is viewed as a search of a state-space formulation
of a problem. With this formalism, operators are applied to states to
transit from the initial state to the goal state. The learning task to acquire
knowledge of the state-space to guide search. In particular, three forms
of knowledge are required: why each operator is useful, when to apply
each operator, and what each operator does. A PROLOG implementa-
tion, named PET, demonstrates the learning approach in the domains of
simultaneous linear equations and symbolic integration.
Episodic learning is a technique for learning why individual operators
are useful in a solution path. Episodic learning acquires generalized opera-
tor sequences which achieve the goal state. This is done by backing-up
state evaluation and learning sub-goals in the state-space.
Perturbation is a technique for learning when individual operators are
useful. Perturbation guides the generalization process to discover minimal-
ly-constrained preconditions for useful operator applications. This done by
experimentation, thereby reducing the teacher&apos;s role in the learning proc-
ess.
Learning relational models is a technique for discovering what individ-
ual operators do. Relational models are an explicit representation of the
transformation performed by operators. This representation enables the
learning element to reason with operator semantics to guide further learn-
ing.
Episodic learning, perturbation and relational models form an inte-
grated approach for learning problem solving. The approach demonstrates
self-teaching by reasoned experimentation.
A system (PSNET) is described that implements a semantic network in
simulated neurally plausible hardware. It is shown how knowledge repre-
sentation constructs can be reduced to aspects of a parallel associative
memory model.
The PSNET system is used to demonstrate how information can be
quickly accessed in very large knowledge-bases. PSNET is also used as a
tool to study how the internal structure of a concept can affect its associa-
tive interactions with other concepts.
PSNET is composed of a number of subsystems that exist at different
descriptive levels. Each subsystem is described along with its relations to
those at adjacent levels. The top-level subsystem is a structured inheri-
tance hierarchy that provides a formalism for the representation of real-
world knowledge. A logical level network is used to represent the
propositional content of the top-level semantic network links Logical
level links and nodes are in turn represented by associative matrix terms
and state vectors at the associative memory level. Finally, associative
memory data structures are interpreted as describing the state of a system
of model neurons at the neural network level.
At the neural network level, PSNET concepts are implemented as
distributed patterns of neural activity, which are represented by state

vectors. The use of a particular state vector representation of concepts
(i.e., the overlapping state vector representation) for automating property
inheritance and inductive generalization in semantic networks is discussed.
Three computer simulations that illustrate how low-level state vector
codings of semantic network nodes can influence the results of memOry
retrieval processes are described. The first simulation shows how the over-
lapping state vector representation generalizes properties explicitly predi-
cated of a category&apos;s exemplars to apply to the category itself. Simulation
2 shows that the structure acquired by a category, due to the overlapping
representation, is prototypical in nature. That is, a category&apos;s description
reflects the frequencies with which properties appear among its exemplars.
The third simulation shows how a category&apos;s description can also be
acquired by inductive generalization from the properties of its siblings in
an inheritance hierarchy.
PSNET&apos;s parallel processing mechanisms are explored in detail. It is
shown how (a) multiple access, (b) divergence, and (c) chain parallel proc-
essing occur in PSNET. A new synaptic modification rule is proposed that
causes PSNET to exhibit divergent fan-effects similar to those found
human subjects.

This study explored inductive discovery of condition-action rules. It&apos;s
goals were: to identify behaviors associated with skilled rule discovery, to
examine the relations between rule discovery and academic achievement
and other reasoning abilities, and to determine the affect of selected task
variables (rule presentation order and rule type) on rule discovery.
The rule discovery task was a variant of the card game Eleusis.
Subjects were to discover the rule that created a card pattern (e.g., If the
last card legally played was a face card, play a card of a different color.
If the last card legally played was not a face card, play a card of the same
color). Fifty high school seniors attempted to discover three Eleusis rules;
rule presentation order was counterbalanced across subjects.
Analyses of subjects&apos; verbal protocols indicated that Eleusis rule
discovery is a generate and test process that is modified by task-specific
heuristics. The most skilled subjects used very effective data-dependent
heuristics based on specific knowledge relating card patterns (data) and
rules. Less skilled subjects also attempted to use card pattern data to guide
their rule generation; they were relatively unsuccessful in this, though,
because they did not associate specific pieces of data with rule character-
istics. A follow-up study supported this analysis of skilled performance.
Less skilled subjects instructed in components of skilled rule discovery
were significantly more successful is discovering a subsequent rule than
less skilled subjects who were not so instructed.
The relation between Eleusis rule discovery and other cognitive skills
and aptitudes, including academic achievement, inductive reasoning, and
cognitive restructuring, were also assessed. The most striking result was
that the most skilled subjects had significantly higher mathematics achieve-
ment than all other subjects. A discriminant analysis indicated that
academic achievement variables were the best predictors of general rule
discovery skill, and that mathematics and science achievement in particular
distinguished the most skilled subjects from the successful but less skilled
ones. Academic achievement is not a sufficient predictor, however; factors
such as inductive reasoning ability and attitudes toward logic puzzles also
appear to be involved.
This dissertation presents an objection to Wittgenstein&apos;s concept of fami-
ly resemblances, three possible solutions to the objection, evaluations of
the solutions, and a sketch of Wittgenstein&apos;s approach to the objection.

My thesis is that none of the three proposed solutions is satisfactory, but
that Wittgenstein can deal with the objection.
Chapter I presents*the Problem of the Under-Determination of Exten-
sion, the claim that family resemblances are not enough to explain the
extension of a concept, since resemblances may be postulated between
cases falling under different concepts.
Chapters II and III discuss three solutions proposed by commentators
on family resemblances. The Basic Predicates Solution claims that points
of family resemblance are sufficient conditions, and is incorrect since Witt-
genstein denies that one can infer the applicability of a concept based on
the presence of a resemblance to an instance of the concept. The Simple
Properties Solution claims that only some concepts are family resemblance
concepts, and depend upon concepts which are not family resemblance
concepts, and is incorrect, since Wittgenstein does not require that family
resemblance concepts be reducible to non-family resemblance concepts.
The Bi-Directional Determination of Concepts Solution is the claim that a
concept is determined by an interaction between facts about cases
subsumed under it, and needs and purposes of language-users. This
solution is non-Wittgensteinian by ignoring the ramifications of his
concepts of grammar and language-games.
Chapter IV argues that Wittgenstein deals with the original objection
by developing new models for understanding language, involving the
concepts of grammar and language-games.
The most important problem is philosophical deontic logic is to determine
the logical form of expressions of conditional obligation. The dissertation
shows first that this problem is closely related to David Lewis&apos;s well-
known &amp;quot;problem about permission&amp;quot; — a problem concerning the charac-
terization of changes in normative systems. The dissertation contains a
solution to the problem about permission, as well as an argument that
expressions of conditional obligation cannot be represented satisfactorily
by means of some combination of monadic deontic operators and a coun-
terfactual conditional (which suggests that dyadic deontic operators cannot
be decomposed).
Lewis formulates the problem about permission in terms of a language
game for imperative and permission sentences. In order to solve the prob-
lem it is necessary first to point out the shortcoming in Lewis&apos;s game that it
cannot be used satisfactorily to provide semantics for &amp;quot;contrary to duty&amp;quot;
imperatives. Having revised the game it is possible to define the concept
of relative defeasibility between imperatives. It is in terms of this concept
that a solution to the problem about permission is formulated.
The &amp;quot;revised game&amp;quot; is used as well to discuss problems concerning
reasoning from sets of rules, principles, and facts to &amp;quot;all things considered&amp;quot;
conclusions. It is argued that two distinct senses or uses of &apos;ought&apos; must be
distinguished in order to represent such reasoning satisfactorily. The role
of the notion ceteris paribus is discussed. The notion is given a precise
definition in terms of the possible worlds semantics of the &amp;quot;revised game&amp;quot;
and it is argued that the notion is not as significant in normative reasoning
as commonly is supposed. An alternative notion is defined and defended.
The dissertation is a study of the relations between individual things,
parts of individual things, and boundaries. In first chapter I present an
expanded system of axioms and definitions for the primitive mereological
relation &amp;quot;x is a part of y&amp;quot;. I discuss alternatives to some of the axioms,
particularly the axiom of mereological essentialism, i.e. the view that
things have their parts essentially. I also give axioms and definitions that

characterize the relations between three dimensional objects and their
boundaries. I argue that boundaries are ontologically dependent partic-
ulars in that they cannot exist apart from or independently of three dimen-
sional objects.
In the second chapter I discuss conjunctivism, i.e. the thesis that for
any two discrete objects there is something made up of those two objects.
I develop several different forms of conjunctivism, including what I
describe as the conjunctivism of heaps. I consider several arguments for
and against conjunctivism and conclude that none of them offer convincing
grounds for either accepting or rejecting it.
In the third chapter I suggest that one way to decide between different
mereological principles is via an examination of the problem of identity
through time. I argue that a widely held theory of identity, the sortal theo-
ry, multiplies entities beyond what is needed to give an adequate account
of identity. I then propose a strictly mereological view of identity. This
view has the consequence that all individuals, other than boundaries and
monads, are mereological sums, and that the only non-universal properties
individuals have necessarily are those implied by mereological principles.

One aspect of school success is children&apos;s ability to make inferences from
reading material. Most research has focused on making inferences from
small sets of sentences or from fictional prose (e.g., Paris &amp; Lindauer,
1976; Thorndyke, 1976). However, only one study (Pearson, Hansen, &amp;
Gordon, 1977) has utilized nonfictional prose to assess how subjects&apos;
prior knowledge of material affected their ability to make inferences from
it. This study extended Pearson et al. by comparing subjects at different
grades with different types of nonfictional content.
Twenty-four females from each of three grades (third, sixth, and
eighth) were evenly divided among three content areas (procedural,
science, and social science). Each subject read two 400-word articles on
topics related to her content area. One article was on a topic the subject
knew well (as evidenced by a multiple-choice pretest), while the other was
on a topic not known well. After reading each article, the subjects were
orally presented with six questions assessing material explicitly presented in
the article and six questions requiring subjects to make an inference to
answer. The information required to answer each explicit question was
also necessary to answer one of the inference questions. Both passage
order and question order were controlled by counterbalancing.
Analyses of variance were conducted on two dependent variables: (a)
the percentage of correct responses to the explicit and inference questions,
and (b) the logarithms of the response times (RTs) to the questions. As
expected, the percent correct increased with age. In addition, the proce-
dural articles were easier than the science articles, which were easier than
the social science. While high knowledge articles were easier than low
knowledge in both the science and social science conditions, no such
difference was found for the procedural articles. In general, the greater the
percent correct, the faster the response times to the questions. Contrary to
prediction, there was no difference in percent correct between the explicit
and inference questions; however, the latter had significantly longer RTs
than the former questions.
These results support various schema theories of knowledge (e.g.,
Rumelhart &amp; Ortony, 1977). In general, questions on topics for which
subjects had a schema (high knowledge) were answered more quickly and
accurately. Some schemas (e.g., the procedural-cooking) seemed general
enough for subjects to use for answering questions about both familiar and
unfamiliar topics. In addition, the longer RTs to inference questions indi-

cate that such inferences require more processing. The educational impli-
cations of these data were also discussed.

Cognitive approaches to experimental and social psychology hold that
people come to understand the world through cognitive structures, or
schemas. Although much research has been conducted on how these
schemas influence information processing, much less has been conducted
on two equally important problems: (1) What are the factors that deter-
mine whether any given schema will be activated or primed?, and (2)
How do schemas influence meaningful social behavior? The two exper-
iments reported here addressed these problems.
to prime conceptions of helping. Some of these articles were designed
to prime the schema for helping people. Other articles were designed to
prime the schema for helping science. Next, subjects were given an oppor-
tunity to either help a person (assist a person walking up the stairs on
crutches) or help science (volunteers for additional psychology exper-
iments). Subjects were not aware that the helping task had anything to do
with the experiment. Even so, the priming articles had a significant and
specific effect on behavior. For example, an article that was designed to
prime the science helping schema served to enhance volunteering, but did
not influence helping the person. Moreover, it was found that priming the
schema through a persona was particularly effective in enhancing schema-
relevant behavior. In addition to enhancing behavior, the priming articles
also enhanced the correlation between attitudes and behavior. These find-
ings have implications for research that attempts to determine the nature
and content of schemas, and suggests that future approaches to cognitive
social psychology should explore the relationship between schemas and
social behavior.
