here, but I am dubious of the effectiveness of trying to
incorporate a crash course in linguistic fundamentals
into a course in CL. To be fair, I also think that logic at
a level that Allen presupposes (and that linguists do not
automatically acquire as a part of their training) ought to
be required, too, plus some formal language and autom-
ata theory.
At a level of fine detail, there are a number of glitches
of various kinds, ranging from solecisms like confusion
of term and referent (e.g.: &amp;quot;For example, the NP the
fish is ambiguous between being a single fish and being
many fish&amp;quot; (p.11)) to badly chosen examples. As an
instance of the latter I offer the sentence It&apos;s impossible
for you to have seen the moon in our car, because it
wouldn&apos;t fit, given on p.256 as a case of an inherently
anomalous NP (the moon in our car) losing its anomaly
in context. I would have thought that the sentence in
question shows how world knowledge would enable one
to know that the sequence the moon in our car was not
an NP in this context, or at least not one in which the
prepositional phrase functions as a restrictive modifier
of the head (in which case the anomaly is not there to
begin with). I would add, less as a criticism than as a
suggestion for amplification in a later edition (which
may well come about), that the discussion on non-
intersective adjectives on p. 291f take into account the
extensive treatment of the semantics of such items to be
found in Keenan and Faltz (1985). Finally, I should
mention that numerous pages of the copy I received had
large black smudges in the margins.
The foregoing reservations aside, I think that this is a
good effort at a systematic and comprehensive introduc-
tion to the field of CL.

I. I do, however, disagree with the following remark: &amp;quot;It is impor-
tant to realize that you do not store features and make agreement
checks just so that you can detect illegal sentences. Making
judgements on grammar is not a goal of computational linguistics&amp;quot;
p. 10. Systems like CRITIQUE, ne EPISTLE (Heidorn et al.
1982) are intended to do precisely that (among other things).
2. I have a stylistic quibble with Allen&apos;s reference on p. 178 to Mitch
[sic] Marcus; full names should be used in formal exposition.
3. I use quotes here since, strictly speaking, production would be a
better term. The word generate in its technical sense really means
nothing more than &amp;quot;define&amp;quot;, and its use as a synonym for produce
merely perpetuates ancient conceptual confusions.

This short book describes an implemented natural lan-
guage system called Cleopatra, which, in its 7,000 lines
of Franz Lisp, seeks to provide an interface for use in a
CAD system. Since the existing application involves
circuit design, the work is reminiscent of the SOPHIE
system (Brown and Burton 1975). An example sentence
that illustrates the level of sophistication toward which
Cleopatra strives is, &amp;quot;What is the voltage at n13 after
the voltage at n1 reaches 2 v and before the voltage at
n23 reaches 3 v?&amp;quot; Most of the book discusses the
system&apos;s treatment of syntax, in accordance with the
finding that &amp;quot;the pragmatics and the semantics required
for as limited a sub-domain as ours are very small
subsets of the pragmatics and semantics required gen-
erally&amp;quot;.
Cleopatra is predicated on the belief that &amp;quot;the design
of a natural language interface for CAD cannot be based
on prior assumptions about which English constructions
will be useful&amp;quot; and the further suggestion that &amp;quot;the
complexity and diversity of the CAD domain. . . render
previous approaches to natural language interfaces of
little practical utility for our purposes.&amp;quot; From the
evidence supplied in the book, however, I remain to be
convinced that the subset of the CAD domain addressed
to date is in fact more complex or more diverse than
what has been studied and reported on in the literature.
Neither do I believe the techniques presented, though
interesting in their own right, render the chosen domain
more approachable than a thoughtful attempt at using
existing techniques would have.

To provide some details, Cleopatra&apos;s parsing is &amp;quot;lex-
ically driven&amp;quot; in that &amp;quot;each word in the input sentence
invokes procedures that direct the parsing process&amp;quot;.
Samad observes that &amp;quot;we can invoke any arbitrary
function when evaluating a constraint&amp;quot;. Similarly, the
integration procedures that build meaning structures
may also involve &amp;quot;arbitrary Lisp functions&amp;quot;.
Cleopatra attacks ambiguity by use of &amp;quot;confidence
levels&amp;quot; related to such phenomena as &amp;quot;the relative
frequencies of occurrence of different senses of a word,
the likelihood of particular structures, and the corre-
spondence of conjuncts&amp;quot;. Parsing is viewed as a parallel
process, but the author clearly and honestly states that
the existing program is breadth-first.
While the author claims to have achieved a &amp;quot;sharp
contrast to the limited domains of previous natural
language interfaces&amp;quot;, I cannot concur. Although he
does handle certain issues in greater detail than have
most previous systems (for example, time references
and some types of conjunction), there are also, as he so
often and honestly admits, many typical distinctions
that have been largely ignored (apparently, without
suffering a great loss). For example, the system &amp;quot;is not
very sophisticated about auxiliaries or adverbs&amp;quot; and
does not yet &amp;quot;know about&amp;quot; person or number.
Samad suggests that the &amp;quot;final determinant&amp;quot; of a
system with the practical aspirations of his is the
evaluation it receives from its intended users. But his
claim that &amp;quot;Cleopatra is more than a vehicle to demon-
strate the feasibility of our ultimate goal. It is a useful
CAD tool&amp;quot; is simply not substantiated. Although &amp;quot;we
are confident that experimental studies will confirm the
utility of Cleopatra&amp;quot;, there&apos;s no indication that such
investigations have been conducted.
In conclusion, the author is to be commended for his
interest in building a complete system that can be used
for some meaningful purpose. His frank and honest
discussion of the details and limitations of his work are
also to be praised, and the presence of some inherently
interesting example sentences in the domain under
study should be mentioned. However. I find little in the
book that helps clarify any problems of language proc-
essing, nor do I suspect the techniques presented can
provide any &amp;quot;value added&amp;quot; over what&apos;s available from
existing literature. I am also disappointed by the fact
that most of the book concerns implementational issues
discussed at the level of data structures. Although I
cannot recommend the book as a text, it could certainly
be found useful as a case study.
