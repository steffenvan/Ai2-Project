Guidelines for Submissions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.968195789473684">
Manuscripts submitted to COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS should be typed on letter-size
paper (8.5 by 11 inches, or A4), double-spaced throughout, including footnotes and
references. The paper should begin with an informative abstract of approximately
150-250 words. Manuscripts must be submitted in English.
Submissions may be made in any of the following categories:
PAPER: This category includes contributions that report significant new research results in
computational linguistics or that provide critical reviews of the literature on a particular
topic. The length of a paper depends on its content, but we suggest that manuscripts be
limited to forty double-spaced pages. That is the equivalent of twelve journal pages.
Each paper is fully refereed, being read by at least two members of the editorial board and
usually by an additional expert in the particular subject area.
The submission of an article to CL for refereeing means that the author certifies the
manuscript is not copyrighted; nor has it been published or submitted for publication to
another refereed journal. If any version of the paper has appeared, or will appear, in a
non-refereed publication, the details of such publication must be made known to the
Editor at the time of submission. The final version of a paper tentatively accepted for
publication must be accompanied by a Copyright Transfer Agreement signed by all of the
authors or, in the case of a &amp;quot;work for hire&amp;quot;, by the employer. This written transfer is
necessary under the 1978 U.S. Copyright law.

<listItem confidence="0.647300125">
TECHNICAL CORRESPONDENCE: This category includes short articles reporting
preliminary results of some project in progress, or the results of other studies of interest
to the readership. Technical correspondences should not generally exceed eight double-
spaced pages. Each technical correspondence is reviewed by at least two members of the
editorial board before acceptance.
LETTERS TO THE EDITOR: This includes statements of opinion on issues relevant to the
readership. The Editor and the editorial board will evaluate the appropriateness of these
contributions for inclusion.
