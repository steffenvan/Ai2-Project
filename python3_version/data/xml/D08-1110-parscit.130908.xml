Code-switching is an interesting linguistic
phenomenon commonly observed in highly
bilingual communities. It consists of mixing
languages in the same conversational event.
This paper presents results on Part-of-Speech
tagging Spanish-English code-switched dis-
course. We explore different approaches to
exploit existing resources for both languages
that range from simple heuristics, to language
identification, to machine learning. The best
results are achieved by training a machine
learning algorithm with features that combine
the output of an English and a Spanish Part-
of-Speech tagger.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999837846153846">
Worldwide the percentage of bilingual speakers is
fairly large, and it keeps increasing at a high rate.
In the U.S., 18% of the total population speaks a
language other than English at home, the major-
ity of which speaks Spanish (U.S. Census Bureau,
2003). A significant percentage of this Spanish-
English bilingual population code-switch between
the two languages in what is often referred as Span-
glish, the mix of Spanish and English. Spanish
and English are not the only occurrence of language
mixtures. Examples of other popular combinations
include Arabic dialects, French and German, Span-
ish and Catalan, Maltese and English, and English
and French. Typically when there are linguistic bor-
ders, or when the country has more than one official
language, we can find instances of code-switching.
Despite the wide use of code-switched discourse
among bilinguals, this linguistic phenomenon has
received little attention in the fields of Natural Lan-
guage Processing and Computational Linguistics.
Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging is a well studied prob-
lem in these fields. For languages such as English,
German, Spanish, and Chinese there are several dif-
ferent POS taggers that reach high accuracies, espe-
cially in news text corpora. However, to our knowl-
edge, there is no previous work on developing a POS
tagger for text with mixes of languages.
In this paper we present results on the problem
of POS tagging English-Spanish code-switched dis-
course by taking advantage of existing taggers for
both languages. This rationale follows the evi-
dence from studies of code-switching on different
language pairs, which have shown code-switching
to be grammatical according to both languages be-
ing switched. We use different heuristics to combine
POS tag information from existing monolingual tag-
gers. We also explore the use of different language
identification methods to select POS tags from the
appropriate monolingual tagger. However, the best
results are achieved by a machine learning approach
using features generated by the monolingual POS
taggers.
The next section presents the facts about code-
switching, including some previous work done
mainly in linguistics. Then in Section 3 we dis-
cuss previous work related to the automated pro-
cessing of code-switched discourse. In Section 4
we describe the English-Spanish code-switched data
set gathered for the experimental evaluation. Sec-
tion 5 presents the heuristics-based approaches for
POS tagging that we explored. In Section 6 we

2 Rules of Code-switching
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998723">
In the linguistic, sociolinguistic, psychology, and
psycholinguistic literature, bilingualism and the in-
herent phenomena it exhibits have been studied
for nearly a century (Espinosa, 1917; Ervin and
Osgood, 1954; Gumperz, 1964; Gumperz and
Hernandez-Chavez, 1971; Gumperz, 1971; Sankoff,
1968; Lipski, 1978). Despite the numerous previ-
ous studies of linguistic characteristics of bilingual-
ism, there is no clear consensus on the terminol-
ogy related to language alternation patterns in bilin-
gual speakers. The alternation of languages within
a sentence is known as code-mixing, but it has
also been referred as intrasentential code-switching,
and intrasentential alternation (Poplack, 1980; Gros-
jean, 1982; Ardila, 2005). Alternation across sen-
tence boundaries is known as intersentential code-
switching, or just code-switching. In the rest of this
paper we will refer to the mixing of languages as
code-switching. When necessary, we will differen-
tiate the type of code-switching by referring to al-
ternations within sentences as intrasentential code-
switching and alternations across sentence bound-
aries as intersentential code-switching.
Linguistic phenomena in bilingual speakers have
been analyzed on different language pairs, includ-
ing English-French, English-Dutch, Finish-English,
Arabic-French, and Spanish-English, to name a few.
There is a general agreement that code-switched pat-
terns are not generated randomly; according to these
studies, they follow specific grammatical rules. Fur-
thermore, some studies suggest that, if these rules
are violated, the resulting discourse will sound un-
natural (Toribio, 2001b; Toribio, 2001a). The fol-
lowing shows the rules governing code-switching
discourse described in several studies (Poplack,
1980; Poplack, 1981; Sankoff, 1981; Sankoff,
1998a).

• Switches can take place only between full word
boundaries. This is also known as the free mor-
pheme constraint.
• Monolingual constructs within the sentence
will follow the grammatical rules of the mono-
lingual fragment.
• Permissible switch points are those that do not
violate the order of adjacent constituents on
both sides of the switch point of either of the
languages. This is called the equivalence con-
straint.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.996083166666667">
Although these rules are somewhat controversial,
and most of the studies on this area have been con-
ducted on small samples, we cannot ignore the fact
that patterns bearing the above rules have emerged in
different bilingual communities with different back-
grounds.

3 Automated Processing of Code-Switched
Discourse
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999977806451613">
A previous work related to the processing of code-
switched text deals with language identification
on English-Maltese code-switched SMS messages
(Rosner and Farrugia, 2007). In addition to deal-
ing with intrasentential code-switching, they have
to deal with text where misspellings and ad hoc
word contractions abound. What Rosner and Far-
rigua have found to work best for language identi-
fication in this noisy domain is a combination of a
bigram Hidden Markov Model, trained on language
transitions, and a trigram character Markov Model
for handling unknown words. In another related
work, Franco and Solorio present preliminary results
on training a language model for Spanish-English
code-switched text (Franco and Solorio, 2007). To
evaluate their language model, they asked a human
subject to judge sentences generated by a PCFG in-
duced from training data and the language model.
However, they only used one human judge.
Regarding the automated POS tagging and pars-
ing of code-mixed utterances there is little prior
work. To the best of our knowledge, there is no
parser, nor POS tagger, currently available for the
syntactic analysis of this type of discourse. There
are theoretical approaches that propose formalisms
to represent the structure of code-switched utter-
ances and describe a framework for parsing and gen-
erating mixed sentences, for example for Marathi
and English (Joshi, 1982), or Hindi and English
(Goyal et al., 2003). Sankoff proposed a production
model of bilingual discourse that accounts for the
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.9999572">
equivalence constraint and the unpredictability of
code-switching (Sankoff, 1998a; Sankoff, 1998b).
His real-time production model draws on the alter-
nation of fragments from two virtual monolingual
sentences. It also accounts for other types of code-
switching such as repetition-translation and inser-
tional code-switching. But no statistical assessment
has been conducted on real corpora.
Our goal is to develop a POS tagger for code-
switched utterances, which is the first step of the
syntactic analysis of any language. Among the chal-
lenges we face is the lack of a representative sam-
ple of code-mixed discourse. Most POS taggers are
built using large collections, usually at least a mil-
lion words, such as the Brown corpus (Kucera and
Francis, 1967), the Wall Street Journal corpus (Paul
and Baker, 1992), or the Switchboard corpus (God-
frey et al., 1992). Currently, there is no annotation
of code-switched text of comparable size. But in
contrast to the lack of linguistic resources available
for Spanish-English code-mixed discourse, English
and Spanish have sufficient resources, especially En-
glish. Thus, rather than starting from scratch, we
will draw on existing taggers for both languages,
which will reduce the amount of code-switched data
needed. Some examples of POS taggers that per-
form reasonably well on monolingual text of each
language can be found in (Brants, 2000; Brill, 1992;
Carreras and Padr´o, 2002; Charniak, 1993; Ratna-
parkhi, 1996; Schmid, 1994). However, these tools
are designed to work on monolingual text, therefore
if applied as they are to code-switched text, their ac-
curacy will decrease by a large margin. In the fol-
lowing sections we will explore different methods
for combining monolingual taggers.

Data collections that have instances of Spanish-
English code-switching, Spanglish for short, are not
easily found since code-switching is primarily used
in spoken form. To gather data we recorded a con-
versation among three staff members of a southwest
university in the U.S. The three speakers come from
a highly bilingual background and code-switch reg-
ularly when speaking among themselves, or other
bilingual speakers.

a human annotator. The annotations were later re-

agreement was measured. The POS tag set used in
the annotation is the combination of the tag sets from
the English and the Spanish Tree Taggers (see Sec-
tion 5). The vocabulary of the transcription has a to-
tal of 1,516 different word forms1. In the conversa-
tion a total of 239 switches were identified manually,
out of which 129 are intrasentential code-switches,
and the rest are intersentential. English is the pre-
dominant language used, with a total of 6,020 tokens
and 576 monolingual sentences. In contrast, the

5.1 Monolingual Taggers
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9988785">
We used the Tree Tagger (Schmid, 1994) for this
work because of the following considerations:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.997810347826087">
1. It has both English and Spanish versions. The
English tagger uses a slightly modified version of
the Penn Treebank tag set and was trained and eval-
uated on different portions of the Penn Treebank,
reaching a POS tagging accuracy of 96.36%. The
Spanish one uses a different tagset with 75 different
POS tags2 and was trained on the Spanish CRATER
corpus.
2. The transition probabilities are estimated using a
modified version of the ID3 decision tree algorithm
(Quinlan, 1986), which provides more freedom to
learn contextual cues than n-grams.
3. Both taggers include a special tag for foreign
words, PE for Spanish and FW for English. We do
not expect this tag to identify correctly all foreign
words, but when available this information will be
exploited.
4. The Tree tagger generates probability estimates
on the tags that can be used as features.
5. Finally, when the tagger fails to lemmatize a
word it outputs the special token (unknown). This
information can be used as a hint of words that do
not belong to that particular language.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.996796">
5.2 Heuristic-based Systems
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997209375">
For all heuristics the complete Spanglish data set
was given to both taggers as a single text, then the
final tag for each word was selected from the output
of the taggers according to the different heuristics.
Table 2 shows the tagging accuracies of the different
heuristics we explored, which are explained below.
1. Using the monolingual tagger. Here we simply
give the Spanglish text to the Spanish and the
English tree tagger. We expect from both taggers a
performance degradation due to the inclusion of for-
eign words in code-switching, as compared against
their accuracy on monolingual texts. Another
complicating factor to keep in mind is that we are
dealing with spoken language. Hesitations, fillers,
disfluencies, and interruption points, such as Umm,
Mmmhmm, and Uh-huh, are frequently observed in

speech and it is well known that they complicate
the POS tagging task. The tagging accuracy from
using the individual taggers is rather low, 26% for
the Spanish tagger and 54% for the English one.
The large difference between the two taggers can be
attributed to the fact that the majority of the words
in the corpus are in English.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.878223115384616">
2. Using confidence thresholds. The Tree Tagger
can output probabilities for each tag, showing the
confidence of the tagger on each particular tag. To
use this information we choose for each word the tag
from the tagger with the highest confidence. When
there is a tie we use either the English or the Spanish
tag. Table 2 shows the results for the two cases. The
“Highest prob tag or English” heuristic gives an ac-
curacy of 51%, which is almost as accurate as using
only the English tagger. The “Highest prob tag or
Spanish” achieves an accuracy of 49%, which is an
improvement over using only the monolingual Span-
ish tagger, but it is still below the accuracy of the En-
glish monolingual tagger. This is also possibly due
to the task being easier for the English tagger.
3. Combining confidence thresholds with knowl-
edge from special tags and lemmas. This heuristic
uses confidence thresholds combined with decisions
based on the special tags, described in Section 5.1,
and the unknown lemmas found. Let POSE(wi)
and POSS(wi) be the POS tags assigned to word
wi by the English and Spanish tagger respectively;
and let ProbE(wi) and ProbS(wi) be the confi-
dence scores of POS tags for word wi computed by
the English and Spanish tree taggers, respectively.
For each word wi in the text, the final POS tag,
</listItem>
<page confidence="0.9827">

<figure confidence="0.963610666666667">
POSF(wi), will be assigned as follows:
1. If POSE(wi) = FW, then POSF(wi) ←
POSS(wi)
2. Else if POSS(wi) = PE, then POSF(wi) ←
POSE(wi)
3. Else if POSE(wi) = (unknown), then
POSF(wi) ← POSS(wi)
4. Else if POSS(wi) = (unknown), then
POSF(wi) ← POSE(wi)
5. Else if ProbE(wi) &gt; ProbS(wi), then
POSF(wi) ← POSE(wi)
6. Else POSF(wi) ← POSS(wi)

<bodyText confidence="0.995085381818182">
This heuristic performs better than the other meth-
ods explored so far, yielding an accuracy of 64.27%.
It seems that knowledge of the taggers can be used
to improve results. However, POS tagging accuracy
is still poor.
4. Selecting POS tags based on automated language
identification. We used two different strategies for
automatically identifying the language at the word
level. One is based on dictionary look-up and the
other is character-based language models. For the
first approach, every word in the text is searched in
the English and Spanish dictionaries. If a word is
found in the English dictionary, then we identify that
word as belonging to English and the POS tags from
the English tagger are used for that word and the
following ones, until a word is found in the Span-
ish dictionary. Similarly, for a word not found in
the English dictionary, but found in the Spanish dic-
tionary, we use the Spanish tags until an English
word is found. Note that this simple heuristic will
always label words that belong to both languages as
English, which is also the case for words not found
in either dictionary. This dictionary-based method
has a language identification accuracy of 94% on the
Spanglish corpus.
The character language models were trained on
the Agence France Presse (AFP) portions of the Gi-
gaword for English and Spanish, respectively. For
each of the words in the Spanglish corpus, we first
decide its language by choosing the one with the
lowest perplexity, calculated using character n-gram
language models, then we use the corresponding
POS tag. We experimented with different language
model orders, with n ranging from 2 to 6, and found
that we achieve the highest accuracy, 81.46%, on
POS tagging using a 5-gram language model. This
5-gram method reached a language identification ac-
curacy of 85% for the Spanglish corpus. However,
the language identification method using dictionary
look-up achieved the best POS tagging result so far:
86.03%. The Spanglish conversation is dominated
by every-day language that is easily found in dic-
tionaries, while the text used to train the charac-
ter based n-gram language models includes vocab-
ulary that is not commonly used in conversations.
This can explain why the simple dictionary look-
up approach yielded better results for our corpus.
Performing manual identification of the language
and sending to the appropriate tagger just the corre-
sponding fragments yields a very high POS tagging
accuracy, 89.72%. This shows that it is important
to deal with the language switches for boosting ac-
curacy. However relying on human annotated lan-
guage tags would be expensive and for some tasks
unfeasible.

From Table 2 we can see that, with the exception of
the language identification heuristic, accuracies are
low for the previous experiments. However, we be-
lieve that we can improve results further by using
Machine Learning (ML) algorithms trained specif-
ically for this task. In this section we describe the
ML setting and present a comparison of the differ-
ent algorithms we tested.

6.1 Approach

<bodyText confidence="0.999239545454545">
The key point is that the features selected for de-
scribing the learning instances are the output from
the English and the Spanish taggers. This scheme
is similar to a stacked classifier approach (Wolpert,
1992), where the final classifier takes as input the
predictions made by the different learners on the first
pass and is trained to select the right tag from them,
or a different one if the right answer is not available.
The gold-standard POS tags are used as the
class label, and instances in this learning task are
described by the following attributes:

Feature 1 is just the lexical word form as it ap-

language identification approach together with the
oracle accuracy. The oracle is the accuracy achieved
when always selecting the right POS tag, when it
is available, from the output of both Tree Taggers.
We did not expect the oracle’s accuracy to be an up-
per bound on the accuracy for the ML learning al-
gorithm. Our intuition is that the ML algorithm can
be trained to identify when the taggers have made
a mistake and what the right answer should be. As
the results show, the ML approach can indeed out-
perform the oracle, and the language identification
method.
In Figure 1 we show the effect of the amount
of training data on the accuracy using Logit Boost.
We selected Logit Boost for this and the follow-
ing experiments since its accuracy is comparable to
SVMs but it is computationally less expensive. We
randomly partitioned the transcription into 10 sub-
groups. Then we used one subgroup as the test set
and the rest for training. Starting with one subgroup
in the training set, we incrementally added one sub-
group to the training set and evaluate the tagging
performance of the test set. We repeated this pro-
cess several times, choosing randomly a new test set
each time. The percentages shown are the average
over all the experiments. With only 10% of the sen-
tences for training we are reaching very good accu-
racy already, as high as that from the strategy based

60% of the training data is used. We do not gain
much by adding more training data after this.
Results shown in Table 3 demonstrate that POS
tagging can be learned effectively based on the at-
tributes described in Subsection 6.1, even if we are
not explicitly adding contextual information. To de-
termine the extent to which each attribute is con-
tributing to the learning task, we performed another
set of experiments where we selected different sub-
sets of the attributes. Table 4 shows the results with
Logit Boost. Overall, the attributes taken from the
English POS tagger are more valuable for this learn-
ing task. If we only take the word form and the fea-
tures from the English Tree tagger (first row in Ta-
ble 4) we are reaching an accuracy that outperforms
all heuristics. Still, there is some valuable infor-
mation provided by the Spanish POS tagger output
since the highest accuracy is achieved by including
the Spanish-based attributes in combination with the
English-based ones. Surprisingly, we can manage to
outperform the oracle by using only three attributes:
the lexical word form and the POS tags from the
English and Spanish tagger (see row 7 in table), or
the POS tags from the monolingual taggers together
with the lemma from the Spanish tagger (see row 4
from bottom to top). We also experimented adding
as an attribute the output of the language identifica-
tion method, but found no significant changes in the
accuracy.

7 Discussion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999965486486487">
We analyzed the different results gathered through
the experiments and we present here the most rele-
vant insights.
The first discovery, is that a lot of the errors made
by the oracle, and the other methods as well, are due
to the difficulties inherent in dealing with sponta-
neous speech where fillers, interruption points, hes-
itations, and the like abound. About as much as
20% of the errors made by the oracle are due to
these features. Another roughly 20% is due to un-
known tokens in the transcription, such as mum-
bling, slang words such as “gonna” and “wanna”,
or other sounds unintelligible for the human tran-
scriber. For the rest of the analysis we decided to
ignore these types of mistakes for all methods and
focus only on the remaining mistakes. In the case
of the oracle we are left with 445 erroneously POS
tagged words. From those, about 50%, or 233 to
be exact, are errors in sentences with code-switches.
We consider this to be a strong indication of the
complexity that intrasentential switches add to the
task of POS tagging. For the taggers, these sentences
are incomplete, or ill-formed, since they have frag-
ments with foreign words and thus, they fail to iden-
tify them. The rest of the oracle mistakes can not be
attributable to a single cause. Some are fragmented
sentences, and some are due to errors inherent of the
tagger, but nothing is particulary salient about them.
The language identification methods share, of
course, the same mistakes made by the oracle, plus
342 more, for a total of 787 (in the case of the
dictionary-based language identification). The chal-
lenge of POS tagging code-switched text is more ev-
ident for this method. Out of the mistakes made by
the language identification method, 540 lie in sen-
tences with code-switching, that is, nearly 70% of
the mistakes. For 307 of these mistakes the right

POS tag was available from one of the taggers.
Some typical examples of these errors are words that
belong to both languages, such as “a”, “no”, “me”
and “con”.
The ML approach outperformed both the lan-
guage identification method and the oracle. Analyz-
ing the predictions made by SVM we verified that
out of the 445 errors made by the oracle, SVM cor-
rectly tagged 223, the majority of which are words in
sentences with code-switching (142 words). When
compared against the errors from the method based
on language identification, SVM correctly tagged
481 words out of the 787, 374 of which are words
in sentences with code-switches. In summary, the
ML approach is more robust to code-switched sen-
tences. Note that we did find some errors made by
the ML approach that are not shared by the oracle
or the language identification method, a total of 105.
Some of these mistakes are due to inconsistencies
on the human-annotated tags. For instance, in most
cases slang words such as “gonna” and “wanna” are
labeled as unknown words, but we found that these
words were labeled as verbs in a few cases. Not sur-
prisingly this caused the ML algorithm to fail, since
these class labels were misleading. The majority of
the mistakes, however, seem to be due to systematic
mistakes by the POS taggers.
One last remark is regarding our decision to find a
method for successfully exploiting the existing tag-
gers for POS tagging Spanglish text. Our origi-
nal motivation came from the lack of linguistic re-
sources to process Spanglish text. However, we did
train from scratch a sequential model for POS tag-
ging Spanglish, namely Conditional Random Fields
(CRFs) (Lafferty et al., 2001). We used MALLET
(McCallum, 2002) for this experiment and the same
training/testing partitions used in the experiment re-
ported in Table 3. The CRF POS tagger was trained
using capitalization information and the previous to-
ken as context. The average accuracy of this CRF
was 81%, which is lower than the language identifi-
cation heuristic. We believe that this low accuracy is
due to the lack of a representative sample of anno-
tated Spanglish. It will be interesting to see if when
more data becomes available the ML algorithms still
yield the best results.

8 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999972760869565">
Code-switching is a fresh and exciting research area
that has received little attention in the language pro-
cessing community. Research on this topic has many
interesting applications, including automatic speech
recognition, machine translation, and computer as-
sisted language learning. In this paper we present
preliminary work towards developing a POS tagger
for English-Spanish code-switched text that, to the
best of our knowledge, is the first effort towards this
end.
We explored different heuristics for taking advan-
tage of existing linguistic resources for English and
Spanish with unimpressive results. A simple word-
level language identification strategy outperformed
all heuristics tested. But the best results, even bet-
ter than the oracle, were achieved by using machine
learning using the output of monolingual POS tag-
gers as input features.
In the error analysis we showed that most of
the mistakes made by the language identification
method, and the oracle itself, occur in sentences with
intrasentential code-switching, showing the diffi-
culty of the task. In contrast, our machine learning
approach was less sensitive to the complexity of this
alternation pattern.
There is still a lot of work to do in this area. Our
ongoing efforts include gathering a larger corpus,
with different speakers and conversational styles, as
well as written forms of code-switching from blogs
and Internet forums. In addition, we are exploring
the use of context information. The features we are
currently using to represent each word do not take
into account the context surrounding the word. We
want to test if by using contextual features we can
further improve our results.
In this study we focused on code-switching, but
borrowing is another complex language alternation
pattern that we want the POS tagger to handle. We
are working on developing a special method for
identification and morphological analysis of borrow-
ings. This method will help increase the accuracy of
the POS tagger.
Spanish-English is not the only popular combi-
nation of languages. An interesting line of future
work would be to explore if the method presented
here can be adapted to different language combi-

code-switch among more than two codes and this
poses fascinating research challenges as well.

An in depth analysis of results is presented in Section 7, and we conclude this paper with a summary of the findings and directions for future work in Section 8. 2 Rules of Code-switching In the linguistic, sociolinguistic, psychology, and psycholinguistic literature, bilingualism and the inherent phenomena it exhibits have been studied for nearly a century (Espinosa, 1917; Ervin and Osgood, 1954; Gumperz, 1964; Gumperz and Hernandez-Chavez, 1971; Gumperz, 1971; Sankoff, 1968; Lipski, 1978). Despite the numerous previous studies of linguistic characteristics of bilingualism, there is no clear consensus on the terminology related to language alternation patterns in bilingual speakers. The alternation of languages within a sentence is known as code-mixing, but it has also been referred as intrasentential code-switching, and intrasentential alternation (Poplack, 1980; Grosjean, 1982; Ardila, 2005).

In addition to dealing with intrasentential code-switching, they have to deal with text where misspellings and ad hoc word contractions abound. What Rosner and Farrigua have found to work best for language identification in this noisy domain is a combination of a bigram Hidden Markov Model, trained on language transitions, and a trigram character Markov Model for handling unknown words. In another related work, Franco and Solorio present preliminary results on training a language model for Spanish-English code-switched text (Franco and Solorio, 2007). To evaluate their language model, they asked a human subject to judge sentences generated by a PCFG induced from training data and the language model. However, they only used one human judge. Regarding the automated POS tagging and parsing of code-mixed utterances there is little prior work. To the best of our knowledge, there is no parser, nor POS tagger, currently available for the syntactic analysis of this type of discourse.

Despite the numerous previous studies of linguistic characteristics of bilingualism, there is no clear consensus on the terminology related to language alternation patterns in bilingual speakers. The alternation of languages within a sentence is known as code-mixing, but it has also been referred as intrasentential code-switching, and intrasentential alternation (Poplack, 1980; Grosjean, 1982; Ardila, 2005). Alternation across sentence boundaries is known as intersentential codeswitching, or just code-switching. In the rest of this paper we will refer to the mixing of languages as code-switching. When necessary, we will differentiate the type of code-switching by referring to alternations within sentences as intrasentential codeswitching and alternations across sentence boundaries as intersentential code-switching.

It has both English and Spanish versions. The English tagger uses a slightly modified version of the Penn Treebank tag set and was trained and evaluated on different portions of the Penn Treebank, reaching a POS tagging accuracy of 96.36%. The Spanish one uses a different tagset with 75 different POS tags2 and was trained on the Spanish CRATER corpus. 2. The transition probabilities are estimated using a modified version of the ID3 decision tree algorithm (Quinlan, 1986), which provides more freedom to learn contextual cues than n-grams. 3. Both taggers include a special tag for foreign words, PE for Spanish and FW for English. We do not expect this tag to identify correctly all foreign words, but when available this information will be exploited. 4. The Tree tagger generates probability estimates on the tags that can be used as features. 5. Finally, when the tagger fails to lemmatize a word it outputs the special token (unknown). This information can be used as a hint of words that do not belong to that particular language. 5.2 Heuristic-based Systems For al</context>

The only parameter we modified was for J48 –we enabled the option for reducing error pruning. Table 3: POS tagging accuracy of Spanglish text with different Machine Learning algorithms. Oracle shows the accuracy achieved when always selecting the right POS tag from the output of both Tree Taggers.

But in contrast to the lack of linguistic resources available for Spanish-English code-mixed discourse, English and Spanish have sufficient resources, especially English. Thus, rather than starting from scratch, we will draw on existing taggers for both languages, which will reduce the amount of code-switched data needed. Some examples of POS taggers that perform reasonably well on monolingual text of each language can be found in (Brants, 2000; Brill, 1992; Carreras and Padr´o, 2002; Charniak, 1993; Ratnaparkhi, 1996; Schmid, 1994). However, these tools are designed to work on monolingual text, therefore if applied as they are to code-switched text, their accuracy will decrease by a large margin. In the following sections we will explore different methods for combining monolingual taggers. 4 Data Set Data collections that have instances of SpanishEnglish code-switching, Spanglish for short, are not easily found since code-switching is primarily used in spoken form.

Although these rules are somewhat controversial, and most of the studies on this area have been conducted on small samples, we cannot ignore the fact that patterns bearing the above rules have emerged in different bilingual communities with different backgrounds. 3 Automated Processing of Code-Switched Discourse A previous work related to the processing of codeswitched text deals with language identification on English-Maltese code-switched SMS messages (Rosner and Farrugia, 2007). In addition to dealing with intrasentential code-switching, they have to deal with text where misspellings and ad hoc word contractions abound. What Rosner and Farrigua have found to work best for language identification in this noisy domain is a combination of a bigram Hidden Markov Model, trained on language transitions, and a trigram character Markov Model for handling unknown words. In another related work, Franco and Solorio present preliminary results on training a language model for Spanish-English code-switched text (Franco and Solorio, 2007).

In the U.S., 18% of the total population speaks a language other than English at home, the majority of which speaks Spanish (U.S. Census Bureau, 2003). A significant percentage of this SpanishEnglish bilingual population code-switch between the two languages in what is often referred as Spanglish, the mix of Spanish and English. Spanish and English are not the only occurrence of language mixtures. Examples of other popular combinations include Arabic dialects, French and German, Spanish and Catalan, Maltese and English, and English and French. Typically when there are linguistic borders, or when the country has more than one official language, we can find instances of code-switching. Despite the wide use of code-switched discourse among bil</context>

We selected some of the most widely known algorithms, including Support Vector Machines (SVM) with a polynomial kernel of exponent one (Sch¨olkopf and Smola, 2002), Weka’s modified version of Quinlan’s C4.5 (J48) (Quinlan, 1986), Additive Logistic Regression with Decision Stumps (Logit Boost) (Friedman et al., 1998) and Naive Bayes. The only parameter we modified was for J48 –we enabled the option for reducing error pruning. Table 3: POS tagging accuracy of Spanglish text with different Machine Learning algorithms.

However, we believe that we can improve results further by using Machine Learning (ML) algorithms trained specifically for this task. In this section we describe the ML setting and present a comparison of the different algorithms we tested. 6.1 Approach The key point is that the features selected for describing the learning instances are the output from the English and the Spanish taggers. This scheme is similar to a stacked classifier approach (Wolpert, 1992), where the final classifier takes as input the predictions made by the different learners on the first pass and is trained to select the right tag from them, or a different one if the right answer is not available. The gold-standard POS tags are used as the class label, and instances in this learning task are described by the following attributes: 1055 1. The word (word) 2. English POS tag (Et) 3.
