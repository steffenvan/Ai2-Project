Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.99990575">
We apply pattern-based methods for collect-
ing hypernym relations from the web. We
compare our approach with hypernym ex-
traction from morphological clues and from
large text corpora. We show that the abun-
dance of available data on the web enables
obtaining good results with relatively unso-
phisticated techniques.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99986880952381">
WordNet is a key lexical resource for natural lan-
guage applications. However its coverage (currently
155k synsets for the English WordNet 2.0) is far
from complete. For languages other than English,
the available WordNets are considerably smaller,
like for Dutch with a 44k synset WordNet. Here, the
lack of coverage creates bigger problems. A man-
ual extension of the WordNets is costly. Currently,
there is a lot of interest in automatic techniques for
updating and extending taxonomies like WordNet.
Hearst (1992) was the first to apply fixed syn-
tactic patterns like such NP as NP for extracting
hypernym-hyponym pairs. Carballo (1999) built
noun hierarchies from evidence collected from con-
junctions. Pantel, Ravichandran and Hovy (2004)
learned syntactic patterns for identifying hypernym
relations and combined these with clusters built
from co-occurrence information. Recently, Snow,
Jurafsky and Ng (2005) generated tens of thousands
of hypernym patterns and combined these with noun
clusters to generate high-precision suggestions for
unknown noun insertion into WordNet (Snow et al.,
2006). The previously mentioned papers deal with
English. Little work has been done for other lan-
guages. IJzereef (2004) used fixed patterns to ex-
tract Dutch hypernyms from text and encyclopedias.
Van der Plas and Bouma (2005) employed noun dis-
tribution characteristics for extending the Dutch part
of EuroWordNet.
In earlier work, different techniques have been ap-
plied to large and very large text corpora. Today,
the web contains more data than the largest available
text corpus. For this reason, we are interested in em-
ploying the web for the extraction of hypernym re-
lations. We are especially curious about whether the
size of the web allows to achieve meaningful results
with basic extraction techniques.
In section two we introduce the task, hypernym
extraction. Section three presents the results of our
web extraction work as well as a comparison with
similar work with large text corpora. Section four
concludes the paper.

2 Task and Approach

We examine techniques for extending WordNets. In
this section we describe the relation we focus on,
introduce our evaluation approach and explain the
query format used for obtaining web results.

2.1 Task
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999970125">
We concentrate on a particular semantic relation:
hypernymy. One term is a hypernym of another if
its meaning both covers the meaning of the second
term and is broader. For example, furniture is a hy-
pernym of table. The opposite term for hypernym is
hyponym. So table is a hyponym of furniture. Hy-
pernymy is a transitive relation. If term A is a hyper-
nym of term B while term B is a hypernym of term

C then term A is also a hypernym of term C.
In WordNets, hypernym relations are defined be-
tween senses of words (synsets). The Dutch Word-
Net (Vossen, 1998) contains 659,284 of such hy-
pernym noun pairs of which 100,268 are immedi-
ate links and 559,016 are inherited by transitivity.
More importantly, the resource contains hypernym
information for 45,979 different nouns. A test with
a Dutch newspaper text revealed that the WordNet
only covered about two-thirds of the noun lemmas
in the newspaper (among the missing words were
e-mail, euro and provider). Proper names pose an
even larger problem: the Dutch WordNet only con-
tains 1608 words that start with a capital character.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999888">
2.2 Collecting evidence
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999821">
In order to find evidence for the existence of hyper-
nym relations between words, we search the web for
fixed patterns like H such as A, B and C. Following
Snow et al. (2006), we derive two types of evidence
from these patterns:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9994065">
• H is a hypernym of A, B and C
• A, B and C are siblings of each other
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.983409333333333">
Here, sibling refers to the relative position of the
words in the hypernymy tree. Two words are sib-
lings of each other if they share a parent.
We compute a hypernym evidence score S(h, w)
for each candidate hypernym h for word w. It is the
sum of the normalized evidence for the hypernymy
relation between h and w, and the evidence for sib-
ling relations between w and known hyponyms s of
h:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9059675">
S(h, w) =
fhw + Ex fxw s Ey gyw
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999805083333333">
where fhw is the frequency of patterns that predict
that h is a hypernym of w, gsw is the frequency of
patterns that predict that s is a sibling of w, and x
and y are arbitrary words from the WordNet. For
each word w, we select the candidate hypernym h
with the largest score S(h, w).
For each hyponym, we only consider evidence
for hypernyms and siblings. We have experimented
with different scoring schemes, for example by in-
cluding evidence from hypernyms of hypernyms and
remote siblings, but found this basic scoring scheme
to perform best.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997274">
2.3 Evaluation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999969833333333">
We use the Dutch part of EuroWordNet (DWN)
(Vossen, 1998) for evaluation of our hypernym ex-
traction methods. Hypernym-hyponym pairs that are
present in the lexicon are assumed to be correct. In
order to have access to negative examples, we make
the same assumption as Snow et al. (2005): the hy-
pernymy relations in the WordNets are complete for
the terms that they contain. This means that if two
words are present in the lexicon without the target
relation being specified between them, then we as-
sume that this relation does not hold between them.
The presence of positive and negative examples al-
lows for an automatic evaluation in which precision,
recall and F values are computed.
We do not require our search method to find the
exact position of a target word in the hypernymy
tree. Instead, we are satisfied with any ancestor. In
order to rule out identification methods which sim-
ply return the top node of the hierarchy for all words,
we also measure the distance between the assigned
hypernym and the target word. The ideal distance is
one, which would occur if the suggested ancestor is
a parent. Grandparents are associated with distance
two and so on.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998767">
2.4 Composing web queries
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9938476">
In order to collect evidence for lexical relations, we
search the web for lexical patterns. When working
with a fixed corpus on disk, an exhaustive search can
be performed. For web search, however, this is not
possible. Instead, we rely on acquiring interesting
lexical patterns from text snippets returned for spe-
cific queries. The format of the queries has been
based on three considerations.
First, a general query like such as is insufficient
for obtaining much interesting information. Most
web search engines impose a limit on the number
of results returned from a query (for example 1000),
which limits the opportunities for assessing the per-
formance of such a general pattern. In order to ob-
tain useful information, the query needs to be more
specific. For the pattern such as, we have two op-
tions: adding the hypernym, which gives hypernym
such as, or adding the hyponym, which results in
such as hyponym.
Both extensions of the general pattern have their
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.9996085">
limitations. A pattern that includes the hypernym
may fail to generate enough useful information if the
hypernym has many hyponyms. And patterns with
hyponyms require more queries than patterns with
hypernyms (one per child rather than one per par-
ent). We chose to include hyponyms in the patterns.
This approach models the real world task in which
one is looking for the meaning of an unknown entity.
The final consideration regards which hyponyms
to use in the queries. Our focus is on evaluating the
approach via comparison with an existing WordNet.
Rather than submitting queries for all 45,979 nouns
in the lexical resource to the web search engine, we
will use a random sample of nouns.

3 Hypernym extraction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999295">
We describe our web extraction work and compare
the results with our earlier work with extraction from
a text corpus and hypernym prediction from mor-
phological information.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.88687">
3.1 Earlier work
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99995128">
In earlier work (Tjong Kim Sang and Hofmann,
2007), we have applied different methods for ob-
taining hypernym candidates for words. First,
we extracted hypernyms from a large text corpus
(300Mwords) following the approach of Snow et
al. (2006). We collected 16728 different contexts
in which hypernym-hyponym pairs were found and
evaluated individual context patterns as well as a
combination which made use of Bayesian Logistic
Regression. We also examined a single pattern pre-
dicting only sibling relations: A en(and) B.
Additionally, we have applied a corpus-indepen-
dent morphological approach which takes advantage
of the fact that in Dutch, compound words often
have the head in the final position (like blackbird in
English). The head is a good hypernym candidate
for the compound and therefore long words which
end with a legal Dutch word often have this suffix as
hypernym (Sabou et al., 2005).
The results of the approaches can be found in Ta-
ble 1. The corpus approaches achieve reasonable
precision rates. The recall scores are low because
we attempt to retrieve a hypernym for all nouns in
the WordNet. Surprisingly enough the basic mor-
phological approach outperforms all corpus meth-

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997687">
3.2 Extraction from the web
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99986472">
For our web extraction work, we used the same in-
dividual extraction patterns as in the corpus work:
zoals (such as) and en (and), but not the com-
bined hypernym patterns because the expected per-
formance did not make up for the time complexity
involved. We added randomly selected candidate
hyponyms to the queries to improve the chance to
retrieve interesting information.
This approach worked well. As Table 2 shows, for
both patterns the recall score improved in compari-
son with the corpus experiments. Additionally, the
single web hypernym pattern zoals outperformed the
combination of corpus hypernym patterns with re-
spect to recall and distance. Again, the conjunctive
pattern outperformed the hypernym pattern. We as-
sume that the frequency of the two patterns plays an
important role (the frequency of pages with the con-
junctive pattern is five times the frequency of pages
with zoals).
Finally, we combined word-internal information
with the conjunctive pattern approach by adding the
morphological candidates to the web evidence be-
fore computing hypernym pair scores. This ap-
proach achieved the highest recall score at only
slight precision loss (Table 2).

4 Concluding remarks
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999882772727273">
The contributions of this paper are two-fold. First,
we show that the large quantity of available web data
allows basic patterns to perform better on hyper-
nym extraction than a combination of extraction pat-
terns applied to a large corpus. Second, we demon-
strate that the performance of web extraction can be
improved by combining its results with those of a
corpus-independent morphological approach.
The described approach is already being applied
in a project for extending the coverage of the Dutch
WordNet. However, we remain interested in obtain-
ing a better performance levels especially in higher
recall scores. There are some suggestions on how
we could achieve this. First, our present selection
method, which ignores all but the first hypernym
suggestion, is quite strict. We expect that the lower-
ranked hypernyms include a reasonable number of
correct candidates as well. Second, a combination
of web patterns most likely outperforms individual
patterns. Obtaining results for many different web
pattens will be a challenge given the restrictions on
the number of web queries we can currently use.

For each hyponym, we only consider evidence for hypernyms and siblings. We have experimented with different scoring schemes, for example by including evidence from hypernyms of hypernyms and remote siblings, but found this basic scoring scheme to perform best. 2.3 Evaluation We use the Dutch part of EuroWordNet (DWN) (Vossen, 1998) for evaluation of our hypernym extraction methods. Hypernym-hyponym pairs that are present in the lexicon are assumed to be correct. In order to have access to negative examples, we make the same assumption as Snow et al. (2005): the hypernymy relations in the WordNets are complete for the terms that they contain. This means that if two words are present in the lexicon without the target relation being specified between them, then we assume that this relation does not hold between them. The presence of positive and negative examples allows for an automatic evaluation in which precision, recall and F values are computed. We do not require our search method to find the exact position of a target word in the hypernymy tree. Instead, we are satisfied with any ancestor.

Hearst (1992) was the first to apply fixed syntactic patterns like such NP as NP for extracting hypernym-hyponym pairs. Carballo (1999) built noun hierarchies from evidence collected from conjunctions. Pantel, Ravichandran and Hovy (2004) learned syntactic patterns for identifying hypernym relations and combined these with clusters built from co-occurrence information. Recently, Snow, Jurafsky and Ng (2005) generated tens of thousands of hypernym patterns and combined these with noun clusters to generate high-precision suggestions for unknown noun insertion into WordNet (Snow et al., 2006). The previously mentioned papers deal with English. Little work has been done for other languages. IJzereef (2004) used fixed patterns to extract Dutch hypernyms from text and encyclopedias. Van der Plas and Bouma (2005) employed noun distribution characteristics for extending the Dutch part of EuroWordNet. In earlier work, different techniques have been applied to large and very large text corpora. Today, the web contains more data than the largest available text corpus. For this reason, we are interested in employing the web for the extraction of hypernym relations. We are especially curiou</context>

More importantly, the resource contains hypernym information for 45,979 different nouns. A test with a Dutch newspaper text revealed that the WordNet only covered about two-thirds of the noun lemmas in the newspaper (among the missing words were e-mail, euro and provider). Proper names pose an even larger problem: the Dutch WordNet only contains 1608 words that start with a capital character. 2.2 Collecting evidence In order to find evidence for the existence of hypernym relations between words, we search the web for fixed patterns like H such as A, B and C. Following Snow et al. (2006), we derive two types of evidence from these patterns: • H is a hypernym of A, B and C • A, B and C are siblings of each other Here, sibling refers to the relative position of the words in the hypernymy tree. Two words are siblings of each other if they share a parent. We compute a hypernym evidence score S(h, w) for each candidate hypernym h for word w. It is the sum of the normalized evidence for the hypernymy relation between h and w, and the evidence for sibling relations between w and known hyponyms s of h: S(h, w) = fhw + Ex fxw s Ey gyw where fhw is the frequency of patterns that predic</context>

Rather than submitting queries for all 45,979 nouns in the lexical resource to the web search engine, we will use a random sample of nouns. 3 Hypernym extraction We describe our web extraction work and compare the results with our earlier work with extraction from a text corpus and hypernym prediction from morphological information. 3.1 Earlier work In earlier work (Tjong Kim Sang and Hofmann, 2007), we have applied different methods for obtaining hypernym candidates for words. First, we extracted hypernyms from a large text corpus (300Mwords) following the approach of Snow et al. (2006). We collected 16728 different contexts in which hypernym-hyponym pairs were found and evaluated individual context patterns as well as a combination which made use of Bayesian Logistic Regression. We also examined a single pattern predicting only sibling relations: A en(and) B. Additionally, we have applied a corpus-independent morphological approach which takes advantage of the fact that in Dutch, compound words often have the head in the final position (like blackbird in English). The head is a good hypernym candidate for the compound and therefore long words which end with a legal Dutch wo</context>
