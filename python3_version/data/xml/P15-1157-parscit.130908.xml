<bodyText confidence="0.999950842105263">
Framing is a sophisticated form of dis-
course in which the speaker tries to in-
duce a cognitive bias through consis-
tent linkage between a topic and a spe-
cific context (frame). We build on po-
litical science and communication theory
and use probabilistic topic models com-
bined with time series regression analy-
sis (autoregressive distributed-lag models)
to gain insights about the language dy-
namics in the political processes. Pro-
cessing four years of public statements is-
sued by members of the U.S. Congress,
our results provide a glimpse into the com-
plex dynamic processes of framing, atten-
tion shifts and agenda setting, commonly
known as ‘spin’. We further provide new
evidence for the divergence in party disci-
pline in U.S. politics.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999942230769231">
Language is one of the main tools used by politi-
cians to promote their agenda, gain popularity, win
elections and drive societal change (Luntz, 2007).
The growing availability of online archives of po-
litical data such as public statements, bill pro-
posals, floor speeches, interviews or social me-
dia streams allows computational analysis of many
aspects of the political process. The analysis
performed can increase transparency, facilitate a
better educated constituency and improve under-
standing of the political process.
In this paper we propose a framework for au-
tomatic analysis of a large collection of political
texts. Specifically, we demonstrate how the use
of Bayesian methods and time series analysis cap-
tures the different ways in which political parties
control the political discourse. We show that topic
ownership and framing strategies can be inferred
using topic models. Moreover, we demonstrate
how the models learned are used to construct time
series of expressed agendas. These time series are
fitted using autoregressive distributive-lag models
in order to learn the partisan temporal relations be-
tween topics and expressed agendas.
This framework could also be applied in other
domains such as ideology divergence in online
forums of radical groups or for measuring the
changes in public sentiment toward commercial
brands.
Contribution (i) To the best of our knowledge
this is the first work to analyze framing strategies
on large scale in an unsupervised manner1. (ii)
we combine topic models with regression analy-
sis in recovering longitudinal trends. (iii) We fur-
ther provide evidence for the dynamics of framing
campaigns, commonly known as ‘political spin2’.
Finally, (iv) we show how this framework can shed
new light on the broad scholarship on the diver-
gence of party discipline.

Some of the theoretical constructs employed by
Political Science scholars to describe features of
the political communication mechanism include:
topic ownership, framing, and agenda setting. Un-
derstanding these theoretical concepts is necessary
in laying the ground for our computational ap-
proach. This subsection provides the key defini-
tions and a brief survey of the relevant literature.
Topic/Issue Ownership We say that a candi-
date, a representative or a party owns a topic if this
topic, set of ideas or the competence in handling
specific issues are strongly associated with her/the

party (Petrocik, 1991; Petrocik, 1996; Damore,
2004). For example, environmental issues are tra-
ditionally associated with specific parties and not
others (e.g. in U.S. politics, environmental issues
are mostly associated with the Democratic party
(Dunlap et al., 2001)).
Framing Framing is the psychological schema
we use in order to organize and process our ex-
periences. Politicians can use different contextual
frames when referring to a specific topic, giving
the public very different views on the topic at hand
(Goffman, 1974; Gamson, 1989; Entman, 1993;
Chong and Druckman, 2007). A notable example
is the divisive partisan rhetoric used by U.S. politi-
cians when referring to the legality of abortion.
Democratic and Republican positions, framed as
’pro choice’ and ’pro life’, respectively, spin the
abortion discourse as an issue of values of individ-
ual freedom (pro-choice) or validating the sanctity
of life (pro-life). Similarly, Republicans refer to
the inheritance tax by the overwhelmingly nega-
tive coinage ‘death tax’, while Democrats use ‘es-
tate tax’.
Framing strategies, however, go beyond the use
of fixed phrases such as ‘death tax’ and ‘pro-
choice’. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) and
the debate over raising the minimum wage can be
framed as an issue of social justice or in the con-
text of the economic burden it incurs on tax payers
and by potential job loss.
Agenda Setting and shifting Agenda setting is
achieved by framing and by increased or decreased
attention (attention shifts) in order to set or change
the political, media or public agenda (McCombs
and Shaw, 1972; Scheufele and Tewksbury, 2007).
Some examples of agenda setting campaigns are
the repeated comments about the importance of
child vaccination, highlighting the need for equal
pay in the 2015 State of the Union Presidential Ad-
dress, or, more broadly, repeatedly addressing the
need for affordable healthcare.

2.2 Computational Analysis of Political Data
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999851355932203">
The availability of archives and streams of polit-
ical data is driving a growing number of compu-
tational works that address a wide array of Polit-
ical Science questions. Methods vary from sim-
ple word matching to more sophisticated Bayesian
models and deep learning techniques.
Slant in news articles has been modeled by
(Gentzkow and Shapiro, 2010) and (Lee, 2013),
comparing word tokens and n-grams to prede-
fined lists extracted from labeled data. Hidden
Markov Models are used by (Sim et al., 2013) in
order to measure ideological proportions in polit-
ical speech, and (Iyyer et al., 2014) use recursive
neural networks for a similar task.
Topic models have been used to detect connec-
tions between contributions and political agendas
as expressed in microblogging platforms (Yano et
al., 2013) and for reconstructing voting patterns
based on the language in congressional bills (Ger-
rish and Blei, 2012). The flow of policy ideas has
been modeled via measuring text reuse in different
versions of bill proposals (Wilkerson et al., 2013).
Nguyen et al. (2013) use supervised hierarchi-
cal topic regression to improve prediction of polit-
ical affiliation and sentiment.
Expressed agendas in press releases issued by
U.S. Senators have been modeled by Grimmer us-
ing author topic models (Grimmer, 2010). It is
important to point to some key differences be-
tween our work and Grimmer’s work. While the
model used by Grimmer allows attribution of a
single topic per document, we are interested in a
mixed membership model as we hypothesize pos-
sible correspondence between topics and frames.
Moreover, while we are interested in partisan dy-
namics, Grimmer is interested in the expressed
agendas of individuals thus focusing on an au-
thorship model. Finally, unlike Grimmer, we also
introduce autoregressive distributed-lag models in
order to capture temporal dynamics between top-
ics and parties as reflected in the data.
Another line of work can be found in the more
traditional Political Science scholarship. The suc-
cess of framing strategies is studied by the analysis
of real time reactions to political debates (Boyd-
stun et al., 2014). Autoregressive models are used
for analyzing adjustment of issue positions with
respect to news items during the Dutch national
election campaign of 2006 (Kleinnijenhuis and de
Nooy, 2013). This approach is based on manual
annotation of data.
Logistic regression on manually coded cam-
paign advertisements is used in order to learn the
dynamics of issue ownership by individual candi-
dates (Damore, 2004).
While some of the works above address related
research questions (agenda setting, topic own-
ership) or use similar computational approaches
(topic models, regression models), our work is the

A brief overview of the U.S. Congress The
American political system is a bicameral legisla-
ture composed of the Senate (100 senators, two
from each state) and the House of Representatives
(435 voting members plus 6 non-voting represen-
tatives, number depends on the population of each
state). Election is held every two years, in which
one third of the Senators and all members of the
House face reelection. Members are typically af-
filiated with either the Democratic Party or the Re-
publican Party. Congressional election and Presi-
dential election coincide every four years.
The Corpus We use a corpus of public state-
ments released by members of Congress in both
the Senate and The House of Representatives, col-
lected by Project Vote Smart3. An example of a
public statement is presented in Figure 1.
In this work we use all individual statements
and press releases in a span of four years (2010-
2013), a total of 134000 statements made by
641 representatives. This time span encompasses
two Congressional elections (November 2010 and
2012). Table 1 gives the number of Demo-
cratic and Republican representatives in the three
Congress terms (111-113) covered in our data.

4 Computational Framework
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999957666666667">
In order to automatically discover the correlated
dynamics of attention shifts, we take a layered ap-
proach, consisting of the stages described below.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.993825">
4.1 Topic Inference
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999982518518518">
In the first stage, we use topic models in order
to learn topic distribution over words and identify
the set of topics addressed in the corpus. Topic
Modeling describes a general algorithmic frame-
work for unsupervised discovery of a set of top-
ics expressed in a collection of documents. The
framework is based on the assumption that doc-
uments are generated by mixtures of k topics. It
is therefore assumed that documents are gener-
ated by the following process: for each word in
a document, we choose a topic from a given topic
distribution, then choose a word from the distri-
bution over words that the chosen topic specifies.
Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), the framework
employed here, assumes that the distribution over
topics has a Dirichlet prior. In practice, we as-
sume a Dirichlet prior on topics and use varia-
tional Bayes (VB) optimization to infer topic dis-
tributions over words (Blei et al., 2003). In order
to considerably improve efficiency, we use an on-
line variational Bayes inference algorithm, shown
to perform similarly to batch LDA (Hoffman et
al., 2010). It is important to note that our goals
and assumptions about the data do not lend them-
selvse to the use of dynamic or correlated topic
models (Blei and Lafferty, 2006a; Blei and Laf-
ferty, 2006b)4.

4.2 Topic Assignment and Unification

<bodyText confidence="0.999987222222222">
The distribution of ranked topics over documents
presents a “long tailed” distribution in which a few
topics achieve a significant coverage of a docu-
ment. This is a result of the mixed membership
“generative” approach and the bag-of-words as-
sumption. In a more realistic setting the number of
topics per document is restricted. We wish to re-
strict the number of topics per document while still
conforming to the mixture model assumption. We

4.3 Data Slicing
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999978888888889">
We slice the data according to four parameters:
topic (or topical cluster), time, party and document
(statement). These slicing parameters allow us the
flexibility required to thoroughly analyze the data.
In the time parameter, we have four settings: no
slicing (all data is treated as if it were produced
simultaneously), monthly slicing, weekly slicing
and daily slicing, each gives different granularity
of ownership patterns.

4.4 Autoregressive-Distributed-Lag Models
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999939678571429">
A linear function b + wT X = b + Ej wTj Xj is
a simple yet robust method for testing dependency
between X and Y . Ordinary least square regres-
sion finds the coefficients that minimize the mean
square error of Y = b + Ej wjT Xj given (X, Y ).
In our case (X, Y ) are time series. We argue that
a lagged dependency between two time series sug-
gests a framing or attention shifting campaign.
Regression analysis of time series assumes in-
dependence between error terms. This key statis-
tical property is often violated in real world data
as yt often depends on yt−1 thus the time series
residuals tend to correlate. The consequences of
violating the independence of errors are threefold:
i) Statistical tests of significance are uninforma-
tive and cannot be used to prove dependency be-
tween the model parameters, ii) The coefficients
learned lose accuracy, and iii) error terms are cor-
related, and hence contain information that is lost
in analysis instead of used to leverage the predic-
tion power of the model. The importance of con-
trolling for autoregressive properties and for sea-
sonality effects was recently demonstrated in the
error analysis of the Google Flu Trends algorithm
(Lazer et al., 2014).
In order to control for error dependency we add
the auto regressing component γTYn to the ordi-
nary regression, as shown in Equation 1:

matrix with the dimension of the seasonal granu-

the week and Iweek = I52x52 for the week of the
year. Ili,i = 1 iff t timestamp falls in the i-th day-
of-week/week-in-year.
Finally, in practice it is usually sufficient re-
strict the autoregressive term to one parameter
with j = 1 (accounting to the y value at the pre-
vious time stamp), this is consistent with the 24
hours news cycle reported by (Leskovec et al.,

correlated attention shifts we can substitute the

5.1 Topical Ownership and Framing

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999775407407407">
As an input for the topic modeling module (stage 1
of the system) we use a lexicon of the 10000 most
frequent words in the corpus. We use k = 100
as the number of topics. Experiments with k ∈
{30,50,500, 1000} produced topics that were ei-
ther too general or too incoherent. Once the topic-
word distributions were inferred, topics were val-
idated by two annotators examining the top 50
words for each topic. Annotators used hierarchi-
cal labels – an energy related topic ti could be an-
notated energy / clean-tech, while another topic tj
could be annotated energy / economy / keystone-
xl. Annotations were consolidated to unify the
coding5. After consolidation annotators agreed on
all topic annotations. Some examples of topics
labels are ‘health’, ‘energy’, ‘economy’, ‘boiler-
plate’, ‘political process’, ‘local’ and a few ‘ran-
dom’ topics.
After topic assignment as described in Section
4.2 each document is associated with only 2–6 top-
ics. In this work we focus on the 14 most salient
(concise, general and frequent) topics in the cor-
pus. These 14 topics fall under four topical clus-
ters - Health, Energy, Army/Security and Econ-
omy/Budget. Table 2 contains examples of top
words and labels for some of the topics from four
topical clusters.

one annotator and energy, green by the other, the annotators

(31604 vs. 31706), the counts of the individual
topics in the cluster are polarized. Remember that
these topical classes were all inferred by the LDA
in an unsupervised way. These partisan ownership
patterns were also confirmed by domain experts.
Longevity is a crucial factor in topic ownership.
A weekly ownership of a topic is achieved by a
party Q if it issued more statements on the topic
than party R in that particular week. We compute
the significance of the ownership assuming a null
hypothesis that statements are issued by the parties

by two Bernoulli processes with the same param-
eters. Table 4 provides the number of weeks each
party owned each topic and the number of weeks
it had a significant ownership (p &lt; 0.05)6.
Topic 30 illustrates the different perspectives.
The total statement count (see Table 3) reveals
a clear ownership by the Republican party, is-
suing 73% of the statements. While turning to
weekly ownership (Table 4) we get similar num-
ber (Republicans control 77% of the weeks); as-
suming only significance ownership, Republicans
significantly own the discourse for 79 weeks while
Democrats have significant ownership in only 2
weeks which means the Republicans own 97% of
the significantly owned weeks.

Topic cooccurrence could approximate the way
topics are framed. A heatmap of within state-
ment topic cooccurrence based on Pointwise Mu-
tual Information (PMI) (Church and Hanks, 1990)
is presented in Figure 4. The topical clusters are
characterized by blocks along the diagonal. The
blocks structure is to be expected due to the inher-
ent topical similarity within clusters. It is inter-
esting to see the inter-cluster differences in PMI
between the two parties. At the cluster level, Re-
publicans tend to use the Budget &amp; Economy top-
ics with topics in all other topical clusters, evident
by the stronger colors in the five bottom (left) rows
(columns) in 4b comparing to 4c.
A notable example is the way Republicans
frame the controversial Keystone XL project (En-
ergy, topic 38) with the impact on the job market
and small businesses (Budget &amp; Economy, topic
88), a topic traditionally owned by Democrats (see
top topical words in Table 2 and topic ownership
at Table 4).

5.2 Partisan Discipline

<bodyText confidence="0.99987075">
Party discipline is of great interest for political sci-
entists (Crook and Hibbing, 1985; Bowler et al.,
1999; Krehbiel, 2000; McCarty, 2001) . Typically,
party discipline is examined by analysis of roll call
votes on bills. Discipline, however can be also
measured by adherence to party lines in talking
points and agenda setting campaigns. Discipline,
therefore, can be captured by conformity of lan-

guage in public statements. While it is “common
knowledge” among political scientists that Repub-
licans are more adherent to “talking points” – to
the best of our knowledge there are no large scale
studies that support (or refute) that.
In the absence of official lists of “talking
points”, repeated use of similar phrases (n-grams)
can provide an indication for the level of party dis-
cipline. In each topic, we looked at all n-grams
(n ∈ {2, ...,14}) that were used by more than five
members of the Congress. For example, the tri-
gram “the American people” (topic 38) appears in
81 statements made by 54 members of congress,
only two of them were Democrats. Similarly, the
tri-gram “social security benefits” (topic 51) ap-
pears in 123 statements, issued by 89 members,
71 of which were Democrats. Examining “own-
ership” of n-grams (per n-gram, per topic) reveals
that that Republicans do tend to stick to talking
points more than Democrats do.
Figure 5 provides the average number of n-
grams owned by each party over all topics (top),
over Republican owned topics (middle) and over
Democratic owned topics (bottom). While on av-
erage Democrats own more n-grams than Repub-
licans (Figure 5, top), the difference is marginal
and is attributed to the fact that Democrats own
more topics than the Republicans (10 vs. 4, see Ta-
ble 3). Comparison between n-gram ownership in
Democratic owned topics and Republican owned
topics (Figure 5, middle and bottom) shows that
while each party owns more n-grams in the top-
ics it owns, Republicans present stronger owner-
ship over the n-grams in their owned topics than
Democrats in their respective owned topics. More-
over, Republicans present relative discipline even

in Democratic owned topics.
Manually looking at some sampled n-grams it
appears that mid-length n-grams are shared “talk-
ing points” and longer n-grams are full citations
from bill proposals and committee reports. These
findings are in line with textual sharing semantics
(Lin et al., 2015).

5.3 Time Series Analysis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999891261904762">
To this end we create two time series for each
topic c ∈ T: SCD c– daily normalized counts for
Democrats and SCR c– daily normalized counts for
Republicans. Normalization of counts is needed in
order to account for the bias introduced by the dif-
ference in the number of seats each party holds and
the changes in that number in the different terms
as apparent from Table 1.
Our data exhibit two strong seasonality effects:
a weekly cycle with the lowest point on the week-
end and peaking on Thursday (Figure 3a), and a
yearly cycle with low points at the weeks of 4th of
July, Thanksgiving, August recess and Christmas
(Figure 3b). These seasonality effects are captured
by the added terms in Equation 4.
After time series are constructed we apply first-
difference detrending (Enders, 2008) in order to
transform the time series to stationary series and
avoid trend-incurred correlations.
We fit autoregressive-distributed-lag models for
all pairs in {X = Sc,l, Y = Sc,}, where c, c&apos; ∈ T
(topics), l ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3,..., 7,14, ..., 28}.
In this setting we fit 5153 pairs of time series
of which 718 pairs had a significant coefficient for
X (p &lt; 0.05). Artificial significance due to abun-
dance of fitted models was accounted to by apply-
ing the strict Bonferroni correction (Dunn, 1961)
on the significance level. The correction resulted
in 103 significant correlations, most of them with
lag of up to 3 days. Table 5 gives the number of in-
tra/inter significant correlation for lags l ∈ 0, 1, 2.
One example for such correlation is the Repub-
licans “responding” to Democratic topic 88 with
with topic 8 (intra-cluster) in one and two days lag.
We interpret this as a different spin on the budget
issue. Another example is the Democratic party
corresponds to Republican topic 30 with topic 88
(inter-cluster) on the same day (no lag). We in-
terpret this as a way to place the Acordable Care
Act in a specific economic frame. We note that
while the lagged correlated time series do not im-
ply a responsive pattern, a significance of lagged

5.4 Discussion and Qualitative Analysis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999984933333333">
Inter and intra-cluster correlations can be inter-
preted as manifestations of different types of fram-
ing strategies and campaigns for attention shifts. A
detailed analysis of the interplay between the dif-
ferent frames is beyond the scope of this paper and
is left for political scientists.
The majority of the significant correlations were
found with no lag. It is important to note that these
correlations are found significant even after ac-
counting to autoregressive patterns. Zero-lag cor-
relations could be interpreted in a number of ways.
Two probable interpretations are (i) daily time se-
ries are too crude to model lag patterns, and (ii)
the parties respond to some external event at the
same time. While we cannot address (i) due to
sparseness and noise7, we can sample statements
and examine them manually. Manual examina-
tion reveals a strong responsive pattern in peak-
ing trends. One typical example is the Republican
spike in topic 30 on March 10. The statement at
Figure 1 is very illustrative as it explicitly refers
to a statement by President Obama. Explicit ref-
erences to statements made by the other side are
found more frequently in Republican statements
and reveal a clear responsive pattern that also sug-
gest a strong party discipline, in line with the re-
sults in Section 5.2. This small scale qualitative
analysis complements the quantitative results re-
ported in Section 5.3 and provide evidence for a
responsive pattern even in zero lag series.

<abstract confidence="0.98791225">Framing is a sophisticated form of discourse in which the speaker tries to induce a cognitive bias through consistent linkage between a topic and a specific context (frame). We build on political science and communication theory and use probabilistic topic models combined with time series regression analysis (autoregressive distributed-lag models) to gain insights about the language dynamics in the political processes. Processing four years of public statements issued by members of the U.S. Congress, our results provide a glimpse into the complex dynamic processes of framing, attention shifts and agenda setting, commonly known as ‘spin’. We further provide new evidence for the divergence in party discipline in U.S. politics.</abstract>

Finally, unlike Grimmer, we also introduce autoregressive distributed-lag models in order to capture temporal dynamics between topics and parties as reflected in the data. Another line of work can be found in the more traditional Political Science scholarship. The success of framing strategies is studied by the analysis of real time reactions to political debates (Boydstun et al., 2014). Autoregressive models are used for analyzing adjustment of issue positions with respect to news items during the Dutch national election campaign of 2006 (Kleinnijenhuis and de Nooy, 2013). This approach is based on manual annotation of data. Logistic regression on manually coded campaign advertisements is used in order to learn the dynamics of issue ownership by individual candidates (Damore, 2004).

Framing Framing is the psychological schema we use in order to organize and process our experiences.

A notable example is the divisive partisan rhetoric used by U.S. politicians when referring to the legality of abortion.

While turning to weekly ownership (Table 4) we get similar number (Republicans control 77% of the weeks); assuming only significance ownership, Republicans significantly own the discourse for 79 weeks while Democrats have significant ownership in only 2 weeks which means the Republicans own 97% of the significantly owned weeks. 5.1.3 Topic Cooccurrence Topic cooccurrence could approximate the way topics are framed. A heatmap of within statement topic cooccurrence based on Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) (Church and Hanks, 1990) is presented in Figure 4. The topical clusters are characterized by blocks along the diagonal. The blocks structure is to be expected due to the inherent topical similarity within clusters. It is interesting to see the inter-cluster differences in PMI between the two parties. At the cluster level, Republicans tend to use the Budget &amp; Economy topics with topics in all other topical clusters, evident by the stronger colors in the five bottom (left) rows (columns) in 4b comparing to 4c.

Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), the framework employed here, assumes that the distribution over topics has a Dirichlet prior. In practice, we assume a Dirichlet prior on topics and use variational Bayes (VB) optimization to infer topic distributions over words (Blei et al., 2003). In order to considerably improve efficiency, we use an online variational Bayes inference algorithm, shown to perform similarly to batch LDA (Hoffman et al., 2010). It is important to note that our goals and assumptions about the data do not lend themselvse to the use of dynamic or correlated topic models (Blei and Lafferty, 2006a; Blei and Lafferty, 2006b)4. 4.2 Topic Assignment and Unification The distribution of ranked topics over documents presents a “long tailed” distribution in which a few topics achieve a significant coverage of a document.

The importance of controlling for autoregressive properties and for seasonality effects was recently demonstrated in the error analysis of the Google Flu Trends algorithm (Lazer et al., 2014).

Ili,i = 1 iff t timestamp falls in the i-th dayof-week/week-in-year. Finally, in practice it is usually sufficient restrict the autoregressive term to one parameter with j = 1 (accounting to the y value at the previous time stamp), this is consistent with the 24 hours news cycle reported by (Leskovec et al., 2009) among others. Since our goal is to find correlated attention shifts we can substitute the summation distributed-lag term by a single lagged term.

Moreover, Republicans present relative discipline even 1635 in Democratic owned topics. Manually looking at some sampled n-grams it appears that mid-length n-grams are shared “talking points” and longer n-grams are full citations from bill proposals and committee reports. These findings are in line with textual sharing semantics (Lin et al., 2015). 5.3 Time Series Analysis To this end we create two time series for each topic c ∈ T: SCD c– daily normalized counts for Democrats and SCR c– daily normalized counts for Republicans. Normalization of counts is needed in order to account for the bias introduced by the difference in the number of seats each party holds and the changes in that number in the different terms as apparent from Table 1.

Processing four years of public statements issued by members of the U.S. Congress, our results provide a glimpse into the complex dynamic processes of framing, attention shifts and agenda setting, commonly known as ‘spin’. We further provide new evidence for the divergence in party discipline in U.S. politics. 1 Introduction Language is one of the main tools used by politicians to promote their agenda, gain popularity, win elections and drive societal change (Luntz, 2007). The growing availability of online archives of political data such as public statements, bill proposals, floor speeches, interviews or social media streams allows computational analysis of many aspects of the political process. The analysis performed can increase transparency, facilitate a better educated constituency and improve understanding of the political process. In this paper we propose a framework for automatic analysis of a large collection of political texts. Specifically, we demonstrate how the use of Bayesian methods and time series analysis captures the different ways in which p</context>
