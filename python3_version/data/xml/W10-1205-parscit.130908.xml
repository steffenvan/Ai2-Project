<bodyText confidence="0.9997816">
Bloggers, professional reviewers, and con-
sumers continuously create opinion–rich web
reviews about products and services, with the
result that textual reviews are now abundant on
the web and often convey a useful overall rat-
ing (number of stars). However, an overall rat-
ing cannot express the multiple or conflicting
opinions that might be contained in the text,
or explicitly rate the different aspects of the
evaluated entity. This work addresses the task
of automatically predicting ratings, for given
aspects of a textual review, by assigning a nu-
merical score to each evaluated aspect in the
reviews. We handle this task as both a re-
gression and a classification modeling prob-
lem and explore several combinations of syn-
tactic and semantic features. Our results sug-
gest that classification techniques perform bet-
ter than ranking modeling when handling eval-
uative text.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994171702127659">
An abundance of service and products reviews are
today available on the Web. Bloggers, professional
reviewers, and consumers continuously contribute
to this rich content both by providing text reviews
and often by assigning useful overall ratings (num-
ber of stars) to their overall experience. However,
the overall rating that usually accompanies online
reviews cannot express the multiple or conflicting
opinions that might be contained in the text, or ex-
plicitly rate the different aspects of the evaluated
entity. For example, a restaurant might receive an
overall great evaluation, while the service might
36
be rated below average due to slow and discourte-
ous wait staff. Pinpointing opinions in documents,
and the entities being referenced, would provide a
finer–grained sentiment analysis and a solid foun-
dation to automatically summarize evaluative text,
but such a task becomes even more challenging
when applied to a generic domain and with unsu-
pervised methods. Some significant contributions
by Hu and Liu (2004), Popescu and Etzioni (2005),
and Carenini et al. (2006) illustrate different tech-
niques to find and measure opinion orientation in
text documents. Other work in sentiment analysis
(often referred as opinion mining) has explored sev-
eral facets of the problem, ranging from predicting
binary ratings (e.g., thumbs up/down) (Turney, 2002;
Pang et al., 2002; Dave et al., 2003; Yu and Hatzivas-
siloglou, 2003; Pang and Lee, 2004; Yi and Niblack,
2005; Carenini et al., 2006), to more detailed opin-
ion analysis methods predicting multi–scale ratings
(e.g., number of stars) (Pang and Lee, 2005; Sny-
der and Barzilay, 2007; Shimada and Endo, 2008;
Okanohara and Tsujii, 2005).
This paper focuses on multi–scale multi–aspect
rating prediction for textual reviews. As mentioned
before, textual reviews are abundant, but when try-
ing to make a buy decision on a specific product
or service, getting sufficient and reliable informa-
tion can be a daunting and time consuming task.
On one hand, a single overall rating does not pro-
vide enough information and could be unreliable, if
not supported over a large number of independent
reviews/ratings. From another standpoint, reading
through a large number of textual reviews in order
to infer the aspect ratings could be quite time con-

<bodyText confidence="0.999668153846154">
In this section we review machine learning ap-
proaches that can predict ordinal ratings from textual
data. The goal is ordinal regression, which differs
from traditional numeric regression because the tar-
gets belong to a discrete space, but also differs from
classification as one wants to minimize the rank loss
rather than the classification error. The rank loss is
the average difference between actual and predicted
ratings and is defined as
where rai and rpi are actual and predicted ratings
respectively for the instance i, and N is the number
of considered reviews. There are several possible
approaches to such a regression problem.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.935558545454545">
1. The most obvious approach is numeric regres-
sion. It is implemented with a neural network
trained using the back–propagation algorithm.
2. Ordinal regression can also be implemented
with multiple thresholds (r − 1 thresholds are
used to split r ranks). This is implemented
with a Perceptron based ranking model called
PRank (Crammer and Singer, 2001).
3. Since rating aspects with values 1, 2, 3, 4 and
5 is an ordinal regression problem it can also
be interpreted as a classification problem, with

one class per possible rank. In this interpreta-
tion, ordering information is not directly used
to help classification. Our implementation uses
binary one-vs-all Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt)
classifiers. We will see that this very simple
approach can be extended to handle aspect in-
terdependency, as presented in section 7.
In order to provide us with a broad range of rating
prediction strategies, we experimented with a nu-
merical regression technique viz. neural network, an
ordinal regression technique viz. PRank algorithm,
and a classification technique viz. MaxEnt classi-
fiers. Their implementations are straightforward and
the run–time highly efficient. After selecting a strat-
egy from the previous list, one could consider more
advanced algorithms described in Section 8.

<bodyText confidence="0.999974692307692">
To predict aspect ratings of restaurants from their
textual reviews we used the reviews mined from the
we8there.com website to train different regres-
sion and classification models as outlined in Sec-
tion 4. In each of our experiments, we randomly
partitioned the data into 90% for training and 10%
for testing. This ensures that the distributions in
training and test data are identical. All the results
quoted in this paper are averages of 10–fold cross–
validation over 6,823 review examples. We con-
ducted repeatedly the same experiment on 10 differ-
ent training/test partitions and computed the average
rank loss over all the test partitions.

We introduce the following notation that will be
helpful in further discussion. There are m aspects.
For our data m is 5. Each aspect can have an inte-
ger rating from 1 to k. Once again, for our data k
is 5. Each review text document t can have ratings
r, which is a vector of m integers ranging 1 to k
(bold faced letters indicate vectors). Using the train-
ing data (t1, r1)..(ti, ri)..(tn, rn) we train m rating
predictors Rj(ti), one for each aspect j. Given text
ti predictor Rj outputs the most likely rating l for
the aspect j. In these experiments, we treated aspect
rating predictors as independent of each other. For
each rated aspect, predictor models were trained in-
dependently and were used independently to predict
ratings for each aspect.

5.1 Feature Selection
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.975967888888889">
We experimented with different combinations of
features, including word unigrams, bigrams, word
chunks, and parts–of–speech (POS) chunks. The as-
sumption is that bag–of–unigrams capture the ba-
sic word statistic and that bigrams take into account
some limited word context. POS chunks and word
chunks discriminate the use of words in the con-
text (e.g., a simple form word sense disambigua-
tion) and, at the same time, aggregate co–occurring
words (e.g., collocations), such as saut´eed onions,
buffalo burger, etc.
Most of the web–based reviews do not usually
provide fine–grained aspect ratings of products or
services, however, they often give an overall rating
evaluation. We therefore also experimented with the
overall rating as an input feature to predict the more
specific aspect ratings. Results of our experiments
are shown in Table 3.

Unigram and bigram features refer to unigram
words and bigram words occurring more than 3
times in the training corpus. Word chunks are ob-
tained by only processing Noun (NP), Verb (VP) and
Adjective (ADJP) phrases in the review text. We re-
moved modals and auxiliary verbs form VPs, pro-
nouns from NPs and we broke the chunks containing
conjunctions. Table 4 shows an example of extracted
word and parts–of–speech chunks from review text.
As can be seen, word chunks largely keep the infor-
mation bearing chunks phrases and remove the rest.

of word chunks.
In spite of richness of word and parts-of-speech,
chunks models using word unigrams perform the
best. We can attribute this to the data sparseness,
never–the–less, this results is in line with the find-
ings in Pang et al. (2002). Last column of Table 3
clearly shows that use of overall rating as input fea-
ture significantly improves the performance. Clearly
this validates the intuition that aspect ratings are
highly co–related with overall ratings.
For the remaining experiments, we used only the
unigram words as features of the review text. Since
overall ratings given by reviewers may contain their
biases and since they may not always be available,
we did not use them as input features. Our hope
is that even though we train the predictors using re-
viewers provided aspect ratings, learned models will
be able to predict aspect ratings that depend only on
the review text and not on reviewer’s biases.

Table 5 shows the results of our evaluation. Each
row in this table reports average rank loss of four
different models for each aspect. The baseline rank
loss is computed by setting the predicted rank for all
test examples to 5, as it is the most frequently occur-
ring rank in the training data (see also Table 2). As
shown in Table 5, the average baseline rank loss is
greater than one. The third column shows the results
from the neural network–based numeric regression.
The fourth column corresponds to the Perceptron–

results appear in the last column. For these results,
we also detail the standard deviation over the 10

6 Analysis
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.978157034482759">
As can be seen in table Table 5, Atmosphere and
Value are the worst performers. This is caused by
the missing textual support for these aspects in the
training data. Using manual examination of small
number of examples, we found that only 62% of
user given ratings have supporting text for ratings
of these aspects in the reviews.
For example, in Figure 2 the first review clearly
expresses opinions about food, service and atmo-
sphere (under appall of cigarette smoke), but there is
no evidence about value which is ranked three, two
notches above the other aspects. Similarly, the sec-
ond review is all about food without any reference
to service rated two notches above the other aspects,
or atmosphere or value.
Because of this reason, we do not expect any pre-
dictive model to do much better than 62% accuracy.
Manual examination of a small number of examples
also showed that 55% of ratings predicted by Max-
Ent models are supported by the review text. This is
89% of 62% (a rough upper bound) and can be con-
sidered satisfactory given small data set and differ-
ences among reviewers rating preference. One way
to boost the predictive performance would be to first
determine if there is a textual support for an aspect
rating, and use only the supported aspect ratings for
training and evaluation of the models. This however,
will require labeled data that we tried to avoid in this
work.

when evaluated using rank loss. As can be noticed,
the performance difference over the second best ap-
proach (back–propagation) usually exceeds the stan-
dard deviation.
MaxEnt results are also comparable to those pre-
sented in Snyder and Barzilay (2007) using the
Good Grief algorithm. Snyder and Barzilay (2007)
also used data from the we8there.com website.
While we are using the same data source, note
the following differences: (i) Snyder and Barzilay
(2007) used only 4,488 reviews as opposed to the
6,823 reviews used in our work; (ii) our results are
averaged over a 10 fold cross validation. As shown
with the baseline results reported in Table 6, the im-
pact on performance that can be attributed to these
differences is small. The most significant number,
which should minimize the impact of data discrep-
ancy, is the improvement over baseline (labeled as
“gain over baseline” in Table 6). In that respect,
our MaxEnt classification–based approach outper-
forms Good Grief for every aspect. Note also that,
while we trained 5 independent predictors (one for
each aspect) using only word unigrams as features,
the Good Grief algorithm additionally modeled the
agreements among aspect ratings and used the pres-
ence/absence of opposing polarity words in reviews
as additional features.

ratings
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999585454545455">
Inspired by these observations, we also trained Max-
Ent classifiers to predict pair–wise absolute differ-
ences in aspect ratings. Since the difference in rat-
ings of any two aspects can only be 0,1,2,3 or 4,
there are 5 classes to predict. For each test exam-
ple, MaxEnt classifiers output the posterior proba-
bility to observe a class given an input example. In
our approach, we use these probabilities to compute
the best joint assignment of ratings to all aspects.
More specifically, in our modified algorithm we use
2 types of classifiers.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.977071333333333">
• Rating predictors - Given the text ti, our clas-
sifiers Rj(ti) output vectors pi consisting of
probabilities pi� for text ti having a rating l for
the aspect j.
• Difference predictors - These correspond to
classifiers Dj�k(ti) which output vectors pij,k.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.96065525">
Elements of these vectors are the probabilities
that the difference between ratings of aspects j
and k is 0,1,2,3 and 4, respectively. While j
ranges from 1 to m, k ranges from 1 to j − 1.
Thus, we trained a total of m(m − 1)/2 = 10
difference predictors.
To predict aspect ratings for a given review text
ti we use both rating predictors and difference pre-
dictors and generate output probabilities. We then
select the most likely values of ri for text ti that sat-
isfies the probabilistic constraints generated by the
predictors. More specifically:

tuples in our case. Like Snyder and Barzilay (2007),
we also experimented with additional features in-
dicating presence of positive and negative polarity
words in the review text. Besides unigrams in the
review text, we also used 3 features: the counts of
positive and negative polarity words and their dif-

<bodyText confidence="0.9999715">
Textual reviews for different products and services
are abundant. Still, when trying to make a buy deci-
sion, getting sufficient and reliable information can
be a daunting task. In this work, instead of a sin-
gle overall rating we focus on providing ratings for
multiple aspects of the product/service. Since most
textual reviews are rarely accompanied by multiple
aspect ratings, such ratings must be deduced from
predictive models. Several authors in the past have
studied this problem using both classification and re-
gression models. In this work we show that even
though the aspect rating problem seems like a re-
gression problem, maximum entropy classification
models perform the best. Results also show a strong
inter–dependence in the way users rate different as-
pects.

<abstract confidence="0.996918476190476">Bloggers, professional reviewers, and consumers continuously create opinion–rich web reviews about products and services, with the result that textual reviews are now abundant on the web and often convey a useful overall rating (number of stars). However, an overall rating cannot express the multiple or conflicting opinions that might be contained in the text, or explicitly rate the different aspects of the evaluated entity. This work addresses the task of automatically predicting ratings, for given aspects of a textual review, by assigning a numerical score to each evaluated aspect in the reviews. We handle this task as both a regression and a classification modeling problem and explore several combinations of syntactic and semantic features. Our results suggest that classification techniques perform better than ranking modeling when handling evaluative text.</abstract>

There are several possible approaches to such a regression problem. 1. The most obvious approach is numeric regression. It is implemented with a neural network trained using the back–propagation algorithm. 2. Ordinal regression can also be implemented with multiple thresholds (r − 1 thresholds are used to split r ranks). This is implemented with a Perceptron based ranking model called PRank (Crammer and Singer, 2001). 3. Since rating aspects with values 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 is an ordinal regression problem it can also be interpreted as a classification problem, with one class per possible rank. In this interpretation, ordering information is not directly used to help classification. Our implementation uses binary one-vs-all Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) classifiers. We will see that this very simple approach can be extended to handle aspect interdependency, as presented in section 7. In order to provide us with a broad range of rating prediction strategies, we experimented with a numerical regression technique viz</context>

We removed modals and auxiliary verbs form VPs, pronouns from NPs and we broke the chunks containing conjunctions. Table 4 shows an example of extracted word and parts–of–speech chunks from review text. As can be seen, word chunks largely keep the information bearing chunks phrases and remove the rest. Parts–of–speech chunks are simply parts–of–speech 39 of word chunks. In spite of richness of word and parts-of-speech, chunks models using word unigrams perform the best. We can attribute this to the data sparseness, never–the–less, this results is in line with the findings in Pang et al. (2002). Last column of Table 3 clearly shows that use of overall rating as input feature significantly improves the performance. Clearly this validates the intuition that aspect ratings are highly co–related with overall ratings. For the remaining experiments, we used only the unigram words as features of the review text. Since overall ratings given by reviewers may contain their biases and since they may not always be available, we did not use them as input features. Our hope is that even though we train the predictors using reviewers provided aspect ratings, learned models will be able to predict </context>

This however, will require labeled data that we tried to avoid in this work. Figure 2: Example of ratings with partial support in the text review To our surprise, MaxEnt classification, although it minimizes a classification error, performs best even 40 when evaluated using rank loss. As can be noticed, the performance difference over the second best approach (back–propagation) usually exceeds the standard deviation. MaxEnt results are also comparable to those presented in Snyder and Barzilay (2007) using the Good Grief algorithm. Snyder and Barzilay (2007) also used data from the we8there.com website. While we are using the same data source, note the following differences: (i) Snyder and Barzilay (2007) used only 4,488 reviews as opposed to the 6,823 reviews used in our work; (ii) our results are averaged over a 10 fold cross validation. As shown with the baseline results reported in Table 6, the impact on performance that can be attributed to these differences is small.

Since the difference in ratings of any two aspects can only be 0,1,2,3 or 4, there are 5 classes to predict. For each test example, MaxEnt classifiers output the posterior probability to observe a class given an input example. In our approach, we use these probabilities to compute the best joint assignment of ratings to all aspects.

Thus, we trained a total of m(m − 1)/2 = 10 difference predictors. To predict aspect ratings for a given review text ti we use both rating predictors and difference predictors and generate output probabilities. We then select the most likely values of ri for text ti that satisfies the probabilistic constraints generated by the predictors. More specifically: log(pij,k |rj�rk|) 91 is the set of all possible ratings assignments to all aspects. In our case it contains 55 (3,125) tuples. tuples in our case. Like Snyder and Barzilay (2007), we also experimented with additional features indicating presence of positive and negative polarity words in the review text. Besides unigrams in the review text, we also used 3 features: the counts of positive and negative polarity words and their differences. Polarity labels are obtained from a dictionary of about 700 words. This dictionary was created by first collecting words used as adjectives in a corpus of un–related review text. We then retained only those words in the dictionary that, in a context free manner generally conveyed positive or negative evaluation of any object, event or</context>

Some significant contributions by Hu and Liu (2004), Popescu and Etzioni (2005), and Carenini et al. (2006) illustrate different techniques to find and measure opinion orientation in text documents. Other work in sentiment analysis (often referred as opinion mining) has explored several facets of the problem, ranging from predicting binary ratings (e.g., thumbs up/down) (Turney, 2002; Pang et al., 2002; Dave et al., 2003; Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003; Pang and Lee, 2004; Yi and Niblack, 2005; Carenini et al., 2006), to more detailed opinion analysis methods predicting multi–scale ratings (e.g., number of stars) (Pang and Lee, 2005; Snyder and Barzilay, 2007; Shimada and Endo, 2008; Okanohara and Tsujii, 2005).
