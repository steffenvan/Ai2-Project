Let L range over all natural languages (NLs). For any L,
one can consider two collections of strings of symbols,
one consisting of all strings over the terminal vocabulary
of L, call it W*(L), the other consisting of that always
very proper subcollection of W*(L) consisting of all and
only those members of W*(L) that are well-formed, that
is, that correspond to sentences of L. Call the latter
collection WF(L).
During the early development of generative grammar,
a number of attempts were made to show, for various
choices of L, that WF(L) was not a context-free (CF)
string collection. These attempts all had, naturally, a
common logical structure. First, it was claimed that there
was some mathematical property P which, if possessed by
some collection of strings, C, rendered C non-CF.
Second, it was claimed that WF(C) had P, so the conclu-
sion followed. Two sorts of criticisms can be, and have
been, directed at such attempted demonstrations. One
attacks the mathematical foundations and argues, for
particular choices of P, that a collection manifesting P is
not necessarily not CF. The other type of criticism
admits that if a collection manifests a particular property
P, it is thereby not CF, but contends that the WF(L)s
claimed to manifest P in fact don&apos;t.
A survey of the various attempts, from roughly 1960
to 1982, to prove for various L that WF(L) is not CF is
provided in Pullum and Gazdar (1982). These authors
conclude, justifiably we believe, that for one or the other
of the reasons mentioned above, none of these attempts,
including those by the present authors, stand up. Despite
widespread belief to the contrary, as of 1982 there had
been no demonstration that there is some NL L for which
WF(L) is not CF.2
However, Langendoen and Postal (1984) have
obtained a result infinitely stronger than the claim that
for some L, WF(L) is not CF. This work shows that for
any L, WF(L) is a proper class, hence not a set, much less
a recursively enumerable set. There is thus no question
of WF(L) being CF. Moreover, WF(L) can then have no
constructive characterization (generative grammar),
although there is no reason to doubt that it can be given
a nonconstructive characterization. But the demon-
stration of Langendoen and Postal (1984) is based on
principles that determine WF(L) includes nonfinite strings
corresponding to nonfinite (transfinite) sentences. It is
the existence of such sentences that places complete NLs
beyond generative (constructive) characterization.
Nevertheless, as noted in Langendoen and Postal (1984:
103), this novel result still leaves entirely open the ques-
tion of whether that subpart of WF(L) consisting of all
and only the well-formed finite strings in W*(L) is CF.
Let F(inite)WF(L) be that subcollection of WF(L)
consisting of all and only the finite strings corresponding
to the finite sentences of L. What follows shows that
there are dialects of English, El and E2, such that:
1 We thank J. Higginbotham for helpful comments on an earlier version
of this paper.
2 Recently, Higginbotham (1984) presents another argument that
English is not CF. The formal part of the demonstration seems impec-
cable, but the factual premises are questionable; see Pullum (p. 182).

1. The Sluicing Construction
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996413">
The present demonstration that FWF(E), E ranging over
various forms of English, is not CF is based on the sluic-
ing construction, first discussed by Ross (1969) and more
recently by van Riemsdijk (1978) and Levin (1982).
Standard examples of this construction include:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9647725">
3a. He stole something but it&apos;s not known what.
b. Someone stole the jewels and I can tell you who.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.583015333333333">
c. The police found him in some bar but the paper
didn&apos;t say which one.
The sluicing construction has the following properties:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.8278282">
4a. It consists of n (n &gt; 2) clauses, often, but not
necessarily coordinate clauses joined by but
b. Each of the second to nth clauses counting from the
left contains a wh-phrase, WH, which corresponds
to a potential indefinite phrase found in the first
clause.
c. WH has an interpretation equivalent to an entire
wh-clause, WH+Z, and the &apos;missing parts&apos; are
understood as identical to the first clause minus the
potential indefinite phrase.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9970704375">
The reason for the strange usage &apos;potential indefinite
phrase&apos; in (4b) is the existence of sluicing cases like (5b)
and (6b) alongside (5a) and (6a):
5a. Martha was abducted by someone but we don&apos;t
know by who(m).
b. Martha was abducted but we don&apos;t know by
who(m).
6a. The doctors screamed for some reason but we don&apos;t
know why.
b. The doctors screamed but we don&apos;t know why.
Depending on frameworks, one might analyze cases like
(5b) and (6b) as involving invisible versions of indefinite
phrases like those in the corresponding (5a) and (6a).
But this matter need not concern us. We can concentrate
on cases where alternatives like (5b) and (6b) are not
possible, as in (7):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.568781333333333">
7a. Max visited someone but we don&apos;t know who.
b. *Max discussed Tom but we don&apos;t know who.
C. *Max discussed but we don&apos;t know who.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999386210526315">
That is, we pick cases where WH can only be anaphori-
cally connected to a visible element in the first clause.
From this point on, references to the sluicing
construction only denote cases of this restricted sort.
The nature of the formal argument to be presented is
such that this limitation in no way impugns the validity of
the present result, since one can still construct a model of
the intersection situation described at the end of the
previous section.
In (3a), WH is what, the indefinite phrase correspond-
ing to it is something and WH is understood as equivalent
to the wh-clause what he stole, since he stole is the whole
first clause minus the indefinite phrase. A similar analysis
holds for (3b).
In (3), as in most of the examples in the literature
previously illustrating the sluicing construction, the indef-
inite phrase in the first clause is an indefinite pronoun,
and WH is a wh-pronoun. However, both phrases can
consist of multi-word sequences:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9984214">
8a. Sarah considered some proposals but it&apos;s unknown
how many.
b. If any books are still left on the sale table, find out
which ones.
c. The warehouse will ship us several typewriters but
we have no idea how many machines.
d. A few physicians still use this drug and Sam can tell
you how many doctors.
e. Joe discussed certain formulas but which formulas
is uncertain.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99936274074074">
Let us from this point on, for simplicity, limit attention to
sluicing constructions consisting of only two clauses.
Then it is possible to represent all the relevant cases
schematically as follows:
9. v Q1 X1 W [Y Q2 X2 Z], where V, W, Y and Z are
strings; 01 is an indefinite quantifier or pronoun; X1
is the rest of the nominal quantified by Ql; Q2 is a
wh-quantifier or pronoun anaphorically related to
01; and X2 is the rest of the nominal quantified by
02. Moreover, 02 X2 (= WH) is understood as a
wh-clause that contains material from V or W.
Table 1 presents the values of Qi, X 1 , 02 and X2 in the
examples in (8a-e). Henceforth, we further restrict the
class of sluicing constructions under consideration, limit-
ing attention only to examples like (8c-e), in which X1
and X2 are neither empty nor pronouns.
In (8c-e), the main stress on the wh-phrase can fall on
either 02 or on X2. If it falls on X2, then the wh-phrase
can not be anaphorically related to the corresponding
indefinite phrase in the first clause. While we cannot,
and need not, give a theoretical account of
&amp;quot;anaphorically related&amp;quot;, informally it means that the
potential reference of the wh-phrase is determined by
that of its antecedent. Hence the lack of anaphoric
connection in cases of stressed X2 means that in partic-
ular, in (8c), machines does not denote the same things
that typewriters does in that sentence; in (8d), physicians

does not denote the same people that doctors does (the
latter perhaps referring to nonmedical doctors); and in
(8e) the two occurrences of formulas then denote differ-
ent things (say, mathematical formulas in the first
instance and baby milk formulas in the second). On the
other hand, if phrasal stress falls on Q2, then the
wh-phrase is anaphorically related to the corresponding
indefinite phrase in the first clause. In (8c), machines is
then taken to denote the same things that typewriters
does; in (8d), physicians is then taken to denote the same
people that doctors does and in (8e) the two occurrences
of formulas denote the same objects, whether mathemat-
ical or nutritional.
Henceforth, we limit attention only to examples in
which phrasal stress falls on Q2 (indicated by small caps).
These are therefore structures where the wh-phrase in the
second clause is anaphorically related to the correspond-
ing indefinite phrase in the first clause.
It turns out that variants of English differ with respect
to the class of wh-phrases that can be used
anaphorically.3 So, for many speakers, but not all, (8c-e)
are fully acceptable with phrasal stress on 02. For
others, only (8e) is fully acceptable; in fact, (8c,d) are
judged to be ungrammatical. For the latter dialect,
henceforth referred to as El, the subpart of the sluicing
construction on which we have focused is subject to the
constraint informally stated as in (10), henceforth
referred to as the strong matching condition (SMC).4
10. If WH is the anaphoric wh-phrase in the second
clause, then, if X2 is neither null nor a pronoun, the
sequence of linguistic elements up to and including
the head noun of X2 must be identical to the material
up to and including the head noun of Xl.
According to SMC, only the posthead modifiers of X1
and X2 can differ in El, as in:
11. Joe discussed several attempts to grow corn on Mars
but WHICH attempts is unknown.
If prehead modifiers differ, then the resulting structure is
ungrammatical in El:
12. El*Joe discussed lots of curious proposals but
everyone has forgotten WHICH proposals.
Now consider another dialect, call it E2, in which
(8c-e) are fully grammatical when phrasal stress falls on
02. For E2 speakers, the relation between X1 and X2 is
governed by condition (13), which we refer to as the
weak matching condition (WMC).
13. X2 is a possible anaphor of Xl.
According to WMC, X2 can either be a complete repe-
tition of X1, as in (8e); a synonym of Xl, as in (8d); or a
term whose denotation includes that of Xl, as in (8c),
(11) and (12), the last two examples being well-formed
in E2. However, if X2 is not a possible anaphor of X1
and phrasal stress falls on Q2, then the resulting structure
is ungrammatical even in E2. Since the following exam-
ples are ungrammatical in both El and E2, they are
marked with double asterisks.

<listItem confidence="0.771623666666667">
14a. **The warehouse will ship several machines to our
office but we have no idea how MANY typewriters.
b. **A few physicians still use this drug and Sam can
tell you how MANY nurses.
c. **Joe discussed certain formulas but WHICH
equations is uncertain.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999243153846154">
In (14a), typewriters cannot be used as an anaphor for
machines, presumably because the reference of the
former fails to subsume that of the latter. This judge-
ment is rendered by E2 speakers even for contexts in
which the words typewriters and machines are otherwise
used interchangeably, such as an office with limited word
processing equipment. This shows that one is dealing
here with a grammatical restriction, not a pragmatic
property that varies with context. Similarly, in (14b),
nurses cannot be used as an anaphor for physicians, since
some physicians are not nurses and some nurses are not
physicians; again this is true even in a context in which
all the nurses under discussion happen to be physicians
and vice versa. Finally, equations cannot be used as an
anaphor for formulas in (14c), since again an equation is
only a certain kind of formula (statements of inequality
are also formulas). One who judges that (14c) is in fact
grammatical might well do so under the mistaken belief
that all mathematical formulas are equations. Alterna-
tively, one could assume that such a judge has a different
dialect of English, with different anaphoric conditions.
Now consider examples of the sluicing construction in
which a compound noun occurs as Xl. If X2 exactly
matches Xl, then the result is grammatical in both El and
E2. If only the head of the compound occurs as X2, then
the results are always ungrammatical in El, and either

differences in anaphoric usages for these distinct forms of the language.

e. **Joe discussed some bourbon lover but it&apos;s not

<bodyText confidence="0.990731578947368">
The whole compound can be used as an anaphor for
itself in both El and E2, as in (15a). But store cannot be
used as an anaphor for candy store in (15b) in El, since
SMC is not satisfied. On the other hand, store can be
used as an anaphor for candy store in (15b) in E2,
presumably since a candy store is a certain kind of store;
that is, candy store is an endocentric compound. Howev-
er, escape cannot be used as an anaphor for fire escape,
even in E2, since a fire escape, which is a certain kind of
physical object, is not an escape, which is a certain kind
of event; that is, fire escape is an exocentric compound.
Finally, hater and lover cannot be used as anaphors for
bourbon hater or bourbon lover in (15d,e), since the agen-
tive noun hater is used only in compounds and lover; by
itself has a limited (sexual) meaning which makes it
unsuitable as an anaphor for compounds such as bourbon
lover
An important consequence for the present discussion
is that if one limits the vocabulary over which sluicing
constructions are formed in the right way, the conditions
of linkage in El and E2, though intensionally distinct,
become extensionally identical. That is, for fixed cases,
SMC and WMC have the same consequences. For any
such situation, one can thus equate them and refer simply
to the matching condition (MC).
It is possible to embed English compounds within
compounds; in particular, there are well-formed
compounds such as bourbon hater lover &apos;one who loves
bourbon haters&apos;, bourbon lover hater &apos;one who hates
bourbon lovers&apos;, bourbon hater lover hater &apos;one who hates
those who love bourbon haters&apos;, etc. Now, if any such
compound occurs as X1 in a sluicing construction, then
for speakers of both El and E2 the only possible anaphor
drawn exclusively from the vocabulary used to construct the
compound that can occur as X2 is the whole compound
itself.
16a. Joe discussed some bourbon hater lover but it&apos;s not
known WHICH bourbon hater lover.

<listItem confidence="0.99180725">

c. **Joe discussed some bourbon hater lover but it&apos;s

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999641571428571">
It follows that if attention is limited to instances of the
sluicing construction like (16), in which the only possible
anaphoric wh-expressions are whole compounds, then
SMC and WMC are equivalent, permitting one to speak
simply of MC with no loss of accuracy. Given this fact,
we are now in a position to demonstrate simultaneously
that neither FWF(E1) nor FWF(E2) is CF.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.955683" genericHeader="categories and subject descriptors">
2. The Proof
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99543934375">
We first define the following notion:
17. A copying language is any language of the form:
L cxdxe I x E (a,b)* and a,b,c,d,e are fixed strings}
Given that English contains a sluicing construction char-
acterized as in section 1, one can prove that FWF(E), E
ranging over El and E2, is not CF by means of the Inter-
section Theorem of (2) and the fact that copying
languages are not CF (Langendoen 1977). To prove that
FWF(E) is not CF, one must find a regular language R
whose intersection I with FWF(E) is not CF. Such an R is
given in (18):
18. R = {Joe discussed some bourbon x but WHICH
bourbon y is unknown I x,y E (hater, lover)*}
Since R is a concatenation of regular languages, it is itself
regular.
Now consider the intersection of R with FWF(E). The
matching condition on sluicing constructions guarantees
that this intersection is the copying language I in (19):
19. I = {Joe discussed some bourbon x but WHICH
bourbon x is unknown I x,y E (hater, lover)*}
Since I is not CP, by the Intersection Theorem, neither is
FWF(E).
As has been stressed, limitations on the vocabulary
render the distinct sluicing conditions of El and E2
equivalent over certain subcollections of sluicing cases.
It follows that the demonstration just presented holds not
only for El and E2 but more generally for any variant of
English whose matching condition for sluicing, even if
different from that of both El and E2 for the full
collection of English sentences, has the same extension
for the language R of (18). We see no current reason to
doubt that this will include every variant of English.

But as Langendoen and Postal (1984) shows, NLs are
proper classes not sets, so the question of WF(L)s as
wholes being CF no longer arises. Restricting attention
to FWF(L)s, the result of Section 2 shows that for any
dialect E of English for which MC holds, FWF(E) is not
CF.
Since, however, neither FWF(E) nor any other FWF(L)
has been shown to lie outside the domain of indexed
languages (ILs) in the sense of Aho (1968), it would
appear that one can conclude that while the collection of
all sentences in an NL K is a proper class, FWF(K) is an
IL. Consequently, a correct account of NL grammars
must be such that a proper grammar for K specifies K as
an appropriate proper class5 and entails that FWF(K) is
an IL. A grammatical theory with just these properties
remains to be constructed.
5By &apos;appropriate&apos;, we mean one which satisfies inter alia the axiom
called Closure Under Coordinate Compounding of Sentences in
Langendoen and Postal (1984: 53). This is necessary for the proof that
NLs are proper classes.

For any L, one can consider two collections of strings of symbols, one consisting of all strings over the terminal vocabulary of L, call it W*(L), the other consisting of that always very proper subcollection of W*(L) consisting of all and only those members of W*(L) that are well-formed, that is, that correspond to sentences of L. Call the latter collection WF(L). During the early development of generative grammar, a number of attempts were made to show, for various of L, that WF(L) was context-free (CF) string collection. These attempts all had, naturally, a common logical structure. First, it was claimed that there was some mathematical property P which, if possessed by some collection of strings, C, rendered C non-CF. Second, it was claimed that WF(C) had P, so the conclusion followed. Two sorts of criticisms can be, and have been, directed at such attempted demonstrations. One attacks the mathematical foundations and argues, for particular choices of P, that a collection manifesting P is not necessarily not CF. The other type of criticism admits that if a collection manifests a particular property P, it is thereby not CF, but contends that the WF(L)s claimed to manifest P in fact don&apos;t. A survey of the various attempts, from roughly 1960 to 1982, to prove for various L that WF(L) is not CF is provided in Pullum and Gazdar (1982). These authors conclude, justifiably we believe, that for one or the other of the reasons mentioned above, none of these attempts, including those by the present authors, stand up. Despite widespread belief to the contrary, as of 1982 there had been no demonstration that there is some NL L for which is not However, Langendoen and Postal (1984) have obtained a result infinitely stronger than the claim that for some L, WF(L) is not CF. This work shows that for L, WF(L) is a hence not a set, much less a recursively enumerable set. There is thus no question of WF(L) being CF. Moreover, WF(L) can then have no characterization grammar), although there is no reason to doubt that it can be given a nonconstructive characterization. But the demonstration of Langendoen and Postal (1984) is based on principles that determine WF(L) includes nonfinite strings corresponding to nonfinite (transfinite) sentences. It is the existence of such sentences that places complete NLs beyond generative (constructive) characterization. Nevertheless, as noted in Langendoen and Postal (1984: 103), this novel result still leaves entirely open the question of whether that subpart of WF(L) consisting of all only the well-formed in W*(L) is CF. that subcollection of WF(L) consisting of all and only the finite strings corresponding to the finite sentences of L. What follows shows that there are dialects of English, El and E2, such that: 1We thank J. Higginbotham for helpful comments on an earlier version of this paper. 2Recently, Higginbotham (1984) presents another argument that English is not CF. The formal part of the demonstration seems impeccable, but the factual premises are questionable; see Pullum (p. 182). Copyright 1 985 by the Association for Computational Linguistics.

The Intersection Theorem Let L be a stringset aria let R be a regular stringset. is not a CF stringset, then neither is One can then show that, for example, FWF(E1) and not CF by finding some regular set R such R fl FWF(E1) and fl not CF (Daly 1974). 1. The Sluicing Construction The present demonstration that FWF(E), E ranging over forms of English, is not CF is based on the sluicfirst discussed by Ross (1969) and more recently by van Riemsdijk (1978) and Levin (1982). Standard examples of this construction include: 3a. He stole something but it&apos;s not known what. b. Someone stole the jewels and I can tell you who. c. The police found him in some bar but the paper didn&apos;t say which one. The sluicing construction has the following properties: It consists of (n &gt; often, but not coordinate clauses joined by b. Each of the second to nth clauses counting from the left contains a wh-phrase, WH, which corresponds to a potential indefinite phrase found in the first clause. c. WH has an interpretation equivalent to an entire wh-clause, WH+Z, and the &apos;missing parts&apos; are understood as identical to the first clause minus the potential indefinite phrase. The reason for the strange usage &apos;potential indefinite phrase&apos; in (4b) is the existence of sluicing cases like (5b) and (6b) alongside (5a) and (6a): 5a. Martha was abducted by someone but we don&apos;t know by who(m). b. Martha was abducted but we don&apos;t know by who(m). 6a. The doctors screamed for some reason but we don&apos;t know why. b. The doctors screamed but we don&apos;t know why. Depending on frameworks, one might analyze cases like (5b) and (6b) as involving invisible versions of indefinite phrases like those in the corresponding (5a) and (6a). But this matter need not concern us. We can concentrate on cases where alternatives like (5b) and (6b) are not possible, as in (7): 7a. Max visited someone but we don&apos;t know who. b. *Max discussed Tom but we don&apos;t know who. C. *Max discussed but we don&apos;t know who. That is, we pick cases where WH can only be anaphoriconnected to a in the first clause. From this point on, references to the sluicing construction only denote cases of this restricted sort. The nature of the formal argument to be presented is such that this limitation in no way impugns the validity of the present result, since one can still construct a model of the intersection situation described at the end of the previous section. (3a), WH is indefinite phrase correspondto it is understood as equivalent the wh-clause he stole, stole the whole first clause minus the indefinite phrase. A similar analysis holds for (3b). In (3), as in most of the examples in the literature previously illustrating the sluicing construction, the indefinite phrase in the first clause is an indefinite pronoun, and WH is a wh-pronoun. However, both phrases can consist of multi-word sequences: 8a. Sarah considered some proposals but it&apos;s unknown how many. b. If any books are still left on the sale table, find out which ones. c. The warehouse will ship us several typewriters but we have no idea how many machines. d. A few physicians still use this drug and Sam can tell you how many doctors. e. Joe discussed certain formulas but which formulas is uncertain. Let us from this point on, for simplicity, limit attention to sluicing constructions consisting of only two clauses. Then it is possible to represent all the relevant cases schematically as follows: v X1 W [Y Q2 X2 where V, W, Z are strings; 01 is an indefinite quantifier or pronoun; X1 is the rest of the nominal quantified by Ql; Q2 is a wh-quantifier or pronoun anaphorically related to 01; and X2 is the rest of the nominal quantified by 02. Moreover, 02 X2 (= WH) is understood as a wh-clause that contains material from V or W. Table 1 presents the values of Qi, X 1 , 02 and X2 in the examples in (8a-e). Henceforth, we further restrict the class of sluicing constructions under consideration, limiting attention only to examples like (8c-e), in which X1 X2 neither empty nor pronouns. In (8c-e), the main stress on the wh-phrase can fall on either 02 or on X2. If it falls on X2, then the wh-phrase related the corresponding indefinite phrase in the first clause. While we cannot, and need not, give a theoretical account of &amp;quot;anaphorically related&amp;quot;, informally it means that the potential reference of the wh-phrase is determined by that of its antecedent. Hence the lack of anaphoric connection in cases of stressed X2 means that in particin (8c), not denote the same things in that sentence; in (8d), Linguistics, Volume 10, Numbers 3-4, July-December Paul M. Postal and D. Terence Langendoen English and the Class of Context-Free Languages EXAMPLE 01 X1 02 X2 some proposals how many any books which ones several typewriters how many machines a few physicians how many doctors certain formulas which formulas not denote the same people that (the latter perhaps referring to nonmedical doctors); and in the two occurrences of denote different things (say, mathematical formulas in the first instance and baby milk formulas in the second). On the other hand, if phrasal stress falls on Q2, then the wh-phrase is anaphorically related to the corresponding phrase in the first clause. In (8c), taken to denote the same things that in (8d), then taken to denote the same that and in (8e) the two occurrences the same objects, whether mathematical or nutritional. Henceforth, we limit attention only to examples in which phrasal stress falls on Q2 (indicated by small caps). These are therefore structures where the wh-phrase in the second clause is anaphorically related to the corresponding indefinite phrase in the first clause. It turns out that variants of English differ with respect to the class of wh-phrases that can be used So, for many speakers, but not all, (8c-e) are fully acceptable with phrasal stress on 02. For others, only (8e) is fully acceptable; in fact, (8c,d) are judged to be ungrammatical. For the latter dialect, referred to as subpart of the sluicing construction on which we have focused is subject to the constraint informally stated as in (10), henceforth to as the matching condition If WH the anaphoric wh-phrase in the second clause, then, if X2 is neither null nor a pronoun, the sequence of linguistic elements up to and including noun X2 must be identical to the material up to and including the head noun of Xl. According to SMC, only the posthead modifiers of X1 and X2 can differ in El, as in: 11. Joe discussed several attempts to grow corn on Mars is unknown. If prehead modifiers differ, then the resulting structure is ungrammatical in El: 12. El*Joe discussed lots of curious proposals but has forgotten Now consider another dialect, call it E2, in which (8c-e) are fully grammatical when phrasal stress falls on For E2 speakers, the relation between X1 and governed by condition (13), which we refer to as the weak matching condition (WMC). 13. X2 is a possible anaphor of Xl. According to WMC, X2 can either be a complete repetition of X1, as in (8e); a synonym of Xl, as in (8d); or a term whose denotation includes that of Xl, as in (8c), (11) and (12), the last two examples being well-formed E2. However, if not a possible anaphor of X1 and phrasal stress falls on Q2, then the resulting structure is ungrammatical even in E2. Since the following examare ungrammatical in and E2, they are marked with double asterisks. 14a. **The warehouse will ship several machines to our but we have no idea how b. **A few physicians still use this drug and Sam can you how **Joe discussed certain formulas but equations is uncertain. (14a), be used as an anaphor for because the reference of the former fails to subsume that of the latter. This judgement is rendered by E2 speakers even for contexts in the words otherwise used interchangeably, such as an office with limited word processing equipment. This shows that one is dealing here with a grammatical restriction, not a pragmatic property that varies with context. Similarly, in (14b), be used as an anaphor for some physicians are not nurses and some nurses are not physicians; again this is true even in a context in which all the nurses under discussion happen to be physicians vice versa. Finally, be used as an for (14c), since again an equation is only a certain kind of formula (statements of inequality are also formulas). One who judges that (14c) is in fact grammatical might well do so under the mistaken belief that all mathematical formulas are equations. Alternatively, one could assume that such a judge has a different dialect of English, with different anaphoric conditions. Now consider examples of the sluicing construction in a noun as Xl. If matches Xl, then the result is grammatical in both El and only the head of the compound occurs as results are always ungrammatical in either have not investigated whether this correlates with more general differences in anaphoric usages for these distinct forms of the language. Moreover, this is not relevant to the present demonstration. is the dialect of the first author. Computational Linguistics, Volume 10, Numbers 3-4, July-December 1984 179 Paul M. Postal and D. Terence Langendoen English and the Class of Context-Free Languages grammatical or ungrammatical in E2, depending on the relation between X1 and X2. As before, double asterisks mark examples that are ungrammatical in both El and E2. 15a. Joe discussed some candy store but it&apos;s not known WHICH candy store. b. El*Joe discussed some candy store but it&apos;s not known WHICH store. c. **Joe discussed some fire escape but it&apos;s not known WHICH escape. d. **Joe discussed some bourbon hater but it&apos;s not known WHICH hater. e. **Joe discussed some bourbon lover but it&apos;s not known WHICH lover. The whole compound can be used as an anaphor for in both El and E2, as in (15a). But be as an anaphor for store (15b) in El, since is not satisfied. On the other hand, be as an anaphor for store (15b) in presumably since a candy store is a certain kind of store; is, store an endocentric compound. Howevbe used as an anaphor for escape, even in E2, since a fire escape, which is a certain kind of physical object, is not an escape, which is a certain kind event; that is, escape an exocentric compound. be used as anaphors for hater lover (15d,e), since the agennoun used only in compounds and lover; by itself has a limited (sexual) meaning which makes it as an anaphor for compounds such as lover An important consequence for the present discussion is that if one limits the vocabulary over which sluicing constructions are formed in the right way, the conditions of linkage in El and E2, though intensionally distinct, become extensionally identical. That is, for fixed cases, SMC and WMC have the same consequences. For any such situation, one can thus equate them and refer simply the condition It is possible to embed English compounds within compounds; in particular, there are well-formed such as hater lover who loves haters&apos;, lover hater who hates lovers&apos;, hater lover hater who hates those who love bourbon haters&apos;, etc. Now, if any such compound occurs as X1 in a sluicing construction, then for speakers of both El and E2 the only possible anaphor drawn exclusively from the vocabulary used to construct the can occur as X2 is the whole compound itself. 16a. Joe discussed some bourbon hater lover but it&apos;s not known WHICH bourbon hater lover. b. **Joe discussed some bourbon hater lover but it&apos;s not known WHICH hater lover. c. **Joe discussed some bourbon hater lover but it&apos;s not known WHICH lover. It follows that if attention is limited to instances of the sluicing construction like (16), in which the only possible anaphoric wh-expressions are whole compounds, then SMC and WMC are equivalent, permitting one to speak simply of MC with no loss of accuracy. Given this fact, we are now in a position to demonstrate simultaneously that neither FWF(E1) nor FWF(E2) is CF. 2. The Proof define the following notion: A language any language of the form: cxdxe I x and a,b,c,d,e are fixed strings} Given that English contains a sluicing construction characterized as in section 1, one can prove that FWF(E), E ranging over El and E2, is not CF by means of the Intersection Theorem of (2) and the fact that copying languages are not CF (Langendoen 1977). To prove that not CF, one must find a regular language R whose intersection I with FWF(E) is not CF. Such an R is given in (18): 18. R = {Joe discussed some bourbon x but WHICH y is unknown I x,y lover)*} Since R is a concatenation of regular languages, it is itself regular. Now consider the intersection of R with FWF(E). The matching condition on sluicing constructions guarantees that this intersection is the copying language I in (19): 19. I = {Joe discussed some bourbon x but WHICH x is unknown I x,y lover)*} Since I is not CP, by the Intersection Theorem, neither is FWF(E). As has been stressed, limitations on the vocabulary render the distinct sluicing conditions of El and E2 equivalent over certain subcollections of sluicing cases. It follows that the demonstration just presented holds not only for El and E2 but more generally for any variant of English whose matching condition for sluicing, even if different from that of both El and E2 for the full collection of English sentences, has the same extension for the language R of (18). We see no current reason to that this will include of English. 3. Conclusion Gazdar (1983: 86), summarizing inter alia the conclusions of Pullum and Gazdar (1982), makes the following claims: 20a. &amp;quot;There is no reason, at the present time, to think that NLs are not CFLs.&amp;quot; b. &amp;quot;There are good reasons for thinking that the notations we need to capture significant syntactic generalisations will characterise CF-PSGs, or some minor generalisations of them, such as Indexed Grammars.&amp;quot; Linguistics, Volume 10, Numbers 3-4, July-December 1984 Paul M. Postal and D. Terence Langendoen English and the Class of Context-Free Languages But as Langendoen and Postal (1984) shows, NLs are proper classes not sets, so the question of WF(L)s as wholes being CF no longer arises. Restricting attention to FWF(L)s, the result of Section 2 shows that for any E of English for which MC holds, not CF. Since, however, neither FWF(E) nor any other FWF(L) has been shown to lie outside the domain of indexed languages (ILs) in the sense of Aho (1968), it would appear that one can conclude that while the collection of all sentences in an NL K is a proper class, FWF(K) is an IL. Consequently, a correct account of NL grammars must be such that a proper grammar for K specifies K as appropriate proper and entails that FWF(K) is A theory with just these properties remains to be constructed. &apos;appropriate&apos;, we mean one which satisfies inter alia the axiom called Closure Under Coordinate Compounding of Sentences in Langendoen and Postal (1984: 53). This is necessary for the proof that NLs are proper classes.</abstract>

A copying language is any language of the form: L cxdxe I x E (a,b)* and a,b,c,d,e are fixed strings} Given that English contains a sluicing construction characterized as in section 1, one can prove that FWF(E), E ranging over El and E2, is not CF by means of the Intersection Theorem of (2) and the fact that copying languages are not CF (Langendoen 1977).

R = {Joe discussed some bourbon x but WHICH bourbon y is unknown I x,y E (hater, lover)*} Since R is a concatenation of regular languages, it is itself regular. Now consider the intersection of R with FWF(E). The matching condition on sluicing constructions guarantees that this intersection is the copying language I in (19): 19. I = {Joe discussed some bourbon x but WHICH bourbon x is unknown I x,y E (hater, lover)*} Since I is not CP, by the Intersec</context>

These authors conclude, justifiably we believe, that for one or the other of the reasons mentioned above, none of these attempts, including those by the present authors, stand up.

This work shows that for any L, WF(L) is a proper class, hence not a set, much less a recursively enumerable set. There is thus no question of WF(L) being CF. Moreover, WF(L) can then have no constructive characterization (generative grammar), although there is no reason to doubt that it can be given a nonconstructive characterization.

Restricting attention to FWF(L)s, the result of Section 2 shows that for any dialect E of English for which MC holds, FWF(E) is not CF. Since, however, neither FWF(E) nor any other FWF(L) has been shown to lie outside the domain of indexed languages (ILs) in the sense of Aho (1968), it would appear that one can conclude that while the collection of all sentences in an NL K is a proper class, FWF(K) is an IL.

The Sluicing Construction The present demonstration that FWF(E), E ranging over various forms of English, is not CF is based on the sluicing construction, first discussed by Ross (1969) and more recently by van Riemsdijk (1978) and Levin (1982).

Two sorts of criticisms can be, and have been, directed at such attempted demonstrations. One attacks the mathematical foundations and argues, for particular choices of P, that a collection manifesting P is not necessarily not CF. The other type of criticism admits that if a collection manifests a particular property P, it is thereby not CF, but contends that the WF(L)s claimed to manifest P in fact don&apos;t.

It follows that the demonstration just presented holds not only for El and E2 but more generally for any variant of English whose matching condition for sluicing, even if different from that of both El and E2 for the full collection of English sentences, has the same extension for the language R of (18). We see no current reason to doubt that this will include every variant of English. 3.
