Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.969675833333333">
Present-day sentence generators are often in-
capable of producing a wide variety of well-
formed elliptical versions of coordinated
clauses, in particular, of combined elliptical
phenomena (Gapping, Forward and Back-
ward Conjunction Reduction, etc.). The ap-
plicability of the various types of clausal co-
ordinate ellipsis (CCE) presupposes detailed
comparisons of the syntactic properties of
the coordinated clauses. These nonlocal
comparisons argue against approaches based
on local rules that treat CCE structures as
special cases of clausal coordination. We
advocate an alternative approach where CCE
rules take the form of postediting rules ap-
plicable to nonelliptical structures. The ad-
vantage is not only a higher level of modu-
larity but also applicability to languages be-
longing to different language families. We
describe a language-neutral module (called
Elleipo; implemented in JAVA) that gener-
ates as output all major CCE versions of co-
ordinated clauses. Elleipo takes as input
linearly ordered nonelliptical coordinated
clauses annotated with lexical identity and
coreferentiality relationships between words
and word groups in the conjuncts. We dem-
onstrate the feasibility of a single set of
postediting rules that attains multilingual
coverage.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999345384615385">
In present-day Natural-Language Generation
(NLG) architectures, elision rules typically form
part of the Aggregation component, i.e. of the
module that decides how to group conceptual
messages into a sentence—a module belonging
to the Microplanner (cf. Reiter &amp; Dale, 2000,
for an authoritative overview of sentence and
text generation technology). In such generators,
the computation of coordinate structures takes
place at a relatively early stage of syntactic
processing. However, many types of clausal co-
ordinate ellipsis (CCE) require detailed com-
parisons of the final syntactic shape of the coor-
dinated clauses (conjuncts). This is even more
true when it is desirable to combine elision con-
structions, as in German example (1a), where
Subgapping—a form of Gapping—combines
with Backward Conjunction Reduction (for
definitions and examples see Table 1). Example
(1) also illustrates that often more than one el-
liptical option is available: (1b) shows a variant
with Subgapping alone. If the nonelliptical sen-
tence generator would choose a different Verb
order in the second conjunct (‘gestutzt werden
sollen’ as in (1d)), then Subgapping would be
the sole alternative.

The comparisons between the clausal con-
juncts mainly pertain to the linear order of their
major constituents and to identity relations be-
tween the lexical material contained in them.
For instance, if a right-peripheral string of lexi-
cal items in the anterior conjunct is identical to
such a string in the posterior conjunct, then
Backward Conjunction Reduction licenses eli-
sion of the former string. In (1a), the two one-
word strings ‘werden’ meet this requirement.
Language-typological work, e.g. the recent
survey by Haspelmath (2007), provides another
argument for a “late” CCE component. The
main phenomena can be categorized into a small
number of basic types, which have been attested
in languages belonging to different language

families. This suggests the possibility of a multi-
lingual approach to CCE where the main CCE
processes are defined as procedures that are iso-
lated from the “normal” grammar rules for
nonelliptical structures, and are independent
from each other (see Section 4).
Instead of having an aggregation component
where the rules for nonelliptical clausal coordi-
nate structures are intermingled with rules for
elliptical variants, we consider an alternative
approach where the application of the ellipsis
rules is deferred until the nonelliptical structures
have been completed. That is, the elision options
are calculated and executed during a postediting
stage, after the strategic and tactic components
of the generator have delivered the nonelliptical
versions. We claim that this modular approach
facilitates the development of multilingual CCE
components for different languages by switch-
ing on and off the individual CCE procedures
(e.g. no Gapping in Japanese).
The structure of the paper is as follows. In
Section 2, we introduce the four main CCE phe-
nomena and informally define their treatment in
a procedural manner. Section 3 lays out the ba-
sic postediting rules that we implemented in
JAVA as a language-neutral algorithm (nick-
named Elleipo, which means ‘I leave out’ in
classical Greek). In Section 4, we present some
findings from language-typological studies and
explore their implications for potential multilin-
gual applicability of Elleipo. Finally, in section
5, we draw some conclusions.
The Elleipo version described here embodies
several important improvements to a version
described briefly in Harbusch &amp; Kempen
(2006), particularly with respect to Subject Gap
in clauses with Finite/Fronted Verbs (SGF).
Moreover, the space allowed here enables us to
explain Elleipo’s inner workings in more detail,
and to demonstrate its multilingual potential.

Treatments of the phenomena of clausal coordi-
nation and CCE are provided by all major
grammar formalisms. Some representative stud-
ies are Sarkar &amp; Joshi (1996) for Tree Adjoining
Grammar; Steedman (2000) for Combinatory
Categorial Grammar; Bresnan (2000) and Frank
(2002) for Lexical-Functional Grammar; Crys-
mann (2003) and Beavers &amp; Sag (2004) for
Head-driven Phrase-Structure Grammar; and te
Velde (2005) for the Minimalist Program. Their
treatments of CCE take the form of special de-
clarative coordination rules, in contrast with the
modular and procedural approach we propose.
In the NLG community, modular treatments
of CCE—implemented as programs that take
unreduced coordinations expressed in the sys-
tem’s grammar formalism as input and return
elliptical versions as output—have been elabo-
rated in several projects (Shaw, 1998; Dalianis,
1999; Hielkema, 2005). These systems are lim-
ited in that that they do not cover all of the four
CCE processes and are monolingual.

2.2 Clausal coordinate ellipsis types
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999968">
In the linguistic literature on clausal coordinate
ellipsis, four main CCE processes are often dis-
tinguished, as shown in Table 1.
In the theoretical framework by Kempen
(2009) and its implementations (Harbusch &amp;
Kempen (2006) for German and Dutch; Har-
busch et al. (2009) for Estonian), the elision
process is guided by identity constraints and
linear order (cf. column 4 in Table 1). We dis-
tinguish three basic types of identity relations
between words or word groups (constituents)
belonging to different conjuncts1:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.997567636363636">
(1) Lemma identity: two different words be-
long to the same inflectional paradigm; e.g.
the Verbs ‘live’ and ‘lives’ in example (2).
(2) Form identity: two words have the same
spelling/sound and are lemma-identical;
e.g., two tokens of ‘want’ are form-
identical if they are both Verbs, but not if
one is a Verb and the other is a Noun.
(3) Coreferentiality: two words/constituents
denote the same entity or entities in the ex-
ternal context, i.e. have the same reference.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.934839588235294">
1 Very often, lemma- and form identity coincide with
coreference, but not necessarily. For instance, in ‘John
bought a car in July, and Peter bought a car in August,’
the two tokens of ‘a car’ are not, in all likelihood, corefer-
ential. Nevertheless, elision of ‘a car’ is allowed in this
Gapping example. In the semantic literature, this relation is
called sloppy identity. On the other hand, in ‘Who wants
coffee and who wants tea?,’ the two tokens of ‘who’ are
not coreferential, and the second token cannot be elided.
We assume that the strategic and/or the tactical component
of the generator assigns differing identity tags (see Section
3.1) to lemma- or form-identical constituents if and only if
their reference is strictly non-identical. Also note that, in
the following, the three identity relationships will not only
be applied to individual words but also to constituents en-
tirely consisting of words that meet the respective criteria
(cf. the numerical subscripts in Figure 1 in Section 3).

<bodyText confidence="0.999659631578947">
As summarized in column 4 of Table 1, all
forms of Gapping (i.e. including LDG, Subgap-
ping and Stripping) are characterized by elision
of the posterior member of a paired lemma-
identical Verb. The position of this Verb need
not be peripheral but is often medial, as in ex-
amples (2) through (5), and (9). Non-elided con-
stituents in the posterior conjunct are called
remnants. All remnants should pair up with a
constituent in the anterior conjunct that has the
same grammatical function but is not coreferen-
tial. Stated differently, the members of such a
pair are contrastive—in (2): the Subjects ‘Ulf’
vs. ‘his children’, and the locative Modifiers ‘in
Leipzig’ vs. ‘in Ulm.’ (Notice that although two
tokens of ‘my’ in (3) occupy comparable posi-
tions in the two conjuncts, it is not possible to
elide any of them. On the other hand, ‘were’ in
(4) can be elided from the posterior conjunct
although it has no literal anterior counterpart.)
In LDG, the remnants originate from different
clauses (more precisely: different clauses that
belong to the same superclause; term defined in
Section 3.2.1). In (3), ‘my son’ belongs to the
main clause but ‘a motorcycle’ to the infinitival
complement clause. In Subgapping, the poste-
rior conjunct includes a remnant in the form of a
nonfinite complement clause (VP; ‘severely
wounded’ in (4)). In Stripping, the posterior
conjunct is left with one non-Verb remnant, of-
ten supplemented by the Adverb ‘too.’
In Forward Conjunction Reduction (FCR),
elision affects the posterior token of a pair of
left-peripheral strings consisting of one or more
form-identical major constituents. In (6) and (7),
the posterior tokens of ‘since two years, my sis-
ter’ and ‘where,’ respectively, belong to such
pairs and are eligible for FCR.

<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.588059">
Backward Conjunction Reduction (BCR) is

<bodyText confidence="0.975289315789474">
almost the mirror image of FCR as it deletes the
anterior member of a pair of right-peripheral
lemma-identical word strings (‘o’clock’ in (9));
however, BCR may elide part of a major con-
stituent—e.g. only the part ‘article’ of the Direct
Object in (8) and ‘o’clock’ of the temporal
Modifier ‘before three o’clock’ in (9). In addi-
tion, it requires only lemma identity—witness
examples like (8).2
Subject Gap in clauses with Finite/Fronted
Verbs (SGF) can elide the Subject of the poste-
rior conjunct when in the anterior conjunct the
form-identical Subject follows the Verb (Sub-
ject-Verb inversion); moreover, the Head Verbs
of the conjoined clauses—both with main or
interrogative clause word order—are different.
(FCR cannot have caused the absence of the
posterior Subject since the anterior Subject is
not left-peripheral.) The examples in (11)

the unreduced clauses must meet certain special

identical Modifiers (12) but not form-identical

ments (14). Additionally, if FCR is licensed, as

In this Section, we describe Elleipo’s algorithm
in more detail than we were able to in Harbusch
&amp; Kempen (2006), again using the German ex-
ample (15). Moreover, we elaborate on SGF,
given the new, more detailed rules. We limit
ourselves to ‘and’-coordinations of only n=2
conjuncts. Actually, Elleipo can handle n-ary
coordinations consisting of n≥2 conjuncts by
processing n–1 consecutive pairs of conjuncts
(1+2, 2+3, etc.), together with an asyndeton rule
that replaces non-final ‘and’-s by commas.

Elleipo’s functioning is based on the assump-
tion that CCE does not result from the applica-
tion of local declarative grammar rules for
clause formation but from a procedural compo-
nent that inspects nonelliptical (unreduced) sen-
tences produced by the sentence generator and
may block the overt expression of certain con-
stituents. Due to this feature, Elleipo can be
combined, at least in principle, with various
generators. However, the module needs a for-
malism-dependent interface that converts gen-
erator output to a (simple) canonical form.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.960004">
3.1 Elleipo’s input
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999575">
Elleipo takes as input nonelliptical syntactic
trees in canonical form, supplied with identity
tags (cf. Figure 1). Every categorial node of an
input tree is immediately dominated by a func-
tional node. Each conjunct is rooted in a cate-
gorial node whose daughter nodes (immediate
constituents) are grammatical functions (Sub-
ject, Direct Object, Head, Subordinating Con-
junction, Expr(ession), etc.). Within a conjunct,
all major constituents are represented at the
same hierarchical level (“flat” trees).
Categorial nodes are adorned with numerical
identity tags (ID-tags) which express lemma
identity. In Figure 1, the ID “2” is attached to
the head node of both exemplars of AP ‘heute’
‘today’, thus marking their lemma identity. In
contrast, the Subject NPs ‘Hans’ and ‘Susi’
carry different ID-tags, indicating that they are
not lemma-identical and cannot be elided by any
CCE process.

3.2 The three stages of Elleipo
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.983229">
Elleipo is called for every coordination domain
within a non-elliptical input clause. We define a
coordination domain as a (sub)tree rooting in a
grammatical function node that dominates two
or more categorial S-nodes separated by coordi-
nating conjunctions (‘and’). For any given coor-
dination domain, Elleipo’s task consists of three
consecutive stages: Preparation, Diagnosis, and
ReadOut.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.812936">
3.2.1 Preparation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999352">
The first job within Preparation is the demarca-
tion of superclauses. Kempen (2009) introduced
this notion in the treatment of Gapping, in par-
ticular LDG. A superclause is either a simple
finite or non-finite clause (rooting in an S-node,
without any subordinate clauses), or a hierarchy
of finite or non-finite clauses where every em-
bedded clause is an immediate daughter of an
embedding clause; moreover, none of the par-
ticipating clauses begins with a subordinating

conjunction, with the possible exception of the
topmost member of the hierarchy.3
Next, Elleipo inspects and compares the con-
tent of the conjoined clauses by assembling four
lists: FUNC-PAIRS, LI-FUNC-PAIRS,
LPERIPH and RPERIPH (see Table 2). The lists
FUNC-PAIRS and LI-FUNC-PAIRS are crucial
not only in calculating whether a form of Gap-
ping is applicable but also in the determination
of contrastiveness of Gapping remnants. We
presuppose a division of MODifier constituents
into MOD types—locative (LMOD), temporal
(TMOD, causal (CMOD), etc.—which are re-
corded in the two lists of pairs. Gapping requires
the set of grammatical functions, including
MOD types, in the anterior and posterior con-
juncts to be identical. If so, and if FUNC-PAIRS
includes at least one pair of non-coreferential
members (carrying different ID-tags), the Boo-
lean variable CONTRAST is set to true. In the
example, FUNC-PAIRS(S0, S11) includes two
pairs of non-coreferential major constituents
(the Subjects and the Complements); hence,
CONTRAST = true. LPERIPH is crucial in
FCR, where only complete form-identical major
constituents may be elided. RPERIPH is used in
BCR, which sometimes leaves incomplete con-
stituents behind, as exemplified by (8) and (9).
3 The “embedded” clauses referred to in the definition of
superclause fulfill the grammatical function of Subject or
Object Complement within the embedding clause, or they
are adverbial clauses fulfilling the function of Modifier
within the embedding clause. In Figure 1, the Complement
clauses S6 and S14 are major constituents of S0 and S11,
respectively. The hierarchy spanning S0 and S6 is a super-
clause, and so is the hierarchy consisting of S11 and S14. In
‘Hans sagte, dass Susi ihr Fahrrad putzen wird’ ‘Hans said
that Susi will clean her bike,’ the Complement clause does
not belong to the same superclause as the main clause
‘Hans sagte ...,’ but instead starts up its own superclause.
Gapping and its varieties can only be applied to two coor-
dinated superclauses.

For each of the four CCE processes, Elleipo in-
spects all coordination domains for elision op-
tions. This requires interpreting the lists col-
lected during the Preparation stage. Any li-
censed elision option for a word or constituent
causes the current value of the parameter CCE-
TYPE to be added as a tag to that word or con-
stituent (cf. the subscripts in examples (2)
through (10)). Different elliptical variants (cf.
examples (1a/b)) are represented by multiple
tags and yield alternative realizations, to be
spelled out during the final ReadOut stage. If the
Boolean variable CONTRAST is true, Gapping
runs recursively within the current coordination
domain. Figure 2 shows pseudocode for Gap-
ping, with input parameters LC = left conjunct,
RC=right conjunct, and CCE-TYPE=g). In the
example: GAPPING(S0, S11, “g”).
Lemma identity of the Head Verbs of the
clausal conjuncts licenses Gapping. So, the tem-
poral Adverbial Modifier and the Head Verb of
the posterior conjunct can both be marked for
elision: ‘Heute wird Hans sein Auto putzen und
heuteg wirdg Susi ihr Fahrrad putzen’ (steps 8
and 9). Earlier on, in step 3 and 4, Elleipo has
already noticed that one of the non-lemma-
identical pairs—S6 and S14—consists of Com-
plement clauses belonging to the same super-
clause as the coordinated main clauses (i.e. they
do not start up a new superclause hierarchy). In
step 6, Elleipo is called recursively for this co-
ordinate subdomain, with argument CCE-TYPE
set to “gg”. As the Head Verbs of these com-
plement clauses are lemma-identical and the
contrastiveness condition holds (i.e. the gram-
matical function DOBJ occurs in both the ante-
rior and the posterior complement and the ex-
emplars are not lemma-identical), the posterior
Verb is marked for elision, yielding ‘Heute wird

FCR and BCR are both executed by one proce-
dure, called CR. In FCR mode, CR is called with
the value of LPERIPH as input; in BCR mode, it
takes RPERIPH’s value as input. Recall that these
lists were computed in the Preparation stage and
may contain a form-identical (LPERIPH) or a
lemma-identical (RPERIPH) lexical string. In
calls to CR (see the pseudocode in Figure 3), pa-
rameter PERIPH is set to LPERIPH or RPERIPH,
and CCE-TYPE to “b” or “f” depending on
whether BCR or FCR is to be executed. In our
example, the main program calls are:
CR(S0, S11, LPERIPH(S0, S11), “f”), and
CR(S0, S11, RPERIPH(S0, S11), “b”).
FCR and BCR are attempted after, and fully in-
dependently from, Gapping, irrespective of
whether the latter was successful or not. As Modi-
fier ‘heute’ and Head Verb ‘wird’ are both listed
in LPERIPH(S0, S11), both major constituents are
marked as eligible for elision from the posterior
conjunct (line 6 of Figure 3)Ñan effect which
happens to coincide with the effects of Gapping:

<bodyText confidence="0.999967333333333">
The resulting terminal string annotated with eli-
sion marks is handed over to the ReadOut stage.
As ReadOut assumes that all elisions are optional,
it may deliver more than one elliptical output
string. However, not every possible combination
of elisions is legitimate; certain combinations
have to be ruled out. We mention four important
restrictions here. First, Gapping and BCR cannot
elide both tokens of a lexical item. For instance, if
‘putzen’ in the anterior conjunct of (15) is elided
due to BCR, then its posterior counterpart
‘putzen,’ which could be Gapped, should re-
main—and vice-versa. Second, in LDG, if a Verb
with n subscripts “g” is elided, then all Verbs with
m&gt;n subscripts “g” should be elided as well.
Third, in Gapping, if only one non-Head-Verb
constituent remains (i.e. Stripping), then (the lan-
guage-specific equivalent of) the Adverb ‘too’ is
added. Fourth, SGF requires that FCR, if licensed,
is actually executed. Moreover, the ReadOut stage
performs certain types of embellishments, e.g. it
applies an asyndeton rule that replaces all but the
last token of the coordinating conjunction by
commas.

3.4 Elleipo evaluated for German
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99996">
A detailed evaluation of Elleipo is currently only
available for the German version (Harbusch &amp;
Kempen, 2007). In the TIGER corpus with 50,000
sentences, 99 percent of the CCE sentences con-
form to Elleipo’s CCE rules. Nevertheless, we are
aware that these rules do not handle SGF in con-
joined subordinate clauses where the first conjunct
has the standard Verb-final word order but the
second conjunct (with SGF) embodies Verb-
second order. Furthermore, Elleipo does not take
into account certain semantic constraints (“one-
event semantics”; Reich, in press; see also Frank,
2002; Kempen, 2009). Another insufficiency con-
cerns the rules for asyndeton, which are more
complicated than simply converting prefinal
‘and’-s to commas (see Borsley (2005) for perti-
nent examples).

4.1 CCE rules in typological studies
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999951068965517">
The four CCE processes have been attested in two
Germanic languages (German and Dutch) and in a
Finno-Ugric language (Estonian; Harbusch et al.,
2009), where they account for a wide range of
CCE phenomena. This invites the prediction that
CCE obeys the same rules in many other lan-
guages as well. However, Haspelmath’s (2007)
survey immediately falsifies this prediction: Other
CCE processes may be at work in other languages,
and/or some of the above four main processes
may be absent.
Japanese may provide illustrations of both
points. On the one hand, it is uncontroversial that
it does not have Gapping. On the other hand, it
may have a form of CCE that stands midway be-
tween FCR and BCR. Yatabe (2001) interprets
(16) as Left Node Raising, i.e. as the mirror image
of BCR. Like FCR, it elides a left-peripheral
string of the posterior conjunct; like BCR, the
elided string need not be a complete major con-
stituent. The elided Verb yonde is part of the
prenominal Relative clause yonde agenakatta
which is a major constituent (immediate daughter)
of the NP headed by the Noun hito. But notice that
(16) embodies coordination of NPs rather than
clauses. If Japanese indeed exhibits partial elision
of left-peripheral major constituents at the clausal
level, thus violating our FCR definition, then we
obviously need to define an additional CCE type.

In contrast, Abe &amp; Hoshi (1997) analyze Japa-
nese example (17) in terms of Preposition Strand-
ing. As far as we can see, this structure does not
require a special CCE process because Elleipo
treats it as BCR, which allows partial elision of
the PP Modifier in the anterior conjunct, hence
stranding of the Preposition.

Haspelmath (2007) also discusses certain lan-
guages with Subject–Object–Verb (SOV) as basic
word order (Turkish and Korean) which allow
Object deletion from non-peripheral positions in
the posterior conjunct; i.e., they license the pattern
SOV&amp;S_V, as in ‘The-boy the-cart pulled and
the-girl the cart pushed.’ Elleipo cannot handle

this CCE structure: FCR and BCR require pe-
ripherality of the elided constituent; SGF only
applies to Subjects; and Gapping presupposes eli-
sion of the Head Verb. In order to encompass the
problematic pattern, we may need to define a new
CCE process. However, at least in Turkish
SOV&amp;S_V cases, the elision may be due to prag-
matic factors. Gšksel &amp; Kerslake (2005) show
that major clause constituents fulfilling diverse
grammatical functions can be elided as long their
referents are recoverable on the basis of the ac-
companying linguistic or nonlinguistic context.
Because the anterior conjunct may provide such a
context, one first needs to rule out contextual re-
coverability as the licensing factor.
At the same time, Haspelmath also shows that
Elleipo’s four CCE processes cover a high propor-
tion of CCE patterns occurring cross-linguisti-
cally. (However, he does not discuss SGF.) A
typical illustration is the set of nine “more widely
attested patterns” of CCE that he enumerates with
respect to elision of Objects or Verbs in four lan-
guage groups with different basic word orders of
S, O and V (Table 2 in Haspelmath, 2007). All
these patterns are covered by our four CCE proc-
esses, except SOV&amp;S_V.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999985466666667">
We conclude that a software module embodying
Elleipo’s four main CCE processes—maybe with
relatively minor adjustments—will be able to gen-
erate a great deal of CCE structures for many dif-
ferent languages.
As for possible practical applications, Elleipo’s
status as a postprocessor working on input specifi-
cations of unreduced syntactic structures facili-
tates combinability with sentence generators based
on various grammar formalisms. Even template-
based message generators, such as used in car
navigation and weather forecast systems, can at-
tain higher levels of fluency and conciseness if the
templates are annotated with syntactic structure
and ID-tags.

<abstract confidence="0.997476225806452">Present-day sentence generators are often incapable of producing a wide variety of wellformed elliptical versions of coordinated clauses, in particular, of combined elliptical phenomena (Gapping, Forward and Backward Conjunction Reduction, etc.). The applicability of the various types of clausal coordinate ellipsis (CCE) presupposes detailed comparisons of the syntactic properties of the coordinated clauses. These nonlocal comparisons argue against approaches based on local rules that treat CCE structures as special cases of clausal coordination. We advocate an alternative approach where CCE rules take the form of postediting rules applicable to nonelliptical structures. The advantage is not only a higher level of modularity but also applicability to languages belonging to different language families. We describe a language-neutral module (called Elleipo; implemented in JAVA) that generates as output all major CCE versions of coordinated clauses. Elleipo takes as input linearly ordered nonelliptical coordinated clauses annotated with lexical identity and coreferentiality relationships between words and word groups in the conjuncts. We demonstrate the feasibility of a single set of postediting rules that attains multilingual coverage.</abstract>

Section 3 lays out the basic postediting rules that we implemented in JAVA as a language-neutral algorithm (nicknamed Elleipo, which means ‘I leave out’ in classical Greek). In Section 4, we present some findings from language-typological studies and explore their implications for potential multilingual applicability of Elleipo. Finally, in section 5, we draw some conclusions. The Elleipo version described here embodies several important improvements to a version described briefly in Harbusch &amp; Kempen (2006), particularly with respect to Subject Gap in clauses with Finite/Fronted Verbs (SGF).

Moreover, we elaborate on SGF, given the new, more detailed rules. We limit ourselves to ‘and’-coordinations of only n=2 conjuncts. Actually, Elleipo can handle n-ary coordinations consisting of n≥2 conjuncts by processing n–1 consecutive pairs of conjuncts (1+2, 2+3, etc.), together with an asyndeton rule that replaces non-final ‘and’-s by commas.

Fourth, SGF requires that FCR, if licensed, is actually executed.

Die Bäume sollen gefällt werden und gestutzt werden sollen die Sträucher The comparisons between the clausal conjuncts mainly pertain to the linear order of their major constituents and to identity relations between the lexical material contained in them. For instance, if a right-peripheral string of lexical items in the anterior conjunct is identical to such a string in the posterior conjunct, then Backward Conjunction Reduction licenses elision of the former string. In (1a), the two oneword strings ‘werden’ meet this requirement. Language-typological work, e.g. the recent survey by Haspelmath (2007), provides another argument for a “late” CCE component. The main phenomena can be categorized into a small number of basic types, which have been attested in languages belonging to different language Proceedings of the 12th European Workshop on Natural Language Generation, pages 138–145, Athens, Greece, 30 – 31 March 2009. c�2009 Association for Computational Linguistics 138 families.

As far as we can see, this structure does not require a special CCE process because Elleipo treats it as BCR, which allows partial elision of the PP Modifier in the anterior conjunct, hence stranding of the Preposition. (17) John-ga Bill[-nituite hanasita]b, sosite John-Nom Bill -about talked and Mary-ga Susan-nituite hanasita Mary-Nom Susan-about talked ‘John talked about Bill and Mary about Susan’ Haspelmath (2007) also discusses certain languages with Subject–Object–Verb (SOV) as basic word order (Turkish and Korean) which allow Object deletion from non-peripheral positions in the posterior conjunct; i.e., they license the pattern SOV&amp;S_V, as in ‘The-boy the-cart pulled and the-girl the cart pushed.’ Elleipo cannot handle 144 this CCE structure: FCR and BCR require peripherality of the elided constituent; SGF only applies to Subjects; and Gapping presupposes elision of the Head Verb.

Because the anterior conjunct may provide such a context, one first needs to rule out contextual recoverability as the licensing factor. At the same time, Haspelmath also shows that Elleipo’s four CCE processes cover a high proportion of CCE patterns occurring cross-linguistically. (However, he does not discuss SGF.) A typical illustration is the set of nine “more widely attested patterns” of CCE that he enumerates with respect to elision of Objects or Verbs in four language groups with different basic word orders of S, O and V (Table 2 in Haspelmath, 2007). All these patterns are covered by our four CCE processes, except SOV&amp;S_V. 5 Discussion We conclude that a software module embodying Elleipo’s four main CCE processes—maybe with relatively minor adjustments—will be able to generate a great deal of CCE structures for many different languages. As for possible practical applications, Elleipo’s status as a postprocessor working on input specifications of unreduced syntactic structures facilitates combinability with sentence generators based on various grammar formalisms.

We define a coordination domain as a (sub)tree rooting in a grammatical function node that dominates two or more categorial S-nodes separated by coordinating conjunctions (‘and’). For any given coordination domain, Elleipo’s task consists of three consecutive stages: Preparation, Diagnosis, and ReadOut. 3.2.1 Preparation The first job within Preparation is the demarcation of superclauses. Kempen (2009) introduced this notion in the treatment of Gapping, in particular LDG. A superclause is either a simple finite or non-finite clause (rooting in an S-node, without any subordinate clauses), or a hierarchy of finite or non-finite clauses where every embedded clause is an immediate daughter of an embedding clause; moreover, none of the participating clauses begins with a subordinating 141 Figure 1.

Elleipo takes as input linearly ordered nonelliptical coordinated clauses annotated with lexical identity and coreferentiality relationships between words and word groups in the conjuncts. We demonstrate the feasibility of a single set of postediting rules that attains multilingual coverage. 1 Introduction In present-day Natural-Language Generation (NLG) architectures, elision rules typically form part of the Aggregation component, i.e. of the module that decides how to group conceptual messages into a sentence—a module belonging to the Microplanner (cf. Reiter &amp; Dale, 2000, for an authoritative overview of sentence and text generation technology). In such generators, the computation of coordinate structures takes place at a relatively early stage of syntactic processing. However, many types of clausal coordinate ellipsis (CCE) require detailed comparisons of the final syntactic shape of the coordinated clauses (conjuncts). This is even more true when it is desirable to combine elision constructions, as in German example (1a), where Subgapping—a form of Gapping—combines with Backward Conjunction Reduction (for definitions and examples see Table 1).

(2009) for Estonian), the elision process is guided by identity constraints and linear order (cf. column 4 in Table 1). We distinguish three basic types o</context>

Moreover, the space allowed here enables us to explain Elleipo’s inner workings in more detail, and to demonstrate its multilingual potential. 2 Clausal coordinate ellipsis (CCE) 2.1 Clausal coordinate ellipsis in linguistic theories and in NLG: State of the art Treatments of the phenomena of clausal coordination and CCE are provided by all major grammar formalisms. Some representative studies are Sarkar &amp; Joshi (1996) for Tree Adjoining Grammar; Steedman (2000) for Combinatory Categorial Grammar; Bresnan (2000) and Frank (2002) for Lexical-Functional Grammar; Crysmann (2003) and Beavers &amp; Sag (2004) for Head-driven Phrase-Structure Grammar; and te Velde (2005) for the Minimalist Program. Their treatments of CCE take the form of special declarative coordination rules, in contrast with the modular and procedural approach we propose. In the NLG community, modular treatments of CCE—implemented as programs that take unreduced coordinations expressed in the system’s grammar formalism as input and return elliptical versions as output—have been elaborated i</context>

This invites the prediction that CCE obeys the same rules in many other languages as well. However, Haspelmath’s (2007) survey immediately falsifies this prediction: Other CCE processes may be at work in other languages, and/or some of the above four main processes may be absent. Japanese may provide illustrations of both points. On the one hand, it is uncontroversial that it does not have Gapping. On the other hand, it may have a form of CCE that stands midway between FCR and BCR. Yatabe (2001) interprets (16) as Left Node Raising, i.e. as the mirror image of BCR. Like FCR, it elides a left-peripheral string of the posterior conjunct; like BCR, the elided string need not be a complete major constituent. The elided Verb yonde is part of the prenominal Relative clause yonde agenakatta which is a major constituent (immediate daughter) of the NP headed by the Noun hito. But notice that (16) embodies coordination of NPs rather than clauses. If Japanese indeed exhibits partial elision of left-peripheral major constituents at the clausal level, thus violating our FCR definition, then we ob</context>
