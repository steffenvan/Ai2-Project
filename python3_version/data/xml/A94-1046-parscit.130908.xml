<bodyText confidence="0.999023529411765">
Industrial applications of a reversible,
string-based, unification approach called
Humor (High-speed Unification Morphol-
ogy) is introduced in the paper. It has
been used for creating a variety of proofing
tools and dictionaries, like spelling check-
ers, hyphenators, lemmatizers, inflectional
thesauri, intelligent bi-lingual dictionaries
and, of course, full morphological analysis
and synthesis. The first industrialized ver-
sions of all of the above modules work and
licensed by well-known software companies
for their products&apos; Hungarian versions. De-
velopment of the same modules for other
agglutinative (e.g. Turkish, Estonian) and
other (highly) inflectional languages (e.g.
Polish, French, German) have also begun.

1.1 Morphological Analysis/Synthesis and
Lemmatizing
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999947714285714">
The morphological analyser is the kernel module of
the system: almost all of the applications derived
from Humor based on it. It provides all the possible
segmentations of the word-form in question cover-
ing inflections, derivations, prefixations, compound-
ing and creating basic lexical forms of the stems.
Morphological synthesis is based on analysis, that
is, all the possible morphemic combinations built by
the core synthesis module are filtered by the ana-
lyzer.
Lemmatizer is a simplified version of the morpho-
logical analysis system. It provides all the possible
lexical stems of a word-form, but does not provide
inflectional and derivational information.

1.2 Spelling Checking and Correction
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999675">
Spelling checking of agglutinative languages cannot
be based on simple wordlist based method because
of the incredibly high number of possible word-forms
of these languages. Algorithmic solutions, that is
morphology based applications, are the only way to
solve the problem (Solak and Oflazer 1992). The
spelling checker based on our unification morphology
method provides a logical answer whether the word-
form in question can be constructed according to the
actual morphological descriptions of the system, or
not. In case of negative answer a correction strategy
starts to work. It is based on orthographic, morpho-
phonological, morphological and lexical properties of
the words. This strategy also works in real corpus
applications where automatic corrections of some
typical mis-typings have to be made.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.995668">
1.3 Hyphenation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999988727272727">
There are languages in which 100% hyphenation
cannot be made without exact morphological seg-
mentation of the words. Hungarian is a language of
this type: boundaries between prefixes and stems,
or between the components of compounds override
the main hyphenation rules that cover around 85%
of the hyphenation points. Our unification based
hyphenator guarantees, in principle, perfect hyphen-
ation (including the critical Hungarian hyphenation
of long double consonants where new letters have to
be inserted while hyphenated).

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99579">
1.4 Mono- and Bi-lingual Dictionaries
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999851571428572">
Besides the above described well-known types of
applications there are two new tools based on
the same strategy, the inflectional thesaurus called
Helyette (Proszeky &amp; Tihanyi 1993), and the series
of intelligent bi-lingual dictionaries called MoBiDic.
Both are dictionaries with morphological knowledge:
Helyette is monolingual, while MoBiDic — as its
name suggests&apos; — bi-lingual. Having analyzed the
input word both systems look for the lemma in the
main dictionary. The inflectional thesaurus stores
the information encoded in the analyzed affixes, and
adds to the synonym chosen by the user. The mor-
phological synthesis module starts to work here, and
provides the user with the adequate inflected form

2 Implementation Details
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998234">
Humor unification morphology systems have been
fully implemented for Hungarian. The same pack-
age for Polish, Turkish, German, French are under
development. The whole software package is writ-
ten in standard C using C++ like objects. It runs
on any platforms where C compiler can be found.2
The Hungarian morphological analyzer which is
the largest and most precise implementation needs
around 100 Kbytes of core memory and 600 Kbytes
disk space for spell-checking and hyphenation (plus
300 Kbytes for full analysis and synthesis). The stem
dictionary contains more than 90.000 stems which
cover all (approx. 70.000) lexemes of the Concise
Explanatory Dictionary of the Hungarian Language.
Suffix dictionaries contain all the inflectional suf-
fixes and the productive derivational morphemes of
present-day Hungarian. With the help of these dic-
tionaries Humor is able to analyze and/or generate
around 2.000.000.000 well-formed Hungarian word-
forms. Its speed is between 50 and 100 words/s on
an average 40 MHz 386 machine. The whole system
can be tuned3 according to the speed requirements:
the needed RAM size can be between 50 and 900
Kbytes.
The synonym system of Helyette contains 40.000
headwords. The first version of the inflectional the-
saurus Helyette needs 1.6 Mbytes disk space and
runs under MS-Windows. The size of the MoBiDic
packages vary depending on the applied terminologi-
cal collection. E.g. the Hungarian-English Business
Dictionary needs 1.8 Mbytes space.4

There are several commercially available Humor sub-
systems for different purposes: lemmatizers, hy-
phenators, spelling checkers and correctors. They
(called HelyesLem, Helyesel and Helyes-e?, respec-
tively) have been built into several word-processing
and full-text retrieval systems.
Spelling checkers and hyphenators are available
either as a part of Microsoft Word for Windows,
Works, Excel, Lotus 1-2-3 and AmiPro, Aldus Page-
Maker, WordPerfect, etc. or in stand-alone form for
DOS, Windows and Macintosh. Microsoft and Lo-
tus licensed the above proofing tool packages for all
of their localized Hungarian products.

Humor-based lemmatizers support free text search

lexicographers of the Institute of Linguistics of the
Hungarian Academy of Sciences in their every-day
work. That is, the corpus used in creation of Histor-
ical Dictionary of Hungarian has been lemmatized
by tools based on our unification morphology.
