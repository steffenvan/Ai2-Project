A major problem In automatically analyzing the text of
military messages in order to synthesize data base ele-
ments Is separating fact from opinion, i.e., Identifying
factual statements versus evaluative commentary such
as degree of belief or confidence in the parameters of a
particular event, comparative evaluations of entitles and
events, predictions of future events, etc. This paper
describes a model which accounts for the range of fac-
tual to evaluative Information In the message traffic, and
discusses a means for representing such Information In
the context of an experimental system for automated
data base generation.

1.0 BACKGROUND

<bodyText confidence="0.999836207317074">
For several years, with some Interruptions, • research
and development effort has been In process In the
Operating Systems Division of Logicon (and Its prede-
cessor company, Operating Systems, Inc.) aimed at the
automated creation of data base elements from the text
.of electronically transmitted military messages.1 (Kuhns
and Montgomery 1073, Kuhns 1974, Kuhns et a11978,
Silva and Montgomery 1977, Sliva et al 1979a, 1979b,
Owiggins and Silva 19511 The objective of this
research has been to provide an automated capability to
supplement the presently largely manual, labor-intensive
task of maintaining the currency of data bases which
derive their information elements from the text of mili-
tary messages. Although some effort has been devoted
to primarily Interactive approaches to the problem, and
to messages which have highly predictable columnar
summary formats, the majority of the research and
development work has concentrated on the more difficult
task of analyzing unformatted narrative text with user
Interaction limited to occasional assistance to the
automated system.
A testbed system called MATRES has been constructed
In Prolog to run under the UNIX operating system on the
POP 11/70. MATRES Is a knowledge based system for
understanding the natural language text of event-
oriented massages In the domains of air activities and
space/missile (S&amp;M) activities. The knowledge struc-
tures in MATRES, called &amp;quot;templates&amp;quot;, are essentially
frames or scripts describing entities and events, which
answer the military user&apos;s basic questions about these

phenomena, as Illustrated In the simplified view of an
event template presented In Figure 1.
The templates are hierarchically organized; lower level
templates deal with objects or times, mid level with
events containing objects and times, higher level with
activities composed of events. The slots In the tem-
plates contain procedures which operate upon the out-
put of the Definite Clause Grammar (DCG) to Instantiate
the templates.
We are currently using a corpus of approximately 125
messages in the S&amp;M domain as. a basis for developing a
scenario for evaluation of the extended MATRES
toistbed, as well as a testbed for a related knowledge
based system, the Active/Introspective Information Sys-
tem (described In Montgomery and Ruspini 1981, and
Ruspinl 1982] for which MATRES serves as a front end.
The scenario involves two simulated nations, the Delta
Confederation of the Atlantic States and the Epsilon
Republic. Both nations have space programs, and each
Is Interested In monitoring the technological progress of
the other, using their own satellite and sensor resources
and those of other friendly nations. The set of mes-
sages to be analyzed by MATRES are mainly reports of
space and satellite launches and orbital activities of the
Delta Confederation, which are being monitored and
evaluated by the Epsilon Republic. The text of mes-
sages used In the scenario has the structure and format
of actual messages reporting on S&amp;M activities, although
the lexicon is substantially different.
As discussed in several previous technical reports
prepared under earlier contracts with RAOC ((Kuhns and
Montgomery 19731 (Silva at al 19794], [SING at al
1979b]), the subset of the English language on which
the text of intelligence messages Is based is essentially
a specialized language for reporting events. Intermixed
with factual statements reporting on entitles and
events, however, is much evaluative commentary. More-
over, press announcements of the Delta Confederation
are included In the reports, and evaluative comments are
made both about the events reported In the press
announcements and the announcements themselves. In
synthesizing data base elements from these messages,
It Is crucial to sort out these different levels of informa-
tion.
This paper defines an approach to Identifying and label-
ing these types of information so that they can be
exploited In the context of MATRES and the data base
systems which It serves.

<bodyText confidence="0.998004958333334">
As noted above, the subianguage of the message cor-
pora for the air activities and S&amp;M domains is essentially
a vehicle for reporting events. Kuhns and Montgomery
[1973] presented a detailed methodology for classifying
the various types of events described In the messages,
which Is shown In Figure 2, and summarized below.
Before describing the event classification, however, It Is
enlightening to review briefly some example messages In
order to understand the motivation for this rather com-
plex model.
Some messages — for example, those encountered In
our previous research on the air activities domain -- may
report only primitive events. However, as noted above
and Illustrated In Figure 3, a message may In fact be a
report of a report-- that is, It may Include s report of an
event by some other source than the originator of the
message. The &amp;quot;announcement&amp;quot; Is thus a report of a
&apos;launch&amp;quot; event, which Is the basic or primitive event
being reported. The &amp;quot;announcement&amp;quot; Is an event, but It
Is clearly not on the same level as the primitive event.
Rather, It 13 a report about the launch, a mets-event
that Incidentally Introduces a new Information source of
different credibility than the originator of the message.
However, this distinction alone 13 not sufficient to
account for the difference between the Initial two sen-
tences of the example message and the third sentence,
which contains an evaluation of the announcement, stat-
ing that It was characterized by &amp;quot;routine&amp;quot; wording. It Is
thus an evaluative commentary on the press announce-
ment of the launch event Since the announcement has
been defined as a meta-event, the comment represents
another meta-level. In fact, In reviewing additional
examples of the message traffic In this scenario, It Is
clear that, in order to accurately distill and represent
Information contained in the text of these messages, the
analytical methodology must identify and uniquely label
the following types of information:
Meta-events
Non-meta-events
Observational events
Primitive events
Attributive events
Relational events
World point events (location events)
World point qualification events
(location event qualifications)
Non-world point events, or events involving
two or more objects or locations

3.0 ANALYTICAL METHODOLOGY
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999950674698795">
This analytical methodology la based on a model of the
reel world situation which underlies the scenario. Part of
the model derives from the event classification schema
mentioned above, and Illustrated in Figure 2, which was
developed to account for the levels of content occuring
In the event-oriented message discourse. In this clas-
sification, there are two major types of events, mete
event, and non-meta events. Of the latter, events may
be observational, or primitive. An observational event
Is a direct perception of an event, which may be a visual
perception (e.g., &amp;quot;observe&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;sight&amp;quot;), or In the case of a
sensor, an electronic measurement of the emitted
energy characterizing the event. A primitive event is
thus a physical event of some kind which does not
Involve an observation or perception. Primitive events
may be attributive or relational. An attributive event
describes a situation In which a particular entity has a
particular attribute at a certain time or during a particu-
lar time Interval (other than the attribute location, which
Is covered under relational events), for example: &amp;quot;Ter-
rex 534 operates In the high density mode&amp;quot;. A relational
event Involves entities which stand In an n-ary relation
with each other at a certain time or during a fixed time
Period. The Importance of the subclasses of world point
and world point qualification events Is in defining the
world fine of an entity, say the track of a ship or subma-
rine. Of these distinctions, the most relevant for this
discussion are those Involving meta-events and non-
meta events, and of the latter, primitive versus obser-
vational events.
In terms of the scenario described above, a primitive
event may occur, say, a satellite launch by the Delta
Confederation, as illustrated In Figura 4. This event, like
any other event, involves the emission of energy. Such
an emission is perceived by a sensing device of the
Epsilon Republic. The device generates (down arrow) a
report of the given event, In terms of the particular
attributes of the event it Is designed to measure. This
sensor report Is an observational event, entailing an
observation of a primitive event. An SAM analyst for the
Epsilon Republic accesses (up arrow) this report, which
contains digitized Information generated by the sensor,
Interprets this Information as a launch event, and Issues
his own report about that event.
His report, which is an Interpretation of the primitive
event based on the observational event, Is a zeroth
order meta-everrt: the common denominator of the mes-
sage traffic. At the same time, the Deltas may release
an internal report about the launch, which would also
constitute a zeroth order meta-event. Based on that
report, the Delta press agency, NYT, may Issue an
announcement of the primitive event, the announcement
thus constitutes a first-order meta-event. An Epsilon
Republic reporter may then make an Interpretation of.
that announcement. In the form of a report, which —
being a report of a first-order meta-event -- is there-
fore a second order meta-event Corrections or other
changes made by Epsilon reporters to these messages
constitute a third meta level of reporting event, since
they may reference reports of reports of events.
The model thus far accounts for the event reporting
structure which underlies the Delta/Epsilon scenario, but
we must also account for the reporter&apos;s comments about
the event — La., his Interpretation or evaluation of the
event -- which can occur at any of these levels.
The reporter&apos;s goal is to Identify and describe all the
relevant parameters of an event (exemplified by the
Wets In the template for a launch event, shown In the
center of Figure 5) based on the observational report
produced by the sensor and any other Information he
may have (e.g., knowledge that a replacement of a non-
functioning communications satellite Is likely within a
given time frame). However, If the reporter&apos;s Information
Is Incomplete or Imprecise, ha cannot exactly describe
the parameters of an event, but will give his best
Interpretation of the event based on what he knows.
Thus he may report a launch of &amp;quot;an unidentified satel-
lite&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;a probable television support satellite&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;a Possi-
ble CE satellite&amp;quot;. In some cases, he may have enough
Information to make a comparative evaluation with launch
events which have occurred In the past: &amp;quot;a new ESV&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;the second CE satellite to be successfully orbited by
the Dente this year&amp;quot;. Still another type of meta lnfor-

If a repartees Information Is good, i.e., complete and pre-

However, when his Information Is Imprecise and his
knowledge can add Me to It, he must resort to the
qualified or meta-commented types of messages
described above.
In order to accommodate such qualified and meta-
commentary types of Information, each event template
may have associated with It one or more meta templates
containing Interpretive or evaluative Information. Thus,
as represented In Figure 5, an Instantiated launch tem-
plate produced from an observational event and a primi-
tive event (a zeroth order reporting event, as illustrated
In Figure 4) may have several additional qualifications
(exemplified by, but not limited to, the meta templates
Illustrated In the figure). So, for example, a meta
evaluative template2 associated with a launch template
expresses the Epsilon reporter&apos;s degree of belief or
confidence In the launch parameters he reports: the
object in the event template Is believed by the Epsilon
reporter to be a CE (or Crop Enhancement) satellite from
the information presented In the observational report by
the sensor, and from his own knowledge of past
occurrences of CE satellite launches, as well as expec-
tations of possible replacement launches, etc., during
particular time Intervals. All or one of the listed
parameters for a launch event may be qualified In this
way. Thus, In Figure 5, the Epsilon reporter believes
that, to the best of his knowledge, the space object
Involved in the major launch event Is a &amp;quot;probable&amp;quot; CE or
crap enhancement satellite, and that the time of launch
Is &amp;quot;approximately&amp;quot; 11302.
Each meta template has fields which Identify the source,
as well as the time and date of the Interpretive informa-
tion. As opposed to the &amp;quot;Intel:cures° parameter of these
meta templates -- which shows the ultimate source of
the information contained In the instantiated template —
2. The template and mete template structures shown In
this figure are Intended to be illustrative only: for
example, the object, date/time group, and dearbit
Information constitute embedded templates linked to
the main &amp;quot;launch&amp;quot; event template by pointers. In
addition, there are several alternatives for more
economical Internal representation of meta template
Information, which are currently under review for the
actual design and implementation of this information
within MATRES and within the Active/introspective
Information System (a knowledge-based Intelligent
assistant, as mentioned above), which MATRES
feeds.
&amp;quot;Tamuc 534°) Is NW, the news agency of the Delta
Confederation, indicating that this information came from
an MT press announcement quoted (and Interpreted) by
an Epsilon reporter. This distinguishes such Information
from that represented by the &amp;quot;assign&amp;quot; meta template,
where the Epsilon Republic reporting staff assign an
Identification number of their own to the satellite pay-
load for future reference.
Another significant analytical tool of the Epsilon reporter
In this scenario Is the comparative evaluation, Illustrated
by the &amp;quot;compare&amp;quot; meta template. These comparisons
Involve events which have taken place before, In this
case, launch events, and/or objects Involved In such
launches. As In the example shown In Figure 6, the com-
parison may specify an event Involving the continuation
of a satellite In an active status, whore other such
satellites are now Inactive (Intoned comparison): e.g.,
&amp;quot;Terns 834 la the only first generation crop enhance-
ment satellite which la currently active.&amp;quot;
An Important function of meta templates Is to represent
predictive Information: i.e., descriptions of events
expected In the future, based on other events which
have occurred In the past, or are currently In process.
The &amp;quot;expect&amp;quot; template In Figure 5 expresses the
presumable or expected parameters of mission duration,
and consequently, the dearblt event which Is anticipated
for October 26.
To summarize, the function of the meta templates Is to
identify and delimit evaluative commentary, which Iso-
lates the factual Information presented in most zeroth
order meta event reports, and Identifies Information per-
taining to credibility of the event occurrence, compara-
bility with other similar entitles and events, predictions
of future related events, etc.
On the other hand, In addition to distinguishing the vari-
ous levels of event occurrence, observation, and report-
ing, the function of the meta event structure Illustrated
In Figures 2 and 4 Is to clearly demarcate the &amp;quot;Delta
versus Epsilon&amp;quot; (In terms of the scenario described
above) aspects of the messages. The reporters of the
Epsilon Republic &amp;quot;assign&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Spacoid&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;WSJ&amp;quot; Identifi-
cation numbers for apace object Inventory purposes; the
Deltas &amp;quot;designate&amp;quot; their own space objects with partic-
ular classes of object names, e.g., &amp;quot;Torres 559&amp;quot;. They
&amp;quot;launch&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;put Into orbit&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;deorbit&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;recover&amp;quot;, etc.,
while the Epsilon reporters &amp;quot;assess&amp;quot;, determine
&amp;quot;active&amp;quot; vs. &amp;quot;Inactive&amp;quot; status, attribute satellite

A testbed system called MATRES has been constructed In Prolog to run under the UNIX operating system on the POP 11/70. MATRES Is a knowledge based system for understanding the natural language text of eventoriented massages In the domains of air activities and space/missile (S&amp;M) activities. The knowledge structures in MATRES, called &amp;quot;templates&amp;quot;, are essentially frames or scripts describing entities and events, which answer the military user&apos;s basic questions about these 1. This work has been carried out under the sponsorship of the Rome Air Development Center (RAOC), U. S. Air Force Systems Command, Gritfiss Air Farce Base, New York. as Illustrated In the simplified of an event template presented In Figure 1. The templates are hierarchically organized; lower level templates deal with objects or times, mid level with events containing objects and times, higher level with activities composed of events. The slots In the templates contain procedures which operate upon the output of the Definite Clause Grammar (DCG) to Instantiate the templates. are currently using a corpus of 125 messages in the S&amp;M domain as. a basis for developing a scenario for evaluation of the extended MATRES toistbed, as well as a testbed for a related knowledge based system, the Active/Introspective Information Sys- (described In Montgomery and Ruspini 1981, Ruspinl 1982] for which MATRES serves as a front end. The scenario involves two simulated nations, the Delta Confederation of the Atlantic States and the Epsilon Republic. Both nations have space programs, and each Is Interested In monitoring the technological progress of the other, using their own satellite and sensor resources and those of other friendly nations. The set of messages to be analyzed by MATRES are mainly reports of and satellite launches and orbital activities the Confederation, which are being and by the Epsilon Republic. The text messages used In the scenario has the structure and format of actual messages reporting on S&amp;M activities, although the lexicon is substantially different. As discussed in several previous technical reports prepared under earlier contracts with RAOC ((Kuhns and Montgomery 19731 (Silva at al 19794], [SING at al the subset of the English language which the text of intelligence messages Is based is essentially a specialized language for reporting events. Intermixed with factual statements reporting on entitles and however, is much evaluative Morepress announcements of the Confederation are included In the reports, and evaluative comments are made both about the events reported In the press the themselves. In data base from these messages, Is crucial to sort out these different levels of information. paper defines an approach to Identifying labeling these types of information so that they can be exploited In the context of MATRES and the data base systems which It serves.</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.88497956">As noted above, the subianguage of the message corpora for the air activities and S&amp;M domains is essentially a vehicle for reporting events. Kuhns and Montgomery [1973] presented a detailed methodology for classifying the various types of events described In the messages, which Is shown In Figure 2, and summarized below. Before describing the event classification, however, It Is enlightening to review briefly some example messages In understand the motivation for this rather complex model. Some messages — for example, those encountered In our previous research on the air activities domain -may report only primitive events. However, as noted above Illustrated In Figure 3, a message may In a report of a report-that is, It may Include s report of an event by some other source than the originator of the message. The &amp;quot;announcement&amp;quot; Is thus a report of a &apos;launch&amp;quot; event, which Is the basic or primitive event being reported. The &amp;quot;announcement&amp;quot; Is an event, but It Is clearly not on the same level as the primitive event. It report about the launch, a mets-event that Incidentally Introduces a new Information source of different credibility than the originator of the message. this distinction alone sufficient to account for the difference between the Initial two sentences of the example message and the third sentence, which contains an evaluation of the announcement, stating that It was characterized by &amp;quot;routine&amp;quot; wording. It Is thus an evaluative commentary on the press announcement of the launch event Since the announcement has been defined as a meta-event, the comment represents another meta-level. In fact, In reviewing additional examples of the message traffic In this scenario, It Is clear that, in order to accurately distill and represent Information contained in the text of these messages, the analytical methodology must identify and uniquely label the following types of information: Meta-events Non-meta-events Observational events Primitive events Attributive events Relational events World point events (location events) World point qualification events (location event qualifications) Non-world point events, or events involving two or more objects or locations Figure 2.

Example 384M Message. • /actual statements about events made by Epsilon Republic reporters. • degrees of belief In those statements, • evaluations of events and predictions of future *vents, • degrees of belief in those statements, • factual statements about events made by the Delta Press, • degrees of belief of the Epsilon Republic reporters In such statements, • predictions of future events in the press announcement, • evaluations of events reported and predictions made by the Epsilon Republic reporters. 3.0 ANALYTICAL METHODOLOGY This analytical methodology la based on a model of the reel world situation which underlies the scenario. Part of the model derives from the event classification schema mentioned above, and Illustrated in Figure 2, which was developed to account for the levels of content occuring In the event-oriented message discourse. In this classification, there are two major types of events, mete event, and non-meta events. Of the latter, events may be observational, or primitive. An observational event Is a direct perception of an event, which may be a visual perception (e.g., &amp;quot;observe&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;sight&amp;quot;), or In the case of a sensor, an electronic measurement of the emitted energy characterizing the event. A primitive event is thus a physical event of some kind which does not Involve an observation or perception. Primitive events be attributive or relational. event describes a situation In which a particular entity has a attribute at a certain time or during particular time Interval (other than the attribute location, which Is covered under relational events), for example: &amp;quot;Terrex 534 operates In the high density mode&amp;quot;. A relational event Involves entities which stand In an n-ary relation with each other at a certain time or during a fixed time Period. The Importance of the subclasses of world point and world point qualification events Is in defining the fine of an entity, say of a ship or submarine. Of these distinctions, the most relevant for this discussion are those Involving meta-events and nonmeta events, and of the latter, primitive versus observational events. In terms of the scenario described above, a primitive event may occur, say, a satellite launch by the Delta Confederation, as illustrated In Figura 4. This event, like any other event, involves the emission of energy. Such an emission is perceived by a sensing device of the Epsilon Republic. The device generates (down arrow) a report of the given event, In terms of the particular attributes of the event it Is designed to measure. This sensor report Is an observational event, entailing an observation of a primitive event. An SAM analyst for the Epsilon Republic accesses (up arrow) this report, which contains digitized Information generated by the sensor, Interprets this Information as a launch event, and Issues his own report about that event. His report, which is an Interpretation of the primitive event based on the observational event, Is a zeroth order meta-everrt: the common denominator of the message traffic. At the same time, the Deltas may release an internal report about the launch, which would also constitute a zeroth order meta-event. Based on that report, the Delta press agency, NYT, may Issue an announcement of the primitive event, the announcement constitutes a first-order meta-event. Republic reporter may then make an Interpretation of. that announcement. In the form of a report, which — being a report of a first-order meta-event -is therefore a second order meta-event Corrections or other changes made by Epsilon reporters to these messages constitute a third meta level of reporting event, since they may reference reports of reports of events. The model thus far accounts for the event reporting structure which underlies the Delta/Epsilon scenario, but we must also account for the reporter&apos;s comments about the event — La., his Interpretation or evaluation of the event -which can occur at any of these levels. The reporter&apos;s goal is to Identify and describe all the relevant parameters of an event (exemplified by the Wets In the template for a launch event, shown In the center of Figure 5) based on the observational report produced by the sensor and any other Information he may have (e.g., knowledge that a replacement of a nonfunctioning communications satellite Is likely within a given time frame). However, If the reporter&apos;s Information Is Incomplete or Imprecise, ha cannot exactly describe the parameters of an event, but will give his best Interpretation of the event based on what he knows. Thus he may report a launch of &amp;quot;an unidentified satellite&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;a probable television support satellite&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;a Possible CE satellite&amp;quot;. In some cases, he may have enough Information to make a comparative evaluation with launch events which have occurred In the past: &amp;quot;a new ESV&amp;quot;,</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.949556005555556">58 nation ls exemplified by the last sentence In the sample message presented above: the assignment of an Identification number to a space object. If a repartees Information Is good, i.e., complete and precise, the following type of launch report Is produced: the source Is the actual originator of the message. Thus, In the case of the &amp;quot;designate&amp;quot; meta template, the linfosource&amp;quot; of the designation information (i.e., that the particular satellite launched from that site at that date has been designated a space object called MSG. 04 -098 VARIABLE DENSITY CE AGSAT LAUNCH, 20 SEPTEMBER 1983 A VARIABLE DENSITY CROP ENHANCEMENT AGRICULTURAL SATELLITE WAS LAUNCHED PROM THE HARRISBURG MISSILE AND SPACE COMPLEX (HMSC) AT 1606Z ON 20 SEPTEMBER 1983. THE BRO2 LAUNCH SYSTEM WAS USED TO PLACE THE SATELLITE INTO A 3 DEGREE ORBIT. WSJ OBJECT NUMBER 6018 HAS BEEN ASSIGNED TO THE PAYLOAD. his Information Is Imprecise and his knowledge can add Me to It, he must resort to the qualified or meta-commented types of messages described above. In order to accommodate such qualified and metacommentary types of Information, each event template may have associated with It one or more meta templates containing Interpretive or evaluative Information. Thus, as represented In Figure 5, an Instantiated launch template produced from an observational event and a primitive event (a zeroth order reporting event, as illustrated In Figure 4) may have several additional qualifications (exemplified by, but not limited to, the meta templates Illustrated In the figure). So, for example, a meta associated with a launch template expresses the Epsilon reporter&apos;s degree of belief or confidence In the launch parameters he reports: the object in the event template Is believed by the Epsilon reporter to be a CE (or Crop Enhancement) satellite from the information presented In the observational report by the sensor, and from his own knowledge of past occurrences of CE satellite launches, as well as expectations of possible replacement launches, etc., during particular time Intervals. All or one of the listed parameters for a launch event may be qualified In this way. Thus, In Figure 5, the Epsilon reporter believes that, to the best of his knowledge, the space object Involved in the major launch event Is a &amp;quot;probable&amp;quot; CE or crap enhancement satellite, and that the time of launch Is &amp;quot;approximately&amp;quot; 11302. Each meta template has fields which Identify the source, as well as the time and date of the Interpretive informato the &amp;quot;Intel:cures° parameter of these meta templates -which shows the ultimate source of the information contained In the instantiated template — 2. The template and mete template structures shown In this figure are Intended to be illustrative only: for example, the object, date/time group, and dearbit Information constitute embedded templates linked to the main &amp;quot;launch&amp;quot; event template by pointers. In addition, there are several alternatives for more economical Internal representation of meta template Information, which are currently under review for the actual design and implementation of this information within MATRES and within the Active/introspective Information System (a knowledge-based Intelligent assistant, as mentioned above), which MATRES feeds. Is news agency of the Delta Confederation, indicating that this information came from an MT press announcement quoted (and Interpreted) by reporter. This distinguishes such Information from that represented by the &amp;quot;assign&amp;quot; meta template, where the Epsilon Republic reporting staff assign an Identification number of their own to the satellite payload for future reference. Another significant analytical tool of the Epsilon reporter In this scenario Is the comparative evaluation, Illustrated by the &amp;quot;compare&amp;quot; meta template. These comparisons Involve events which have taken place before, In this case, launch events, and/or objects Involved In such As In the example shown In Figure comparison may specify an event Involving the continuation of a satellite In an active status, whore other such are now (Intoned e.g., &amp;quot;Terns 834 la the only first generation crop enhancement satellite which la currently active.&amp;quot; An Important function of meta templates Is to represent predictive Information: i.e., descriptions of events expected In the future, based on other events which have occurred In the past, or are currently In process. The &amp;quot;expect&amp;quot; template In Figure 5 expresses the presumable or expected parameters of mission duration, and consequently, the dearblt event which Is anticipated for October 26. To summarize, the function of the meta templates Is to identify and delimit evaluative commentary, which Isolates the factual Information presented in most zeroth order meta event reports, and Identifies Information pertaining to credibility of the event occurrence, comparability with other similar entitles and events, predictions of future related events, etc. On the other hand, In addition to distinguishing the various levels of event occurrence, observation, and reporting, the function of the meta event structure Illustrated In Figures 2 and 4 Is to clearly demarcate the &amp;quot;Delta versus Epsilon&amp;quot; (In terms of the scenario described above) aspects of the messages. The reporters of the Epsilon Republic &amp;quot;assign&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Spacoid&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;WSJ&amp;quot; Identification numbers for apace object Inventory purposes; the Deltas &amp;quot;designate&amp;quot; their own space objects with particular classes of object names, e.g., &amp;quot;Torres 559&amp;quot;. They &amp;quot;launch&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;put Into orbit&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;deorbit&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;recover&amp;quot;, etc., while the Epsilon reporters &amp;quot;assess&amp;quot;, determine &amp;quot;active&amp;quot; vs. &amp;quot;Inactive&amp;quot; status, attribute satellite 59 Z . ; b ■ 3 E • 2 c*&amp;quot;ov • 1 Iri ...... • .. 00 i A • at Z 2E --• isa•s egifil.ws4u ocao 2.2.5aaeo.EE.5 • la et ; . a E 4. a 7.
