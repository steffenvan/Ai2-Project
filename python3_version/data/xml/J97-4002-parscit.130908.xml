This paper reports on an empirically based system that automatically resolves VP ellipsis in the
644 examples identified in the parsed Penn Treebank. The results reported here represent the first
systematic corpus-based study of VP ellipsis resolution, and the performance of the system is
comparable to the best existing systems for pronoun resolution. The methodology and utilities
described can be applied to other discourse-processing problems, such as other forms of ellipsis
and anaphora resolution.
The system determines potential antecedents for ellipsis by applying syntactic constraints,
and these antecedents are ranked by combining structural and discourse preference factors such
as recency, clausal relations, and parallelism. The system is evaluated by comparing its output
to the choices of human coders. The system achieves a success rate of 94.8%, where success is
defined as sharing of a head between the system choice and the coder choice, while a baseline
recency-based scheme achieves a success rate of 75.0% by this measure. Other criteria for success
are also examined. When success is defined as an exact, word-for-word match with the coder
choice, the system performs with 76.0% accuracy, and the baseline approach achieves only 14.6%
accuracy. Analysis of the individual components of the system shows that each of the structural
and discourse constraints used are strong predictors of the antecedent of VP ellipsis.

<bodyText confidence="0.999754684210526">
Ellipsis is a pervasive phenomenon in natural language, and it has been a major topic
of study in theoretical linguistics and computational linguistics in the past several
decades (Ross 1967; Sag 1976; Williams 1997; Hankamer and Sag 1976; Webber 1978;
Lappin 1984; Sag and Hankamer 1984; Chao 1987; Ristad 1990; Harper 1990; Kitagawa
1991; Dalrymple, Shieber, and Pereira 1991; Lappin 1992; Hardt 1993; Kehler 1993;
Fiengo and May 1994). While previous work provides important insight into the ab-
stract syntactic and semantic representations that underlie ellipsis phenomena, there
has been little empirically oriented work on ellipsis. The availability of parsed cor-
pora such as the Penn Treebank (Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz 1993) makes it
possible to empirically investigate elliptical phenomena in a way not possible before.
This paper reports on an empirically based system that automatically resolves
VP ellipsis in the 644 examples identified in the parsed Penn Treebank. This work
builds on structural constraints and discourse heuristics first proposed in Hardt (1992)
and further developed in Hardt (1995). The results reported here represent the first
systematic corpus-based study of VP ellipsis resolution, and the performance of the
system is comparable to the best existing systems for pronoun resolution.
The VP elipsis resolution system (VPE-RES) operates on Penn Treebank parse
trees to determine the antecedent for VPE occurrences. The system, implemented in
Common LISP, uses a Syntactic Filter to eliminate candidate antecedents in impossible

syntactic configurations, and then ranks remaining candidates using Preference Factors
involving recency, parallelism, clausal relations, and quotation structure.
All the examples of VPE in the Treebank were coded for the correct antecedent by
two coders. Also, a baseline scheme is implemented, which always selects the most
recent full VP. Both the system and the baseline are evaluated by comparison with the
coder output, with respect to three different definitions of success:

<listItem confidence="0.999835166666667">
1. Head Overlap: either the head verb of the system choice is contained in
the coder choice, or the head verb of the coder choice is contained in the

2. Head Match: the system choice and coder choice have the same head
verb.
3. Exact Match: the system choice and coder choice match word-for-word.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.991307545454545">
Using the Head Overlap measure, the system achieves a success rate of 94.8%
on a blind test of 96 Wall Street Journal examples, while the baseline recency scheme
achieves a success rate of 75.0% by this measure. Using the Exact Match measure,
the system performs with 76.0% accuracy, and the baseline approach achieves 14.6%
accuracy.
In what follows, we first present background on the data set and the coding
of that data. Next, we describe the VPE-RES system, examining the Syntactic Filter,
the Preference Factors, and the Post-Filter. There follows an empirical analysis of the
system, in which we compare the system output to coder choice, based on our three
success criteria. Also, the subparts of the system are analyzed individually, in three
different ways. Finally, we briefly discuss related work.

2.1 The Data: VPE in the Penn Treebank
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999952">
We have identified 644 examples of VPE from the Brown Corpus and the Wall Street
Journal Corpus of the Penn Treebank. Since the parsing schemes used in the Penn
Treebank do not explicitly label VPE occurrences, it is difficult to ensure that all oc-
currences of VPE in the Treebank are found. However, this data set is the first large
set of ellipsis examples we are aware of, and it provides a solid empirical foundation
not only for the current study, but for future research on ellipsis.
We used several techniques to identify ellipsis occurrences in the Treebank, all
involving the tree pattern-matching utility tgrep.1 In the Wall Street Journal Corpus,
the -NONE- category is used to represent a variety of empty expressions, including
VPE. We searched for the following pattern:

with the Penn Treebank CD-ROM.

In the Brown Corpus, VPE occurrences are not labeled in this way. We searched
for occurrences of a sentence (S) with an auxiliary (AUX) but no VP.
To evaluate our identification criteria, we performed a manual search for VPE
occurrences in a sample of files constituting about 3.2% of the Treebank.2 In this sample,
we found that the Recall was 44%, and the Precision was 53%, as depicted in Table 1.
In this sample, there were 27 valid VPE occurrences that were missed. We tested
VPE-RES on these examples, and found that its performance was comparable to its
performance on the examples that were automatically identified. The results are given
in Table 2, which also includes results on the complete corpus, for ease of comparison.&apos;

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99825925">
The Syntactic Filter rules out antecedents that improperly contain the VPE occurrence.&apos;
While the precise definition of improper containment is an active area of theoretical
research,&apos; we rule out antecedents that contain the VPE in a sentential complement. An
example of this is given in Figure 1, the parse tree for the sentence in (4).7

Here, the VPE occurrence would cannot select as its antecedent the containing VP
headed by said. This is ruled out by the Syntactic Filter, because the VPE is contained
in SBar, a sentential complement to said.
Pronoun resolution systems often incorporate a syntactic filter—a mechanism to
remove certain antecedents based on syntactic structure. The basic syntactic constraint
for pronouns is that they cannot take a &amp;quot;local&amp;quot; antecedent, as described, for example,
in Principle B of the binding theory (Chomsky, 1984&apos; The Syntactic Filter for VPE also
rules out &amp;quot;local&amp;quot; antecedents in a sense: it rules out antecedents in certain containment
configurations.
The implementation of the Syntactic Filter is complicated by two factors: first,

<footnote confidence="0.954183636363636">
5 This constraint is discussed in Hardt (1992) as a way of ruling out antecedents for VPE.
6 See, for example Sag (1976) and May (1985) for discussion, and for example Lappin and McCord (1990)
and Jacobson (1992) for alternative views.
7 Parse trees display the exact category labels and structure represented in the Penn Treebank parses. We
have added a label, VPE, for VPE occurrences. See Appendix A for a list of Penn Treebank tags; for
more information, see Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz (1993).
8 While the precise formulation of Principle B remains controversial, it is generally agreed to rule out, for
example, the binding of a pronoun in object position by an NP in subject position. Such constraints on
pronoun resolution have been incorporated into several computational approaches to pronoun
resolution, such as Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard (1987), Lappin and McCord (1990), and Lappin and
Leass (1994).

Here, the (circled) VP headed by take is the antecedent for the VPE, despite the
containment relation.
The second complication results from a basic limitation in Treebank parses; there
is no distinction between arguments and adjuncts. A VP must be ruled out if the VPE
is within a nonquantificational argument; when a VPE occurs in an adjunct position,
the &amp;quot;containing&amp;quot; VP is a permissible antecedent. The following sentence, whose parse
tree is in Figure 3, is an example of this:

<bodyText confidence="0.999958142857143">
In this case, the (circled) VP headed by get is the antecedent for the VPE, despite
the appearance of containment. Since the VPE is contained in an adjunct (an adverbial
phrase), there is in fact a nonmaximal VP headed by get that does not contain the VPE:
this is the VP get to the corner of Adams and Clark. However, because of the approach
taken in annotating the Penn Treebank, this nonmaximal VP is not displayed as a VP.
To capture the above data, the Syntactic Filter rules out VPs that contain the VPE
in a sentential complement; any other antecedent-containment relation is permitted.

9 An anonymous CL reviewer suggests that the filter may be overly restrictive, because of examples like
the following:
A: It&apos;s an important issue, and I&apos;m very concerned about it.
B: Well, frankly, I don&apos;t care that you do.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9891138">
(Italicized expressions receive pitch accents.) Here, the antecedent for the VPE is care; this would not be
permitted by the filter. The reviewer suggests that examples like this should not be categorically
excluded, although they are perhaps less than fully acceptable. If this is true, it raises interesting
theoretical issues about the acceptability of antecedent-containment configurations. However, the
reviewer notes that &amp;quot;such examples are no doubt rare and perhaps the proposed containment filter
does enough work in correctly excluding ill-formed instances of ellipsis to justify the categorical
exclusion of these cases.&amp;quot; Based on our empirical research up to this point, we concur with this. No
examples of this sort have been observed among the 644 VPE examples in the Penn Treebank, and the
Syntactic Filter as currently formulated contributes significantly to the overall performance of the
system (see Section 4 for figures on this).

<bodyText confidence="0.929968777777778">
Each candidate is initialized with a weight of 1. This weight is modified by any
applicable Preference Factors.
3.2.1 Recency. The simplest and most important factor is recency: if no other Preference
Factors obtain, the most recent (syntactically possible) antecedent is always chosen.
The weights are modified as follows: the first VP weight is set to be the recency
factor, 1.15. Moving rightward, toward the VPE, the weight of each subsequent VP
is multiplied by the recency factor. Thus, if there are three VPs preceding the VPE,
we have (1.15 1.32 1.52). If a VP contains another VP, the two VPs are set at the same
level. Finally, VPs following the VPE are penalized in a symmetrical fashion.&apos;
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9399705">
3.2.2 Clausal Relations. There is a strong preference for a VP antecedent that is in a
clausal relation to the VPE.11 Consider the following example:
(7) tells you what the characters are thinking and feeling [ADvp far more
precisely than intertitles, or even words, ivnE would}].
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999887">
The VP headed by tells is modified by the adverbial phrase (labeled ADVP) con-
taining the VPE. This VP is the correct antecedent. A VP in such a relation is given
a very high weight, by the Preference Factor Clause-Rel, which in practice makes it
an obligatory antecedent. If Clause-Rel is deactivated, the system incorrectly selects
feeling as the antecedent, because it is the most recent VP.
The modification relation can also be a comparative relation, as illustrated by the
following example, whose parse tree is given in Figure 4:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.896588">
(8) All felt freer to discuss things than students had previously.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.975350066666667">
Here, the correct antecedent is the (circled) VP headed by felt. This VP is modified
by the comparative clause containing the VPE, and thus is correctly selected by the
system. With Clause-Rel deactivated, the system incorrectly selects the more recent VP
discuss things.
Note that such VPs are parsed as containing the VPE, but they are not removed
by the Syntactic Filter. Thus, the effect of this constraint is best observed in conjunc-
tion with the Syntactic Filter. In the testing of the system, we examined each system
component separately, as described below. However, we also examined Clause-Rel in
combination with the Syntactic Filter, because of their close connection. We did this
by defining a Composite system component, consisting of Syntactic Filter, Clause-Rel,
and Post-Filter.
3.2.3 Parallelism. There is a preference for similar parallel elements, that is, the el-
ements surrounding the ellipsis site, and the elements that correspond to them sur-
rounding the antecedent. Notions of parallelism figure prominently in many theoretical
studies of ellipsis.12 However, the proposal that similarity of parallel elements can be
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.920391666666667">
10 This reflects the fact that VPE, like pronominal anaphora, permits the antecedent to follow, rather than
precede, the VPE occurrence.
11 This constraint is discussed in Hardt (1992).
12 The term parallel elements is from Dalrymple, Shieber, and Pereira (1991), where parallelism is
emphasized in the interpretation of ellipsis. Parallelism is also important in many other treatments of
ellipsis, such as Priist, Scha, and van den Berg (1991), Asher (1993), and Fiengo and May (1994).

used to guide ellipsis resolution is, to our knowledge, a new one.&apos; Our current results
involving parallelism provide support for this claim.&apos; We are continuing to experiment
with more sophisticated ways of measuring the similarity of parallel elements.
In the case of VPE, the subject and auxiliary are parallel elements. Currently, the
system only examines the form of the auxiliary. In Hardt (1992) a preference for VPE
with coreferential subjects is suggested. This information is not available in the Penn
Treebank, and we do not use any forms of subject matching in the current version of
the system.
Aux-Match (Form of Auxiliary). There is a preference for a similar base form of auxiliary
in antecedent and VPE. The categories for auxiliary forms we use are: do, be, have, can,
would, should, to. We prefer an antecedent that shares the same category of auxiliary
form as the VPE. The weights of all potential antecedents that do not match the VPE
auxiliary category are multiplied by our Standard Penalty Value, which is .667.
This preference is illustrated by the following example:
(9) Someone with a master&apos;s degree in classical arts who works in a deli
would [vi&apos; be ideal], litigation sciences hip advises]. So [vpE would]
someone recently divorced or widowed.
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.9962162">
13 The importance of similar parallel elements in discourse relations is emphasized in Hobbs (1979), and
it is applied to VPE resolution in Hobbs and Kehler (1997), in a rather different context than that of this
paper.
14 As discussed in Section 4, the Parallelism Preference Factor makes an important contribution to the
system performance.

<bodyText confidence="0.99601775">
Here, the correct antecedent is be ideal. It is selected because it has a would auxiliary,
which is the same category as the VPE. Without this constraint, the system incorrectly
selects the VP advises.
Another example is the following:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.824749333333333">
(10) In the past, customers had to [vp go to IBM when they [vp outgrew the
Vax]]. Now they don&apos;t have [NTH to].
Here, the correct antecedent is the matrix VP headed by go. It has a to auxiliary, as
does the VPE. Without this constraint, the VP outgrew the VAX is incorrectly selected
by the system.
Parallel-Match (Be-do conflict). There is an additional penalty for a VP antecedent with
a be-form auxiliary, if the VPE is a do-form.15 This is implemented by multiplying the
VP by our Standard Penalty Value of .667. Consider the following example:
(11) You [vp know what the law of averages [VP is]], don&apos;t you VPE?
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.596912142857143">
Here, neither potential antecedent matches the auxiliary category of the VPE, and
therefore both are penalized by the general auxiliary match constraint. However, the
nearer antecedent, is, is a be-form, and is thus subject to an additional penalty. This
allows the matrix antecedent, know what the law of averages is, to be correctly selected.
3.2.4 Quotation. If the VPE occurs within quoted material, there is a preference for
an antecedent that also occurs within quoted materia1.16 This is illustrated by the
following example:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.977666">
(12) &amp;quot;We [vp have good times].&amp;quot; This happy bulletin kip convulsed

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9958825">
Here, the correct antecedent is have good times. The VP convulsed Mr. Gorboduc is
penalized by the Standard Penalty Value, because it is not within quotations, while the
VPE is within quotations. Without the application of the quote preference, the system
incorrectly selects convulsed Mr. Gorboduc.

4.1 Success Criteria

<bodyText confidence="0.9877465">
To test the performance of the system, we first obtained a coded file, which indicates a
human coder&apos;s preferred antecedent for each example. Then we compared the output
of the system with the coder&apos;s selections.
As mentioned in Section 1, we define three criteria for success:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.996021166666667">
1. Head Overlap: either the head verb of the system choice is contained in
the coder choice, or the head verb of the coder choice is contained in the
system choice.
2. Head Match: the system choice and coder choice have the same head
verb.
3. Exact Match: the system choice and coder choice match word-for-word.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99972625">
To illustrate these criteria, we give three examples, one for each success criterion.
Note that the success criteria are increasingly strict—if an example satisfies Exact
Match, it will also satisfy the other two criteria, and if an example satisfies Head
Match, it will also satisfy Head Overlap.

According to Head Overlap, the system choice is correct, since its head verb, plead,
is contained in the coder selection. This would not be considered correct according to
Head Match, since the head of the coder selection is agreed.

4.2 Test Results
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999972125">
After identifying 644 examples of VPE in the Treebank, we reserved 96 randomly
selected examples from the Wall Street Journal corpus for a blind test. In Table 4, we
give results for the blind test and for the entire Penn Treebank, and we report separate
figures on the Brown Corpus and Wall Street Journal Corpus.&apos; As a baseline, we also
report results (Table 5) on a simple recency-based approach: the most recent VP is
always chosen. No Preference Factors or filters are applied.
The difference between the VPE-RES performance and the baseline is statistically
significant by all three criteria, based on a X2 analysis, p &lt; .001.

4.3 Evaluating System Subparts
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999832">
In Tables 6, 7, and 8, we present results on each major subpart of the program. For this
evaluation, we used the Exact Match criterion. We evaluated subparts in three ways:
first, we began with the baseline (recency) approach, and activated a single additional
component, to see how the system performance changed based on that component.
Second, we began with the complete system, and deactivated a single component.
Finally, we evaluated system components in an incremental fashion, beginning with
Post-Filter, then activating Syntactic Filter with Post-Filter still activated, etc. The Com-
posite Factor is a combination of Post-Filter, Syntactic Filter, and Clause-Rel.
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.96142075">
17 Since the blind test examples are all taken from the Wall Street Journal corpus, it is most appropriate to
compare the blind test results directly to the results on the Wall Street Journal Corpus. Not
surprisingly, the blind test results are slightly lower than the results on the complete Wall Street
Journal Corpus, since this contains the examples that functioned as training data.

4.4 System Components
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98748925">
The most important system component is the Composite Factor, which is a combination
of the Syntactic Filter, the Post-Filter, and Clause-Rel. The contribution of Clause-Rel is
not evident individually; if it is the only factor activated together with Recency-Only,
performance in the complete corpus actually declines from 29.2% to 28.1%. However,
this is because Clause-Rel requires the Syntactic Filter to make a contribution. This
can be observed from the fact that Composite performs better than its individual com-
ponents. Also, when Clause-Rel is the deactivated factor, performance declines from
75.9% to 72.8%. The Parallelism Preference Factors, Aux-Match and Parallel-Match,

also make an important contribution: when they are activated in the incremental anal-
ysis, there are 22 additional correct selections in the complete corpus, an improvement
of 3.4%.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997381">
4.5 Errors and Evaluation Criteria
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9985055">
Many of the errors occurring under the Exact Match criterion involve alternatives that
are virtually identical in meaning, as in the following example:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.799173666666667">
(17) Stephen Vincent Benet&apos;s John Brown&apos;s Body [yr comes immediately to
mind] [pp in this connection], as does John Steinbeck&apos;s The Grapes Of
Wrath and Carl Sandburg&apos;s The People, Yes.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9909324375">
Here, VPE-RES selected comes immediately to mind, since the PP in this connection
is parsed as a sister to the VP. One coder selected comes immediately to mind in this
connection, while the other coder made the same selection as VPE-RES. It is difficult
to see any difference in meaning between the two choices.
Because of examples like this, we believe Head Overlap or Head Match are prefer-
able criteria for success. Even with the Head Match criterion, there are errors that
involve very subtle differences, such as the following example:
(18) We were there at a moment when the situation in Laos threatened to
ignite another war among the world &apos;s giants. Even if it did not, how
would this little world of gentle people cope with its new reality of
grenades and submachine guns?
The coder selected ignite another war among the world&apos;s giants, while VPE-RES selected
threatened to ignite another war among the world&apos;s giants.
Some errors result from problems with the Syntactic Filter. The following example
illustrates a case of antecedent containment that is not recognized by the filter as
currently formulated.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.996049">
(19) All the generals who held important commands in World War 2, did not
write books. It only seems as if they did.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9950505">
The VPE-RES system incorrectly selects seems as the antecedent, because it does
not recognize that the VP headed by seems improperly contains the VPE.

There is no comparable work we are aware of dealing with VPE resolution; to our
knowledge, this is the first empirical study of a VPE resolution algorithm. There is,
however, a large body of empirically oriented work on pronoun resolution. A promi-
nent recent example is Lappin and Leass (1994), in which a pronoun resolution system
is evaluated on 360 examples taken from computer manuals, with a success rate of
86%. This work involves a post hoc evaluation of the system output, and it appears
that evaluation is based on Head Match, although this is not discussed explicitly. The
VPE-RES system achieves an 84.4% success rate according to Head Match in the Blind
Test data from the Wall Street Journal corpus. This compares favorably with Lappin
and Leass&apos;s result, especially considering that computer manual text is a good deal
more restricted than newspaper text. It is also likely that the VPE-RES success rate
would be higher using a post hoc evaluation scheme.

6. Conclusions and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999962117647059">
We have described the first empirical study of VP ellipsis resolution, using a data set of
644 examples from the Penn Treebank to develop and test a VPE resolution system. The
system performance is comparable to the best existing systems for pronoun resolution.
The Preference Factors in the system were selected and developed in an itera-
tive testing and refinement process. In future work, we will explore the relationship of
these factors to more fundamental and general features of discourse interpretation. We
suspect that the preferences for clausal relations, parallelism, and quotation structure
all involve clues to the underlying discourse structure, reflecting a general preference
for configurations where the VPE clause and antecedent clause participate in a dis-
course relation.&apos; A clausal relation is simply an explicit syntactic clue that there is a
discourse relation between two clauses, while similarity of parallel elements is another,
more indirect clue of a discourse relation, as discussed for example in Hobbs (1979)
and Hobbs and Kehler (1997).
We plan to apply the general approach to other discourse-processing problems,
such as other forms of ellipsis, and pronoun resolution. We conjecture that suitably
generalized versions of the constraints and heuristics in the current system can be
applied to a broad range of discourse-processing problems.

<abstract confidence="0.993614375">This paper reports on an empirically based system that automatically resolves VP ellipsis in the 644 examples identified in the parsed Penn Treebank. The results reported here represent the first systematic corpus-based study of VP ellipsis resolution, and the performance of the system is comparable to the best existing systems for pronoun resolution. The methodology and utilities described can be applied to other discourse-processing problems, such as other forms of ellipsis and anaphora resolution. The system determines potential antecedents for ellipsis by applying syntactic constraints, and these antecedents are ranked by combining structural and discourse preference factors such as recency, clausal relations, and parallelism. The system is evaluated by comparing its output to the choices of human coders. The system achieves a success rate of 94.8%, where success is defined as sharing of a head between the system choice and the coder choice, while a baseline recency-based scheme achieves a success rate of 75.0% by this measure. Other criteria for success are also examined. When success is defined as an exact, word-for-word match with the coder choice, the system performs with 76.0% accuracy, and the baseline approach achieves only 14.6% accuracy. Analysis of the individual components of the system shows that each of the structural and discourse constraints used are strong predictors of the antecedent of VP ellipsis.</abstract>

The VPE-RES system achieves an 84.4% success rate according to Head Match in the Blind Test data from the Wall Street Journal corpus. This compares favorably with Lappin and Leass&apos;s result, especially considering that computer manual text is a good deal more restricted than newspaper text. It is also likely that the VPE-RES success rate would be higher using a post hoc evaluation scheme. 538 Hardt VP Ellipsis Previous work on pronoun resolution (Hobbs 1978, Walker 1989) reports higher success rates.

We prefer an antecedent that shares the same category of auxiliary form as the VPE. The weights of all potential antecedents that do not match the VPE auxiliary category are multiplied by our Standard Penalty Value, which is .667. This preference is illustrated by the following example: (9) Someone with a master&apos;s degree in classical arts who works in a deli would [vi&apos; be ideal], litigation sciences hip advises]. So [vpE would] someone recently divorced or widowed. 13 The importance of similar parallel elements in discourse relations is emphasized in Hobbs (1979), and it is applied to VPE resolution in Hobbs and Kehler (1997), in a rather different context than that of this paper. 14 As discussed in Section 4, the Parallelism Preference Factor makes an important contribution to the system performance. 533 Computational Linguistics Volume 23, Number 4 Here, the correct antecedent is be ideal. It is selected because it has a would auxiliary, which is the same category as the VPE. Without this constraint, the system incorrectly selects the VP advises.

We suspect that the preferences for clausal relations, parallelism, and quotation structure all involve clues to the underlying discourse structure, reflecting a general preference for configurations where the VPE clause and antecedent clause participate in a discourse relation.&apos; A clausal relation is simply an explicit syntactic clue that there is a discourse relation between two clauses, while similarity of parallel elements is another, more indirect clue of a discourse relation, as discussed for example in Hobbs (1979) and Hobbs and Kehler (1997). We plan to apply the general approach to other discourse-processing problems, such as other forms of ellipsis, and pronoun resolution. We conjecture that suitably generalized versions of the constraints and heuristics in the current system can be applied to a broad range of discourse-processing problems.

The weights of all potential antecedents that do not match the VPE auxiliary category are multiplied by our Standard Penalty Value, which is .667. This preference is illustrated by the following example: (9) Someone with a master&apos;s degree in classical arts who works in a deli would [vi&apos; be ideal], litigation sciences hip advises]. So [vpE would] someone recently divorced or widowed. 13 The importance of similar parallel elements in discourse relations is emphasized in Hobbs (1979), and it is applied to VPE resolution in Hobbs and Kehler (1997), in a rather different context than that of this paper. 14 As discussed in Section 4, the Parallelism Preference Factor makes an important contribution to the system performance. 533 Computational Linguistics Volume 23, Number 4 Here, the correct antecedent is be ideal. It is selected because it has a would auxiliary, which is the same category as the VPE. Without this constraint, the system incorrectly selects the VP advises. Another example is the following: (10) In the past, customers had to [vp go to IBM when they [vp outgrew the Vax]]. Now they don&apos;t have [NTH to]. Here, the correct ante</context>

We suspect that the preferences for clausal relations, parallelism, and quotation structure all involve clues to the underlying discourse structure, reflecting a general preference for configurations where the VPE clause and antecedent clause participate in a discourse relation.&apos; A clausal relation is simply an explicit syntactic clue that there is a discourse relation between two clauses, while similarity of parallel elements is another, more indirect clue of a discourse relation, as discussed for example in Hobbs (1979) and Hobbs and Kehler (1997). We plan to apply the general approach to other discourse-processing problems, such as other forms of ellipsis, and pronoun resolution. We conjecture that suitably generalized versions of the constraints and heuristics in the current system can be applied to a broad range of discourse-processing problems.

Such constraints on pronoun resolution have been incorporated into several computational approaches to pronoun resolution, such as Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard (1987), Lappin and McCord (1990), and Lappin and Leass (1994). 529 Computational Linguistics Volume 23, Number 4 VB NP take NP PP SBAR-2 ZN ZN DT NN IN NP WHNP S 1 1 1 1 the pleasure from PRP WDT NP VP 1 1 it that PRP VBD S 1 1 she used NP VPE 1 I -NONE- TO 1 1 to Figure 2 Parse tree for She was getting too old to take the pleasure from it that she used to. contained in an NP argument of the containing VP, as in Figure 2, the parse tree for the following example: (5) She was getting too old to take the pleasure from it that she used to.

(19) All the generals who held important commands in World War 2, did not write books. It only seems as if they did. The VPE-RES system incorrectly selects seems as the antecedent, because it does not recognize that the VP headed by seems improperly contains the VPE. 5. Related Work There is no comparable work we are aware of dealing with VPE resolution; to our knowledge, this is the first empirical study of a VPE resolution algorithm. There is, however, a large body of empirically oriented work on pronoun resolution. A prominent recent example is Lappin and Leass (1994), in which a pronoun resolution system is evaluated on 360 examples taken from computer manuals, with a success rate of 86%. This work involves a post hoc evaluation of the system output, and it appears that evaluation is based on Head Match, although this is not discussed explicitly. The VPE-RES system achieves an 84.4% success rate according to Head Match in the Blind Test data from the Wall Street Journal corpus. This compares favorably with Lappin and Leass&apos;s result, especially considering that computer manual text is a good deal more restricted than newspaper text. It is also likely that </context>

While previous work provides important insight into the abstract syntactic and semantic representations that underlie ellipsis phenomena, there has been little empirically oriented work on ellipsis. The availability of parsed corpora such as the Penn Treebank (Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz 1993) makes it possible to empirically investigate elliptical p</context>

The basic syntactic constraint for pronouns is that they cannot take a &amp;quot;local&amp;quot; antecedent, as described, for example, in Principle B of the binding theory (Chomsky, 1984&apos; The Syntactic Filter for VPE also rules out &amp;quot;local&amp;quot; antecedents in a sense: it rules out antecedents in certain containment configurations. The implementation of the Syntactic Filter is complicated by two factors: first, there are certain cases in which a containing antecedent is possible, where the VPE is 5 This constraint is discussed in Hardt (1992) as a way of ruling out antecedents for VPE. 6 See, for example Sag (1976) and May (1985) for discussion, and for example Lappin and McCord (1990) and Jacobson (1992) for alternative views. 7 Parse trees display the exact category labels and structure represented in the Penn Treebank parses. We have added a label, VPE, for VPE occurrences. See Appendix A for a list of Penn Treebank tags; for more information, see Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz (1993). 8 While the precise formulation of Principle B remains controversial, it is generally agreed to rule out, for example, the binding of a pronoun in object position by an NP in subject position.

The VPE-RES system achieves an 84.4% success rate according to Head Match in the Blind Test data from the Wall Street Journal corpus. This compares favorably with Lappin and Leass&apos;s result, especially considering that computer manual text is a good deal more restricted than newspaper text. It is also likely that the VPE-RES success rate would be higher using a post hoc evaluation scheme. 538 Hardt VP Ellipsis Previous work on pronoun resolution (Hobbs 1978, Walker 1989) reports higher success rates. However, these involved hand-tested algorithms on rather small data sets. Lappin and Leass (1994) implemented and tested Hobbs&apos;s algorithm, and reported results that were about 4% less than that of Lappin and Leass (1994). 6. Conclusions and Future Work We have described the first empirical study of VP ellipsis resolution, using a data set of 644 examples from the Penn Treebank to develop and test a VPE resolution system. The system performance is comparable to the best existing systems for pronoun resolution. The Preference Factors in the system were selected an</context>
