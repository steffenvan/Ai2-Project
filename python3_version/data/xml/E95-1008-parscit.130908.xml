Statistical language models are useful
because they can provide probabilis-
tic information upon uncertain decision
making. The most common statistic is
n-grams measuring word cooccurrences
in texts. The method suffers from data
shortage problem, however. In this pa-
per, we suggest Bayesian networks be
used in approximating the statistics of
insufficient occurrences and of those that
do not occur in the sample texts with
graceful degradation. Collocation map
is a sigmoid belief network that can be
constructed from bigrams. We compared
the conditional probabilities and mutual
information computed from bigrams and
Collocation map. The results show that
the variance of the values from Colloca-
tion map is smaller than that from fre-
quency measure for the infrequent pairs
by 48%. The predictive power of Col-
location map for arbitrary associations
not observed from sample texts is also
demonstrated.

In statistical language processing, n-grams are ba-
sic to many probabilistic models including Hidden
Markov models that work on the limited depen-
dency of linguistic events. In this regard, Bayesian
models (Bayesian network, Belief network, Infer-
ence diagram to name a few) are not very different
from HMMs. Bayesian models capture the con-
ditional independence among probabilistic vari-
ables, and can compute the conditional distribu-
tion of the variables, which is known as a prob-
abilistic inferencing. The pure n-gram statistic,
however, is somewhat crude in that it cannot do
anything about unobserved events and its approx-
imation on infrequent events can be unreliable.
In this paper we show by way of extensive ex-
periments that the Bayesian method that also can
be composed from bigrams can overcome the data
sparseness problem that is inherent in frequency
counting methods. According to the empirical re-
sults, Collocation map that is a Bayesian model
for lexical variables induced graceful approxima-
tion over unobserved and infrequent events.
There are two known methods to deal with the
data sparseness problem. They are smoothing and
class based methods (Dagan 1992). Smoothing
methods (Church and Gale 1991) readjust the dis-
tribution of frequencies of word occurrences ob-
tained from sample texts, and verify the distri-
bution through held-out texts. As Dagan (1992)
pointed out, however, the values from the smooth-
ing methods closely agree with the probability of
a bigram consisting of two independent words.
Class based methods (Pereira et al. 1993)
approximate the likelihood of unobserved words
based on similar words. Dagan and et al. (1992)
proposed a non-hierarchical class based method.
The two approaches report limited successes of
purely experimental nature. This is so because
they are based on strong assumptions. In the case
of smoothing methods, frequency readjustment is
somewhat arbitrary and will not be good for heav-
ily dependent bigrams. As to the class based
methods, the notion of similar words differs across
different methods, and the association of proba-
bilistic dependency with the similarity (class) of
words is too strong to assume in general.
Collocation map that is first suggested in (Han
1993) is a sigmoid belief network with words as
probabilistic variables. Sigmoid belief network is
extensively studied by Neal (1992), and has an effi-
cient inferencing algorithm. Unlike other Bayesian
models, the inferencing on sigmoid belief network
is not NP-hard, and inference methods by reduc-
ing the network and sampling are discussed in
(Han 1995). Bayesian models constructed from
local dependencies provide formal approximation
among the variables, thus using Collocation map
does not require strong assumption or intuition to
justify the associations among words produced by
the map.
The results of inferencing on Collocation map
are probabilities among any combinations of
words represented in the map, which is not found

in other models. One significant shortcoming of
Bayesian models lies in the heavy cost of inferenc-
ing. Our implementation of Collocation map in-
cludes 988 nodes, and takes 2 to 3 minutes to com-
pute an association between words. The purpose
of experiments is to find out how gracefully Col-
location map deals with the unobserved cooccur-
rences in comparison with a naive bigram statistic.
In the next section, Collocation map is reviewed
following the definition in (Han 1993). In section
3, mutual information and conditional probabili-
ties computed using bigrams and Collocation map
are compared. Section 4 concludes the paper by
summarizing the good and bad points of the Col-
location map and other methods.

In this section, we make a brief introduction on
Collocation map, and refer to (Han 1993) for more
discussion on the definition and to (Han 1995) on
inference methods.
Bayesian model consists of a network and prob-
ability tables defined on the nodes of the network.
The nodes in the network represent probabilis-
tic variables of a problem domain. The network
can compute probabilistic dependency between
any combination of the variables. The model is
well documented as subjective probability theory
(Pearl 1988).
Collocation map is an application model of sig-
moid belief network (Neal 1992) that belongs to
belief networks which in turn is a type of Bayesian
model. Unlike belief networks, Collocation map
does not have deterministic variables thus consists
only of probabilistic variables that correspond to
words in this case.
Sigmoid belief network is different from other
belief networks in that it does not have probabil-
ity distribution table at each node but weights on
the edges between the nodes. A node takes binary
outcomes (1, -1) and the probability that a node
takes an outcome given the vector of outcomes of
its preceding nodes is a sigmoid function of the
outcomes and the weights of associated edges. In
this regard, the sigmoid belief network resembles
artificial neural network. Such probabilities used
to be stored at nodes in ordinary Bayesian mod-
els, and this makes the inferencing very difficult
because the probability table can be very big. Sig-
moid belief network does away with the NP-hard
complexity by avoiding the tables at the loss of
expressive generality of probability distributions
that can be encoded in the tables.
One who works with Collocation map has to
deal with two problems. The first is how to con-
struct the network, and the other is how to com-
pute the probabilities on the network.
Network can be constructed directly from a set
of bigrams obtained from a training sample. Be-
cause Collocation map is a directed acyclic graph,

cycles are avoided by making additional node of a
word when facing cycle due to the node. No more
than two nodes for each word are needed to avoid
the cycle in any case (Han 1993). Once the net-
work is setup, edges of the network are assigned
with weights that are normalized frequency of the
edges at a node.
The inferencing on Collocation map is not dif-
ferent from that for sigmoid belief network. The
time complexity of inferencing by reducing graph
on sigmoid belief networks is 0(N3) given N
nodes (Han 1995). It turned out that inferencing
on networks containing more than a few hundred
nodes was not practical using either node reduc-
tion method or sampling method, thus we adopted
the hybrid inferencing method that first reduces
the network and applies Gibbs sampling method
(Han 1995). Using the hybrid inferencing method,
computation of conditional probabilities took less
than a second for a network with 50 nodes, two
seconds for a network with 100 nodes, about nine
seconds for a network with 200 nodes, and about
two minutes for a network with about 1000 nodes.
Conditional and marginal probabilities can be
approximated from Gibb&apos;s sampling. Some con-
ditional probabilities computed from a small net-
work are shown in figure 1. Though the network
may not be big enough to model the domain of fi-
nance, the resulting values from the small network
composed of 9 dependencies seem useful and intu-
itive.

3 Experiments

<bodyText confidence="0.995124157894737">
The goal of our experiment is first to find how data
sparseness is related with the frequency based
statistics and to show Collocation map based
method gives more reliable approximations. In
particular, from the experiments we observed the
variances of statistics might suggest the level of
data sparseness. The less frequent data tended to
have higher variances though the values of statis-
tics (mutual information for instance) did not dis-
tinguish the level of occurrences. The predictive
account of Collocation map is demonstrated by
observing the variances of approximations on the
infrequent events.
The tagged Wall Street Journal articles of Penn
Tree corpus were used that contain about 2.6 mil-
lion word units. In the experiments, about 1.2
million of them was used. Programs were coded
in C language, and run on a Sun Sparc 10 work-
station.
For the first 1.2 million words, the bigrams con-
sisting of four types of categories (NN, NNS, IN,
JJ) were obtained, and mutual information of each
bigram (order insensitive) was computed. The bi-
grams were classified into 200 sets according to
their occurrences. Figure 2 summarizes the the
average MI value and the variance of each fre-
quency range. From figure 3 that shows the oc-
currence distribution of 378,888 unique bigrams,
about 70% of them occur only one time. One in-
teresting and important observation is that those
of 1 to 3 frequency range that take about 90% of
the population have very high MI values. This re-
sults also agree with Dunning&apos;s argument about
overestimation on the infrequent occurrences in
which many infrequent pairs tend to get higher
estimation (Dunning 1993). The problem is due
to the assumption of normality in naive frequency
based statistics according to Dunning (1993). Ap-
proximated values, thus, do not indicate the level
of data quality. Figure 3 shows variances can sug-
gest the level of data sufficiency. From this obser-
vation we propose the following definition on the
notion of data sparseness.
A set of units belonging to a sample of
ordered word units (texts) is a data-
sparse
if and only if the variance of measurements
on the set is greater than a.
The definition sets the concept of sparseness
within the context of a focused set of linguistic
units. For a set of units unoberved from a sam-
ple, the given sample text is for sure data-sparse.
The above definition then gives a way to judge
with respect to observed units. The measurement
of data sparseness can be a good issue to study
where it may depend on the contexts of research.
Here we suggest a simple method perhaps for the
first time in the literature.
Figure 4 compares the results from using Col-
location map and simple frequency statistic. The
variances are smaller and the pairs in frequency
1 class have non zero approximations. Because
computation on Collocation map is very high, we
have chosen 2000 unique pairs at random. The
network consists of 988 nodes. Computing an ap-
proximation (inferencing) took about 3 minutes.
The test size of 2000 pairs may not be sufficient,
but it showed the consistent tendency of grace-
ful degradation of variances. The overestimation
problem was not significant in the approximations
by Collocation map. The average value of zero fre-
quency class to which 50 unobserved pairs belong
was also on the line of smooth degradation, and
figure 4 shows only the variance.
Table 1 summarizes the details of performance
gain by using Collocation map.

4 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999851129032258">
Corpus based natural language processing has
been one of the central subjects gaining rapid at-
tention from the research community. The ma-
jor virtue of statistical approaches is in evaluating
linguistic events and determining the relative im-
portance of the events to resolve ambiguities. The
evaluation on the events (mostly cooccurrences) in
many cases, however, has been unreliable because
of the lack of data.
Data sparseness addresses the shortage of data
in estimating probabilistic parameters. As a re-
sult, there are too many events unobserved, and
even if events have been found, the occurrence is
not sufficient enough for the estimation to be re-
liable.
In contrast with existing methods that are
based on strong assumptions, the method using
Collocation map promises a logical approximation
since it is built on a thorough formal argument of
Bayesian probability theory. The powerful feature
of the framework is the ability to make use of the
conditional independence among word units and
to make associations about unseen cooccurrences
based on observed ones. This naturally induces
the attributes required to deal with data sparse-
ness. Our experiments confirm that Collocation
map makes predictive approximation and avoids
overestimation of infrequent occurrences.
One critical drawback of Collocation map is the
time complexity, but it can be useful for applica-
tions of limited scope.

Bayesian model consists of a network and probability tables defined on the nodes of the network. The nodes in the network represent probabilistic variables of a problem domain. The network can compute probabilistic dependency between any combination of the variables. The model is well documented as subjective probability theory (Pearl 1988). Collocation map is an application model of sigmoid belief network (Neal 1992) that belongs to belief networks which in turn is a type of Bayesian model.

There are two known methods to deal with the data sparseness problem. They are smoothing and class based methods (Dagan 1992). Smoothing methods (Church and Gale 1991) readjust the distribution of frequencies of word occurrences obtained from sample texts, and verify the distribution through held-out texts. As Dagan (1992) pointed out, however, the values from the smoothing methods closely agree with the probability of a bigram consisting of two independent words. Class based methods (Pereira et al. 1993) approximate the likelihood of unobserved words based on similar words. Dagan and et al. (1992) proposed a non-hierarchical class based method. The two approaches report limited successes of purely experimental nature. This is so because they are based on strong assumptions. In the case of smoothing methods, frequency readjustment is somewhat arbitrary and will not be good for heavily dependent bigrams. As to the class based methods, the notion of similar words differs across different methods, and the association of probabilistic dependency with the similarity (class) of words is too strong t</context>
