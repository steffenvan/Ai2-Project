This paper introduces a preliminary
work on Hindi causative verbs: their
classification, a linguistic model for
their classification and their verb
frames. The main objective of this work
is to come up with a classification of the
Hindi causative verbs. In the classifica-
tion we show how different types of
Hindi verbs have different types of
causative forms. It will be a linguistic
resource for Hindi causative verbs
which can be used in various NLP ap-
plications. This resource enriches the al-
ready available linguistic resource on
Hindi verb frames (Begum et al.,
2008b). This resource will be helpful in
getting proper insight into Hindi verbs.
In this paper, we present the morpholo-
gy, semantics and syntax of the causa-
tive verbs. The morphology is captured
by the word generation process; seman-
tics is captured by the linguistic model
followed for classifying the verbs and
the syntax has been captured by the verb
frames using relations given by Panini.

<bodyText confidence="0.999449222222222">
Verbs play a major role in expressing the mean-
ing of a sentence and its syntactic behavior.
They decide the number of participants that will
participate in the action. Semantically verbs are
classified into action verbs, state verbs and
process verbs. Syntactically they are classified
into intransitives, transitives and ditransitives.
The morphological, semantic and syntactic
properties of verbs play an important role in
deeper level analysis such as parsing.
Causative verbs are differently realized in dif-
ferent languages. These verbs have been an in-
teresting area of study. The study of causative
constructions is important as it involves the in-
teraction of various components such as seman-
tics, syntax and morphology (Comrie, 1981).
This paper presents the preliminary work on
Hindi causative verbs.

2 Causative Verbs
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997646833333333">
Causative verbs mean that some actor makes
somebody else do something or causes him to be
in a certain state (Agnihotri, 2007). The causal
verb indicates the causing of another to do
something, instead of doing it oneself (Greaves,
1983). Semantically causative verbs refer to a
causative situation which has two components:
(a) the causing situation or the antecedent; (b)
the caused situation or the consequent. These
two combine to make a causative situation (Ne-
dyalkov and Silnitsky, 1973). There are differ-
ent ways in which causation is indicated in dif-
ferent languages. There are three types of causa-
tives: Morphological causatives, Periphrastic
causatives and Lexical causatives (Comrie,
1981).
Morphological Causatives indicate causa-
tion with the help of verbal affixes. Sanskrit,
Hindi/Urdu, Persian, Arabic, Hebrew, Japanese,
Khmer and Finnish languages have morpholog-
ical causatives. Periphrastic causatives indi-
cate causation with the help of a verb which
occurs along with the main verb. For example,
in English in a sentence such as:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.908735">
(1) John made the child drink milk.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999863333333333">
In the above example the verb make is ex-
pressing causation which is occurring along
with the verb drink which in turn is expressing

the main action. English, German and French
are some of the languages which have periph-
rastic causatives. Lexical causatives are those
in which there is no morphological similarity
between the base verb root and the causative
verb form. A different lexical item is used to
indicate causation. For example, the causative
of English eat is feed. English and Japanese
have lexical causatives. English has both pe-
riphrastic and lexical causatives.

3 Causative verbs in Hindi

<bodyText confidence="0.993988">
Causatives in Hindi are realized through a mor-
phological process. In Hindi, a base verb root
changes to a causative verb when affixed by
either an ‘-aa’ or a ‘-vaa’ suffix.

In each step of causative derivation there is
an increase in the valency of the verb (Kachru,
2006; Comrie, 1981)

Hindi verbs are divided into two groups
based on their behaviour in causative sentences:
affective verbs and effective verbs (Kachru,
2006). The action of affective verbs benefits or
affects the agent. Affective verbs will have both
first and second causal forms. Verbs such as
ronaa ‘to cry’ and dau.Dnaa ‘to run’ are affec-
tive intransitive verbs. Only verbs belonging to
khaanaa ‘to eat’ class come under affective
transitive verbs. The agent of the affective in-
transitive verb becomes the patient and the
agent of the affective transitive verbs becomes
the recipient in the first causal and they both
will take a ko postpositon (Hindi case marker).
Effective verbs and ditransitive verbs have only
one causal form. The agent of the effective verb
and ditransitive verb becomes the causative
agent in the first causal. So this causative agent
in the first causal takes a se ‘with’ postposition
(Hindi case marker). Verbs belonging to karnaa
‘to do’ class come under the effective verbs.
The major studies in Hindi causatives: Kach-
ru (1966), Kachru (1980), Kachru (2006),
McGregor (1995), Greaves (1983), Kellogg
(1972), Agnihotri (2007), Sahaay (2004), Sa-
haay (2007), Singh (1997) and Tripathi (1986).
Kachru (1966) has given the classification of
Hindi verbs based on their causativization beha-
vior. The others have mostly talked about the
derivation process of the causative verbs.
However the classification of causative verbs
in Hindi remains an issue of discussion. Since
they are morphologically related, the decision of
what is the base verb form of these verbs re-
mains a point of discussion. There are two ap-
proaches which are followed in deciding the
base verb: (1) causative formation based only
on morphology, (2) causative formation based
on morphology and semantics.

In I, khul ‘open’ is taken as the base verb and

respectively to the base verb (Kachru, 1966;
Kachru, 1980). The arrow denotes the direction
of derivation from base verb. Here, the forward

hand, in II, khol ‘open’ is taken as the base verb.
Here, other than morphology, the semantics of
the verbs is also taken into consideration. Here
khul ‘open’ and khulvaa ‘cause to open’ are de-
rived from the base verb khol ‘open’. khulvaa
‘cause to open’ is a causative verb which is de-
rived from the base verb by adding suffix ‘-vaa’
to it. khul ‘open’ is a derived intransitive form.
The agent of the base verb khol ‘open’ is not
realized on the surface level of the derived in-
transitive verb khul ‘open’ though it is implied
semantically. Here there is both forward and
backward derivation. From base verb to the de-
rived intransitive it is a backward derivation
which means there is a reduction of one argu-
ment from base verb to the derived intransitive
verb (Tripathi, 1986; Reinhart, 2005).
In this paper, we motivate our work by pre-
senting our approach for classifying the causa-
tive verbs in Hindi.

4 Our Approach
</sectionHeader>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.968639">
4.1 Linguistic Model for Classifying Caus-
ative verbs
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99993972">
We have followed Paninian Grammatical
framework in this model as the theoretical basis
for our approach. The meaning of every verbal
root (dhaatu) consists of: (a) activity (vyaapaa-
ra) and; (b) result (phala). Activity denotes the
actions carried out by the various participants
(karakas) involved in the action. Result denotes
the state that is reached, when the action is
completed (Bharati et al., 1995). The partici-
pants of the action expressed by the verb root
are called karakas. There are six basic karakas,
namely; adhikarana ‘location’, apaadaan
‘source’, sampradaan ‘recipient’, karana ‘in-
strument’, karma ‘theme’ and karta ‘agent’
(Begum et al., 2008a). Here the mapping be-
tween karakas and theta roles is a rough map-
ping.
The karta karaka is the locus of the activity.
Similarly karma karaka is the locus of the re-
sult. The locus of the activity implied by the
verbal root can be animate or inanimate. Sen-
tence (2) given above, is the example where the
locus of the activity is animate. Sentence (5)
given below, is the example where the locus of
the activity is inanimate.

I Erg. ram by door
khulvaayaa
open.Caus.Pst
‘I made Ram open the door.’
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.999656571428572">
When we come to the causatives, the notion
of prayojak karta ‘causer’, prayojya karta
‘causee’ and madhyastha karta ‘mediator
causer’ are introduced. prayojak karta ‘causer’
is the initiator of the action. prayojya karta
‘causee’ is the one who is made to do the action
by the prayojak karta ‘causer’. madhyasta karta
‘mediator causer’ is the causative agent of the
action. The karta of the base verb becomes the
prayojya karta of the causative verb and the
prayojak karta of the first causative becomes
the madhyasta karta of the second causative.
This model takes both semantics and
morphology into consideration.

<bodyText confidence="0.99989975">
In (8), caabii ‘key’ is the karta of the transi-
tive verb khol ‘open’. caabii ‘key’ is an inani-
mate karta so this sentence can’t be causati-
vized. (8) has been tried to causativize in (9)
which is unacceptable. (9) is actually interpreted
as (10) where an inanimate noun with a se
‘with’ postposition acts as an instrument and not
as a prayojya karta ‘causee’. So in (10), caabii
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.988714">
122

<bodyText confidence="0.999621744186047">
‘key’ is an inanimate noun and takes se ‘with’
postposition so caabii se ‘with the key’ acts as
instrument and mohan ‘Mohan’ acts as the
prayojya karta ‘causee’ (Kachru, 1966). It
seems that only those verbs can be causativized
which take an animate karta.
Out of the above two given approaches, we
are following approach II where both morphol-
ogy and semantics are considered. In our ap-
proach we are saying that only those base verbs
can be causativized which take an animate karta
and it should also have volitionality (Tripathi,
1986; Reinhart, 2005). Those base verbs which
take an inanimate karta can’t be causativized.
So in our approach the prayojya karta ‘causee’
in the causative sentence is always animate as
the karta of the base verb becomes the prayojya
karta ‘causee’ in the causative sentences. In our
approach we have the notion of karmakartri
which says an intransitive can be derived out of
a basic transitive verb and the karma of the ba-
sic transitive verb becomes the karta of the de-
rived intransitive verb. So the karta of the de-
rived intransitive verb is called karmakartri.
The derived intransitive verbs are like unaccusa-
tive verbs of English.
Whereas in approach I, the intransitive base
verbs that take both animate and inanimate kar-
ta can be causativized. But in case of transitives,
base verbs which take only animate karta can be
causativized. Ditransitives can also be causati-
vized. (Kachru 1966; Kachru 1980)
We follow the dependency tagging scheme
proposed by Begum et al. (2008a) for the devel-
opment of a dependency annotation for Indian
Languages. In this scheme prayojak karta
‘causer’, prayojya karta ‘causee’ and madhyas-
tha karta ‘mediator causer’ are represented as
pk1, jk1 and mk1 respectively.
Some of the base verb forms and their causa-
tive sentences are given below with dependency
relations marked in the brackets for the appro-
priate arguments:

In this section we have given the derivation
process of the Hindi causative verbs. We have
studied 160 Hindi verbs and have come up with
certain number of rules for the derivation
process of causative verbs.
When causative affixes are added to the base
verb roots then some of the base verb roots
change in form and some don’t. Various causal
affixes are added to each verb type to form
causatives. An example of affix addition for
each verb type is discussed below. The affixes
that are added are given in bold. The changes in
the base verb root are underlined and made bold
in both root form and the causal form.

In the implementation of the causative verbs,
the causative feature of a verb is reflected in the
morph analysis. There are two possible ways to
implement causative information: (i) All the
causative verb roots are included in the root dic-
tionary of the morph analyzer with an additional
feature marking it a causative verb type. (ii) For
all causative verbs the following information is
marked; causative root, base root, verb type and
causative suffix. In (i), the information of base
verb root from which the causative root is de-
rived is missing which is captured in (ii). In the
above mentioned two ways the latter gives more
detailed information than the former.

4.2 Methodology of the Work
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999844">
For this work, 160 base verbs were taken, their
causative forms were given and were classified.
Rules for deriving causative verb forms from
their base forms were made. Verb frames for
base verbs and their causative forms were de-
veloped. Based on the analysis of the base verbs
certain problem cases were logged and generali-
zations regarding causativization were made. In
this paper, we briefly discuss about all the
points mentioned above.

4.3 Classification of Hindi Causative
Verbs

Here Hindi verbs have been classified into 6
types based on their causativization behavior:

<listItem confidence="0.46474">
➢ Type-1: Basic Intransitive verb
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9992904">
Basic intransitive verb has two causal forms
i.e., first causal and second causal form. First
causal of the basic intransitive verb functions as
a transitive verb. The subject of the basic intran-
sitive verb becomes the object of the transitive
verb or the first causal form. The subject of the
first causal form becomes the causative agent of
the second causal form. Sentence (2) is the ex-
ample of basic intransitive and sentences (3)
and (4) are its causative forms.

<listItem confidence="0.825361333333333">
➢ Type-2: Basic Transitive verb type-I (which
is similar to khaanaa ‘to eat’ verb type giv-

➢ Type-3: Basic Transitive verb type-II
(which is similar to karnaa ‘to eat’ verb
type given by Kachru (1966))
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.978522285714286">
Type-2 and type-3 are transitive verbs which
are divided into two types based on their causa-
tivization behavior. Basic transitive verbs of
type-I, like khaanaa ‘to eat’ have two causal
forms. First causal of khaanaa ‘to eat’ type verb
dhu-l dho
‘be washed’ ‘cause to wash’

also functions as ditransitive. Whereas transitive
verbs of type-II, like karnaa ‘to do’ have one
causal form. First causal of karnaa ‘to eat’ type
verb functions as causative. Sentences (11-13)
are examples for type-2 verb. Sentences (14-15)
are examples for type-3 verb.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.83436">
➢ Type-4: Basic Ditransitive verb
Ditransitive verbs also have one causal form.
Sentences (16-17) are examples for type-4 verb.

which takes a dative subject,
➢ Type-6: Basic Transitive verb type-II, out

<bodyText confidence="0.988376307692308">
of which intransitive verbs can be derived.
Type-5 and type-6 are transitive verbs which
have causal forms depending on whether it is
type-I (khaanaa ‘to eat’) transitive or type-II
(karnaa ‘to do’) transitive and in addition both
have a derived intransitive form. Type-5 takes a
dative subject in the base form. Sentences (18-
21) are examples for type-5 verb. Sentences (5-

In this section we list out the syntactic frames
for all the causative types discussed in the pre-
vious sections. Verb frame (Begum et al.,

Here the structure of a verb frame is given in
terms of dependency relation, postposition

past tense (yaa is the past tense marker) in the
TAM. Refer the examples given above for each

6 Issues and Observations
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.90999675">
There are some verbs which can’t be causati-
vized. Motion verbs like aa ‘come’ and jaa ‘go’
can’ t be causativized. After analysing certain
amount of corpus we have observed that not all
motion verbs behave like the above verbs . aa-
naa ‘to come’ and jaanaa ‘to go’ verbs can&apos;t be
causativized because these verbs always occur
as main verbs and take the following verbs as
manner adverbs: chalnaa, bhaagnaa, daudnaa.
For instance, chalkar aayaa ‘came running’ and
daudkar gayaa ‘went running’. Those motion
verbs which occur as manner adverbs and modi-
fy another motion verb can be causativized and
those verbs which occur as main verbs and nev-
er occur as manner adverbs of another motion
verb can&apos;t be causativized. Natural process verbs
like khil ‘blossom’, garajnaa ‘thunder’ and ug
‘rise’ also can’t be causativized.
There are three types of the verb nikal
‘leave’. All the three are used as intransitives.
➢ derived intransitive: sense 4 drain out
(22) paanii kamre se nikal gayaa
water room from leave go.Pst.
‘Water drained out of the room.’
➢ Baisc Intransitive: sense 4 walked out
(23) raam kamre se baahar nikal gayaa
ram room from out leave go.Pst.
‘Ram walked out of the room.’
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.336598333333333">
➢ Baisc Intransitive which involves natural
process.

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.857432833333333">
ganga gangotri from emerge.Impf.
hai
be.Pres.
‘Ganga emerges from Gangotri.’
The first type is a derived intransitive which
is derived from the base transitive verb nikaal
‘remove’. This base transitive verb root can be
causativized. The second type is basic intransi-
tive which can also be causativized. The third
type which is natural process can’t be causati-
vized. This shows how important the property
of animacy for making causatives is.

In this work we flesh out the linguistic devices
that work for causativization. In this paper we
have introduced a preliminary work on Hindi
causative verbs. We have given the classifica-
tion of causative verbs and the linguistic model
followed for their classification. We have also
given the verb frames of the causative verbs.
These insights have been incorporated in the
Hindi dependency treebank (Bhatt et al., 2009).
We also plan to use the verb frames in a Hindi
dependency parser (Bharati et al., 2009) to im-
prove its performance.

Causative verbs are differently realized in different languages. These verbs have been an interesting area of study. The study of causative constructions is important as it involves the interaction of various components such as semantics, syntax and morphology (Comrie, 1981). This paper presents the preliminary work on Hindi causative verbs. 2 Causative Verbs Causative verbs mean that some actor makes somebody else do something or causes him to be in a certain state (Agnihotri, 2007). The causal verb indicates the causing of another to do something, instead of doing it oneself (Greaves, 1983). Semantically causative verbs refer to a causative situation which has two components: (a) the causing situation or the antecedent; (b) the caused situation or the consequent. These two combine to make a causative situation (Nedyalkov and Silnitsky, 1973). There are different ways in which causation is indicated in different languages. There are three types of causatives: Morphological causatives, Periphrastic causatives and Lexical causatives (Comrie, 1981). Morphological Causatives</context>

Effective verbs and ditransitive verbs have only one causal form. The agent of the effective verb and ditransitive verb becomes the causative agent in the first causal. So this causative agent in the first causal takes a se ‘with’ postposition (Hindi case marker). Verbs belonging to karnaa ‘to do’ class come under the effective verbs. The major studies in Hindi causatives: Kachru (1966), Kachru (1980), Kachru (2006), McGregor (1995), Greaves (1983), Kellogg (1972), Agnihotri (2007), Sahaay (2004), Sahaay (2007), Singh (1997) and Tripathi (1986). Kachru (1966) has given the classification of Hindi verbs based on their causativization behavior. The others have mostly talked about the derivation process of the causative verbs. However the classification of causative verbs in Hindi remains an issue of discussion. Since they are morphologically related, the decision of what is the base verb form of these verbs remains a point of discussion. There are two approaches which are followed in deciding the base verb: (1) causative formation based only on morphology, (2) causative f</context>

There are six basic karakas, namely; adhikarana ‘location’, apaadaan ‘source’, sampradaan ‘recipient’, karana ‘instrument’, karma ‘theme’ and karta ‘agent’ (Begum et al., 2008a). Here the mapping between karakas and theta roles is a rough mapping. The karta karaka is the locus of the activity. Similarly karma karaka is the locus of the result. The locus of the activity implied by the verbal root can be animate or inanimate. Sentence (2) given above, is the example where the locus of the activity is animate. Sentenc</context>

Semantically verbs are classified into action verbs, state verbs and process verbs. Syntactically they are classified into intransitives, transitives and ditransitives. The morphological, semantic and syntactic properties of verbs play an important role in deeper level analysis such as parsing. Causative verbs are differently realized in different languages. These verbs have been an interesting area of study. The study of causative constructions is important as it involves the interaction of various components such as semantics, syntax and morphology (Comrie, 1981). This paper presents the preliminary work on Hindi causative verbs. 2 Causative Verbs Causative verbs mean that some actor makes somebody else do something or causes him to be in a certain state (Agnihotri, 2007). The causal verb indicates the causing of another to do something, instead of doing it oneself (Greaves, 1983). Semantically causative verbs refer to a causative situation which has two components: (a) the causing situation or the antecedent; (b) the caused situation or the consequent.

(8) has been tried to causativize in (9) which is unacceptable. (9) is actually interpreted as (10) where an inanimate noun with a se ‘with’ postposition acts as an instrument and not as a prayojya karta ‘causee’. So in (10), caabii 122 ‘key’ is an inanimate noun and takes se ‘with’ postposition so caabii se ‘with the key’ acts as instrument and mohan ‘Mohan’ acts as the prayojya karta ‘causee’ (Kachru, 1966). It seems that only those verbs can be causativized which take an animate karta. Out of the above two given approaches, we are following approach II where both morphology and semantics are considered. In our approach we are saying that only those base verbs can be causativized which take an animate karta and it should also have volitionality (Tripathi, 1986; Reinhart, 2005). Those base verbs which take an inanimate karta can’t be causativized. So in our approach the prayojya karta ‘causee’ in the causative sentence is always animate as the karta of the base verb becomes the prayojya karta ‘ca</context>

So the karta of the derived intransitive verb is called karmakartri. The derived intransitive verbs are like unaccusative verbs of English. Whereas in approach I, the intransitive base verbs that take both animate and inanimate karta can be causativized. But in case of transitives, base verbs which take only animate karta can be causativized. Ditransitives can also be causativized.

The subject of the first causal form becomes the causative agent of the second causal form. Sentence (2) is the example of basic intransitive and sentences (3) and (4) are its causative forms. ➢ Type-2: Basic Transitive verb type-I (which is similar to khaanaa ‘to eat’ verb type given by Kachru (1966)) ➢ Type-3: Basic Transitive verb type-II (which is similar to karnaa ‘to eat’ verb type given by Kachru (1966)) Type-2 and type-3 are transitive verbs which are divided into two types based on their causativization behavior.

This paper presents the preliminary work on Hindi causative verbs. 2 Causative Verbs Causative verbs mean that some actor makes somebody else do something or causes him to be in a certain state (Agnihotri, 2007). The causal verb indicates the causing of another to do something, instead of doing it oneself (Greaves, 1983). Semantically causative verbs refer to a causative situation which has two components: (a) the causing situation or the antecedent; (b) the caused situation or the consequent. These two combine to make a causative situation (Nedyalkov and Silnitsky, 1973). There are different ways in which causation is indicated in different languages. There are three types of causatives: Morphological causatives, Periphrastic causatives and Lexical causatives (Comrie, 1981). Morphological Causatives indicate causation with the help of verbal affixes. Sanskrit, Hindi/Urdu, Persian, Arabic, Hebrew, Japanese, Khmer and Finnish languages have morphological causatives. Periphrastic causatives indicate causation with the help of a verb which occurs along with the main verb. For example, in English in a sentence such as: (1) John made the child drink milk. In the ab</context>

The agent of the base verb khol ‘open’ is not realized on the surface level of the derived intransitive verb khul ‘open’ though it is implied semantically. Here there is both forward and backward derivation. From base verb to the derived intransitive it is a backward derivation which means there is a reduction of one argument from base verb to the derived intransitive verb (Tripathi, 1986; Reinhart, 2005). In this paper, we motivate our work by presenting our approach for classifying the causative verbs in Hindi. 4 Our Approach 4.1 Linguistic Model for Classifying Causative verbs We have followed Paninian Grammatical framework in this model as the theoretical basis for our approach. The meaning of every verbal root (dhaatu) consists of: (a) activity (vyaapaara) and; (b) result (phala). Activity denotes the actions carried out by the various participants (karakas) involved in the action. Result denotes the state that is reached, when the action is completed (Bharati et al., 1995).

So in (10), caabii 122 ‘key’ is an inanimate noun and takes se ‘with’ postposition so caabii se ‘with the key’ acts as instrument and mohan ‘Mohan’ acts as the prayojya karta ‘causee’ (Kachru, 1966). It seems that only those verbs can be causativized which take an animate karta. Out of the above two given approaches, we are following approach II where both morphology and semantics are considered. In our approach we are saying that only those base verbs can be causativized which take an animate karta and it should also have volitionality (Tripathi, 1986; Reinhart, 2005). Those base verbs which take an inanimate karta can’t be causativized. So in our approach the prayojya karta ‘causee’ in the causative sentence is always animate as the karta of the base verb becomes the prayojya karta ‘causee’ in the causative sentences. In our approach we have the notion of karmakartri which says an intransitive can be derived out of a basic transitive verb and the karma of the basic transitive verb becomes the karta of the derived intransitive verb. So the karta of the derived intransitive verb is called karmakartri. The derived intransitive verbs are like unaccusative ver</context>
