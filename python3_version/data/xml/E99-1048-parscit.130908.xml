Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999804571428571">
This project measures and classifies lan-
guage variation. In contrast to earlier
dialectology, we seek a comprehensive
characterization of (potentially gradual)
differences between dialects, rather than
a geographic delineation of (discrete) fea-
tures of individual words or pronuncia-
tions. More general characterizations of
dialect differences then become available.
We measure phonetic (un)relatedness
between dialects using Levenshtein dis-
tance, and classify by clustering dis-
tances but also by analysis through mul-
tidimensional scaling.

lassen (Blancquaert and Pee, 1925 1982)). It con-
tains 1,956 Netherlandic and North Belgian tran-
scriptions of 141 sentences. We chose 104 dialects,
regularly scattered over the Dutch language area,
and 100 words which appear in each dialect text,
and which contain all vowels and consonants.
Comparison is based on Levenshtein distance,
a sequence-processing algorithm which speech
recognition has also used (Kruskal, 1983). It cal-
culates the &amp;quot;cost&amp;quot; of changing one word into an-
other using insertions, deletions and replacements.
L-distance (si, 82) is the sum of the costs of the
cheapest set of operations changing s1 to sz-
sDagIrl delete r 1

Sum distance 4
The example above illustrates Levenstein distance
applied to Bostonian and standard American pro-
nunciations of saw a girl. Kessler (1995) applied
Levenshtein distance to Irish dialects. The ex-
ample simplifies our procedure for clarity: refine-
ments due to feature sensitivity are omitted. To
obtain the results below, costs are refined based
on phonetic feature overlap. Replacement costs
vary depending on the phones involved. Differ-
ent feature systems were tested; the results shown
are based on Hoppenbrouwers&apos; (SPE-like) features
(Hoppenbrouwers and Hoppenbrouwers, 1988).
Comparing two dialects results in a sum of 100
word pair comparisons. Because longer words
tend to be separated by more distance than
shorter words, the distance of each word pair is
normalized by dividing it by the mean lengths
of the word pair. This results in a halfrnatrix of
distances, to which (i) clustering may be applied
to CLASSIFY dialects (Aldenderfer and Blashfield,
1984); while (ii) multidimensional scaling may be
applied to extract the most significant dimensions
(Kruskal and Wish, 1978).

We have validated the technique using cross-
validation on unseen Dutch dialect data (Ner-
bonne and Heeringa, 1999). The map in Fig-
ure 1 distinguishes Dutch &amp;quot;dialect area&amp;quot; in a way
which nonstatistical methods have been unable to
do (without resorting to subjective choices of dis-
tinguishing features). Ongoing work applies the
technique to questions of convergence/divergence
of dialects using dialect data from two different
periods. Finally, the MDS analysis gives math-
ematical form to the intuition of dialectologists
in Dutch (and other areas) that the material is
best viewed as a &amp;quot;continuum&amp;quot;. The map is ob-
tained by interpreting MDS dimensions as col-
ors and mixing using inverse distance weighting.
