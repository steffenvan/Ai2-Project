This volume contains the papers accepted for presentation at the EACL 2009 Workshop on Cognitive
Aspects of Computational Language Acquisition, held in Athens, Greece on the 31st of March, 2009.
This workshop is the second of a series which was initiated during ACL 2007, held in Prague. The first
edition of the workshop was organised by Anna Korhonen, Paula Buttery and Aline Villavicencio.
The past decades have seen a massive expansion in the application of statistical and machine learning
methods to natural language processing (NLP). This work has yielded impressive results in numerous
speech and language processing tasks including speech recognition, morphological analysis, parsing,
lexical acquisition, semantic interpretation, and dialogue management. Advances in these areas are
generally viewed as engineering achievements, but recently researchers have begun to investigate the
relevance of computational learning techniques to research on human language acquisition. These
investigations have double significance since an improved understanding of human language acquisition
will not only benefit cognitive sciences in general, but may also feed back to the NLP community, placing
researchers in a better position to develop new language models and/or techniques.
Success in this type of research requires close collaboration between NLP and cognitive scientists. The
aim of this workshop is thus to bring together researchers from the diverse fields of NLP, machine
learning, artificial intelligence, linguistics, psycho-linguistics, etc. who are interested in the relevance
of computational techniques for understanding human language learning. The workshop is intended to
bridge the gap between the computational and cognitive communities, promote knowledge and resource
sharing, and help initiate interdisciplinary research projects.
In the call for papers we solicited papers describing cognitive aspects of computational language
acquisition. The programme committee has selected 7 papers for publication that are representative of the
state-of-the-art in this interdisciplinary area. Each full-length submission was independently reviewed
by three members of the program committee, who then collectively faced the difficult task of selecting a
subset of papers for publication from a very strong field.
We would like to thank our two invited speakers, Massimo Poesio and Robert Berwick, all the authors
who submitted papers, as well as the members of the programme committee for the time and effort they
contributed in reviewing the papers. Our thanks go also to the organisers of the main conference, the
publication chairs, and the conference workshop committee headed by Miriam Butt and Stephen Clark.

Conceptual Descriptions: Evidence from Corpora, the Mind, and the Brain
Massimo Poesio
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.960301347826087">
All too often work in computational linguistics on the acquisition of conceptual descriptions takes place
in isolation from work on concepts in psychology and neural science. We feel this is a mistake as
evidence from these related disciplines can provide us with better ways of evaluating our results. In
the talk I will present work in CIMEC on using cognitive evidence to evaluate the results of lexical
acquisition work - specifically, using feature norms to evaluate the acquisition of features, and using
EEG data to evaluate the results of categorization experiments.
Joint work with Marco Baroni, Brian Murphy, Eduard Barbu, and Abdulrahman Almuhareb, among
others.
Treebank Parsing and Knowledge of Language: A Cognitive Perspective
Robert C. Berwick
Over the past 15 years, there has been increasing use of linguistically annotated sentence collections such
as the LDC Penn Tree Bank (PTB) for constructing statistically based parsers. While these parsers have
generally been built for engineering purposes, more recently such approaches have been advanced as
potential cognitive solutions, e.g., for the problem of human language acquisition. Here we examine this
possibility critically: we assess how well these Treebank parsers actually approach human/child language
competence. We find that such systems fail to replicate many, perhaps most, empirically attested
grammaticality judgments; seem overly sensitive, rather than robust, to training data idiosyncrasies; and
easily acquire unnatural syntactic constructions never attested in human languages. Overall, we conclude
that existing statistically based treebank parsers fail to incorporate much knowledge of language in these
three senses. We discuss the implications of these results for the improvement of Treebank parsers and
their cognitive relevance.
Joint work with Professor Sandiway Fong, University of Arizona.
