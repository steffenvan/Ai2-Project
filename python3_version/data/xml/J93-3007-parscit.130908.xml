Bipin Indurkhya has written a wide-ranging and interesting work that is easy to read.
Although Indurkhya&apos;s starting point is the puzzle of similarity-creating metaphors, the
book is really about cognition and conceptual structure. In particular, he is concerned
with the philosophical problem of reconciling the constructive nature of our concepts
with the notion of a pre-existing mind-independent structure of reality. While the book
covers a great deal of ground and is well worth reading, I feel that the basic theory
is flawed in that it rests on a common philosophical view of meaning that has been
considered inadequate.

In Chapter 1, Indurkhya gives his characterization of metaphor, examines examples,
and relates metaphor to models, analogies, and similes. Metaphor is &amp;quot;an unconven-
tional way of describing (or representing) an object, event, or situation (real or imag-
ined) as another object, event, or situation&amp;quot; (p. 36). In Chapter 2, he examines several
examples of similarity-creating metaphors, and claims that no existing account has ad-
equately explained how metaphor creates similarity. He concludes that the creation
of similarity is a cognitive problem: &amp;quot;How is it that an object can be conceptualized
differently, with new attributes and structures being created, but this creation is not
arbitrary?&amp;quot; (p. 90). Accordingly, in Chapter 4, he considers a view of cognition, the
interaction view, that attempts to answer this question. The paradox of interactionism,
in his view, arises from maintaining both that the attributes and structures a cogni-
tive agent uses to conceptualize its environment can be created differently, and that
this creation is not arbitrary but somehow constrained by an environment that does
not have a pre-existing structure. Indurkhya concludes that neither the philosophical
tradition from Kant to Goodman, Piaget&apos;s constructivism, nor Lakoff and Johnson&apos;s
experiential view adequately resolves this paradox.
These first four chapters constitute part I of the book, &amp;quot;The Problem.&amp;quot; In Part II,
&amp;quot;A Theory,&amp;quot; Indurkhya reveals his interactionist approach to cognition (Chapter 5),
gives a formal characterization of this theory (Chapter 6), and develops his theory
of metaphor (Chapter 7). I will discuss these chapters more fully below. Part III of
the book, &amp;quot;The Implications,&amp;quot; applies his theoretical framework to other concerns
surrounding metaphor. Chapter 8 examines issues including the claim that all lan-
guage is metaphorical, the truth-status of metaphor, and the aptness of metaphor.

In Chapter 5, Indurkhya distinguishes three levels of reality to resolve the paradox
of interactionism. The first is a God&apos;s-eye view of reality, which cannot be known by
the cognitive agent but which possesses a mind-independent autonomous structure. A
cognitive agent can interact with this level of reality through its sensory and motor ap-
paratus, and through this interaction may partially receive evidence of the autonomous
structure of reality. The second level of reality is the sense impressions that are made
available for conceptualization through the sensorimotor apparatus of the cognitive
agent. Indurkhya calls this the sensorimotor data set, and he maintains that while the
make-up (or &apos;ontology&apos;) of this data set is determined by the biological form of our
senses and motor apparatus, the patterns of stimulus perceived are determined by the
structure of the external world. The third level of reality is defined to be the conceptual
level, what Indurkhya calls the environment.
The environment consists of both internal representations of the cognitive agent,
called concept-networks, and cognitive relations that connect concepts in the concept-
networks with parts of the sensorimotor data set. Indurkhya maintains that the concept-
networks, which consist of structured sets of symbols and operators, are purely syn-
tactic systems that are meaningless until they are associated or &apos;instantiated&apos; with the
sensorimotor data set. An instantiated concept-network is called a cognitive model. In-
durkhya explains that it is beyond the scope of his book to address the question of
how these concept-networks come about, but these networks might be either learned,
derived from another existing network, or inherited genetically. The cognitive relation
is a correspondence between the symbols and operators of the concept-network, and the
objects and transformations of the environment, respectively. A key part of Indurkhya&apos;s
scheme is that the same concept-network can have different mappings to the same set
of sense-data, thus creating different environments.
Some cognitive relations possess what he calls coherency. This means there is an
isomorphism between the structure of the concept-network and the environment. Since
coherent cognitive models are the most useful for a cognitive agent in making pre-
dictions about the environment, Indurkhya introduces two cognitive mechanisms to
keep cognitive models coherent. The first mechanism, accommodation, restructures the
concept-network to better fit the environment. The second mechanism, projection, keeps
the current concept-network but alters its mappings to the environment; it is this mech-
anism that will explain similarity-creating metaphors.
Indurkhya introduces an interesting example in order to explicate these notions.
He supposes a simple cognitive agent named Spinner, who lives in the two-dimensional
world of Flatland along with several straight lines. Spinner has a very simple senso-
rimotor data set: five light-sensitive cells that can also serve as an effectory organ for
emitting short bursts of air. The &apos;eye&apos; cells and the air bursts allow Spinner to interact
with the straight lines inhabiting its world. The &apos;God&apos;s-eye reality&apos; consists of the lines
and their orientation in the world, but Spinner can only perceive them in a limited
way through its sensorimotor data set. Indurkhya describes the behavior of the world
as follows:
The lines love to spin around, and can often be seen dancing wildly.
Spinner can also cause the line in its zone, if there is one facing it, to

spin. In fact, Spinner loves doing that (and so do the lines), so much so
that over the generations &apos;mental structures&apos; have evolved in Spinner
that reflect its understanding of the behavior of the lines, as well as
its ways of affecting this behavior. (p. 141)
The &apos;mental structures&apos; that Spinner has evolved are concept-networks consisting of
symbols for different visual vectors and operators that specify how one symbol can
be derived from others. Once this concept-network is interpreted by associating it with
the sensorimotor data set, the symbols of the network correspond to the objects in
the environment (in this case, different visual vectors of lines), and the operators
correspond to actions by Spinner or other causes that change these objects (different
streams of air that cause the lines to move).
In some cases, different orientations of a line will be indistinguishable solely on the
basis of the input vector from Spinner&apos;s &apos;eye.&apos; But Spinner may still evolve different
concepts if there is a difference in behavior. Here is a case where different concepts are
mapped to the same sense-data; in other cases, one concept may &apos;group&apos; two (or more)
different sense-data—for example, where different actions by Spinner produce results
that are indistinguishable. Indurkhya explores how Spinner adapts if its world is then
changed: it has to either restructure its concept-network by creating new concepts
(accommodation) or reinterpret the mapping from its current concept-network to the
new sense data (projection), or both.
Indurkhya points out that a more complex cognitive system could vary the thresh-
old of its perceptual organs. This ability for greater variation suggests similar mech-
anisms of accommodation and projection by which the perceptual apparatus itself
creates the sensorimotor data set out of the world of things-in-themselves. Such a
cognitive system may have many layers of concept-networks and mappings between
them, with each successive layer representing different groupings and higher levels of
abstraction. Between every layer, the mechanisms of accommodation and projection
allow the cognitive agent to adjust and reinterpret one layer to another. But this re-
structuring is always constrained by the autonomous structure of the raw sense-data
from the perceptual organs. These mechanisms explain how an object can be conceived
of differently without the creation of new attributes and structure being arbitrary.
Having constructed this apparatus of cognition, Indurkhya formulates his interac-
tion theory of metaphor in Chapter 7. Using the notion of a layered cognitive system,
he defines the source or subject of the metaphor as a concept-network that is instanti-
ated in the lower-level environment or realm of a different concept-network. This new
realm is the target or vehicle of the metaphor. The realm of the target domain can
be either a sensorimotor data set or an &apos;imagined&apos; perceptual experience constructed
from sensorimotor data sets encountered in the past. This imagined experience is a
concept-network placed in the intermediate layers of the cognitive system. Some of the
concepts of the source will have a conventional instantiation in the new realm—that
is, they will correspond to the way that the cognitive agent habitually interprets the
concept; but other concepts cannot be interpreted conventionally in the new realm,
and the cognitive agent will have to instantiate these in a nonconventional way. Thus,
metaphor is essentially a projection of one concept-network onto the realm of another.
This explains Indurkhya&apos;s characterization of metaphor as an unconventional way of
describing (or representing) an object, event, or situation (real or imagined) as another
object, event, or situation.

Indurkhya&apos;s approach is basically a logicist view of language and meaning: our concep-
tual schemes are formal symbol systems that only take on meaning when interpreted in
sense-data; and metaphor is simply a nonstandard interpretation. Thus, as the logical
positivists held, meaning is only a matter of logical syntax plus reference. Indurkhya&apos;s
crucial cognitive relation, the process whereby the concept-network is instantiated, is
not defined. There is a notion of instantiation and interpretation for logical systems
whereby the truth conditions of quantifiers, functions, and predicates is explicated in
terms of individuals, but this does not give us a cognitive mechanism. Nor does it
explain how creating a link between a symbol and sense-data can create meaning.
Another major drawback is that meaning is seen as internal and completely tied to
each individual&apos;s senses. As Wittgenstein&apos;s (1984) argument against private language
has shown, inner experiences are too subjective and unreliable to form a basis for
linguistic meaning; instead, meaning must have a public element. But it is unclear how
this public element or any kind of context can play a role in Indurkhya&apos;s scheme. His
approach is completely driven by sense-data, from the bottom up, and it is unlikely
that different groupings and orderings of observables alone can account for all the
complexity of our abstract concepts and schemes.
Indurkhya is using the logician&apos;s sense of model when he insists that concept-
networks are meaningless. But if these networks are totally meaningless, how does
the internal structure arise in the first place, and how can it possibly correspond to
perceptions of the world? Indurkhya supposes the mental structures reflecting Spin-
ner&apos;s understanding of the line&apos;s behavior have somehow &apos;evolved&apos;; but if these struc-
tures come about evolutionarily through interaction with the environment, then their
structure must have meaning. I have advocated elsewhere (Way 1991; Aronson, Harre,
and Way, in press) that the sense of model for cognitive systems should be that of the
scientist rather than the logician, where the relations among the parts of the model
determine meaning instead of formal isomorphisms. Mental models are more than just
syntactic representations, and, as I have argued, it is in virtue of the manipulation of
meaningful representations that metaphor takes place.
Indurkhya&apos;s book is a valiant effort to produce a unified answer to some difficult
problems in metaphor, cognition, and meaning; and he has pulled together interesting
and valuable research in these fields along the way. However, the basis on which he
builds his theory, a logicist view of language and meaning, contains serious problems
for explicating metaphor and cognition.
