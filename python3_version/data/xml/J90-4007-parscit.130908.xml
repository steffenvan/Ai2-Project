Turing machine (the author asserts that it has never been
built!), nonstandard logics, or nonmonotonic reasoning.
The chapter on expert systems does not really explain what
an expert system is, nor how it works, nor how it could be
used by a CALL system. So these topics will be rather
confusing for the nonspecialists.
To conclude, it seems to me that this book will not
contribute to familiarizing language teachers with notions
of computer science and artificial intelligence.

Readers of Computational Linguistics who might have
been led by the title of this book to expect an introduction to
computational problems in the Chinese, Japanese, and
Korean languages will in fact find little of relevance. The
title is misleading: the book is not about Chinese, Japanese,
and Korean computing. It is almost entirely about the
problems of input, coding, and display of Chinese charac-
ters. It has a great deal to say about the nature and history
of Chinese characters, and about the problems of using
them in computation. It ignores the phonetic scripts used in
conjunction with characters in Japan and Korea, and dis-
cusses Chinese characters mainly from the perspective of
Taiwan rather than the People&apos;s Republic of China.
If you want to learn about Chinese characters, or to
develop computer systems for the Chinese market, you
should probably read this book, because it has a lot of
information on the subject. If not, you might like to read
the book for amusement, since rarely does such a personal,
egotistic, chauvinistic, and polemic book see the light of
day. (It is certainly rare for a book author to give himself
&amp;quot;ten thousand thanks&amp;quot; for his own work on a standardiza-
tion committee; and we do not accept the yin-yang—based
symbol of the I Ching as evidence that the Chinese invented
the fundamental theory of computation.)
Chapter 2, &amp;quot;About the Chinese language,&amp;quot; is actually
about Chinese characters rather than the language. This
chapter gives a good account of history, structure, and
sounds of characters, and includes many figures and tables.
Other chapters and several appendices give statistical data
on characters and phonetic symbols. These parts of the
book could be very useful to someone interested in the
details of Chinese character input, coding, and display.
The book is written in a &amp;quot;Chineselized&amp;quot; version of En-
glish (to use a word much favored by the authors). It would
have benefited greatly from a reading by an English-
speaking copyeditor, and a typographer should have been
consulted about the design. The content should also have
been checked more carefully, as illustrated by Rule 3 of the
Dai-E coding method, the complete text of which is: &amp;quot;If the
character is comprised of a container without another
radical, then rule 3 will not apply&amp;quot; (p. 137).
In Chapter 7, the book goes beyond Chinese I/O to
consider Chinese programming languages and operating
systems, though the authors seem to have some misconcep-
tions about what is available to non-Chinese speakers.
&amp;quot;Total control of a given computer system means that the
human users must be able to communicate with the com-
puter system in their human native language without hin-
dera nce [sic]&amp;quot; (p. 253). &amp;quot;Could you imagine English speak-
ing people having to write their programs in another
language? What would the result be?&amp;quot; (p. 254). &amp;quot;It is not
an English operating system, if it cannot communicate with
the user in plain English&amp;quot; (p. 255). Readers of Computa-
tional Linguistics will presumably now step up their re-
search so that they can develop the first English operating
system.
FORTH is the sole programming language that merits
the authors&apos; approval, seemingly because it emulates Chi-
nese philosophy:
The second similarity between Chinese philosophy and
FORTH can be found in the dual functions of the
FORTH interpreter/compiler. The FORTH interpreter
is an interpretive compiler as well as compilative inter-
preter. It is one of two, two of one. This is similar to

Chinese thoughts on the combinations of heaven and
man. Heaven is the man, and man is the heaven. Good is
evil, and evil is good. The universe is but one. It is very
Zen-ish. If you look from this angle, it is yin, but, if you
look from another angle, it is also yang. Yin and Yang
are one. (p. 267)
An unintentionally self-referential comment (actually
used about the work of the People&apos;s Republic of China on
character coding) occurs on page 211: &amp;quot;What kind of mad
joke this mess is?&amp;quot; As the authors mysteriously say (p. 49):
&amp;quot;The history of Shr3 Huang2 Di4 of the Chin2 Dynasty
should be a mirror for all of us to reflect on and learn from.&amp;quot;

Cognitive Linguistics will be a forum for high-quality research
into language as an instrument for organizing, processing, and
conveying information.. . . The formal structures of language are
studied not as if they were autonomous, but as reflections of
general conceptual organization, categorization principles, process-
ing mechanisms, and experiential and environmental influences.
As language is not to be isolated from the other faculties of man,
cognitive linguistics has an interdisciplinary openness to the other
cognitive sciences. Consequently, contributions to the journal may
adopt either a linguistic point of view, such as language-specific
description, typological comparison, historical and variational
studies, theoretical and formal modeling; or they may assume that
perspective of a neighboring discipline such as psycholinguistic
experimentation, anthropological fieldwork, computer simulation,
and philosophical analysis—From the Editorial Statement, issue

Those who process natural language necessarily process text.
Smith&apos;s Introduction to text processing covers nuts-and-bolts
implementation matters of text processing from data entry through
encryption and compression to concordance generation and ma-
chine translation. Other topics covered are document storage and
retrieval, text editors, string matching, macroprocessors, text
formatters, hyphenation algorithms, spelling checkers, writers&apos;
tools, statistical authorship studies, and automatic abstraction.
Some topics are treated in considerable detail; some that would
normally require books of their own, such as IR and MT, receive
overviews. Generally speaking, the technical material is strong
and well presented.
Curiously omitted is any discussion of character sets: ASCII,
its limitations, and the many recent proposals for extensions. (The
