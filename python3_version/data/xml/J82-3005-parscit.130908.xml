Secretary-Treasurer&apos;s Report
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999957902439024">
Don Walker reviewed the financial status of the
ACL for 1981 and the period of 1982 through June
11. The income figures for the two periods were
$47,901 and $26,363.41, respectively; the correspond-
ing expenses, $41,610 and $18,878; the balances,
$6,291 and $7,485; and the assets, $37,936 and
$45,422. The ACL is doing well, although it was
noted that no expenses for the 1982 AJCL volume
have yet been incurred. [A detailed report is append-
ed to these Minutes.]
He presented the latest membership figures, point-
ing out that personal memberships had almost doubled
between 1979/80 and 1981 — from 658 to 1208
through June 11 — while institutional memberships had
increased slightly. The values for 1982 are not indica-
tive, since many people send dues in late, and no re-
minder notice has yet been mailed. Reflecting on the
closeness of the membership drive to the target 1500
requirement for continuing membership in the Ameri-
can Federation of Information Processing Societies,
the Executive Committee has approved a 20th Anni-
versary new member dues rate of $10 for 1982.
Those present at the business meeting were asked to
inform people about the new rate and encourage them
to become members. The Executive Committee also
established an International Fund that will be used to
provide membership and publications for people in
countries where it is difficult to use national currencies
for international transactions. Again, those present at
the business meeting were encouraged to contribute
and to inform others about the existence of the new
fund. [The membership figures for 1977, 1978,
1979/80, 1981, and 1982 (through June 11) are ap-
pended to these Minutes.]
Candy Sidner (a member of the Membership Com-
mittee), reflecting on the cost and effort entailed in
the membership drive (carried out under Jim Moore&apos;s
general direction), suggested that such drives might
best be conducted every five years. Walker noted that
there are still major groups in microcomputers and in
office automation that have not yet been contacted.

Lance Miller announced that the two sessions held
at the AFIPS Office Automation Conference in April
had been successful. Karen Jensen, Nina Macdonald,
Brian Phillips, and Don Walker presented papers on
&amp;quot;Processing the Natural Language Content of Office
Text.&amp;quot; Alan Biermann, Jaime Carbonell, Gary Hen-
drix, and Fred Thompson presented papers on
&amp;quot;Controlling Office Systems via Natural Language.&amp;quot;
Both session were chaired by George Heidorn.
[Descriptions of the sessions are included in the AJCL,
Volume 7, Number 3, July-September 1981, pages
180-181.]
Martha Evens reported that the ACL activities held
earlier in June at the AFIPS National Computer Con-
ference also went well. Robert Amsler, James Peter-
son, and Raoul Smith presented papers on &amp;quot;Processing
and Generating Text Using Machine-Readable
Dictionaries&amp;quot; in a session chaired by Evens. Elaine
Rich organized a session on &amp;quot;Natural Language Help
Systems&amp;quot; that also included Phil Hayes, Bill Mark, and
Lynn Price. Evens expressed her appreciation to Paul
Orgren and Raoul Smith for their help. [Descriptions
of the sessions are included in the AJCL, Volume 7,
Number 4, October-December 1981, pages 262-263.]
Bea Oshika described plans for the meeting on
Applied Natural Language Processing scheduled for
1-3 February 1983. It will feature work on natural
language interfaces, speech, and translation; system
demonstrations will be included, and a set of half-day
tutorials is being planned.
Other conferences in which the ACL will be in-
volved include the Computer-Human Interface, organ-
ized by the new ACM Special Interest Group to be
held in December 1983, in Boston, Massachusetts, and
the COLING-84 meeting to be held on July 2-6,
1984, at Stanford University in Stanford, California,
for which the ACL will handle local arrangements.

Aravind Joshi announced that the ACL has just
completed arrangements with Cambridge University
Press for publication of a new series entitled &amp;quot;Studies
in Natural Language Processing&amp;quot; for which he will be
the General Editor. Paul Chapin was responsible for
the organizational work associated with its develop-
ment. Members are encouraged to contribute manu-
scripts for consideration.

European Chapter
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999843111111111">
Harry Somers described the motivation behind the
establishment of a European Chapter for the ACL.
Its primary objectives would be to simplify dues pay-
ment and to provide an opportunity for European
members, few of whom can attend the ACL annual
meetings, to have an opportunity to get together. It
would also provide a mechanism for simplifying the
distribution of mailings to European members. The
establishment of a chapter required amending the ACL
Constitution; draft copies of the proposed revisions
were circulated to the membership earlier in the
Spring. Robinson asked for approval of the proposed
amendments, and they were affirmed unanimously. [A
copy of the revised ACL Constitution is appended to
these minutes.] She remarked that the Executive Com-
mittee, now authorized to establish chapters, would
meet the next day to approve a constitution for the
European Chapter.

Stan Petrick stated that he and Fred Damerau have
been acting as temporary editors for the American
Journal of Computational Linguistics, following George
Heidorn&apos;s resignation. They hope to have the next
issue ready by August; nine papers are being proc-
essed; sixteen others are being reviewed.

Announcements

<bodyText confidence="0.999373133333333">
Walker remarked that reports on graduate programs
in computational linguistics and on careers are being
prepared. He noted that the ACL office receives fre-
quent requests for information on selected areas in
computational linguistics, and asked that people volun-
teer to prepare short statements covering topics they
are particularly interested in.
Graeme Hirst suggested that the term &amp;quot;American&amp;quot;
in the title of the AJCL was not appropriate and that a
change in the name should be considered. Robinson,
responding to the sense of the meeting, agreed to have
the Executive Committee act on his suggestion.
Walker announced that Martin Kay would receive
an honorary doctorate from the University of Gothen-
burg, Sweden, in October.

<abstract confidence="0.9330908">in Natural Language Processing&amp;quot; for which he will be the General Editor. Paul Chapin was responsible for the organizational work associated with its development. Members are encouraged to contribute manuscripts for consideration. European Chapter Harry Somers described the motivation behind the establishment of a European Chapter for the ACL. Its primary objectives would be to simplify dues payment and to provide an opportunity for European members, few of whom can attend the ACL annual meetings, to have an opportunity to get together. It would also provide a mechanism for simplifying the distribution of mailings to European members. The establishment of a chapter required amending the ACL Constitution; draft copies of the proposed revisions were circulated to the membership earlier in the Spring. Robinson asked for approval of the proposed amendments, and they were affirmed unanimously. [A copy of the revised ACL Constitution is appended to these minutes.] She remarked that the Executive Committee, now authorized to establish chapters, would meet the next day to approve a constitution for the European Chapter. Editor&apos;s Report Stan Petrick stated that he and Fred Damerau have acting as temporary editors for the of Computational Linguistics, George Heidorn&apos;s resignation. They hope to have the next issue ready by August; nine papers are being processed; sixteen others are being reviewed. Announcements Walker remarked that reports on graduate programs in computational linguistics and on careers are being prepared. He noted that the ACL office receives frequent requests for information on selected areas in computational linguistics, and asked that people volunteer to prepare short statements covering topics they are particularly interested in. Graeme Hirst suggested that the term &amp;quot;American&amp;quot; the title of the not appropriate and that a change in the name should be considered. Robinson, responding to the sense of the meeting, agreed to have the Executive Committee act on his suggestion. Walker announced that Martin Kay would receive an honorary doctorate from the University of Gothenburg, Sweden, in October. Resolutions Committee Report Ray Perrault expressed the appreciation of the ACL to Lyn Bates and her Program Committee for the content of the conference; to Jim and Renee Moore and to Candy Sidner for their work on the membership drive; to George Heidorn for having the copy version into reality; to Stan Petrick and Fred Damerau for taking over editing responsibility on short notice; to Michael McCord for valuable services as Associate Editor; to IBM for continued support of the editorial activity; to Stan Petrick and Terry Langendoen for organizing the ACL sessions at the Linguistic Society of America meeting in</abstract>
