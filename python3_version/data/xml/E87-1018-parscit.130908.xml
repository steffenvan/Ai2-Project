<bodyText confidence="0.986217954545455">
An adequate, complete, and economical
linguistic theory is necessary for MT and
the question is whether a consistent use
of the often unduly neglected dependency
syntax, including a systematic description
of topic and focus, cannot serve as a re-
liable base for the grammar of an inter-
lingua, or of a set of interrelated inter-
face structures.
1. As Slocum (1985) convinc*ly shows, the
attitude towards translation in general,
and therefore also towards automatic trans-
lation in the U.S.A. never has been based
on urgent wide-spread needs of translating
technical texts, and mostly has not been
connected with broad interest in theoreti-
cal background. Outside the U.S.A., with
the exception of G.E.T.A., Grenoble, the
research had the character of scattered
projects carried out by relatively small
groups; only in the recent years the EUROTRA
project and, especially, the two Japanese
projects bring some hope as for the possi-
bility of sufficiently concentrated re-
search.
The question whether linguistics is able
to offer a reliable theoretical basis for
MT cannot be answered in a qualified way
without examining such linguistically based
systems as Garvin&apos;s-fulcrum&amp;quot; approach (which
was abolished on external grounds, after
the unfortunate ALPAC report) or the sys-
tems formulated by Kulagina and Apresyan.
Certain features of their frameworks, as
well as of Vauquois- (1975; Vauquois and
Boitet, 1985) are more closely connected to
classical structural linguistics than is
the case with other MT systems. Also in
Prague, the research group of MT and formal
linguistics at Charles University has de-
voted much effort (starting at the end of
the 1950-s) to identify the positive results
of classical European linguistics and to
reformulate them in a metalanguage that
would make them usable in the context of
Chomskyan (and Montaguean) methodology and
of automated language processing (now see
Sgall et al., 1986).
2. The requirements on linguistic theory
as a background for MT can be summarized as
follows:
(a) Adequacy: The theory should underlie
relatively complete descriptions reflecting
the structure of language. Since humans dif-
fer from computers (in freely combining fac-
tual knowledge and other mental capacities
with their knowledge and use of language,
and in being able to develop their language
while using it), the correspondence between
theory and its MT application cannot be im-
mediate. The open-endedness of language
makes it necessary to restrict the complete-
ness of the description to a reasonably
estimated core of language, leaving,the
(possibly not too large) periphery in&apos;the
application to postediting, etc.

(b) Testability: It follows from (a)
that testability also is limited: not every
counterexample disqualifies a theory.
(c) Economy: To be applicable, the theo-
ry cannot be too complex. It seems necessary
to draw a boundary line between the system
of language on the one side, and its use or
its semantic interpretation on the other,
although in several respects it may be use-
ful for the applications not to follow this
boundary quite exactly.
(d) Modularity: Since huge programs are
extremely difficult to be handled (debugged,
updated, etc.), priority will be given to
such a theory that not only allows for a
division of labour between the description
of linguistic and communicative competence
- see (c), - but makes also a cooperation
between specialists in the different layers
of language itself possible.

The comparison of different approaches
to linguistic theory as to point (a) is a
matter of the theory itself; let us only
note that many theories seem not to be suf-
ficiently adequate in that they do not
properly distinguish between the three di-
mensions of the sentence structure (valency
or theta roles, coordination and apposition,
and also topic and focus, which often is
almost altogether neglected1) and the mor-
phological categories (tense, aspect, num-
ber, definiteness, and so on); the latter
occupy no Immediate positions in the struc-
ture of the sentence with its recursive
properties, and thus it is not adequate to
denote e.g. prepositions as if they per-
1
The relevance of the topic-focus ar-
ticulation for translation and for other
aims of language comprehension can be illus-
trated by the following examples: In the
hallway one smokes should be distinguished
from One smokes in the hallway similarly as
Few books are read by many men from Many
men read few books.
mitted for unlimited complementation, as
verbs do.
For point (b) it is important that the
theory uses operational criteria in delim-
iting its units and oppositions, thus re-
presenting a suitable starting point for
implementable application systems.
With regard to (c), the relative gener-
ality of the formulations used by the the-
ory is relevant; thus e.g. Chomsky&apos;s uni-
versal principles are relatively econom-
ical. On the other hand, the abundance of
nodes in the P-markers (cf. what was just
said on point (a)) brings along the ne-
cessity to use tree pruning and to intro-
duce devices making it possible to find an
orientation in the unnecessarily large
trees.
As for (d), it seems preferable to work
with two levels of sentence structure and
with a separate level of morphemic repre-
sentations in the theory, although in the
applications this pattern may be simplified
(we are then aware what we have left out
e.g. in our parser, and are able to restore
a missing subpart, if this proves to be
necessary, e.g. when the system is to be
generalized to handle new kinds of texts).
A systematic investigation into compar-
ing different linguistic theories from
these viewpoints has resulted in our pre-
ference for dependency grammar, based on
valency or theta roles (see Sgall et al.,
1986, for a detailed discussion). A depend-
ency based linguistic description is ade-
quate in the quoted respect (e.g. the mor-
phological values are denoted here by parts
of complex node labels); the theory is ful-
ly testable and uses operational criteria,
and it ensures both economy (no non-termi-
nal symbols are present in the representa-
tions although as many as necessary can be
used during the derivation procedure) and
modularity (the underlying representations
contain all the semantically relevant in-

formation, since also the topic-focus ar■
ticulation is denoted here).
Bloomfield &apos;s &apos;exocentric&apos; constructions
are often mistakenly understood as an ob-
stacle for dependency syntax; however, as.
Robinson (1970) showed, they can be han-
dled without serious difficulties within
dependency trees. Let us add that, if con-
structions are analyzed in the terms of
word classes (parts of speech), rather than
in those of individual words, than the dis-
tributional properties clearly show that
e.g. your sister is a noun group (since
e.g. Mother or syntax occur withouta deter-
miner), to hit the ball is a verb group
(due to to read,...), and also a sentence
has a verb as its governor, since in It
rains no subject (Actor/Bearer) is present
at the level of meaning (or in the under-
lying structure).
A formal treatment combining dependency
syntax with a description of coordination
and apposition, allowing for an indefinite
number of sister nodes, was presented by
Platek et al. (1984).
As one of the referrresof our papers has
duly recalled, the number of publications
concerning dependency grammar is much
smaller than that on constituent structures
but the popularity of the model is not di-
rectly relevant for its evaluation. There-
fore it seems highly useful to notice the
advantages of the less known model, a more
intensive use of which might be of impor-
tance for the further development of the
field.
3. An interlingua for MT can well be based
on such a theory. Since the 1960s - see
e.g.Mel&amp;quot;duk (1962), Vauquois (1962), Sgall
(1963) - the research in this direction has
been connected with theoretical investiga-
tions. It has been clear that the formula-
tion of an interlingua is a practical task,
for the underlying units differ from one
langgage to the other, so that the struc-
ture of interlingua is based rather on the
structural similarities (formal universals)
of languages than on an assumed identity
of their underlying structures, or their
patternings of meaning.
As for the known difficulties concerning
e.g. the formulation of fail-soft rules or
the presence of surface clues (see Slocum,
1985,5; Vauquois and Boitet, 1985), it ap-
pears that for a multilingual system of MT
these disadvantages have to be compared
with those present in the large number of
binary systems which are otherwise necess-
ary. The difference between the use of an
interlingua and of a smaller number of
&amp;quot;interfaces&amp;quot; (one for each language)appears
not to be crucial. If, for a system includ-
ing n languages, m among them display a
certain opposition (that of dual versus
plural number, or of gender with personal
pronouns, etc.), then the degree of impor-
tance of this opposition for the system
depends. on the difference between n and in
and on the importance of the languages dis-
playing the opposition. Extremely marginal
oppositions will probably be ignored in a
system using interfaces as well as in one
with an interlingua. In this case, a trans-
lation between two languages exhibiting the
marginal opposition will be faced with a
similar problem as a translation from a
&amp;quot;prototypical&amp;quot; language into a &amp;quot;marginal&amp;quot;
one (e.g. the use of dual number will be
determined - perhaps only for some cases -
by contextual clues, rather than by the
presence of dual in the input text).
If the relative weight of such surplus
difficulties (and resulting mistakes) is
considerable, then it may be useful to for-
mulate interfaces, perhaps not always in a
one-to-one correspondence to the processed
languages, but relating to certain groups
of them. Certain &amp;quot;dialectal&amp;quot; differences in
the interlingua would then be useful, each

<bodyText confidence="0.9998971875">
of which would share some opposition(s)
with a group of the processed languages.
This may concern the differences between
languages having and not having articles,
verbal aspects, various moods, and so on.
The substitution of a single interlingua by
a set of closely related interface struc-
tures rsee Vauquois and Boitet, 1985,32; as
for its application in the EUROTRA project,
Johnson et al., 1985,164) perhaps is also
important with regard to handling the se-
mantic relationships between the lexical
units of the languages concerned.
This schematical view can be systemat-
ically elaborated only on the basis of ex-
perience with multilingual MT systems.

4. A not quite negligible experience with
MT systems based (at least to a great part)
on dependency syntax has been gained al-
ready. The Grenoble group has used a graph
grammar based on this approach within a sys-
tem that is multilingual, though centred
aroumdFrench (see Vauquois, 1975; Boitet
and Nedobejkine, 1981; Vauquois and Boitet,
1985,28f); although in this system the de-
pendency relations are used along with a
kind of phrase structure, the importance
of complex node labels and of the syntactic
relations (valency) has always been fully
recognized. Also Nagao et al. (1985,esp.98)
point out that dependency tree structures
are used in their project (which certainly
belongs to those with the best traditions
and results); in the Eurotra system the de-
pendency relations and the notion of -goy
(ernor)- play an important role (see e.g.
Johnson et al., 1985). In Prague, especially
the English-to-Czech translation project,
the main author of which is Kirschner (1982;
1984), is based on a dependency description.
5. The perspectives of MT seem to be con-
nected with two major conditions, in addi-
tion to the choice of an appropriate under-
lying linguistic theory, which we discussed
above:
(a) As is known, for the resolution of
many lexical ambiguities and also for the
identification of grammatically obligatory
values of the target language not present
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.994869615384615">
in the input text, a MT system has to in-
clude not only a purely linguistic descrip-
tion. It has to be found out to what de-
gree the practical purposes of MT can be
achieved by systems &amp;quot;modelling the world&amp;quot;
by such elementary means as sets of seman-
tic features. Where means of this kind
will be found to be insufficient, it is
probable that neither data bases of the
common types will do. It is then necessary
to look for suitable kinds of knowledge
representation systems.
(b) The main perspective appears to be
connected with the hope that a wider prac-
tical application of MT will lead to a new
situation, in which the construction of MT
systems will no longer be a matter of
small research groups scattered and more
or less isolated in different countries,
but there will emerge large-scale and well-
-coordinated international projects based
on the best results achieved and verified
by widespread practical application. Under
such new circumstances it will be possible
not only to compile grammatically well
founded data on tens of thousands of lexi-
cal units from different languages, but
also to connect translation systems in an
effective way with broadly based nets of
knowledge representation. Effective ways
of human-machine interaction can then be
found, and the formulation of appropriate
intermediate languagelswill meet good con-
ditions. Post-editing will certainly re-
main necessary, the main condition being
that it should not be much more difficult
than it is with human translations of
technical texts (although other kinds of
mistakes will prevail).

Bloomfield &apos;s &apos;exocentric&apos; constructions are often mistakenly understood as an obstacle for dependency syntax; however, as. Robinson (1970) showed, they can be handled without serious difficulties within dependency trees. Let us add that, if constructions are analyzed in the terms of word classes (parts of speech), rather than in those of individual words, than the distributional properties clearly show that e.g. your sister is a noun group (since e.g. Mother or syntax occur withouta determiner), to hit the ball is a verb group (due to to read,...), and also a sentence has a verb as its governor, since in It rains no subject (Actor/Bearer) is present at the level of meaning (or in the underlying structure).

The question whether linguistics is able to offer a reliable theoretical basis for MT cannot be answered in a qualified way without examining such linguistically based systems as Garvin&apos;s-fulcrum&amp;quot; approach (which was abolished on external grounds, after the unfortunate ALPAC report) or the systems formulated by Kulagina and Apresyan. Certain features of their frameworks, as well as of Vauquois- (1975; Vauquois and Boitet, 1985) are more closely connected to classical structural linguistics than is the case with other MT systems. Also in Prague, the research group of MT and formal linguistics at Charles University has devoted much effort (starting at the end of the 1950-s) to identify the positive results of classical European linguistics and to reformulate them in a metalanguage that would make them usable in the context of Chomskyan (and Montaguean) methodology and of automated language processing (now see Sgall et al., 1986). 2. The requirements on linguistic theory as a background for MT can be summarized as foll</context>

Certain &amp;quot;dialectal&amp;quot; differences in the interlingua would then be useful, each 101 of which would share some opposition(s) with a group of the processed languages.
