1 An Overview of the system
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98496">
CATMORF (Badia, Egea &amp; Tuells, 1997) is the cen-
tral module of a tagger intended to deal with free
input. It operates on texts structurally marked with
SGML tags and attaches SGML tags to every word
of the text.
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.998373">
Figure 1: General overview of the system
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.999915588235294">
The text-handling module (THM) receives as in-
put the plain text between SGML marks. It as-
signs a tag to the textual items that be handled
by CATMORF: numbers, dates, proper names...(i.e,
the usual pre-process). The input to CATMORF is
the set of textual items to which the text-handler
has not been able to assign a tag.
CATMORF assigns as many tags to each word-
form as morphological analyses are allowed by its
70000 items dictionary and its two-level and word-
grammar rules. The output of CATMORF, in the
form of a set of SGML tags, is returned to the mas-
ter program which assigns a dummy tag to the still
unrecognised words and passes over the tagged text
to the third module.
Currently the tagger is an adaptation to Catalan
of the Multext tagger (Armstrong et al., 1996).

2 Internal structure of CATMORF
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998802333333333">
CATMORF&apos;s internal structure (figure 2) conforms
to the two level paradigm. In the two-level frame-
work, as it is well known, morphographemics is mod-
elled in two-level rules (TLR) and morphotactics ei-
ther in continuation classes or in unification word
grammars (WG). Our system models morphotac-
tics in a (DCG-like) WG and morphographemics in
SEGMORF (Badia &amp; Tuells, 1997), a variant of the
ALEP morphographemic formalism (CEC, 1994).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.986738">
2.1 The TLR module
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99999515">
The main characteristics of the formalism is that
it allows the linguist to express both the mor-
phographemic and morphotacticai contexts thus
constraining the application of TLRs.
Thus a rule in CATMORF may make use of the
following data structures: the Surface Left and Right
morphographemic contexts; the Lexical Left and
Right morphographemic contexts; the Morpholog-
ical Left and Right contexts; and the Application
context (i.e, a feature structure which keeps trace of
the application of rules and which must unify with
the application-FS associated to every morph found
in the lexicon).
As is customary the surface and lexical descrip-
tions in rules are related by four types of operators.
Note that some of the facilities in SEGMORF were
not available in the Alep formalism: the specifica-
tion of the morphotactical context, the possibility of
mapping single characters onto multiple ones, and
the ability to cross morpheme boundaries.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997063">
2.2 The Word Grammar
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999164">
Due to the expressivity of the TLRs the WG can
be very simple: it is a DCG-style grammar, which
builds a word out of the morphemes into which the
surface string has been divided and provides the
morphosyntactic information at the word level.

2.3 CATMORF&apos;s lexicon
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998435">
The items in our lexicon contain information on the
word form and lemma; the inflection paradigm of
verbs, nouns and adjectives (needed for both the WG
and the TLR components); and the blocking of rules
by several classes of stems.
All this information, including the one concerning
the inflection paradigms and the blocking of rules
has been obtained semi-automatically from a MRD
(a conventional &amp;quot;human-reader-in-mind&amp;quot; dictionary
available in electronic form): the IEC dictionary
(IEC, 1996), which is a recent normative dictionary
for Catalan.

The main technical characteristics of our analyzer:

<listItem confidence="0.984765625">
• The system has been written in Sicstus Prolog.
• The system covers nominal and verbal inflection
fully. A few nominal derivation processes are
also covered. 114 rules cover nominal inflection;
10 rules cover verbal inflection.
• The WG has 1 rule for verbal inflection and 15
rules for nominal processes.
• The original MRD contains 67567 entries. Our

lexicon contains 70543 entries; 11092 verbs
(around 9000 stems and 2000 lexicalized verb
forms), 386 verbal suffixes, 56275 nouns and ad-
jectives, 3 nominal suffixes and 2555 adverbs.
The rest of the entries are prepositions, con-
junctions, etc.
• Only around 800 nouns and around 2000 verb
forms have been added to the system by hand.
The rest of the entries (around 60000) have been
added automatically.

4 The Multi two-level steps
framework
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999940714285714">
In Catalan, TL-rules depend on word formation pro-
cesses. 114 rules cover nominal inflection and deriva-
tion processes, whereas only 10 rules cover verbal
inflection; thus, few rules can be considered as ap-
plicable to both inflections.
This shows that Catalan morphology can be more
efficiently accounted for in a multi two-level steps
framework, in which different TLR and WG rule sets
are available, depending on the type of word forma-
tion process to cover (as depicted in figure 2). Mor-
phemes (prefixes, noun stems, verbal stems, etc.) do
not direct to continuation classes (or sublexicons);
instead, word formation processes (according to the
WG) select their appropiate sublexicons.
Note that this framework does not avoid the spec-
ification of morphotactical contexts for those mor-
phographemic changes which involve interaction be-
tween TLRs and the WG. It simply specifies that
for some word formation processes only a subset of
TLRs should be considered. See (Badia &amp; Tuells,
1997) for further considerations.
