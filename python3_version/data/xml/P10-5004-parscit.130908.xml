1. Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.997781692307692">
As researchers seek to apply their machine
learning algorithms to new problems, corpus
annotation is increasingly gaining importance
in the NLP community. But since the
community currently has no general paradigm,
no textbook that covers all the issues (though
Wilcock’s book published in Dec 2009 covers
some basic ones very well), and no accepted
standards, setting up and performing small-,
medium-, and large-scale annotation projects
remains something of an art.
To attend, no special expertise in computation
or linguistics is required.

This tutorial is intended to provide the attendee
with an in-depth look at the procedures, issues,
and problems in corpus annotation, and
highlights the pitfalls that the annotation
manager should avoid. The tutorial first
discusses why annotation is becoming
increasingly relevant for NLP and how it fits
into the generic NLP methodology of train-
evaluate-apply. It then reviews currently
available resources, services, and frameworks
that support someone wishing to start an
annotation project easily. This includes the
QDAP annotation center, Amazon’s
Mechanical Turk, annotation facilities in
GATE, and other resources such as UIMA. It
then discusses the seven major open issues at
the heart of annotation for which there are as
yet no standard and fully satisfactory answers
or methods. Each issue is described in detail
and current practice is shown. The seven
issues are: 1. How does one decide what
specific phenomena to annotate? How does
one adequately capture the theory behind the
phenomenon/a and express it in simple
annotation instructions? 2. How does one
obtain a balanced corpus to annotate, and
when is a corpus balanced (and
representative)? 3. When hiring annotators,
what characteristics are important? How does
one ensure that they are adequately (but not
over- or under-) trained? 4. How does one
establish a simple, fast, and trustworthy
annotation procedure? How and when does
one apply measures to ensure that the
procedure remains on track? How and where
can active learning help? 5. What interface(s)
are best for each type of problem, and what
should one know to avoid? How can one
ensure that the interfaces do not influence the
annotation results? 6. How does one evaluate
the results? What are the appropriate
agreement measures? At which cutoff points
should one redesign or re-do the annotations?
7. How should one formulate and store the
results? When, and to whom, should one
release the corpus? How should one report the
annotation effort and results for best impact?
The notes include several pages of references
and suggested readings.
