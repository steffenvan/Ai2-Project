This paper addresses the problem of learning
phrase patterns for unsupervised speaker role
classification. Phrase patterns are automati-
cally extracted from large corpora, and redun-
dant patterns are removed via a graph prun-
ing algorithm. In experiments on English and
Mandarin talk shows, the use of phrase pat-
terns results in an increase of role classifi-
cation accuracy over n-gram lexical features,
and more compact phrase pattern lists are ob-
tained due to the redundancy removal.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999834476190476">
The identification of speaker roles is fundamental to
the analysis of social content and information re-
liability in conversational speech. Previous work
has primarily used supervised learning in automatic
role classification. Barzilay et al. (2000) described a
speaker role classification system for English broad-
cast news (BN), where the speakers were catego-
rized into three types: anchor, journalist, and guest.
The authors used supervised learning to discover n-
gram signature phrases for speaker introduction and
structural features such as duration, achieving an ac-
curacy of 80% on ASR derived transcripts. Liu et al.
(2006) studied speaker role classification on TDT-4
Mandarin BN data. Hidden Markov and maximum
entropy models were used to label the sequence of
speaker turns with the roles anchor, reporter, and
other, based on n-gram features, which yielded 80%
classification accuracy on human transcripts.
Hutchinson et al. (2010) extend previous work to
the case of unsupervised learning, with the goal of
portability across languages. That work explored

speaker role classification using structural and n-
gram features on talk show (or broadcast conversa-
tion (BC)) data. In this paper, we address a limita-
tion of n-grams as features by proposing a method
for learning phrases with gaps, which is particularly
important for conversational speech, since there are
more disfluencies that can cause failure of n-gram
matching. In addition, we want to avoid topic words
(e.g., proper nouns) in order to model speaker roles
rather than topics. For example, for identifying the
host, the phrase pattern “We’ll be back with * in a
minute” is more general than the n-grams “We’ll be
back with John Smith in a minute.” To prevent these
problems with n-grams, one must limit the length of
learned n-grams, making them less discriminative.
Phrase patterns have been used in other NLP ap-
plications such as (Sun et al., 2007). To remove the
redundancies in the automatically extracted phrase
patterns, we propose a redundancy removal algo-
rithm based on graph pruning that does not require
role-labeled data. The resulting set of patterns is
then used to extract lists of signature and conversa-
tional phrases, from which features are derived that
are used to distinguish between the different roles.
Using the phrase pattern-based lexical features in
clustering, we obtain 82-89% speaker role classifi-
cation accuracy on human transcripts of BC shows.

<bodyText confidence="0.99960625">
Phrase patterns are generalizations of n-grams. A
phrase pattern p of length n is an ordered list of
words (w1, w2, ... , wn). It is matched by a word se-
quence of length m &gt; n if the sequence contains the
words in the order defined by the pattern. Because
the words in a phrase pattern need not appear con-
tiguously in the sequence, phrase matching is less
sensitive to disfluencies and topic words.

2001). This algorithm efficiently extracts frequent
phrase patterns in a corpus (i.e., relative frequency
greater than a given threshold). Prior to the extrac-
tion, we perform text preprocessing including split-
ting the text into lines based on commas and peri-
ods to limit the pattern span, followed by case and
punctuation removal. The extracted phrase patterns
have variable length. As a result, longer patterns
may contain shorter patterns. Phrase patterns with
the same length may also be overlapped. These re-
dundancies should be removed; otherwise, the same
phrase may match several patterns, resulting in bi-
ased counts.

2.2 Phrase Pattern Redundancy Removal
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999976606060606">
Define a phrase pattern p as contained in another
phrase pattern q if q contains all the words in p in the
same order. p is called a parent pattern and q is the
corresponding child pattern. Instead of constructing
a tree as in (Siu et al., 2000) for variable length n-
grams, we create a graph of phrase patterns based
on containment, because a pattern can contain and
be contained by multiple patterns. Our redundancy
removal algorithm involves pruning this graph. With
the nodes being the phrase patterns, the edges of the
phrase pattern graph are constructed by connecting
length-n phrase pattern p to length-(n + 1) phrase
pattern q for all n, if p is contained in q. We con-
nect only phrase patterns that differ by one word in
length for computational efficiency, and this results
in a multi-layer structure: the phrase patterns in each
layer have the same length. For the convenience of
pruning, a virtual node T is created as the “zeroth”-
layer, and it is directly connected to all the nodes in
the layer with the shortest pattern length.
Once a phrase pattern graph has been created, we
prune the graph in order to remove the redundant
nodes. First, we remove edges based on the ratio of
counts c(q)/c(p) between child node q and parent
node p. A large ratio implies that the child appears in
most of the cases where the parent appears. Hence,
we keep the edge to indicate that the child can be
used as a preferred substitute for the parent. On the
other hand, the edge is removed if the ratio is small
(less than a threshold t, see Fig. 1).
After this procedure is performed on all the edges
in the graph, we determine whether a node is pruned
based on its connectivity to parents and children. We

define two levels of pruning, which differ in whether
a node can be preserved even if its connections to
parents are removed:
Conservative pruning A node is pruned if it has at
least one child.
Aggressive pruning A node is pruned if it has at
least one child or is not on a path connected to
T.
Both methods were investigated, in case some useful
phrase patterns ended up being pruned with the more
aggressive approach.

Although (Hutchinson et al., 2010) uses both lex-
ical and structural features, here we use only lexi-
cal features to better assess impact. Once the graph
pruning has provided a list of phrase patterns (elimi-
nating phrases of length one because of low reliabil-
ity), two subsets are extracted to represent signature
phrases as might be used by a host and conversa-
tional phrases as might occur more frequently in live
interviews. The signature statistic

ers whose utterances match p), document frequency
(DF, # shows that match p), and genre-dependent
frequency fBC (# occurrences of p in BC), all com-
puted on the training data. The ratio DF
SF favors
phrases that occur in many documents but few
speakers, e.g. one per show, as for a host. The log
BC frequency term is a penalty to eliminate infre-
quent patterns. The conversation statistic

uses frequency AN (# occurrences of p in BN), to
look for phrases that are more frequent in BC data
than BN, ideally live discussion phenomena. The in-
dicator function 1SF&gt;,a eliminates phrases used by
a small number of speakers to avoid topic-related
phrases. Hyper-parameters a and Q are tuned by in-
specting the top phrase patterns after ranking. We
use a = 10−3,Q = 500 for English and a =
10−4, Q = 1000 for Mandarin. Phrase patterns are
ranked by the two statistics to generate lists of sig-
nature and conversational patterns, respectively.
During speaker-level feature extraction in role de-
tection, each phrase pattern in the lists is matched
against a speaker’s utterances. The lexical features
have two dimensions: the count of matches using the
signature and conversational patterns, each normal-
ized by the total number of patterns matched in the
show to account for differences between shows.

In the absence of speaker-role-labeled conversa-
tional speech training data, we perform unsuper-
vised speaker role classification with three classes:
host, expert guest, and soundbite. We evaluate
on two human-labeled evaluation sets (English and
Mandarin). The English eval set contains nine BC
shows (150 speakers), while the Mandarin eval set
contains 14 shows (140 speakers). There is an addi-
tional labeled Mandarin development set composed
of ten shows (71 speakers). There are on average
7.6k words and 7.5k characters per show for English
and Mandarin, respectively. The phrase patterns are
learned from much larger corpora with speaker la-
bels but without speaker role labels, including web
transcripts for 310 English shows and quick rich
transcripts for 4395 Mandarin shows. Because of
the larger amount of Mandarin data, we use a lower
threshold (5 x 10−5) for phrase pattern extraction
than for English (10−4).

<bodyText confidence="0.999827523809524">
Spectral clustering (Shi and Malik, 2000) is used
in this work, since we found it to outperform other
clustering approaches such as k-means and Gaus-
sian mixture models. Given a two-dimensional fea-
ture vector for each speaker in a show, we con-
struct a speaker graph with edge weights defined
by Gaussian similarity exp(− khz2or2;k2). The spec-
tral clustering is non-deterministic, because it uses
k-means as its final step (k = 3), which is ini-
tialized by randomly choosing k samples as ini-
tial centroids. We vary a as an integer from 1 to
100 in combination with different random initial-
izations to generate multiple clustering alternatives,
and then use a partition selection algorithm to pick
the most common clustering among the candidates.
We use domain knowledge to map speaker clusters
into speaker roles: the cluster whose members have
the largest average number of speaker turns is the
host cluster, that with the smallest average number
of turns is the soundbite cluster, and the remaining
cluster contains the expert guests.

3.4 Discussion
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993978827586207">
The experiments reflect differences between the two
languages. We observe that the main gain in Man-
darin comes from improved classification of hosts,
due to the signature phrase patterns. In English, the
improvement is attributed to improved classification
of expert guests and soundbites, suggesting an im-
proved conversational dimension of the lexical fea-
tures. The performance difference of the two lan-
guages seems more related to the languages them-
selves, rather than the size of data sets on which
phrase patterns are learned, because we were able to
obtain similar performance on Mandarin even when
the training set size is reduced.
Anecdotal inspection of the phrase patterns
learned for the signature phrases suggests that the
combination of redundancy pruning and the heuris-
tic signature statistic is quite effective. For exam-
ple, we observed English signature patterns such
as “back with after this” and “let’s take a look
at.” The former pattern can be matched by phrases
with names or topics inserted, and the latter can be
matched by “let’s just take a look at” or “let’s take
a brief look at.” In the Mandarin signature patterns,
we also found patterns such as “41-:k i*511 is
0 Ag� k * 0 * Jk&amp;” (today the guest invited to
the studio is Professor from) and “i1i1 A,-A * 0 4
AV (thanks to the report from). These patterns can
be considered to be templates for hosts, where the
named-entities are skipped.

4 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999994769230769">
We have presented a method for extracting phrase
patterns with minimum redundancy for speaker role
classification. The proposed algorithm removes
most of the redundancies in the phrase patterns,
leading to more compact pattern lists and improved
classification accuracy over n-gram lexical features.
We can apply the algorithm to other applications
such as text classification, where phrase patterns
can be used in place of n-grams. One way to ex-
tend this work is to use the automatically extracted
phrase patterns as initial features, and then employ
supervised or semi-supervised learning techniques
to learn a more discriminative feature set.
