Book Reviews Genesis: An Authorship Study

From the aspect of divisions, it is shown that Division
I is quite unlike Divisions II and III. In Division I were
included most of J and P, and in Division III most of E.
E appears for the first time in Division II, and from there
it has approximately the same share as J. Division II is
gradually and increasingly individualized, and fully
human true-life portraits appear in Division III, while
Division I has a quasi-mythical nature.
In Phase II, the aim was to let the features arrange
themselves into groups of themselves, as it were, without
any preconceptions. Five analysis methods were applied,
and cluster analysis yielded a most interesting picture of
interrelations among the text samples (figures 3.11, 3.12,
pp. 136-7). The first cluster comprised samples of Text
P. The second cluster comprised most of the N samples
outside P. The third cluster encompassed all the H and D
samples, regardless of their E or J origin. The authors
write explicitly (p. 186): &amp;quot;This adds force . . . to the
impression that the Jahwist and the Elohist were each
other&apos;s alter ego&amp;quot;. The other analyses supported this
finding.
Lexical richness and lexical concentration were sepa-
rately examined, yielding results in three different ranges
of vocabulary for N,H,D (Fig. 4.3) and J,E,P (Fig. 4.4).
Here, too, P is unlike the other groups. After the statis-
tical analysis the authors consider it justified that N,H,D
should be distinct. It is doubtful, to their mind, whether
J,E,P should be ascribed to three different sources. They
summarize this issue as follows: &amp;quot;While solely on these
grounds this [documentary] hypothesis cannot be
rejected out of hand, such serious doubts regarding its
validity have arisen that neither can it any longer be
accepted as unreservedly as it has been hitherto.&amp;quot; (p.
214)
Rabin in his contribution is not surprised that the
sources of discourse have been found so distinctive.
Indeed, modern linguistics tends to take into account
various extra-linguistic (psycholinguistic and sociolinguis-
tic) factors that yield distinct linguistic patterns in
dialogue, narration, etc. Narrative is known to differ
from direct speech in various linguistic elements, such as
use of pronouns, verb tenses, and demonstratives. It is,
then, little wonder that Deity should use an elevated
style, full of rhetorical elements on the one hand, and
complete and complex sentences on the other, as found
in Genesis. He suggests examining the Book according
to discourse analysis techniques and the comparison of
results.
Talmon warns the reader against the spell of modern
technological aids, since another computer-aided study of
a part of Genesis by a French scholar has yielded differ-
ent results. He notes that N predominates all over the
text of Genesis, with 53% of Division III, 56% of Divi-
sion II, and 74% of Division I. H increases from 5% in
Division Ito 34% in Division II and 47% in Division III.
D, however, decreases from 21% in Division Ito 10% in
Division II and complete absence in Division III. This
internal consistency leads him to suggest that N may
have used pre-existing Canaanite or generally known
Mesopotamian material. Talmon stresses that the kind of
text analysis as applied in this book is really a literary
analysis, which fits well with modern trends of Bible
scholarship.
Belonging to the linguists&apos; part of the expected reading
public (which according to the writers includes &amp;quot;Bible
scholars, linguists, statisticians, and probably computer
people&amp;quot;), I find this book interesting to study. The start-
ing point of the documentary hypothesis is concisely and
clearly summarized. The statistical methods of each
phase are clearly described, and are illustrated by tables,
figures, and appendices. The findings appear at the end
of each statistical analysis, with a brief summary of the
results (without the numbers). It may be noted that
there is no list of references, and references to the litera-
ture appear as footnotes. Appendices are said to be four
in number, but only three exist, although &amp;quot;appendices 3
and 4&amp;quot; comprise various sub-sections. There is also a
printing mismatch of the number of counted words
between the text (p. 192) and table 4.1 (p. 193) and
exhibit 4.1 (p. 129).
The results of this study make us hope this is not the
last word on the subject (see &amp;quot;Suggestions for further
investigation and two examples&amp;quot; pp. 187-189, and
&amp;quot;Interim Postscript&amp;quot; pp. 216-217). Subsequent studies,
perhaps with more details of the linguistic features prop-
er, are to be awaited.

In this optimistically-titled book, Reichman presents a
theory of discourse processing that is intended to be the
basis for a computational module. The claim is that this
would give a full-scale natural language processing
system the capacity to generate and interpret extended
coherent discourse, rather than just short utterances.
The module would be one of the many that make up such
a system, although Reichman does not consider what
other components would be required, and how they
would interact with the discourse module.
The module would keep a dynamically-updated record
of the discourse it is engaged in, in such a way as to help
it to produce conversational moves that are relevant to
the discourse and contain correct use of pronominaliza-
tion and other discourse phenomena. Reichman provides

Book Reviews Getting Computers to Talk like You and Me
a very small part of the algorithm upon which the
program to do this might be based, although this is not
sufficient to give more than a flavour of what the archi-
tecture of that program might be.
The discourse module itself is presented as an ATN
grammar which processes detailed specification of
context spaces â€” Reichman&apos;s super-sentential unit. The
context space is an abstract structure of slots that
contains a conversational move as well as a great deal of
other information such as what the goal of the move is,
what the method of achieving that goal is, who the
speaker is, what other context space this space is partic-
ularly closely related to, and much more. This specifica-
tion is interrogated by tests in the ATN as the space is
processed, and the results are used to set registers that
form the record of the current discourse move. The ATN
produces one conversational move specification per pass,
using its register values to provide continuity between
passes, and hence continuity in the discourse structure it
specifies as output.
Reichman claims that her program is written to enable
a computer to be a conversational participant, but the
examples are simulations of entire discourses between
several participants, with the computer playing all the
parts itself. Conversation with a human participant is
assumed to be possible with &amp;quot;minor&amp;quot; adaptations, but
person-machine interaction is not actually addressed in
the model presented in the book. It is not clear that the
transformations required to get the program to act as a
conversational participant would be at all minor, since
this would require at least the addition of a &amp;quot;hearer
model&amp;quot; of the discourse, and comprehensive repair capa-
bilities for the occasions when speaker and hearer models
might disagree. The difficulties in classifying the current
conversational move would be greatly magnified if the
machine did not have access to a detailed analysis of that
move.
Perhaps the most serious problem with Reichman&apos;s
theory is the fact that she feels she has isolated rules that
apply in any sort of discourse, &amp;quot;regardless of its pnrpose
and subject matter, and regardless of the situational
context ...&amp;quot;. All Reichman&apos;s data is composed of conver-
sations between equals, on topics such as politics and
personal relationships. I applied the theory to some
question/answer data of the type that is very likely to be
encountered by just such a system as Reichman is aiming
at: I found enough difficulties with context space catego-
ries and the choices offered by the ATN to make me very
uneasy about the universality of her rules. These are not
simply problems caused by the incompleteness of the
program, which Reichman admits, but have to do with
the decomposition of data into segments for processing,
possibly meaning that this operation will have to be
changed to deal with certain types of data in ways that
would change the character of the context space. This
could have been avoided by an analysis of more informa-
tion-exchanging rather than argumentative-type data.
Another problem is the ATN itself. Firstly, the analo-
gy drawn between this model and a sentence ATN is
misleading, since it is not specified at all clearly what the
input or output is here, or how the input would be
consumed. Secondly, it seems that the ATN diagram is a
sketch of what would take place during processing, omit-
ting many details of the anatomy of the program. The
arc tests are labelled but not documented, and the nodes
themselves must conceal large portions of code. It there-
fore seems that the algorithm that would be central to the
module is not that shown in the diagram, even though its
importance is underlined by the title.
Reichman&apos;s outline definitely does not provide enough
detail to render implementation trivial. It may be that the
difficulty of mapping context space specifications from
the surface structure of utterances will be beyond the
state of the art for a long time. Another more general
problem is that if the division of labour between &amp;quot;boxes&amp;quot;
in an NLP system is not well worked-out in advance, it is
easy for certain tasks to fall down the cracks between
them. There is little attention paid to this in the book.
These considerations apart, as an abstract theory of
discourse processing Reichman&apos;s work does bring out
some important ideas, especially in the way the theory
indicates how much of the discourse context is relevant
for the processing of a given utterance. What is frustrat-
ing is that the work would be so much more useful and
easy to evaluate if the mechanism to connect the
discourse module to the surface structure of utterances
was available, or even talked about. At the moment,
applying the framework to the data manually requires so
much intuition that the point of details given at higher
levels is effectively lost. The incompleteness of the
program outline and the inadequacy of presentation of
the &amp;quot;ATN&amp;quot; are also a real hindrance:
The final three chapters of the book provide a good
overview of the theories that deal with the coherence of
discourse, and provide an idea of where Reichman
considers her theory to have its peers. Chapters 5 and 9
also include discussion of the work of Grosz (e.g., 1977)
and Sidner (1979), whose work is perhaps closest to
Reichman&apos;s own. However, it is not clear, especially in
the case of Sidner, that where Reichman points out
theoretical differences between her approach and
Sidner&apos;s, the differences are either substantial or a signif-
icant improvement.
This is the clearest summary of Reichman&apos;s work to
date, and does make the contents of her thesis (Reich-
man 1981) much more accessible. I would recommend it
to anyone wishing to get to know the research of one of
the major names in computational discourse processing,
but for those expecting to do either discourse analysis or
programming based on the book â€” approach with
caution.
