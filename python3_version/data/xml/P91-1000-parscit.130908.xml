PREFACE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.987485857142857">
This volume contains the papers prepared for the 29th Annual Meeting of the Association for
Computational Linguistics, held 18-21 June 1991 in Berkeley, California. Also, for the first time the
program included a number of presentations by students describing interesting dissertation work in
progress. Their papers are gathered in a separate section at the end of this Proceedings.
The program committee found its job to be quite difficult this year because of the extraordinarily
high quality of the submissions we received. Because of the high overall quality, we have expanded the
number of papers we accepted this year, and even so we felt that some papers were rejected that would
have met the standards of past years. It gives all of us great pleasure to see the field evolve and its
standards of excellence increase. The entire computational linguistics research community deserves
congratulations for this encouraging development. We feel this program demonstrates excellent progress
in all areas of computational linguistics, and it reflects the increasingly international character of the
research community, with contributions from Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and North America. We
hope that you find these papers as interesting and exciting as we did.
As Program Chair, I wish thank our invited speakers, Sue Atkins, Charles Fillmore, and Jun-ichi
Tsujii for their contributions to the program. I also thank Cecile Paris for organizing the tutorial sessions,
and Jaime Carbonell, Julia Hirschberg, Nancy Ide, Kathleen McCoy, Johanna Moore, and Yorick Wilks
for giving the tutorials. I also wish to extend my gratitude to Peter Norvig for the local arrangements, and
to Sandra Newton for organizing the exhibit program, and of course, to Don Walker and Betty Walker for
their tireless efforts on behalf of the ACL.
Finally, I wish to thank my fellow 1991 program committee members for their efforts in reading the
165 submitted papers: Ken Church, AT&amp;T Bell Labs and USC/IS!; Robin Cohen, University of Waterloo;

Natural Language Generation

<figureCaption confidence="0.393399909090909">
The ability to generate natural language utterances is an important component of many intelligent systems (expert systems,
intelligent tutoring systems, advice-giving systems). This tutorial will provide an in-depth survey of the branch of computational
linguistics known as natural language generation. Most of the work in natural language processing has concentrated on
understanding text. Instead, we look at the problems involved in generating text. Generation brings up issues not apparent in
understanding. The task of an understander is to recognize which choice has been taken. In contrast, a generator must decide
why to make one choice over another. Considering generation forces the researcher to come to terms with issues concerning
what kind of information must be available to the generation component, where that information may be obtained, and how
information should be presented to different users in different situations. In this tutorial we concentrate on a portion of the
generation process known as text planning, which is responsible for deciding what is to be said and how it is to be structured. We
look at how the content of a text can be chosen (including topics in user modeling and text planning formalisms) and how texts
should be structured in a coherent fashion (including topics on text structure and coherence, pragmatics, focus of attention).

Intonation in Spoken Language Systems
Julia Hirschberg, AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories
Current interest in spoken language systems has focused attention on potential interfaces between traditional concerns of
Natural Language Processing with syntactic, semantic and discourse/pragmatics representation and analysis — and traditional
</table>
<figureCaption confidence="0.475539545454545">
concerns of speech scientists and engineers with speech recognition and synthesis. One area of mutual interest is intonational
variation. How do intonational features such as phrasing and prominence interact with syntactic, semantic and discourse factors
to shape the overall &apos;meaning&apos; of an utterance? (Can parsers be designed to parse intonational features along with lexical items?
Can intonation disambiguate among possible semantic interpretations of a sentence?) How can knowledge of intonational
regularities improve speech recognition techniques and provide more natural-sounding synthetic speech? (Can intonational
information be incorporated into recognition hypotheses? Can likely intonational features be reliably predicted from text to
approximate human intonation in synthetic speech?) This tutorial will survey (a) current empirical and theoretical research on the
contribution of intonation to utterance interpretation, (b) methods of prosodic analysis from speech corpora, (c) alternative
approaches to intonational description and representation, and (d) current and potential applications to speech generation systems,
text-to-speech systems and speech recognition. The tutorial will be extensively illustrated with examples from natural and
synthetic speech.

Computational Linguistics Methodologies for Humanities Computing
Nancy M. Ide, Vassar College
Recently, panels and sessions at COLING, and conferences of the Association for Computational Linguistics, the
Association for Computers and the Humanities, and the Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing have addressed the
increasing merging of methodologies in the fields of computational linguistics and humanities computing. On the one hand,
computational linguists are devoting considerable attention to statistical and other quantitative measures traditionally used in
humanities computing. Also, work with large text corpora, long the central activity in humanities computing, is becoming an
important area for computational linguistics. Computational linguists are now beginning to consider texts, and even literary texts,
as an object of study and a rich source of information about the phenomena of language and discourse. On the other hand,
humanists are turning to methods for morphological, syntactic, and semantic analysis developed by computational linguists to
enhance their strategies for literary and linguistic studies. This tutorial will describe work which falls at the intersection of the
fields of computational linguistics and humanities computing, either in methodology or use of materials, and show how these
methods and materials benefit both disciplines. In particular, work in the areas of computational lexicology and lexicography,
corpora and corpus linguistics, statistical models and methods for language and text analysis, and content analysis will be
considered.

Machine Translation (MT) is the area of computational linguistics with the longest history and with the largest volume of
dedicated R&amp;D resources on the global scene. After reviewing the primary objectives and accomplishments of MT in its 40-year
history, the major MT paradigms will be presented in some detail, including syntactic transfer, semantic transfer, and
interlingua-based approaches. Then, we will discuss the appropriateness of these methods to different application areas,
including technical vs nontechnical text, specialized domains vs general text, multilingual vs bilingual requirements, spontaneous
discourse vs prepared text, and full-translation vs text scanning vs fact extraction. We will also touch upon evaluation of MT
systems and recent developments in MT such the re-emergence of statistical approaches, making knowledge-based interlingual
MT systems practical, and the integration of MT with other technologies such as document production, optical character
recognition, and speech understanding.

PREFACE TO THE STUDENT SESSION PAPERS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.991856260869565">
At the end of this volume are the papers accepted for short presentations at the student sessions of
the 29th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics. Unlike the main conference
sessions, where the emphasis is on completed work, the student sessions emphasize work in progress,
judged on the basis of creativity, insight, and promise.
These student sessions are an experiment that might, if successful, fulfill several desirable goals: (1)
allowing student members to hone their presentation skills in front of a group not intimately familiar with
their work; (2) providing student members with reactions to their research from the community at large,
at a point where such reactions could make a significant difference; and (3) acting as &amp;quot;ice breakers,&amp;quot;
giving student members an opportunity to meet and talk with one another and with more senior
researchers. If the student sessions have even partly fulfilled these goals, then our efforts have been
worthwhile. •
Our thanks go to all the students who submitted papers to the session and to the hard-working and
responsive members of the Student Session Committee for their efforts in planning the sessions and in
serving as reviewers: Dania Egedi, Duke University; Jong-Gyun Lim, Columbia University; Susan
McRoy, University of Toronto; Jeff Siskind, Massachusetts Institute of Technology; David Traum,
University of Rochester; and Barbara Vaut,hey, New York University and Fribourg University. We are
also grateful to the following regular ACL members, who spent hours reviewing and commenting on the
papers: Sandra Carberry, University of Delaware; Mark Liberman, University of Pennsylvania; Terry
Nutter, Virginia Polytechnic Institute; Bill Rapaport, SUNY Buffalo; Tomek Strzalkowski, New York
University; and Kent Wittenberg, Bellcore and MCC.
The student sessions would not have been possible without the initiative and support of the ACL
Executive Committee and the invaluable assistance of Marti Hearst and Peter Norvig. We owe a special
debt of thanks to Doug Appelt and Don Walker for their advice and encouragement.

<abstract confidence="0.996721454545454">The ability to generate natural language utterances is an important component of many intelligent systems (expert systems, intelligent tutoring systems, advice-giving systems). This tutorial will provide an in-depth survey of the branch of computational linguistics known as natural language generation. Most of the work in natural language processing has concentrated on understanding text. Instead, we look at the problems involved in generating text. Generation brings up issues not apparent in understanding. The task of an understander is to recognize which choice has been taken. In contrast, a generator must decide why to make one choice over another. Considering generation forces the researcher to come to terms with issues concerning what kind of information must be available to the generation component, where that information may be obtained, and how information should be presented to different users in different situations. In this tutorial we concentrate on a portion of the process known as planning, is responsible for deciding what is to be said and how it is to be structured. We look at how the content of a text can be chosen (including topics in user modeling and text planning formalisms) and how texts should be structured in a coherent fashion (including topics on text structure and coherence, pragmatics, focus of attention).</abstract>
<title confidence="0.462767">Intonation in Spoken Language Systems Hirschberg, Bell Laboratories</title>
<abstract confidence="0.976223230769231">Current interest in spoken language systems has focused attention on potential interfaces between traditional concerns of Natural Language Processing with syntactic, semantic and discourse/pragmatics representation and analysis — and traditional concerns of speech scientists and engineers with speech recognition and synthesis. One area of mutual interest is intonational variation. How do intonational features such as phrasing and prominence interact with syntactic, semantic and discourse factors to shape the overall &apos;meaning&apos; of an utterance? (Can parsers be designed to parse intonational features along with lexical items? Can intonation disambiguate among possible semantic interpretations of a sentence?) How can knowledge of intonational regularities improve speech recognition techniques and provide more natural-sounding synthetic speech? (Can intonational information be incorporated into recognition hypotheses? Can likely intonational features be reliably predicted from text to approximate human intonation in synthetic speech?) This tutorial will survey (a) current empirical and theoretical research on the contribution of intonation to utterance interpretation, (b) methods of prosodic analysis from speech corpora, (c) alternative approaches to intonational description and representation, and (d) current and potential applications to speech generation systems, text-to-speech systems and speech recognition. The tutorial will be extensively illustrated with examples from natural and synthetic speech.</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.998737545454546">increasing merging of methodologies in the fields of computational linguistics and humanities computing. On the one hand, computational linguists are devoting considerable attention to statistical and other quantitative measures traditionally used in humanities computing. Also, work with large text corpora, long the central activity in humanities computing, is becoming an important area for computational linguistics. Computational linguists are now beginning to consider texts, and even literary texts, as an object of study and a rich source of information about the phenomena of language and discourse. On the other hand, humanists are turning to methods for morphological, syntactic, and semantic analysis developed by computational linguists to enhance their strategies for literary and linguistic studies. This tutorial will describe work which falls at the intersection of the fields of computational linguistics and humanities computing, either in methodology or use of materials, and show how these methods and materials benefit both disciplines. In particular, work in the areas of computational lexicology and lexicography, corpora and corpus linguistics, statistical models and methods for language and text analysis, and content analysis will be considered.</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.926247">Machine Translation (MT) is the area of computational linguistics with the longest history and with the largest volume of on the global scene. After reviewing the primary objectives and accomplishments of MT in its 40-year history, the major MT paradigms will be presented in some detail, including syntactic transfer, semantic transfer, and interlingua-based approaches. Then, we will discuss the appropriateness of these methods to different application areas, including technical vs nontechnical text, specialized domains vs general text, multilingual vs bilingual requirements, spontaneous discourse vs prepared text, and full-translation vs text scanning vs fact extraction. We will also touch upon evaluation of MT systems and recent developments in MT such the re-emergence of statistical approaches, making knowledge-based interlingual MT systems practical, and the integration of MT with other technologies such as document production, optical character recognition, and speech understanding. ix</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.782803260869565">At the end of this volume are the papers accepted for short presentations at the student sessions of Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics. the main conference where the emphasis is on completed work, the student sessions emphasize work progress, judged on the basis of creativity, insight, and promise. These student sessions are an experiment that might, if successful, fulfill several desirable goals: (1) allowing student members to hone their presentation skills in front of a group not intimately familiar with their work; (2) providing student members with reactions to their research from the community at large, at a point where such reactions could make a significant difference; and (3) acting as &amp;quot;ice breakers,&amp;quot; giving student members an opportunity to meet and talk with one another and with more senior researchers. If the student sessions have even partly fulfilled these goals, then our efforts have been worthwhile. • Our thanks go to all the students who submitted papers to the session and to the hard-working and responsive members of the Student Session Committee for their efforts in planning the sessions and in as reviewers: Dania Egedi, University; Lim, University; of Toronto; Jeff Institute of Technology; Traum, of Rochester; Barbara Vaut,hey, York University and Fribourg University. We grateful to the following regular who spent hours reviewing and commenting on the Sandra Carberry, of Delaware; Liberman, of Pennsylvania; Polytechnic Institute; Rapaport, Buffalo; Strzalkowski, York Kent Wittenberg, and MCC. student sessions would not have been possible without the initiative and support of the Executive Committee and the invaluable assistance of Marti Hearst and Peter Norvig. We owe a special debt of thanks to Doug Appelt and Don Walker for their advice and encouragement.</abstract>
