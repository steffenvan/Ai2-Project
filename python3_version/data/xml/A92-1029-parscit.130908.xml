<bodyText confidence="0.999968807692308">
This paper describes an approach to the
treatment of nominal compounds in a ma-
chine translation project employing a modern
unification-based system.
General problems connected with the analy-
sis of compounds are briefly reviewed, and the
project, for the automatic translation of Swiss
avalanche bulletins, is introduced. Avalanche
bulletins deal with a limited semantic domain
and employ a sublanguage in which nominal
compounds occur frequently. These and other
properties of the texts affect the treatment of
compounds, permitting certain simplifications,
while leaving a number of possible alternative
analyses.
We discuss the different problems involving
the translation of compounds between German
and French, and show how the computational
environment in use permits two different ap-
proaches to the problem: an interlingua-based
approach and a transfer-based approach. Fi-
nally, we evaluate these approaches with re-
spect to linguistic and computational consider-
ations applicable in a MT-system dealing with
a limited semantic domain and describe the so-
lution that has actually been implemented.

Compound words pose well-known problems for linguis-
tic description in general, and some additional ones for
natural language processing in particular:
Identification: how can compounds be distinguished
from other words and phrases?
Segmentation: what are the components of a com-
pound? In many languages, including German, ortho-
graphic convention is such that compounds are writ-
ten as single units.&apos;
Disambiguation: what is the correct analysis of a com-
pound? On the widespread assumption that com-
pounds have a recursive binary structure, any occur-
rences with more than two basic elements will ad-

candidate must be selected.
Interpretation: how can the meaning of a compound
word be derived from the meanings of its parts? For
many purposes, there is little point in performing any
of the other tasks unless this is feasible.
It is clear that solutions to these four problems may be
closely interrelated; ill-formed interpretations may per-
mit unwanted analyses to be filtered out, the correct
analysis will constrain possible segmentations, and so
on.
In what follows, we outline an approach to the treat-
ment of compounds within a specific limited application,
the automatic translation of Swiss avalanche warning
bulletins, which exploits the nature of the texts involved
in order to translate compounds efficiently and correctly.
We first give a brief overview of the project, paying
special attention to phenomena related to compounds
and their translation. We then describe ELU,3 the soft-
ware employed for translation, and discuss a number of
the different treatments that it permits, motivating our
choice of analysis with illustrations of their weak and
strong points.

2 Compounds in Avalanche Bulletins
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999892866666667">
The avalanche bulletins are issued by IFENA (the Fed-
eral Institute for the Study of Snow and Avalanches)4 a
number of times a week during the winter season, the ex-
act frequency of their appearance depending on weather
conditions. Bulletins are prepared in German, and are
translated into the other official Swiss languages, French
and Italian, before publication. The current state of af-
fairs, in which the source language is exclusively Ger-
man, may change in future, and for this reason it has
been decided to implement a reversible system (Bouillon
and Boesefeldt, 1991a; Bouillon and Boesefeldt, 1991b).
Avalanche bulletins describe a fixed and specifiable
semantic domain, and employ a language restricted in
both vocabulary and syntactic variety. They contain a
large number of compounds, with differing grammatical

properties. It is the interpretation of compounds, to-
gether with the closely related issue of structural disam-
biguation, which most researchers have addressed (Finin,
1980; Isabelle, 1984; Sparck Jones, 1983). In an ap-
plication such as avalanche bulletin translation, how-
ever, the necessity for a deep or sophisticated analy-
sis of compound meanings is not obvious. On the one
hand, the number of compounds appearing in the sub-
language is highly restricted (approximately 400); they
may therefore be listed exhaustively, and the question
of disambiguation does not arise. And on the other,
the interpretation of a compound is given by its estab-
lished translation â€” the meaning of Lawinengefahr (&apos;dan-
ger of avalanches&apos;) is just the information necessary to
produce the required target language expression danger
d&apos;avalanches (or pericolo di valanghe, etc.).
In the current system, the main difficulty thus consists
of establishing a systematic and general relation between
single words in German and complex nominal structures
in French, without defining the semantic and pragmatic
roles of the different parts of the compound.

The &apos;head&apos; of a compound is its final constituent

-schnee, -gefahr, -zuwachs, etc.), and may itself be a com-
pound (-siidhang, for example). Constituents of a com-
pound are not inflected, although, naturally, the com-
pound as a whole may be.
There is a very strong tendency to restrict
the length of compounds to three elementary con-
stituents; of approximately 400 compound nouns in
the bulletins, issued over the past few years, only
one (Naftschneelawinengefahr: &apos;danger of wet-snow
avalanches&apos;) contains four.&apos; Complex meanings that

compound as complement (e.g. Abgang von Naftschnee-
lawinen, literally: &apos;going-down of wet-snow avalanches&apos;),
or conventional adjectival modification (e.g. sehr grosst
allgemeine Schneebrettgefahr &apos;very great general dangei

2.2 The French Translation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99988096875">
Compound nouns in the German original texts are usu-
ally translated into French as complex nominal phrase:
containing adjectival or prepositional subparts (e.g
Neuschnee: neige fraiche; Schneebrettgefahr: danger do
plaques de neige). The details of translation differ in z
number of aspects. First of all, the French phrases do not
always contain the same syntactic categories as the cor-
responding German compounds. The noun-noun com-
pound Oberficichenschicht (&apos;surface layer&apos;), for instance
is generally translated by the sequence of noun and post.
nominal adjective couches superficielles.
Secondly, prepositions within French translations o
German compounds vary from case to case: Schnee
brettgefahr is translated as danger de plaques de neige
Schneeraster as grille a neige and Lawinenforschung
recherche sur les avalanches. The use of articles withii
these PPs also varies: temperature de la neige (&apos;snom
temperature&apos;) has the definite article, while quantite
neige (&apos;snow quantity&apos;) has none. Even though the us&lt;
of the different prepositions and articles might contait
clues concerning the possible semantic and pragmatic re.
lation between the different elements of the compound!
(a denoting an instrument, an omitted article an abstraci
or partitive, etc.), the size of the corpus (only about 100(
words including nouns, verbs, articles etc.) makes it im
possible to draw any general conclusion which could bi
implemented.
Finally, certain parts of German compounds arâ– 
systematically omitted from the corresponding Fiendl
phrase: Schneebrettanrifi (&apos;rupture of a snow patch&apos;
translates as rupture de plaque, where the word neig
does not appear.

3 The treatment of compounds with
ELU
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99997325">
Since 1990, the ELU system has been used at ISSCO fo
the implementation of a machine translation system fo
Swiss avalanche warning bulletins (Boesefeldt and Bouil
Ion, 1991; Bouillon and Boesefeldt, 1991a; Bouillon am
Boesefeldt, 1991b). ELU is a unification-based gram
mar development environment in the style of PATR-I
(Shieber, 1986), designed especially for experimentatioi
with machine translation.
ELU is composed of three modules: a parser, a gen
erator and a reversible transfer module. Since it is th,
last of these that chiefly concerns us here, we shall sa:
nothing about the parser or generator. ELU support
various methods of translation. By writing grammar
that share meaning representations, one may implemen
an interlingua-based system; the result of analysing
source-language text is used directly as the basis for gen
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.988386">

<bodyText confidence="0.970525265306123">
erating the target-language text, and transfer is unneces-
sary. At the other extreme, ELU transfer rules are capa-
ble of performing arbitrary transformations on an input
structure, and thus permit whatever variety of transfer
the user desires.&apos; A transfer-based approach to transla-
tion has been selected for the current project.
Transfer rules are written which state binary relations
over the representations of texts from the source and
target languages so as to associate the analysis of one
language with the synthesis of another. There are two
kinds of transfer rule, treating atomic and complex fea-
ture structures. For example, the following two FSs, rep-
resenting the German phrase die Gefahr and its French
equivalent le danger,
[PRED gefam 1 [FRED danger I
DETYPE definite DETYPE definite
are related by means of the following four rules:
:TA: gefahr danger
:TA: definite definite
:T: pred :T: detype
:Li: &lt;* pred&gt; = X :Li: &lt;* detype&gt; = X
:L2: &lt;* pred&gt; = Y :L2: â€¹* detype&gt; = Y
:X: X = Y :X: X = Y
The transfer rules establish a relation between the
pairs of atoms gefahr â€” danger and definite â€” defi-
nite as the values of the attributes PRED and DETYPE in
the two representations. The rules pred and detype ab-
stract away from the particular values which their paths
may take; a statement of the form &amp;quot;:X: X = Y&amp;quot; indi-
cates that the success of the rule in which it appears is
conditional on the success of other rules involving what-
ever structures are bound to X and Y during the transfer
process. Transfer of a FS thus proceeds recursively, be-
ginning with the root, and, provided that no failure oc-
curs, terminating with the atoms which form the &apos;leaves&apos;
of the FS. For further details, see Estival et al. (1990)
and Russell et al. (1991).
Two broad classes of solutions suggest themselves for
the treatment of compounds in ELU: one, interlingua-
oriented (cf. Section 3.2), in which the representations in
the two languages are broadly similar, as in the Gefahr
- danger example, and the other exploiting more fully
the transfer mechanism (cf. Section 3.1). In the former
case, it is possible to pass from a German compound to
a complex French nominal phrase by employing general
transfer rules of the kind required by other aspects of
the translation task, while in the latter, different repre-
sentations are related by complex transfer rules specific
to the treatment of compounds.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999527">
3.1 The transfer-based approach
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.990031923076923">
At first view, the transfer-based approach seems to be
the more natural.
6&amp;quot;Codescription&amp;quot; analyses of the type proposed by Kaplan
et al. (1989) are also possible.
In German, compounds can be introduced in the lexi-
con as simple words and treated in the same way by the
grammar. The NP eine Schneebrettgefahr, for example,
will be represented by a feature structure similar to that
provided for the simple eine Gefahr. The semantics of
adjectival modifiers is encoded as elements in a list, since
the number of these may vary. Lists are indicated in
attribute-value diagrams by `(...)&apos; and in transfer rules
by ...] &apos;; those shown here are empty:

<bodyText confidence="0.999431411764706">
The French grammar constructs the translation of a
German compound from individual words, the head of
the phrase being lexically specified for its complement
and/or modifiers. For example, danger subcategorizes
for a PP headed by the preposition de, and contain-
ing a NP which lacks an article and whose head noun
is one of a class that includes plagues. The represen-
tation constructed for the French equivalent danger de
plagues de neige will be considerably more complex than
the German, with sub-FSs relating to the head (danger)
and complement, which itself will be a complex struc-
ture with information concerning a head (plagues) and
complement (neige). Since the prepositions in these con-
structions are determined by the lexical properties of the
nouns, they convey no information in these cases, and do
not appear in the representation; the French grammar
accounts for their correct distribution.

<bodyText confidence="0.782536857142857">
This technique makes it necessary to write a trans-
fer rule for every compound in order to pass from the
German compound to the different French words:
:T: Schneebrettgefahr
:Li: &lt;* pred&gt; = schneebrettgefahr
:L2: &lt;* args args pred&gt; = neige

<bodyText confidence="0.99991">
It presents a number of disadvantages. In the first place,
certain generalizations which we consider important can-
not be taken into account. For example, an element
may appear in a number of different compounds, and
the same information has to be repeated in each case.

<bodyText confidence="0.995931333333333">
For every compound including Gebiet (&apos;region&apos;), for ex-
ample, we have to repeat the fact that the noun Gebiet
translates as region:
</bodyText>
<table confidence="0.893308818181818">
:T: Simplongebiet
:L1: &lt;* pred&gt; = simplongebiet
:L2: &lt;* argz pred&gt; = simplon
&lt; * args detype&gt; = non
&lt; * args mod&gt; =
&lt;* pred&gt; = region
:T: Engadingebiet
:L1: &lt;* pred&gt; = engadingebiet
:L2: &lt;* args pred&gt; = engadine
&lt;* args detype&gt; = non
&lt;* args mod&gt; =
</table>
<equation confidence="0.772656">
&lt; * pred&gt; = region
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.967872">
Moreover, as this term also exists as a simple word, we
also have to add a transfer rule to translate the simple
word:
:TA: gebiet region
No account is taken of the fact that the elements in-
side the compounds correspond to isolated words and
translate in the same way; moreover, a larger number of
transfer rules is required, which, in turn, decreases the
efficiency of the system.
The use of this technique leads to an additional prob-
lem. It is possible to add an adjective to a com-
pound which already contains an adjective, e.g. ganze
Alpensiidhang (&apos;whole southern slope of the Alps&apos;). This
phrase has the following representation:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.941588">
[
PEED alpensudhang
MOD ( gang )
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.986781">
The representation of equivalent French expression tout
le versant sud des Alpes, however, is as follows:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.859577571428571">
[[

ARGS 1
DETYPE definite
MOD 0
PEED versant
MOD ( tout, sud)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999531833333333">
For the transfer between the two languages it is neces-
sary to establish a relation between the elements inside
the lists. We cannot be sure, however, that the adjective
which is a part of the German compound will always
be at the same place inside the list in French. For this
reason, it was decided to distinguish within the French
description between adjectives which compose in Ger-
man and adjectives which do not. This distinction which
might seem undesirable at first sight has been proved sat-
isfactory and generalizable for the sublanguage we treat
and could be quite easily established.
An adjective cannot be found inside a German com-
pound if it is part of a coordination, if it is modified by
an adverb, if it has a particular morphological suffix or
if it is a participle which is used adjectivally, if it has
been given a certain semantic type7 (adjectives qualify-
ing snow always compose, adjectives expressing a degree
of danger never compose), if there already is another ad-
jective inside the compound or if the compound contains
more than three elements. In all these cases it will there-
fore become the value of the path MOD : NOM and not
the value of the new path MOD : N_COMP.
The representation of the nominal phrase tout le ver-
sant sud des Alpes is then modified as follows:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.526631166666667">
PEED DETYPE definite
MOD
versant alpes I
[
[NOM
N_COMP
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.888882130434783">
The attribute MOD has thus been subdivided into two
parts, MOD : NOM for adjectives like tout that do not
compose and MOD : N_COMP for adjectives like sud that
do compose.
The transfer rules for the transfer between ganze
Alpensildhang and the French tout le versant sud des
Alpes can then be simplified and made more general:
:T: Alpensudhang
Li: &lt;* pred&gt; = alpensudhang
:L2: &lt;* args pred&gt; = alpes
&lt;a args detype&gt; = non
&lt;3k args mod&gt; = 0
&lt;a mod n_comp&gt; = sud
&lt;a pred&gt; = versant
:X:
:T: nom
:L1: &lt;a mod nom&gt; = X1
:L2: &lt;a mod nom&gt; = 12
:X: Ii = 12
:TA: ganz tout
This technique has been successfully implemented and
was the first step towards the second solution to be pre-
sented here, the interlingua-oriented solution.

In order to obtain the same representation in German
and in French, the German compounds have to be as-
signed in the lexicon a complex representation in which
the word is semantically decomposed into head and com-
plement(s). Moreover, certain information concerning
the internal structure of the French compounds has to
be added to the German representation during the anal-
ysis. This process can be done quite easily in ELU by
means of macros.8 The desired structures need only to
be defined once, the adequate values being instantiated
at the place of the variables.
&apos;Lexical items are typed according to the contexts in
which they may appear.
8ELu macros resemble a more powerful version of PATR-
II &apos;templates&apos;, permitting the use of arguments, and multiple
or recursive definitions.

The NP Alpensiidhang will thus receive the same rep-
resentation as its French equivalent:
The paths ARGS : MOD : NOM and ARGS : DETYPE in the
German representation have been added because they
are added by grammar rules constituting French NPs
and PPs.
This technique makes it possible to simplify the trans-
fer rules, which can then be used for the transfer of not
only compounds, but also other items:
:T: ncomp
:L1: &lt;* mod n_comp&gt; = X1
L2: &lt;* mod n_comp&gt; = 12

:TA: definite definite
The semantic decomposition of the German com-
pounds not only decreases the number of transfer rules,
but also makes the transfer more general and coherent,
as the different elements of a compound are translated
as simple words.
The first problem of this technique consists of deciding
what complex semantic representation to give German
compounds. The decomposition could be performed ac-
cording to the categories in either German or the target
language. A disadvantage of the former is that, for the
reasons given in section 2.2, transfer rules for irregular
cases must be added. The latter approach avoids this
difficulty by assigning the noun-noun compound Son-
nenlagen (&apos;sunny places&apos;), for example, a representation
in which the contribution of the element sonnen- and
-lage are classified as modifier and predicate respectively,
rather than predicate and argument:

But there is another reason to treat the irregulari-
ties between German and French in the German lexicon.
Two different words can also be used as synonyms in-
side and outside of a compound (e.g. Grisons is trans-
lated by Graubinden in German, but Grisons mord is
translated by Nordbiinden and not by Nordgraubiinden).
Nordbiinden has therefore been assigned a representation
suitable for the generation of the French nominal phrase,
nord des Grisons:

Moreover, this would introduce an unwanted ambigu-
ity when translating from French into German, since the
French Grisons would now be related to both Binden

Changes to lexical specifications can be made very easily
by altering the value of the relevant path in the lexicon
entry, without affecting the surface form of the lexical
item.
Similarly, certain parts of the German compound have
to be eliminated from the representation in the case of
French nominal phrases in which certain parts of the
German compound have been excluded (cf. section 2.2).
This technique, however, cannot be applied if a com-
pound without the element that is missing in French
exists in German because the same French representa-
tion would then lead to the generation of two different
nominal phrases in German.
In a number of cases the content of a compound can
also be expressed by a complex nominal phrase with
only slight stylistic differences (Fleischer, 1982: p. 20-
21). The semantic representation used for compounds,
however, is also used to express complex NPs in German;
these constructions are also translated into French nomi-
nal phrases. In constrast to the case of adjectives within
compound, which are assigned a special path in the rep-
resentation (mop : N_comP), a complex NP in German,
e.g. Abgang von Lawinen (&apos;going-down of avalanches&apos;)
will get the following representation:
lawinen
indefinite I
[NOM 0
NCOMP )
which is the same as the representation for the com-
pound Lawinenabgang, containing exactly the same in-
formation. In order to avoid over-generation resulting
from the same representation being used for two different
syntactic constructions, the possible syntactic structures
in German have been restricted.
Analysis of the corpus of avalanche bulletin texts
brought to light two types of case in which the same
representation could be obtained for a compound and
a complex NP. In the first, a fourth element either ap-
pears with a compound in a complex NP or has been
included as an element of the compound itself. As both
constructions contain exactly the same information, it
was decided to eliminate the second possibility, and al-
low no more than three elements within a compound.
For example, the word Nafischneelawinengefahr (&apos;danger
of wet snow avalanches&apos;) which is sometimes used instead
of Gefahr von Nafischneelawinen does not appear in the
lexicon, and the phrasal version is used instead.
It was also observed that, according to the degree
of lexicalisation, nouns originally derived from a verb
such as Abgang can form a part of a compound (e.g.
Neuschneeablagerung â€” &apos;deposit of wet snow&apos;) as well
as a part of a nominal phrase (e.g. Verfestigung der
Schneedecke â€” &apos;consolidation of the snow cover&apos;). As no
general syntactic rule could be found to deal with this
phenomenon it was decided to treat it on a case by case
basis according to the occurrence of derived nouns in the
avalanche bulletins.
The restrictions introduced into the German gram-
mar, which are due to general language tendencies as well
as to the language used in the avalanche bulletins, thus
make it possible to avoid over-generation for German
compounds without introducing an additional path for
complex NPs. In case of the sublanguage we are treat-
ing, semantic decomposition therefore does not compli-
cate the transfer as it is carried out according to the
requirements of the target language. If phenomena of
another language which might be added later contradict
the current decomposition, specific transfer rules can be
added to the system.

To conclude, we return to the four problems stated in
section 1:
Identification of compounds presents no problem; a
compound is listed in the lexicon just like any other
noun, except that its representation is more complex.
Segmentation of compounds is not performed; the
number and variety of compounds in the texts is suffi-
ciently restricted, and the facilities of ELU sufficiently
flexible, to make morphological analysis redundant.
Disambiguation of the structure of compounds is not
necessary, since they are not morphologically decom-
posed, and since the
Interpretation of compounds is given by their lexical
entry in combination with the transfer rules which
accept meaning representations of sentences in which
compounds appear.
In this paper we have outlined our approach to the treat-
ment of compounds in a machine translation system
dealing with the limited domain of avalanches in Switzer-
land. We have shown how we used ELU, a unification-
based linguistic environment which has been developed
for the implementation of machine translation systems
for the testing of two different approaches to the trans-
lation of compounds: a transfer-based approach and an
interlingua-oriented approach. The implementation of
the these two approaches has shown that even though
they have both proved satisfactory the interlingua ap-
proach seems more efficient and more general for the
treatment of the sublanguage because it permits a rapid
and coherent reversible transfer. The decomposition of
the German compounds which is indispensible in an in-
terlingua approach and did not complicate the system
made it possible for us to solve the problems related to
the translation of compounds which are the changing ol

<abstract confidence="0.99405482952816">This paper describes an approach to the treatment of nominal compounds in a machine translation project employing a modern unification-based system. General problems connected with the analysis of compounds are briefly reviewed, and the project, for the automatic translation of Swiss avalanche bulletins, is introduced. Avalanche bulletins deal with a limited semantic domain and employ a sublanguage in which nominal compounds occur frequently. These and other properties of the texts affect the treatment of compounds, permitting certain simplifications, while leaving a number of possible alternative analyses. We discuss the different problems involving the translation of compounds between German and French, and show how the computational environment in use permits two different approaches to the problem: an interlingua-based approach and a transfer-based approach. Finally, we evaluate these approaches with respect to linguistic and computational considerations applicable in a MT-system dealing with a limited semantic domain and describe the solution that has actually been implemented. 1 Compound Nouns Compound words pose well-known problems for linguistic description in general, and some additional ones for natural language processing in particular: Identification: how can compounds be distinguished from other words and phrases? Segmentation: what are the components of a compound? In many languages, including German, orthographic convention is such that compounds are written as single units.&apos; Disambiguation: what is the correct analysis of a compound? On the widespread assumption that compounds have a recursive binary structure, any occurwith more than two basic elements will ad- &apos;Elements of German compounds may however be separated by the so-called &amp;quot;Fugenzeichen&amp;quot; (a, en, etc.). multiple from which, normally, a single candidate must be selected. Interpretation: how can the meaning of a compound word be derived from the meanings of its parts? For many purposes, there is little point in performing any of the other tasks unless this is feasible. It is clear that solutions to these four problems may be closely interrelated; ill-formed interpretations may permit unwanted analyses to be filtered out, the correct analysis will constrain possible segmentations, and so on. In what follows, we outline an approach to the treatment of compounds within a specific limited application, the automatic translation of Swiss avalanche warning bulletins, which exploits the nature of the texts involved in order to translate compounds efficiently and correctly. We first give a brief overview of the project, paying special attention to phenomena related to compounds their translation. We then describe the software employed for translation, and discuss a number of the different treatments that it permits, motivating our choice of analysis with illustrations of their weak and strong points. 2 Compounds in Avalanche Bulletins The avalanche bulletins are issued by IFENA (the Fed- Institute for the Study of Snow and a number of times a week during the winter season, the exact frequency of their appearance depending on weather conditions. Bulletins are prepared in German, and are translated into the other official Swiss languages, French and Italian, before publication. The current state of affairs, in which the source language is exclusively German, may change in future, and for this reason it has been decided to implement a reversible system (Bouillon and Boesefeldt, 1991a; Bouillon and Boesefeldt, 1991b). Avalanche bulletins describe a fixed and specifiable semantic domain, and employ a language restricted in both vocabulary and syntactic variety. They contain a large number of compounds, with differing grammatical 2See Church and Patil (1982: p.140ff.) for discussion. Linguistique d&apos;Unification&amp;quot; (Estival, 1990). See also Johnson and Rosner (1989) for a description of the earlier UD system on which Etu is based. project is partially supported by IFENA. 209 properties. It is the interpretation of compounds, together with the closely related issue of structural disambiguation, which most researchers have addressed (Finin, 1980; Isabelle, 1984; Sparck Jones, 1983). In an application such as avalanche bulletin translation, however, the necessity for a deep or sophisticated analysis of compound meanings is not obvious. On the one hand, the number of compounds appearing in the sublanguage is highly restricted (approximately 400); they may therefore be listed exhaustively, and the question of disambiguation does not arise. And on the other, the interpretation of a compound is given by its estabtranslation â€” the meaning of (&apos;danger of avalanches&apos;) is just the information necessary to the required target language expression di valanghe, In the current system, the main difficulty thus consists of establishing a systematic and general relation between single words in German and complex nominal structures in French, without defining the semantic and pragmatic roles of the different parts of the compound. 2.1 Variation in German Compounds A purely categorial analysis of the German compound nouns contained in the avalanche warning bulletins reveals the following internal combinations of nouns, adjectives, verbs and prepositions: N] &apos;new snow&apos; N] &apos;danger of avalanches&apos; N] &apos;floating snow&apos; [ADJ N]] &apos;southern slope of the Alps&apos; N] N] &apos;increase in new snow&apos; N] N] Schwimmschneebildung &apos;development of floating snow&apos; N] N] &apos;danger of snow patches&apos; N] N] &apos;explosion above the snow&apos; The &apos;head&apos; of a compound is its final constituent which determines its properties (in the examples above, -gefahr, -zuwachs, and may itself be a comexample). Constituents of a compound are not inflected, although, naturally, the compound as a whole may be. There is a very strong tendency to restrict the length of compounds to three elementary constituents; of approximately 400 compound nouns in the bulletins, issued over the past few years, only of wet-snow avalanches&apos;) contains four.&apos; Complex meanings that distribution can also be found in other domains (Boesefeldt, 1989) as well as in general language (Fleischer, 1982). might be expressed by a fourth element within a compound generally occur in the form of a noun taking the as complement (e.g. von Naftschnee- &apos;going-down of wet-snow avalanches&apos;), conventional adjectival modification (e.g. grosst Schneebrettgefahr great general dangei of snow patches&apos;). 2.2 The French Translation Compound nouns in the German original texts are usually translated into French as complex nominal phrase: containing adjectival or prepositional subparts (e.g Neuschnee: neige fraiche; Schneebrettgefahr: danger do de neige). details of translation differ in z number of aspects. First of all, the French phrases do not always contain the same syntactic categories as the corresponding German compounds. The noun-noun comlayer&apos;), for instance is generally translated by the sequence of noun and post. adjective superficielles. Secondly, prepositions within French translations o compounds vary from case to Schnee translated as de plaques de neige sur les avalanches. use of articles withii PPs also varies: de la neige has the definite article, while quantity&apos;) has none. Even though the us&lt; of the different prepositions and articles might contait clues concerning the possible semantic and pragmatic re. lation between the different elements of the compound! (a denoting an instrument, an omitted article an abstraci or partitive, etc.), the size of the corpus (only about 100( words including nouns, verbs, articles etc.) makes it im possible to draw any general conclusion which could bi implemented. Finally, certain parts of German compounds arâ–  systematically omitted from the corresponding Fiendl of a snow patch&apos; as rupture plaque, the word does not appear. 3 The treatment of compounds with ELU Since 1990, the ELU system has been used at ISSCO fo the implementation of a machine translation system fo Swiss avalanche warning bulletins (Boesefeldt and Bouil Ion, 1991; Bouillon and Boesefeldt, 1991a; Bouillon am Boesefeldt, 1991b). ELU is a unification-based gram mar development environment in the style of PATR-I (Shieber, 1986), designed especially for experimentatioi with machine translation. ELU is composed of three modules: a parser, a gen and a reversible transfer module. Since it is last of these that chiefly concerns us here, we shall sa: nothing about the parser or generator. ELU support various methods of translation. By writing grammar that share meaning representations, one may implemen an interlingua-based system; the result of analysing source-language text is used directly as the basis for gen 210 erating the target-language text, and transfer is unnecessary. At the other extreme, ELU transfer rules are capable of performing arbitrary transformations on an input structure, and thus permit whatever variety of transfer the user desires.&apos; A transfer-based approach to translation has been selected for the current project. Transfer rules are written which state binary relations over the representations of texts from the source and target languages so as to associate the analysis of one language with the synthesis of another. There are two kinds of transfer rule, treating atomic and complex feature structures. For example, the following two FSs, repthe German phrase Gefahr its French danger, 1 I definite are related by means of the following four rules: :TA: gefahr danger :TA: definite definite :T: pred :T: detype :Li: &lt;* pred&gt; = X :Li: &lt;* detype&gt; = X &lt;* = Y :L2: â€¹* detype&gt; = Y :X: X = Y :X: X = Y The transfer rules establish a relation between the of atoms â€” danger â€” defithe values of the attributes two representations. The rules abstract away from the particular values which their paths take; a statement of the form X = indicates that the success of the rule in which it appears is conditional on the success of other rules involving whatstructures are bound to the transfer process. Transfer of a FS thus proceeds recursively, beginning with the root, and, provided that no failure occurs, terminating with the atoms which form the &apos;leaves&apos; of the FS. For further details, see Estival et al. (1990) and Russell et al. (1991). Two broad classes of solutions suggest themselves for treatment of compounds in ELU: one, interlinguaoriented (cf. Section 3.2), in which the representations in two languages are broadly similar, as in the danger and the other exploiting more fully the transfer mechanism (cf. Section 3.1). In the former case, it is possible to pass from a German compound to a complex French nominal phrase by employing general transfer rules of the kind required by other aspects of the translation task, while in the latter, different representations are related by complex transfer rules specific to the treatment of compounds. 3.1 The transfer-based approach At first view, the transfer-based approach seems to be the more natural. analyses of type proposed by Kaplan et al. (1989) are also possible. In German, compounds can be introduced in the lexicon as simple words and treated in the same way by the The NP Schneebrettgefahr, example, will be represented by a feature structure similar to that for the simple Gefahr. semantics of adjectival modifiers is encoded as elements in a list, since the number of these may vary. Lists are indicated in attribute-value diagrams by `(...)&apos; and in transfer rules &apos;; shown here are empty: schneebrettgefahr gefahr [FRED DETYPE indefinite [FRED DETYPE indefinite MOD ) MOD ) The French grammar constructs the translation of a German compound from individual words, the head of the phrase being lexically specified for its complement modifiers. For example, a PP headed by the preposition containing a NP which lacks an article and whose head noun one of a class that includes represenconstructed for the French equivalent de de neige be considerably more complex than German, with sub-FSs relating to the head and complement, which itself will be a complex strucwith information concerning a head the prepositions in these constructions are determined by the lexical properties of the nouns, they convey no information in these cases, and do not appear in the representation; the French grammar accounts for their correct distribution. [[FRED ARGS DETYPE MOD ) danger MOD ) This technique makes it necessary to write a transfer rule for every compound in order to pass from the German compound to the different French words: :T: Schneebrettgefahr :Li: &lt;* pred&gt; = schneebrettgefahr :L2: &lt;* args args pred&gt; = neige &lt;* args args detype&gt; = non args nod&gt; = pred&gt; = plaques &lt;* args detype&gt; = non mod&gt; = 0 = danger :X: It presents a number of disadvantages. In the first place, certain generalizations which we consider important cannot be taken into account. For example, an element may appear in a number of different compounds, and the same information has to be repeated in each case. ARGS FRED neige non 211 every compound including for exwe have to repeat the fact that the noun as :L1: &lt;* pred&gt; = simplongebiet :L2: &lt;* argz pred&gt; = simplon detype&gt; = non mod&gt; = &lt;* pred&gt; = region :T: Engadingebiet :L1: &lt;* pred&gt; = engadingebiet :L2: &lt;* args pred&gt; = engadine &lt;* args detype&gt; = non &lt;* args mod&gt; = = region Moreover, as this term also exists as a simple word, we also have to add a transfer rule to translate the simple word: :TA: gebiet region No account is taken of the fact that the elements inside the compounds correspond to isolated words and translate in the same way; moreover, a larger number of transfer rules is required, which, in turn, decreases the efficiency of the system. The use of this technique leads to an additional problem. It is possible to add an adjective to a comwhich already contains an adjective, e.g. southern slope of the Alps&apos;). This phrase has the following representation: [ ( ) The representation of equivalent French expression tout versant sud des Alpes, is as follows: [[ MOD 0 ( sud) For the transfer between the two languages it is necessary to establish a relation between the elements inside the lists. We cannot be sure, however, that the adjective which is a part of the German compound will always be at the same place inside the list in French. For this reason, it was decided to distinguish within the French description between adjectives which compose in German and adjectives which do not. This distinction which might seem undesirable at first sight has been proved satisfactory and generalizable for the sublanguage we treat and could be quite easily established. An adjective cannot be found inside a German compound if it is part of a coordination, if it is modified by an adverb, if it has a particular morphological suffix or if it is a participle which is used adjectivally, if it has given a certain semantic (adjectives qualifying snow always compose, adjectives expressing a degree of danger never compose), if there already is another adjective inside the compound or if the compound contains more than three elements. In all these cases it will therebecome the value of the path : NOM not value of the new path : N_COMP. representation of the nominal phrase le versud des Alpes is modified as follows: DETYPE MOD I [ [NOM N_COMP attribute thus been subdivided into two : NOM adjectives like tout that do not and : N_COMP adjectives like do compose. transfer rules for the transfer between the French le versant sud des then be simplified and made more general: pred&gt; = alpensudhang args pred&gt; = alpes &lt;a args detype&gt; = non &lt;3k args mod&gt; = 0 &lt;a mod n_comp&gt; = sud &lt;a pred&gt; = versant :X: :T: nom :L1: &lt;a mod nom&gt; = X1 :L2: &lt;a mod nom&gt; = 12 :X: Ii = 12 :TA: ganz tout This technique has been successfully implemented and was the first step towards the second solution to be presented here, the interlingua-oriented solution. 3.2 An interlingua-oriented approach In order to obtain the same representation in German and in French, the German compounds have to be assigned in the lexicon a complex representation in which the word is semantically decomposed into head and complement(s). Moreover, certain information concerning the internal structure of the French compounds has to be added to the German representation during the analysis. This process can be done quite easily in ELU by of The desired structures need only to be defined once, the adequate values being instantiated at the place of the variables. are typed according to the contexts in which they may appear. macros resemble a more powerful version of PATR- II &apos;templates&apos;, permitting the use of arguments, and multiple or recursive definitions. ARGS PEED MOD 0 212 NP thus receive the same representation as its French equivalent: paths : MOD : NOM and ARGS : DETYPE the German representation have been added because they are added by grammar rules constituting French NPs and PPs. This technique makes it possible to simplify the transfer rules, which can then be used for the transfer of not only compounds, but also other items: :T: ncomp mod n_comp&gt; = X1 mod n_comp&gt; = 12 = X2 :T: nom &lt;* mod nom&gt; = :L2: &lt;* mod nom&gt; = 12 :X: Ii= 12 :T: pred :L1: &lt;* pred&gt; = X1 :L2: &lt;* pred&gt; = 12 :X: X1 = X2 :T: args :L1: &lt;* args&gt; = X1 :L2: &lt;* args&gt; = 12 :X: X1 = 12 :T: detype :L1: &lt;* detype&gt; = X1 :L2: &lt;* detype&gt; = 12 :X: X1 = 12 :TA: alpen alpes :TA: hang versant :TA: and and :TA: definite definite The semantic decomposition of the German compounds not only decreases the number of transfer rules, also makes the general and coherent, as the different elements of a compound are translated as simple words. The first problem of this technique consists of deciding what complex semantic representation to give German compounds. The decomposition could be performed according to the categories in either German or the target language. A disadvantage of the former is that, for the reasons given in section 2.2, transfer rules for irregular cases must be added. The latter approach avoids this by assigning the noun-noun compound Sonplaces&apos;), for example, a representation which the contribution of the element classified as modifier and predicate respectively, rather than predicate and argument: [ PRED MOD This representation corresponds to the representation for French equivalent, ensoleille: ensoleille )1 I not the value of the path : this representation does not interfere with the representation the possible nominal phrase Lage: â€¢ PRED NOM ( ) 1 MOD N_COMP is another reason to treat the irregularities between German and French in the German lexicon.

Similarly, certain parts of the German compound have to be eliminated from the representation in the case of French nominal phrases in which certain parts of the German compound have been excluded (cf. section 2.2). This technique, however, cannot be applied if a compound without the element that is missing in French exists in German because the same French representation would then lead to the generation of two different nominal phrases in German. In a number of cases the content of a compound can also be expressed by a complex nominal phrase with only slight stylistic differences (Fleischer, 1982: p. 20- 21). The semantic representation used for compounds, however, is also used to express complex NPs in German; these constructions are also translated into French nominal phrases. In constrast to the case of adjectives within compound, which are assigned a special path in the representation (mop : N_comP), a complex NP in German, von Lawinen of avalanches&apos;) will get the following representation: lawinen indefinite I [NOM 0 NCOMP ) which is the same as the representation for the comexactly the same information. In order to avoid over-generation resulting from the same representation being used for two different syntactic constructions, the possible syntactic structures in German have been restricted. Analysis of the corpus of avalanche bulletin texts brought to light two types of case in which the same representation could be obtained for a compound and a complex NP. In the first, a fourth element either appears with a compound in a complex NP or has been included as an element of the compound itself. As both constructions contain exactly the same information, it was decided to eliminate the second possibility, and allow no more than three elements within a compound. example, the word of wet snow avalanches&apos;) which is sometimes used instead von Nafischneelawinen not appear in the lexicon, and the phrasal version is used instead. It was also observed that, according to the degree of lexicalisation, nouns originally derived from a verb as form a part of a compound (e.g. â€” of wet snow&apos;) as well a part of a nominal phrase (e.g. der â€” of the snow cover&apos;). As no general syntactic rule could be found to deal with this phenomenon it was decided to treat it on a case by case basis according to the occurrence of derived nouns in the avalanche bulletins. The restrictions introduced into the German grammar, which are due to general language tendencies as well as to the language used in the avalanche bulletins, thus make it possible to avoid over-generation for German compounds without introducing an additional path for complex NPs. In case of the sublanguage we are treating, semantic decomposition therefore does not complicate the transfer as it is carried out according to the requirements of the target language. If phenomena of another language which might be added later contradict the current decomposition, specific transfer rules can be added to the system. 4 Conclusion To conclude, we return to the four problems stated in section 1: compounds presents no problem; a compound is listed in the lexicon just like any other noun, except that its representation is more complex. compounds is not performed; the number and variety of compounds in the texts is sufficiently restricted, and the facilities of ELU sufficiently flexible, to make morphological analysis redundant. the structure of compounds is not necessary, since they are not morphologically decomposed, and since the compounds is given by their lexical entry in combination with the transfer rules which accept meaning representations of sentences in which compounds appear. In this paper we have outlined our approach to the treatment of compounds in a machine translation system dealing with the limited domain of avalanches in Switzerland. We have shown how we used ELU, a unificationbased linguistic environment which has been developed for the implementation of machine translation systems for the testing of two different approaches to the translation of compounds: a transfer-based approach and an interlingua-oriented approach. The implementation of the these two approaches has shown that even though they have both proved satisfactory the interlingua approach seems more efficient and more general for the treatment of the sublanguage because it permits a rapid and coherent reversible transfer. The decomposition of the German compounds which is indispensible in an interlingua approach and did not complicate the system made it possible for us to solve the problems related to the translation of compounds which are the changing ol [ ARGS PEED [FRED DETYPE MOD abgang 214 categories, the use of synonymy and the removal or addition of certain elements in the target language.</abstract>

The rules pred and detype abstract away from the particular values which their paths may take; a statement of the form &amp;quot;:X: X = Y&amp;quot; indicates that the success of the rule in which it appears is conditional on the success of other rules involving whatever structures are bound to X and Y during the transfer process. Transfer of a FS thus proceeds recursively, beginning with the root, and, provided that no failure occurs, terminating with the atoms which form the &apos;leaves&apos; of the FS. For further details, see Estival et al. (1990) and Russell et al. (1991). Two broad classes of solutions suggest themselves for the treatment of compounds in ELU: one, interlinguaoriented (cf. Section 3.2), in which the representations in the two languages are broadly similar, as in the Gefahr - danger example, and the other exploiting more fully the transfer mechanism (cf. Section 3.1). In the former case, it is possible to pass from a German compound to a complex French nominal phrase by employing general transfer rules of the kind required by other aspects of the translation task, while in the latter, different representations are rela</context>

Constituents of a compound are not inflected, although, naturally, the compound as a whole may be.

Similarly, certain parts of the German compound have to be eliminated from the representation in the case of French nominal phrases in which certain parts of the German compound have been excluded (cf. section 2.2). This technique, however, cannot be applied if a compound without the element that is missing in French exists in German because the same French representation would then lead to the generation of two different nominal phrases in German. In a number of cases the content of a compound can also be expressed by a complex nominal phrase with only slight stylistic differences (Fleischer, 1982: p. 20- 21). The semantic representation used for compounds, however, is also used to express complex NPs in German; these constructions are also translated into French nominal phrases. In constrast to the case of adjectives within compound, which are assigned a special path in the representation (mop : N_comP), a complex NP in German, e.g. Abgang von Lawinen (&apos;going-down of avalanches&apos;) will get the following representation: lawinen indefinite I [NOM 0 NCOMP ) which is the same as the representation for the compound Lawinenabgang, containing exactly the same information.

It is the interpretation of compounds, together with the closely related issue of structural disambiguation, which most researchers have addressed (Finin, 1980; Isabelle, 1984; Sparck Jones, 1983). In an application such as avalanche bulletin translation, however, the necessity for a deep or sophisticated analysis of compound meanings is not obvious. On the one hand, the number of compounds appearing in the sublanguage is highly restricted (approximately 400); they m</context>

In the former case, it is possible to pass from a German compound to a complex French nominal phrase by employing general transfer rules of the kind required by other aspects of the translation task, while in the latter, different representations are related by complex transfer rules specific to the treatment of compounds. 3.1 The transfer-based approach At first view, the transfer-based approach seems to be the more natural. 6&amp;quot;Codescription&amp;quot; analyses of the type proposed by Kaplan et al. (1989) are also possible. In German, compounds can be introduced in the lexicon as simple words and treated in the same way by the grammar. The NP eine Schneebrettgefahr, for example, will be represented by a feature structure similar to that provided for the simple eine Gefahr. The semantics of adjectival modifiers is encoded as elements in a list, since the number of these may vary. Lists are indicated in attribute-value diagrams by `(...)&apos; and in transfer rules by ...] &apos;; those shown here are empty: schneebrettgefahr gefahr [FRED indefinite [FRED indefinite DETYPE DETYPE MOD ) MOD ) The French gr</context>

The rules pred and detype abstract away from the particular values which their paths may take; a statement of the form &amp;quot;:X: X = Y&amp;quot; indicates that the success of the rule in which it appears is conditional on the success of other rules involving whatever structures are bound to X and Y during the transfer process. Transfer of a FS thus proceeds recursively, beginning with the root, and, provided that no failure occurs, terminating with the atoms which form the &apos;leaves&apos; of the FS. For further details, see Estival et al. (1990) and Russell et al. (1991). Two broad classes of solutions suggest themselves for the treatment of compounds in ELU: one, interlinguaoriented (cf. Section 3.2), in which the representations in the two languages are broadly similar, as in the Gefahr - danger example, and the other exploiting more fully the transfer mechanism (cf. Section 3.1). In the former case, it is possible to pass from a German compound to a complex French nominal phrase by employing general transfer rules of the kind required by other aspects of the translation task, while in the latter, different representations are related by complex transfer ru</context>

ELU is a unification-based gram mar development environment in the style of PATR-I (Shieber, 1986), designed especially for experimentatioi with machine translation. ELU is composed of three modules: a parser, a gen erator and a reversible transfer module. Since it is th, last of these that chiefly concerns us here, we shall sa: nothing about the parser or generator. ELU support various methods of translation. By writing grammar that share meaning representations, one may implemen an interlingua-based system; the result of analysing source-language text is used directly as the basis for gen 210 erating the target-language text, and transfer is unnecessary. At the other extreme, ELU transfe</context>
