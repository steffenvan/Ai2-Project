Most of the previous works that disam-
biguate personal names in Web search re-
sults employ agglomerative clustering ap-
proaches. However, these approaches tend
to generate clusters that contain a single el-
ement depending on a certain criterion of
merging similar clusters. In contrast to such
previous works, we have adopted a semi-
supervised clustering approach to integrate
similar documents into a labeled document.
Moreover, our proposed approach is char-
acterized by controlling the fluctuation of
the centroid of a cluster in order to generate
more accurate clusters.

Personal names are often submitted to search en-
gines as query keywords, as described in a report1
indicating that about 10% of the English queries
from the search engine ALLTheWeb2 contain per-
sonal names. However, in response to a personal
name query, search engines return a long list of
search results containing that contains Web pages
about several namesakes. For example, when a
user submits a personal name like “William Cohen”
as a query to the search engine Google3, the re-
turned results represent more than one person named
“William Cohen.” In the results, a computer sci-
ence professor, an American politician, a surgeon,

and others are not classified into separate clusters
but mixed together.
Most of the previous works on disambiguating
personal names in Web search results employ sev-
eral kinds of agglomerative clustering approach as
described in Section 2. However, in these ap-
proaches, a lot of clusters that contain only one el-
ement tend to be generated, depending on a certain
criterion for merging similar clusters. In addition,
in person search results from the World Wide Web
(WWW), we can often observe that a small num-
ber of entities have a lot of search-result Web pages,
while others have only one or two. In light of these
facts, if a labeled Web page that describes a person
is introduced, clustering for personal name disam-
biguation would be much more accurate. In the fol-
lowing, we refer to such a labeled Web page as the
“seed page.” Then, in order to disambiguate per-
sonal names in Web search results, we introduce
semi-supervised clustering that uses the seed page
to aid the clustering of unlabeled search-result Web
pages. Our semi-supervised clustering approach is
characterized by controlling the fluctuation of the
centroid of a cluster.

an approach similar to that of (Mann and Yarowsky,
2003), and have developed a system called Web-
Hawk.
(Pedersen et al., 2005) recently proposed a
method for discriminating names by clustering the
instances of a given name into groups. They ex-
tract the context of each instance of an ambiguous
name and generate second-order context vectors us-
ing significant bigrams. The vectors are then clus-
tered such that instances that are similar to each
other are grouped into the same cluster.
(Bekkerman and McCallum, 2005) propose the
following three unsupervised approaches: (1) an
approach based on the hyperlink structures of
Web pages; (2) an approach based on agglomera-
tive/conglomerative double clustering (Bekkerman
et al., 2005); and (3) a hybrid approach combining
the first two.
(Bollegala et al., 2006) first agglomeratively clus-
ter a set of documents and then select key phrases
from the resulting clusters to distinguish different
namesakes. They extract key phrases from the doc-
uments and merge the clusters according to the sim-
ilarity between the extracted phrases.

(Papineni, 2001) is the most effective term weight-
ing scheme for generating feature vectors for clus-
tering in this kind of task. Using the gain scheme,

page is an individual cluster, and then two clusters
with the largest similarity are iteratively merged to
generate a new cluster until this similarity is less
than a predefined threshold. The detailed algorithm

that it controls the fluctuation of the centroid of a

process, when we merge the feature vector of
a search-result Web page into a particular centroid

we employ the Mahalanobis distance (Hand et al.,

Tables 2 and 3 show evaluation results in each doc-
ument set obtained using pure agglomerative clus-
tering and our proposed semi-supervised clustering,
respectively. “Set 1,” “Set 2,” and “Set 3” con-
tain the names from participants in the ACL con-
ference, from biographical articles in the English
Wikipedia, and from the US Census, respectively.
According to these tables, we found that, although
agglomerative clustering outperforms our proposed
semi-supervised clustering by 0.21 in the value of
purity, our proposed semi-supervised clustering out-
performs agglomerative clustering by 0.4 and 0.06
in the values of inverse purity and F-measure, re-
spectively. This indicates that our proposed method
tends to integrate search-result Web pages into a
seed page and a small number of clusters are gen-
erated compared with agglomerative clustering. In
terms of these facts, it is easier for a user to browse
Web pages clustered based on each personal entity.
On the other hand, the small values of purity indi-
cate that irrelevant search-result Web pages are of-
ten contained in the generated clusters. Therefore,
we can guess that irrelevant search-result Web pages
are integrated into a seed page. In fact, we observed
that more than 50 search-result Web pages could be
grouped together with a seed page.

articles are continuously updated, the reliability of
Wikipedia as a source of seed pages will be promis-

each person in detail, we found that the purity values
are improved when we use a seed page that describes
the person using more than about 200 words. On the

a person with less than 150 words, or describes not
only the target person but also some other persons,
we could not obtain high purity values.

In this paper, we described our participating system
in the SemEval-2007 Web People Search Task (Ar-
tiles et al., 2007). Our system used a semi-
supervised clustering which controls the fluctuation
of the centroid of a cluster. The evaluation results
showed that our proposed method achieves high
scores in inverse purity, with the lower scores in pu-
rity. This fact indicates that our proposed method
tends to integrate search-result Web pages into a
seed page. This clustering result makes it easier
for a user to browse the results of a person Web
search. However, in the generated cluster with a
seed page, irrelevant search-result Web pages are
also contained. This problem can be solved by in-

we used the full contents of search-result Web pages

plan to conduct further experiments by introducing
multiple seed pages and using parts of search-result
Web pages and seed pages such as words around an

They extract the context of each instance of an ambiguous name and generate second-order context vectors using significant bigrams. The vectors are then clustered such that instances that are similar to each other are grouped into the same cluster. (Bekkerman and McCallum, 2005) propose the following three unsupervised approaches: (1) an approach based on the hyperlink structures of Web pages; (2) an approach based on agglomerative/conglomerative double clustering (Bekkerman et al., 2005); and (3) a hybrid approach combining the first two. (Bollegala et al., 2006) first agglomeratively cluster a set of documents and then select key phrases from the resulting clusters to distinguish different namesakes. They extract key phrases from the documents and merge the clusters according to the similarity between the extracted phrases. 3 Our Proposed Approach In this section, we first review the pure agglomerative clustering approach that most of the previous related works employ and then describe our proposed semi-supervised clustering approach.

In light of these facts, if a labeled Web page that describes a person is introduced, clustering for personal name disambiguation would be much more accurate. In the following, we refer to such a labeled Web page as the “seed page.” Then, in order to disambiguate personal names in Web search results, we introduce semi-supervised clustering that uses the seed page to aid the clustering of unlabeled search-result Web pages. Our semi-supervised clustering approach is characterized by controlling the fluctuation of the centroid of a cluster. 2 Related Work (Mann and Yarowsky, 2003) first extract biographical information, such as birthdates, birthplaces, occupations, and so on. Then, for each document, they generate a feature vector composed of the extracted biographical information, proper nouns, and the TF-IDF score computed from the documents in the search results. Finally, using this feature vector, they disambiguate personal names by generating clusters based on a bottom-up centroid agglomera318 Proceedings of the 4th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluations (SemEval-2007), pages 318–321, Prague, June 2007. c�2007 Association for Computational Linguistics Algo</context>

In the following discussion, we denote the feature vector of a search-result Web page in a set of search results as follows: (1) where is the number of distinct terms in the Web page, and denotes each term. Stop words were eliminated from all Web pages in the search results based on the stopword list4, and stemming was performed using Porter stemmer5. In our preliminary experiments, we found that gain (Papineni, 2001) is the most effective term weighting scheme for generating feature vectors for clustering in this kind of task. Using the gain scheme, we also define each element of as follows: 4ftp://ftp.cs.cornell.edu/pub/smart/english.stop 5http://www.tartarus.org/˜martin/PorterStemmer/ Figure 1: Agglomerative clustering algorithm. where is the document frequency of term , and is the total number of search-result Web pages.
