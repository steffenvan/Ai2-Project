Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.9997418125">
Speech-based interfaces have great potential
but are hampered by problems related to spo-
ken language such as variability, noise and
ambiguity. Speech Graffiti was designed to
address these issues via a structured, universal
interface protocol for interacting with simple
machines. Since Speech Graffiti requires that
users speak to the system in a certain way, we
were interested in how users might respond to
such a system when compared with a natural
language system. We conducted a user study
and found that 74% of users preferred the
Speech Graffiti system to a natural language
interface in the same domain. User satisfac-
tion scores were higher for Speech Graffiti
and task completion rates were roughly equal.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9993981875">
Many problems still exist in the design of speech-based
interfaces. Noisy environments and linguistic variability
make interpretation of already uncertain input even
more difficult, resulting in errors that must be handled
effectively. What if many of these issues could be re-
duced by asking users to interact with speech-based
systems in a structured way? Would they learn the in-
teraction protocol? Would they prefer a more efficient
yet structured interaction to one that was more natural,
but perhaps less efficient?
One approach to structuring interaction is through
directed-dialog systems. These generally work well for
novice users, but they can be too meandering for expert
users who know exactly what they want from the sys-
tem. Specialized command-and-control languages give
more power to the user, but they can be difficult for
novices and require learning a new language for each
new application encountered.
Speech Graffiti is a structured interaction protocol
that is designed to be universal. Common input struc-
tures, output patterns and keywords are used for all
Speech Graffiti applications, and once users are familiar
with these for any single application, they can navigate
their way through any other Speech Graffiti application.

User interactions with Speech Graffiti (independent
of other speech interfaces) have previously been as-
sessed in Rosenfeld et al. (2000). Here we consider a
head-to-head comparison: given the chance to interact
with both types of interfaces, which would people
choose? What differences might be observed in per-
formance or user satisfaction?

Although much research has been conducted on the
design of natural language spoken dialog systems, far
less research has been done on more standardized
speech interfaces. Several studies have previously found
that users are able to interact successfully using
constrained or subset languages (e.g. Guindon &amp;
Shuldberg, 1987; Ringle &amp; Halstead-Nussloch, 1989;
Sidner &amp; Forlines, 2002). As far as we know, no studies
have been done comparing constrained, “universal”
languages and natural language interfaces directly as we
have done in this study. General information about the
Speech Graffiti project and its motivation can be found
in Rosenfeld et al. (2001).

2 Method

<bodyText confidence="0.999808285714286">
We conducted a within-subjects user study in which
participants attempted a series of queries to a movie
information database with either a Speech Graffiti inter-
face (SG-ML) or a natural language interface (NL-ML).
Participants repeated the process with the other system
after completing their initial tasks and an evaluation
questionnaire. System presentation order was balanced.

<bodyText confidence="0.9999891">
Twenty-three users (12 female, 11 male) accessed the
systems via telephone in our lab. Most were under-
graduate students from Carnegie Mellon University,
resulting in a limited range of ages represented. None
had any prior experience with either of the two movie
systems or interfaces, and all users were native speakers
of American English. About half the users had computer
science and/or engineering (CSE) backgrounds, and
similarly about half reported that they did computer
programming “fairly often” or “very frequently.”
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997386">
2.2 Training
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999975913043478">
Users learned Speech Graffiti concepts prior to use dur-
ing a brief, self-paced, web-based tutorial session.
Speech Graffiti training sessions were balanced between
tutorials using examples from the MovieLine and tutori-
als using examples from a database that provided simu-
lated flight arrival, departure, and gate information.
Regardless of training domain, most users spent ten to
fifteen minutes on the Speech Graffiti tutorial.
A side effect of the Speech Graffiti-specific training
is that in addition to teaching users the concepts of the
language, it also familiarizes users with the more gen-
eral task of speaking to a computer over the phone. To
balance this effect for users of the natural language sys-
tem, which is otherwise intended to be a walk-up-and-
use interface, participants engaged in a brief NL “fa-
miliarization session” in which they were simply in-
structed to call the system and try it out. To match the
in-domain/out-of-domain variable used in the SG tutori-
als, half of the NL familiarization sessions used the NL
MovieLine and half used MIT’s Jupiter natural lan-
guage weather information system (Zue et al., 2000).
Users typically spent about five minutes exploring the
NL systems during the familiarization session.

2.3 Tasks

<bodyText confidence="0.999896">
After having completed the training session for a spe-
cific system, each user was asked to call that system and
attempt a set of tasks (e.g. “list what’s playing at the
Squirrel Hill Theater,” “find out &amp; write down what the
ratings are for the movies showing at the Oaks Thea-
ter”). Participant compensation included task comple-
tion bonuses to encourage users to attempt each task in
earnest. Regardless of which system they were working
with, all users were given the same eight tasks for their
first interactions and a different set of eight tasks for
their second system interactions.

2.4 Evaluation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999944684210527">
After interacting with a system, each participant was
asked to complete a user satisfaction questionnaire scor-
ing 34 subjective-response items on a 7-point Likert
scale. This questionnaire was based on the Subjective
Assessment of Speech System Interfaces (SASSI) pro-
ject (Hone &amp; Graham, 2001), which sorts a number of
subjective user satisfaction statements (such as “I al-
ways knew what to say to the system” and “the system
makes few errors”) into six relevant factors: system
response accuracy, habitability, cognitive demand, an-
noyance, likeability and speed. User satisfaction scores
were calculated for each factor and overall by averaging
the responses to the appropriate component statements.1
In addition to the Likert scale items, users were also
asked a few comparison questions, such as “which of
the two systems did you prefer?”
For objective comparison of the two interfaces, we
measured overall task completion, time- and turns-to-
completion, and word- and understanding-error rates.

3.1 Subjective assessments
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999796789473684">
Seventeen out of 23 participants preferred Speech Graf-
fiti to the natural language interface. User assessments
were significantly higher for Speech Graffiti overall and
for each of the six subjective factors, as shown in Fig. 2
(REML analysis: system response accuracy F=13.8,
p&lt;0.01; likeability F=6.8, p&lt;0.02; cognitive demand
F=5.7, p&lt;0.03; annoyance F=4.3, p&lt;0.05; habitability
F=7.7, p&lt;0.02; speed F=34.7, p&lt;0.01; overall F=11.2,
p&lt;0.01). All of the mean SG-ML scores except for an-
noyance and habitability are positive (i.e. &gt; 4), while the
NL-ML did not generate positive mean ratings in any
category. For individual users, all those and only those
who stated they preferred the NL-ML to the SG-ML
gave the NL-ML higher overall subjective ratings.
Although users with CSE/programming back-
grounds tended to give the SG-ML higher user satisfac-
tion ratings than non-CSE/programming participants,
the differences were not significant. Training domain
likewise had no significant effect on user satisfaction.

Task completion. Task completion did not differ sig-
nificantly for the two interfaces. In total, just over two
thirds of the tasks were successfully completed with
each system: 67.4% for the NL-ML and 67.9% for the
SG-ML. The average participant completed 5.2 tasks
with the NL-ML and 5.4 tasks with the SG-ML. As with
user satisfaction, users with CSE or programming back-
ground generally completed more tasks in the SG-ML
system than non-CSE/programming users, but again the
difference was not significant. Training domain had no
significant effect on task completion for either system.
To account for incomplete tasks when comparing
the interfaces, we ordered the task completion measures
(times or turn counts) for each system, leaving all in-
completes at the end of the list as if they had been com-
pleted in “infinite time,” and compared the medians.
Time-to-completion. For completed tasks, the aver-
age time users spent on each SG-ML task was lower
than for the NL-ML system, though not significantly:
67.9 versus 71.3 seconds. Considering incomplete tasks,
the SG-ML performed better than the NL-ML, with a
median time of 81.5 seconds, compared to 103 seconds.
Turns-to-completion. For completed tasks, the av-
erage number of turns users took for each SG-ML task
was significantly higher than for the NL-ML sys-tem:
8.2 versus 3.8 (F=26.4, p&lt;0.01). Considering incom-
plete tasks, the median SG-ML turns-to-completion rate
was twice that of the NL-ML: 10 versus 5.
Word-error rate. The SG-ML had an overall word-
error rate (WER) of 35.1%, compared to 51.2% for the
NL-ML. When calculated for each user, WER ranged
from 7.8% to 71.2% (mean 35.0%, median 30.0%) for
the SG-ML and from 31.2% to 78.6% (mean 50.3%,
median 48.9%) for the NL-ML. The six users with the
highest SG-ML WER were the same ones who preferred
the NL-ML system, and four of them were also the only
users in the study whose NL-ML error rate was lower
than their SG-ML error rate. This suggests, not surpris-
ingly, that WER is strongly related to user preference.
To further explore this correlation, we plotted WER
against users’ overall subjective assessments of each
system, with the results shown in Fig. 3. There is a sig-
nificant, moderate correlation between WER and user
satisfaction for Speech Graffiti (r=-0.66, p&lt;0.01), but no
similar correlation for the NL-ML system (r=0.26).

Understanding error. Word-error rate may not be
the most useful measure of system performance for
many spoken dialogue systems. Because of grammar
redundancies, systems are often able to “understand” an
utterance correctly even when some individual words
are misrecognized. Understanding error rate (UER) may
therefore provide a more accurate picture of the error
rate that a user experiences. For this analysis, we only
made a preliminary attempt at assessing UER. These
error rates were hand-scored, and as such represent an
approximation of actual UER. For both systems, we
calculated UER based on an entire user utterance rather
than individual concepts in that utterance.
SG-ML UER for each user ranged from 2.9% to
65.5% (mean 26.6%, median 21.1%). The average
change per user from WER to understanding-error for
the SG-ML interface was –29.2%.
The NL-ML understanding-error rates differed little
from the NL-ML WER rates. UER per user ranged from
31.4% to 80.0% (mean 50.7%, median 48.5%). The
average change per user from NL-ML WER was +0.8%.

Overall, we found that Speech Graffiti performed
favorably compared to the natural language interface.
Speech Graffiti generated significantly higher user
satisfaction scores, and task completion rates and times
were similar.
The higher turns-to-completion rate for Speech
Graffiti is not necessarily problematic. The phrasal na-
ture of Speech Graffiti syntax seems to encourage users
to input single phrases; we suspect that in a longitudinal
study, we would find single-utterance command use in
SG-ML increasing as users became more familiar with
the system. Furthermore, because the SG-ML splits long
output lists into smaller chunks, a user often has to ex-
plicitly issue a request to hear more items in a list, add-
ing at least one more turn to the interaction. Thus there
exists a trade-off between turn-wise efficiency and re-
duced cognitive load. Because of the reasonable results
shown for the SG-ML in user satisfaction and comple-
tion time, we view this as a reasonable trade-off.
It is possible that if lower word-error rates can be
achieved, Speech Graffiti would become unnecessary.
This may be true for consistent, extremely low word-
error rates, but such rates do not appear to be attainable
in the near term. Furthermore, the correlations in Fig. 3
suggest that as WER decreases, users become more sat-
isfied with the SG interface but that this is not necessar-
ily true for the NL interface. Consider also the effect of
understanding error. UER is the key to good system
performance since even if the system has correctly de-
coded a word string, it must still match that string with
the appropriate concepts in order to perform the desired
action. Although WER may be reduced via improved
language and acoustic models, matching input to under-
standing in NL systems is usually a labor-intensive and
domain-specific task. In contrast, the structured nature
of Speech Graffiti significantly reduces the need for
such intensive concept mapping.
Future work. For Speech Graffiti, scores for
habitability (represented by statements like “I always
knew what to say to the system”) were typically the
lowest of any of the six user satisfaction factors,
suggesting that this is a prime area for further work.
In this regard, it is instructive to consider the ex-
perience of the six users who preferred the NL interface.
Overall, they accounted for the six highest SG-ML
word- and understanding-error rates and the six lowest
SG-ML task completion rates: clearly not a positive
experience. An additional measure of habitability is
grammaticality: how often do users speak within the
Speech Graffiti grammar? The six NL-ML-preferring
users also had low grammaticality rates (Tomko &amp;
Rosenfeld, 2004). These users have become a motivator
of future work: what can be done to make the interface
work for them and others like them? (Future studies will
focus on a broader population of adults.) How can we
help users who are having severe difficulties with an
interface learn how to use it better and faster? To
improve the habitability of Speech Graffiti, we plan to
explore allowing more natural language-esque
interaction while retaining an application-portable
structure. We also plan to refine Speech Graffiti’s
runtime help facilities in order to assist users more
effectively in saying the right thing at the right time.
In addition to these core interface goals, we plan to
extend the functionality of Speech Graffiti beyond
information access to support the creation, deletion and
modification of information in a database.

Speech Graffiti is a structured interaction protocol that is designed to be universal. Common input structures, output patterns and keywords are used for all Speech Graffiti applications, and once users are familiar with these for any single application, they can navigate their way through any other Speech Graffiti application. Fig. 1 shows a sample Speech Graffiti dialog User interactions with Speech Graffiti (independent of other speech interfaces) have previously been assessed in Rosenfeld et al. (2000). Here we consider a head-to-head comparison: given the chance to interact with both types of interfaces, which would people choose?

In this regard, it is instructive to consider the experience of the six users who preferred the NL interface. Overall, they accounted for the six highest SG-ML word- and understanding-error rates and the six lowest SG-ML task completion rates: clearly not a positive experience. An additional measure of habitability is grammaticality: how often do users speak within the Speech Graffiti grammar? The six NL-ML-preferring users also had low grammaticality rates (Tomko &amp; Rosenfeld, 2004). These users have become a motivator of future work: what can be done to make the interface work for them and others like them? (Future studies will focus on a broader population of adults.) How can we help users who are having severe difficulties with an interface learn how to use it better and faster? To improve the habitability of Speech Graffiti, we plan to explore allowing more natural language-esque interaction while retaining an application-portable structure. We also plan to refine Speech Graffiti’s runtime help facilities in order to assist users more effectively in saying the right </context>

To balance this effect for users of the natural language system, which is otherwise intended to be a walk-up-anduse interface, participants engaged in a brief NL “familiarization session” in which they were simply instructed to call the system and try it out. To match the in-domain/out-of-domain variable used in the SG tutorials, half of the NL familiarization sessions used the NL MovieLine and half used MIT’s Jupiter natural language weather information system (Zue et al., 2000). Users typically spent about five minutes exploring the NL systems during the familiarization session. 2.3 Tasks After having completed the training session for a specific system, each user was asked to call that system and attempt a set of tasks (e.g. “list what’s playing at the Squirrel Hill Theater,” “find out &amp; write down what the ratings are for the movies showing at the Oaks Theater”). Participant compensation included task completion bonuses to encourage users to attempt each task in earnest. Regardless of which system they were working with, all users were given the same eight tasks f</context>
