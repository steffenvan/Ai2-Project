This tutorial will give a practical description of the
free software Carnegie Mellon Olympus 2 Spoken
Dialog Architecture. Building real working dialog
systems that are robust enough for the general pub-
lic to use is difficult. Most frequently, the func-
tionality of the conversations is severely limited -
down to simple question-answer pairs. While off-
the-shelf toolkits help the development of such
simple systems, they do not support more ad-
vanced, natural dialogs nor do they offer the trans-
parency and flexibility required by computational
linguistic researchers. However, Olympus 2 offers
a complete dialog system with automatic speech
recognition (Sphinx) and synthesis (SAPI, Festi-
val) and has been used, along with previous ver-
sions of Olympus, for teaching and research at
Carnegie Mellon and elsewhere for some 5 years.
Overall, a dozen dialog systems have been built
using various versions of Olympus, handling tasks
ranging from providing bus schedule information
to guidance through maintenance procedures for
complex machinery, to personal calendar manage-
ment. In addition to simplifying the development
of dialog systems, Olympus provides a transparent
platform for teaching and conducting research on
all aspects of dialog systems, including speech rec-
ognition and synthesis, natural language under-
standing and generation, and dialog and interaction
management.
The tutorial will give a brief introduction to
spoken dialog systems before going into detail

about how to create your own dialog system within
Olympus 2, using the Let&apos;s Go bus information
system as an example. Further, we will provide
guidelines on how to use an actual deployed spo-
ken dialog system such as Let&apos;s Go to validate re-
search results in the real world. As a possible
testbed for such research, we will describe Let&apos;s Go
Lab, which provides access to both the Let&apos;s Go
system and its genuine user population for research
experiments.
