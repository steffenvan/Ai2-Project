Work on centering (Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein 1995) has had a very strong impact both
on research in discourse and on the development of systems for computational dis-
course processing. Early papers such as those of Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1983) and
Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard (1987) have inspired a number of studies that explore
or use centering as an important tool in discourse processing. A number of psycholin-
guistic and cross-language projects have reported promising results. On the other hand,
one of the main ideas of centering theory, that certain entities mentioned in an utterance
are more central than others and that this imposes certain constraints on the use of re-
ferring expressions and in particular on the use of pronouns, has been extensively used
in anaphora resolution. This volume (resulting from a Workshop on Centering Theory
held at the University of Pennsylvania) represents an important follow-up to the work
on centering carried out in the late eighties and early nineties, and in this context it is a
timely collection of a number of interesting contributions. The authors are well known
for their contributions to the theory of centering and to other areas of computational
linguistics.
The book features a clear and well-organized introduction to centering (Walker,
Joshi, Prince) and groups the subsequent chapters thematically into six parts.
Part 1 discusses issues such as the complexity of inference in discourse (Joshi and
Weinstein), summarizes the main goals of the original research on global focusing and
centering, and outlines unsolved problems (Grosz and Sidner).
Part 2 covers utterance-level issues, in particular the ranking of forward-looking
centers (Cote; Hudson-D&apos;Zmura) and proposes an extension of the original intersen-
tential centering model in order to be able to process complex sentences consisting of
multiple clauses (Kameyama).
Part 3 focuses on the cross-linguistic phenomenon of centering and looks at center-
ing in Italian (Di Eugenio), the ranking of forward-looking centers in Turkish (Turan),
and discourse coherence and center shifting in Japanese (Iida).
Part 4 investigates the role of centering in processing models of discourse. It reports
on an attempt to integrate centering theory and the givenness hierarchy (Gundel). It
also discusses the role of the center in assigning antecedents to ambiguous pronouns
(Hudson-D&apos;Zmura and Tanenhaus) and presents a psycholinguistic perspective on cen-
tering as a resource by which speakers and addressees can coordinate their attention
moment by moment as they refer to things (Brennan).
Computational Linguistics Volume 25, Number 4
Part 5 is dedicated to information structure and centering. It covers issues such as
word order and centering in Turkish (Hoffman), centering transitions as a measure of
discourse coherence (Hurewitz), the relationship between centering, global focus, and
right-dislocation (Grosz and Ziv), and recency effects in English inversion (Birner).
Part 6 covers discourse structure and centering, commenting on open questions
such as how local utterance processing relates to the global discourse context and
how centering interacts with the global context in constraining the surface form of
referring expressions other than pronouns (Passonneau). Part 6 also looks at the place
of centering in a general theory of anaphora resolution and proposes a new hybrid
theory that integrates Grosz and Sidner &apos;s discourse structure theory with a dynamic
theory of semantic interpretation (Roberts). Finally in the last chapter of Part 6, it is
argued that the restriction of centering to operate within a discourse segment should
be abandoned in favor of a new model integrating centering and the global discourse
structure and to this end it is proposed that a model of attentional state, the cache
model, be integrated with the centering algorithm (Walker).
Centering has proved to be a powerful tool for accounting for discourse coherence
and has been used successfully in anaphora resolution; however, as with every theory
in linguistics, it has its limitations. Some chapters suggest extensions of or amendments
to the centering theory with a view to achieving a more comprehensive and successful
model (e.g., the chapters by Kameyama, Roberts, and Walker). Ideally, in addition to
papers such as Kameyama&apos;s and Walker&apos;s, this collection could perhaps also have
featured extended versions of papers, such as those of Kehler (1997) and Hahn and
Strube (1997), that highlight certain weaknesses of the original centering model or
suggest extensions or alternative solutions (Strube 1998). It must be acknowledged here
that the production schedule of this volume may have been a factor in not including
some of this recent work, and also that space limits might not have allowed all possible
areas of centering to be covered. These are, however, minor points; the volume is
a very well edited collection of excellent papers, and I recommend it unreservedly
as a valuable source to anyone interested in centering, discourse, or computational
linguistics in general.
