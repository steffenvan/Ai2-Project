Semantic role labeling (SRL) is crucial to
natural language understanding as it identi-
fies the predicate-argument structure in text
with semantic labels. Unfortunately, re-
sources required to construct SRL models
are expensive to obtain and simply do not
exist for most languages. In this paper, we
present a two-stage method to enable the
construction of SRL models for resource-
poor languages by exploiting monolingual
SRL and multilingual parallel data. Exper-
imental results show that our method out-
performs existing methods. We use our
method to generate Proposition Banks with
high to reasonable quality for 7 languages
in three language families and release these
resources to the research community.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.958921767441861">
Semantic role labeling (SRL) is the task of automat-
ically labeling predicates and arguments in a sen-
tence with shallow semantic labels. This level of
analysis provides a more stable semantic representa-
tion across syntactically different sentences, thereby
enabling a range of NLP tasks such as information
extraction and question answering (Shen and Lap-
ata, 2007; Maqsud et al., 2014). Projects such as the
Proposition Bank (PropBank) (Palmer et al., 2005)
spent considerable effort to annotate corpora with
semantic labels, in turn enabling supervised learn-
ing of statistical SRL parsers for English. Unfor-
∗This work was conducted at IBM.
tunately, due to the high costs of manual annota-
tion, comparable SRL resources do not exist for
most other languages, with few exceptions (Hajiˇc
et al., 2009; Erk et al., 2003; Zaghouani et al., 2010;
Vaidya et al., 2011).
As a cost-effective alternative to manual annota-
tion, previous work has investigated the direct pro-
jection of semantic labels from a resource rich lan-
guage (English) to a resource poor target language
(TL) in parallel corpora (Pado, 2007; Van der Plas et
al., 2011). The underlying assumption is that orig-
inal and translated sentences in parallel corpora are
semantically broadly equivalent. Hence, if English
sentences of a parallel corpus are automatically la-
beled using an SRL system, these labels can be pro-
jected onto aligned words in the TL corpus, thereby
automatically labeling the TL corpus with seman-
tic labels. This way, PropBank-like resources can
automatically be created that enable the training of
statistical SRL systems for new TLs.
However, as noted in previous work (Pado, 2007;
Van der Plas et al., 2011), aligned sentences in par-
allel corpora often exibit issues such as translation

shifts that go against this assumption. For example,
in Fig. 1, the English sentence “We need to hold peo-
ple responsible” is translated into a French sentence
that literally reads as “There need to exist those re-
sponsible”. Hence, the predicate label of the English
word “hold” should not be projected onto the French
verb, which has a different meaning. As the exam-
ple in Fig. 1 shows, this means that only a subset of
all SL labels can be directly projected.
In this paper, we aim to create PropBank-like re-
sources for a range of languages from different lan-
guage groups. To this end, we propose a two-stage
approach to cross-lingual semantic labeling that ad-
dresses such errors, shown in Fig. 2: Given a par-
allel corpus in which the source language (SL) side
is automatically labeled with PropBank labels and
the TL side is syntactically parsed, we use a filtered
projection approach that allows the projection only
of high-confidence SL labels. This results in a TL
corpus with low recall but high precision. In the
second stage, we repeatedly sample a subset of com-
plete TL sentences and train a classifier to iteratively
add new labels, significantly increasing the recall in
the TL corpus while retaining the improvement in
precision.
Our contributions are: (1) We propose filtered
projection focused specifically on raising the pre-
cision of projected labels, based on a detailed anal-
ysis of direct projection errors. (2) We propose a
bootstrap learning approach to retrain the SRL to
iteratively improve recall without a significant re-
duction of precision, especially for arguments; (3)
We demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizabil-
ity of our approach via an extensive set of experi-
ments over 7 different language pairs. (4) We gen-
erate PropBanks for each of these languages and re-
lease them to the research community.1

2 Stage 1: Filtered Annotation Projection
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999805225806451">
Stage 1 of our approach (Fig. 2) is designed to create
a TL corpus with high precision semantic labels.
Direct Projection The idea of direct annotation
projection (Van der Plas et al., 2011) is to transfer
semantic labels from SL sentences to TL sentences
according to word alignments. Formally, for each
pair of sentences sSL and sTL in the parallel corpus,
the word alignment produces alignment pairs (wSL,i,
wTL,i0), where wSL,i and wTL,i0 are words from sSL and
sTL respectively. Under direct projection, if lSL,i is
a predicate label for wSL,i and (wSL,i, wTL,i0) is an
alignment pair, then lSL,i is transferred to wTL,i0; If
lSL,j is a predicate-argument label for (wSL,i, wSL,j),
and (wSL,i, wTL,i0) and (wSL,j, wTL,j0) are alignment
pairs, then lSL,j is transferred to (wTL,i0, wTL,j0), as
illustrated below.
Filtered Projection As discussed earlier, direct
projection is vulnerable to errors stemming from
issues such as translation shifts. We propose fil-
tered projection focused specifically on improving
the precision of projected labels. Specifically, for a
pair of sentences sSL and sTL in the parallel corpus,
we retain the semantic label lSL,i projected from wSL,i
onto wTL,i0 if and only if it satisfies the filtering poli-
cies. This results in a target corpus containing fewer
labels but of higher precision compared to that ob-
tained via direct projection.
In the rest of the section, we analyze typical errors
in direct projection (Sec. 2.2), present a set of filters
to handle such errors (Sec. 2.3), and experimentally
evaluate their effectiveness (Sec. 2.4).

<bodyText confidence="0.9997691875">
Data For experiments in this section and Sec. 3, we
used the gold data set compiled by (Van der Plas
et al., 2011), referred to as Frenchgold. It consists
of 1,000 sentence-pairs from the English-French
Europarl corpus (Koehn, 2005) with French sen-
tences manually labeled with predicate and argu-
ment labels from the English Propbank.
Evaluation In line with previous work (Van der Plas
et al., 2010), we count synonymous predicate labels
sharing the same VERBNET (Schuler, 2005) class as
true positives.2 In addition, we exclude modal verbs
from the evaluation due to inconsistent annotation.
Source Language SRL Throughout the rest of the
paper, we use CLEARNLP (Choi and McCallum,
2013), a state-of-the-art SRL system, to produce se-
mantic labels for English text.

2.2 Error Analysis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999865538461538">
We observe that direct projection labels have both
low precision and low recall (see Tab. 3 (Direct)).
Analysis of False Negatives The low recall of di-
rect projection is not surprising; most semantic la-
bels in the French sentences do not appear in the
corresponding English sentences at all. Specifically,
among 1,741 predicate labels in the French sen-
tences, only 778 exist in the corresponding English
sentences, imposing a 45% upper bound on the re-
call for projected predicates. Similarly, of the 5,061
argument labels in the French sentences, only 1,757
exist in the corresponding English sentences, result-
ing in a 35% upper bound on recall for arguments.3
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.9991866">
2For instance, the French verb sembler may be correctly la-
beled as either of the synonyms: seem.01 or appear.02.
3This upper bound is different from the one reported
in (Van der Plas et al., 2011) which corresponds to the inter-
annotator agreement over manual annotation of 100 sentences.

Analysis of False Positives While the recall pro-
duced by direct projection is close to the theoretical
upper bound, the precision is far from the theoretical
upper bound of 100%. To understand causes of false
positives, we examine a random sample of 200 false
positives, of which 100 are incorrect predicate la-
bels, and 100 are incorrect argument labels belong-
ing to correctly projected predicates. Tab. 1 and 2

• Translation Shift: Predicate Mismatch The
most common predicate errors (37%) are translation
shifts in which an English predicate is aligned to a
French verb with a different meaning. Fig. 1 illus-
trates such a translation shift: label hold.01 of En-
glish verb hold is wrongly projected onto the French
verb ait, which is labeled as exist.01 in Frenchgold.
• Translation Shift: Verb→Non-Verb is another
common predicate error (36%). English verbs may
be aligned with TL words other than verbs, which
is often indicative of translation shifts. For instance,
in the following sentence pair

2.3 Filters
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999705864864865">
We consider the following filters to remove the most
common types of false positives.
Verb Filter (VF) targets Verb-*Non-Verb transla-
tion shift errors (Van der Plas et al., 2011). For-
mally, if direct projection transfers predicate label
lSL,i from wSL,i onto wTL,i0, retain lSL,i only if both
wSL,i and wTL,i0 are verbs.
Translation Filter (TF) handles both Predicate
Mismatch and Verb-*Non-Verb translation shift er-
rors. It makes use of a translation dictionary and
allows projection only if the TL verb is a valid trans-
lation of the SL verb. In addition, in order to ensure
consistent predicate labels throughout the TL cor-
pus, if a SL verb has several possible synonymous
translations, it allows projection only for the most
commonly observed translation.
Formally, for an aligned pair (wSL,i, wTL,i0) where
wSL,i has predicate label lSL,i, if (wSL,i, wTL,i0) is not
a verb to verb translation from SL to TL, assign no
label to wTL,i0. Otherwise, split the set of SL trans-
lations of wTL,i0 into synonym sets S1, S2,... ; For
each k, let Wk be the subset of Sk most commonly
aligned with wTL,i0; If wSL,i is in one of these Wk,
assign label lSL,i to wTL,i0; Otherwise assign no label
to wTL,i0.
Reattachment Heuristic (RH) targets non-
argument head errors that occur if a TL argument
is not the direct child of a verb in the dependency
parse tree of its sentence.4 Assume direct projection
transfers the predicate-argument label lSL,j from
(wSL,i, wSL,j) onto (wTL,i0, wTL,j0). Find the immedi-
ate ancestor verb of wTL,j0 in the dependency parse
tree. Denote as wTL,k its child that is an ancestor of
wTL,j0. Assign the label lSL,j to (wTL,i0, wTL,k) instead
of (wTL,i0, wTLj0). An illustration is below:
RH ensures that labels are always attached to the
syntactic heads of their respective arguments, as de-

nodes for argument labels to all nodes that are not a child of
some ancestor of the predicate.

2.4 Filter Effectiveness
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999970961538461">
We now present an initial validation on the effec-
tiveness of the aforementioned filters by evaluating
their contribution to annotation projection quality
for Frenchgold, as summarized in Tab. 3.
VF reduces the number of wrongly projected predi-
cate labels, resulting in an increase of predicate pre-
cision to 59% (T14 pp), without impact to recall. As
a side effect, argument precision also increases to
53% (T10 pp), since, if a predicate label cannot be
projected, none of its arguments can be projected.
TF5 reduces the number of wrongly projected pred-
icate labels even more significantly, increasing pred-
icate precision to 88% (T43 pp), at a small cost to re-
call. Again, argument precision increases as a side
effect. However, as expected, argument recall de-
creases significantly (114 pp, to 17%), as many ar-
guments can no longer be projected.
RH targets argument labels directly (unlike VF and
TF), significantly increasing argument precision and
slightly increasing argument recall.
In summary, initial experiments confirm that our
proposed filters are effective in improving preci-
sion of projected labels at a small cost in recall. In
fact, TF+RH results in nearly 100% improvement in
predicate and argument labels precision with a much
smaller drop in recall.

come from the following sources.
SRL Errors The most common residual errors in
the remaining projected labels, especially for argu-
ment labels, are caused by mistakes made by the En-
glish SRL system. Any wrong label it assigns to an
English sentence may be projected onto the TL sen-
tence, resulting in false positives.
No English Equivalent A small number of errors
occur due to French particularities that do not exist
in English. Such errors include certain French verbs
for which no appropriate English PropBank labels
exists, and French-specific syntactic particularities.6
Gold Data Errors Our evaluation so far relies
on Frenchgold as ground truth. Unfortunately,
Frenchgold does contain a small number of errors
(e.g. missing argument labels). As a result, some
correctly projected labels are being mistaken as
false positives, causing a drop in both precision and
recall. We therefore expect the true precision and
recall of the approach to be somewhat higher than
the estimate based on Frenchgold.

As discussed earlier, the TL corpus generated via fil-
tered projection suffers from low recall. We address
this issue with the second stage of our method.
Relabeling The idea of relabeling (Van der Plas
et al., 2011) is to first train an SRL system over a
TL corpus labeled using direct projection (with VF
filter) and then use this SRL to relabel the corpus,
effectively overwriting the projected labels with po-
tentially less noisy predicted labels.
We first present an analysis on relabeling in con-
cert with our proposed filters (Sec. 3.1), which mo-
tivates our bootstrap algorithm (Sec. 3.2).

experiments, relabeling consistently improves recall
over projection. The results also show how different
factors affect the performance of relabeling.
Supplement vs. Overwrite Projected Labels
The labels produced by the trained SRL can be used
to either overwrite projected labels as in (Van der
Plas et al., 2011), or to supplement them (supply-
ing labels only for words w/o projected labels).
Whether to overwrite or supplement depends on
whether labels produced by the trained SRL are of
higher quality than the projected labels. We find that
while predicted labels are of higher precision than
directly projected labels, they are of lower precision
than labels post filtered projection. Therefore, for
filtered projection, it makes more sense to allow pre-
dicted labels to only supplement projected labels.
Impact of Sampling Method We are further in-
terested in learning the impact of sampling the data
on the quality of relabeling. For the best filter found
earlier (TF+RH), we compare SRL trained on the
entire data set (full data) with SRL trained only on the
subset of completely annotated sentences (comp. sent.),
where completeness is defined as:

We observe that for TF+RH, when new labels
supplement projected labels, relabeling over com-
plete sentences results in better recall at slightly re-
duced precision, while including incomplete sen-
tences into the training data reduces recall, but im-
proves precision. While this finding may seem
counterintuitive, it can be explained by how statis-
tical SRL works. A densely labeled training data
(such as comp. sent.) usually results in an SRL that gen-
erates densely labeled sentences, resulting in better
recall but poorer precision. On the other hand, train-
ing data that is sparsely labeled results in an SRL
that weighs the option of not assigning a label with
higher probability, resulting in better precision and
poorer recall. In short, one can control the trade-
off between precision and recall of SRL output by
manipulating the completeness of the training data.

3.2 Bootstrap Learning
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.905105307692307">
Building on the observation that we can sample data
in such a way as to either favor precision or re-
call, we propose a bootstrapping algorithm to train
an SRL iteratively over k-complete subsets of the
data which are supplemented by high precision la-
bels produced from previous iteration. The detailed
algorithm is depicted in Algorithm 1.
Resampling Threshold Our goal is to use bootstrap
learning to improve recall without sacrificing too
much precision.

the set of labels LTL increases monotonically in each
iteration of Algorithm 1.

Since Prop. 1 guarantees the increase of the set
of labels, we need to select a resampling function to
favor precision while improving recall. Specifically,
we use the formula k(i) = max(k0 − i, 0), where
k0 is sufficiently large. Since the precision of labels
generated by the SRL is lower than the precision of
labels obtained from filtered projection, the preci-
sion of the training data is expected to decrease with
the increase in recall. Therefore, starting with a high
k seeks to ensure high precision labels are added to
the training data in the first iterations. Decreasing k
in each iteration seeks to ensure that resampling is
done in an increasingly restrictive way to ensure that
only high-quality annotated sentences are added to
the training data, thus maintaining a high confidence
in the learned SRL model.

3.3 Effectiveness of Bootstrapping
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999989823529412">
We experimentally evaluate the effectiveness of our
model with k0 = 9.7 As shown in Tab 4, boot-
strapping outperforms relabeling, producing labels
with best overall quality in terms of F1 measure and
recall for both predicates and arguments, with a rel-
atively small cost in precision.
While Algorithm 1 guarantees the increase of re-
call (Prop. 1), it provides no such guarantee on pre-
cision. Therefore, it is important to experimentally
decide an early termination cutoff before the SRL
gets overtrained. To do so, we evaluated the per-
formance of the bootstrapping algorithm at each it-
eration (Fig. 3). We observe that for the first 3 it-
erations, F1-measure for both predicates and argu-
ments rises due to large increase in recall which
offsets the smaller drop in precision. Then F1-
measure remains stable, with recall rising and pre-

there notable differences in quality from language

Data Tab. 5 lists the 7 different TLs and resources
used in our experiments.8 We chose these TLs be-
cause (1) they are among top 10 most influential lan-
guages in the world (Weber, 1997); and (2) we could
find language experts to evaluate the results. English
is used as SL in all our experiments.
Approach Tested For each TL, we used FBbeat
(Sec. 3.3) to generate a corpus with semantic la-
bels. From each TL corpus, we extracted all com-
plete sentences to form the generated PropBanks.
8From each parallel corpus, we only keep sentences that are
considered well-formed based on a set of standard heuristics.
For example, we require a well-formed sentence to end in punc-
tuation and not to contain certain special characters. For Ara-
bic, as the dependency parser we use has relatively poor parsing
accuracy, we additionally require sentences to be shorter than
100 characters.

Manual Evaluation While a gold annotated cor-
pus for French (Frenchgoljwas available for our
experiments in the previous Sections, no such re-
sources existed for the other TLs we wished to eval-
uate. We therefore chose to conduct a manual eval-
uation for each TL, each executed identically: For
each TL we randomly selected 100 complete sen-
tences with their generated semantic labels and as-
signed them to two language experts who were in-
structed to evaluate the semantic labels (based on
their English descriptions) for the predicates and
their core arguments. For each label, they were
asked to determine (1) whether the label is correct;
(2) if yes, then whether the boundary of the labeled
constituent is correct: If also yes, mark the label as
fully correct, otherwise as partially correct.
Metrics We used the standard measures of preci-
sion, recall, and F1 to measure the performance of
the SRLs, with the following two schemes: (1) Ex-
act: Only fully correct labels are considered as true
positives; (2) Partial: Both fully and partially cor-
rect matches are considered as true positives.9

seven languages and generated high quality seman-
tics labels across the board. For predicate labels,
the precision is over 95% and the recall is over 85%
for all languages except for Hindi. For argument
labels, when considering partially correct matches,
the precision is at least 85% (above 90% for most
languages) and the recall is between 66% to 83%
for all the languages. These encouraging results
obtained from a diverse set of languages implies
the generalizability of our method. In addition, the
inter-annotator agreement is very high for all the
languages, indicating that the results obtained based
on manual evaluation are very reliable.
In addition, we make a number of interesting ob-
servations:
Dependency Parsing Accuracy The precision for
exact argument labels is significantly below partial
matches, particularly for Hindi (135 pp) and Ara-
bic (119 pp). Since argument boundaries are deter-
mined syntactically, such errors are caused by de-
pendency parsing. The fact that Hindi and Arbic
suffer the most from this issue is consistent with
the poorer performance of their dependency parsers
compared to other languages (Nivre et al., 2006;
Green and Manning, 2010).
Hindi as the Main Outlier The results for Hindi
are much worse than the results for other languages.
Besides the poorer dependency parser performance,
the size of the parallel corpus used could be a fac-
tor: Hindencorp is one to two orders of magni-
tude smaller than the other corpora. The quality
of the parallel corpus could be a reason as well:
Hindencorp was collected from various sources,
while both UN and Europarl were extracted from
governmental proceedings.
Language-specific Errors Certain errors occur
more frequently in some languages than others. An
example are deverbal nouns in Chinese (Xue, 2006)
in formal passive constructions with support verb
受. Since we currently only consider verbs for pred-

icate labels, predicate labels are projected onto the
support verbs instead of the deverbal nouns. Such
errors appear for light verb constructions in all lan-
guages, but particularly affect Chinese due to the
high frequency of this passive construction in the
UN corpus.
Low Fraction of Complete Sentences As Tab. 7
shows, the fraction of complete sentences in the
generated PropBanks is rather low, indicating the
impact of moderate recall on the size of generated
PropBanks. Especially for languages for which only
small parallel corpora are available, such as Hindi,
this points to the need to address recall issues in fu-
ture work.

4.3 Additional Experiments
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998754631578947">
The observations made in Sec. 4.2 suggests a few
factors that may potentially affect the performance
of our method. To better understand their impact,
we conducted the following initial investigation.
SRL models produced in this set of experiments
were evaluated using Frenchgold, sampled and eval-
uated in the same way as other experiments in this
section for comparability.
Data Size We varied the data size for French by
downsampling the UN corpus. As one can see from
Tab. 8, downsampling the dataset by one order of
magnitude (to 250k sentences) only slightly affects
precision, while downsampling to 25k sentences has
a more pronounced but still small impact on recall.
It appears that data size does not have significant
impact on the performance of our method.
Language-specific Customizations While our
method is language-agnostic, intuitively language-
specific customization can be helpful in address-

<bodyText confidence="0.999804777777778">
ing language-specific errors. As an initial exper-
iment, we added a simple heuristic to filter out
French verbs that are commonly used for “existen-
tial there” constructions, as one type of common
errors for French involves the syntactic expletive
il (Danlos, 2005) in “existential there” constructions
such as il faut (see Fig. 1 (TL sentence) for an ex-
ample) wrongly labeled with with role information.
As shown in Tab. 9, this simple customization re-
sults in a small increase in precision, suggesting that
language-specific customization can be helpful.
Quality of English SRL As noted in Sec. 2.5, errors
made by English SRL are often prorogated to the TL
via projection. To assess the impact of English SRL
quality, we used two different English SRL systems:
CLEARNLP and MATE-SRL. As can be seen from
Tab. 9, the impact of English SRL quality is sub-
stantial on argument labeling.

Annotation Projection in Parallel Corpora to
train monolingual tools for new languages was in-
troduced in the context of learning a PoS tag-
ger (Yarowsky et al., 2001). Similar in spirit to our
approach of using filters to increase the precision
of projected labels, recent work (T¨ackstr¨om et al.,
2013) uses token and type constraints to guide learn-
ing in cross-lingual PoS tagging.
Projection of Semantic Labels was considered for
FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) in (Pad´o and Lapata,
2009; Basili et al., 2009). Recently, however, most
work in the area focuses on PropBank, which has
been identified as a more suitable annotation scheme
for joint syntactic-semantics settings due to broader
coverage (Merlo and van der Plas, 2009), and was
shown to be usable for languages other than En-
glish (Monachesi et al., 2007).
Direct projection of PropBank annotations was
considered in (Van der Plas et al., 2011). Our ap-
proach significantly outperforms theirs in terms of
recall and F1 for both predicates and arguments
(Section 3). A approach was proposed in (Van der
Plas et al., 2014) in which information is aggregated
at the corpus level, resulting in a significantly bet-
ter SRL corpus for French. However, this approach
has several practical limitations: (1) it does not con-
sider the problem of argument identification of SRL
systems, treating arguments as already given; (2) it
generates rules for the argument classification step
preferably from manually annotated data; (3) it has
been demonstrated for a single language (French),
and was not applied to any other language. In con-
trast, our approach trains an SRL system for both
predicate and argument labels, in a completely au-
tomatic fashion. Furthermore, we have applied our
approach to generate PropBanks for 7 languages and
conducted experiments that indicate a high F1 mea-
sure for all languages (Section 4).
Other Related Work A number of approaches such
as model transfer (Kozhevnikov and Titov, 2013)
and role induction (Titov and Klementiev, 2012)
exist for the argument classification step in the SRL
pipeline. In contrast, our work addresses the full
SRL pipeline and seeks to generate SRL resources
for TLs with English PropBank labels.

6 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999707952380952">
We proposed a two-staged method to construct mul-
tilingual SRL resources using monolingual SRL and
parallel data and showed that our method outper-
forms previous approaches in both precision and
recall. More importantly, through comprehensive
experiments over seven languages from three lan-
guage families, we show that our proposed method
works well across different languages without any
language specific customization. Preliminary re-
sults from additional experiments indicate that bet-
ter English SRL and language-specific customiza-
tion can further improve the results, which we aim
to investigate in future work. A qualitative com-
parison against existing or under-construction Prop-
Banks for Chinese (Xue, 2008), Hindi (Vaidya et al.,
2011) or Arabic (Zaghouani et al., 2010) may be in-
teresting, both for comparison of resources and for
defining language-specific customizations. In ad-
dition, we plan to expand our experiments both to
more languages as well as NomBank (Meyers et al.,
2004)-style noun labels.

<abstract confidence="0.998763888888889">Semantic role labeling (SRL) is crucial to natural language understanding as it identifies the predicate-argument structure in text with semantic labels. Unfortunately, resources required to construct SRL models are expensive to obtain and simply do not exist for most languages. In this paper, we present a two-stage method to enable the construction of SRL models for resourcepoor languages by exploiting monolingual SRL and multilingual parallel data. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing methods. We use our method to generate Proposition Banks with high to reasonable quality for 7 languages in three language families and release these resources to the research community.</abstract>
