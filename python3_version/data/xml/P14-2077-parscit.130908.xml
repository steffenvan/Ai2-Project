<bodyText confidence="0.999252615384615">
Recently, users who search on the web are
targeting to more complex tasks due to the
explosive growth of web usage. To accom-
plish a complex task, users may need to ob-
tain information of various entities. For ex-
ample, a user who wants to travel to Beijing,
should book a flight, reserve a hotel room,
and survey a Beijing map. A complex task
thus needs to submit several queries in order
to seeking each of entities. Understanding
complex tasks can allow a search engine to
suggest related entities and help users explic-
itly assign their ongoing tasks.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999855291666667">
The requirement of searching for complex tasks
dramatically increases in current web search.
Users not always search for single information
need (Liao et al., 2012). To accomplish a real-
life complex task, users usually need to obtain
various information of distinct entities on the
web. In this paper, we define the necessary enti-
ties for a complex task as task-intrinsic entities.
For example, a complex task “travel to Beijing”
has at least three task-intrinsic entities, including
a flight ticket, hotel room, and maps. Therefore,
users need submit several queries in order to seek
all of the necessary entities. However, conven-
tional search engines are careless of latent com-
plex tasks behind a search query. Users are guid-
ed to search for each task-intrinsic entity one by
one to accomplish their complex task inefficient-
ly.
Figure 1 shows a complex task consisting of a
task name “travel to Beijing” and several task-
intrinsic entities. A task name is composed of a
task event and a task topic. The task event trig-
gers users to perform exploratory or comparative
search behaviors such as “prepare

something”, “buy something” or “travel to
somewhere”. The task topic is the subject of in-
terest in the complex task. Task-intrinsic entities
are intrinsically demanded by the complex task.
The three queries “Beijing flight ticket”, “Beijing
hotel”, and “Beijing map” are driven by the in-
formation need of each of task-intrinsic entities
with topic “Beijing” and event “travel” for the
hidden complex task “travel to Beijing”.
According to our observation, users may de-
scribe details of a complex task to be done or
already completed via microblogs, e.g., Twitter
or Weibo1. Microblogs are a miniature version of
traditional weblogs. In recent years, many users
post and share their life details with others on
microblogs every day. Due to the post length
limitation (only 140 characters in case of Weibo),
users tend to only describe key points. Table 1
shows an example of a microblog. We can find
that the user, who has an ongoing complex task
“3tQhKA(travel to Beijing)”, mentioned two
task-intrinsic entities “ T(flight ticket)” and
“pct(hotel)”.
In this work, we address the problem of how to
help users efficiently accomplish a complex task
when submitting a single query or multiple que-
ries.

The above three problems are very important
but non-trivial to solve. In this preliminary work,
we only focus on first two sub-problems. We
proposed an entity-driven complex task model
(ECTM) to automatically generate complex task
names and related task-intrinsic entities. To
evaluate our proposed ECTM, we conducted ex-
periments on a large dataset of real-world query
logs. The experimental results show that our
ECTM is able to identify a comprehensive com-

help users accomplish the complex task with less

Recent studies show that about 75% of search
sessions searching for complex tasks (Feild and
Allan, 2013). To help users deal with their com-
plex search tasks, researchers devoted their ef-
forts to understand and identify complex tasks
from search sessions. Boldi et al. (2002) pro-
posed a graph-based approach to dividing a long-
term search session into search tasks. Guo and
Agichtein (2010) made the attempt to investigate
the hierarchical structure of a complex task with
a series of search actions based on search ses-
sions. Cui et al. (2011) proposed random walk
based methods to discover search tasks from
search sessions. Kotov et al. (2011) noticed that a
multi-goal task may require a user to issue a se-
ries of queries, spanning a long period of time
and multiple search sessions. Thus, they ad-
dressed the problem of modeling and analyzing
complex cross-session search tasks. Lucchese et
al. (2011) tried to identify task-based sessions in
query logs by semantic-based features extracted
from Wiktionary and Wikipedia to overcome
lack of semantic information. Ji et al. (2011)
proposed a graph-based regularization algorithm
to predict popular search tasks and simultaneous-
ly classify queries and web pages by building
two content-based classifiers. White et al. (2013)
improved the traditional personalization methods
for search-result re-ranking by exploiting similar
tasks from other users to re-rank search results.
Wang et al. (2013) addressed the problem of ex-
tracting cross session tasks and proposed a task
partition algorithm based on several pairwise
similarity features. Raman et al. (2013) investi-
gated intrinsic diversity (ID) for a search task
and proposed a re-ranking algorithm according to
the ID tasks.
A complex task consists of several sub-tasks,
and each sub-task goal may be composed of a
sequence of search queries. Therefore, modeling
the sub-tasks is necessary for identifying a com-
plex task. Klinkner (2008) proposed a classifica-
tion-based method to divide a single search ses-
sion into tasks and sub-tasks based on the four
types of features, including time, word, query log
sequence, and web search. Lin et al. (2012) de-
fined a search goal as an action-entity pair and
utilized web trigram to generate fine-grained
search goals. Agichetin et al. (2012) conducted a
comprehensive analysis of search tasks and clas-
sified them based on several aspects, such as in-
tent, motivation, complexity, work-or-fun, time-
sensitive, and continued-or-not. Jones and
Yamamoto et al. (2012) proposed an approach to
mining sub-tasks for a task using query cluster-
ing based on bid phrases provided by advertisers.
The most important difference between our work
and previous works is that we further try to gen-
erate task names with related task-intrinsic enti-
ties. To the best of our knowledge, there is no
existing approach to utilizing microblogs in deal-
ing with task identification and generating hu-
man-interpretable names.

<bodyText confidence="0.999987666666667">
Given a query 9, we aim to identify the complex
task for the query. Since the single query is not
able to describe a complex task. Our proposed
ECTM model introduces an expanded query set
Q for helping identify the task . Thus, P(  |9)
can be formulated as follows:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.604777">
P( t |9) =EQ P( Q  |9) P(  |Q ,9) (1)

Since the expanded query set Qt always contain

the input query q, the Equation (1) can thus be
approximated as:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.996612">
P( t |q) =EQ P( Qt |q) P( t |Qt)
t, (2)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9985785">
where P( Qt |q) is the query expansion model.
For P( t |Qt) we utilize a set of microblog posts
m for identifying the complex task t and obtain
the following equation:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.974935">
P( t |Qt) =E P(m |Qt) P( t |m,Qt)m. (3)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.98551175">
For P( t |m, Qt) in Equation (3), the query set Qt
can be omitted since the microblog post set m
contains Qt. The Equation (3) can thus be modi-
fied as follows:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.849944857142857">
P( t |Qt) =E P(m |Qt) P( t |m)m. (4)
Finally, the ECTM can be obtained as follows:

where P( Qt |q) is the query expansion model,
P(m |Qt) is microblog retrieval model, and

in detail respectively.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99751">
3.2 Query Expansion Model
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998946">
In fact, only using a single query is insufficient
to identify the latent complex task. We thus try to
extract task-coherent queries from search ses-
sions. According to our observation, users may
persistently search for the same complex task in
a period of time. However, users may also simul-
taneously interleave search for multiple different
tasks (MacKay and Watters, 2008; Liu and Bel-
kin, 2010). Therefore, identifying task-coherent
queries from search sessions is an important is-
sue. We perform the following processes in order
to extract task-coherent queries.
Given a query log and an input query q, we
first separate queries in the log into search ses-
sions with the time gap of 30 minutes. We ex-
tract search sessions containing the input query q
and thus obtain a set of sessions Sg. To extract
task-coherent queries Qt from the session set Sg,
we employ log-linear model (LLM) with the fol-
lowing three useful features:
Average Query Frequency: In most cases, the
frequency of queries can reflect their importance.
To avoid a long session resulting in high query
frequency, we calculate the normalized query
frequency as:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.990814">
1 freg( gt,$)
fAQFreguency( qt) =  |S t |x EsESgt |s |, (6)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9940784">
where freq( qt,s) is the frequency of the query
qt in session s, Sgt is the sessions containing qt,
 |s |is the number of queries in session s, and
 |Sgt  |is the number of sessions containing query
qt in the set Sgt.
Session Coverage: The queries occurring in sev-
eral sessions are possible candidates in terms of
task-coherence. In order to favor queries occur-
ring in many sessions, we use average session
frequency, which can be calculated as follows:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.463262">
 |Sgt|
fASFreguency ( qt) = exp  |Sq |, (7)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999810444444444">
where  |Sg  |is the number of sessions containing
the input query q in the set Sg,  |Sgt  |is the num-
ber of sessions containing query qt in the set Sgt,
and exp(-) is the exponential function.
Average Query Distance: Since queries which
close to the input query in a search session may
have high task-coherence for the latent complex
task. We thus use normal distribution to estimate
the task-coherence for each query:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.902692">
( qt) = 1 e 2a2 8
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9740391875">
vla7c,( )
where Q is standard deviation (is empirically set
0.2 in this work), d is the average number of
queries between qt and input query q in sessions.
We employ log-linear model to calculate the
probability of each candidate task-coherent query
based on the features described above:
exp(ffll wifi( gt))
P( qt W) =
where Qt is the set of all candidate queries in the
session set Sg,  |F |is the number of used feature
functions f ( qt), W is the set of weighting pa-
rameters wi of feature functions, and Z(Qt) is a
normalizing factor set to the value Z( Qt)|F|

3.3 Microblog Retrieval Model

<bodyText confidence="0.999463923076923">
Since the task names are not always observable
in the expanded query set Qt, we thus need fur-
ther expanding Qt by retrieving microblog posts.
The basic idea is that a microblog post contain-
ing all queries in Qt may also contain the task
name (see the example in Table 1). In fact, the
queries in the query set Qt usually consist of a
topic name and a task-intrinsic entity. For exam-
ple a query “3tY T(Beijing flight ticket)”
contains a topic “3tY(Beijing)” and an entity
“ T(flight ticket)”. Therefore, we first try to
extract task-intrinsic entities from the query set
Q by extracting all common nouns in each of

queries. We can thus obtain a list of task-intrinsic

entities ordered by the occurrence frequency
of each entity. Since a microblog post may only
contain a part of entities for a complex task, we
generate pseudo queries based on all subsets con-
taining two or three entities from top-n entities of
. Finally, we use all generated pseudo queries
to retrieve microblog posts.

tract all bigrams and trigrams which match the

According to our observation, the POS of a task
topic is usually a proper noun ( ) and the POS
of a task event is usually a transitive verb ( ) +
common noun ( ) or an intransitive verb ( ).
On the other hand, a task topic may be the most
important term in related search sessions . More

Different from long-text documents (e.g.,
webpages), microblog posts are relatively short
and hard to find features based on special sec-
tions in content (e.g., anchor text, title, or blocks).
Therefore, we use five efficient features pro-
posed by Zeng et al. (2004) to extract complex
task names from short-text snippets, such as mi-
croblog post or search-result snippets. The fea-
tures proposed by Zeng et al. including TFIDF,
phrase length, intra-cluster similarity, cluster en-
tropy, and phrase independence. Furthermore, in
this work, we plus two practical features task
name coverage (the percentage of microblog
posts containing the candidate task name) and
chi-square score (Manning, 1999).
Based on the set of extracted candidate task
names for the input query , we also utilized
LLM to select the potential task names with the
highest likelihood. The LLM for identifying
complex task names is given as follows:

We use a one-month query logs from the Sogou
search engine, which contains 21,422,773 rec-
ords and 3,163,170 distinct queries. Each record
contains user ID, query, clicked URL, user
clicked order for the query, and the search-result
rank of the clicked URL. We group query rec-
ords into sessions according to user ID. Since a
complex search task may take a long time to ac-
complish, we used one week as the time gap to
split sessions, and finally obtained 264,360 ses-
sions. For microblogs, we collected the top 50
posts for each pseudo query from Weibo.
To evaluate the performance of our proposed
ECTM model, we manually selected 30 testing
queries from sessions which are searching for
complex tasks. For each query, we employ three
annotators to label complex task names. Three
annotators independently annotated 30 queries.
We further examined the labeled results, and uni-
fied the similar task names. For instances, “北京
旅遊 (travel to Beijing)” and “北京旅行 (trip to

The weights of feature functions are learned by
five-fold cross-validation based on our labeled

4.4 Results of Task Name Identification
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999931806451613">
We use average top k inclusion rate as the met-
rics. For a set of queries, its top k inclusion rate
is defined as the percentage of the query set
whose correct task names occur in the first k
identified task names. The overall results are
shown in Table 4. We can see that our
ECTM_MB outperform other methods. The
ECTM_MB can identify correct task names
within the first three recommendations. Unsur-
prisingly, Cluster_Q_RS achieved worst inclu-
sion rate. The reason is that Cluster _Q_RS try to
find comprehensive complex task name based on
search results from only a single query. Most of
task names suggested by Cluster_Q_RS are sim-
ple task names i.e., the sub-tasks for the latent
complex task, such as “預訂機T(book flight
tickets)”. For ECTM_RS, which is a variation of
Cluster_EQ_RS, it achieved slightly better per-
formance by adding the restrictions of POS pat-
terns for extracting candidate task names. Since
some identified task names in Cluster_EQ_RS
may not semantically suitable, ECTM_RS’s ap-
proach can efficiently deal with this problem.
Furthermore, we also found that using search-
result snippets may generate worse task names
than using microblog posts. According to our
investigating on the two types of the short-text-
snippet resources, the search-result snippets are
very diverse and task-extrinsic while microblog
posts are task-coherent in describing real-life
tasks.

<bodyText confidence="0.99987025">
In this work, we proposed an entity-driven com-

problem of improving user experience when
searching for a complex task. Experimental re-

Nevertheless, there are still some problems that
need to be solved. In the future, we will try to
investigate ranking algorithms for developing a
novel complex-task-based search engine, which
can deal with queries based on complex tasks in
real life.

<abstract confidence="0.998804571428572">Recently, users who search on the web are targeting to more complex tasks due to the explosive growth of web usage. To accomplish a complex task, users may need to obtain information of various entities. For example, a user who wants to travel to Beijing, should book a flight, reserve a hotel room, and survey a Beijing map. A complex task thus needs to submit several queries in order to seeking each of entities. Understanding complex tasks can allow a search engine to suggest related entities and help users explicitly assign their ongoing tasks.</abstract>

Understanding complex tasks can allow a search engine to suggest related entities and help users explicitly assign their ongoing tasks. 1 Introduction The requirement of searching for complex tasks dramatically increases in current web search. Users not always search for single information need (Liao et al., 2012). To accomplish a reallife complex task, users usually need to obtain various information of distinct entities on the web. In this paper, we define the necessary entities for a complex task as task-intrinsic entities. For example, a complex task “travel to Beijing” has at least three task-intrinsic entities, including a flight ticket, hotel room, and maps. Therefore, users need submit several queries in order to seek all of the necessary entities. However, conventional search engines are careless of latent complex tasks behind a search query. Users are guided to search for each task-intrinsic </context>

(2013) investigated intrinsic diversity (ID) for a search task and proposed a re-ranking algorithm according to the ID tasks. A complex task consists of several sub-tasks, and each sub-task goal may be composed of a sequence of search queries. Therefore, modeling the sub-tasks is necessary for identifying a complex task. Klinkner (2008) proposed a classification-based method to divide a single search session into tasks and sub-tasks based on the four types of features, including time, word, query log sequence, and web search. Lin et al. (2012) defined a search goal as an action-entity pair and utilized web trigram to generate fine-grained search goals. Agichetin et al. (2012) conducted a comprehensive analysis of search tasks and classified them based on several aspects, such as intent, motivation, complexity, work-or-fun, timesensitive, and continued-or-not. Jones and Yamamoto et al. (2012) proposed an approach to mining sub-tasks for a task using query clustering based on bid phrases provided by advertisers.

In the following section, we will describe the three models in detail respectively. 3.2 Query Expansion Model In fact, only using a single query is insufficient to identify the latent complex task. We thus try to extract task-coherent queries from search sessions. According to our observation, users may persistently search for the same complex task in a period of time. However, users may also simultaneously interleave search for multiple different tasks (MacKay and Watters, 2008; Liu and Belkin, 2010). Therefore, identifying task-coherent queries from search sessions is an important issue. We perform the following processes in order to extract task-coherent queries. Given a query log and an input query q, we first separate queries in the log into search sessions with the time gap of 30 minutes. We extract search sessions containing the input query q and thus obtain a set of sessions Sg. To extract task-coherent queries Qt from the session set Sg, we employ log-linear model (LLM) with the following three useful features: Average Query Frequency: In most cases, the frequency of queries can r</context>

Thus, they addressed the problem of modeling and analyzing complex cross-session search tasks. Lucchese et al. (2011) tried to identify task-based sessions in query logs by semantic-based features extracted from Wiktionary and Wikipedia to overcome lack of semantic information. Ji et al. (2011) proposed a graph-based regularization algorithm to predict popular search tasks and simultaneously classify queries and web pages by building two content-based classifiers. White et al. (2013) improved the traditional personalization methods for search-result re-ranking by exploiting similar tasks from other users to re-rank search results. Wang et al. (2013) addressed the problem of extracting cross session tasks and proposed a task partition algorithm based on several pairwise similarity features. Raman et al.

Klinkner (2008) proposed a classification-based method to divide a single search session into tasks and sub-tasks based on the four types of features, including time, word, query log sequence, and web search. Lin et al. (2012) defined a search goal as an action-entity pair and utilized web trigram to generate fine-grained search goals. Agichetin et al. (2012) conducted a comprehensive analysis of search tasks and classified them based on several aspects, such as intent, motivation, complexity, work-or-fun, timesensitive, and continued-or-not. Jones and Yamamoto et al. (2012) proposed an approach to mining sub-tasks for a task using query clustering based on bid phrases provided by advertisers. The most important difference between our work and previous works is that we further try to generate task names with related task-intrinsic entities. To the best of our knowledge, there is no existing approach to utilizing microblogs in dealing with task identification and generating human-interpretable names. 3 Entity-driven Complex Task Model 3.1 Problem Formulation Given a query 9, we aim to identify the complex task for the query.

Correct Task Name Determination Different from long-text documents (e.g., webpages), microblog posts are relatively short and hard to find features based on special sections in content (e.g., anchor text, title, or blocks). Therefore, we use five efficient features proposed by Zeng et al. (2004) to extract complex task names from short-text snippets, such as microblog post or search-result snippets. The features proposed by Zeng et al. including TFIDF, phrase length, intra-cluster similarity, cluster entropy, and phrase independence. Furthermore, in this work, we plus two practical features task name coverage (the percentage of microblog posts containing the candidate task name) and chi-square score (Manning, 1999). Based on the set of extracted candidate task names for the input query , we also utilized LLM to select the potential task names with the highest likelihood. The LLM for </context>

They proposed five features including TFIDF, phrase length, intra-cluster similarity, cluster entropy, and phrase independence. • Cluster_EQ_RS: Since the above method only aim to identify important phrases from a single query, the result should be not fair for the problem addressed in this work. We try to enhance Cluster_Q_RS using expanded search-result snippets proposed in this work. • ECTM_RS: This method further use our suggested POS patterns for extracting candidate task names and use all features proposed in Section </context>
