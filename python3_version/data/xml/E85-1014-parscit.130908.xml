We single out a class of prototypes i.e.,
a class of constructions forcing the obligatory
coreference or obligatory noncorefarence. An
essential feature of prototypes is their
undistinctiveness. In this sense they are the
most natural and efficient means of
communication in discourse.
The non-application of prototype should be
well motivated. This leads to the rule of
restricted choice stating that whenever it is
possible the application of a prototype should
be preferred.
The rule of the restricted choice suggests
the general outline of interpreting ambiguous
sentences, strictly speaking, the method of
ordering admissible interpretations: those which
can be equivalently expressed by means of
a prototype are less probable. In other words,
the rule of the restricted choice can be
regarded as some kind of mechanism ordering
the hypotheses for computation.
INTRODUCTION
The crucial problem in discourse analysis
is the appropriate transposition of all
expressions occurring in it, into reality (see,
for instance, the framework provided by Kamp
in (Kamp, 1981)). Even preliminary analysis
shows that one real object can be identified
by various surface constructions. This forces
the necessity of dividing surface expressions
intc classes denoting identical individuals.
The above problem can formally be stated
as follows. To each discourse D we assign
some reality which can be understood as
a set ID of individuals (semantic discourse
domain) together with a set of relations
defined on ID. The semantic discourse domain
can be interpreted twofold:
lo
as a set of real objects i.e., objects
existing in actual world;
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.669294">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999039933333333">
as a set of mental objects i.e., objects
existing in language user &apos;s mind.
Although the first interpretation is more
natural, it leads to some ontological problems,
concerning the distinction of fictitious and
non-fictitious entities. Since there is no such
distinction from linguistic perspective the
second interpretation seems better motivated.
The next step is to define syntactic
discourse domain, denoted by SD, i.e., a set
of discourse expressions referring to
individuals (set of individuals). The mapping
assigning individuals to syntactic expressions
will be called the reference function and
denoted by R. Formally, R : SD 2.

We say that discourse expressions x and
y are coreferencial, what we denote by xCy,
if and only if they refer to the same set of
individuals.
Formally,
for each x,y xCy iff R(x) R(y)
It is readily verified that C is an
equivalence relation. Obviously each
equivalence class of C contains coreferential
expressions. The set of equivalence classes
of C will be called the reference state of
discourse and denoted by RSD.

<bodyText confidence="0.983402753246754">
reference state. In this sense RSD is a
dynamic notion Let us note also that the
problem of anaphora solution can be regarded
as defining the relation C for the whole
discourse.
Both the speaker, while constructing
a discourse, and the hearer, while analysing
it, try to achieve the identity of RSD at each
step of the discourse. We argue in this
paper that to accomplish this effect, the
speaker has at his disposal (at each moment)
a more restricted set of linguistic
constructions than it seems intuitively. Let
us notice that expressions belonging to one
equivalence class have various syntactic
shapes at different steps of discourse. It can
be shown that the syntactic form of
expressions at particular moments is not
accidential, i.e., elements of indicated
equivalence class are not interchangeable.
PROTOTYPES
Recent discourse theories provide several
levels of language analysis: morphological,
syntactic, semantic and sometimes pragmatic.
Each of these levels determines a
characteristic set of notions and mechanisms.
It is assumed here that the analysis of an
utterance on each levels of language should
yield complete information obtainable by tools
available on this level.
Classical anaphor resolvers act on
semantic level on discourse analysis. We take
the position that for inflexional languages the
coreference relation can be partially described
on the syntactic level. An essential feature of
this partial characteristic is defining the
coreference relation quite apart from real
individuals, i.e. without specyfing the reference
function.
To fix some ideas let us consider an
utterance containing the noun phrases NPi,
NP. If there is no information regarding
coreference, all we can do is to assert that
the coreference relation is included between
the &amp;quot;minimal&amp;quot; relation, i.e., relation identified
by the unit equivalence classes NP a , ••••
NPn and the maximal one, i.e. admitting in
one class all number-gender agreeable
phrases.
We very seldom deal with such a situation
in practice. Almost always we can assign to
an utterance a syntactic level information
stating obligatory coreference or obligatory
noncoreference of some expressions.
The surface constructions carrying this
kind of information with respect to pronouns
and zero pronouns (in the case of elided
subject) will be called prototypes. In other
words prototypes can be regarded as
syntactic means forcing obligatory coreference
or obligatory noncoreference between pronouns
or zero pronouns and other surface
expressions.
Let us consider few instances of
prototypes. Because the ideas presented here
are implemented for the Polish language, the
notion of prototype will be illustrated with
a number of Polish sentences. An elided
subject, specific for inflexional languages can
be observed here. It is denoted by a
Because elided subject expresses some
aspects of thematic continuity, its
interpretation seems to be an important step
during discourse analysis. English
translations of presented examples preserve
their syntactic shape. Unfortunately they are
sometimes incorrect as English sentences.

The above examples pose the question of
how the class of prototypes should be singled
out. This problem can be solved by
specifying a collection of rules concerning
the obligatory coreference and obligatory
noncoreference. The exact format of these
rules is beyond the scope of this paper.
For inflexional languages they depend on the
type of considered sentence, the sentence-
-level functions of considered phrases
and their syntactic shape. As a simple
example of such a rule let us consider the
basic criterion of excluding coreference:
If the object is expressed by means of
a reflexive pronoum, then it is coreferential
with the subject; in other cases the
referential identity of the subject and object
is excluded.
This criterion can be applied both for
deterthinig coreferents of objects - blocking
the subject, and in testing the possible
antecedents of the subject - blocking the
objects. This is exactly the case we have in
(5).
THE RULE OF RESTRICTED CHOICE
A conclusive criterion of being a prototype
results from analysing a given sentence in
isolation. If it is possible to assert or to
exclude the referential identity of some
expressions of the sentence, indepedently of
its context then the sentence can be regarded
as an instance of prototype. An essential
feature of prototypes is that they are
completely indistinctive and in this sense they
are the most proper tool for expressing
a certain relationship in the utterance. This
strong relationship makes it possible to
eliminate some interpretations, which in other
cases should be regarded as probable too.
If we agree that achieving unambiguity of
discourse is the major goal both for the
speaker and the hearer, then the non-
-application of prototype, as the most natural
and efficient means of communication should
be well motivated. When such a special reason
is lacking, the speaker should apply a
a prototype. Under this assumption the set of
linguistic tools available to the speaker is
restricted.
The notion of prototype can be naturally
applied on the syntactic level of discourse
analysis to limit the number of hypotheses for
further consideration. But it can also be useful
on the higher levels to interpret ambiguous
discourses. Strictly speaking the properties
of prototype suggest the general outline of
interpreting ambiguous sentences, more
precisely a method of ordering possible
interpretations with respect to their plausibility.
From the set of possible interpretations of
a sentence, those that can be equivalently
expressed by means of prototype, should be
regarded as less plausible. The justification
of this choice is clear: if the speaker wanted
to point out such an interpretation, he would
naturally achieve it by applying a prototype.
In view of the obove we can formulate
the rule of restricted choice. It states that
whenever it is possible the application of
a prototype should be preferred.
It is important to notice that the rule of
restricted choice can be viewed from the
perspective both of the speaker contructing
the discourse and the hearer modelling it.
The speaker should apply prototypes
whenever it is possible. The hearer should
take this fact into consideration.
Let us try to interpret the concrete
sentences with the help of the rule of
restricted choice.

There are two interpretations here:

(10) Zanim 01 wyszecll, Jan zgasit gwiatto.

(0 denotes the reference to the context).
But the first interpretation can be expressed
by means of prototypes.
(P1) Zanim 01 wyszedt, 02 zgasit iwiatto.
Before 01 left, 02 turned the light off.
(P2) Jan zanim wyszedt, 01 zgasit gwiatto.
John before left, 01. turned the light off.
According to the rule of restricted choice
the first interpretation should be regarded as
less probable (note that it can be expressed
by prototype). Hence the second interpretation
should be chosen.

<bodyText confidence="0.90750525">
Another example is more complicated.
(11) Zanim on wyszedt, 01 zapytat go,

Before he left , 01 had asked him,
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.994754971428572">
whether 02 would have gone to the
cinema.
In the embedded clause
01 zapytat go
there acts the rule of obligatory noncoreference
excluding the referential identily of subject and
object in this sentence:
Zanim on wyszedt, 01 za.pytai go,
czy 02 pOjdzie do kina.
According to our definition the above sentence
is an instance of a prototype.
Excluding the coreference of pointed
expressions decreases the numer of possible
interpretations, but does not clear up all
referential relationships in this ambiguous
sentence. Although there are no further
syntactic premises to resolve this ambiguity
we can specify the less probable interpretation
by appying the rule of restricted choice. If the
speaker wanted to express the following
sense:
(12) Zanim X wyszedl, X zapytat go,
czy 01 pojdzie do kina.
he should have used the following (structural)
prototype:
(13) Zanim 1 zapytat go,
czy 02 pOjdzie do kina.
(In such a sequence of clauses in the
sentence the rule of obligatory coreference
demandes that 0 and 01 should be identified).
It follows therefore that the interpretation:
(14) Zanim on wyszedb.,01. zapytat go,
czy 02 pOjdzie do kina.
is the less probable and should be computed
as the last one.

NONMONOTONICITY OF THE RULE
OF RESTRICTED CHOICE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.944956166666667">

(15) Kiedy 01 podszedt do Piotra,

he was nervous.
There are two possible interpretations

<bodyText confidence="0.999254689655172">
Because the second interpretation can
unambiguously be expressed by the prototypical
construction:
(1.8) Kiedy 1 podszedt do Piotra, by 02
zdenerwowany.
When ;?)1 came near Peter 02 was
nervous.
according to the rule of restricted choice the
first interpretation should be preferred.
The rule of restricted choice is based on
the assumption that whenever it is possible
people use unambiguous constructions.
Although usually valid this assumption cannot
be regarded as general truth. This means that
the rule of restricted choice enables one to
jump to plausible but not ironclad conclusions.
Typically, such conclusions can be invalidated
when new information is available. In our
example the preferred interpretation might he
overturned when we extend our discourse as
follows:
(19) Kiedy 01 podszedt do Piotra,
byt on zdenerwowany.
By to wynik wczegniejszej ktOtni
z Piotrem.
When 01 came near Peter he was
nervous.

quarrel with Peter.

The necessity of changing the preferred
interpretation follcws from the fact that new
informa.tion is available. The prcperty of
drawing plavsible but defeasible inferences
characterizes non-monotonic reasoning.
Various forms of this kind of reasoning are
now being developed (see (AAAI-84 ) ).
It is now widely recognized that discourse
