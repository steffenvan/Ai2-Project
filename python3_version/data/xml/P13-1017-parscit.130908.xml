In this paper, we explore a novel bilin-
gual word alignment approach based on
DNN (Deep Neural Network), which has
been proven to be very effective in var-
ious machine learning tasks (Collobert
et al., 2011). We describe in detail
how we adapt and extend the CD-DNN-
HMM (Dahl et al., 2012) method intro-
duced in speech recognition to the HMM-
based word alignment model, in which
bilingual word embedding is discrimina-
tively learnt to capture lexical translation
information, and surrounding words are
leveraged to model context information
in bilingual sentences. While being ca-
pable to model the rich bilingual corre-
spondence, our method generates a very
compact model with much fewer parame-
ters. Experiments on a large scale English-
Chinese word alignment task show that the
proposed method outperforms the HMM
and IBM model 4 baselines by 2 points in
F-score.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999926446428572">
Recent years research communities have seen a
strong resurgent interest in modeling with deep
(multi-layer) neural networks. This trending topic,
usually referred under the name Deep Learning, is
started by ground-breaking papers such as (Hin-
ton et al., 2006), in which innovative training pro-
cedures of deep structures are proposed. Unlike
shallow learning methods, such as Support Vector
Machine, Conditional Random Fields, and Maxi-
mum Entropy, which need hand-craft features as
input, DNN can learn suitable features (represen-
tations) automatically with raw input data, given a
training objective.
DNN did not achieve expected success until
2006, when researchers discovered a proper way
to intialize and train the deep architectures, which
contains two phases: layer-wise unsupervised pre-
training and supervised fine tuning. For pre-
training, Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM)
(Hinton et al., 2006), auto-encoding (Bengio et al.,
2007) and sparse coding (Lee et al., 2007) are pro-
posed and popularly used. The unsupervised pre-
training trains the network one layer at a time, and
helps to guide the parameters of the layer towards
better regions in parameter space (Bengio, 2009).
Followed by fine tuning in this region, DNN is
shown to be able to achieve state-of-the-art per-
formance in various area, or even better (Dahl et
al., 2012) (Kavukcuoglu et al., 2010). DNN also
achieved breakthrough results on the ImageNet
dataset for objective recognition (Krizhevsky et
al., 2012). For speech recognition, (Dahl et al.,
2012) proposed context-dependent neural network
with large vocabulary, which achieved 16.0% rel-
ative error reduction.
DNN has also been applied in Natural Lan-
guage Processing (NLP) field. Most works con-
vert atomic lexical entries into a dense, low di-
mensional, real-valued representation, called word
embedding; Each dimension represents a latent as-
pect of a word, capturing its semantic and syntac-
tic properties (Bengio et al., 2006). Word embed-
ding is usually first learned from huge amount of
monolingual texts, and then fine-tuned with task-
specific objectives. (Collobert et al., 2011) and
(Socher et al., 2011) further apply Recursive Neu-
ral Networks to address the structural prediction
tasks such as tagging and parsing, and (Socher
et al., 2012) explores the compositional aspect of
word representations.
Inspired by successful previous works, we pro-
pose a new DNN-based word alignment method,
which exploits contextual and semantic similari-
ties between words. As shown in example (a) of
Figure 1, in word pair {“juda” ⇒“mammoth”},
the Chinese word “juda” is a common word, but

the English word “mammoth” is not, so it is very
hard to align them correctly. If we know that
“mammoth” has the similar meaning with “big”,
or “huge”, it would be easier to find the corre-
sponding word in the Chinese sentence. As we
mentioned in the last paragraph, word embedding
(trained with huge monolingual texts) has the abil-
ity to map a word into a vector space, in which,
similar words are near each other.
For example (b) in Figure 1, for the word pair
{“yibula” ⇒ “Yibula”}, both the Chinese word
“yibula” and English word “Yibula” are rare name
entities, but the words around them are very com-
mon, which are {“nongmin”, “shuo”} for Chinese
side and {“farmer”, “said”} for the English side.
The pattern of the context {“nongmin X shuo”
⇒ “farmer X said”} may help to align the word
pair which fill the variable X, and also, the pattern
{“yixiang X gongcheng” ⇒ “a X job”} is helpful
to align the word pair {“juda” ⇒“mammoth”} for
example (a).
Based on the above analysis, in this paper, both
the words in the source and target sides are firstly
mapped to a vector via a discriminatively trained
word embeddings, and word pairs are scored by a
multi-layer neural network which takes rich con-
texts (surrounding words on both source and target
sides) into consideration; and a HMM-like distor-
tion model is applied on top of the neural network
to characterize structural aspect of bilingual sen-
tences.
In the rest of this paper, related work about
DNN and word alignment are first reviewed in
Section 2, followed by a brief introduction of
DNN in Section 3. We then introduce the details
of leveraging DNN for word alignment, including
the details of our network structure in Section 4
and the training method in Section 5. The mer-
its of our approach are illustrated with the experi-
ments described in Section 6, and we conclude our
paper in Section 7.

DNN with unsupervised pre-training was firstly
introduced by (Hinton et al., 2006) for MNIST
digit image classification problem, in which, RBM
was introduced as the layer-wise pre-trainer. The
layer-wise pre-training phase found a better local
maximum for the multi-layer network, thus led to
improved performance. (Krizhevsky et al., 2012)
proposed to apply DNN to do object recognition
task (ImageNet dataset), which brought down the
state-of-the-art error rate from 26.1% to 15.3%.
(Seide et al., 2011) and (Dahl et al., 2012) apply
Context-Dependent Deep Neural Network with
HMM (CD-DNN-HMM) to speech recognition
task, which significantly outperforms traditional
models.
Most methods using DNN in NLP start with a
word embedding phase, which maps words into
a fixed length, real valued vectors. (Bengio et
al., 2006) proposed to use multi-layer neural net-
work for language modeling task. (Collobert et al.,
2011) applied DNN on several NLP tasks, such
as part-of-speech tagging, chunking, name entity
recognition, semantic labeling and syntactic pars-
ing, where they got similar or even better results
than the state-of-the-art on these tasks. (Niehues
and Waibel, 2012) shows that machine transla-
tion results can be improved by combining neural
language model with n-gram traditional language.
(Son et al., 2012) improves translation quality of
n-gram translation model by using a bilingual neu-
ral language model. (Titov et al., 2012) learns a
context-free cross-lingual word embeddings to fa-
cilitate cross-lingual information retrieval.
For the related works of word alignment, the
most popular methods are based on generative
models such as IBM Models (Brown et al., 1993)
and HMM (Vogel et al., 1996). Discriminative ap-
proaches are also proposed to use hand crafted fea-
tures to improve word alignment. Among them,
(Liu et al., 2010) proposed to use phrase and rule
pairs to model the context information in a log-
linear framework. Unlike previous discriminative
methods, in this work, we do not resort to any hand
crafted features, but use DNN to induce “features”
from raw words.

The most important and prevalent features avail-
able in NLP are the words themselves. To ap-
ply DNN to NLP task, the first step is to trans-
form a discrete word into its word embedding, a
low dimensional, dense, real-valued vector (Ben-
gio et al., 2006). Word embeddings often implic-
itly encode syntactic or semantic knowledge of
the words. Assuming a finite sized vocabulary V ,
word embeddings forma (Lx|V |)-dimension em-
bedding matrix WV , where L is a pre-determined
embedding length; mapping words to embed-
dings is done by simply looking up their respec-
tive columns in the embedding matrix WV . The
lookup process is called a lookup layer LT , which
is usually the first layer after the input layer in neu-
ral network.
After words have been transformed to their em-
beddings, they can be fed into subsequent classi-
cal network layers to model highly non-linear re-
lations:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.991798">
zl = fl(Mlzl−1 + bl) (1)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999779625">
where zl is the output of lth layer, Ml is a |zl |x
|zl−1 |matrix, bl is a |zl|-length vector, and fl
is an activation function. Except for the last
layer, fl must be non-linear. Common choices for
fl include sigmoid function, hyperbolic function,
“hard” hyperbolic function etc. Following (Col-
lobert et al., 2011), we choose “hard” hyperbolic
function as our activation function in this work:

If probabilistic interpretation is desired, a softmax
layer (Bridle, 1990) can be used to do normaliza-
tion:

The above layers can only handle fixed sized in-
put and output. If input must be of variable length,
convolution layer and max layer can be used, (Col-
lobert et al., 2011) which transform variable length
input to fixed length vector for further processing.
Multi-layer neural networks are trained with
the standard back propagation algorithm (LeCun,
1985). As the networks are non-linear and the
task specific objectives usually contain many lo-
cal maximums, special care must be taken in the
optimization process to obtain good parameters.
Techniques such as layerwise pre-training(Bengio
et al., 2007) and many tricks(LeCun et al., 1998)
have been developed to train better neural net-
works. Besides that, neural network training also
involves some hyperparameters such as learning
rate, the number of hidden layers. We will address
these issues in section 4.

4 DNN for word alignment
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99996275">
Our DNN word alignment model extends classic
HMM word alignment model (Vogel et al., 1996).
Given a sentence pair (e, f), HMM word alignment
takes the following form:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.999591">
P(a, e|f) = � |e |Plex(ei|fai)Pd(ai − ai−1) (4)
i=1
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.99995025">
where Plex is the lexical translation probability
and Pd is the jump distance distortion probability.
One straightforward way to integrate DNN
into HMM is to use neural network to compute
the emission (lexical translation) probability Plex.
Such approach requires a softmax layer in the neu-
ral network to normalize over all words in source
vocabulary. As vocabulary for natural languages
is usually very large, it is prohibitively expen-
sive to do the normalization. Hence we give up
the probabilistic interpretation and resort to a non-
probabilistic, discriminative view:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9996795">
sNN(a|e,f) = � |e |tlex(ei, fai|e, f)td(ai, ai−1|e, f)
i=1
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.995298">
(5)
where tlex is a lexical translation score computed
by neural network, and td is a distortion score.
In the classic HMM word alignment model,
context is not considered in the lexical translation
probability. Although we can rewrite Plex(ei|fai)
to Plex(ei|context of fai) to model context, it in-
troduces too many additional parameters and leads
to serious over-fitting problem due to data sparse-
ness. As a matter of fact, even without any con-
texts, the lexical translation table in HMM al-
ready contains O(|Ve |* |Vf|) parameters, where
|Ve |and Vf denote source and target vocabulary
sizes. In contrast, our model does not maintain
a separate translation score parameters for every
source-target word pair, but computes tlex through
a multi-layer network, which naturally handles
contexts on both sides without explosive growth
of number of parameters.

Figure 2 shows the neural network we used
to compute context dependent lexical transla-
tion score tlex. For word pair (ei, fj), we take
fixed length windows surrounding both ei and fj
as input: (ei− sw2 , . . . ,ei+ sw2 , fj−t2 ,..., fj+t2 ),
where sw, tw stand window sizes on source and
target side respectively. Words are converted to
embeddings using the lookup table LT, and the
catenation of embeddings are fed to a classic neu-
ral network with two hidden-layers, and the output
of the network is the our lexical translation score:
tlex(ei, fj|e, f)
= f3 o f2 o f1 o LT(window(ei), window(fj))
f1 and f2 layers use htanh as activation functions,
while f3 is only a linear transformation with no
activation function.
For the distortion td, we could use a lexicalized
distortion model:
td(ai, ai−1|e, f) = td(ai − ai−1|window(fai−,))
which can be computed by a neural network sim-
ilar to the one used to compute lexical transla-
tion scores. If we map jump distance (ai − ai−1)
to B buckets, we can change the length of the
output layer to B, where each dimension in the
output stands for a different bucket of jump dis-
tances. But we found in our initial experiments
on small scale data, lexicalized distortion does not
produce better alignment over the simple jump-
distance based model. So we drop the lexicalized
distortion and reverse to the simple version:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.944707">
td(ai, ai−1|e, f) = td(ai − ai−1) (8)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.99990636">
Vocabulary V of our alignment model consists
of a source vocabulary Ve and a target vocabu-
lary Vf. As in (Collobert et al., 2011), in addition
to real words, each vocabulary contains a special
unknown word symbol (unk) to handle unseen
words; two sentence boundary symbols (s) and
(/s), which are filled into surrounding window
when necessary; furthermore, to handle null align-
ment, we must also include a special null symbol
(null). When fj is null word, we simply fill the
surrounding window with the identical null sym-
bols.
To decode our model, the lexical translation
scores are computed for each source-target word
pair in the sentence pair, which requires going
through the neural network (|e |x |f|) times; af-
ter that, the forward-backward algorithm can be
used to find the viterbi path as in the classic HMM
model.
The majority of tunable parameters in our
model resides in the lookup table LT, which is
a (L x (|Ve |+ |Vf|))-dimension matrix. For a
reasonably large vocabulary, the number is much
smaller than the number of parameters in classic
HMM model, which is in the order of (|Ve|x|Vf|).

The ability to model context is not unique to
our model. In fact, discriminative word alignment
can model contexts by deploying arbitrary features
(Moore, 2005). Different from previous discrim-
inative word alignment, our model does not use
manually engineered features, but learn “features”
automatically from raw words by the neural net-
work. (Berger et al., 1996) use a maximum en-
tropy model to model the bag-of-words context for
word alignment, but their model treats each word
as a distinct feature, which can not leverage the
similarity between words as our model.

our model from raw sentence pairs, they are too
computational demanding as the lexical transla-
tion probabilities must be computed from neu-
ral networks. Hence, we opt for a simpler su-
pervised approach, which learns the model from
sentence pairs with word alignment. As we do
not have a large manually word aligned corpus,
we use traditional word alignment models such as
HMM and IBM model 4 to generate word align-
ment on a large parallel corpus. We obtain bi-
directional alignment by running the usual grow-
diag-final heuristics (Koehn et al., 2003) on uni-
directional results from both directions, and use
the results as our training data. Similar approach
has been taken in speech recognition task (Dahl et
al., 2012), where training data for neural network
model is generated by forced decoding with tradi-
tional Gaussian mixture models.
Tunable parameters in neural network align-
ment model include: word embeddings in lookup
table LT, parameters Wl, bl for linear transforma-
tions in the hidden layers of the neural network,
and distortion parameters sd of jump distance. We
take the following ranking loss with margin as our

et al., 2011) and train word embeddings for source
and target languages from their monolingual cor-
pus respectively. Our vocabularies Vs and Vt con-
tain the most frequent 100,000 words from each
side of the parallel corpus, and all other words are
treated as unknown words. We set word embed-
ding length to 20, window size to 5, and the length
of the only hidden layer to 40. Follow (Turian et
al., 2010), we randomly initialize all parameters
to [-0.1, 0.1], and use stochastic gradient descent
to minimize the ranking loss with a fixed learn-
ing rate 0.01. Note that embedding for null word
in either Ve and Vf cannot be trained from mono-
lingual corpus, and we simply leave them at the
initial value untouched.
Word embeddings from monolingual corpus
learn strong syntactic knowledge of each word,
which is not always desirable for word align-
ment between some language pairs like English
and Chinese. For example, many Chinese words
can act as a verb, noun and adjective without any
change, while their English counter parts are dis-
tinct words with quite different word embeddings
due to their different syntactic roles. Thus we
have to modify the word embeddings in subse-
quent steps according to bilingual data.

the gold alignment path, a− is the highest scor-
ing incorrect alignment path under 0, and so is
model score for alignment path defined in Eq. 5

ter grow-diag-final contains many-to-many links,
which cannot be generated by any path. Our solu-
tion is that for each source word alignment multi-
ple target, we randomly choose one link among all
candidates as the golden link.
Because our multi-layer neural network is in-
herently non-linear and is non-convex, directly
training against the above criteria is unlikely to
yield good results. Instead, we take the following

Training the network against the sentence level
criteria Eq. 5 directly is not efficient. Instead, we
first ignore the distortion parameters and train neu-

the following local pairwise loss:

wrong word pair in the same sentence, and to is as

from the same sentence pair with some margin.

we generate a positive example, and generate two

clear stopping criteria, we simply run the stochas-

neural network have not been trained against the
sentence level criteria Eq. 5. We could achieve
this by re-using the same online training method

now fix the distortion parameters and let the loss
back-propagate through the neural networks. Sen-
tence level training does not take larger context in
modeling word translations, but only to optimize
the parameters regarding to the sentence level loss.
This tuning is quite slow, and it did not improve
alignment on an initial small scale experiment; so,
we skip this step in all subsequent experiment in

We use classic HMM and IBM model 4 as our

sults of classic HMM and IBM model 4 separately.
Since classic HMM, IBM model 4 and our model
are all uni-directional, we use the standard grow-

ferent word alignments. Despite different align-
ment scores, we do not obtain significant differ-
ence in translation performance. In our C-E exper-
iment, we tuned on NIST-03, and tested on NIST-
08. Case-insensitive BLEU-4 scores on NIST-08

IBM-4 and NN alignment results. The result is not
surprising considering our parallel corpus is quite
large, and similar observations have been made in
previous work as (DeNero and Macherey, 2011)
that better alignment quality does not necessarily
lead to better end-to-end result.

From Table 1 we can see higher F-1 score of our
model mainly comes from higher precision, with
recall similar to baseline. By analyzing the results,
we found out that for both baseline and our model,
a large part of missing alignment links involves
stop words like English words “the”, “a”, “it” and
Chinese words “de”. Stop words are inherently
hard to align, which often requires grammatical
judgment unavailable to our models; as they are
also extremely frequent, our model fully learns
their alignment patterns of the baseline models,
including errors. On the other hand, our model
performs better on low-frequency words, espe-
cially proper nouns. Take person names for ex-
ample. Most names are low-frequency words, on
which baseline HMM and IBM4 models show the
“garbage collector” phenomenon. In our model,
different person names have very similar word em-
beddings on both English side and Chinese side,
due to monolingual pre-training; what is more, dif-
ferent person names often appear in similar con-
texts. As our model considers both word embed-
dings and contexts, it learns that English person
names should be aligned to Chinese person names,
which corrects errors of baseline models and leads
to better precision.

ing that larger window size only requires slightly
more parameters in the linear layers. Lastly, it
is worth noticing that our model with no context
(window size 1) performs much worse than set-
tings with larger window size and baseline IBM4.
Our explanation is as follows. Our model uses
the simple jump distance based distortion, which
is weaker than the more sophisticated distortions
in IBM model 4; thus without context, it does not
perform well compared to IBM model 4. With
larger window size, our model is able to produce
more accurate translation scores based on more
contexts, which leads to better alignment despite
the simpler distortions.

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999989272727273">
Following (Collobert et al., 2011), we show some
words together with its nearest neighbors using the
Euclidean distance between their embeddings. As
we can see from Table 2, after bilingual training,
“bad” is no longer in the nearest neighborhood of
“good” as they hold opposite semantic meanings;
the nearest neighbor of “history” is now changed
to its related adjective “historical”. Neighbors of
proper nouns such as person names are relatively
unchanged. For example, neighbors of word
“zetian” are all Chinese names in both settings.
As Chinese language lacks morphology, the single
form and plural form of a noun in English often
correspond to the same Chinese word, thus it is
desirable that the two English words should have
similar word embeddings. While this is true for
relatively frequent nouns such as “lab” and “labs”,
rarer nouns still remain near their monolingual
embeddings as they are only modified a few times
during the bilingual training. As shown in last
column, neighborhood of “laggards” still consists
of other plural forms even after bilingual training.

7 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999934608695652">
In this paper, we explores applying deep neu-
ral network for word alignment task. Our model
integrates a multi-layer neural network into an
HMM-like framework, where context dependent
lexical translation score is computed by neural
network, and distortion is modeled by a sim-
ple jump-distance scheme. Our model is dis-
criminatively trained on bilingual corpus, while
huge monolingual data is used to pre-train word-
embeddings. Experiments on large-scale Chinese-
to-English task show that the proposed method
produces better word alignment results, compared
with both classic HMM model and IBM model 4.
For future work, we will investigate more set-
tings of different hyper-parameters in our model.
Secondly, we want to explore the possibility of
unsupervised training of our neural word align-
ment model, without reliance of alignment result
of other models. Furthermore, our current model
use rather simple distortions; it might be helpful
to use more sophisticated model such as ITG (Wu,
1997), which can be modeled by Recursive Neural
Networks (Socher et al., 2011).

We describe in how we adapt and extend the CD-DNN- HMM (Dahl et al., 2012) method introduced in speech recognition to the HMMbased word alignment model, in which bilingual word embedding is discriminatively learnt to capture lexical translation information, and surrounding words are leveraged to model context information in bilingual sentences.

DNN did not achieve expected success until 2006, when researchers discovered a proper way to intialize and train the deep architectures, which contains two phases: layer-wise unsupervised pretraining and supervised fine tuning. For pretraining, Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) (Hinton et al., 2006), auto-encoding (Bengio et al., 2007) and sparse coding (Lee et al., 2007) are proposed and popularly used. The unsupervised pretraining trains the network one layer at a time, and helps to guide the parameters of the layer towards better regions in parameter space (Bengio, 2009). Followed by fine tuning in this region, DNN is shown to be able to achieve state-of-the-art performance in various area, or even better (Dahl et al., 2012) (Kavukcuoglu et al., 2010). DNN also achieved breakthrough results on the ImageNet dataset for objective recognition (Krizhevsky et al., 2012). For speech recognition, (Dahl et al., 2012) proposed context-dependent neural network with large vocabulary, which achieved 16.0% relative error reduction.

The lookup process is called a lookup layer LT , which is usually the first layer after the input layer in neural network. After words have been transformed to their embeddings, they can be fed into subsequent classical network layers to model highly non-linear relations: zl = fl(Mlzl−1 + bl) (1) where zl is the output of lth layer, Ml is a |zl |x |zl−1 |matrix, bl is a |zl|-length vector, and fl is an activation function. Except for the last layer, fl must be non-linear. Common choices for fl include sigmoid function, hyperbolic function, “hard” hyperbolic function etc. Following (Collobert et al., 2011), we choose “hard” hyperbolic function as our activation function in this work: 1 if x is greater than 1 −1 if x is less than -1 x otherwise (2) If probabilistic interpretation is desired, a softmax layer (Bridle, 1990) can be used to do normalization: i = ezl−1 i zl � |zl |ezl−1 j j=1 The above layers can only handle fixed sized input and output.

If we map jump distance (ai − ai−1) to B buckets, we can change the length of the output layer to B, where each dimension in the output stands for a different bucket of jump distances. But we found in our initial experiments on small scale data, lexicalized distortion does not produce better alignment over the simple jumpdistance based model. So we drop the lexicalized distortion and reverse to the simple version: td(ai, ai−1|e, f) = td(ai − ai−1) (8) Vocabulary V of our alignment model consists of a source vocabulary Ve and a target vocabulary Vf. As in (Collobert et al., 2011), in addition to real words, each vocabulary contains a special unknown word symbol (unk) to handle unseen words; two sentence boundary symbols (s) and (/s), which are filled into surrounding window when necessary; furthermore, to handle null alignment, we must also include a special null symbol (null). When fj is null word, we simply fill the surrounding window with the identical null symbols.

This trending topic, usually referred under the name Deep Learning, is started by ground-breaking papers such as (Hinton et al., 2006), in which innovative training procedures of deep structures are proposed. Unlike shallow learning methods, such as Support Vector Machine, Conditional Random Fields, and Maximum Entropy, which need hand-craft features as input, DNN can learn suitable features (representations) automatically with raw input data, given a training objective. DNN did not achieve expected success until 2006, when researchers discovered a proper way to intialize and train the deep architectures, which contains two phases: layer-wise unsupervised pretraining and supervised fine tuning.

The merits of our approach are illustrated with the experiments described in Section 6, and we conclude our paper in Section 7. 2 Related Work DNN with unsupervised pre-training was firstly introduced by (Hinton et al., 2006) for MNIST digit image classification problem, in which, RBM was introduced as the layer-wise pre-trainer. The layer-wise pre-training phase found a better local maximum for the multi-layer network, thus led to improved performance.

DNN did not achieve expected success until 2006, when researchers discovered a proper way to intialize and train the deep architectures, which contains two phases: layer-wise unsupervised pretraining and supervised fine tuning. For pretraining, Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) (Hinton et al., 2006), auto-encoding (Bengio et al., 2007) and sparse coding (Lee et al., 2007) are proposed and popularly used. The unsupervised pretraining trains the network one layer at a time, and helps to guide the parameters of the layer towards better regions in parameter space (Bengio, 2009). Followed by fine tuning in this region, DNN is shown to be able to achieve state-of-the-art performance in various area, or even better (Dahl et al., 2012) (Kavukcuoglu et al., 2010).

We take the following ranking loss with margin as our training criteria: loss(0) = et al., 2011) and train word embeddings for source and target languages from their monolingual corpus respectively. Our vocabularies Vs and Vt contain the most frequent 100,000 words from each side of the parallel corpus, and all other words are treated as unknown words. We set word embedding length to 20, window size to 5, and the length of the only hidden layer to 40. Follow (Turian et al., 2010), we randomly initialize all parameters to [-0.1, 0.1], and use stochastic gradient descent to minimize the ranking loss with a fixed learning rate 0.01. Note that embedding for null word in either Ve and Vf cannot be trained from monolingual corpus, and we simply leave them at the initial value untouched. Word embeddings from monolingual corpus learn strong syntactic knowledge of each word, which is not always desirable for word alignment between some language pairs like English and Chinese. For example, many Chinese words can act as a verb, noun and adjective without any change, while their </context>

(Niehues and Waibel, 2012) shows that machine translation results can be improved by combining neural language model with n-gram traditional language. (Son et al., 2012) improves translation quality of n-gram translation model by using a bilingual neural language model. (Titov et al., 2012) learns a context-free cross-lingual word embeddings to facilitate cross-lingual information retrieval. For the related works of word alignment, the most popular methods are based on generative models such as IBM Models (Brown et al., 1993) and HMM (Vogel et al., 1996). Discriminative approaches are also proposed to use hand crafted features to improve word alignment. Among them, (Liu et al., 2010) proposed to use phrase and rule pairs to model the context information in a loglinear framework. Unlike previous discriminative methods, in this work, we do not resort to any hand crafted features, but use DNN to induce “features” from raw words. � �_A E)Q zV jiang shi yixiang juda gongcheng will be a mammoth job 167 3 DNN structures for NLP The most important and prevalent features available in NLP are the words themselves.

<context position="10594" citStr="Vogel et al., 1996" startWordPosition="1723" endWordPosition="1726"> As the networks are non-linear and the task specific objectives usually contain many local maximums, special care must be taken in the optimization process to obtain good parameters. Techniques such as layerwise pre-training(Bengio et al., 2007) and many tricks(LeCun et al., 1998) have been developed to train better neural networks. Besides that, neural network training also involves some hyperparameters such as learning rate, the number of hidden layers. We will address these issues in section 4. 4 DNN for word alignment Our DNN word alignment model extends classic HMM word alignment model (Vogel et al., 1996). Given a sentence pair (e, f), HMM word alignment takes the following form: P(a, e|f) = � |e |Plex(ei|fai)Pd(ai − ai−1) (4) i=1 where Plex is the lexical translation probability and Pd is the jump distance distortion probability. One straightforward way to integrate DNN into HMM is to use neural network to compute the emission (lexical translation) probability Plex. Such approach requires a softmax layer in the neural network to normalize over all words in source vocabulary. As vocabulary for natural languages is usually very large, it is prohibitively expensive to do the normalization. Hence</context>
