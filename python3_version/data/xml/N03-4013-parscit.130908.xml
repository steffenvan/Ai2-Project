1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999900285714286">
Our research addresses two central issues of informa-
tion extraction — portability and multilinguality. We
are creating information extraction (IE) systems that take
foreign-language input and generate English tables of ex-
tracted information, and that can be easily adapted to new
extraction tasks. We want to minimize the human in-
tervention required for customization to a new scenario
(type of facts or events of interest), and allow the user
to interact with the system entirely in English. As a
prototype, we have developed the pre-CODIE system,
an experimental Crosss-lingual On-Demand Information
Extraction system that extracts facts or events of interest
from Japanese source text without requiring user knowl-
edge of Japanese.

2 Overview
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999916157894737">
To minimize the customization of the IE system across
scenarios, the extraction procedure of pre-CODIE is
driven by the query from the user. The user starts the
procedure by specifying the type of facts or events of
interest in the form of a narrative description, and then
pre-CODIE customizes itself to the topic by acquiring
extraction patterns based on the user’s description. Pre-
CODIE, as an early attempt at a fully-automated system,
still needs user interaction for template definition and slot
assignment; automating these steps is left as future work.
Pre-CODIE interacts with its user entirely in English;
even for slot assignment of the extraction patterns, the
system translates the Japanese extraction patterns, which
are based on subtrees of a dependency tree (Sudo et al.,
2001), by word-to-word translation of each lexical item in
the patterns. For ease of use, the Japanese extraction pat-
terns are not only translated into English, but also shown
with translated example sentences which match the pat-
tern.

3 System Architecture
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.688617666666667">
Pre-CODIE is implemented as an integration of several
modules, as shown in Figure 1: translation, information
retrieval, pattern acquisition, and extraction.

First, the system takes the narrative description of
the scenario of interest as an English query, and the
Translation module (off-the-shelf IBM King of Transla-
tion system) generates a Japanese query. The IR mod-
ule retrieves a set of relevant documents from Japanese
Mainichi Newspaper from 1995. Then, the Pattern Ac-
quisition module produces a list of extraction patterns
from the relevant document set sorted by their relevance
to the scenario (Sudo et al., 2001). Pre-CODIE asks the
user to assign each placeholder in the patterns to one of
the slots in the template. Finally, the Extraction module
performs the pattern matching with slot-assigned patterns
to each text in the relevant document set and generates a
filled Japanese template, which is translated slot-by-slot
into English for the user.

From the user’s point of view, pre-CODIE works as fol-
lows with the screenshots in Figure 2.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.995734333333333">
1. Query: The user types in the narrative descrip-
tion of the scenario of interest, one phrase in “de-
scription” text-box and more detail optionally given
in “narrative” text-box: “Management Succession:
”
2. Configuration: The user adds and/or deletes the
slots in the template; Add “Person-In”, “Person-
Out”, “Post-In”, “Post-Out”, and “Organization”.
3. Slot Assignment: The user assigns a slot to each

<bodyText confidence="0.838504571428571">
placeholder in the pattern by choosing one of
the slots defined in step 2; Assign “(be-promoted
(PERSON-SBJ))” to “Person-In”.
Also, the user can see the example sentences with
the match of the pattern highlighted. This will make
it easier for the user to understand what each pattern
aims to extract.

4. Extraction: The user gets the extracted template

and repeats this procedure until the user gets the
right template by going back to step 3 to change
and/or add slot assignments, and by going back to
step 2 to delete and/or add slots in the template.
