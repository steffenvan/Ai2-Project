<bodyText confidence="0.9902763">
A compositional account of the semantics
of German prefix verbs in HPSG is out-
lined. We consider only those verbs that
are formed by productive synchronic rules.
Rules are fully productive if they apply to
all base verbs which satisfy a common de-
scription. Prefixes can be polysemous and
have separate, highly underspecified lexical
entries. Adequate bases are determined via
selection restrictions.

1 The Problem
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998348454545455">
Determining the semantics of unknown words which
can be derived from lexicon entries is highly de-
sirable for natural language understanding (Light,
1996). In this paper. I sketch a compositional ac-
count of the semantics of German prefix verbs de-
rived from a verbal base, concentrating on those
verbs that can be generated by a productive word
formation rule. Like (Witte, 1997), I assume that
the meaning of most of these verbs can be derived
compositionally by unifying the semantic represen-
tations of its constituents. Example:

<listItem confidence="0.824354">
(1) durch laufen (&apos;through to run&apos;)
durchlaufen (jto run through&apos;)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.3658245">
This is an instance of a common rule which can be
summarized informally as

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.846402">
When a prefix verb is lexicalized, its meaning fre-
quently shifts due to language change and metaphor-
ical usage (Mayo et al., 1995). For example, &apos;durch-
laufen&apos; is mostly associated with the meaning &amp;quot;pass-
ing through all stages of a process&amp;quot;:

2 ,The Semantics of Prefix Verbs
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99713055">
Frequently, the prefix modifies features of the base
verb such as valency or aspect&apos;. For example, while
&apos;eilen&apos; (&apos;to haste.) is an activity, &apos;etw. durcheilen&apos;
(&apos;to haste through sth.&apos;) is an accomplishment. I
assume that the prefix entry provides a highly un-
derspecified blueprint of the structure of the prefix
verb; therefore. I regard the prefix as the head of the
prefix verb (but see (Bauer, 1990)).
The values for all features of the prefix verb are
obtained from the base verb via structure sharing,
except for basic morphological information and the
information to be modified. In other words, the val-
ues of all unmodified features of the prefix verb are
token identical with the corresponding values of the
base verb.
Most prefixes appear in distinct but semantically
related rules, resulting in polysemous prefixes. For
example, combined with some sta.tive verbs, &apos;durch&apos;
signifies &amp;quot;VERB during a certain period of time&amp;quot;, as
in

(4) durch leben (through&apos; + &apos;live&apos;)
durchleben (live through!)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998925933333334">
Specifying the set of adequate bases implicitly by
selection restrictions allows to elegantly capture gen-
eralizations. For example, we can specify at the
feature structure for verbs of motion that they can
only combine with the instance of !durch&apos; denoting
&amp;quot;VERB through a space&amp;quot;.
The productivity of a word formation rule is
a complex notion (Kastovsk3r, 1986: Bauer, 1988;
Mayo et al., 1995). For our purposes, a rule is pro-
ductive if it applies to all bases which satisfy a com-
mon description such as &amp;quot;state&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;transitive verb&amp;quot;.
A rule only provides patterns for analogical forma-
&apos;Here. aspect denotes certain general verb classes
(Binnick. 1992; Comrie. 1992) such as state, activity,
accomplishment, and achievement (Vendler, 1957).

3 Prefix Semantics in HPSG
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999941125">
The main advantage of HPSG (Head Driven Phrase
Structure Grammar, (Pollard and Sag, 1994), for
German see e.g.(Kathol, 1995)) is that it is both a
formalism with strong ties to logic and knowledge
representation and a linguistic theory. Much re-
search in HPSG focuses on the structure of the lexi-
con. e.g. (Davis, 1997). However, work on semantics
and morphology in HPSG is relatively scarce.
</bodyText>

3.1 Previous Work
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99609003030303">
Most HPSG work on German affixation focuses on
the suffix -bar, which can combine with verbs, most
of them transitive, to form an adjective.
(Krieger and Nerbonne, 1992) (KN) assign sepa-
rate lexical entries to affixes and express selection
restrictions by typing and subcategorization frames.
In their model, -bar is of sort bar-stiff and subcate-
gorizes for verbs of sort bar-verb to form adjectives
of sort bar-comp-adj. Complex words have a headed
binary structure, with the affix as head. In keeping
with the HPSG Semantics Principle, the semantics
of the complex word is structure shared with the
semantics of the head.
(Riehemann, 1993) found that subcategorization
frames were incompatible with her data. Instead
of a word syntactic approach with separate lexical
entries for affixes, she describes the formation of bar-
adjectives via a lexical inheritance hierarchy of sorts.
Different sorts correspond to different types of verbal
bases (transitive, dative, etc.). New adjectives are
formed in analogy to existing ones.
Although Riehemann&apos;s approach is very elegant,
it is not adequate for verb prefixes. Most prefixes
can be separated from the verb depending on their
phonological leve1.2 Example:
(5) Ich mache die Tiir zu. (&apos;I close the door&apos;:
zumachen = &apos;to close&apos;)
Therefore, a word syntactic approach and separate
lexical entries for verb prefixes may well be adequate.
(Witte, 1997) also advocates a word syntactic ap-
proach. His semantic representation relies on (Davis,
1997). (Light, 1996) bases his semantic representa-
tions on first order logic, but he does not use HPSG.

tures of verb prefixes. Each prefix p is assigned a sort
p with subsorts p1 ,p, for each potential mean-
ing. Relevant verb classes, such as semantic fields or
Vendler classes, are also specified using sorts.
Following KN, I assume that the prefix is the head
of complex affix words, but like Riehemann, I do not
assume a binary structure. The internal structure of
a complex derived word is given in Fig. 2. Morpho-
logical information is given at the feature MORPII.
MOR.PHILEVEL specifies separability (1 — &apos;Insepara-
ble, 2 — separable). MORPHIDTRS the internal struc-
ture, and MORPHIBASE the base form.
Each verb has a complex feature PREFIX located
at SYNSENIILOCICAT. For each prefix p, the value
of the subfeature PREFIXIp points to the adequate
prefix meaning. For example, if the instance of
&apos;durch&apos; corresponding to (2) is labelled durch,_1, we
get PR.EFIXIDURCH: 1 in the lexical entry for &apos;eilen&apos;.
A verb can only combine with prefixes for which
an instance is specified at PREFIX. Regarding se-
mantics. we focus on aspectual classes. The se-
mantic framework chosen here is Lexical Concep-
tual Structure, which has been applied successfully
to the interface between morphology and lexical se-
mantics by e.g. (Rappaport Hovav and Levin, in
press). The representation of Vendler classes is
adapted from (Van Valin, 1990). Class is specified
at SYNSEMILOCICONTENTICLASS.
Prefix entries are heavily underspecified. For ex-
ample, the entry for &apos;durch&apos; can be derived from
Fig. 2 by deleting all information specific to
the comPlement &apos;ellen&apos;. except for the value of
PREFIXIDURCH. The semantics of the complex word
is composed at the head and then structure shared
with the whole word, in accordance with the Seman-
tics Principle. A prefix can only be combined with
verbs with an adequate feature value at PREFIX.

<context position="769" citStr="Light, 1996" startWordPosition="109" endWordPosition="110">53115 Bonn mwo@as11.ikp.uni-bonn.de Abstract A compositional account of the semantics of German prefix verbs in HPSG is outlined. We consider only those verbs that are formed by productive synchronic rules. Rules are fully productive if they apply to all base verbs which satisfy a common description. Prefixes can be polysemous and have separate, highly underspecified lexical entries. Adequate bases are determined via selection restrictions. 1 The Problem Determining the semantics of unknown words which can be derived from lexicon entries is highly desirable for natural language understanding (Light, 1996). In this paper. I sketch a compositional account of the semantics of German prefix verbs derived from a verbal base, concentrating on those verbs that can be generated by a productive word formation rule. Like (Witte, 1997), I assume that the meaning of most of these verbs can be derived compositionally by unifying the semantic representations of its constituents. Example: (1) durch laufen (&apos;through to run&apos;) durchlaufen (jto run through&apos;) This is an instance of a common rule which can be summarized informally as (2) &apos;durch&apos; VERBHmotion,-Fagentivej VERB through a space When a prefix verb is le</context>

Like (Witte, 1997), I assume that the meaning of most of these verbs can be derived compositionally by unifying the semantic representations of its constituents. Example: (1) durch laufen (&apos;through to run&apos;) durchlaufen (jto run through&apos;) This is an instance of a common rule which can be summarized informally as (2) &apos;durch&apos; VERBHmotion,-Fagentivej VERB through a space When a prefix verb is lexicalized, its meaning frequently shifts due to language change and metaphorical usage (Mayo et al., 1995). For example, &apos;durchlaufen&apos; is mostly associated with the meaning &amp;quot;passing through all stages of a process&amp;quot;: (3) Er durchlauft die Schulung. He passes through the training. 2 ,The Semantics of Prefix Verbs Frequently, the prefix modifies features of the base verb such as valency or aspect&apos;. For example, while &apos;eilen&apos; (&apos;to haste.) is an activity, &apos;etw. durcheilen&apos; (&apos;to haste through sth.&apos;) is an accomplishment. I assume that the prefix entry provides a highly underspecified blueprint of the structure of the prefix verb; therefore. I regard the prefix as the head of the prefix verb (but see (Ba</context>

For example, combined with some sta.tive verbs, &apos;durch&apos; signifies &amp;quot;VERB during a certain period of time&amp;quot;, as in (4) durch leben (through&apos; + &apos;live&apos;) durchleben (live through!) Specifying the set of adequate bases implicitly by selection restrictions allows to elegantly capture generalizations. For example, we can specify at the feature structure for verbs of motion that they can only combine with the instance of !durch&apos; denoting &amp;quot;VERB through a space&amp;quot;. The productivity of a word formation rule is a complex notion (Kastovsk3r, 1986: Bauer, 1988; Mayo et al., 1995). For our purposes, a rule is productive if it applies to all bases which satisfy a common description such as &amp;quot;state&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;transitive verb&amp;quot;.
