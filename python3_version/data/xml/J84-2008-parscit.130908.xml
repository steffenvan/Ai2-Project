Pragmatics Documentation Center
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99962584">
A Pragmatics Documentation Center is being organized
at the University of Antwerp (UIA), Belgium. Its first
task will be to compile an annotated bibliography of
pragmatics from 1938 through 1985. This bibliography
will be a completely revised, integrated, expanded, and
updated version of J. Verschueren, 1978, Pragmatics: An
Annotated Bibliography (John Benjamins, Amsterdam: xvi
+ 270 pp.) and the five supplements that have appeared
in the Journal of Pragmatics (1978-1982) .
The bibliography is intended to cover the field of
pragmatics in its widest sense, including not only studies
dealing with speech acts, presuppositions, implicatures,
and the like, but also some aspects of artificial intelli-
gence, many forms of anthropological, sociolinguistics,
psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic research, most forms
of discourse analysis and conversational analysis, and
various applications of these various domains of inquiry.
The selection of items from this broad range of interests
will be based on rather strict boundary criteria that are,
however, too complex to explain in this limited space.
Everyone who is, has been, or will be active in any of
the areas cited is kindly invited, in order to facilitate this
compilation, to send a copy of their past and future
publications (in any language, with full bibliographical
reference) to

A Decade Outlook on Research Opportunities in
the Behavioral and Social Sciences
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.998721466666667">
The Committee on Basic Research in the Behavioral and
Social Sciences is a National Research Council unit
established in 1980 to assess and improve the vitality of
research in behavioral and social sciences. The first
Committee report, Behavioral and Social Science
Research: A National Resource (1982), was a general
statement of the scientific value, significance, and social
utility of behavioral and social science research. A
second Committee report, currently in preparation,
derives from a 1983 symposium on &amp;quot;Knowledge in Social
and Behavioral Science: Discoveries and Trends over
Fifty Years&amp;quot;.
These two Committee projects concentrated on the
past record and present dimensions of behavioral and
social science. There is now a national commitment to
expand the future scientific and technological base.
Promising new research directions must be canvassed,
resources needed to foster prospective advances must be
defined and evaluated, and priorities for additional scien-
tific research spending must be developed and rigorously
scrutinized. These processes are now occurring in nearly
every major branch of science.
The Committee has therefore agreed to undertake a
Decade Outlook on Research Opportunities in the
Behavioral and Social Sciences, with the formal partic-
ipation of the National Research Council&apos;s Commission
on Behavioral and Social Sciences and Education, the
Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences,
and the Social Science Research Council. This project,
supported by the National Science Foundation, the
Russell Sage Foundation, and other sponsors, will be
completed in 1986.
The Decade Outlook will study scientific frontiers,
leading research questions, and new resources needed
over the next decade, roughly 1986-1995, for rapid
progress on fundamental problems in the behavioral and
social sciences. The final report is to contain recommen-
dations for research resources, facilities, and programs
that may provide a high level of returns to fundamental
knowledge. Research areas and new resource needs will
be identified by the Committee with substantial advice
from many distinguished senior level, mid-career, and
promising younger scientists.
The Committee invites your ideas on leading research
questions for the next ten years and on new resources
