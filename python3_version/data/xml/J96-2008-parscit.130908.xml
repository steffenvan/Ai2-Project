This slim text in linguistic semantics addresses a topic of wide relevance for the seman-
tics of natural language understanding: the interpretation of past-tense expressions.
The book&apos;s title is perhaps overly general, in that neither present-tense nor adverbial
reference to present time is handled (nor is future, or other modal auxiliaries). What is
addressed is the fundamental problem of integrating a compositional approach to the
computation of temporal aspect with that of computing temporal relations of inclu-
sion and precedence among the situations described in a discourse. The treatment of
aspect includes lexical aspect of verbs, perfect and progressive grammatical markers
of aspect, and the effects of certain semantic properties of verb argumentsâ€”such as
definiteness or generic reference.
A fundamental characteristic of the author&apos;s approach is to handle interpretation
of tense and aspect in distinct modules. Though this is not a novel idea, an unusually
broad range of issues is treated. Ter Meulen integrates a situation-semantics-based
treatment of the situations that clauses describe with a dynamic method for comput-
ing temporal relation trees; immediate dominance represents temporal inclusion and
precedence represents temporal precedence. Nodes in the tree representing situations
are open or closed, thus allowing or blocking information flow, depending on the
aspect of the associated clause.
Ter Meulen refers to the method for constructing the temporal trees (Dynamic
Aspect Trees, or DATs), as an algorithm. However, parts of the &amp;quot;algorithm&amp;quot; depend
on computations that are not dealt with in any detail. For example, where a new
node is added to a DAT can depend on enforcing consistency of rather general types
of lexical and commonsense inference. Rather than focusing on a specific unsolved
problem or set of problems, the book presents a general approach to a wide range
of data, and does so very concisely. As a result, there are too few examples and too
little discussion of background literature for the book to serve as an introduction to the
complex issues of aspect and tense. For readers who do not need such an introduction,
examples are worked through in sufficient detail to indicate clearly how situation
types are represented, how these representations are composed from the semantic
representations of linguistic constituents, and how these type differences affect DAT
construction.
Chapter 1, on the aspectual classes, relies on Vendler&apos;s (1967) classic categoriza-
tion of events, but adopts terminology borrowed from Karttunen (1973): what Vendler
calls achievements are plugs, accomplishments are filters, and activities are holes. The
motivation for this terminology reflects the author&apos;s concern with what she refers to
as the flow of information, meaning essentially how to determine what components

of the current context representation are updated by each subsequent utterance. Ref-
erence to one of the three event categories dynamically updates the current DAT with
a new node, whereas states, which are discussed later (especially in Chapter 4), add
information to existing nodes. Overall, this introductory chapter suffers from an at-
tempt to introduce an abstract representation and reasoning mechanism by means of
relatively few examples, and prior to clear definitions of terminology (for example,
the term perspective, which has many different uses in the literature but is not clarified
until Chapter 5).
Chapter 2 is devoted to a detailed analysis of aspectual verbs (e.g., start, stop, keep)
and along the way introduces the representation of the semantic types of complete
clauses, or parametric types in the case of partial information. However, it is not
entirely clear why a chapter is devoted to aspectual verbs at this point, as opposed to a
general chapter on the semantic composition of aspectual types. Much of the chapter is
an interesting discussion drawing a parallel between existential versus quantificational
NPs, and two classes of aspectual verbs having existential versus quantificational force.
This discussion is primarily descriptive, despite a hint in Chapter 6 that it might
provide a basis for explaining certain semantic curiosities.
Chapters 3 through 5 are the intellectual as well as literal heart of the book, provid-
ing a comprehensive overview of DATs. Chapter 3 works through numerous examples
to show how DAT updating varies, depending on whether the current clause describes
an achievement (plug), accomplishment (filter), activity (hole), or state (sticker). It is
the strongest chapter in its expository style, content, and relation to the rest of the
book. An activity, by definition homogeneous, is a hole in that the current state of in-
formation flow is updated by continuing rather than altering the current branch in the
tree. That is, a new daughter node (representing temporal inclusion, a partial order)
is added to the tree. An achievement is a plug, meaning an instantaneous event with
no internal structure, and thus updates a DAT with a new sister node (representing
temporal precedence, a strict partial order) to the current node. Accomplishments are
filters, which in terms of information flow are plugs or holes, depending on further
unspecified inference. Filters are ter Meulen&apos;s means of representing the lack of ho-
mogeneity in the internal structure of accomplishments; an accomplishment is a non-
homogeneous event consisting of some (perhaps) homogeneous region after which the
flow of information might shift (or make a transition [Passonneau 1988], or culminate
[Moens and Steedman 1988]).
Chapter 4 is an important complement to Chapter 3, dealing with various types of
states (e.g., transient states, such as generally indicated by the progressive, as opposed
to descriptions of more permanent properties, such as generic statements) and how
different kinds of stative information percolate differently through a DAT. Chapter 5
completes the overview of DATs by defining the author&apos;s notion of perspective, but the
issues raised here are not as fully developed. Briefly, holes preserve perspective, plugs
trigger perspective shifts. Flashbacks, also treated in this chapter, involve temporarily
converting an existing plug to a hole and then back again.
Chapter 6 presents a detailed fragment of English with formal definitions of op-
erations such as the various types of DAT updates that are described in the three
preceding chapters. At the end of the chapter, the author introduces a puzzle presum-
ably related to some of the issues discussed in Chapter 2: an unexplained semantic
asymmetry of verbs with or without a goal argument, and the difference in accept-
ability of existential arguments (compare A tree grew out of every acorn with *An acorn
grew into every tree), but this is not expanded upon. Chapter 7 is a very brief discussion
of the relation between the type of semantic investigation pursued here and cognitive
science.

interrupted, it is a useful resource giving an interesting and comprehensive framework
for readers familiar with the topic.
