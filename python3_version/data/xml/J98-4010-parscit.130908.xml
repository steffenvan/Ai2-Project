This collection is a very welcome addition to the literature on automatic speech syn-
thesis, also known as &amp;quot;text-to-speech&amp;quot; (TTS). It has been more than a decade since a
comprehensive, edited collection of chapters on this topic has been published. Because
much has changed in TTS research over the last ten years, this text will prove very
useful to workers in the field. Along with Dutoit&apos;s recent book (An Introduction to Text-
to-Speech Synthesis [1997], also published by Kluwer), it is essential reading for anyone
serious about TTS research. (Other recent works have included chapters on TTS, but
their main focus has been on other aspects of speech processing, and thus the TTS de-
tails there are far fewer. While Bailly and Benoit&apos;s collection Talking Machines [1992] has
synthesis as its sole focus, it derives from numerous presentations at a workshop and
suffers accordingly due to its many uneven short chapters.) A more direct comparison
can be made to Allen, Hunnicutt, and Klatt&apos;s book on MITalk (1987), especially as both
that book and the one currently under review describe in detail specific TTS systems
developed at two of the major research centres involved in speech synthesis over the
years. As the foreword of the present book notes, the MITalk system was largely based
on morphological decomposition of words and synthesis via a Klatt formant architec-
ture, while the modular Bell system is distinguished by its regular relations for text
analysis, its use of concatenation of diphone units, and its emphasis on the importance
of careful selection of texts and recording conditions.
While they cover similar ground, the newer Sproat book is quite different from
Dutoit&apos;s. It has seven authors, all contributors to the Bell Labs system that is described
in detail in the book. Often in multiauthor books, one finds a significant unevenness
in coverage and style across chapters due to lack of coordination among the authors.
This is much less apparent in Sproat&apos;s book, because all authors worked at the same
lab and because one author (van Santen) was involved in seven of the chapters; at
least one of the two principal authors (Sproat and van Santen) contributed to all nine
chapters.
Further distinguishing this book is its emphasis on multilingual TTS: the Bell
system exists for ten diverse languages, and the book provides many specific examples
of interesting problems in different languages. While several multilingual synthesizers
are available commercially, most technical literature has focused on one language at a
time. Given that all speech synthesis is based on the same human speech production
mechanism and that the world&apos;s languages share many aspects of phonetics, it is
prudent to examine how a uniform methodology can be applied to many different
languages for TTS. Unlike speech coders, which normally function equally well for all
languages without adjustment, speech recognizers and synthesizers necessarily need
training for individual languages. One of the foci of this book is minimizing the work to

be repeated when developing US for another language. While many examples from
different languages shown in the book help to demonstrate the Bell Labs system&apos;s
flexibility, most of the book focuses on English (indeed, the only evaluation is given
for English, but their new &amp;quot;gentex&amp;quot; text analysis is not used for English).
The book begins with a very frank foreword by Louis Pols, noting that the Bell Labs
method shares with Dutoit&apos;s the concatenative approach to TTS by chaining together
stored speech units. Pols points out that such a method is not very flexible in terms of
simulating new voices, and may have difficulties adding emotions to synthetic voices.
The introductory Chapter 1 notes that an ultimate US system, one indistinguishable
from a human speaker, still awaits significant research in articulatory synthesis; in the
meantime, however, more practical systems have been increasingly following the lines
of work described in this book.
The casual reader may find difficulty with Chapter 2, which describes statistical
methods and finite-state automata that are needed to understand fully much of the
detail in ensuing chapters. I would advise many readers to skip to Section 2.6, and to
go back to the rest of Chapter 2 only when needed to better understand notation from
later chapters. While many later examples need a good understanding of Chapter 2,
most of the book can be read well without dwelling too long here.
The longest chapter at 50 pages, Chapter 3 compares the traditional TTS approach
(e.g., MITalk) with the Bell Labs method, emphasizing the advantages of the new
approach especially for a modular and multilingual system. Very specific and detailed
examples from seven languages are given. The important issue of rule-based versus
automatic learning is addressed: as in speech recognition (but less so for TTS), there has
been a significant trend toward use of automatic training, as opposed to labor-intensive
development of system rules by experts. The authors correctly conclude that purely
automatic learning systems are doomed to inferior performance; as in recognition,
a combination of phonetic and linguistic structure with proper use of statistics will
eventually lead to improved results in synthesis.
Chapter 4 covers issues of text analysis dealing with accentuation, disambiguation
of homographs, and prediction of boundaries of prosodic phrases. Chapters 5 and 6
cover the assignment of timing and intonation for US. It is assumed that one can ob-
tain a reasonably sized inventory of acoustic units to concatenate (e.g., no more than
several thousand units, since individual speakers would be stressed to utter more at
a time), from which natural-sounding speech of any text is feasible. Issues of discov-
ering which linguistic factors affect intonation and their interactions are discussed in
detail. The tone sequence approach (e.g., from Pierrehumbert [1981]) is compared to
superposition (e.g., from Fujisaki [Fujisaki, Ljungqvist, and Murata 1993]). The latter is
adopted and modified, although the authors admit that applying it to tone languages
would be a challenge.
Ways to concatenate acoustic units—from rule-based (e.g., MITalk) to concatena-
tive (e.g., PSOLA [Hamon, Moulines, and Charpentier 1989])—are treated in Chap-
ter 7. The major difficulty with the latter, adopted, method is the large number of
units needed to handle all the variations of coarticulation. Proper generation of acous-
tic unit inventories requires great care in token selection and excision, which is again
described in detail.
Formal evaluation methods are examined in Chapter 8, which present problems
due to the many variables involved in judging intelligibility and naturalness for TTS
with many parameters. The book ends with a useful discussion of the limitations of
current technology and directions where future research needs to make progress.
The book has ample indices, both of subjects and authors, and an extensive list of
references. Its physical layout makes the book easy to read, and many figures and ta-

bles also help the reader. An accompanying Web site (httpillwww.bell-labs.comlprojectItts)
provides access to audio versions of the synthetic speech. (Technically, the book&apos;s only
flaw is an occasional problem in spacing words equally.) In summary, I recommend this
book strongly to anyone wanting a detailed description of current ways to do text-to-
speech synthesis. It will be most useful to TTS researchers, but people knowledgeable
about other technical aspects of speech communication will also find it useful. For
a course on speech synthesis, I would recommend a combination of the Sproat and
Dutoit books. The Sproat book is more detailed on issues of natural language process-
ing, while Dutoit covers acoustic aspects more comprehensively. These two synthesis
books will provide the standards in TTS for the next several years.
