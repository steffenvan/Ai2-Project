The ACL-MIT Series will offer books of high quality in the field of
natural language processing, including human and machine speech
production and understanding. It will cover a wide range of topics,
both theoretical and applied, which should interest researchers not
only in computational linguistics, but also in computer science and in
formal linguistics.
The Series will include specially commissioned volumes, research
monographs, textbooks, and on occasion, collections of high quality
papers with clear unifying themes compiled under the editorship of
distinguished researchers.
The MIT Press publishes the ACL journal, Computational Linguis-
tics. The Press also has a strong list in formal linguistics, and pub-
lishes the journal, Linguistic Inquiry.

For Personal Memberships; Institutions Subscribe to Computational Linguistics through MIT Press
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9996973">
Personal membership in the Association for Computational Linguistics is for the calendar year, regardless of when it starts.
Membership includes a full year of the ACL journal Computational Linguistics, reduced registration at most ACL-sponsored
conferences, and discounts on ACL-sponsored publications. Institutional memberships were discontinued in 1988 when MIT Press
began publishing the journal; instead, institutions should subscribe to the journal through MIT Press Journals, 55 Hayward Street,
Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; 617:253-2889. Back issues and proceedings are available only from the ACL Office, except that
institutions should backorder journals from 1988 on through MIT Press. An order form is on the other side of this statement. The
change in publishing required establishing a late payment for renewals made after 15 March, because of the extra mailing and
handling costs. The late payment fee does not apply to new members. Dues and back order payments can be made in Europe and
Japan as well as the U.S.; read the directions under the heading PAYMENT below carefully. Identify your institutional affiliation if it
is not part of your address. Also please provide your telephone number and computer network address.

Guidelines for Submissions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.888061666666667">
Manuscripts to Computational Linguistics should be submitted on letter-size paper (8.5 by 11 inches,
or A4), double-spaced throughout, including footnotes and references. The paper should begin with
an informative abstract of approximately 150-250 words. Manuscripts must be written in English.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.935359">
Submissions may be made in any of the following categories:
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.896017952380952">
PAPER: This category includes contributions that report significant new research results in
computational linguistics or that provide critical reviews of the literature on a particular topic. The
length of a paper depends on its content, but we suggest that manuscripts be limited to forty
double-spaced pages. That is the equivalent of twelve journal pages. Each paper is fully refereed,
being read by at least two members of the editorial board and usually by an additional expert in the
particular subject area.
The submission of an article to CL for refereeing means that the author certifies the manuscript
is not copyrighted; nor has it been published or submitted for publication to another refereed
journal. If any version of the paper has appeared, or will appear, in a non-refereed publication, the
details of such publication must be made known to the Editor at the time of submission. The final
version of a paper tentatively accepted for publication must be accompanied by a Copyright
Transfer Agreement signed by all of the authors or, in the case of a &amp;quot;work for hire,&amp;quot; by the
employer. This written transfer is necessary under the 1978 U.S. Copyright law.
TECHNICAL CORRESPONDENCE: This category includes short articles reporting preliminary
results of some project in progress, or the results of other studies of interest to the readership.
Technical correspondences should not generally exceed eight double-spaced pages. Each technical
correspondence is reviewed by at least two members of the editorial board before acceptance.
LETTERS TO THE EDITOR: This includes statements of opinion on issues relevant to the
readership. The Editor and the editorial board will evaluate the appropriateness of these contribu-
tions for inclusion.
Five copies of papers, technical correspondences, and letters should be sent to the Editor:

It will cover a wide range of topics, both theoretical and applied, which should interest researchers not only in computational linguistics, but also in computer science and in formal linguistics. The Series will include specially commissioned volumes, research monographs, textbooks, and on occasion, collections of high quality papers with clear unifying themes compiled under the editorship of distinguished researchers.</abstract>

<author confidence="0.76572">to Linguistics be submitted on letter-size paper</author>
<abstract confidence="0.995974652173913">or A4), double-spaced throughout, including footnotes and references. The paper should begin with an informative abstract of approximately 150-250 words. Manuscripts must be written in English. Submissions may be made in any of the following categories: category includes contributions that report significant new research results in computational linguistics or that provide critical reviews of the literature on a particular topic. The length of a paper depends on its content, but we suggest that manuscripts be limited to forty double-spaced pages. That is the equivalent of twelve journal pages. Each paper is fully refereed, being read by at least two members of the editorial board and usually by an additional expert in the particular subject area. The submission of an article to CL for refereeing means that the author certifies the manuscript is not copyrighted; nor has it been published or submitted for publication to another refereed journal. If any version of the paper has appeared, or will appear, in a non-refereed publication, the details of such publication must be made known to the Editor at the time of submission. The final version of a paper tentatively accepted for publication must be accompanied by a Copyright Transfer Agreement signed by all of the authors or, in the case of a &amp;quot;work for hire,&amp;quot; by the employer. This written transfer is necessary under the 1978 U.S. Copyright law. CORRESPONDENCE: category includes short articles reporting preliminary results of some project in progress, or the results of other studies of interest to the readership. Technical correspondences should not generally exceed eight double-spaced pages. Each technical correspondence is reviewed by at least two members of the editorial board before acceptance. TO THE EDITOR: includes statements of opinion on issues relevant to the readership. The Editor and the editorial board will evaluate the appropriateness of these contributions for inclusion.</abstract>
