This paper describes an approach to ex-
tract the aspectual information of Japanese
verb phrases from a monolingual corpus.
We classify verbs into six categories by
means of the aspectual features which are
defined on the basis of the possibility of
co-occurrence with aspectual forms and ad-
verbs. A unique category could be identi-
fied for 96% of the target verbs. To evalu-
ate the result of the experiment, we exam-
ined the meaning of -teiru which is one of
the most fundamental aspectual markers in
Japanese, and obtained the correct recog-
nition score of 71% for the 200 sentences.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.963411568627451">
Aspect refers to the internal temporal structure of
events and is distinguished from tense, which has a
deictic element in it, of reference to a point of time
anchored by the speaker&apos;s utterance. There is a vo-
luminous literature on aspect within linguistics and
philosophy. Recently, computational linguists also
have joined in the act within the context of machine
translation or text understanding etc. For example,
consider the following Japanese sentences (quoted
from (Gunji, 1992)).
(a). Ken-wa ima tonarino heya-de kimono-wo ki-te-i-ru.
Ken-TOP now next room-LOC kimono-ACC put-
on-PRES
&apos;Ken is now putting on kimono in the next room.&apos;
(b). Ken-wa kesa-kara zutto ano kimono-wo ki-te-i-ru.
Ken-TOP this morning-since always that kimono-
ACC wear-PRES
&apos;Ken has been wearing that kimono since this morn-
ing.&apos;
Ken-wa ano kimono-wo san-nen maeni ki-te-i-ru.
Ken-TOP that kimono-ACC three-year before
wear-PRES
&apos;Ken has the experience of wearing that kimono
three years ago.&apos;
Notice that English translations use separate lex-
ical items (put on for (a) and wear for (b), (c))
and different aspectual configurations (the progres-
sive for (a), the perfect progressive for (b), and an-
other for (c)), while all Japanese sentences contain
the same verbal form ki-te-i-ru. Thus, when the sys-
tem tries to translate these sentences, it must be
aware of the difference among them.
This paper describes an approach to extract the
aspectual information of Japanese verb phrases from
a monolingual corpus. In the next section, we will
classify Japanese verbs into six categories by means
of aspectual features following the framework of
(Bennett et al., 1990). The aspectual forms land
adverbs are defined as the functions which operate
on verbs&apos; aspectual features and changes their val-
ues. By using the constraints of the applicability of
the functions, we can identify a unique category for
each verb automatically. If one can acquire aspec-
tual properties of verbs properly and know how the
other constituents in a sentence operate on them,
then the aspectual meaning of the whole sentence
will be determined monotonically. To evaluate the
result of the experiment, we will examine the mean-
ing of -teiru which is one of the most fundamental
aspectual forms, since the classification itself is dif-
ficult to evaluate objectively.

2 Realization Process of Aspectual
Meaning
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9984632">
We consider that the whole aspectual meaning of
verb phrases is determined in the following order:
verbs arguments —■ adverbs aspect ual
forms. Adverbs and aspectual forms are defined
as indicators of such cognitive processes as &amp;quot;zoom-
ing&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;focusing&amp;quot; which operate on the time-line
representation. They are similar to the notions &amp;quot;as-
pectual coercion&amp;quot; (Moens and Steedman, 1988) or
&apos;The term &amp;quot;form&amp;quot; refers to grammatical morphemes
which are defined in terms of derivation. In this paper,
we refer to the aspectual morphemes which follow verbs
as &amp;quot;aspectual forms&amp;quot;, including compound verbs such as
-hazimeru(begin). suffixes with epenthetic -te such as -
teiru, and aspectual nominals such as -bakari(just now)
etc.

2.1 Aspectual Categories of Verbs
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999921666666667">
A number of aspectually oriented lexical-semantic
representations have been proposed. We adopt
and extend the feature-based framework proposed
by (Bennett et al., 1990) in the spirit of (Moens
and Steedman, 1988). They uses three features:
±dynamic, ±telic, and ±atomic. We add two more
features: ±process and ±gradual.
The feature dynamicity distinguishes between
states(—d) and events(+d), and atomicity dis-
tinguishes between point events(+a) and extended
events(—a). The duration described by verbs is
twofold: an ongoing process and a consequent state.
The feature process concerns an ongoing process
and distinguishes whether events described by verbs
have the duration for which some actions unfold.
The feature telicity distinguishes between culmi-
native events(+t) and nonculminative events(—t).
It presupposes a process. The feature graduality
characterizes events in which some kind of change is
included and the change gradually develops.
We can classify verbs by means of different com-
binations of the five features. Since there are depen-
dences between features, only subsets of the corn-
binatorially possible configurations of features are
defined as shown in the Table 1.
In the Table 1, 1.stative verbs are those that
are not dynamic. 2.atomic verbs are those that
express an atomic event. 3.resultative verbs ex-
press a punctual event followed by a new state which
holds over some interval of time. 4.process+result
verbs are those that express a complex situation
consisting of a process which culminates in a new
state. 5.non-gradual process verbs are those
that express only processes and not changes of state.
6.gradual process verbs are those that have grad-
uality. Although the verbs of the categories 5 and
6 don&apos;t contain telicity, the arguments of the verbs
or some kinds of adverbs can set up the endpoint of
the process as discussed later. In Vendlerian classi-
fication, states correspond to 1, achievements to 2
and 3, accomplishments to 4 and 6, activities to 5,
respectively (Vendler, 1957).

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998675">
2.2 Arguments
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999992545454546">
Tenny points out that internal argument of a verb
can be defined as that which temporally delimits or
measures out the event (Tenny, 1994).
The direct internal argument can aspectually
&amp;quot;measure out the event&amp;quot; to which the verb refers. To
clarify what is meant by -mesuring-out&amp;quot;, she gives
examples of three kinds of measuring-out: incremen-
tal theme verbs (eat an apple, build a house etc.),
change-of-state verbs (ripen the fruit etc.) and path
objects of route verbs (climbed the ladder, play a
sonata etc.).
On the other hand, the indirect internal argument
can provide a temporal terminus for the event de-
scribed by the verb. The terminus causes the event
to be delimited as in push the car to a gas station.
There is only one kind of internal argument, in terms
of thematic roles, that does provide an event termi-
nus, and that is a goal.
In terms of the current framework, both of them
add the telicity to the verb which does not inherently
contain the telicity. They play a role of framing the
interval on which the focus should be brought.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997649">
2.3 Adverbs
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999160083333333">
In general, adverbs focus on the subpart of the event
described by a verb and give a more detailed de-
scription. According to the discussion in (Moriyama,
1988), adverbs can be classified as follows in terms
of the subpart on which they focus.
Processes modifiers modify verbs which have
process (+p). This class includes reduplicative ono-
matopoeia such as gasagasa, batabata, suisui, ses-
seto, butubutu, etc., which are expressing sound or
manner of directed motion, and rate adverbs such
as yukkuri(slowly), tebayaku(quickly), etc., which ex-
press the speed of motions. They focus on the on-
going process of events described by verbs.
Gradual change indicators express the
progress of change of state, such as dandan (grad-
ually), sukosizutu (little by little), jojoni (gradually),
dondon (constantly), sidaini (by degrees), etc., which
modify gradual process verbs (+g) and focus on the
process.
Continuous adverbs are those that can mod-
ify both states verbs ( —d) and process verbs (+p),
such as zutto(for a long time). itumademo(forever),
etc. They express a continuance of an event or a
maintenance of a state.

<bodyText confidence="0.999716">
Atomic adverbs make any events instantaneous,
such as satto, ponto, gatatto, potarito, syunkan, etc.,
which express instantaneous sound emission or an
instant. When these adverbs co-occur with verbs,
the events are understood as instantaneous. This
doesn&apos;t necessarily imply that the verb itself is in-
stantaneous.
Quantity regulators measure out events, such
as gokiro aruku(walk 5km), gojikan seizasita(sit
straight for 5 hours), etc. These include time, dis-
tance, and any quantity of contents.
End state modifiers express the consequent
state of events, such as mapputatuni(into two ex-
act halves), konagonani(into pieces), pechankoni(be
flat), barabarani(come apart), etc. They focus on
the resultant state.
So far we have described adverbs which concern a
single event, but some adverbs regulate the multiple
events which involves iteration of a single event. By
iteration, the whole process of a collective event can
be taken up regardless of the inherent features of
verbs.
There are two kinds of Repetition adverbs:
one regulates the whole quantity of the iteration
of events such as san-kai(three times) or &apos;n,an-
donto(many times) etc., and the other describes the
habitual repetition of events such as itumo(always)
or syottyuu(very often) etc. Both describe many
events each of which involves one person&apos;s act.
Finally, we shall mention Time in the past ad-
verbs. There are cases where the form -teiru, which
marks the present tense, can co-occur with tempo-
ral adverbs describing the past. (See the example
(1c) in the introduction.) It describes the experien-
tial fact of an event. Such adverbs as katute(once),
mukasi(in the past) and izen(before) determine the
temporal structure of the event related with tense.

2.4 Aspectual Forms
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999908321428571">
The ability of aspectual forms to follow verbs is con-
strained by the inherent features of verbs. We briefly
describe some of aspectual forms used in the exper-
iment.
The forms -you-to-suru(be going to) and -
kakeru(be about to) take up the occurrence of events.
They can follow the verbs which are dynamic(+d).
The form -tuzukeru(continue) can follow the verbs
which have duration(—a). It can take up either the
ongoing process or the resultant state. The form -
hajimeru(begin) can follow the verbs which have pro-
cess(+p) and takes up the start time of the process.
On the other hand, the forms -owaru(cease) and -
oeru(finish) can follow the verbs which are telic(+t)
and takes up the end point of the process. However,
these constraints on the inherent features of verbs
are only concerned with a single event. By itera-
tion, the whole process of a collective event can be
taken up regardless of the inherent features of verbs,
as mentioned above.
The forms -tutuaru(be in progress), -tekuru(come
into state) and -teiku(go into state) focus on the
gradual process of change. -Tutuaru(be in progress)
takes up it as a kind of state, -tekuru(come into
state) views it from the end state of change while
-teiku(go into state) from the initial state of change.
Both of -tekuru and -teiku have usages other than
aspect, as in mot-tekuru(bring) or mot-teiku(take).

3 Experiment
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.977627538461538">
We carried out an experiment to classify Japanese
verbs into six categories in the Table 1 by means of
corpus data.
As shown in the Figure 1, each category is defined
in terms of the ability to co-occur with aspectual
forms. However, the discrimination of the categories
needs negative evidence which we cannot use by def-
inition. A corpus only provides positive evidence.
Furthermore, some forms can be used regardless of
the features and have usages other than aspect as
discussed in the previous section. We must establish
a method which takes into these facts into account.

STEP:1 Pick out the items of which the governing and
dependent words are a verb and an adverb from
the EDR Co-occurrence Dictionary and store them
with the frequency in an array called PAIRS (cf.
Table 2).
STEP:2 For each adverb in PAIRS, give an adverb class
label (the initial letter of the class name) on the ba-
sis of the discussion in sec. 2.3 and store them in an
array called ADVERBS (cf. Table 3 and Table4).
STEP:3 For each verb in PAIRS, add up the frequency
of the co-occurrence with the adverbs contained in
the array ADVERBS. If the sum is greater than 4,
store the verb in a list called VERBS.
STEP:4 For each sentence in the corpus, find a verb
and if it is contained in VERBS, then:
STEP:4-1 If the form following the verb is con-
tained in the predefined list (Table 5), make
an array FORMS[i, j] positive (where i is the
position of the verb in the list VERBS and j
is the position of the form in the Table 5, see
Table 6), provided that the verb is not modi-
fied by repetition adverbs(R). When the form
is -tekuru or -teiku, put it on record only if
the verb is modified by gradual change indica-
tors(G).
STEP:4-2 If the verb is modified by the adverbs
contained in the array ADVERBS, refer to
the adverb class label and add 1 to an array
MODIFIED[i, kj (where i is the position of the
verb in the list VERBS and k is the position of
the adverb class label in the Table 4. When the
adverb is continuous one(C), distinguish the
cases where the verb is followed by -teiru(C1)
from the other cases(C2), see Table7), pro-
vided that the verb is not followed by negative
forms such as -nai or -zu, nor the forms which
change the voice such as -reru(the passivizer)
or -seru(the causativizer), since they affect the
aspectual properties of the attached verb.
STEP:5 For each verb in VERBS:
STEP:5-1 Narrow down the candidates by means
of the array FORMS (on the basis of possible
categories shown in Table 5).
STEP:5-2 In the case where the category of the
verb cannot be uniquely identified in STEP:5-
1, i.e., other than the category 6, determine it
by means of the array MODIFIED as follows:
ture. That is. the constituents have a governing-
dependent relation. It is these constituents that
form the head phrases of the Japanese Co-occurrence
Dictionary which describes collocational information
in the form of binary relations. Each item in the
Japanese Co-occurrence Dictionary consists of a gov-
erning word, a dependent word, the relator between
the words, and supplementary co-occurrence item
information which is composed of the frequency of
the co-occurrence relation and a portion of the ac-
tual example sentence from which the co-occurrence
relation was taken.
The algorithm used for classifying verbs is shown
in Figure 2.

The steps 1, 2 and 3 are the processes to deter-
mine the target verbs. There are 431 verbs modified
by the classified adverbs more than 4 times. In step
2, we classify adverbs on the basis of the discussion
in the previous section. Although the classification
has been done by hand, it is much easier than that
of verbs, since adverbs are fewer than verbs in num-
ber (2,563 vs. 12,766 in the corpus) and have higher
&amp;quot;iconicity&amp;quot; — the isomorphism between form and
meaning — than verbs. This classification of ad-
verbs is used not only for determining the aspectual
categories of verbs but also for examining the mean-
ing of -teiru as mentioned later.
The step 4 is a process to register the co-occurring
forms and adverbs for each verb. By using these
data, we identify the aspectual categories of verbs in
the step 5. Since the categories cannot be uniquely
identified by aspectual forms only, we use adverbs
which can modify the only restricted set of verbs as
shown in Table 8.

3.2 Evaluation and Discussion
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999912173913043">
Out of 431 target verbs, we could uniquely identify
categories for 375 verbs. As for the rest 56 verbs, 37
verbs were identified in the step 5-2 as the category
which was not included in the set of categories out-
putted by the step 5-1. This seems to be due to the
failure to detect the expression of repetition, there-
fore, we chose the category determined in the step
5-2. Table 9 shows the results.
We confirmed that more than 80% of verbs are
correctly classified. However, this is a subjective
judgement. To evaluate the results of the classifi-
cation more objectively, we focus on one evaluation
metric; namely the automatic examination of the
meaning of -teiru which can represent several dis-
tinct senses as described in the introduction.
The form -teiru indicates &amp;quot;zoom in&amp;quot; operation: it
is a function that takes an event as its input and
returns a type of states, which refers to unbounded
regions i.e., a part of the time-line with no distinct
boundaries. Figure 3 shows the time-line representa-
tion for each aspectual category of verbs. Aspectual
distinctions correspond to how parts of the time-line
are delineated.

Since -teiru cannot include a time instant at which
a state is drastically changed, it must denote one of
the intervals depicted below the lines. The interval
(1) in Figure 3 designates a state which is a part
of the state described by a lexical stative verb. It
means a state holding before a speaker&apos;s eyes.
It has been stated from (Kindaichi, 1976) that the
form -teiru has three distinct senses: &apos;a simple state&apos;,
&apos;a progressive state&apos; and &apos;a consequent state&apos;. (1)
corresponds to a simple state, (4) and (7) to a con-
sequent state, (6), (9) and (11) to a progressive state.
respectively. Though not represented in Figure 3, a
consequent state can be taken up with the verbs of
categories 5 and 6 if the endpoints of the processes
are set up by explicit expressions.
Kudo (Kudo, 1982) has pointed out that there are
inherent meaning and derivative meaning for both
progressive and consequent states and has sorted out
them as follows.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.997302555555556">
(i) inherent meaning of &apos;a progressive state&apos;: an
ongoing process
(ii) derivative meaning of &apos;a progressive state&apos;: an
iteration
(iii) inherent meaning of &apos;a consequent state&apos;: a re-
sultative state
(iv) derivative meaning of &apos;a consequent state&apos;: an
experiential state
(v) otherwise: a simple state
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99786824137931">
(ii) is the above-mentioned process of a collective
event; &amp;quot;a line as a set of points&amp;quot;, so to speak. (iv)
is a state where a speaker has an experience of the
event described by a verb and corresponds to the
intervals (2), (3), (5), (8), (10), (12) in Figure 3.
These derivative meanings are conditioned syntacti-
cally or contextually, that is, they are stipulated as
derivative by explicit linguistic expressions such as
adverbials etc., while not concerned with the inher-
ent features of verbs — they can appear with most
of verbs regardless of their aspectual categories.
We carried out an experiment to examine the
meaning of -teiru automatically by means of the clas-
sifications of verbs and adverbs obtained in the pre-
vious experiment. Table 10 shows the determination
process of the meaning of -teiru. We checked the
cases in Table 10 downward from the top.
Table 11 shows the results obtained from running
the process of Table 10 on 200 sentences containing
-teiru which are randomly selected from the EDR
Japanese Corpus.
The precision on the whole is 71%. Note that
the sense (i) &apos;an ongoing process&apos; has high recall but
low precision, while (iii) &apos;a resultative state&apos; and (iv)
&apos;an experiential state&apos; show the opposite. This is
due to the fact that the test sentences contain many
&amp;quot;speech-act&amp;quot; verbs such as syuchousuru(insist), se-
tumeisuru(explain), hyoumeisuru(declare) etc. They
are classified as 5.non-gradual process verbs, and by

the case 8 in Table 10, the senses of -teiru follow-
ing them are determined as (i) &apos;an ongoing process&apos;.
However, they takes a quotative to-case that marks
the content of the statement and this measures out
the event described by verbs. Therefore the resulta-
tive or experiential readings are preferred.
The other errors are caused by polysemous
verbs such as kakaru (hang/lie/fall...) or ataru
(hit/strike/be exposed/shine...). Their aspectual
properties are changed by the complements they
take. The analysis of how complements influence
the aspectual properties of their governing verbs is
beyond the scope of this paper. It seems to be a mat-
ter of pragmatic world knowledge rather than sense-
semantics (but see (Verkuyl, 1993) for English).

We think that the extraction of aspectual infor-
mation must be based on principles that are well-
grounded in linguistic theory. However, some sort
of noise reduction technique such as the confidence
intervals used by Brent may be needed to detect the
cue more accurately.

5 Conclusion

<bodyText confidence="0.999915523809524">
In this paper, we have proposed a method for classi-
fying Japanese verbs on the basis of surface evidence
from a monolingual corpus, and examined the mean-
ing of the form -teiru by means of the classifications
of verbs and adverbs.
The aspect of verb phrases provides not only the
temporal configuration within a single event but also
the information needed for processing temporal re-
lation between multiple events (Dowty, 1986; Pas-
sonneau, 1988; Webber, 1988).
Furthermore, the lexical aspect of verbs is closely
related with their deep complement structures which
may not be directly reflected on the surface argu-
ment structures. Therefore, by combining the aspec-
tual categories of verbs and those that are defined in
terms of their surface argument structures, we can
obtain an elaborate classification based on seman-
tic types of verbs. (Preliminary experiments on this
issue can be seen in (Oishi and Matsumoto, 1996).)
Thus, the information obtained here can be used
for various applications.

This paper describes an approach to extract the aspectual information of Japanese verb phrases from a monolingual corpus. In the next section, we will classify Japanese verbs into six categories by means of aspectual features following the framework of (Bennett et al., 1990). The aspectual forms land adverbs are defined as the functions which operate on verbs&apos; aspectual features and changes their values. By using the constraints of the applicability of the functions, we can identify a unique category for each verb automatically. If one can acquire aspectual properties of verbs properly and know how the other constituents in a sentence operate on them, then the aspectual meaning of the whole sentence will be determined monotonically.

We adopt and extend the feature-based framework proposed by (Bennett et al., 1990) in the spirit of (Moens and Steedman, 1988). They uses three features: ±dynamic, ±telic, and ±atomic. We add two more features: ±process and ±gradual. The feature dynamicity distinguishes between states(—d) and events(+d), and atomicity distinguishes between point events(+a) and extended events(—a). The duration described by verbs is twofold: an ongoing process and a consequent state. The feature process concerns an ongoing process and distinguishes whether events described by verbs have the duration for which some actions unfold. The feature telicity distinguishes between culminative events(</context>
