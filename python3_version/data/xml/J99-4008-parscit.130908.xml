WordNet, the on-line English thesaurus and lexical database developed at Princeton
University by George Miller and his colleagues (Fellbaum 1998), has proved to be
an extremely important resource used in much research in computational linguis-
tics where lexical knowledge of English is required. The goal of the EuroWordNet
project is to create similar wordnets for other languages of Europe. The initial four
languages are Dutch (at the University of Amsterdam), Italian (CNR, Pisa), Spanish
(Fundacion Universidad Empresa), and English (University of Sheffield, adapting the
original WordNet); later Czech, Estonian, German, and French will be added. The
results of the project will be publicly available.&apos;
Like the original Princeton WordNet, the new wordnets—that&apos;s now a generic
term—are hierarchies in which each node is a synset: a word sense, with which one
or more synonymous words or phrases is associated. The synsets are connected by
relations such as hyponymy, meronymy, and antonymy. However, some improvements
have been made to the original design of WordNet. New relationships, including
relationships across parts of speech, have been introduced. For example, the verb
adorn and the noun adornment are related by XPOS_NEAR_SYNONYMY; hyponymy and
hyperonymy2 across parts of speech are also permitted. Semantic roles of verbs are
marked; for example, the noun student is related to the verb teach by ROLETATIENT; the
inverse relationship is called INVOLVED_PATIENT. Another new relationship, both within
and across parts of speech, is causality, which may further be marked as intentional or
nonfactive; for example, to redden CAUSES red; to search CAUSES (nonfactive, intentional) to
find. Meronyrny is much more fine-grained than in Princeton WordNet, with a number
of new kinds of part-whole relationships.
The most important new development, however, is multilinguality: the use of a
common framework to build the individual wordnets and integrate them in a single
database in which an inter-lingual-index (ILI) connects the synsets that are &amp;quot;equiv-
alent&amp;quot; in the different languages. EuroWordNet thus becomes a multilingual lexicon
and thesaurus that could be used in applications such as multilingual text retrieval
and (rather basic) lexical transfer in machine translation. The project has sought to

preference to Princeton&apos;s hypernymy of nouns and troponymy of verbs.

carefully respect the differing conceptualizations and lexicalizations of each individ-
ual language while creating a language-independent framework for the multilingual
database.
A key element of multilinguality was ensuring that the conceptual core of each of
the wordnets would be similar in its coverage. A set of 1,024 base concepts common
to all the languages (though not necessarily lexicalized in all of them) was developed
iteratively, starting with an algorithmic identification of potential base concepts in each
language, merging the results by selecting those proposed by at least two of the four
languages, and carefully tuning the results. The base concepts include increase, steal,
health, and cause pain. A language-independent top ontology was then built from 63
very abstract top concepts; these are used as semantic features to classify the base
concepts.3
The inter-lingual-index serves to link &amp;quot;equivalent&amp;quot; synsets in the various word-
nets. The synsets of Princeton (English) WordNet were used as the initial set of index
records, as this wordnet is a particularly fine-grained one. New records can be added
where necessary. Cross-linguistic equivalence is generally taken as synonymy, denoted
EQ_SYNONYMY; but where a synset in one language has no unique direct equivalent in
the ILI, it may be linked to several ILI records simultaneously as an EQ_NEAR_SYNONYM,
or linked to a record by EQ_HAS_HYPERONYM or EQ_HAS_HYPONYM if it is more specific
or less specific, respectively, than any ILI record.
The book EuroWordNet is a collection of six papers on the EuroWordNet project
by editor Vossen and his colleagues.&apos; Five of the papers describe the structure of the
EuroWordNet database and the methods employed to construct it, and the sixth specu-
lates on the possible benefits of using EuroWordNet in cross-language text retrieval. In
addition, presumably for completeness, a short seventh paper by Christiane Fellbaum
outlines the original Princeton English WordNet.
The papers were all written in late 1997 (or perhaps earlier) while the project was
still under way and the wordnets were not complete. So while all the methodological
and design decisions had been made, and could be usefully reported to the research
community, the EuroWordNet database itself was far from complete and little in the
way of evaluation or application could have been carried out. Consequently, the pa-
per on applying EuroWordNet in text retrieval is largely speculative and sometimes
written in the future tense—indeed, it describes itself as a &amp;quot;proposal&amp;quot;—and might bet-
ter have been reserved for publication at a time when the project had actually been
performed. The paper on the ILI also often lapses into the future tense.
The volume was previously published as a special issue of the journal Computers
and the Humanities, and is paginated both as a book and as a journal fascicle (which
means that page references in the overlap of the two ranges are ambiguous). It differs
from most such special issues in being tightly focused on a single project, with frequent
cross-references between the papers. In fact, one might rather think of it as a book that
was prepublished as a journal—certainly, many readers will approach it as a unitary

3 While one understands the spatial metaphors inherent in the individual elements of the EuroWordNet
terminology, they are confusing when combined, and one ends up wondering just how a wordnet is
supposed to be oriented. In particular, if top concepts are indeed metaphorically at the top, then base
concepts must be metaphorically in the middle, with all other concepts hanging below them; but on
the other hand, if base concepts are metaphorically at the base, then other concepts must be
metaphorically on top of them except for the top concepts, which are somehow underneath them.
4 Except for Vossen&apos;s introduction, all of the papers have many authors and many of the authors are
involved in several of the papers. The complete set of authors is: Geert Adriaens, Antonietta Alonge,
Francesca Bertagna, Laura Bloksma, Nicoletta Calzolari, Irene Castellon, Salvador Climent, Pedro
Diez-Orzas, Julio Gonzalo, Elisabetta Marinai, Antonia Marti, Carol Peters, Wim Peters, German Rigau,
Horacio Rodriguez, Adriana Roventini, Felisa Verdejo, and Piek Vossen.

work, to be read from start to finish—and it is its value in this regard that merits
this review. However, this point also serves to make the absence of an index, which
should be found even in journal-issue reprints, that much less forgivable. And tables of
reference material, such as a glossary of terms and a complete list of the EuroWordNet
lexical relationships, are given as appendices to individual papers, not at the back of
the book, so the reader has to either remember which paper has which reference
material or perform a search.
The quality of the writing and editing are reasonable, the notation is mostly con-
sistent, and the book is largely free of typos. A couple of exceptions: On page 25, the
word finger should be Barbary ape; on page 89, the underlining promised in example 8
is missing. While the papers are fairly well cross-referenced, they remain independent
papers rather than interdependent chapters of a book; the need for each to stand alone
as a journal paper leads to some annoying redundancy for the reader who approaches
the work as a linear unit. The final paper, for example, begins by defining EuroWord-
Net as if the reader had never heard of it before. The papers also vary widely in the
emphasis that they give to the methodology and process of designing and building the
database relative to the emphasis given to the actual resulting design and content. The
former is interesting and needs to be documented, but the latter is what most readers
will want to concentrate on; yet the reader who turns to the section on base concepts
(p. 52ff) will find a long description of the method by which the set of base concepts
was derived but very few examples of actual base concepts (fortunately, they can be
found in the section on the top ontology (p. 64ff)). And it is unclear why the papers
are in the order that they are; for example, the paper on the inter-lingual-index, which
seems to belong in about the middle of the book, appears only at the end, after the
paper on applying EuroWordNet to cross-language text retrieval, which presupposes
knowledge of the inter-lingual-index.
It is unfortunate, therefore, that this book is likely to become the definitive refer-
ence on EuroWordNet. It has preempted the publication of a better-organized, fully
integrated, properly indexed book. Nonetheless, there is much of interest in EuroWord-
Net for the computational lexical semanticist, and much in EuroWordNet that will be of
immediate practical use for anyone requiring lexical resources in any of the languages
covered.
