This volume is one of the most valuable publications in psycholinguistics of the last
decade. It is a collection of 22 chapters, all written by leading contemporary investi-
gators, presenting much of the best recent empirically-based research and speculation
on spoken language comprehension by humans (mainly adults). The chapters divide
into three general areas, all of primary current concern: word identification (occupying
about two-thirds of the book), syntactic parsing, and the relation between intonational
structure and syntactic structure. Literally every chapter develops interesting ideas in
a clear and rigorous fashion.
The volume is particularly useful because, unlike most collections, the chapters
engage one another substantively. Three chapters act as explicit commentaries on oth-
ers, and elaborate independent points as well. Many of the other chapters also contain
specific responses to the claims and approaches described in related chapters. Further,
the editor&apos;s introduction comprehensively delineates the areas of agreement, disagree-
ment, and complementarity among the chapters. As a whole, the book provides a
coherent picture of the rich theoretical and methodological scene that comprises psy-
cholinguistics today.
In the following, I summarize the background and major themes of each group of
chapters.

1. Word Identification
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996729083333333">
Current theoretical and methodological approaches to auditory word identification
are strongly inspired by the work of Marslen-Wilson (1987) and his colleagues. This
work indicates that upon reception of the initial sounds of a word, all of the words in
the perceiver&apos;s lexicon that share those initial sounds are activated in parallel. These
words might vary in their degree of activation, depending upon how closely they fit the
auditory stimulus. As further sounds are received, the activation levels are adjusted,
until a point is reached (perhaps before the end of the word stimulus) at which a
decision procedure determines that one word has significantly greater activation than
any others and adopts it as the lexical percept. In addition, syntactic and semantic
context can influence activation levels or the decision procedure.
Arising from this general conception are a number of specific issues addressed by
the contributors (Richard Shillcock; Uli Frauenfelder and Guus Peeters; Dennis Norris;

1. What algorithm underlies the decision procedure for adoption of a
particular word?
2. It is already known that the frequencies of occurrence of the word
candidates influence the speed of word identification. What is the locus
of this influence: initial activation levels or the decision procedure?
3. What influence, if any, does the size of the set of activated word
candidates have upon identification processes?
4. Do strongly activated word candidates inhibit the activation levels of
other candidates?
5. What is the role of the syllable, particularly the stressed syllable?
6. How are word boundaries in the continuous speech stream located?
7. What is the nature and degree of contextual influences on word
identification? (This is the issue of modularity&apos;, various characterizations
of which are considered by the authors.)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999464">
The chapters provide contrasting responses to each of these issues, with many
chapters addressing more than one issue. Data are reported from psycholinguistic
experiments on humans, cognitive simulations (which are really another form of psy-
cholinguistic experimentation), and statistical analyses of dictionaries. Much of the
research aims to develop precise connectionist models, with the major influences
being McClelland and Elman&apos;s (1986) TRACE model and Jordan&apos;s (1986) recurrent-
link dynamic networks. Furthermore, Elman&apos;s chapter, which is framed as a reply to
Fodor and Pylyshyn (1988), demonstrates just how radical an alternative to traditional
symbol-based processing connectionism can be (cf. related work by Elman (1990) and
van Gelder (1990)).

2. Syntactic Parsing
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999614769230769">
Some theorists (e.g., Clifton and Frazier 1989) have claimed that only general structural
principles and strategies are used by initial parsing processes, with application of
lexical information delayed until a later stage of parsing. The chapter by Michael
Tanenhaus, Susan Garnsey, and Julie Boland presents experimental evidence (including
neurophysiological results) against this claim. Their work indicates that locating wh-
gaps is immediately guided by the parser attempting to assign the thematic roles
specified by the verb (see also Tanenhaus and Carlson 1989; Kurtzman, Crawford,
and Nychis-Florence 1991). Their experiments also indicate that control relations (as
in Jane forced/promised Mary to go to the store) are immediately computed on the basis of
the verb.
Lyn Frazier&apos;s chapter develops a view of the parser as modularly organized. She
argues for separate modules for: building constituent structure, assigning binding re-
lations (e.g., in wh-constructions), assigning thematic roles, and assigning syntactic

constituents to discourse elements (cf. Weinberg 1987). Frazier claims that the first
two of these are completely &amp;quot;informationally encapsulated,&amp;quot; which is one of Jerry
Fodor&apos;s (1983) criteria for a module. The other two, however, are only &amp;quot;pseudoencap-
sulated,&amp;quot; since they make constrained use of nonlinguistic information (but otherwise
obey Fodor&apos;s criteria). They serve as intermediaries between linguistic and general
knowledge (similar to the claims of Tanenhaus and Carlson 1989).
The commentary chapter by Janet Dean Fodor analyzes and extends the proposals
of Tanenhaus et al. and Frazier in terms of the broad issues that organize recent parsing
research, including single versus parallel analysis and the role of semantic influences.
The claims put forward in these chapters are not specific to spoken language pro-
cessing. Researchers today assume that most parsing processes operate on both spoken
and written input, and in fact parsing experiments typically use only written stimuli
(because controlled presentation is easier to maintain). However, spoken language
does uniquely give rise to questions concerning the role of intonational information
in parsing.

3. Intonation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999827833333333">
In recent years the dominant linguistic approach to explaining intonation phenom-
ena has been that represented by Selkirk (1984), who posits distinct levels of into-
national structure, syntactic structure, and information structure (concerned with fo-
cus/presupposition). (See also Inkelas and Zec 1990.) Mark Steedman&apos;s chapter argues
that the alternative approach of combinatory categorial grammar (Steedman 1989) al-
lows these three levels to be collapsed into one. This then opens up the possibility of a
sentence comprehension system that uses syntactic, intonational, and semantic infor-
mation simultaneously and efficiently in the word-by-word processing of the incoming
sentence (see also Altmann and Steedman 1988). Aravind Joshi&apos;s commentary chap-
ter argues that tree-adjoining grammars can be developed that are weakly equivalent
to combinatory categorial grammars and that also maintain a close relation between
syntactic and intonational structure (although not the identity relation as proposed by
Steedman).
Finally, the chapter by Mitchell Marcus and Donald Hindle offers a parser-based
account of obligatory intonation boundaries (those boundaries whose absence would
render the string ungrammatical or would require that a different syntactic structure
be assigned to it). Marcus and Hindle assume, following work such as that of Tanen-
haus and his colleagues, that the syntactic parser actively assigns a verb-specified
thematic role to each constituent as it is identified. However, they further assume that
an intonation boundary terminates thematic assignment for a particular verb. Marcus
and Hindle argue, within the deterministic parsing framework of description theory
(Marcus 1987), that obligatory boundaries occur at all and only the points that are
necessary to prevent misassignment of thematic roles. (See related experimental work
by Carroll and Slowiaczek 1987.)

4. Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998482">
This volume provides complete state-of-the-art coverage (as of 1990) of research in
auditory word identification, including specific methodologies and data. Its coverage
of parsing and intonation research is not as broad or detailed, but the chapters do
touch upon all the chief issues and present important ideas that will be influential in
future work.

Although the volume is primarily a contribution to the professional psycholin-
guistics literature, most of it is accessible to any motivated reader who is generally
acquainted with the issues underlying recent investigation of speech and language pro-
cessing. Many of the chapters are admirable for their careful organization of complex
material. The editor&apos;s introduction is an accurate and useful overview of the volume,
although it provides not so much an orientation or grounding as a high-level summary
that makes sense only after the chapters have been skimmed for their main points.
As this volume demonstrates, psycholinguistics has grown enormously in both
range and sophistication since the days of Fodor, Bever, and Garrett (1974). Not only
have new empirical methods been developed, but considerable consensus has been
attained on the conceptual frameworks within which specific theoretical claims are
formulated and tested. (Nonetheless, one broad conceptual issue touched upon in this
volume for which there is not yet consensus is whether connectionist representations
can adequately capture the linguistic knowledge that has traditionally been expressed
in the form of explicit symbolic rules.) Further, there has been a significant conver-
gence on particular classes of processing models. The outlook for a cognitive theory
of language has never been brighter.
