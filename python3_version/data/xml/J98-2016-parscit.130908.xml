This volume contains papers presented at the 2nd International Workshop
&amp;quot;Machine Translation and Translation Theory&amp;quot; held at the University of
Hildesheim in 1994, as well as invited contributions. Experts from Europe
and the United States demonstrate how machine translation can profit from
insights gained in translation theory and vice versa.

<bodyText confidence="0.99922375">
This book is about investigating the way people
use language in speech and writing. It introduces
the corpus-based approach to the study of lan-
guage, based on analysis of large databases of real
language examples and illustrates exciting new
findings about language and the different ways that
people speak and write. The book is important
both for its step-by-step descriptions of research
methods and for its findings about grammar and
vocabulary, language use, language learning, and
differences in language use across texts and user
groups.

This book reviews current theories of the sound-
structure of words and syllables. Dr. Coleman
presents technical arguments showing that the
contemporary theories are too complex and that a
simpler theory, Declarative Phonology, is adequate.
This theory is exemplified with detailed accounts
of the sound-structure of words and syllables in
English and Japanese.

Presented in this book is a theory of concept
formation and understanding that does not make
use of a notion of an innate mental language
as a means of concept representation. Instead,
experimental concepts are treated semantically
as stabilizing structuring of growing sets of data,
which are sets of experienced satisfaction situa-
tions for expressions, and theoretical concepts
are based on coherent sets of general sentences
held true.

Australian Aboriginal languages have many inter-

some of the central assumptions of current lin-

properties of case morphology in these noncon-
figurational languages, including extensive case

Linguistics and Philosophy is a journal for studies focused
on natural language, and is of interest to practitioners in the
disciplines covered in the title. Although the field thus
described is so extensive that a complete listing of relevant
topics is precluded, at least the following specifically fall
within it:
- traditional areas in the philosophy of language such as
meaning, truth, reference, description, entailment, speech
acts
- traditional areas of linguistics such as syntax, semantics
and pragmatics (when the studies are of sufficient
explicitness and generality to be also of philosophical
interest)
- aspects of artificial intelligence concerned with language
such as computational linguistics and natural language
processing
- systems of logic with strong connections to natural
language: modal logic, tense logic, epistemic logic,
intensional logic
- philosophical questions raised by linguistics as a science:
linguistics methodology, the status of linguistics theories,
the nature of linguistic universals
- philosophically interesting problems at the intersection of
linguistics and other disciplines: language acquisition,
language and perception, language as a social
convention.

Guidelines for Submissions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.699683">
Manuscripts for Computational Linguistics should be submitted on letter-size paper (8.5 by
11 inches, or A4), double-spaced and single-sided throughout, including footnotes and refer-
ences. The paper should begin with an informative abstract of approximately 150-250 words.
Manuscripts must be written in English. Contact the editor regarding the possibility of electronic
submission.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.919188">
Submissions may be made in any of the following categories: ,
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.964337722222222">
Papers: This category includes contributions that report significant new research results in com-
putational linguistics or that provide critical reviews of the literature on a particular topic. The
length of a paper depends on its content, but it is suggested that manuscripts be limited to
forty double-spaced, pages. That is the equivalent of thirty journal pages. Each paper is fully
refereed by three or four experts in the field. Manuscripts may also be submitted electronically;
consult http:/ /www.cs.columbia.edu/—radev/acl/subrnit.txt for instructions and pointers to
the LATEX style files. The submission of ah article to CL for refereeing means that the author
certifies the manuscript is not Copyrighted; nor has it been published or submitted for publica-
tion to another refereed journal. If any version of the paper has appeared, or will appear, in a
non-refereed publication, the details of such publication must be made known to the Editor at
the time of submission. The final version of a paper tentatively accepted for publication must
be accompanied by a Copyright Transfer Agreement signed by all of the authors or, in the
case of a &amp;quot;work for hire,&amp;quot; by the employer. This written transfer is necessary under the 1978
U.S. Copyright law.
Letters to the Editor: This category includes statements of opinion on- issues relevant to the
readership. The Editor and the editorial board will evaluate the appropriateness of these con-
tributions for inclusion.
Five copies of papers or three copies of letters should be sent to:

Squibs and Discussions: This category includes short articles reporting technical results, dis-

Founded in 1962, the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) is the primary scientific and
professional society for natural language processing research and applications. A European chapter was
established in 1982. Besides publishing Computational Linguistics, the ACL holds international meetings
(annually in North America, biennially in Europe) where the state-of-the-art in natural language
processing research and development is presented. Recently, special interest groups on the Mathematics of
Language, the Lexicon, Parsing, Generation, Computational Phonology, Multimedia Language Processing,
and Very Large Corpora have been formed; others are likely to be added.

<abstract confidence="0.969685916666667">This book is about investigating the way people use language in speech and writing. It introduces the corpus-based approach to the study of language, based on analysis of large databases of real language examples and illustrates exciting new findings about language and the different ways that people speak and write. The book is important both for its step-by-step descriptions of research methods and for its findings about grammar and vocabulary, language use, language learning, and in language texts and user groups.</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.9876693">Presented in this book is a theory of concept formation and understanding that does not make a notion of an innate mental language as a means of concept representation. Instead, experimental concepts are treated semantically as stabilizing structuring of growing sets of data, which are sets of experienced satisfaction situations for expressions, and theoretical concepts are based on coherent sets of general sentences held true.</abstract>
