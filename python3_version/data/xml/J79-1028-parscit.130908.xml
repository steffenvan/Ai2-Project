THE LOGICAL FOUNDATIONS OF MEASUREMENT OF SEMANTIC INFORMATION
NIKOLAJ STANULOV
</note>
<bodyText confidence="0.88003925">
A method is described for determining the relative quantity
of semantic informatiOn (QSI) in a written natural-language text
(the QSI method). The construction of the method is based on
the ideas of logical semantics, mathematical logic, and the so-
:ailed thesaurus approach. The logical bases are given with the
help of axioms of semantic information and their corollaries
Information, and hence semantic information, is described in set-
theoretic fashion. The natural language enters the to.Le of
object language; proceeding from it a formal language is constructed
whcih is conditionally termed an algebraic information (Al)
language; this is the fragmentary metalanguage defined by the
correspondence of the object langt,lage. The translation of texts
from this language into the Al language (i.e. the compilation of
AI expre-sions) allows the determination of the quantity of in-
formation in object-language texts. The quantity of semantic
information is expressed by the element number of semantic space
uf the type of algebraic field of real (and possibly of other)
numbers. The WI method ill.L.Ludes as a frequent case the solving
of verbal problems in mathematics (not excluding the measurement
among the numbers of the QST) Several means for the analysis of
texts are discussed, as are the rules for compiling Al expressions
The proposed method is suitable for application to any
texts, particularly in informatics--in information processing
(indexing and the like) of bibliographic materials.

ON DISCRETE (NON-SHANNON) CALCULATION OF ENTROPY
IVAN DOBREV
R. V L. Hartley (1928) introduced the following mathema-
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.99768785">
tical expression of entropy H. Ili= log n, where n is the number
of equiprobable experimental outcomes This formula can be
understood only as a postulate and by no means as a formal,
logical conclusion from more elementary proposals, since there
is an error in Hartley&apos;s chain of deductions. From the mathema-
tical point of view, the conclusion of.C. Shannon (1942) that
H = log n is fully rigorous, but it is the consequence of very
strong preliminary assumptions (axioms) on entropy as a function
of the number of equiprobable outcomes n According to Shannon,
the function H = f(n) must be a continuous, additive and monoton
function. How-ver continuity and additivity are not necessary
conditions. The identification of one of the n equiprobable out-
comes of the experiment by the method of binary questions is a
discrete process. A simple experiment with n = kl equiprobable
outcomes and a sequence of two simple experiments with k and 1
equiprobable outcomes are two different things.
Assuming that entr6py is the measure of the average quantity
of binary questions necessary for the identification of one of
the equiprobable ouLcome of the experiment we set (1)(1) = 0 and
the recurrence relation (1)(n) = 1 + (0(n/2) for all even values and

ON THE QUANTITATIVE FOUNDATION OF LINGUISTIC CLASSIFICATIONS
MIROSLAV YANAKIEV
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999871684210526">
In the process of working out a frequency dictionary of con-
temporary Bulgarian, it has become clear that the classification
procedures, while at least having a place in Bulgarian linguistic
investigations, are implicitly founded on the information, intui-
tively accumulated in the knowledge of linguists, on the statis-
tical characteristics of distribution of the language facts
studied in texts. Unfortunately the linguist does not by any
means always succeed in studying texts in such quantity that the
automatisms accumulated in his knowledge of statistical informa-
tion on the phenomena being studied might create a sufficiently
reliable fulcrum for the execution of classification procedures,
which are &amp;quot;thin ler&amp;quot; than those already long known in linguistic
tradition.
In this we can see the profound reason for the cul-de-sac
into which contemporary linguistics has wandered. Inasmucti as the
application of computers for the ektraction of information on the
statistical characteristics of the distribution of language facts
makes work possible with enormous files of text, computer
linguistics is the exit from this impasse.

SOME PROBABILITY PARAMETERS OF A STRUCTURAL-SEMANTIC DESCRIPTION
OF THE BULGARIAN LEXICAL SYSTEM
D. A. RAJNOVA
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.997380727272727">
The problem of creating such a grouping of the dictionary
content of a language in which the separate word would neighbor
those words with which it relates semantically and functionally,
and in direct() proximity with the word from which it is formed,
has long awaited solution.
Practically, this means the consideration of the word as
boundary set of subsystems. We have carried out such an exami-
nation with the help of punched cards with edge-notching and
machine information processing. We have termed the working
method structural semantics. In the process of this develop-
ment, the necessity has arisen for new terms. The term &amp;quot;con-
ceptual bundle&amp;quot;, which we have accepted conditionally, embraces
words with one and the same internal linguistic motivation lifte
characteristics of the bundle are defined as the external valency
of a certain nuclear pireme and as the sum of the frequencies of
the separate lexical units entering into its composition, deter-
mined on the basis of their greatest separate weight of their
functioning in syntactic constructions.
The method we have worked out for the structural-semantic
description of real lexical systems has permitted the determina-
tion of a number of probability parameters for the Bulgarian
lexical system.

The object of research is the class of communications verbs
(Vc). The class Vc is delimited with the help of four filters.
I. a Vc is copied from dictionaries or other linguistic hand-
books; II. a Vc is isolated from a text in a logical-intuitive
manner; III. the Vcs isolated by filters I and II are verified
in a combination matrix; IV. the presence of the semantic factor
&amp;quot;input f communication&amp;quot; is sought out, with the help of compo-
nential analysis; for each verb having passed through filters I,
II, and III.
The investigation of the class Vc is carried out on a selec-
tion from journalistic texts (on one theme or another), 10,000
word-forms in volume. The quantitative distribution of Vcs in
the given selection is observed, taking into account X, B, V.
On the basis of these data, conclusions are drawn (with a cer-
tain degree of reliability) on the appearance of Vcs in texts
which are homogeneous in style and theme.
The lexical and grammatical combinability of Vcs with the
communications agent (N) is studied. The communications agents
are unified by the semantic factor of &amp;quot;inputs of communication&amp;quot;
Mose cases are followed up in which the distributive relations
(lexical, grammatical) for various vcs coincide, and account is
taken of the influence of the distribution on the semantic proxi-
mity of the verbs of the class Vc. The intensity of combination
between N and Vc is determined.
The &amp;quot;Input mode of communication&amp;quot; (S) is exaTined. Basic
constructions are distinguished with the help of the Vcs. The
characteristic construction(s) for each verb of the class Vc is
determined. For verbs of communication input semantic nearness
is found by the same method. The value of the Vc-S correlation
coefficient is given.

The dictionary is compiled on the basis of a textual file
of 500,000 grammatical forms. It embraces all joirrnnigstic
genres and is compiled by methods accepted abroa(..
Each separate lexeme is represented with the following sta-

absolute frequencies and their statistical indices.
The dictionary will contain the following divisions an
alphabetic list of lexemes and their allolexemes, a ranked list
of lexemes with their absolute frequencies, a diagram of the
frequencies of all grammatical categories encountered in the

ON THE &amp;quot;STRENGTH&amp;quot; OF THE INTERMORPHEMIC BOND

M. YANAKIEV, K. NAJDENOV, M. KOTAROV AND N. V. KOTOVA
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999870625">
It is accepted as a working hypothesis that the linguist
appraise the &amp;quot;strength&amp;quot; of the intermorphemic bond (the &amp;quot;strength&amp;quot;
of a junction of morphemes) as a certain function of two condi-
tional probabilities--the probability of the presence of the first
morpheme before the second (it being known that the second al-
ready exists) and the probability of the presence of the second
morpheme after the first (it being known that the first already
exists)
The explanatory power of the accepted hypothesis is clari-
fied. It turned out that the behavior of linguists in the process
of morphemic segmentation. of a communication is much easier to
explain if one proceeds from the hypothesis being verified than
if one proceeds from the previously tacitly accepted hypothesis
on the evaluation of the &amp;quot;strength&amp;quot; of the intermorphemic bond
for the appearance in the&apos; report of a second morpheme after the
presence of the first in the report became known.

The subject of discussion is the work which serves as the
basis for tht graduating thesis prepared in the Laboratory of
Mathematical Linguistics of the OKTU sedeur of the Institute of
Mathematics and Mechanics of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences
under the direction of Doctor of Philological Sciences A
Ljudskanov. Its goal is the realization of automatic segmenta-
tion according to the &apos;morphological principle of prefixes and
&amp;quot;prefix like&amp;quot; elements at the beginning of the word form and the
establishment of the leftmost limit of the root of the word falai
&amp;quot;Prefix like&amp;quot; elements are the series of graphemes which may form
the initial portion of complex words.
This work forms part of a system for automatic segmentatIou
of Bulgarian word forms into morphemes.
In the work presented one can differentiate information and
logic portions The information portion consists of a list of
prefixes and prefix-like elements and of lists of &amp;quot;exceptions&amp;quot;
for each prefix, the logic portion includes rules for working with
the above and indicates the succession of the computer&apos;s work.
In the pTesent work the information portion is limited to
the letter &amp;quot;z&amp;quot; of the Bulgarian alphabet, but this in no way
disturbs the universality of the proposed algorithm
The programming of the algorithm is being carried out in

A MODEL OF SOUND LINKAGE AND MODIFICATION IN BULGARIAN SUFFIXES
STEFAN KHRISTOV
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.991323368421053">
The linkages established by means of a mathematical model
of Bulgarian phonetics are fully explicated in the particular
structure of the language, in the given instance in suffixes.
The mathematical model reveals a lnaguage to be a system of
structures and mechanisms, the function oE which obeys the laws
of thought. Such regularities in the internal Logic are ob-
served in Bulgarian in mutually conditioned changes, within the
framework of each complex pair of alternating consonants and
vowels.
These regularities can serve as the criterion in creating a
model of human speech activity, which can be utilized in the
creation of a scientifically based theory, both for stenography
and for the creation of a machine for recording of speech.
The mathematical model of Bulgarian phonetics for the
complex pairs of alternating consonants and vowels can be
examined dialectically, i.e. in its unity and contradiction
In such a case it can be bifurcated into two consonants or
into two vowels with contrastive structures, which are located
between each other in a certain congeneric linkage.

The length of the original is 44,000 word-uses, of the transla-

The frequencies of the 3rd person, singular, neuter pronouns
and 2nd person plural pronouns are not reliable. The difference
in numbers is an indication that the function of indicating per-
son in the formation of verb-forms is weakened in Bulgarian
personal pronouns. If one addresses one&apos;s attention to the in-
stances of the pleonastic use of pronouns (nego go, nas ni, etc )
and also to the reprise of nouns (Az Mayakovski go uvazhavam, etc
then the divergence in frequencies appears even more significant
A chi-square test shows that the divergence between frequencies

A QUANTITATIVE MODEL OF RUSSIAN WORD FORRATION
(ACCORDING TO DATA FROM A RUSSIAN CLUSTER-FREQUENCY DICTiONARY)
L. N. ZASORINA
U. S. S. R.
The materials of the Russian Frequency Dictionary, created
by coworkers at the Leningrad and Got kovskoe State Universities,
have served as the basis for a Cluster-Frequency Dictionary
(compilers. L, M. Akul enko, E. S. Andreeva, L. N. Zasorina.
M. I. Privalova and E. V. Tisenko). It was initiated from a
glossary of 39,268 units received in a selection of 1,056,382
word uses compiled from four groups of texts--magazines and news-
papers, scientific publications, prose, and drama
The original glossary was subjected to a preliminary ordering
Nonnormative variants of words (of the type rodnyj, shkap, botin-
ka) were reducted to normative ones, and participles were reduced
to infinitive forms. As a result, the compressiQn of the gloss-
ary to 38,000 lexemes was achieved.
The distribution of the vocabulary into clusters was con-
ducted by way of unifying 81 derivatives having motivation on
the same root (an identical root,and a-general semantic compo-
nent). A word with a nonproductive base is accepted as the
index of the cluster, e.g. GOVOR (say), ZHIT&apos; (live), ZNAT&apos; (know)
A cluster is considered a group of words consisting of not less
than three words.
In the process of clustering, a class of nonclustering words
was isolated It embraced 3000 units, among which stands out a
small group of auxiliary words (prepositions, conjunctions, and
interjections) and a group of nouns and adjectives, both proper
and ethnonymically productive (Kievan, Londonite, Fraunhoferian,
etc.). Borrowing constitutes the major part of this class (akr,
acre; analoj, lectern; ar (as in hectare), etc ) and etymologically
isolated lexemes (borshch, proso, millet, rataj, peasant-plowman,
etc.).

The distribution by clusters of the basic file has proven
uneven. In all, 2500 different clusters have been isoiated (this
result merits attention in comparison with the familiar data
T. F. Efremova and A. I. Kuznetsova received 4500 roots, and D
Worth et al. 10,593 clusters). By our calculations, the 200
highest-frequency clusters embrace 627 of all diffttent words
At the same time the 105 highest-frequency clusters (e &gt; 1000)
includes 30% of the glossary and covers 27% of the entire selec-
tion. The second group of 100 clusters (95) forms 32% of the
words and covers 127 of all word uses. All remainiNt lexemes
(about 16,000) are distributed among the lesser-numbered
clusters.
For a quantitative model of word formation there exist two
root-word indices. The, word-formina_capacity of the root word
is determined by the quantity of products of a given root in the
dictionary--the ratio of the number of products to the number of
all different entries. By this r-tio the roots IMET&apos; (possess)
VODIT&apos; (lead): LEZHAT&apos; (lie), DAT&apos; (give), ROD (gen-), DELO
(matter, affair, busines6), ZHIT&apos; (live), BIT (be), and others
are found in the leading portion of the distribution.
The text-forming capacity is chAracterized by the mean fre-
quency of the derivatives in the cluster--the ratio of the total
frequency of the cluster to the number of its derivatives A
specific .property of pronoun roots is displayed, compare ETO
(ETOT, POETOMU), this (pronoun), this (demonstrative adjective)
for this reason, 13,334/3 = 4,444, MOJ (POMOEMU, 10100, my, in my
opinion, we, 7976/3 = 2,658, CHTO (wnat, which), 18636/35 = 407
etc. A comparatively large text-forming capacity is also found
among the numbers ONE and TWO and among nearby and semisignifi-
cant roots BIG, OTHER, OBLIGED/MWT. Among the significant
words located in the leading portion of the distribution by mean
frequencies are the roots SAY (84), WANT (71.7), SPEAK (49 6), and
NEW (49 5)

AN ALGORITHM TO DISCLOSE THE SET OF POTERTIAL ANTECEDENTS

MARIA KuLEVA
The Laboratory of Mathematical Linguistic S of the Institute
of Mathematics and Mechanics of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences
and the Sector for Automatic Processing of Natural Languages or
the Zentralinstitut air SprachwiRcanschaft of the German Academy
of Sciences are conducting joint winrk on the creation of a model

tific texts. The problem of identifying the Aas is examined in
this work in regard to their selection from the set of potential
antecedents (Ap). It is evident that, for the realization of
this delection, it is necessary to automatically establish before-
hand the set Ap and the working unit (WU) within the framework of
which the maLhine will amass the information necessary to carry
out the indicated selection. This is the subject of the author&apos;s
graduation thesis, which is being carried out in the Sector of
the IMM under the direction of Dr. A Ljudskanov, the basic posi-

The logical content 3f the system is this any WU includes
the two sentences to the left of the sentence in which the cur-
rent P is located, consequently, in order to establish the limits
of the WU, the machine must be in a position to establish sen-
tence boundaries, and for this it must &amp;quot;distinguish&amp;quot; segmenting
punctuation marks from nonsegmenting ones (this task is carried
out in Block 1, which has been worked out with the use of dialog

mechanism) Then the classes of P which are relevant to the

structure, the set of Aps in each WU is automatically disclosed
(this task is fulfilled by Block 4).

THE MODELING OF NONINDIVIDUAL LANGUAGE AGENTS
SLAVCHO PETKOV
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.998061333333334">
in tfte contemporary stage of modeling of language phenomena
the &amp;quot;individualistic&amp;quot; approach is predominant, first of all the
activity of the Individual is modeled--the translation, analysis,
and synthesis of speech, the analysis and generation of the text,
the coding, indexing, classification, and search for documents,
speech patholog.,, compilation of dictionaries, and so on.
The significance of such an approach is beyond doubt, but
together with this, apparently equally timely, is the approach
in which the object of modeling becomes the activity of nonindi-
vidual language agents. Well-known experiments in the given
direction suggest a clarification of a series of theoretical and
methodological problems.
The author distinguishes four types of nonindividual language
agents: binary, group, collective, and complex. In such an ap-
proach the field of mathematical and machine modeling is expanded,
and the transition from complex to super-complex problems is
effected. Inasmuch as these systems are grounded on linguistic
principles, modeling of a special type is held in view (it could
be termed linguonic), in which cybernetic and bionic principles
can be viewed as partial instances.
The report describes the experimentally tested algorithm for
machine processing of data from linguistic experiments which prove
the qualitative distinction between individual and nonindividual
agents in the construction of a text.

Any artificial language, particularly an algorithmic one,
can be viewed as a permissible language (the set of all permis-
sible language elements), as an individual language (the set of
language elements used by the discrete user), and as a collective
language (the set of language elements used by a certain group
of users).
Individual and collective languages may be defined as the
fuzzy sets indicated in the set of permissible language elements
The degree of affinity of a language element to one or an-
other fuzzy set, which corresponds to a certain individual or
collective language, is proportional to the frequency with which
this element is used by the individual and collective users.
The new approach which is proposed for the study of the
properties of individual and collective languages is based on
the theory of fuzzy sets

lating the proposed approach. These metholas alTE illustrated by

A QUANTITATIVE INVESTIGATION OF THE ACTUAL UTILIZATION

P. BYRNJEV
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.987208655172414">
It is characteristic of artificial languages that their
creation precedes their utilization, whereas natural languages
form and develop in the process of their use and under&apos; the influ-
ence of numerous factors, among which the foremost are the users
of the language.
Algorithmic languages and, in particular, programming
languages, constitute an important class of artificial languages
The languages seen below are primarily of this kind
The simplicity, harmony, and completeness of artificial
languages are their essential advantage when they are applied
to special purposes. On the other hand in work with the arti
ficial languages it is impossible to exhaustively foresee which
language elements will be required. For this reason, differences
arise between the requisites of the user and the resources of
the language.
A sharp boundary between artificial and natural languages
does not exist. On the one hand artificial languages also fill
out and develop. On the other hand artificial languages are
used, so to speak, in a &amp;quot;natural&amp;quot; manner. People select certain
permissible langugge eLements. From this point of view, a given
language can be viewe, a permissible language (the set of all
permissible elements) as an individual language (the set of
elements used by the discrete user), and as a collective language
(the set of elements used by a certain group of people) Inas-
much as individual and collective languages (and in the case of
natural languages, permissible ones) are not strictly determined,
it is convenient to employ the mechanism of fuzzy sets.

BASES FOR CONTEXT-FREE LANGUAGES

<bodyText confidence="0.996015625">
This work examines the task of. finding bases for context-
free languages. The location of bases has theoretical and
applied significance. At the time of translation of the pro-
grams of an algorithmic language, the translator in the first
place &apos;edits&apos; the program, exchanging some of the basic symbols
of the language for metalinguist c variables which are defined
by these symbols. In Algol 60 such variables could be &apos;identi-
fier&apos;, &apos;unsigned integer&apos;, &apos;integer&apos;, and so forth The aggre-
gate of these variables and of the remaining basic symbols is
termed the basis. The use of the basis heightens the rapidity
of action of the translator in constructing the syntactic tree
and hence leads to the improvement of some otner characteristics
of the translator.
The concept of the basis of a lnaguage is formally defined
inthework.ThegraphsG.,1 = 1, 2, 3 are defined, linked
with the language&apos;s grammar It is shown that the locaLion of
the bases of a certain special class reduces to the location of
the maximally empty subgraphs of the graph Gi A method is
given for the location of all bases without repetitions. A
modification of this method permits the exposure of only those
bases answering certain conditions. These methods are realized
in the rorm of a program for the Minsk 32 computer. Some
results of the investigation, using this program, of the syntax

The basic question in linguistic research directed toward
the creation of an information language in information-retrieval
type systems is the establishment of an approach serving to ap-
portion the concise material content of language communication
As distinguished from machine translation, the question at hand
is selection of the language material which must be subjected to
processing. If the final record must be not only a coordination
of the terms of the given text, but presumably also a record of
the Syntactic relationships between terms, the corresponding in-
formation language must contain a certain measure of grammatical
analysis. It is assumed that the expression of the communica-
tion&apos; structural relations can proceed from the semantic predi-
cative construction (from the so-called word relations) With
the help of a dictionary of word relations and of grammatical
analysis, the action (with its sphere of valency) is defined in
the role of the center of material information. Actions can be
grouped in broader classes having a general semantic character
in common, the essential quality of such classification is that
verbs belonging to one semantic class have the same type of
actants. The information arrived at permits, besides purely
documentary use of the information, the solution of other, more
complex, problems (automatic abstracting, factographic informati
retrieval, and the like)

It is shownt that the majority of tasks solved in information

an IRS, then the retrieval of object(s) from 6 possessing a cer-
tain combination of signs is reducible to the calculation of the
expressions from d corresponding to this combination. By force
of the large dimensionality of set-expression files, conventional
calculation methods are ineffective.
The proposed algorithm stands out, by way of comparison with
the essential archetypal algorithms, becausetof its better con-
vergence and obviation of the necessity for the storage of inter-
mediate results. This is achieved at the expense of the reorga-
nization of the initial expressions and of the organization on
this basis of a parallel-sequence calculation routine The algo-
rithm has been verified in practice The program module, worked
out by the author for the ISL series 1900 calculating system,

This is a proposal for a specific approach in the creation
of a vocabulary of a descriptor-type information language (IL)
which facilitates the isolation of synonyms, homonyms, etc It
entails the entering of each concept on a separate card, together
with all the words with which it forms word combinations A
principle for creating descriptor-language grammar is being pro-
posed. With this aim, representatives of each group of descrip-
tors (class of concepts) are selected, from which matrices of
the form &amp;quot;ACTION-OBJECT&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;MEANS-ACTION-OBJECT&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;CIRCUMSTANCE-
ACTION-OBJECT&amp;quot; are formed. The matrices enter into the dictionary
pool of the IL in the capacity of lexical units. With the help
of these matrices, all possible logical considerations are
stated which are adequate to the consideration of the concepts.
An algorithm is suggested for indexing the content of
documents and inquiries. A search mode for documents (SMD) and
inquiries (SMI) is created as a chain of elements, the mutual
relations of which are set with the help of matrices. The
matrices are the batic link of the chain, to which are joinea
the usual descriptors elucidating it.
A method is proposed for avoiding parasitic combinations by
utilizing a method of &amp;quot;semantic overlap&amp;quot; in the creation of the
SMD, i.e. the SMD is created from the successively arranged
elements, the neighbors of which encompass one identical concept.
The IA vocabulary is grouped into the facets &amp;quot;MEANS&apos;
&amp;quot;OBJECTS&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;CIRCUMSTANCES&amp;quot;, and so forth
The advantages of the approach outlined are as follows

with the user is shown, as well as its influence on the search.
Reverse communication with the user is examined from the
point of view of two procedures--a presearch procedure (compila-
tion of search instructions up to the execution of the search
process) and a postsearch procedure (the compilation of final
search instructions after computer processing results have been
received). The stages and forms of these two procedures in the
AIRS and the possibility of future transition to dialog with the
computer are indicated.

The report describes a model for automatic indexing and
ciassification of documenLs and for the inquiries in information
systems that operate in dialog mode. The model is built as a set
of modules that realize the following functions
automatic translation of the content of documents
(synopses) into a descriptor-type information-
retrieval language with grammar
automatic classification of documents (synopses)
automatic reception ot a field of ordered structures
of standard thematic inquiries
automatic translation of the content of inquiries into a
descriptor-type IR language with grammar
automatic classification of inquiries into a field of
ordered structures of standard thematic inquiries
retrieval of relevant documents (in dialog mode)
The realization of the model in its original form was carried out
on an ASVT M-2000 computer on a file of texts (about 2000 3ynopses)
along the theme &amp;quot;Automatic Control Systems and Calculating Tech-
niques&amp;quot; and produced a positive result. An analysis of the re-
sults received from the operation of the model has permitted
further expansion of its functions The classification module
that has been worked out is based not on the a priori classifica-
tidn of the acquired knowledge, but on the descriptor description
of documents and inquiries which matkes possible the multi-level
reception with the input of the next portion of documents and
inquiries. Besides that, the use of grammatical means in indexing
(indices of connection) significantly improves the infornation

A THESAURUS FROM THE POSITION OF A SYSTEMS APPROACH
V. PEJCHEVA AND S. GABROVSKA
The systems approach, as a universal method, can be success-
fully used in the consideration of a thesaurus as systems of
categories and concepts with fixed semantic linkages between them.
From the point of view of the systems approach, a thesaurus pos-
sesses the following system-forming characteristics Content--
the elements of a thesaurus, i.e. its dictionary composition,
including the idea of a certain field of knowledge or practical
activity; Relational composition--the links unifying its compo-
nents into a whole. The thesaurus&apos;s relations of interdependence
are considered gender-aspectual (gender-aspect and aspect-gender)
and the portion of associative linkages, and the relations of
determination are considered the associative linkages of the
.r.ason-consequence type. Pertaining to descriptors which lack
genetic or associative linkages among themselves, it can be said
that they .mre in the relationship of constellation, since they
are combined within the framework of the system, The function of
the thesaurus--its ability to serve as the major component part
in a system of higher order, an infonnation-retrieval system,
The management of the thesaurus--the process of its improvement
by means of changes in its content, s:ructure, and relations.
In constructing the thesaurus, one must heed the demands of
the system&apos;s methodology, for integrity, compatibility of com-
ponents (especially urgent in the development of polythematic
thesauri), horizontal and vertical decomposition of the system,
minimization of the interaction of different subsystems, etc

The report examines a sequence for the formation of a the-
saurus in information-retrieval systems. This task consumes time
and labor in large quantity, and the possibilities of its facili-
tation by means of partially automated work on thesaurus formation
are being examined. Toward this aim information files have been
defined, and a set of algorithms and corresponding programs has
been worked out allowing the automation of the most time-consuming
operations in the creation of the thesaurus (the creation or a
dictionary of word-fcrms and word-combinations, alphabetic and
frequency ordering, verification and correction of the dictionary,
evaluation of the semantic bonds between descriptors, verifica-
tion of the classification routine, the statistical profile of
the dictionary composition, etc.)
The progrpms are written in FORTRAN IV and intended for
the ISL 1904A computer.
The programs which have been worked out are universally
applicable to the formation of thesauri and various types of
dictionaries. In the given instance, they are utilized for the
creation of an economic information thesaurus in compliance with
the proposed sequence of its construction

doctments and inquiries in different natural languages The rea-
lization of bilingua_ input is founded on certain informatic media
and mathematical program realization
I. The informatic media 1. The standard forms -of infor-

of the factological portions of the ICs and IBs is effectuated
on the basis of code catalogs. 3 The resume (annotations) and
questions are processed with the help of a bilingual (multilingual)
descriptor dictionary in which the pairs, triplets, etc.
ferent-language descriptors are linked by a general code

II. The mathematical program realization includes
grams for farming code catalogs and a machine descriptor
ary, a program for automated indexing, and a program for

only the indexing program requires some changes in connection

Stage II of language compilation Based on the paradigmatic
comparison of the lexical meanings of natural-language words
(synonymy, gender, aspect, and so forth, the FP thesaurus has
been compiled. 235 semantic groups (SG) have been singled out
comprising 800 different words. AN SG contains two or more words
having one and the same elementary meaning (EM). The artificial
designation of an SG, i.e the EM, is the root of the artificial-
language word Furthermore paradigmatic relations (gender and
so on) have been established between roots (ESs). The gender
roots of a given root are called prefixes of the artificial word
Besides prefixes, two numerical suffixes are appended to the
root; the first indicates the form of connection of the concrete
natural-language word within the framework of the SG, the second
indicates the grammatical role of the given word (adjective,
gender, number, etc )
In this fashion if one natural-language word enters into
several SG&apos;s, it then has several ESs

The construction of the method is based on the ideas of logical semantics, mathematical logic, and the sothesaurus approach. logical bases are given with the of axioms of semantic and their and hence semantic is described in setfashion. The natural language the to.Le of object language; proceeding from it a formal language is constructed is conditionally termed an algebraic (Al) language; this is the fragmentary metalanguage defined by the of the object translation of texts this language into the language (i.e. compilation of expre-sions) allows the determination the quantity of information in object-language texts.

General 8 DISCRETE CALCULATION OF ENTROPY IVAN DOBREV L. Hartley (1928) introduced the following mathematical expression of entropy H. Ili= log n, where n is the number of equiprobable experimental outcomes This formula can be only as a postulate and by no as a formal, logical conclusion from more elementary proposals, since there an error in Hartley&apos;s chain deductions. From the mathematical point of view, the conclusion of.C. Shannon (1942) that H = log n is fully rigorous, but it is the consequence of very strong preliminary assumptions (axioms) on entropy as a function of the number of equiprobable outcomes n According to Shannon, function H = be a continuous, additive and monoton continuity and additivity are not necessary The identification of n equiprobable outcomes of the experiment by the method of binary questions is a discrete process. A simple experiment with n = kl equiprobable outcomes and a sequence of two simple experiments with k and 1 equiprobable outcomes are two different things. that entr6py is the of the average quantity of binary questions necessary for the identification of one of the equiprobable ouLcome of the experiment we set (1)(1) = 0 and recurrence relation (1)(n) = 1 + for all even values = 1 + + n+1 n+1 2 ) for all odd values. z.n verified that cp(n) and that the difference does not exceed 0.09 Using the definition of the function (1)(n) and approximation q(n) with an absolute error 0 &apos;09, one may calculate the entropy of the experiment with independent but equiprobable results.

The mathematical model reveals a lnaguage to be a system of structures and mechanisms, the function oE which obeys the laws of thought. Such regularities in the internal Logic are observed in Bulgarian in mutually conditioned changes, within the framework of each complex pair of alternating consonants and vowels. regularities can serve as criterion in creating a model of human speech activity, which can be utilized in the creation of a scientifically based theory, both for stenography and for the creation of a machine for recording of speech. The mathematical model of Bulgarian phonetics for the complex pairs of alternating consonants and vowels can be examined dialectically, i.e. in its unity and contradiction In such a case it can be bifurcated into two consonants or into two vowels with contrastive structures, which are located between each other in a certain congeneric linkage.

We have analyzed a Kusstan text and Its Bulgarian translation (Young World Fiction Writers, a Collection of stories and Tales, a Selection from Iv. Ruzh, &amp;quot;Folk Culture&amp;quot;, Sofia, 1963) length of the original is 44,000 word-uses, translation, 50,000 word uses.

The difference numbers is an indication the function of indicating perin the formation of verb-forms is weakenedin Bulgarian pronouns. If one addresses attention the instances of the pleonastic use of pronouns (nego go, nas ni, etc ) to the reprise of nouns (Az Mayakovski go etc then the divergence in frequencies appears even more significant A chi-square test shows that the divergence between frequencies first and second person singular pronouns in the is significantfor the two languages, and in the oblique cases not significant. The personal endings of the verb show the person of the subject. This is why the difference in frequencies is reached at the expense of the nominative case The third person singular pronoun functions in Bulgarian a little differently than in Russian, in the oblique cases, &amp;quot;toj&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;tya&amp;quot; are usedmare frequently than their Russian z::ounterparts. The frequency of the dative analytic is too insignifiCant; we encountered only 29 forms.

For this reason, differences arise between the requisites of the user and the resources of the language. A sharp boundary between artificial and natural languages does not exist.

With this aim, representatives of each group of descriptors (class of concepts) are selected, from which matrices of the form &amp;quot;ACTION-OBJECT&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;MEANS-ACTION-OBJECT&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;CIRCUMSTANCE- ACTION-OBJECT&amp;quot; are formed. The matrices enter into the dictionary pool of the IL in the capacity of lexical units. With the help of these matrices, all possible logical considerations are stated which are adequate to the consideration of the concepts. An algorithm is suggested for indexing the content of documents and inquiries. A search mode for documents (SMD) and inquiries (SMI) is created as a chain of elements, the mutual relations of which are set with the help of matrices. The matrices are the batic link of the chain, to which are joinea the usual descriptors elucidating it.

Pertaining to descriptors which lack genetic or associative linkages among themselves, it can be said that they .mre in the relationship of constellation, since they combined within the framework of the system, function of ability to serve as the major component part in a system of higher order, an infonnation-retrieval system, of the process of its improvement by means of changes in its content, s:ructure, and relations. In constructing the thesaurus, one must heed the demands of system&apos;s for integrity, compatibility of components (especially urgent in the development of polythematic thesauri), horizontal and vertical decomposition of the system, minimization of the interaction of different subsystems, etc A SET OF ALGORITHMS AND PROGRAMS FOR AUTOMATED IN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL ANGEL MARCHEV report examines a sequence for formation of a thein information-retrieval systems. This time and labor in large quantity, and the possibilities of its faciliby means of partially automated work on are being examined. Toward this aim information files have been defined, and a set of algorithms and corresponding programs has been worked out allowing the automation of the most time-consuming in the creation of the thesaurus (the creation dictionary of word-fcrms and word-combinations, alphabetic and verification correction of the dictionary, evaluation of the semantic bonds between descriptors, verificaof routine, profile of dictionary etc.) The progrpms are written in FORTRAN IV and intended for the ISL 1904A computer. which have been worked out are universally to the formation of and types of In the given instance, are utilized for the of economic information thesaurus with the proposed sequence of its construction Documentation 46 SYSTEMS WITH BILINGUAL INPUT A. LJUDSKANOV (multilingual) input into autamd systems (AIRS) makez possible the processing of documents in different languages without the creation of many systems or even the preliminary translation from a foreign language into the na tional one. The problem of bilingual (multilingual) input to an AIRS presents itself in connection with automated indexing of doctments and inquiries in different natural languages The realization of bilingua_ input is founded on certain informatic media and mathematical program realization The informatic media1. The standard forms -of mation cards (IC) of documents and of information blanks (IB) of questions are coded with a special code (0 and 1) for the guarantee of automatic selection of the file (Bulgarian and Russian) given in the corresponding natural language 2 The of the factological portions of the ICs and IBs is effectuated on the basis of code catalogs. 3 The resume (annotations) questions are processed with the help of a bilingual (multilingual) descriptor dictionary in which the pairs, triplets, etc. ferent-language descriptors are linked by a general code metalanguage of the system The mathematical program realizationincludes grams for farming code catalogs and a machine descriptor ary, a program for automated indexing, and a program for of difto the prodictionhhe search and delivery of responses The first experiments have shown that only the indexing program requires some changes in connection with the discrimination of the constants of the different natural languages. The block organization of the program makes possible with the help of a key the activation of that block which is necessary for the processiqg of the text in the corresponding language. Documentatwz2 47 III. The automated information-retrieval system of the Institute of Radioelectronics is in the experimental phase with the goal of including Russian input The collective is also carrying on preliminary investigations toward the realization of tertiary English input into the system Documentation 48 INTERACIum LN THE SYSTEM SYSTEM&amp;quot; NIKOLA RAJKOVSKI the process of inrormation service between tne information user and the information-retrieval system (IRS), certain informational-linguistic interactions (ILI) are established flow within the framework of the following systems 1. The information-retrieval language YaS1 in contact with information files the of the semantic content inquiries and The user language YaS2 in contact with the system (comand of the process of retrieving and processing information. The programming language YaS3 according to the formulaand transcription of processes in the solution of information tasks in the computer. 4. The natural language YaS4 in user-contact with tne information in the system. The following aspects of the ILls are examined 1 The semantic aspect--the semantic content of the TLI is formulated in terms of YaS1 The program presence of program media in carrying out the commands of communication and control by processes it the computer. The pragmatic aspect--the satisfaction of the information needs which are the goal and the sources of interaction. 4. The organizational-technical aspect--the ILI is carried in given structure with the help of certain technical means THE NEW INFORMATION LANGUAGE &amp;quot;POLITIKA&amp;quot; GEORGIEV I of language compilation.As a result of a statistical inspection of Bulgarian foreign-policy texts, 50,000 word forms in length, frequency and reverse-frequency dictionaries hare De.en compiled The 10,000 word forms entered cover the foreign-policy texts to 907. Both dictionaries have permitted the transition to the study of lexical and morphological semantics of the foreign-policy (FP) vocabulary on the paradigmatic plane II of language compilationBased on the paradigmatic comparison of the lexical meanings of natural-language words (synonymy, gender, aspect, and so forth, the FP thesaurus has been compiled. 235 semantic groups (SG) have been singled out comprising 800 different words. AN SG contains two or more words having one and the same elementary meaning (EM). The artificial of an SG, i.e the EM, is the rootof the artificiallanguage word Furthermore paradigmatic relations (gender and so on) have been established between roots (ESs). The gender roots of a given root are called prefixes of the artificial word Besides prefixes, two numerical suffixes are appended to the root; the first indicates the form of connection of the concrete natural-language word within the framework of the SG, the second indicates the grammatical role of the given word (adjective, gender, number, etc ) In this fashion if one natural-language word enters into several SG&apos;s, it then has several ESs The information language Politika is a language of indirect documentation, descriptor type (having two layers of vocabulary), with grammar, branched and, to the extent of synthesis, synthetic On the basis of the description which has been carried out the FP vocabulary, algorithms have been drawn up for the automatic translation of text from natural language to the artificial language Politika (including algorithms for the removal of polysemanticity in natural-language words and algorithms for the automatic recognition of the semantic form on the level of indexing, annotation, and synopsis.</abstract>
