In conversation, when speech is followed by
a backchannel, evidence of continued engage-
ment by one’s dialogue partner, that speech
displays a combination of cues that appear to
signal to one’s interlocutor that a backchan-
nel is appropriate. We term these cues back-
channel-preceding cues (BPC)s, and examine
the Columbia Games Corpus for evidence of
entrainment on such cues. Entrainment, the
phenomenon of dialogue partners becoming
more similar to each other, is widely believed
to be crucial to conversation quality and suc-
cess. Our results show that speaking partners
entrain on BPCs; that is, they tend to use simi-
lar sets of BPCs; this similarity increases over
the course of a dialogue; and this similarity is
associated with measures of dialogue coordi-
nation and task success.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.989286217391305">
In conversation, dialogue partners often become
more similar to each other. This phenomenon,
known in the literature as entrainment, alignment,
accommodation, or adaptation has been found to
occur along many acoustic, prosodic, syntactic and
lexical dimensions in both human-human interac-
tions (Brennan and Clark, 1996; Coulston et al.,
2002; Reitter et al., 2006; Ward and Litman,
2007; Niederhoffer and Pennebaker, 2002; Ward and
Mamidipally, 2008; Buder et al., 2010) and human-
computer interactions (Brennan, 1996; Bell et al.,
2000; Stoyanchev and Stent, 2009; Bell et al., 2003)
and has been associated with dialogue success and
naturalness (Pickering and Garrod, 2004; Goleman,
113
2006; Nenkova et al., 2008). That is, interlocutors
who entrain achieve better communication. How-
ever, the question of how best to measure this phe-
nomenon has not been well established. Most re-
search has examined similarity of behavior over a
conversation, or has compared similarity in early
and later phases of a conversation; more recent work
has proposed new metrics of synchrony and conver-
gence (Edlund et al., 2009) and measures of similar-
ity at a more local level (Heldner et al., 2010).
While a number of dimensions of potential en-
trainment have been studied in the literature, en-
trainment in turn-taking behaviors has received lit-
tle attention. In this paper we examine entrainment
in a novel turn-taking dimension: backchannel-
preceding cues (BPC)s.1 Backchannels are short
segments of speech uttered to signal continued in-
terest and understanding without taking the floor
(Schegloff, 1982). In a study of the Columbia
Games Corpus, Gravano and Hirschberg (2009;
2011) identify five speech phenomena that are
significantly correlated with speech followed by
backchannels. However, they also note that indi-
vidual speakers produced different combinations of
these cues and varied the way cues were expressed.
In our work, we look for evidence that speaker pairs
negotiate the choice of such cues and their realiza-
tions in a conversation – that is, they entrain to one
another in their choice and production of such cues.
We test for evidence both at the global and at the
local level.

1Prior studies termed cues that precede backchannels, back-
channel-inviting cues. To avoid suggesting that such cues are a
speaker’s conscious decision, we adopt a more neutral term.

In Section 2, we describe the Columbia Games
Corpus, on which the current analysis was con-
ducted. In Section 3, we present three measures of
BPC entrainment. In Section 4, we further show that
two of these measures also correlate with dialogue
coordination and task success.

2 The Columbia Games Corpus
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999587130434783">
The Columbia Games Corpus is a collection of 12
spontaneous dyadic conversations elicited from na-
tive speakers of Standard American English. 13 peo-
ple participated in the collection of the corpus. 11
participated in two sessions, each time with a dif-
ferent partner. Subjects were separated by a curtain
to ensure that all communication was verbal. They
played a series of computer games requiring collab-
oration in order to achieve a high score.
The corpus consists of 9h 8m of speech. It is
orthographically transcribed and annotated for var-
ious types of turn-taking behavior, including smooth
switches (cases in which one speaker completes her
turn and another speaker takes the floor), interrup-
tions (cases in which one speaker breaks in, leaving
the interlocutor’s turn incomplete), and backchan-
nels. There are 5641 exchanges in the corpus; of
these, approximately 58% are smooth switches, 2%
are interruptions, and 11% are backchannels. Other
turn types include overlaps and pause interruptions;
a full description of the Columbia Games Corpus’
annotation for turn-taking behavior can be found in
(Gravano and Hirschberg, 2011).

3 Evidence of entrainment
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.95325296">
Gravano and Hirschberg (2009; 2011) identify five
cues that tend to be present in speech preceding
backchannels. These cues, and the features that
model them, are listed in Table 1. The likelihood
that a segment of speech will be followed by a
backchannel increases quadratically with the num-
ber of cues present in the speech. However, they
note that individual speakers may display different
combinations of cues. Furthermore, the realization
of a cue may differ from speaker to speaker. We hy-
pothesize that speaker pairs adopt a common set of
cues to which each will respond with a backchan-
nel. We look for evidence for this hypothesis us-
ing three different measures of entrainment. Two of
Cue Feature
Intonation pitch slope over the IPU-
final 200 and 300 ms
Pitch mean pitch over the final
500 and 1000 ms
Intensity mean intensity over the
final 500 and 1000 ms
Duration IPU duration in seconds
and word count
Voice quality NHR over the final 500
and 1000 ms

<bodyText confidence="0.999817388888889">
these measures capture entrainment globally, over
the course of an entire dialogue, while the third
looks at entrainment on a local level. The unit of
analysis we employ for each experiment is an inter-
pausal unit (IPU), defined as a pause-free segment
of speech from a single speaker, where pause is de-
fined as a silence of 50ms or more from the same
speaker. We term consecutive pairs of IPUs from
a single speaker holds, and contrast hold-preceding
IPUs with backchannel-preceding IPUs to isolate
cues that are significant in preceding backchannels.
That is, when a speaker pauses without giving up
the turn, which IPUs are followed by backchannels
and which are not? We consider a speaker to use
a certain BPC if, for any of the features model-
ing that cue, the difference between backchannel-
preceding IPUs and hold-preceding IPUs is signif-
icant (ANOVA, p &lt; 0.05).

3.1 Entrainment measure 1: Common cues
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999860357142857">
For our first entrainment metric, we measure the
similarity of two speakers’ cue sets by simply count-
ing the number of cues that they have in common
over the entire conversation. We hypothesize that
speaker pairs will use similar sets of cues.
The speakers in our corpus each displayed 0 to 5
of the BPCs described in Table 1 (mean = 2.17). The
number of cues speaker pairs had in common ranged
from 0 to 4 (out of a maximum of 5). Let 51 and 52
be two speakers in a given dialogue, and n1,2 the
number of BPCs they had in common. Let also n1,*
and n*,2 be the mean number of cues 51 and 52 had
in common with all other speakers in the corpus not
partnered with them in any session. For all 12 dia-

logues in the corpus, we pair n1,2 both with n1,∗ and
with n∗,2, and run a paired t-test. The results indi-
cate that, on average, the speakers had significantly
more cues in common with their interlocutors than
with other speakers in the corpus (t = 2.1, df = 23,
p &lt; 0.05).
These findings support our hypothesis that speak-
er pairs negotiate common sets of cues, and suggest
that, like other aspects of conversation, speaker vari-
ation in use of BPCs is not simply an expression of
personal behavior, but is at least partially the result
of coordination with a conversational partner.

3.2 Entrainment measure 2: BPC realization
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999561424242424">
With our second measure, we look for evidence that
the speakers’ actual values for the cue features are
similar: that not only do they alter their production
of similar feature sets when preceding a backchan-
nel, they also alter their productions in similar ways.
We measure how similarly two speakers 51 and
52 in a conversation realize a BPC as follows:
First, we compute the difference (df1,2) between both
speakers for the mean value of a feature f over
all backchannel-preceding IPUs. Second, we com-
pute the same difference between each of 51 and 52
and the averaged values of all other speakers in the
corpus who are not partnered with that speaker in
any session (df1,∗ and df∗,2). Finally, if for any fea-
ture f modeling a given cue, it holds that df1,2 &lt;
min(df1,∗, df∗,2), we say that that session exhibits
mutual entrainment on that cue.
Eleven out of 12 sessions exhibit mutual entrain-
ment on pitch and intensity, 9 exhibit mutual entrain-
ment on voice quality, 8 on intonation, and 7 on du-
ration. Interestingly, the only session not entrain-
ing on intensity is the only session not entraining
on pitch, but the relationships between the different
types of entrainment is not readily observable.
For each of the 10 features associated with
backchannel invitation, we compare the differences
between conversational partners (df1,2) and the aver-
aged differences between each speaker and the other
speakers in the corpus (df1,∗ and df∗,2). Paired t-tests
(Table 2) show that the differences in intensity, pitch
and voice quality in backchannel-preceding IPUs
are smaller between conversational partners than be-
tween speakers and their non-partners in the corpus.

<bodyText confidence="0.999949545454545">
The differences between interlocutor and their
non-partners in features modeling pitch show that
there is no single “optimal” value for a pitch level
that precedes a backchannel; this value is coordi-
nated between partners on a pair-by-pair basis. Sim-
ilarly, while varying intensity or voice quality may
be considered a universal cue for a backchannel, the
specific values of the production appear to be a mat-
ter of coordination between individual speaker pairs.
While some views of entrainment hold that coor-
dination takes place at the very beginning of a dia-
logue, others hypothesize that coordination contin-
ues to improve over the course of the conversation.
T-tests for difference of means show that indeed
the differences between conversational partners in
mean pitch and intensity in the final 1000 millisec-
onds of backchannel-preceding IPUs are smaller in
the second half of the conversation than in the first
(t = 3.44, 2.17; df = 23; p &lt; 0.05, 0.01), indicat-
ing that entrainment in this dimension is an ongoing
process that results in closer alignment after the in-
terlocutors have been speaking for some time.

Measures 1 and 2 capture global entrainment and
can be used to characterize an entire dialogue with
respect to entrainment. We now look for evidence
to support the hypothesis that a speaker’s realization
of BPCs influences how her interlocutor produces
BPCs. To capture this, we compile a list of pairs
of backchannel-preceding IPUs, in which the second
member of each pair follows the first in the conver-

sation and is produced by a different speaker. For
each feature, we calculate the Pearson’s correlation
between acoustic variables extracted from the first
element of each pair and the second.
The correlations for mean pitch and intensity are
significant (r = 0.3, two-sided t-test: p &lt; 0.05, in
both cases). Other correlations are not significant.
These results suggest that entrainment on pitch and
intensity at least is a localized phenomenon. Spoken
dialogue systems may exploit this information, mod-
ifying their output to invite a backchannel similar to
the user’s own previous backchannel invitation.

4 Correlation with dialogue coordination
and task success
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999543555555556">
Entrainment is widely believed to be crucial to dia-
logue coordination. In the specific case of BPC en-
trainment, it seems intuitive that some consensus on
BPCs should be integral to the successful coordina-
tion of a conversation. Long latencies (periods of si-
lence) before backchannels can be considered a sign
of poor coordination, as when a speaker is waiting
for an indication that his partner is still attending,
and the partner is slow to realize this. Similarly,
interruptions signal poor coordination, as when a
speaker has not finished what he has to say, but his
partner thinks it is her turn to speak. We thus use
mean backchannel latency and proportion of inter-
ruptions as measures of coordination of whole ses-
sions. We use the combined score of the games the
subjects played as a measure of task success. We
correlate all three with our two global entrainment
scores and report correlation coefficients in Table 3.

Our first metric for identifying entrainment, Mea-
sure 1, the number of cues the speaker pair has in
common, is negatively correlated with mean latency
and proportion of interruptions, our two measures of
poor coordination. Its correlation with score, though
not significant, is positive. So, more entrainment in
BPCs under Measure 1 means smaller latency before
backchannels and fewer interruptions, while there
is a tendency for such entrainment to be associated
with higher scores.
Our second entrainment metric, Measure 2, cap-
tures the similarities between speaker means of the
10 features associated with BPCs. To test correla-
tions of this measure with task success, we collapse
the ten features into a single measure by taking the
negated Euclidean distance between each speaker
pair’s 2 vectors of means; this measure tells us how
close these speakers are across all features exam-
ined. Under this analysis, we find that Measure 2
is negatively correlated with mean latency and pos-
itively correlated with score. Both correlations are
strong and highly significant. Again, the correlation
with interruptions is negative, although not signifi-
cant. Thus, more entrainment defined by this metric
means shorter latency between turns, fewer interrup-
tions, and again and more strongly, higher scores.
We thus find that, the more entrainment at the
global level, the better the coordination between the
partners and the better their performance on their
joint task. These results provide evidence of the im-
portance of BPC entrainment to dialogue.

5 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999482235294118">
In this paper we discuss the role of entrainment
in turn-taking behavior and its impact on conversa-
tional coordination and task success in the Columbia
Games Corpus. We examine a novel form of en-
trainment, entrainment in BPCs – characteristics of
speech segments that are followed by backchannels
from the interlocutor. We employ three measures
of entrainment – two global and one local – and
find evidence of entrainment in all three. We also
find correlations between our two global entrain-
ment measures and conversational coordination and
task success. In future, we will extend this analysis
to the complementary turn-taking category of turn-
yielding cues and explore how a spoken dialogue
system may take advantage of information about en-
trainment to improve dialogue coordination and the
user experience.

In our work, we look for evidence that speaker pairs negotiate the choice of such cues and their realizations in a conversation – that is, they entrain to one another in their choice and production of such cues.

These cues, and the features that model them, are listed in Table 1. The likelihood that a segment of speech will be followed by a backchannel increases quadratically with the number of cues present in the speech.

This phenomenon, known in the literature as entrainment, alignment, accommodation, or adaptation has been found to occur along many acoustic, prosodic, syntactic and lexical dimensions in both human-human interactions (Brennan and Clark, 1996; Coulston et al., 2002; Reitter et al., 2006; Ward and Litman, 2007; Niederhoffer and Pennebaker, 2002; Ward and Mamidipally, 2008; Buder et al., 2010) and humancomputer interactions (Brennan, 1996; Bell et al., 2000; Stoyanchev and Stent, 2009; Bell et al., 2003) and has been associated with dialogue success and naturalness (Pickering and Garrod, 2004; Goleman, 113 2006; Nenkova et al., 2008). That is, interlocutors who entrain achieve better communication. However, the question of how best to measure this phenomenon has not been well established. Most research has examined similarity of behavior over a conversation, or has compared similarity in early and later phases of a conversation; more recent work has proposed new metrics of synchrony and convergence (Edlund et al., 2009) and measures of similarity at a more local level (Hel</context>
