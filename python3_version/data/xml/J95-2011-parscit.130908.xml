<bodyText confidence="0.980876928571429">
The Minimalist Program consists of
four recent essays that attempt to
situate linguistic theory in the
broader cognitive sciences. Building
on the theory of principles and
parameters, the minimalist frame-
work takes Universal Grammar as
providing a unique computational
system, with derivations driven by
morphological properties, to which
the syntactic variation of languages is
also restricted.

Linguistics and
Philosophy
A Journal of Natural Language
Syntax, Semantics, Logic,
Pragmatics, and Processing
Editor-in-Chief: Gregory N. Carlson
Linguistics and Philosophy is a journal for studies focused on Journal
natural language, and is of interest to practitioners in the
disciplines covered in the title. Although the field thus described Highlight
is so extensive that a complete listing of relevant topics is
precluded, at least the following specifically fall within it:
- traditional areas in the philosophy of language such as
meaning, truth, reference, description, entailment, speech acts
- traditional areas of linguistics such as syntax, semantics and
pragmatics (when the studies are of sufficient explicitness and
generality to be also of philosophical interest)
-aspects of artificial intelligence concerned with language such
as computational linguistics and natural language processing
- systems of logicwith strong connections to natural language:
modal logic, tense logic, epistemic logic, intensional logic -
philosophical questions raised by linguistics as a science:
linguistics methodology, the status of linguistics theories, the
nature of linguistic universals
- philosophically interesting problems at the intersection of
linguistics and other disciplines: language acquisition, lan-
guage and perception, language as a social convention.
Linguistics and Philosophy is abstracted/indexed in Bulletin

<bodyText confidence="0.996798464285714">
The mission of the Journal of Intelligent Information Systems: Integrat-
ing Artifical Intelligence and Database Technologies is to present
research and development focused on the integration of Artificial
Intelligence and Database Management technologies to provide mod-
els, architectures, tools and techniques for the next generation of
systems - Intelligent Information Systems. The Journal of Intelligent
Information Systems is a technical journal that focuses on the creation
of information systems that exhibit intelligent behavior and embody
intelligence in their reasoning and management processes.
Increasingly, knowledge-directed inference processes are being used
to produce information from the data contained in large shared
databases. The goal of the Journal of Intelligent Information Systems
is to provide a forum for those interested in making information systems
intelligent in which they can publish their original research and devel-
opment results. For us, intelligence may be manifested in a user
interface which has knowledge of user profiles and preferences and
can use this knowledge to foster more productive human-computer
interactions; intelligence may be embodied in the loosely or tightly-
coupled architectures for integrating knowledge-based systems with
database systems; and intelligence may reside in query optimization
algorithms that incorporate semantic integrity constraints, heuristics
as well as database statistics. Journal of Intelligent Information
Systems is an archival, peer-reviewed, technical journal publishing the
following types of high-quality, state-of-the-art papers: - research
papers - invited papers - workshop and conference reports - survey
and tutorial articles - book reviews. In addition to papers Journal of
Intelligent Information Systems also presents: - meeting announce- Kluwer
ments - reviews - open problems and proposed solutions. academic

Peter Gardenfors
Dept. of Philosophy, Lund University, Sweden Journal
This is the official publication of the European Association for Logic, Highlight
Language, and Information.
The scope of the journal is the logical and computational foundations
of natural, formal, and programming languages, as well as the different
forms of human and mechanized inference. It covers the logical,
linguistic, and information-theoretic parts of the cognitive sciences.
Examples of main subareas are Intensional Logics including Dynamic
Logic; Nonmonotonic Logic and Belief Revision; Constructive Logics;
Complexity Issues in Logic and Linguistics; Theoretical Problems of
Logic Programming and Resolution; Categorial Grammar and Type
Theory; Generalized Quantification; Information-Oriented Theories of
Semantic Structure like Situation Semantics, Discourse Representa-
tion Theory, and Dynamic Semantics; Connectionist Models of Logical
and Linguistic Structures. The emphasis is on the theoretical aspects
of these areas.
The purpose of the journal is to act as a forum for researchers
interested in the theoretical foundations of the above subjects and their
interdisciplinary connections, with an emphasis on general ideas
increasing coherence.

Membership in the Association for Computational Linguistics is for the calendar year, regardless of when dues are paid. Membership
includes a full year of the ACL journal Computational Linguistics, reduced registration at mostACL-sponsored conferences, and discounts
on ACL-sponsored publications. A late payment fee will be charged for renewals received after 1 April; this fee does not apply to new
members. Institutions subscribe to the journal through MIT Press Journals, 55 Hayward Street, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; +1-617-253-
2889 phone; 258-6779 fax; journals-orders@mitedu email. Back issues and proceedings are available only from the ACL, except that
institutions should backorder journals for 1988 and following years through MIT Press. Payments for dues, back issues, and proceedings
can be made in Europe and Japan as well as the U.S. Read the directions under the heading PAYMENT below carefully. Identify
institutional affiliation, if it is not part ofyour address. Also provide telephone country &amp; region codes and e-mail address, even if you have
done so before Write legibly. please!

Guidelines for Submissions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.966758">
Manuscripts for Computational Linguistics should be submitted on letter-size paper (8.5 by
11 inches, or A4), double-spaced throughout, including footnotes and references. The paper
should begin with an informative abstract of approximately 150-250 words. Manuscripts must
be written in English. Contact the editor regarding the possibility of electronic submission.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.741417">
Submissions may be made in any of the following categories:
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9970904375">
Papers: This category includes contributions that report significant new research results in com-
putational linguistics or that provide critical reviews of the literature on a particular topic. The
length of a paper depends on its content, but it is suggested that manuscripts be limited to forty
double-spaced pages. That is the equivalent of thirty journal pages. Each paper is fully refereed,
being read by at least two members of the editorial board and usually by an additional expert
in the particular subject area. The submission of an article to CL for refereeing means that the
author certifies the manuscript is not copyrighted; nor has it been published or submitted for
publication to another refereed journal. If any version of the paper has appeared, or will appear,
in a non-refereed publication, the details of such publication must be made known to the Edi-
tor at the time of submission. The final version of a paper tentatively accepted for publication
must be accompanied by a Copyright Transfer Agreement signed by all of the authors or, in the
case of a &amp;quot;work for hire,&amp;quot; by the employer. This written transfer is necessary under the 1978
U.S. Copyright law.
Letters to the Editor: This category includes statements of opinion on issues relevant to the
readership. The Editor and the editorial board will evaluate the appropriateness of these con-
tributions for inclusion.

Founded in 1962, the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) is the primary scientific and
professional society for natural language processing research and applications. A European chapter was
established in 1982. Besides publishing Computational Linguistics, the ACL holds international meetings
(annually in North America, biennially in Europe) where the state-of-the-art in natural language
processing research and development is presented. Recently, special interest groups on the Mathematics of
Language, the Lexicon, Parsing, Generation, Computational Phonology, and Multimedia Language
Processing have been formed; others are likely to be added.
