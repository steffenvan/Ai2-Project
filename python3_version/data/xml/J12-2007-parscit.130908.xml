Bitext alignment techniques are at the heart of the revolution that swept through the
field of machine translation (MT) two decades ago. From the early attempts of pioneers
like Kay and R¨oscheisen (1993), to the recent success of [enter name of your current
favorite alignment method or researcher], the growth of translation alignment is so tightly
intertwined with that of statistical machine translation that it is actually difficult (and
most likely futile) to try to establish which was most instrumental to which. From the
beginning, researchers have been attracted by the alignment problem, not only because
of its essential link to MT and the numerous other applications that could be derived,
but also because bitext alignment seems like a “neat” problem: one around which a
researcher can easily wrap his or her head until a clean solution emerges.
Of course, this neatness is mostly illusory, as many researchers eventually found
out, and all these “possible” links in publicly available reference alignments are wit-
nesses to the fact that translation alignment is not a perfectly well defined problem,
and that explaining the subtle ways in which identical concepts are rendered across
languages by drawing lines between words is an oversimplification, to say the least.
In spite of this, Tiedemann’s book is a timely addition to the natural language
processing literature. After going through the motivations in Chapter 1, he introduces
the basic concepts and terminology in Chapter 2, discusses various alignment types,
models and search procedures, and presents the fundamentals of alignment evaluation.
Of particular interest is the discussion on the crucial role played by the segmentation
of the text into the units on which the alignment will operate. The process of collecting
and structuring parallel corpora is briefly outlined in Chapter 3.
In Chapter 4, Tiedemann gets to the heart of the matter with sentence-level align-
ment. Following a more-or-less historical line, he first covers approaches based on
surface features (sentence lengths, alignment type), a` la Gale and Church (1993), then
methods relying on lexical resources, before looking at combined and resource-specific
methods.
Chapter 5 covers word-alignment techniques. As one would expect, it makes up a
sizeable portion of the book (about a third). Half of this chapter is devoted to generative
translation models (essentially, the IBM models), the other half to various discriminative
models. Finally, Chapter 6 rapidly surveys phrase and tree alignment models.
Overall, Tiedemann’s book covers a lot of ground, possibly a bit too much. This is a
vast field, which has seen the publication of hundreds (thousands?) of publications over
the last 20 years or so. The author clearly knows his stuff, and manages to structure
its presentation in a logical and intuitive manner. The exposition’s clarity sometimes

suffers, however, from the author’s obvious desire not to miss anything. Many research
avenues are just alluded to, and even fundamental notions are sometimes presented in a
sketchy manner. For instance, the topic that clearly gets the most elaborate presentation
is the IBM models, with 15 pages; yet it is unlikely that a reader new to this field will
manage to extract more than a general intuition about them.
It is also worth noting that the book probably requires more from the reader than
just “familiarity with basic concepts” of machine learning. The means and methods of
machine learning have become so ubiquitous in computational linguistics that we tend
to forget how fundamental they are: the cycle of training and testing, feature engineer-
ing, the debates of generative versus discriminative modeling, supervised versus semi-
supervised versus unsupervised learning, and so forth. All of this is part of our daily
routine and has taken over our way of viewing the field.
All this is not to say that this is not a useful book. It is a well-structured, well-written
overview of the state-of-the-art in text-translation alignment. It reads like a roadmap of
the work accomplished more than a true travel guide. As such, it is rich with pointers to
the many variations on methods and approaches to the problem. It will most likely be
of interest to the bi-curious among us: graduate students and researchers who, although
already familiar with computational linguistics, may feel attracted to the other text.
