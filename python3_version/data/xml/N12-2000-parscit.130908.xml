Welcome to the NAACL Student Research Workshop. This year, papers were submitted to two separate
tracks: Research Paper and Thesis Proposal. We received 18 submissions from ten countries and
accepted 12. Of the accepted papers, seven were research papers and five were thesis proposals. Each
accepted paper will be presented as a poster during the NAACL-HLT 2012 Poster Session and assigned
an experienced mentor who will provide constructive feedback.
The workshop received many excellent submissions this year, and we thank our Program Committee
for their thoughtful reviews. We would also like to thank the entire NAACL-HLT 2012 Organizing
Committee, especially Jennifer Chu-Carroll, Eric Fossler-Lussier, Priscilla Rasmussen, Smaranda
Muresan, and Dirk Hovy. We are also grateful to our faculty advisors, Roger Levy and Ani Nenkova, for
their guidance and involvement. Our warmest gratitude goes to the individuals who agreed to contribute
their time and expertise and serve as mentors for this workshop. Finally, we would like to acknowledge
the generous support of the U.S. National Science Foundation (Award Number IIS-1220521), which
made it possible for us to offer most of the presenters conference registration, accommodation, and
travel support.
