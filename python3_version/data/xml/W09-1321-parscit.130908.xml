This paper compares domain-oriented and
linguistically-oriented semantics, based on the
GENIA event corpus and FrameNet. While
the domain-oriented semantic structures are
direct targets of Text Mining (TM), their ex-
traction from text is not straghtforward due
to the diversity of linguistic expressions. The
extraction of linguistically-oriented semactics
is more straghtforward, and has been studied
independentely of specific domains. In or-
der to find a use of the domain-independent
research achievements for TM, we aim at
linking classes of the two types of seman-
tics. The classes were connected by analyz-
ing linguistically-oriented semantics of the ex-
pressions that mention one biological class.
With the obtained relationship between the
classes, we discuss a link between TM and
linguistically-oriented semantics.

This paper compares the linguistically-oriented and
domain-oriented semantics of the GENIA event cor-
pus, and suggests a factor for utilizing NLP tech-
niques for Text Mining (TM) in the bio-medical do-
main.
The increasing number of scientific articles in the
bio-medical domain has contributed in drawing con-
siderable attention to NLP-based TM. An impor-
tant step in NLP-based TM is obtaining the domain-
oriented semantics of sentences, as shown at the bot-
tom of figure 1. The BioInfer (Pyysalo et al., 2007)
and the GENIA event corpus (Kim et al., 2008) pro-
vide annotations of such semantic structures on col-
lections of bio-medical articles. Domain-oriented
semantic structures are valuable assets because their
representation suits information needs in the do-
main; however, the extraction of such structures is
difficult due to the large gap between the text and
these structures.
On the other hand, the extraction of linguistically-
oriented semantics from text has long been studied
in computational linguistics, and has recently been
formalized as Semantic Role Labeling (Gildea and
Jurafsky, 2002), and semantic structure extraction
(Baker et al., 2007)(Surdeanu et al., 2008). Seman-
tic structures in such tasks are exemplified in the
middle of figure 1. The linguistically-oriented se-
mantic structures are easier to extract, although the
information is not practical to the domain.
We aim at relating linguistically-oriented frames
of semantics with domain-oriented classes, thus
making a step forward in utilizing the computa-
tional linguistic resources for the bio-medical TM.
Of all the differences in the two type of seman-
tics, we focused on the fact that the former frames
are more sensitive to the perspective imposed by
the sentence writer. In the right hand-side exam-
ple of figure 1, the linguistically-oriented structure
treats PBMC, a cell entity, as an agent; however the
bio-medical structure reflects the scientific view that
there are no agents, objects acting with intention, in
bio-molecular phenomena.
As a preliminary investigation, we selected
four representative classes of bio-molecular phe-
nomena; Localization, Binding, Cell adhesion,
and Gene expression, and investigated domain-
oriented annotations for the classes in the GENIA

event corpus. Expressions mentioning the four
classes were examined and manually classified into
linguistically-oriented frames, represented by those
defined in FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998). FN frames
associated to a bio-molecular event class constitute a
list of possible perspectives in mentioning phenom-
ena of the class.
The rest of this paper is structured in the fol-
lowing way: Section 2 reviews the existing work
on semantic structures and expression varieties in
the bio-medical domain, and provides a compari-
son to our work. In section 3, we describe the GE-
NIA event corpus, and the FrameNet frames used as
linguistically-oriented classes in our investigation.
Sections 4 and 5 explain the methods and results of
the corpus investigation; in particular the sections in-
vestigate how the linguistic frames were associated
to the domain-oriented classes of semantics. Finally,
we provide discussion and conclusion in section 6
and 7.

Existing work on semantics approached domain-
oriented semantic structures from linguistically-
oriented semantics. In contrast, our approach uses
domain-oriented semantics to find the linguistic se-
mantics that represent them. We believe that the two
different approaches could complement each other.
The PASbio(Wattarujeekrit et al., 2004) pro-
poses Predicate Argument Structures (PASs), a type
of linguistically-oriented semantic structures, for
domain-specific lexical items, based on PASs de-
fined in PropBank(Wattarujeekrit et al., 2004) and
NomBank(Meyers et al., 2004). The PASs are de-
fined per lexical item, and is therefore distinct from a
biologically-oriented representation of events. (Co-
hen et al., 2008) investigated syntactic alternations
of verbs and their nominalized forms which oc-
curred in the PennBioIE corpus(Kulick et al., 2004),
whilst keeping PASs of the PASBio in their minds.
The BioFrameNet(Dolbey et al., 2006) is an at-
tempt to extend the FrameNet with specific frames
to the bio-medical domain, and to apply the frames
to corpus annotation. Our attempts were similar, in
that both were: 1) utilizing the FN frames or their
extensions to classify mentions of biological events,
and 2) relating the frames and the FEs (roles of par-
ticipants) with classes in domain ontologies; e.g. the
Gene Ontology(Ashburner et al., 2000).
As far as the authors know, it is the first at-
tempt to explicitly address the problem of linking
linguistically-oriented and domain-oriented frames
of semantics. However, it has been indirectly stud-
ied through works on TM or Relation Extraction
using linguistically-oriented semantic structures as
features, such as in the case with (Harabagiu et al.,
2005).

The GENIA event corpus consists of 1,000 Med-
line abstracts; that is, 9,372 sentences annotated
with domain-oriented semantic structures. The an-
notation was completed for all mentions of biolog-
ical events, and resulted in 6,114 identified events.
Examples of annotated event structures are shown at
the bottom of figure 1. Each structure has attributes
type and themes, which respectively show the bio-
logical class of the mentioned event and phrases ex-
pressing the event participants. The event classes are
defined based on the terms in the Gene Ontology.
For example, the Localization class in the GENIA
event corpus is defined as an equivalent of the GO
term Localization (GO0051179). The event classi-
fications used in the corpus are depicted in the left
hand-side of figure 2. Arrows in the figure depict
the inheritance relations defined in the GENIA event
ontology. For instance, the Localization class is de-
fined as a type of Physiological process. Each of
the annotated structures has additional attributes that
point phrases that the annotator of the structure used
as a clue. Among the attributes, the clueType at-
tribute shows a clue phrase to the event class. In our
investigation, the attribute was treated as a predicate,
or an equivalent of the lexical unit in the FN.
FN is a network of frames that are are
linguistically-oriented classifications of semantics.
A FN frame is defined as “a script-like conceptual
structure that describes a particular type of situation,
object, or event and the participants and proposi-
tions involved in it,” and is associated with words,
or lexical units, evoking the frame. For instance, the
verbs move, go and fly are lexical units of the Mo-
tion frame, and they share the same semantic struc-
ture. Each FN frame has annotation examples form-
ing an attestation of semantic overlap between the
lexical units. Additionally, FN defines several types
of frame-frame relations; e.g. inheritance, prece-
dence, subframe, etc. The right hand-side of figure
2 shows some FN frames and inheritance relation-
ships between them. The FN provides linguistically-
oriented classifications of event mentions based on
surface expressions, and also shows abstract rela-
tions between the frames.

The following provides the annotation proce-
dures. First, we collected linguistic expressions that
mention each of the selected GENIA event classes
from the GENIA event corpus. We then sampled
and annotated them with their linguistically-oriented
semantics which conformed to the FrameNet.

4.1 Target Classes and Keywords

<bodyText confidence="0.999991764705882">
We concentrated mainly on the mentions of four GE-
NIA classes; Localization, Binding, Cell adhesion,
and Gene expression. Gene expression, Binding,
and Localization are three of the most frequent four
classes in the GENIA event corpus.&apos; Binding and
Localization are the two most primitive molecular
events. The Cell adhesion class was included as a
comparison for the Binding class.
Counting keywords for mentioning events was
close to automatic. We extracted phrases pointed
by a clueType attribute from each event structure.
We then tokenized the phrases, performed a simple
stemming on the tokens, and counted the resulting
words. The stemming process simply replaced each
inflected word to its stem by consulting a small list
of inflected words with their stems. Manual work
was only used in making the small list.

A major challenge encountered in annotating a sam-

ing to FN, was in the assignment of a FN frame to

the mention. Our decision was based on the follow-
ing four points: 1) keywords used in the mention, 2)
description of FN frames, 3) syntactic positions of
the event participants, and 4) frame-frame relations.
The first indicates that a FN frame became a can-
didate frame for the mention, if the keyword in the
mention is a lexical unit of the FN frame. FN frames
and their lexical units could be easily checked by
consulting the FN dictionary. If there were no en-
tries for the keyword in the dictionary, synonyms or
words in the keyword’s definition were used. For ex-
ample, the verb translocate has no entries in the FN
dictionary, and the frames for verbs such as move
were used instead.
For the second point, we discarded FN frames that
are either evoked by a completely different sense of
the keyword, or too specific of a non-biological sit-
uations.
Before we assigned a FN frame to each mention,
we manually examined the syntactic positions of all
event participants present in the sampled GENIA
mentions. Combinations of the syntactic position
and event participants observed for a keyword were
compared with sample annotations of the candidate
FN frames.
We checked frame-frame relations between the
candidate frames, because they can be regarded
as evidence that shows that the conception of the
frames is related. For our aim, it was sufficient to
choose a set of frames that best describes the differ-
ent perspectives for mentioning one type of molecu-
lar phenomena. Even when some keywords seemed
to be dissimilar in the three points mentioned above,

5 Analysis

<bodyText confidence="0.999652166666667">
After the linguistic annotation was performed, we
compared the GENIA event structure and the frame
structure of each sampled expression, and obtained
relations of the GENIA class-FN frame and GE-
NIA slot-FN participant. The resulting relationships
between FN frames and the four GENIA classes
demonstrate a gap between linguistically-oriented
and domain-oriented classification of events, as
shown in figure 2.
The relations can be explained by decomposing it
into two cases: 1) 1-to-n mappings, and 2) n-to-1
mappings. The n-to-n mapping from GENIA to FN
can then be regarded as a mix of the two cases. In
the following sections, the two cases are described
in detail. Further, we show conversion examples of
a FN structure to a GENIA event structure, which
were supported by the obtained GENIA participant-
FN participant relations.

The Binding class in GENIA is defined as
“the selective, often stoichiometric interaction of a
molecule with one or more specific sites on an-
other molecule.” We associated the class with three
frames, and two frames of the three, Attaching and
Becoming frames, represent different perspectives
for mentioning the class. The Being attached frame
shares the same conception as Attaching, but ex-
presses states instead of events. See table 1 for key-
words of the class, and the frames assigned to the
words.
Attaching: In the perspective represented by this
frame, a binding phenomenon was recognized as a
event in which protein molecules were simply at-
tached to one another.

The Localization class in the GENIA corpus is de-
fined as a class for “any process by which a cell, a
substance, or a cellular entity, such as a protein com-
plex or organelle, is transported to, and/or main-
tained in a specific location.” Sampled expressions
of the class separated into mentions of a process, by
which an entity was transported to a specific loca-
tion, and those of the process in which an entity was
maintained in a specific location. We concentrate on
the former in this section, and describe the latter in
section 5.1.3.
We associated the frames: Motion, Releasing and
Getting with what we call translocation events, or
Localization events in which an entity was trans-
ported to a specific location. Figure 3 provides a

Each of the three frames had a different perspective

domain-oriented semantics of the bio-molecular
ticles. Our preliminary result illustrates the gap be-Cl
tween the two type of semantics, and a relationship
between them. We discuss development of a Text
Mining (TM) system, in association with the extrac-
tion of linguistically-oriented semantics, which has
been studied independently of TM.
First, our result would show that TM involves at
least two qualitatively different tasks. One task is
related to our results; that is, recognizing equiva-
lent events which are expressed from different per-
spectives, and hence expressed by using different
linguistic frames, and at the same time distinguish-
ing event mentions which share the same linguistic
frame but belong to different domain classes. Our
investigation indicates that this task is mainly depen-
dent on domain knowledge and how a phenomenon
can be conceptualized. Another task of TM is the ex-
traction of linguistically-oriented semantics, which
basically maps various syntactic realizations to the
shared structures. In order to develop a TM system,
we need to solve the two difficult tasks.
Second, TM could benefit from linguistically-
oriented frames by using them as an intermediat-
ing layer between text and domain-oriented infor-
mation. The domain-oriented semantic structures,
which is a target of TM, are inevitably dependent
on the domain. On the other hand, the extraction of
linguistically-oriented semantics from text is less de-
pendent. Therefore, using the linguistically-oriented
structure could be favorable to domain portability of
a TM system.
Our aim was explicitly linking linguistically-
oriented and domain-oriented semantics of the bio-
molecular articles, and the preliminary result show
the possibility of the extraction of linguistically-
oriented semantics contributing to TM. Further in-
vestigation of the relationship would be a important

Our investigation was preliminary. For exam-
ple, conversions from FN structures to GENIA event
structures, depicted in figures 4 and 5, were based
on manual investigation. Further, they were attested
by limited samples in the corpus. For our results to
contribute to a TM system, evaluation of the conver-
sions and automatic extraction of such conversions
must be considered.

This paper presents a relationship of domain-
oriented and linguistically-oriented frames of se-
mantics, obtained by an investigation of the GE-
NIA event corpus. In the investigation, we anno-
tated sample sentences from the GENIA event cor-
pus with linguistically-oriented semantic structures
as those of FrameNet, and compared them with
domain-oriented semantic annotations that the cor-
pus originally possesses. The resulting relations
between the domain-oriented and linguistically-
oriented frames suggest that mentions of a bio-
logical phenomenon could be realized in a num-
ber of linguistically-oriented frames, and that
the linguistically-oriented frames represent possible
perspectives in mentioning the phenomenon. The
resulting relations would illustrate a challenge in
developing a Text Mining system, and would indi-
cate importance of linguistically-oriented frames as
an intermediating layer between text and domain-
oriented information. Our future plan includes
evaluation of our conversions from a linguistically-
oriented to a domain-oriented structure, and auto-
matic extraction of such conversions.

<abstract confidence="0.9977856">This paper compares domain-oriented and linguistically-oriented semantics, based on the GENIA event corpus and FrameNet. While the domain-oriented semantic structures are direct targets of Text Mining (TM), their extraction from text is not straghtforward due to the diversity of linguistic expressions. The extraction of linguistically-oriented semactics is more straghtforward, and has been studied independentely of specific domains. In order to find a use of the domain-independent research achievements for TM, we aim at linking classes of the two types of semantics. The classes were connected by analyzing linguistically-oriented semantics of the expressions that mention one biological class. With the obtained relationship between the classes, we discuss a link between TM and linguistically-oriented semantics.</abstract>

The increasing number of scientific articles in the bio-medical domain has contributed in drawing considerable attention to NLP-based TM. An important step in NLP-based TM is obtaining the domainoriented semantics of sentences, as shown at the bottom of figure 1.

Domain-oriented semantic structures are valuable assets because their representation suits information needs in the domain; however, the extraction of such structures is difficult due to the large gap between the text and these structures.

The increasing number of scientific articles in the bio-medical domain has contributed in drawing considerable attention to NLP-based TM. An important step in NLP-based TM is obtaining the domainoriented semantics of sentences, as shown at the bottom of figure 1. The BioInfer (Pyysalo et al., 2007) and the GENIA event corpus (Kim et al., 2008) provide annotations of such semantic structures on collections of bio-medical articles. Domain-oriented semantic structures are valuable assets because their representation suits information needs in the domain; however, the extraction of such structures is difficult due to the large gap between the text and these structures.
