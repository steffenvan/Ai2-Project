Welcome to the NAACL HLT 2013 Student Research Workshop.
This year, we have two different kinds of paper: research papers and thesis proposals. Thesis proposals
are intended for advanced students who have decided on a thesis topic and wish to get feedback on their
proposal and broader ideas for their continuing work, while research papers can describe completed
work or work in progress with preliminary results.
All the papers will be presented in the main conference poster session, giving the opportunity for
students to interact and present their work to a large and diverse audience. In addition, we have
a separate session for the student papers on the first day of workshops (after the main conference).
During this session, students will present their papers and receive feedback from mentors. The mentors
are experienced researchers who will prepare in-depth comments and questions in advance of the
presentation. Each accepted paper is assigned a mentor. The separate session is newly introduced
this year and differs from recent NAACL student workshops where student talks were during the main
conference sessions or the papers were presented as posters only. We expect that the focused workshop
will provide a greater opportunity for receive feedback from mentors, and also allow the students to
network and socialize with other student participants.
We received 8 thesis proposals and 15 research papers. Out of these we accepted 6 thesis proposals
and 7 research papers leading to an acceptance rate of 75% for thesis proposals and 47% for research
papers. We thank our dedicated program committee who gave constructive and detailed reviews for
the student papers. We also thank the NAACL 2013 organizing committee—Lucy Vanderwende, Hal
Daumé III, Katrin Kirchhoff, Priscilla Rassmussen, Matt Post and Colin Cherry.
