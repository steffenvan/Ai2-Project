In my comments,I will try to summarize
briefly the six papers in this session,
pointing out some key aspects of each
contribution, listing some common themes,and
raising some questions, not for the purpose of
criticizing one or another contribution, but
rather for the purpose of prodding the authors
to discuss these questions in their
presentations.

[GINI:A robust IL data base interface has
been described. The system consists of two
parts:a natural language processor for
building a formal representation and an
application program for building a query in an
augmented relational algebra. Portability is
achieved by providing (i) definitions of new
concepts for the NL processor and (ii) the
connection between the relations in the data
base and NL 7rocessor concepts.
[GHF]:A robust portable NL interface is
described, the portability evaluted with
respect to two application domains. The
initial processing is based on the Linguistic
String Parser. The domain dependent
information is characterized by domain
information schema which specify the
correspondences between information structures
in the texts and the various internal
representations. Modularity of design is
emphasized for achieving portability and
managing complexity.
[GRO]:The major theme is the construction
of transportable NL interfaces. A unique
feature of the TEAM system is the interactive
facilty for acquiring information for adapting
NL interfaces to data bases for which they
were not handtailored. The DIALOGIC system
constructs a logical form for the query and
the data base access system translates the
logical form into a data base query.
Transportability is achieved by factoring the
domain dependent and domain independent
information. Some acquisitional and control
strategies are also discussed.
[TBI: This is a retrospective view of
the EUFID system,tracing its develpoment from
the initial design specifications, including
various stages of intermediate implementations
and experience with different applications,
and finally,ending with a list of problems to
be solved. TB conclude that robust 11. systems
do not exist and provide some guidelines for
the design of such systems.
[TTI:The NL interface(ASK) is meant for a
user who wants to create, test change,
augment, and, of course, use her/his knowledge
base. The user interface is a limited subset
of English. Fast response time is a major
goal. Transportability is achieved via a
dialogue in ASK which drives the Bulk Data
Input Capability. Dialogues in ASK can also
he used to design dialogues. A unique feature
of the system is that it has been already
implemented on a desktp computer,HP 9846.
(GT1:An NL interface, IR-NLI, is
described, which is meant for non-
professional users for accessing on-line data
bases. The basic components of the system are
described in general terms. An illustrative
example is presented in which , in addition to
the user-system dialogue, the internal
representations and the search strategies are
reported in the Euronet DIANE EUROLANGUAGE.
Several future directions are
suggested,including the system taking more
initiative and providing justification of its
mode of operation.
II. SOME QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION
L. All authors have dealt with the issue
of domain independence, an important aspect of
portability and robustness. The main strategy
for achieving this behaviour is to factor the
system into two parts, one based on domain
independent knowledge and the other on the
domain dependent knowledge. At least two
systems[GRO and TTI talk about interactively
acquiring the information needed for
adaptation. GRO and TT should discuss the
similarities and differences in their
approaches to acquisition.
2. GIN uses the preference information
in the data base connection part of his system
to induce coercions(e.g., &apos;a doctor within 200
miles&amp;quot; meaning &apos;a ship with a doctor on it
within 200 miles). CEO in TEAM achieves the
iame effect by inference rules. It is not
clear just what the difference is between
CEO&apos;s approach and GIN&apos;s approach, i.e.,
between inducing coercions and making the
inferences. GRO nad GIN should discuss the
realtive merits of their approaches.
3. The domain information schema of GHF
specify the correspondence between information
structures as they appear in the text and the
various internal representations of
information in the system. The system
described by CHF is the only one in this
session which derives its domain dependent
knowledge from the texts instead of domain
experts. GHJ should discuss how successful
they are with this approach. Also perhaps
they should discuss how their representations
compare with those in TEAM[GROI.
4. TB have reviewed the history of EUFID
and ended up on a negative note. They feel
robust systems do not really exist yet. Since
all the other authors have described &apos;robust&apos;
systems, perhaps TB should discuss their
conclusions in some derail and comment on th4.
claims of these authors.
5. TT have empahsized the speed of
response as a major feature of their system.
What are the trade-offs between speed and the
modularity of the design ? TT should comment
on this aspect as well as other related
aspects due to their concern for bringing up
the system on a desktop computer.
6. Most of the issues discussed by GT in
the first four sections of their paper pertain
to making formal query language(FL)interfaces
also portable. In fact, many of the issues
about portability that the other authors have
addressed to are also related to FL
interfaces. It would be very useful if
some(or all) of the authors discuss some
specific problems about portability that are
special to NL interfaces in contrast to FL
interfaces.
Does the need for having flexible and
lortable interfaces for data bases necessarily
force us towards NL interfaces ? We hope so !
Perhaps, some of the authors will comment on
this issue. Their specific experience with
their own systems would be very relevant here.
7. A question that is worth discussing by
all the authors is whether portability and
robustness can be helped if the design of the
data base itself is determined by the
consideration that an NL interface will be
huoked to it ?
