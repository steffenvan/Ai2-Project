Dig Where Language Is Greenest!
For a generation, the best minds have been squeezing the juice out of•
syntax and other structure. Yet communication also involves meaning
and procedure, aspects that remain unexploited.
Now, a Periodic table of processes&apos;Im has been devised! It is The Wordtree ®. - Henry
G. Burger&apos;s nomenclator describes, like stroboscope phases, every transitive verb in the
language as the sum of its previous action and the addition: To RELEGATE and DELAY 4
= DEFER. To DEFER and INTERRUPT = ADJOURN, etc. All parts are cross-referenced.
You can use Dr. Burger&apos;s add-on dictionary to branch backward to pinpoint causes,
and forward to pinpoint effects. You hook into the largest existing expert system: culture
itself. The system changes vocabulary from passive description to active maneuvering.
Reviewers say: &amp;quot;Entirely new, impressively comprehensive, The Wordtree ® deserves
close study, long trial, and perhaps incorporation into the mainstream.&amp;quot; - Lexicographica.
// &amp;quot;An exceptionally important and original publication not merely for English but lin-
guistics and science as well.&amp;quot; - Neoterm.

Neural Computation will provide a unique interdisciplinary forum for the dissemination of important re-
search results and for reviews of research areas in neural computation.
Neural computation is a rapidly growing field that is attracting researchers in neuroscience, psychology,
physics, mathematics, electrical engineering, computer science, and artificial intelligence. Researchers
within these disciplines address, from special perspectives, the twin scientific and engineering challenges
of understanding the brain and building computers. The journal serves to bring together work from various
application areas, highlighting common problems and techniques in modeling the brain and in the design
and construction of neurally-inspired information processing systems.
By publishing timely short communications and research reviews, Neural Computation will allow re-
searchers easy access to information on important advances and will provide a valuable overview of the
broad range of work contributing to neural computation. The journal will not accept long research articles.
The fields covered include neuroscience, computer science, artificial intelligence, mathematics, physics,
psychology, linguistics, adaptive systems, vision, speech, robotics, optical computing, and VLSI.
Neural Computation is published quarterly by The MIT Press.

<bodyText confidence="0.999707">
Membership in the Association for Computational Linguistics is for the calendar year, it includes the ACL journal Computational
Linguistics, reduced registration at most ACL-sponsored conferences, and discounts on ACL-sponsored publications. Institutional
memberships were discontinued in 1988 when MIT Press began publishing the journal; instead, institutions should subscribe to the
journal through MIT Press Journals, 55 Hayward Street, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; 617:253-2889. Back issues and proceedings
are available only from the ACL Office, except that institutions should backorder journals from 1988 on through MIT Press. An order
form is on the other side of this statement. The change in publishing required establishing a late payment for renewals made after 15
March, because of the extra mailing and handling costs. The late payment fee does not apply to new members. Dues and back order
payments can be made in Europe and Japan as well as the U.S.; read the directions under the heading PAYMENT below carefully.
Identify your institutional affiliation if it is not part of your address. Also please provide your telephone number and computer
network address.

Guidelines for Submissions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.932646333333333">
Manuscripts to Computational Linguistics should be submitted on letter-size paper (8.5 by 11 inches,
or A4), double-spaced throughout, including footnotes and references. The paper should begin with
an informative abstract of approximately 150-250 words. Manuscripts must be written in English.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.95458">
Submissions may be made in any of the following categories:
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.91972880952381">
PAPER: This category includes contributions that report significant new research results in
computational linguistics or that provide critical reviews of the literature on a particular topic. The
length of a paper depends on its content, but we suggest that manuscripts be limited to forty
double-spaced pages. That is the equivalent of twelve journal pages. Each paper is fully refereed,
being read by at least two members of the editorial board and usually by an additional expert in the
particular subject area.
The submission of an article to CL for refereeing means that the author certifies the manuscript
is not copyrighted; nor has it been published or submitted for publication to another refereed
journal. If any version of the paper has appeared, or will appear, in a non-refereed publication, the
details of such publication must be made known to the Editor at the time of submission. The final
version of a paper tentatively accepted for publication must be accompanied by a Copyright
Transfer Agreement signed by all of the authors or, in the case of a &amp;quot;work for hire,&amp;quot; by the
employer. This written transfer is necessary under the 1978 U.S. Copyright law.
TECHNICAL CORRESPONDENCE: This category includes short articles reporting preliminary
results of some project in progress, or the results of other studies of interest to the readership.
Technical correspondences should not generally exceed eight double-spaced pages. Each technical
correspondence is reviewed by at least two members of the editorial board before acceptance.
LETTERS TO THE EDITOR: This includes statements of opinion on issues relevant to the
readership. The Editor and the editorial board will evaluate the appropriateness of these contribu-
tions for inclusion.
Five copies of papers, technical correspondences, and letters should be sent to the Editor:

Submissions may be made in any of the following categories: category includes contributions that report significant new research results in computational linguistics or that provide critical reviews of the literature on a particular topic. The length of a paper depends on its content, but we suggest that manuscripts be limited to forty double-spaced pages. That is the equivalent of twelve journal pages. Each paper is fully refereed, being read by at least two members of the editorial board and usually by an additional expert in the particular subject area. The submission of an article to CL for refereeing means that the author certifies the manuscript is not copyrighted; nor has it been published or submitted for publication to another refereed journal. If any version of the paper has appeared, or will appear, in a non-refereed publication, the details of such publication must be made known to the Editor at the time of submission. The final version of a paper tentatively accepted for publication must be accompanied by a Copyright Transfer Agreement signed by all of the authors or, in the case of a &amp;quot;work for hire,&amp;quot; by the employer. This written transfer is necessary under the 1978 U.S. Copyright law. CORRESPONDENCE: category includes short articles reporting preliminary results of some project in progress, or the results of other studies of interest to the readership. Technical correspondences should not generally exceed eight double-spaced pages. Each technical correspondence is reviewed by at least two members of the editorial board before acceptance. TO THE EDITOR: includes statements of opinion on issues relevant to the readership. The Editor and the editorial board will evaluate the appropriateness of these contributions for inclusion.</abstract>
