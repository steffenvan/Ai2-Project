I was a little startled to find Victor Yngve (1998) using my review of his book From
Grammar to Science as a peg on which to hang a sustained critique of my article &amp;quot;Depth
in English grammar&amp;quot; (Sampson 1997), an item that was mentioned only tangentially
in the book review.
My 1997 article tested Yngve&apos;s famous depth hypothesis of forty years ago against
data of a kind richer than was available then. It showed that the hypothesis as formu-
lated by Yngve was not precisely the correct generalization about English, but it also
showed that there does exist an invariant quantitative property of English syntactic
structures that is closely related to Yngve&apos;s hypothesis.
Yngve regards this demonstration as empty, on the grounds that there are different
schemes for representing English grammatical structure, and hence my finding could
have been merely the result of an arbitrary choice of analyses. &amp;quot;The fact that [Sampson]
could not have anticipated the result he found does not validate the work as empirical
scientific research; any nonsensical result would be equally unanticipated&amp;quot; (Yngve
1998, p. 635).
Of course there are alternative schemes of grammatical analysis. My article drew
attention to this, and surmised that the finding might be robust with respect to choice
of analytic scheme. (This surmise could prove mistaken, but Yngve does nothing to
suggest that it was in fact mistaken.) The point that seems to be lost on Yngve, though,
is that there was no a priori reason to expect the data to yield any result as specific and
precise as the result that emerged. It was a surprise to me to find, long after publication
of the SUSANNE Corpus, that its structures displayed a quantitative property whose
distribution possesses so low a standard deviation round its mean as does the property
of &amp;quot;raw production-based sentence depth&amp;quot; defined in Sampson (1997).
Yngve seems to imagine that the team responsible for the SUSANNE Corpus
brought about this outcome by making arbitrary analytic decisions. Protestations about
our research ethics would be redundant here; we would not have known how to cook
the books that way even if we wanted to. No member of the team that produced
the SUSANNE Corpus was aware of the measure that later turned out to be highly
invariant. (The team had scattered by the time I engaged in the research reported in
Sampson [1997], so most members are very likely unaware of it even now.) If we had
been conscious of it, I cannot imagine how we could have gone about forcing our
analyses to conform to the quantitative invariant, while achieving consistency with
published analytic guidelines defined in great detail and in entirely nonquantitative
terms. All that effort, just to manufacture a basis for one 20-page journal article? I don&apos;t
think so. The invariant was there in the language samples; we didn&apos;t put it there.

does not rest upon solid bedrock&amp;quot; (Popper 1959, p. 111). Rather, in Popper&apos;s figure,
scientific theories are structures erected on piles driven into a swamp. If any particular
support seems unsatisfactory, it can be driven deeper; but there is no ultimate bottom
to be reached anywhere.
