Recent studies in both artificial intelligence and linguistics have demonstrated the need
for a theory of the comprehension of anaphoric expressions, a theory that accounts for the
role of syntactic and semantic effects, as well as inferential knowledge in explaining how
anaphors are understood. In this paper a new approach, based on a theory of the process
of focusing on parts of the discourse, is used to explain the interpretation of anaphors.
The concept of a speaker&apos;s foci is defined, and their use is demonstrated in choosing the
interpretations of personal pronouns. The rules for choosing interpretations are stated
within a framework that shows: how to control search in inferring by a new method called
constraint checking; how to take advantage of syntactic, semantic and discourse constraints
on interpretation; and how to generalize the treatment of personal pronouns, to serve as a
framework for the theory of interpretation for all anaphors.

Traditionally researchers have defined the problem
of comprehending anaphoric expressions as one of
determining the antecedent of an anaphoric expression,
that is, determining to which word or phrase an ana-
phoric expression refers or &amp;quot;points&amp;quot;. Recent studies
in both artificial intelligence and linguistics have dem-
onstrated the need for a theory of the comprehension
of anaphoric expressions, a theory that accounts for
the role of syntactic and semantic effects, as well as
inferential knowledge in explaining how anaphors are
understood. In this paper a new theory, based on the
concept of focusing in the discourse, is introduced to
explain the interpretation of pronouns.
Before a theory can be given, and before even the
difficulties in interpreting anaphors2 can be discussed,

2 I use the term &amp;quot;anaphor&amp;quot; for an anaphoric expression, and I
use &amp;quot;anaphora&amp;quot; in its traditional meaning, that is, as the device of
using a word or phrase &amp;quot;to point back.&amp;quot;

we must first re-consider what an antecedent is. The
traditional definition encounters difficulty right from
the start; it is founded on the notion that one word in
a sentence refers or points back to another word or
phrase in the (same or another) sentence. But words
don&apos;t refer back to other words [Morgan 1978]; people
use words to refer to entities in the world. In particu-
lar they use pronouns to refer to entities which have
already been mentioned in a discourse. Since an ana-
phoric phrase does not refer to an antecedent, one
might want to claim that both the antecedent and the
anaphor co-refer to the same entity. That description
is adequate for sentence s 1,
s 1 I think green apples taste best and they
make the best cooking apples too.
though not for discourse D1, where there is no ante-
cedent phrase in the discourse that co-refers with the
pronoun &amp;quot;they.&amp;quot;

2 They are really huge but gas-efficient
bikes.
Rather than view antecedence as co-reference, one
might propose that antecedence is a kind of cognitive
pointing, the kind of pointing that causes &amp;quot;they&amp;quot; and
&amp;quot;green apples&amp;quot; to point (somehow) to the same class
of entities in one&apos;s mind. This proposal is problematic
for the same reason that co-reference is: people use
pronouns when there is no other noun phrase in the

discourse that points to the right mental entity. In D1,
&amp;quot;they&amp;quot; refers to bikes which are Harley 1200&apos;s as a
group, while &amp;quot;a monster Harley 1200&amp;quot; mentions only
some particular Harley 1200. &amp;quot;They&amp;quot; seems to be
able to refer when used with the previously mentioned
phrase &amp;quot;a monster Harley 1200&amp;quot; without the two
phrases either co-referring or co-pointing.
If an anaphor does not refer to an antecedent
phrase, and if it need not always co-refer with its ap-
parent antecedent (as in D1), then anaphor interpreta-
tion is not simply finding the antecedent. Nevertheless
the concept of antecedence as pointing back does
seem to capture some aspect of the comprehension of
anaphors, for when certain antecedent words are miss-
ing from a discourse, people often fail to understand
what is being said.
Let us define the problem of interpreting and un-
derstanding an anaphor in the following way. The
phrase &amp;quot;green apples&amp;quot; in s 1 , when syntactically and
semantically interpreted, is said to specify a cognitive
element in the hearer&apos;s mind. In the computational
model of that process, this element is a database item,
which might be represented by Apples2 in by the sche-
ma below:
Phrase76:
string: &amp;quot;green apples&amp;quot;
context: speaker 1 think * tastes best
specifies: Apples2
Apples2:
super-concept: apples
color: green
used-for: cooking
The speaker uses the information in a cognitive repre-
sentation like Apples2 above to choose the phrase
&amp;quot;green apples&amp;quot; in s 1 . The hearer then uses the phrase
&amp;quot;green apples&amp;quot; plus the syntactic and semantic inter-
pretation of the rest of the sentence to locate a similar
cognitive element in his own mind; it may be slightly
different because the hearer may not associate use in
cooking with green apples. A cognitive element, such
as Apples2, is called the specification of &amp;quot;green ap-
ples.&amp;quot; These elements, present in the memories of
speaker and hearer, are of course related to other cog-
nitive elements in their memories.
What is the relation of specifications to the real
world? One might like to claim that a reference rela-
tion exists between specified cognitive elements and
objects in the world, but since referring is what people
do with words, this relation is problematic for cogni-
tive elements. Instead, specifications are said to
represent the objects referred to; that is, they bear a
well-structured correspondence to objects in the world.
Apples2, the specification of &amp;quot;green apples,&amp;quot; repre-
sents the objects that are green apples. For phrases
such as &amp;quot;Santa Claus,&amp;quot; where there is no real world
object to represent, a specification represents the men-
tal schema to which are attached the properties nor-
mally associated with this imaginary person.
The phrase &amp;quot;they&amp;quot; in s 1 also specifies a cognitive
element, namely the same one that &amp;quot;green apples&amp;quot;
does. Since the two bear the same relation to the
representation Apples2, I say that they &amp;quot;co-specify&amp;quot;
that memory element, or alternatively, that the inter-
pretation of &amp;quot;green apples&amp;quot; is the co-specifier of the
interpretation of &amp;quot;they.&amp;quot; Co-specification, unlike
co-reference, allows one to construct abstract repre-
sentations and define relationships between them
which can be studied in a computational framework.
With co-reference no such use is possible, since the
object referred to exists in the world and is not availa-
ble for examination by computational processes.
Even if a phrase and a pronoun do not co-specify,
the specification of the phrase may be used to generate
the specification of a pronoun. For example, in DI.
&amp;quot;they&amp;quot; does not co-specify with the apparent anteced-
ent phrase &amp;quot;a monster Harley 1200,&amp;quot; but rather it
refers to the class of Harley 1200&apos;s of which the ap-
parent antecedent is an instance. Thus anaphor inter-
pretation is not simply a matter of finding the corre-
sponding cognitive element that serves as the specifi-
cation of the anaphor; some additional process must
generate a specification for the anaphor from the rela-
ted phrase &amp;quot;a monster Harley 1200.&amp;quot;
The concepts of specification and co-specification
capture the &amp;quot;pointing back&amp;quot; quality of antecedence,
and also permit us to formulate an explanation of ana-
phor interpretation that avoids the pitfalls of the con-
cept of antecedence. Anaphor interpretation can be
studied as a computational process that uses the al-
ready existing specification of a phrase to find the
specification for an anaphor. The process uses a rep-
resentation of the discourse preceding the anaphor to
encode the syntactic and semantic relationships in each
sentence as well as co-specification relationships be-
tween phrases.3 These definitions in themselves do
not constitute a theory of anaphor interpretation.
They do, however, make possible a succinct statement
of the problem: how does one determine the specifi-
cation of a anaphor? Also, since we suspect that the
specification of an apparent antecedent phrase plays
some role in choosing an anaphor&apos;s specification, we
may ask, just what is this role? We hope for a direct
answer to these questions, but before one can be giv-
en, let us consider how a theory of interpretation
ought to address these questions. A brief look at the

computes semantic relations among words of the sentence.

difficulties of choosing co-specifiers suggests which
issues our theory should cover.
Determining the co-specifier of an anaphor is diffi-
cult because there are a multitude of possible co-
specifiers in a given discourse, and there is no simple
way to choose the correct one. Yet human hearers
and readers generally do recover the correct co-
specifying phrase intended by the speaker. Human
readers and hearers also fail to recover the co-
specifying phrase in certain situations; this behavior is
just as valuable an observation as garden path phe-
nomena for theories of parsing. A theory of interpre-
tation must predict the pattern of the hearer&apos;s and
reader&apos;s correct and incorrect choices, as well as fail-
ures to understand, by a rule-governed account. In
addition, a taxonomy of the cases in which specifica-
tions are used to generate other specifications must be
given, as well as a means of predicting their distribu-
tion.
Two other aspects of communication make it diffi-
cult to find co-specifiers: the context of discussion and
the inferences people make. People use the context
surrounding an anaphor in understanding it. If a theo-
ry of anaphor interpretation is to capture understand-
ing, it must include a means of encoding discourse
context and whatever structure it has; the context
must be distilled into a form that preserves its richness
without adding overwhelming complexity to the inter-
pretation process. In addition, researchers have dis-
covered that anaphor interpretation involves making
inferences, some of which can be complex, each of
which must be chosen from a large base of knowledge
about objects, people and things. The practical de-
ployment of inferential capabilities for any task re-
quires control: knowing what to infer when, and
knowing when to stop. Since the general control
problem is poorly understood, a theory of anaphor
interpretation must provide solutions to the more spe-
cific problem of controlling inference in anaphor inter-
pretation.
The major portion of this paper addresses the is-
sues of determining the specifications of anaphors,
with an emphasis on the role of context and inference.
The theory of focusing on parts of the discourse is
introduced, and a processor and its rules which rely on
the focusing theory are discussed. Before turning to
this discussion, the previous and extensive research on
anaphora are reviewed.

2. Research on Anaphora
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9940724">
The role of context and inference, as well as syntax
and semantics, on anaphor interpretation have been
explored extensively. A brief look at these explora-
tions indicates the necessity of a new approach. Re-
search on anaphora falls into four broad categories:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9982444">
1. General heuristics for finding antecedents
[Winograd 19721
2. Syntactic and semantic constraints on anaphora
[Katz &amp; Fodor 1963, Woods et al. 1976, Chomsky
1976, Lasnik 1976, Reinhart 1976, Walker 1976]
3. Use of inference to find antecedents [Charniak
1972, Rieger 1974, Hobbs 1976]
4. Analysis of relations among objects in a discourse
context [Grosz 1977, Lockman 1978, Reichman
1978, Webber 1978, Hobbs 1979]
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.987646030927835">
Rather than review each approach, I point out the
contributions of each type to a theory of pronoun
interpretation.
General heuristics, as a means of choosing anteced-
ents, predict reliably in a large number of typical ex-
amples. However, no simple characterization fits the
wide variety of cases where they fail (see Winograd
1972 and Hobbs 1977); furthermore, the heuristic
approach is not theoretically grounded and cannot
offer a unified approach to the phenomena.
Semantic selectional restrictions, based on the Katz-
Fodor theory of semantic markers, and used by many
computational linguists, can reduce the space of possi-
ble antecedents, but they cannot be used to eliminate
all possibilities, as the example below illustrates
(where feeling soft can be said of either a mud pack or
one&apos;s face):
s2 Put the mud pack on your face. Notice
how soft it feels.
Syntactic restrictions, on logical form [Chomsky 1976]
and on constituent structure [Lasnik 1976, Reinhart
1976], stipulate conditions in which a pronoun and a
noun phrase must have disjoint reference, as shown
below.
s3 * Near Dan, he saw a snake.
s4 * The man whose house he bought went
gold digging in Alaska.
These rules, however, do not stipulate the interpreta-
tion of a pronoun; in a general theory they serve only
as a filtering condition on the class of possible co-
specifications. Furthermore, syntactic restrictions
must also stipulate the disjoint reference conditions on
reflexive pronouns although no adequate account of
these conditions has yet appeared.
Work by researchers in artificial intelligence on
inference led to methods for forward and backward
chaining of inferences to bind the pronoun, represent-
ed as a free variable, with some piece of knowledge;
with this approach, the pronoun&apos;s interpretation was
the value bound to the free variable. This approach
revealed that inferences about world knowledge are
often needed to interpret pronouns. However, these
methods failed to control the inference process suffi-
ciently. Charniak, attempting to resolve this problem,
American Journal of Computational Linguistics, Volume 7, Number 4, October-December 1981 219
Candace L. Sidner Focusing for Interpretation of Pronouns
proposed demons that would &amp;quot;wake up&amp;quot; in the appro-
priate situation (that is, processes which could them-
selves notice when they were to begin processing).
But a large cache of demons would be required, and
no assurance could be given that demons would exist
in every situation. Most significantly, this proposal
said nothing about the situation where two or more
demons might apply (who gets control? how are the
decisions made?). Furthermore all of the inference-
based approaches to pronoun interpretation fail to
offer any theoretical approach because they rely on a
simple mechanism, (simple variable binding between
pronoun and some other phrase) which does not apply
in many uses of anaphors, such as Dl.
Discourse approaches to anaphora include a techni-
que similar to the inference method; one identifies
sentence pairs and determines their semantic relation-
ship as one of elaboration, similarity, contrast, parallel
structure; the pronouns are interpreted by variable
binding between items of the sentence pairs [Hobbs
1979]. Webber 1978, using a notion of &amp;quot;discourse
identifications&amp;quot; (that contain certain semantic and
discourse content) similar to the notion of specifica-
tion, stipulates constraints on the representation of
relations among items mentioned in a discourse.
Grosz [1977, 1978, 1981] illustrates how parts of a
speaker&apos;s knowledge, relevant to a discourse segment,
are highlighted via focusing, a process that reflects
what a speaker says and the nature of the knowledge
in the space. She shows that the structure of a task
affects what items will be focused on in the discourse.
Reichman has expanded this paradigm by describing
context spaces, delineated by their topics. Her analysis
shows that within a context space only certain items
may be pronominalized. She leaves open the ques-
tions: What is the recognition procedure for determin-
ing a context space? How does one identify its topic?
How does the hearer determine the interpretation of a
pronoun, i.e., how does a hearer decide which highly
focused items act as the co-specification of a pronoun?
All these approaches support the view that since hear-
ers do not have privileged access to a speaker&apos;s mind,
other than through what a speaker says, imposing
structure on the speaker&apos;s discourse will provide a
framework for establishing the interpretation of pro-
nouns.
The remainder of this paper defines the concept of
speaker&apos;s foci and shows that they can be used to
choose specifications for personal pronouns. The rules
for choosing interpretations are stated within a frame-
work that shows:

3. Focus for Pronoun Interpretation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99937725">
A simple discourse can be used to illustrate how
pronouns indicate what the speaker is talking about in
the discourse. In the sample below, the speaker men-
tions two dogs and tells us something about each.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.800115090909091">
D2-1 I have two dogs.
2 (The) one is a poodle;
3 the other is a cocker spaniel.
4 The poodle has some weird habits.
5 He eats plastic flowers and likes to sleep
in a paper bag.
6 It&apos;s a real problem keeping him away from
plastic flowers.

8 and he&apos;s a good watch dog.
9 I like having them as pets.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999919258064516">
The speaker uses the pronouns &amp;quot;he&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;him&amp;quot; to
indicate that the poodle is the actor of eating flowers
and the object of an action of keeping. The speaker
mentions his second dog with &amp;quot;the other&amp;quot; and then
uses the pronoun &amp;quot;he&amp;quot; only in predicate adjective and
predicate nominative constructions without reference
to any events. Initially the speaker focuses attention
on both dogs and then turns his attention to each for a
part of the discourse. The process by which the
speaker uses language to indicate his focus is called
the focusing process. The items in focus are those that
are talked about for a part of the discourse. Items in
focus can be used in two ways, as actor focus and as
discourse focus. The actor focus is a discourse item
that is predicated as the agent in some event, so for
example, the poodle is the agent in eating flowers,
while the discourse focus is, roughly speaking, an item
the speaker wishes to make several predications
about.4
The focusing process, when explained from the
viewpoint of a hearer, can be described as a process of
tracking the speaker&apos;s foci as they change over the
discourse. A hearer does not have privileged informa-
tion about what is in a particular speaker&apos;s head, so
the hearer must decide what the speaker is talking
about on the basis of what the speaker uses as initial
referring expressions and subsequent co-specifying
anaphoric expressions. The hearer follows a focus and
checks to see if the anaphoric expressions which the
speaker uses either co-specify with the hearer&apos;s repre-
sentation of that focus or specify a representation

related to it. The hearer is said to be tracking the
speaker&apos;s focus because she or he can determine what
is being talked about only after the speaker has said
something. Focus, as it is used here, is akin to Grosz&apos;s
notion [1977] of immediate focus.
A process model of focusing and focus tracking
consists of three distinct processors. The first chooses
foci based on what the speaker initially says. The
algorithm for this choice depends on many phenomena
— see Sidner 1979 for details. Then an interpreter (the
pronoun interpreter) uses these foci and a set of rules
of pronoun interpretation (hereafter &amp;quot;pi-rules&amp;quot;) to
interpret the anaphoric expressions in the discourse.
This interpreter, like a human hearer, must keep in
mind whatever other newly mentioned elements the
speaker has introduced, since sometimes an anaphor
may co-specify with one of those instead of the ele-
ments in focus. A third process updates the foci by
decisions that depend on anaphoric interpretations
chosen by the pronoun interpreter. During this last
phase, the updating process moves one of the foci to a
new element of the discourse, if some anaphor co-
specified with that new element while no anaphor
co-specified with the phrase already in focus. The
three processes taken together sketch a simple model
of focus tracking; the model appears to behave like its
human counterpart in the way it interprets anaphors
and in the instances in which it fails to &amp;quot;understand.&amp;quot;
So far, the process model looks circular. Foci are
chosen, they are used to determine how anaphors co-
specify with the foci and then the co-specifiers are
used to determine what&apos;s in focus. In fact, the model
is not circular, but its steps are cyclic. The processor
cycles through the three processes for each sentence in
the discourse. This cycling differs from logical circu-
larity because it depends on new information present-
ed over time, the time of each sentence of the dis-
course.
For example, reconsider the first few sentences of
D2, given previously. Initially the speaker mentions
two dogs, which become the discourse focus, and then
he extends the discussion of them using &amp;quot;one...the
other&amp;quot; anaphors. The actor focus is the speaker. Us-
ing a definite noun phrase anaphor &amp;quot;the poodle,&amp;quot; the
speaker turns his attention to the that dog, and it be-
comes the discourse focus and the actor focus. Using
another definite noun phrase anaphor &amp;quot;the cocker,&amp;quot;
the speaker changes the discourse focus to the cocker.
The speaker&apos;s concluding sentence expands the dis-
course focus back to both dogs with the use of
&amp;quot;them.&amp;quot;
In Sidner 1979 a machine for choosing and updat-
ing the discourse focus and actor focus is given. The
machine chooses items in the discourse to serve as
&amp;quot;expected&amp;quot; foci after the first sentence of a discourse
and uses the interpretation of pronouns as well as
non-pronoun anaphors to determine whether its ex-
pected choices were correct. The machine updates the
discourse and actor focus after each sentence and
changes foci when the anaphoric expressions no longer
co-specify with the item in focus. This simple machine
tracks the foci from the hearer&apos;s point of view and
shows how the hearer can recognize foci and changes
of foci. In the remaining discussion, it is assumed that
the focus machine can determine a discourse and an
actor focus. Our attention is directed at the following
concerns. How can these two foci be used to interpret
discourse pronouns? What rules are used by the pro-
noun interpreter? How do these rules make use of the
constraints on the theory of pronoun interpretation
discussed earlier in this paper?
The focusing theory of pronoun interpretation can
be outlined as follows. At any time in the discourse
after the first sentence, there are foci that are the
prime candidates for co-specifying with a pronoun.
Also available is a list of alternate candidates, called
potential foci, for each focus. Unless the focus candi-
date is ruled out by certain criteria (to be discussed
below), the pronoun interpreter uses it to determine
the specification of the pronoun. Most of the discus-
sion in this paper concerns the criteria that must be
encoded in the rules for choosing among the foci as
well as the criteria for rejecting a focus in favor of one
of the potential foci.
The proposal made here contains two implicit proc-
essing assumptions, (1) serial processing, and (2) end-
of-sentence processing. By &amp;quot;serial processing&amp;quot;, I
mean that the interpreter checks a focus as a candidate
in interpreting the pronoun, and then if that focus is
unacceptable, checks alternate candidates in turn. By
&amp;quot;end-of-sentence processing&amp;quot;, I mean that pronouns
are not interpreted until the entire sentence has been
syntactically and semantically interpreted. Both of
these criteria could be given up without undermining
the focusing theory. One could envision processing in
parallel by checking the foci and alternates and then
determining the pronoun&apos;s specification from an order-
ing of all those candidates that meet the criteria of
choice. To interpret pronouns before the end of the
sentence, the interpreter could decide using available
information and then review its choice as more of the
sentence is processed. These two implicit processing
assumptions have been made because they simplify the
account of focus and because they reflect an imple-
mented version of one focus system. Further research
will indicate whether these assumptions are too strong
— if so, the focusing theory may be re-tested under
parallel and mid-sentence interpretation assumptions.

The pronouns in the example discourse in the pre-

Candace L. Sidner Focusing for Interpretation of Pronouns
R1: Choose the discourse focus as the co-
specifier of the pronoun. But if the pro-
noun appears in the agent position of the
verb case frame structure, then choose the
actor focus.
R1 is a naive formulation and fails to predict accu-
rately over a wide range of phenomena. It can be
revised to include criteria from syntax, semantics and
pragmatics, as well as criteria about discourse charac-
teristics. In the next several pages, I present criteria
that make use of all four sources of knowledge and
incorporate them into R1 to form a series of pi-rules;
these rules make use of the discourse and actor foci,
the potential foci, and the processing of the focus
machine.
Syntax, semantics and pragmatics can be included
in an initial way by the modification R2:
R2: If a pronoun appears in a verb case frame
relation other than agent, choose the dis-
course focus as co-specifier unless any of
the syntactic, semantic and pragmatic
knowledge constraints rule out the choice.
If the pronoun appears in agent position,
choose the actor focus as co-specifier in
the same way.
Ruling out a co-specifier on the basis of syntactic
and semantic constraints is accomplished by computing
the various syntactic relationships and restrictions
(such as Lasnik&apos;s disjoint reference rules) and by use
of semantic selectional restrictions on case frame cate-
gories. How one uses general knowledge constraints is
not so obvious; one wants to avoid the problems of
control on inference mentioned previously.
The focus rule above, although only a skeleton of
the full rules needed, contains the basis for control of
inferences. Under the method of rule R2, inference is
no longer used to find a binding for the pronoun act-
ing as a variable by forward and backward chaining.
Instead inference is a constraint-checking process.
The context up to the sentence under interpretation is
integrated into memory; when a co-specifier is chosen
for the pronoun, inferring serves only to find a contra-
diction in the database. The database will also include
an interpreted form of the sentence with the pronoun,
with the pronoun replaced by its specification as pre-
dicted from the phrase in focus. Only when a contra-
diction is found, is the suggested specification given up
in favor of another choice. The foci of the discourse
can be additionally helpful in database inference be-
cause only that part of the database that concerns
what is in focus needs to be explored for contradic-
tions. Some research on truth maintenance systems
[Doyle 1978, McAllester 1978] has experimented with
constraint-checking and developed algorithms for effi-
ciently finding and undoing contradictions; however,
no one has considered how to explore only certain
&amp;quot;sub-sections&amp;quot; of a database for contradictions.
On this account of inferring and pronoun interpre-
tation, the inference machine must still infer proposi-
tions and reach contradictions. However, this method
reduces the search needed to make sense of the new
sentence because specific choices for the pronouns are
given; when a contradiction is reached, a new choice is
made rather than either blindly binding the pronoun to
some other object or blindly searching for some other
proposition to change, so that the contradiction is
eliminated.
When a suggested co-specifier for a pronoun must
be given up, the pronoun interpreter must use the
potential foci as possible co-specifiers. However, the
interpreter&apos;s actual choices require consideration of
several matters, and before any rules can be stated,
several motivating cases must be presented.

D3-1 Alfred and Zohar liked to play baseball.
2 They played it everyday after school
before dinner.
3 After their game, Alfred and Zohar had
ice cream cones.
4 The boys thought they tasted really good.
5 Alfred always had the vanilla super scooper,
6 while Zohar tried the flavor of the day cone.
7 After the cones had been eaten,
8 the boys went home to study.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99738896">
In D3, Alfred and Zohar are the initial actor focus
while baseball is the initial discourse focus. D3-2
contains two pronouns, &amp;quot;they&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;it&amp;quot; which, ac-
cording to R2, co-specify respectively with Alfred and
Zohar, and baseball. D3-3 uses &amp;quot;their,&amp;quot; which co-
specifies with Alfred and Zohar, but is not accounted
for by rule R2. Furthermore &amp;quot;they&amp;quot; in D3-4 does not
co-specify with baseball but with ice cream cones.
What has happened?
Suppose in addition to the ongoing actor and dis-
course focus, the hearer can consider temporarily any
new entities mentioned in the last sentence that the
hearer has heard. These entities, the potential foci, are
dropped out of processing use if the speaker fails to
mention them a second time; such alternatives are
elements the speaker may want to say more about, but
their importance to the speaker cannot be determined
from one sentence. Thus in D3-2, foci include the
event of playing, and the times &amp;quot;everyday&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;before
dinner,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;after school&amp;quot;. None of these potentials
survives long into the discourse as D3-3 fails to pick
up on any of them. D3-3 in turn introduces some
other potential foci, and one of them, ice cream cones,
is discussed in D3-4; notice also that D3-4 fails to
mention baseball in any way.

R2 must be extended so that it uses the potential
foci whenever criteria from syntax, semantics or prag-
matic knowledge rule out the current actor or dis-
course focus. Thus since &amp;quot;they&amp;quot; in D3-4 cannot co-
specify with baseball (on both syntactic5 and semantic6
grounds), a potential focus is chosen. Potential foci
are ordered according to their thematic relation7 in a
sentence, with semantic case objects first, and agents
last. The first potential focus that meets all the const-
raints is chosen as the co-specifier; in D3, ice cream
cones is the first acceptable potential focus that meets
all the necessary constraints as a co-specifier for
&amp;quot;they.&amp;quot;
Use of this modified pronoun rule follows hand-in-
hand with the focus machine discussed previously.
The machine updates its discourse model after each
sentence by tracking, among other things, pronoun
use. When a pronoun is used to co-specify with a
phrase that is a potential focus, and no phrase co-
specifies the current focus, either the discourse focus
or actor focus moves to that potential focus. Which of
the two foci moves depends on whether the pronoun
fills the agent case in the verb frame, and in the case
of multiple agent cases, whether the ongoing actor
focus is re-mentioned. For example, after D3-4, the
discourse focus changes to ice cream cones because
&amp;quot;they&amp;quot; co-specifies with the ice cream cones; the boys
remain the actor focus, since &amp;quot;they&amp;quot; is not an agent
case for &amp;quot;taste&amp;quot; and since the boys were already the
actor focus.
So far pi-rules take into account the movement of
focus and constraints on syntax, semantics and prag-
matics. However, some of the semantic and pragmatic
criteria must be expanded beyond the simple case
frame semantics and representation of noun phrases
given earlier.
As the reader may have concluded, the interaction
between actor and discourse foci is a complex one; to
supplement the case frame semantics, some functional
notion of theme (in the sense of functionalists such as
Halliday 1967) is needed. For example, the proper
co-specifier for the pronoun in D4-3 cannot be chosen
with R2 and only simple case frame relations.

Although Carl is the actor focus after D4-2, and &amp;quot;he&amp;quot;
in D4-3 is the actor case in the embedded sentence,
the proper choice for the co-specifier is Jeff. Howev-

<bodyText confidence="0.967542677966102">
er, with simple case frame semantics, the interpreter
must consider &amp;quot;Carl&amp;quot; as the co-specifier and then fail
to rule it out (because no syntactic, semantic or
knowledge constraints can eliminate it).
I have designed the pi-rules to use a semantics that
marks verbs like &amp;quot;thinking&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;talking&amp;quot; with who the
thinking or talking was about. D4-3 would indicate
that the speaker thinks about X, that X went to the
Cape with Linda. With this semantics, the interpreter
follows a rule to prefer the discourse focus as the co-
specifier of any pronoun filling the theme position in
such a verb. Since the actor focus is associated with
the agent case, use of such a theme-based rule is con-
sistent with the framework. With such a rule, Jeff is
chosen as the co-specifier of &amp;quot;he,&amp;quot; not because Carl
couldn&apos;t have gone to the Cape with Linda, but be-
cause the speaker is talking about Jeff and his
thoughts about Jeff. In essence this approach takes
the discourse focus as primary, the discourse focus
being what the speaker is talking about so far, while
the actor focus is the locus of information about ac-
tions in the discourse.
The theme-focus rule does not indicate what to do
when the discourse focus and actor focus are both
animate, have the same gender, number and person,
and are both established during the same sentence of
the discourse. People sometimes have difficulty
choosing interpretations in such circumstances. In
D5-2a below, &amp;quot;he&amp;quot; co-specifies with &amp;quot;John&amp;quot; (the actor
focus) but if D5-2b followed D5-1, &amp;quot;he&amp;quot; may co-
specify with either John or Mike (the discourse focus).
D5-1 John called up Mike yesterday.
2 a He wanted to discuss his physics homework.
b He was studying for his driver&apos;s test.
In these cases, native speakers report that the co-
specifier for the pronoun is ambiguous. If the pro-
noun fills an agent case, the actor is preferred, but this
preference is not a strong one. It appears that in such
cases the ambiguity may not be easily resolved unless
additional information about the two foci is known
that stipulates that the sentence is true of only one.
Potential foci can be sub-categorized as either po-
tential discourse foci or as potential actor foci. A
potential actor is a noun phrase which specifies a data-
base element marked as animate and which does not
occur in agent position. In most sentences, the noun
phrase in agent position contains a descriptive word or
name in the head, and specifies a database element; it
becomes the actor focus. But when the noun phrase
in agent position is a pronoun, it may co-specify with
either the actor focus (if one exists), or a potential
actor. Ambiguities occur when an actor and one po-
tential actor are both present in a previous sentence
and when the discourse focus is a non-actor entity.
An example is given below.

Some native speakers find all of these sentence pairs
ambiguous, while some native speakers find only the
pair s6 followed by s5 ambiguous. These examples are
surprisingly similar to D5. How do some speakers
decide that &amp;quot;he&amp;quot; co-specifies with Monty or Prof.
Darby? It appears that they make a comparison and
choose between the actor focus and the potential actor
on the basis of evidence for their preferred interpreta-
tion. When that evidence is not forthcoming, infor-
mants are confused. Such a behavior suggests that the
inference mechanism should be able to judge prefer-
ences between a given actor and one potential actor.
A computational system that makes such judgments
must have a very rich knowledge base (e.g., to know
that Monty is a male name, and that professors may
be male) and must be able to infer which actor is pref-
erable from that base. A computational framework
for carrying out such subtle judgments is still beyond
the state of the art, although Marcus 1980 has pro-
posed a semantic choice mechanism that must also
weigh evidence for prepositional phrase attachment;
his parser, when attaching prepositional phrases, asks
the semantic processor about its preferences for where
to attach the phrases.
In summary, the interpreter can use the following
condition for these ambiguities.

the appendix to this paper. These rules represent what
can be said about pronoun interpretation in the ab-
sence of any additional information in knowledge rep-
resentation beyond that suggested in the discussion of
co-specification. To interpret certain pronouns, such
as those where a co-specifying phrase does not pre-
cede the pronoun in the discourse, as in D1, we must
consider how knowledge is structured and represented.

5. Focus and Knowledge Representation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998311782608696">
Focusing theory with the syntactic and semantic
representations discussed initially does not include an
account of the representation of sentence pairs such as
D6 where the sentence is ambiguous due to scope of
quantifiers.
D6-1 Wendy showed each girl Bruce knows a cat.
2 a She had found it at Farmer John&apos;s.
b They were all from the same litter.
At present the focusing rules predict only that &amp;quot;a cat&amp;quot;
is the expected discourse focus, but they say nothing
about the scope relations for representing the seman-
tics of the phrase as part of D6-1. Without scope
relations, D6-2b is ruled out by the number agreement
criteria when in fact most speakers say that &amp;quot;they&amp;quot;
co-specifies with the set of cats that may be evoked in
D6-1. Webber 1978 not only argues in detail for rep-
resenting scope relations in the mechanisms for inter-
preting anaphors, but also gives rules for determining
scope in a representation of phrases that may be co-
specifiers.
On Webber&apos;s analysis, D6-1 will have two repre-
sentations for &amp;quot;a cat&amp;quot; and for &amp;quot;each girl Bruce
knows.&amp;quot; The one for &amp;quot;a cat&amp;quot; can be paraphrased as:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.8085284">
1. R1: the cat associated with D6-1 such that Wendy
showed it to each girl Bruce knows.
2. R2: the set of cats, the members of which are asso-
ciated with D6-1 such that Wendy showed (one of)
them to each girl Bruce knows.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998974142857143">
Webber has suggested what the representation must
be, and what remains to be determined is when it is
used. Let us suppose that D6-1 is ambiguous,8 and no
syntactic or semantic processing of it adjudicates the
two readings R1 and R2 for &amp;quot;a cat.&amp;quot; When the pro-
noun interpreter seeks to co-specify &amp;quot;it&amp;quot; in D6-2a
with the discourse focus, both readings will be availa-
ble. The set reading R2 may be eliminated immediate-
ly because of constraints that the co-specifier repre-
sent a singleton, so R1 is left. In contrast, for D6-2b
the reading R1 will be ruled out since &amp;quot;they&amp;quot; requires
a plural co-specifier. This account both explains how
the pronouns may be understood, and also is consist-
ent with Van Lehn&apos;s findings [1978] that people do

8 A question, often raised by Martin (see, for example, Martin
1979), is whether a sentence that is ambiguous among several
readings must be represented by several different structures, one for
each reading. He offers a semantic representation that preserves
ambiguity until some processor demands a refinement. Whether
this approach or an alternative representation containing both
readings is best is still an open question.

not normally disambiguate certain ambiguous quantifi-
er scopes during sentence understanding for sentences
such as D6-1. It is compatible with Van Lehn&apos;s find-
ings because alternative interpretations of scope are
not considered until additional discourse material be-
yond the single sentence is presented.
Webber&apos;s rules also allow the phrase &amp;quot;each girl
Bruce knows&amp;quot; to be interpreted as a prototype, with
the result that &amp;quot;a cat&amp;quot; is also. Most speakers find this
reading very odd, and one can ask how such a reading
is eliminated. Possibly it is never generated, and
Webber&apos;s rules need modification. Alternatively it is
produced, and then is ruled out, either in understand-
ing D6-1 because showing prototypic cats is bizarre,
or because in interpreting &amp;quot;it&amp;quot; for D6-2a, the infer-
ence mechanism balks at Wendy having found a proto-
typic cat at Farmer Brown&apos;s. I think that such read-
ings never occur in the first place, simply because most
speakers, who do not report this reading themselves,
have difficulty understanding the reading when they
are told about it.
Another case of semantic ambiguity, similar to the
one in D6, is illustrated in D7.
D7-1 Sally wanted to buy a vegomatic.
2 She had seen it advertised on TV.
&amp;quot;A vegomatic&amp;quot; may be interpreted specifically, to
mean that there is one particular vegomatic or non-
specifically, to mean that it is one of the many vego-
matics.9 The focusing rules do not distinguish between
the two after D7-1 because, like D6-1, D7-1 is ambi-
guous, and neither interpretation can be chosen with
certainty. When &amp;quot;it&amp;quot; is resolved for co-specification
in D7-2, the inference mechanism must decide that
Sally does not want the very one used in the advertise-
ment on TV. &amp;quot;A vegomatic,&amp;quot; whether understood as
specific or non-specific, specifies a different represent-
ation than &amp;quot;it&amp;quot; does. Therefore the pronoun&apos;s specifi-
cation as a specific vegomatic must be generated from
the ambiguous use.
Suppose, for a moment, that D7-1 is interpreted so
that a representation that maintains ambiguity is avail-
able. When the pronoun interpreter processes a sub-
sequent sentence with a pronoun, it need only rule out
readings if the inference machine discounts as contra-
dictory one of the readings (Sally didn&apos;t want to buy
the very one she saw on TV). If no reading is ruled
out, the co-specifier would remain ambiguous, so that
both the indefinite phrase and the pronoun would have
9 The terms &amp;quot;non-specific&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;specific&amp;quot; are traditional
semantic expressions that bear no relation to &amp;quot;specify&amp;quot; and
&amp;quot;specification.&amp;quot; A non-specific reading of &amp;quot;a dog&amp;quot; would be inter-
preted to produce a representation of an instance of the prototypic
dog; what is represented is a dog which has the characteristics of
the prototypic dog - e.g., an animal with four legs, a tail, medium
size, brown, friendly, barks, and the like.
ambiguous co-specifications. As the next example
shows, there is some evidence for this behavior.
Consider the case shown in D8.
D8-1 Sally bought a vegomatic that had a
broken cutting blade.
2 She had seen it advertised on TV.
&amp;quot;A vegomatic that had a broken cutting blade&amp;quot; in the
context of D8-1 usually means some particular vego-
matic that Sally bought. However, &amp;quot;it&amp;quot; is ambiguous
among the vegomatic Sally bought (the broken one),
some vegomatic (possibly not broken), and a vegomat-
ic that is an instance of prototypic vegomatic. Thus
&amp;quot;it&amp;quot; is three ways ambiguous.
To understand D8-2, the pronoun interpreter does
not distinguish among the three readings, since it ac-
cesses the one provided by the specification in D8-1,
which is the specific reading. To find the specification
of &amp;quot;it,&amp;quot; the inference mechanism must discover that it
is slightly odd (1) for Sally to have seen the vegomatic
with a broken blade which she bought being advertised
on TV, and (2) for Sally to see any broken vegomatics
on TV, and (3) for Sally to have seen the very one she
bought on TV. Then if no other choices for co-
specification are available, the specification of vego-
matic from D8-1 must be used to generate an appro-
priate specification for &amp;quot;it&amp;quot;. Since only unbroken ones
not bought by Sally are appropriate, the specification
of &amp;quot;it&amp;quot; must be generated using only part of the
phrase from D8-1.
This example seems problematic because it places
much weight on the inference machine to decide that
the reading is odd. However, this is likely to be just
where the weight of the decision ought to be; many
native speakers find D8 slightly bizarre because their
first reading is that Sally had seen the vegomatic with
the broken blade advertised on TV. In fact, it appears
that when a specific indefinite noun phrase such as &amp;quot;a
vegomatic&amp;quot; is introduced, and the speaker wants to
turn attention to the non-specific reading, a plural
pronoun is used as shown below:
sl 0 She had seen them advertised on TV.
The plural non-specific reading as in s 10 is mentioned
in the pronoun rules found in the appendix, but the
generation of a specification as in D8-2 is not.
Examples such as D8 are perplexing for another
reason; they are examples of what I call, following
Fahlman 1977, the &amp;quot;copy phenomenon.&amp;quot; The ambigu-
ity centers around the fact that there can be many
copies of an abstract prototype. Automobiles, com-
puter programs, airplane flights and money are other
common cases of entities that exhibit the copy phe-
nomenon. In D9, the interpretation of &amp;quot;it&amp;quot; depends
on whether the speaker is referring to a particular
flight or the normal Sunday flight, a copy of which
American Journal of Computational Linguistics, Volume 7, Number 4, October-December 1981 225

occurred on &amp;quot;this Sunday&amp;quot; because of the use of
&amp;quot;usually&amp;quot;.
D9-1 TWA 384 was so bumpy this Sunday I
almost got sick.
2 It usually is a very smooth flight.
Note that the &amp;quot;it&amp;quot; cannot co-specify with the particular
flight on &amp;quot;this Sunday&amp;quot;. However, it is possible that
the speaker used &amp;quot;TWA 384&amp;quot; to refer to a particular
flight; if this is so, the speaker mixed the specific and
non-specific interpretations for the co-specifier of
&amp;quot;it&amp;quot;. Just as in D8, a specification for the pronoun
must be generated — in this case, a non-specific one
from the specific reading.
Another characteristic anaphora is the bound varia-
ble case described by Partee [1978, 1972]. In D10
below, &amp;quot;him&amp;quot; co-specifies with Archibald, while if the
reflexive &amp;quot;himself&amp;quot; were used, it would involve a vari-
able bound to the quantifier from &amp;quot;every man.&amp;quot;
D10-1 Archibald sat down on the floor.
2 Every man put a screen in front of him.
In linguistic theory, bound variables are assumed to be
represented in sentence semantics; when used in con-
junction with syntactic disjoint reference rules, pro-
nouns within the scope of the quantifier can be distin-
guished from non-scoped ones. Since the pronoun
interpreter takes account of these conditions, it can
easily choose a proper co-specifier for &amp;quot;him&amp;quot; in D10
in terms of the focus, but for &amp;quot;himself&amp;quot; it will recog-
nize the bound relation to &amp;quot;every man.&amp;quot; It is crucial
to these cases that the representation of the interpreta-
tion of a sentence includes scope of quantification,
especially when the scope is unambiguous.

6. Focus Restrictions on Co-specification
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999904957142858">
There are other restrictions on co-specification that
result from the processing of the focus machine. The
focus machine includes a stack on which old foci are
stored when the focus changes. In addition to co-
specifications with current actor and discourse foci, a
speaker may use a pronoun to co-specify a discourse
element that was once in focus but is no longer; Grosz
1977 described and illustrated this behavior for ana-
phoric noun phrases in task-oriented dialogues.
A pi-rule that selects candidates from the focus
stack can capture this behavior. However, the rule
must be further constrained. An anaphor that is in-
tended to co-specify with a stacked focus must not be
acceptable as a co-specifier with either the foci or
potential foci. An example from a literary textlo illus-
trates how.
Was that old lady evil, the one Saul and I
had seen sitting on the porch? I had dreamed
about her. When the trolley car took me and
Saul past her house again this morning, she was
gone. Evil, it had a queer sound to it in Eng-
lish.
[Here the narrative moves on to an incident
in a school classroom. A discussion between the
speaker and a male teacher ensues for five para-
graphs. Then the following paragraph begins:]
She had worn an old brown coat and a green
scarf over her head.
In this example, &amp;quot;she&amp;quot; co-specifies with the old lady
discussed previously. If Potok had told of a discussion
between the speaker and a female teacher, it would no
longer be possible to tell that &amp;quot;she&amp;quot; was co-specifying
with the old woman. While interpreting the reading of
&amp;quot;she&amp;quot; as teacher might be a bit surprising because the
teacher&apos;s clothing was not relevant to the previous
conversation, no inference can rule out that reading
because teachers may wear old brown coats. Hence
the pronoun interpreter must reflect these facts, and it
does so with the stacked focus constraint.
The stacked focus constraint is not stated directly
within the pi-rules. Instead it is implicit in their func-
tion. The condition is as follows: A pronoun cannot
be used to co-specify with a stacked focus when a
current focus is an acceptable co-specification since
that current focus will be taken as the interpretation
and the stacked focus will never come into considera-
tion. The stacked focus constraint is a consequence of
the movement of focus in the focus machinery.
The stacked focus constraint, however, may be
overridden. Grosz (see Deutsch 1975, 1974) has
identified several examples, involving pumps and bolt-
ing operations, that show that a pronoun may co-
specify with the stacked focus even when intervening
material contains possible co-specifiers. Some compli-
cated set of inferences about what can and cannot be
bolted to what, or what can and cannot be loosened
might be able to rule out the intervening possible co-
specifications. However there appears to be too little
delay in understanding for people who read her ex-
cerpts (there is no means of determining whether the
original speaker and hearer experienced any delay in
understanding) to suggest that they are ruling out mul-
tiple possibilities in interpreting the pronouns.11
Hence one may conclude that the speaker and hearer
are taking advantage of their knowledge of the task to
provide a discourse context in which the focusing ma-
chinery can be applied.
How many such discourse interpretation mecha-
nisms exist? While this paper does not address this
question directly, some speculation is possible on the

<bodyText confidence="0.948644791666667">
The previous discussion has assumed that a pro-
noun is always preceded by a co-specifying phrase.
However, this is not always the case, and a complete
theory of pronoun interpretation must address cases
where the co-specifying phrase appears after the pro-
noun, and where no co-specifier exists, but the discus-
sion implies a specification for the pronoun.
Pronouns used with their co-specifiers appearing
after the occurrence of the pronoun have been called
backward anaphora in the linguistic literature; I refer
to them as forward co-specifiers. Two such examples,
s 11 and s12, are given below.
s 1 1 If he comes before the show, give John
these tickets and send him to the theatre.
s12 Near him, Dan saw a snake.
In general the pronoun co-specifies with some noun
phrase interpretation, but the phrase is placed forward
in the discourse. The types of sentences in which this
behavior can occur are limited. In general it seems to
be permitted for fronted sentential prepositional phras-
es (as in s12), subordinate clauses fronted on another
sentence (as in s11), and for sentences containing
co-ordinating conjunctions.12 However, it is excluded,
as far as I can tell, in the following cases:13

s13 * I heard about her job from Mary.
s14 * I spoke about him with John&apos;s wife.
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.993023142857143">
Extensive research in linguistics on forward co-
specifiers (Solan contains a good review) gives reliable
evidence that structural constraints govern it; in par-
ticular, syntactic rules can be stated that determine
when forward co-specifiers are not permitted. The
most recent formulation, by Solan, called the back-
ward anaphora restriction, fails on the cases below,
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.850467">
12 Solan 1978 cites the example:
s15 Penelope grabbed his cane and beat Peter with it.
13 There is some disagreement on s13; Solan claims it is
acceptable. All the native speakers I have asked said they inter-
preted the pronoun as &amp;quot;referring to Mary&amp;quot; only because there were
no other usual choices and because you could hear about a person&apos;s
job from that person. Since all the people I asked informally told
me it was a strange sentence for them, I am assuming that it is
deviant.

but some working modification of it may yet be forth-
coming.
s16 In her room Mary saw a ghost.
s17 I heard about Mary&apos;s job from her.
Whatever the best formulation of the syntactic
rules for forward co-specifiers, they are preferable
only in initial sentences of a discourse. For example,
when s 1 1 occurs in mid-discourse, if a speaker has
been talking about Henry, and just begun mention of
Charles, native speakers will interpret &amp;quot;he&amp;quot; as co-
specifying with Henry, or Charles (if Henry can be
ruled out on basis of some special pragmatic knowl-
edge). The pi-rules using focus behave in exactly this
way. They will permit a forward co-specifier only if
Henry and Charles can be ruled out by syntactic, se-
mantic and world knowledge criteria. Were s 1 1 to
occur when Lydia was in focus, the forward co-
specifier would be possible, and pi-rules mirror this
behavior.
When faced with a pronoun that has no preceding
co-specifier and is not a forward co-specifier, the pro-
noun interpreter relies on a condition that is called the
missing co-specifier condition. In the remainder of this
section, I describe that condition. The pi-rules include
a rule for recognizing that a pronoun is missing its
co-specifier, but they do not offer an interpretation for
such pronouns.
In each of the cases below, the pronoun specifies
some cognitive element that is related to one of the
entities mentioned in either the previous sentence or
the same sentence. These examples14 are different
from the non-specific prototypic readings of pronouns
discussed earlier because no phrase which can be used
as a generator exists.
D11-1 I saw Mr. Smith the other day; you know,
she died last year.
2 John is an orphan. He misses them very
much.
3 Pro-Castro people don&apos;t believe he is a
monster.
4 I went to a concert last night. They
played Beethoven&apos;s ninth.

when I get together with the young guys
to play, I can hardly get it over the net.
With the exception of D11-1, most speaker-hearers are
able to say which is the intended specification of the
pronoun in the cases above. D11-1 can be understood

if the hearer is informed that Mr. Smith had a wife.
However, some of these, especially 1 and 2, are so odd
for most hearers that at first they fail to comprehend
the pronoun. Hearers are divided on the acceptability
of 3, and most hearers find 4 and 5 acceptable. Fur-
thermore, such examples, as far as I can tell, do not
occur naturally in written samples.
This paper does not give an account of just how
such cases are understood. However, the focusing
approach provides some basic structure that may be
useful in generating an explanation for such situations.
In all the multi-sentence cases, the pronoun specifies
something which is closely associated with the focus.
What is problematic is the fact that some speakers
seem unable to understand a pronoun which specifies a
database element that, while related to the item in
focus, represents something that no longer exists, such
as John&apos;s parents in light of John&apos;s orphanhood.
Whatever the manner in which hearers recover specifi-
cations for such pronouns, some principles are needed
which govern why some uses of pronouns are accepta-
ble and others are not.
8. The Problem of Parallelism
The pi-rules give incorrect predictions for certain
uses of pronouns, uses that are difficult to define.
Intuitively, they may be characterized as occurring
when there is a parallel structure between sentences of
a discourse.15 In many of these cases the pi-rules pre-
dict the wrong co-specifier. To understand what is
meant by parallel structure, two simple cases, one in
which the pi-rules do predict correctly, and another in
which they fail, are discussed. In D12, the pronoun
co-specifies with the mud pack, as the pi-rules would
predict. The parallelism of these sentences is reflected
in the semantics of &amp;quot;put on&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;pull off&amp;quot; as well as
in the similarity of the syntactic structure of the two
sentences, each being in imperative mood.
D12-1 Put the mud pack on your face.
2 After 5 minutes, pull it off.
The pi-rules predict the proper co-specifier in D12
because the thematic relations of the verb follow the
similarity of structure. However, in D13 below, the
pronoun &amp;quot;it&amp;quot; co-specifies with rose and not with the
green Whitierleaf (the pi-rule choice). The initial
focus after the first sentence is Whitierleaf, but the
parallel syntactic structure of the sentences seems to
govern a different choice of co-specifier. To summa-
rize, between similarity of structure and the pi-rules,
similarity is preferred as a means of choosing a co-
15 Hobbs 1979 defines a parallel relation between sentences
sO and S1 of a discourse as occurring when propositions PO and P1,
which follow from SO and Si respectively, have identical predicates,
and arguments that are similar (p. 76). This concept of a parallel
relation seems related to my intuitive characterization, but as de-
fined does not capture the cases I discuss.
specifier, so when each gives a different prediction,
similarity of structure must be used.
D13-1 The green Whitierleaf is most commonly
found near the wild rose.
2 The wild violet is found near it too.
At first glance it appears that the pi-rules could be
&amp;quot;fixed&amp;quot; by simply observing that the initial focus is
wrong and that a potential focus should be chosen.
However, no such option is available, for such a &amp;quot;fix&amp;quot;
requires that the inference machine reject the initial
focus. To do so, the inference mechanism needs some
knowledge about the world that indicates the unac-
ceptability. For D13 no such knowledge could possi-
bly be forthcoming since all the flora involved are
found near one another. There is no knowledge to the
effect that violets are found near wild roses and not
near Whitierleafs.16
Another example of parallel structures is shown in
D14. The parallel structures again are reflected in the
similarity of the syntactic forms as well as the seman-
tics of &amp;quot;most&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;mine&amp;quot; After D14-1, the initial
focus is the car radiator that is associated with each
car of &amp;quot;most cars.&amp;quot; Using the focusing rules, the pro-
noun interpreter will take &amp;quot;it&amp;quot; to co-specify with that
radiator. But this prediction is incorrect; &amp;quot;it&amp;quot; co-
specifies with the radiator of the speaker&apos;s car.17
D14-1 On most cars the radiator has a free bolt hook.
2 But on mine, it has a floating bolt hook.
The use of &amp;quot;it&amp;quot; here is similar to the instance of a
prototype for &amp;quot;it&amp;quot; in D8. The two discourse examples
differ because D14-2 has an underlying semantic form
that parallels D14-1. D14-1 specifies a universal set
of cars and says something about one of the parts for
those cars; D14-2 specifies a set of one thing, the
speaker&apos;s car, and says something about a part of it;
the speaker&apos;s car is related to the universal car by
instantiation. Thus &amp;quot;it&amp;quot; in D14-2 is not pointing to
some instance of the prototypic radiator; it co-
specifies with the radiator of the speaker&apos;s car, but
&amp;quot;it&amp;quot; is related intensionally to the &amp;quot;radiator&amp;quot; in D14-
1. The similarity in the underlying semantics of D14-1
and D14-2 must be used in interpreting the pronoun
uses.
One might wish to construct some special-purpose
mechanism that looks for similarities in structure be-
tween two sentences. This method is doomed for two
reasons. First, parallelism exists in many aspects of
language, and it happens at arbitrary levels of struc-
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.783787714285714">
16 In certain cases a special audience may have different
responses to the parallelism above. For example, botanists who
know what flowers are near others might behave differently. But
even special audiences must sometimes use general techniques.
Such is the case in the D13 example, because Whitierleafs exist only
in my imagination.
17 I thank R.C. Moore for suggesting this example.

ture rather than just syntactically. Second, at any
given level, the problem of recognition of parallelism
has plagued computational models of language since
such models were first suggested. For example, pars-
ing of English sentences containing conjunction is as
yet an unsolved problem. Methods tried, such as
those of Woods 1973 in LUNAR, fail because of over-
generalization. Proper computational recognition of
parallelism is still beyond the state of the art.
The fact that interpretation of parallelism has failed
for other aspects of computational models of language
only indicates that the problem is a deep one. The
example below is especially surprising because it dem-
onstrates the use of parallel constructions that may be
found between whole paragraphs in a discourse. The
interpretation of &amp;quot;the schedule,&amp;quot; used anaphorically in
D15-7, is not ambiguous between &amp;quot;SOL,&amp;quot; which is a
kind of schedule, and the transmission schedule; read-
ers recognize that the anaphor is unambiguous presum-
ably because the process described in lines 5-7 paral-
lels the one in lines 2-4. Whatever the proper account
of parallelism for pronominal anaphora, it must also be
generalizable to account for this kind of example.18
D15-1 The SOL is searched for an entry for the
subscriber.
2 If one is found, the subscriber&apos;s relative
transmission time is computed according
to formula-1.
3 The subscriber&apos;s clock transmission time
is computed according to formula-2.
4 When the transmission time has been
computed, it is inserted as the pri-
mary entry in a transmission schedule.
5 For each RATS entry, the RATS&apos;s rela-
tive transmission time is computed
according to formula-1,
6 and the RATS&apos;s clock transmission time is
computed according to formula-2.
7 The RATS transmission times are entered
into the schedule.
One possible consequence of these observations
could be that the focus mechanism should be aban-
doned in favor of some as yet unspecified mechanism
that is able to determine parallel relations among sets
of sentences in a discourse. However, methods for
interpreting pronouns from parallel sentences and par-
agraphs offer no constructive way of interpreting the
pronouns in most of the examples presented in this
paper. Many cases of co-specification occur where
there is no similarity of structure other than the corn-

mon subject-verb-object pattern typical of English
sentences. Since what is being talked about appears in
many constituent positions in sentences of a discourse,
the S-V-0 pattern is too gross a level to specify simi-
larity. Hence, while parallelism is needed to deal with
a certain set of cases for which the pi-rules predict
incorrectly, the pi-rules are effective for many other
cases of co-specification where parallelism would not
be helpful. One may conclude that focus mechanisms
account for one aspect of pragmatic anaphora, and
that some different mechanism is needed to encode
similarities in structure that sometimes occur in dis-
course. This paper does not give an account of such a
mechanism. Rather, the examples above provide some
additional observations about the nature of parallelism
in interpreting pronouns in natural languages.

9. Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999809911764706">
Two claims have been substantiated in this paper.
First, I have shown that focusing is compatible with
linguistic rules for disjoint reference, semantic selec-
tional restrictions, and with representations delimiting
quantifier scope. Furthermore, these sources of infor-
mation are necessary for the pronoun interpretation
rules.
Second, I have demonstrated that focusing helps
control the inference process needed to interpret pro-
nouns. The pronoun interpreter predicts a co-specifier
and then asks the inference machine for confirmation;
when the machine finds a contradiction rather than
consistency, the focusing process produces a new can-
didate co-specifier. In effect, the focusing process and
the inference machine collaborate on pronoun inter-
pretation. In previous Al natural language systems,
interpretation resulted from binding of free variables
when making inference; the inference process could be
characterized as one of proving a consequent from a
set of premises. However, because the consequent of
an inference rule contained free variables, many infer-
ences had to be drawn and then &amp;quot;undone&amp;quot; during the
search for a complete chain of inferences. The focus-
ing approach eliminates this kind of blind binding and
unbinding as well as shortens the inference chain
search.
A part of this paper has described and illustrated
how the pronoun interpretation rules predict the co-
specifiers of pronouns with both the actor and the
discourse focus, and indicated that both actor and
discourse foci are necessary. The rules show how
many constraints — syntactic, semantic, and
pragmatic19 — affect the choice of specification for
pronouns; they also show how many kinds of informa-

tion about the world of the speaker and hearer play a
part in distinguishing the co-specifications of pro-
nouns. By means of the discourse and actor foci, the
pi-rules differentially apply the constraints; the predic-
tions which result are tested in the database represent-
ation of the speaker and hearer&apos;s world. Focusing
captures the effects of foregrounding (cf. Chafe 1975)
since focusing accounts for the co-specifications of
pronouns by means of the foci, and focus movement
indicates how new entities may be foregrounded and
pronominalized.
In this paper I have demonstrated the types of ana-
phoric uses that cannot be explained by the focusing
theory. These uses, the focus &amp;quot;popping&amp;quot; cases de-
scribed by Grosz, and the parallelism cases, illustrate
that in anaphor interpretation, other kinds of processes
that are computationally realizable and controllable
are needed. Furthermore, an adequate syntactic theo-
ry of forward co-specifiers, which remains to be dis-
covered, must be incorporated in the syntactic criteria
for the pronoun interpretation rules.
This paper further specifies the nature of focusing
as it relates to a theory of pronoun interpretation. A
focus-based theory with stipulations for syntax, se-
mantics and inferential knowledge, provides a pre-
dictive and explanatory theory of pronoun interpreta-
tion. The theory is predictive because it stipulates
legal and illegal pronoun uses as well as their interpre-
tations; the limits of its predictive power have been
demonstrated as well. The theory is explanatory be-
cause several observations about anaphora in English,
all crucial to focusing theory, can account for each of
the rules: that pronouns are signals of what is being
discussed, that whenever the discussion changes, pro-
nouns must signal the new element of discussion with-
out confusion, and that hearers make use of syntactic,
semantic, and pragmatic knowledge in a controlled
way in understanding anaphors. A theory of anaphor
interpretation different from the focusing theory needs
either to use these observations in an account of the
facts or to demonstrate why these observations are not
relevant to the interpretation process.

1. When a sentence in which a pronoun occurs is the sec-

2. Theme rule: When the pronoun occurs in an embedded
sentence, if the embedded sentence is marked as having
a theme that is either the discourse or actor focus, test
the focus in that theme position as the co-specifier of the
pronoun.
3. Potential actor ambiguity condition: Whenever a pronoun
may co-specify the actor focus, and a single potential
actor exists, expect a possible ambiguity. To resolve, (1)
if there is evidence supporting the actor focus as the
co-specifier, but not the potential actor, then the actor
focus is the co-specifier. (2) When evidence supports
the potential actor but not the actor focus, choose the
potential actor as the co-specifier. (3) However, if there
is evidence for both, choose the actor focus but indicate
ambiguity.
4. Pronominalized actor focus rule: When the actor focus
was last mentioned with a pronoun, if the agent position
pronoun is of the same gender and person as the actor
focus, it must co-specify with the actor focus. If it does
not, a potential actor focus may be chosen, but the pro-
noun use is odd.
5. Plural rule: If the pronoun in question is plural, while
the actor focus is singular, test items in the following list
for co-specification: a non-specific reading of the focus
(only for foci that specify non-human entities), actor
focus and potential actor foci, all the potential actor foci
together, the discourse focus, and the potential discourse
foci.
6. Basic rule: Test the actor foci as a co-specifier with a
pronoun in agent position followed by potential actor
foci. If these fail, check the discourse focus, potential
discourse foci and actor focus stack.
7. Closure rule: Should all other rules fail, if the pronoun
occurs in an introductory clause, expect a forward co-
specifier. If the pronoun is not in an introductory
clause, an instance of the missing co-specifier condition
has occurred.
Non-agent position pronouns
1. When a sentence in which a pronoun occurs is the sec-
ond sentence of a new discourse, the recency rule may
be applied. Recency rule: When a pronoun is in subject
position and is the initial phrase in a sentence, and if a
member of the potential (discourse or actor) foci occurs
as the last phrase in the previous sentence, test the pro-
noun for co-specifying with that potential focus.
2. Basic rule: Check the discourse focus, followed by po-
tential discourse foci, followed by the actor focus.
3. Plural pronoun rule: If the discourse focus is singular
and the pronoun is plural, test the non-specific reading
(only for foci that specify non-human entities) for co-
specification, then potential discourse foci, followed by
the actor focus.
4. Focus related item rule: If some discourse entity has
been related to the focus during the discourse, test it for
co-specifying with the pronoun in question.
5. Focus stack: Check items in the focus stack for co-
specifying in last-in first-out order.
6. Closure rule: When all the above rules fail, if the pro-
noun occurs in an introductory clause, expect a forward
co-specifier. Otherwise the pronoun is an instance of a
missing co-specifier.

<abstract confidence="0.995683">Recent studies in both artificial intelligence and linguistics have demonstrated the need for a theory of the comprehension of anaphoric expressions, a theory that accounts for the role of syntactic and semantic effects, as well as inferential knowledge in explaining how are understood. paper a new approach, based on a theory of the process of focusing on parts of the discourse, is used to explain the interpretation of anaphors. The concept of a speaker&apos;s foci is defined, and their use is demonstrated in choosing the interpretations of personal pronouns. The rules for choosing interpretations are stated within a framework that shows: how to control search in inferring by a new method called constraint checking; how to take advantage of syntactic, semantic and discourse constraints on interpretation; and how to generalize the treatment of personal pronouns, to serve as a framework for the theory of interpretation for all anaphors.</abstract>

By means of the discourse and actor foci, the pi-rules differentially apply the constraints; the predictions which result are tested in the database representation of the speaker and hearer&apos;s world. Focusing captures the effects of foregrounding (cf. Chafe 1975) since focusing accounts for the co-specifications of pronouns by means of the foci, and focus movement indicates how new entities may be foregrounded and pronominalized. In this paper I have demonstrated the types of anaphoric uses that cannot be explained by the focusing theory. These uses, the focus &amp;quot;popping&amp;quot; cases described by Grosz, and the parallelism cases, illustrate that in anaphor interpretation, other kinds of processes that are computationally realizable and controllable are needed.

The stacked focus constraint is not stated directly within the pi-rules. Instead it is implicit in their function. The condition is as follows: A pronoun cannot be used to co-specify with a stacked focus when a current focus is an acceptable co-specification since that current focus will be taken as the interpretation and the stacked focus will never come into consideration. The stacked focus constraint is a consequence of the movement of focus in the focus machinery. The stacked focus constraint, however, may be overridden. Grosz (see Deutsch 1975, 1974) has identified several examples, involving pumps and bolting operations, that show that a pronoun may cospecify with the stacked focus even when intervening material contains possible co-specifiers. Some complicated set of inferences about what can and cannot be bolted to what, or what can and cannot be loosened might be able to rule out the intervening possible cospecifications. However there appears to be too little delay in understanding for people who read her excerpts (there is no means of determining whether the original speaker and hearer experienced any delay in understanding) </context>

The database will also include an interpreted form of the sentence with the pronoun, with the pronoun replaced by its specification as predicted from the phrase in focus. Only when a contradiction is found, is the suggested specification given up in favor of another choice. The foci of the discourse can be additionally helpful in database inference because only that part of the database that concerns what is in focus needs to be explored for contradictions. Some research on truth maintenance systems [Doyle 1978, McAllester 1978] has experimented with constraint-checking and developed algorithms for efficiently finding and undoing contradictions; however, no one has considered how to explore only certain &amp;quot;sub-sections&amp;quot; of a database for contradictions. On this account of inferring and pronoun interpretation, the inference machine must still infer propositions and reach contradictions.

The plural non-specific reading as in s 10 is mentioned in the pronoun rules found in the appendix, but the generation of a specification as in D8-2 is not.

Focus Restrictions on Co-specification There are other restrictions on co-specification that result from the processing of the focus machine. The focus machine includes a stack on which old foci are stored when the focus changes. In addition to cospecifications with current actor and discourse foci, a speaker may use a pronoun to co-specify a discourse element that was once in focus but is no longer; Grosz 1977 described and illustrated this behavior for anaphoric noun phrases in task-oriented dialogues. A pi-rule that selects candidates from the focus stack can capture this behavior. However, the rule must be further constrained. An anaphor that is intended to co-specify with a stacked focus must not be acceptable as a co-specifier with either the foci or potential foci. An example from a literary textlo illustrates how.

So far pi-rules take into account the movement of focus and constraints on syntax, semantics and pragmatics. However, some of the semantic and pragmatic criteria must be expanded beyond the simple case frame semantics and representation of noun phrases given earlier. As the reader may have concluded, the interaction between actor and discourse foci is a complex one; to supplement the case frame semantics, some functional notion of theme (in the sense of functionalists such as Halliday 1967) is needed.

Furthermore all of the inferencebased approaches to pronoun interpretation fail to offer any theoretical approach because they rely on a simple mechanism, (simple variable binding between pronoun and some other phrase) which does not apply in many uses of anaphors, such as Dl. Discourse approaches to anaphora include a technique similar to the inference method; one identifies sentence pairs and determines their semantic relationship as one of elaboration, similarity, contrast, parallel structure; the pronouns are interpreted by variable binding between items of the sentence pairs [Hobbs 1979]. Webber 1978, using a notion of &amp;quot;discourse identifications&amp;quot; (that contain certain semantic and discourse content) similar to the notion of specification, stipulates constraints on the representation of relations among items mentioned in a discourse. Grosz [1977, 1978, 1981] illustrates how parts of a speaker&apos;s knowledge, relevant to a discourse segment, are highlighted via focusing, a process that reflects what a speaker says and the nature of the knowledge in the space. She shows that the structure of a task affects what items will be focused on in the discourse. Reichman has expanded this </context>

The traditional definition encounters difficulty right from the start; it is founded on the notion that one word in a sentence refers or points back to another word or phrase in the (same or another) sentence. But words don&apos;t refer back to other words [Morgan 1978]; people use words to refer to entities in the world. In particular they use pronouns to refer to entities which have already been mentioned in a discourse. Since an anaphoric phrase does not refer to an antecedent, one might want to claim that both the antecedent and the anaphor co-refer to the same entity.

The foci of the discourse can be additionally helpful in database inference because only that part of the database that concerns what is in focus needs to be explored for contradictions. Some research on truth maintenance systems [Doyle 1978, McAllester 1978] has experimented with constraint-checking and developed algorithms for efficiently finding and undoing contradictions; however, no one has considered how to explore only certain &amp;quot;sub-sections&amp;quot; of a database for contradictions. On this account of inferring and pronoun interpretation, the inference machine must still infer propositions and reach contradictions.

The hearer is said to be tracking the speaker&apos;s focus because she or he can determine what is being talked about only after the speaker has said something. Focus, as it is used here, is akin to Grosz&apos;s notion [1977] of immediate focus. A process model of focusing and focus tracking consists of three distinct processors. The first chooses foci based on what the speaker initially says. The algorithm for this choice depends on many</context>

Initially the speaker mentions two dogs, which become the discourse focus, and then he extends the discussion of them using &amp;quot;one...the other&amp;quot; anaphors. The actor focus is the speaker. Using a definite noun phrase anaphor &amp;quot;the poodle,&amp;quot; the speaker turns his attention to the that dog, and it becomes the discourse focus and the actor focus. Using another definite noun phrase anaphor &amp;quot;the cocker,&amp;quot; the speaker changes the discourse focus to the cocker. The speaker&apos;s concluding sentence expands the discourse focus back to both dogs with the use of &amp;quot;them.&amp;quot; In Sidner 1979 a machine for choosing and updating the discourse focus and actor focus is given. The machine chooses items in the discourse to serve as &amp;quot;expected&amp;quot; foci after the first sentence of a discourse and uses the interpretation of pronouns as well as non-pronoun anaphors to determine whether its expected choices were correct. The machine updates the discourse and actor focus after each sentence and changes foci when the anaphoric expressions no longer co-specify with the item in focus. This simple machine tracks the foci from the hearer&apos;s point of view and shows how the hearer can recognize foci and</context>

Although Carl is the actor focus after D4-2, and &amp;quot;he&amp;quot; in D4-3 is the actor case in the embedded sentence, the proper choice for the co-specifier is Jeff. Howev5 since &amp;quot;they&amp;quot; is a plural pronoun and baseball is singular, 6 since the discourse items filling the object case of taste should be tastable items, 7 This type of ordering is motivated by the determination of an initial focus. See Sidner 1979 for details. er, with simple case frame semantics, the interpreter must consider &amp;quot;Carl&amp;quot; as the co-specifier and then fail to rule it out (because no syntactic, semantic or knowledge constraints can eliminate it). I have designed the pi-rules to use a semantics that marks verbs like &amp;quot;thinking&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;talking&amp;quot; with who the thinking or talking was about. D4-3 would indicate that the speaker thinks about X, that X went to the Cape with Linda. With this semantics, the interpreter follows a rule to prefer the discourse focus as the cospecifier of any pronoun filling the theme position in such a verb. </context>

In general, it appears that discourses permitting violations of the stacked focus constraint must contain an implicit structure of task completion that guides the hearer to a context in which the foci for that context may be re-used. Without this structure the hearer cannot decide that the speaker intended for the pronoun to co-specify with something other than the representation of the object currently under discussion. 7.

Extensive research in linguistics on forward cospecifiers (Solan contains a good review) gives reliable evidence that structural constraints govern it; in particular, syntactic rules can be stated that determine when forward co-specifiers are not permitted. The most recent formulation, by Solan, called the backward anaphora restriction, fails on the cases below, 12 Solan 1978 cites the example: s15 Penelope grabbed his cane and beat Peter with it. 13 There is some disagreement on s13; Solan claims it is acceptable. All the native speakers I have asked said they interpreted the pronoun as &amp;quot;referring to Mary&amp;quot; only because there were no other usual choices and because you could hear about a person&apos;s job from that person.

Discourse approaches to anaphora include a technique similar to the inference method; one identifies sentence pairs and determines their semantic relationship as one of elaboration, similarity, contrast, parallel structure; the pronouns are interpreted by variable binding between items of the sentence pairs [Hobbs 1979]. Webber 1978, using a notion of &amp;quot;discourse identifications&amp;quot; (that contain certain semantic and discourse content) similar to the notion of specification, stipulates constraints on the representation of relations among items mentioned in a discourse.

At present the focusing rules predict only that &amp;quot;a cat&amp;quot; is the expected discourse focus, but they say nothing about the scope relations for representing the semantics of the phrase as part of D6-1. Without scope relations, D6-2b is ruled out by the number agreement criteria when in fact most speakers say that &amp;quot;they&amp;quot; co-specifies with the set of cats that may be evoked in D6-1. Webber 1978 not only argues in detail for representing scope relations in the mechanisms for interpreting anaphors, but also gives rules for determining scope in a representation of phrases that may be cospecifiers. On Webber&apos;s analysis, D6-1 will have two representations for &amp;quot;a cat&amp;quot; and for &amp;quot;each girl Bruce knows.&amp;quot; The one for &amp;quot;a cat&amp;quot; can be paraphrased as: 1.

Second, at any given level, the problem of recognition of parallelism has plagued computational models of language since such models were first suggested. For example, parsing of English sentences containing conjunction is as yet an unsolved problem. Methods tried, such as those of Woods 1973 in LUNAR, fail because of overgeneralization. Proper computational recognition of parallelism is still beyond the state of the art. The fact that interpretation of parallelism has failed for other aspects of computational models of language only indicates that the problem is a deep one. The example below is especially surprising because it demonstrates the use of parallel constructions that may be found between whole paragraphs in a discourse.
