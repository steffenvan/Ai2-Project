There is plenty of evidence that emotion
analysis has many valuable applications.
In this study a blog emotion corpus is con-
structed for Chinese emotional expression
analysis. This corpus contains manual an-
notation of eight emotional categories (ex-
pect, joy, love, surprise, anxiety, sorrow,
angry and hate), emotion intensity, emo-
tion holder/target, emotional word/phrase,
degree word, negative word, conjunction,
rhetoric, punctuation and other linguistic
expressions that indicate emotion. An-
notation agreement analyses for emotion
classes and emotional words and phrases
are described. Then, using this corpus,
we explore emotion expressions in Chi-
nese and present the analyses on them.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999952826086957">
Textual emotion analysis is becoming increasingly
important due to augmented communication via
computer mediated communication (CMC) inter-
net sources such as weblogs, email, websites, fo-
rums, and chat rooms. Especially, blogspace con-
sists of millions of users who maintain an online
diary, containing frequently-updated views and
personal remarks about a range of issues.
Despite the increased focus on analysis of web
content, there has been limited emotion analy-
sis of web contents, with the majority of studies
focusing on sentiment analysis or opinion min-
ing. Classifying the mood of a single text is a
hard task; state-of-the-art methods in text classi-
fication achieve only modest performance in this
domain (Mishne, 2005). In this area, some of
the hardest problems involve acquiring basic re-
sources. Corpora are fundamental both for devel-
oping sound conceptual analyses and for training
these emotion-oriented systems at different lev-
els: to recognize emotions, to express appropriate
emotions, to anticipate emotions, and other emo-
tion processing applications.
In this study we propose a relatively fine-
grained annotation scheme, annotating emotion in
text at three levels: document, paragraph, and sen-
tence. We select eight emotion classes (expect,
joy, love, surprise, anxiety, sorrow, angry and hate)
for this annotation, and explore various linguis-
tic expressions that indicate emotion in Chinese.
The annotation scheme has been employed in the
manual annotation of a corpus containing 1,487
documents, with 11,255 paragraphs, 35,096 sen-
tences, and 878,164 Chinese words. Then, using
this corpus, we explore and present data analy-
ses on emotions, involving emotion states, accom-
panying emotions, transfer emotions, independent
emotions in texts.
The remainder of this paper is organized as fol-
lows. Section 2 describes the emotion corpus an-
notation scheme. Section 3 presents the inter-
annotator agreement study. Section 4 describes
the analysis of emotion expressions. Section 5
presents a review of current emotion corpora for
textual emotion analysis. Section 6 concludes this
study with closing remarks and future directions.

2 Blog Emotion Corpus Annotation
Scheme
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999759714285714">
Weblogs are an increasingly popular mode of
communication in the ever changing online world.
Writing suits the recording of facts and the com-
munication of ideas, and their textual basis makes
them equally suitable for recording emotions and
opinions. So, we select blogs as object and data
source for this emotion corpus annotation.

are the couplings between affective states and their
patterns of expressions” (Picard, 1997).
In this study we propose an emotional expres-
sion space model to represent emotion in text,
which is hierarchical in consistent with the natural
structure of a document. Emotion of a document
is represented by a vector
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.993222">
I=&lt; e1, e2, ..., ez, ..., en &gt; (1)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9951684375">
Here, ez is a basic emotion class contained in doc-
ument d. The values of ez range from 0.0 to 1.0
(discrete), indicating the intensities of the basic
emotion classes. Similar to a document, emotion
of each paragraph and each sentence in a docu-
ment is represented by an emotion vector.
Basic emotions may be defined in many ways.
To decrease confusions on emotion categories’ se-
lection and to contain the most common emotion
classes in blogs, we select eight emotion classes
(expect, joy, love, surprise, anxiety, sorrow, angry
and hate) for this manual annotation, and they are
agreed by eleven annotators through a testing an-
notation period. Table 1 shows the numbers of the
eight emotion classes in documents, paragraphs,
and sentences in this corpus.

2.2 The Multi-level Annotation Frame
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9987730625">
The annotation frame includes 3 levels: docu-
ment, paragraph, and sentence. Sentence level
is the basic level for emotion annotation; the an-
notation includes intensities of the eight basic
emotion classes, emotion holder/target, emotional
words/phrases, rhetoric, emotional punctuations,
emotion objective/subjective and emotion polarity.
Paragraph level is the upper level of sentence level;
the annotation includes intensities of the eight ba-
sic emotion classes, topic words to reflect the topic
of a paragraph, and the number of topic sentence
that can express the main points of this paragraph.
Document level is the uppermost level; its anno-
tation is similar to paragraph level. The tokenized
text files are organized into XML documents. An
example document is listed in Figure 1.

2.3 Sentence Level Annotation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99983775">
Sentences are basic units for emotional expres-
sion. The central aim of sentence level annotation
is to explore as much linguistic expressions for re-
flecting emotion in Chinese as possible.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.594066">
a) Emotion holder/target
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999742">
In the task of opinion analysis, the problem of
opinion holder identification has also been stud-
ied, (Bethard, Steven et al., 2004; Choi, Cardie,
et al., 2005; Kim and Hovy, 2005). As for emo-
tion holder/target identification, little research has
been conducted, but we believe it is important for
exploring emotional expression and emotion anal-
ysis. Emotion holder is the one who holds the
emotions, and an emotion target is the object of
an emotion holder. For instance,
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.66610725">
(1) 我喜欢这个老师。(English: I like this
teacher.) In sentence (1),我“ (English: I)” is the
emotion holder, and 这 个 老 师“(English: this
teacher.)” is the emotion target.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.992675166666667">
In this corpus, not every sentence is annotated
with emotion holder or emotion target, and emo-
tion holder or emotion target may not appear in
pairs in one sentence. If one sentence has more
than one emotion holders or emotion targets, they
are all annotated.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.571302">
b) Emotional words and phrases
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999312547169811">
Lexicon-based methods have received a lot of
attention in opinion analysis task. There are many
lexical resources for these tasks. For emotion anal-
ysis tasks, the function of words is equally funda-
mental. In most sentimental lexicons, the words
usually bear direct emotions or opinions, such as
happy or sad, good or bad. However, there are a
lot of sentences can evoke emotions without direct
emotional words, for example,
(2)春天在孩子们的眼里、在孩子们的心
里。(English: Spring is in children’s eyes, and in
their hearts.)
In sentence (2), we may feel joy, love or ex-
pect delivered by the writer. Indeed, as (Ortony,
Andrew, et al., 1987) indicates, besides words di-
rectly referring to emotional states and for which
an appropriate lexicon would help, there are words
that act only as an indirect reference to emotions
depending on the context.
In this annotation scheme, direct emotional
words and indirect emotional words in a sen-
tence are all annotated. In sentence (2), 春
天“(English: spring)”, 孩 子 们“(English: chil-
dren)” are labeled. An emotional word or phrase
is represented as a vector to record its intensi-
ties of the eight basic emotional classes. For in-
stance, the vector for the word 喜 欢“(English:
like)” 2Vi = (0.0, 0.3, 0.9, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)
indicates the emotions of weak joy and strong
love. For indirect emotional words, we anno-
tate their emotion vectors according to their con-
texts, for example, the possible emotion vec-
tor for the word “春天(English: spring)” 2Vi =
(0.1, 0.3, 0.3, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0) indicates the
emotions of weak expect, joy and love. (The emo-
tions and intensity values may be different because
of different annotators).
Emotional phrases are combination of words,
such as Chinese proverbs, like “世上无难事 ,
只要肯攀登(English: Where there is a will, there
is a way) ”. For an emotional phrase, the positions
of its first and character in a sentence are labeled,
and also for emotional words if there are Chinese
word segmentation mistakes.
The statistics show that 84.9% of all emotional
words have one emotion, and 14.7% have two
emotions, only 0.4% have three or four emotions,
but they are indispensable for expressing complex
feelings in use of language.
Table 2 shows the numbers of emotional words
with different POS (part-of-speech) tags. The set
of POS includes 35 classes; Table 2 lists the top
five classes.

As shown in Table 2, verbs, nouns, adjectives
and adverbs are strong markers of emotion in Chi-
nese.
c) Degree words, negative words, conjunc-
tions
Degree words are associated with the intensi-
ties of emotions. In Chinese, degree words ap-
pear with high frequency. In this corpus, there
are 1,039 different degree words annotated, the to-
tal occurring number of them is 16,713, in which,
8,294 degree words modify emotional words or
phrases directly. Degree words and the modifying
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.9967626">
contents are all labeled.
Negative words can be placed almost every-
where in a sentence to change the meaning, also
to change the emotions. Negative words are fre-
quently used in Chinese. The statistical data shows
that there are 645 different negative words anno-
tated in this corpus, the total occurring number of
them is 13,750, in which, 3,668 negative words
modify emotional words or phrases directly.
Besides, conjunctions may change the emotion
of a sentence. for example,
(3) 19�EI_�-IATF
TAC.(Jin guan wo men xi huan zhe ge lao shi,
dan ta yi jing li kai le wo men; English: Although
we like this teacher, she has leaved.)
Sentence (3) uses the conjunctions “9�
�...19...(jin guan...dan..., English: although)”
express emotions of love and sorrow. There
are 297 different conjunctions annotated in this
corpus. Conjunctions and the modifying contents
are all labeled. If conjunctions appear in pairs
in a sentence, the position of pairing words
for each conjunction are also labeled. For the
above sentence (3), conjunctions are annotated as
follows (Figure. 2).
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.993201">
Figure 2: An example of conjunctions annotation
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.9019590625">
Figure 3 shows the growth curve of word num-
ber with document number from 300 to 1487. As
can be seen from Figure 3, the increase numbers of
emotional words/phrases slow down with the in-
crease in the number of documents, and the num-
bers of negative words, degree words and conjunc-
tions basically remained stable. We can look for-
ward to containing most of common emotional ex-
pressions in weblogs articles.
d) Rhetorics, punctuations
Chinese rhetoric has been well studied from
the view of linguistics and literature. We se-
lect nine common rhetoric categories to anno-
tate: EL (English: metaphor), English: �
t(exaggeration), 4TJ A(English: personifica-
tion), Xf f r%(English: antithesis or parallel), 44V
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.996602">

<bodyText confidence="0.993955675675676">
EL(English: parallelism sentence), i�tfa7(English:

,*q(English: irony). Especially, i, ,*q(English:
irony) is a way as to imply the contrary of what one
says, if a sentence is annotated with irony, its emo-
tions maybe totally different from the emotions of
words that it contains. We annotate rhetoric cate-
gory and the corresponding emotion category.
Punctuation is the use of standard marks and
signs in writing to separate words into sentences,
clauses, and phrases in order to clarify meaning.
Some punctuation marks can express emotions,
for example, an exclamation mark (!) or a question
mark (?) is used at the end of a sentence to show
strong emotion. Balog, Mishne, et al. (2006) sug-
gests that people relied on four strategies includ-
ing punctuation to express happiness versus sad-
ness. Punctuation effect is also shown in (Leshed
and Kaye, 2006) to extend to emoticon placement
in website text messages. We annotate punctua-
tion with emotion and the corresponding emotion
category.
e) Emotion objective/subjective, emotion po-
larity
Distinguishing a sentence between factual and
subjective information could support for many
natural language processing applications. Objec-
tive and subjective in our annotation scheme is to
distinguish a sentence between writer’s emotion
and non-writer’s emotion.
There is a positive side or a negative side on
emotion. We call this an emotional polarity. Emo-
tion polarity of a sentence is determined by inte-
grating its emotions. A sentence without emotion
is annotated with neutral.
An annotation tool is developed for this corpus

Emotion annotation is a hard task because the na-
ture of emotion is inherently ambiguous. In the
process of annotation, annotators were encouraged
to follow their “first intuition”. To measure agree-
ment on various aspects of the annotation scheme,
three annotators independently annotated 26 doc-
uments with a total of 270 paragraphs, 701 sen-
tences.
and phrases identified by annotators a and b. This
sentence was preprocessed by Chinese segmenta-
tion and tagged with part-of-speech.

3.1 Agreement for Emotion Classes
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.960991882352941">
The kappa coefficient of agreement is a statistic
adopted by the Computational Linguistics com-
munity as a standard measure for this purpose
(Carletta, 1996). We measured two agreements for
emotion classes’ annotation:
Agreement (a): the agreement on classifi-
cation of containing or not containing some
emotions. In this case, we distinguish two
classes: emotion intensity ei ∈ {0.0} or ei ∈
{0.1, 0.2,0.3,0.4,0.5,0.6,0.7,0.8,0.9, 1.0};
Agreement (b): the agreement on classifica-
tion of emotion intensity. In this case, we dis-
tinguish four classes: ei ∈ {0.0} or ei ∈
{0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4}, or ei ∈ {0.5, 0.6, 0.7}, or ei ∈
{0.8, 0.9,1.0}.

3.2 Agreement for Emotional Words and
Phrases
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999975590909091">
Measuring agreement for emotional words and
phrases is to verify that annotators agree on which
expressions should be marked. To illustrate this
agreement problem, consider the emotional words
In sentence (4), the two annotators agree that
“阳光”, “优美”, “秋高气爽” and “璀璨” can ex-
press emotion. In addition, annotator a marked the
word “金光”, and annotator b marked the word
“沐浴” .
In this task, there is no guarantee that the an-
notators will identify the same set of expressions.
Thus, to measure agreement we want to consider
how much intersection there is between the sets
of expressions identified by the annotators. We
use the following voting-agreement metric to mea-
sure agreement in identifying emotional words
and phrases.
Metric voting-agreement is defined as follows.
Let A, B and C be the sets of expressions anno-
tated by annotators a, b and c respectively. The
expert coder is the set of expressions that agreed
by at least two annotators, see Equation 2.

“Emotion state in text” is the state of combined
emotions in a text unit. An emotion state is repre-
sented by 8 binary digits, each digit corresponding
to a basic emotion class respectively. As an exam-
ple, a document emotion state “01100000” is the
state of combined emotions by joy and love.
The statistics show that, in this corpus, there
are 149 different emotion states in all of the 1,487

the 11,255 paragraphs, and 143 different emotion
states in all of the 35,096 sentences respectively.
That indicates the set of emotion state in texts is
relatively small. We also found some basic emo-
tions tend to combine together, such as {expect,
joy, love}, {anxiety, sorrow}, {angry, hate}. How-
ever, some emotions have small or scarce possibil-

When a text unit (a document, a paragraph, or
a sentence) only contains one emotion class, this
emotion class is an independent emotion. The
statistics show that emotion of love has high in-
dependence, however, joy, surprise and angry has
relative low independence. The intuition is love
can be the only topic emotion in a text unit, but
emotions of joy, surprise and anxiety more incline

Previous approaches to textual emotion analysis
have employed some different corpora. Mishne
(2005) experimented mood classification in blog
posts on a corpus of 815,494 blog posts from Live-
journal (http://www.livejournal.com), a free we-
blog service with a large community. Livejour-
nal also used as data source for finding happi-
ness (Mihalcea and Liu, 2006), capturing global
mood levels (Mishne and De Rijke, 2006), clas-
sifying mood (Jung, Park, et al., 2006; Jung,
Choi, et al., 2007), discovering mood irregu-
larities (Balog, Mishne, et al., 2006), recogniz-
ing affect (Leshed and Kaye, 2006). A similar
emotion corpus in Chinese is Yahoo!’s Chinese
news (http://tw.news.yahoo.com), which is used

for Chinese emotion classification of news read-
ers (Lin, Yang, et al., 2007) and emotion lexi-
con building (Yang, Lin, et al., 2007). Tokuhima
(2008) also use web as data resources to obtain
a huge collection of emotion-provoking event in-
stances for Japanese emotion classification. More
and more weblogs have added mood column to
record blog users’ moods when they read or write
a blog.
Two merits let them well accepted as emotion
corpora: a large number of weblogs contained and
moods annotated by blog users. However, there is
a great inconsistency on emotion categories given
by different websites. Livejournal gives a pre-
defined list of 132 common moods, while Ya-
hoo!’s Chinese news provides readers 8 emotion
categories. Too many mood classes may confuse
users, and Mishne (2005) also pointed out one ob-
vious drawback of the mood “annotation” in this
corpora is that they are not provided in a consistent
manner; the blog writers differ greatly from each
other, and their definitions of moods differ accord-
ingly. In addition, some words are not fitted to be
taken as emotion classes, such as “useful” in Ya-
hoo!’s emotion categories. These corpora may be
helpful for analyzing the global moods on a full
text, but the inconsistent emotion categories is a
problem, and no more labeled information can be
exploited from them.
The emotion analysis on sentence level may
also be important for more detailed emotion anal-
ysis systems. Alm, Roth, et al. (2005) ex-
plore the text-based emotion prediction problem;
they annotated a corpus of 22 Grimms’tales on
sentence level with eight emotion categories (an-
gry, disgusted, fearful, happy, sad, positively sur-
prised, negatively surprised), contain 1580 sen-
tences. Neviarouskaya, Prendinger et al. (2007)
address the tasks of recognition and interpreta-
tion of affect communicated through text messag-
ing. They collected 160 sentences labeled with
one of nine emotions categories (anger, disgust,
fear, guilt, interest, joy, sadness, shame, and sur-
prise) from a corpus of online diary-like blog
posts and a corresponding intensity value. Aman
and Szpakowicz (2007) classify emotional and
non-emotional sentences based on a knowledge-
based approach. They used a corpus with tags
of emotion category, emotion intensity and the
words/phrases that indicate emotion in text. An
emotion corpus for Japanese was built for rec-
ognizing emotions and emotion estimation (Ren,
2009; Matsumoto, 2006). However, the sizes of
these corpora seem not enough for large scale tex-
tual emotion analysis, a lot of linguistic features
are not reflected from them. A more fine-grained
opinion and emotion corpus is the MPQA Corpus
(Wiebe, Wilson, et al., 2005), which contains 535
news articles (10,000-sentence) from a wide va-
riety of news sources, manually annotated at the
sentential and subsentential level for opinions and
other private states. But emotion categories are not
included in it.
To the best of our knowledge, at present, there’s
no relatively large corpora annotated with detailed
linguistic expressions for emotion in Chinese, and
we believe that such corpora would support the de-
velopment and evaluation of emotion analysis sys-
tems.

6 Conclusions and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998824413793103">
In this study we proposed an emotional expres-
sion space model. Emotion of a document, a para-
graph, a sentence, or even a word is represented
by an emotional vector. Based on this model,
we described a relatively fine-grained annotation
scheme and annotated emotion in text. We also
gave the inter-annotator agreement study on an-
notation. Then, we explore the emotional expres-
sions in texts.
This annotated dataset can be obtained for free
with license 1. Eleven annotators made efforts
on it spanning a period of ten months (They are
Ph.D and M.S. candidates specialize in Natural
Language Processing and Emotion Analysis). To
ensure the quality of this dataset, each document
was performed a three pass annotation, in which
the first pass is annotated by one annotator and
then the second and the third verification pass were
performed by other two annotators. The process
of this corpus annotation is easy to make mistakes
because of a lot of information should be anno-
tated. The verification pass is to check the an-
notation mistakes (such as the start and end po-
sitions of emotional phrases in sentences), but not
to change the choices of emotion classes or emo-
tional words which had been annotated by other
annotators.
Using this corpus, we will make a more exten-
sive study of textual emotion analysis in Chinese,

for example, the influence of degree words, nega-
tive words, or other elements on emotional expres-
sion; the difference between subjective emotion
and objective emotion; emotion transfer tracking.
More applications also will be explored, such as
emotional summarization, emotional question an-
swering; emotional topic discovering. At the same
time, new research problems will arise, for exam-
ples, how to acquiring more emotional words and
to generate their emotional vectors automatically;
how to generate emotional vectors for sentences,
paragraphs and documents with known emotional
elements in them? There is need to immerge fur-
ther into these problems.

Especially, blogspace consists of millions of users who maintain an online diary, containing frequently-updated views and personal remarks about a range of issues. Despite the increased focus on analysis of web content, there has been limited emotion analysis of web contents, with the majority of studies focusing on sentiment analysis or opinion mining. Classifying the mood of a single text is a hard task; state-of-the-art methods in text classification achieve only modest performance in this domain (Mishne, 2005). In this area, some of the hardest problems involve acquiring basic resources. Corpora are fundamental both for developing sound conceptual analyses and for training these emotion-oriented systems at different levels: to recognize emotions, to express appropriate emotions, to anticipate emotions, and other emotion processing applications.

The statistics show that emotion of love has high independence, however, joy, surprise and angry has relative low independence. The intuition is love can be the only topic emotion in a text unit, but emotions of joy, surprise and anxiety more incline to combine with other emotions. 5 Related work Previous approaches to textual emotion analysis have employed some different corpora.

Punctuation is the use of standard marks and signs in writing to separate words into sentences, clauses, and phrases in order to clarify meaning. Some punctuation marks can express emotions, for example, an exclamation mark (!) or a question mark (?) is used at the end of a sentence to show strong emotion. Balog, Mishne, et al. (2006) suggests that people relied on four strategies including punctuation to express happiness versus sadness. Punctuation effect is also shown in (Leshed and Kaye, 2006) to extend to emoticon placement in website text messages.

We measured two agreements for emotion classes’ annotation: Agreement (a): the agreement on classification of containing or not containing some emotions. In this case, we distinguish two classes: emotion intensity ei ∈ {0.0} or ei ∈ {0.1, 0.2,0.3,0.4,0.5,0.6,0.7,0.8,0.9, 1.0}; Agreement (b): the agreement on classification of emotion intensity. In this case, we distinguish four classes: ei ∈ {0.0} or ei ∈ {0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4}, or ei ∈ {0.5, 0.6, 0.7}, or ei ∈ {0.8, 0.9,1.0}.

The intuition is love can be the only topic emotion in a text unit, but emotions of joy, surprise and anxiety more incline to combine with other emotions. 5 Related work Previous approaches to textual emotion analysis have employed some different corpora. Mishne (2005) experimented mood classification in blog posts on a corpus of 815,494 blog posts from Livejournal (http://www.livejournal.com), a free weblog service with a large community.

So, we select blogs as object and data source for this emotion corpus annotation. 2.1 Emotional Expression in Text An important starting point in constructing this corpus is to represent emotion in text. One of the biggest questions in affect recognition is, “What 1446 Proceedings of the 2009 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1446–1454, Singapore, 6-7 August 2009. c�2009 ACL and AFNLP are the couplings between affective states and their patterns of expressions” (Picard, 1997). In this study we propose an emotional expression space model to represent emotion in text, which is hierarchical in consistent with the natural structure of a document. Emotion of a document is represented by a vector I=&lt; e1, e2, ..., ez, ..., en &gt; (1) Here, ez is a basic emotion class contained in document d. The values of ez range from 0.0 to 1.0 (discrete), indicating the intensities of the basic emotion classes. Similar to a document, emotion of each paragraph and each sentence in a document is represented by an emotion vector. Basic emotions may be defined in many ways. To decrease conf</context>

Neviarouskaya, Prendinger et al. (2007) address the tasks of recognition and interpretation of affect communicated through text messaging. They collected 160 sentences labeled with one of nine emotions categories (anger, disgust, fear, guilt, interest, joy, sadness, shame, and surprise) from a corpus of online diary-like blog posts and a corresponding intensity value. Aman and Szpakowicz (2007) classify emotional and non-emotional sentences based on a knowledgebased approach. They used a corpus with tags of emotion category, emotion intensity and the words/phrases that indicate emotion in text. An emotion corpus for Japanese was built for recognizing emotions and emotion estimation (Ren, 2009; Matsumoto, 2006). However, the sizes of these corpora seem not enough for large scale textual emotion analysis, a lot of linguistic features are not reflected from them. A more fine-grained opinion and emotion corpus is the MPQA Corpus (Wiebe, Wilson, et al., 2005), which contains 535 news art</context>

The central aim of sentence level annotation is to explore as much linguistic expressions for reflecting emotion in Chinese as possible. a) Emotion holder/target In the task of opinion analysis, the problem of opinion holder identification has also been studied, (Bethard, Steven et al., 2004; Choi, Cardie, et al., 2005; Kim and Hovy, 2005). As for emotion holder/target identification, little research has been conducted, but we believe it is important for exploring emotional expression and emotion analysis. Emotion holder is the one who holds the emotions, and an emotion target is the object of an emotion holder. For instance, (1) 我喜欢这个老师。(English: I like this teacher.) In sentence (1),我“ (English: I)” is the emotion holder, and 这 个 老 师“(English: this teacher.)” is the emotion target. In this corpus, not every sentence is annotated with emotion holder or emotion target, and emotion holder or emotion target may not appear in pair</context>
