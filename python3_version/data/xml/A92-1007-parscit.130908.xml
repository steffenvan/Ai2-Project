Weather reports are created in various modes —
natural language text, specialized language text,
tables and maps. The system presented allows the
user to define his needs of weather information and
requirements on the form of presentation. The
system analyzes a dataset obtained through spe-
cific procedures of forecasting or observation, plans
the product according to the user requirements
and generates its components. Special emphasis is
placed on the coherence of the report by investigat-
ing the rhetorical structures observed in this kind
of text and the coordination between a map and a
text specifying it. The method of generation is a
knowledge-based one with three types of knowledge
employed in the system – terminological, rhetori-
cal and grammatical. A prototype has been imple-
mented and tested with original datasets.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.989868739726028">
The generation of information products stepped into
a new phase characterized by the intensive application
of artificial intelligence, computational linguistics and
other modern information technologies. Currently, var-
ious data are collected into databases and specific pro-
cedures are applied for processing those data into fore-
casts, analyses, surveys and other types of information
products. Usually, those products are in numerical form
which is unsuitable for the general audience and even
for many specialists. Therefore this data has to be con-
verted into a human-oriented mode such as natural lan-
guage (NL) text, tables, maps, diagrams. The automatic
conversion requires formalizing the process — a problem
which nowadays cannot be attacked successfully except
by gathering, coupling and employing various types of
knowledge — common sense, about the subject domain,
grammatical, etc.
In this paper, we report on a study of the automatic
generation of multimodal weather reports from observed
or predicted data. This particular problem is significant
both from a practical point of view (various weather re-
ports are to be made every day in many weather cen-
ters all over the world) and for its scientific aspects (it
manifests the basic features of the generation of verbal

Education and Science and the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences.
reports from data). Our work relates closely to three ar-
eas: NL generation, multimodal documents and weather
information processing.
The communicative act performed by the system is the
description of an observed or predicted situation. Other
works that consider analogous communicative acts are
(Davey, 1979) on the description of tic-tac-toe games,
(Kukich, 1983) on the generation of market reports,
(Andre et al., 1988) about simultaneous commenting on
a soccer game recorded as a sequence of digitized video
frames. In our case the situation to be presented is coded
into a dataset obtained through routine procedures of
weather forecasting or observing.
Our approach to NL generation follows the basic steps
as described by McDonald (1987), viz, selection of the
content portions that are to be communicated to the
user, planning the text by adoption of the most suitable
rhetorical schemas, realizing the discourse plan as a sur-
face structure and its rendering as a text. The goal and
the context of the utterance are specified by the user to-
gether with parameters concerning the precision of the
information and the message length. We place special
emphasis on the content production component which
scans the dataset and extracts assertions from it, as well
as on the rhetorical structures observed in weather re-
ports.
Recently an increasing interest has been observed in
the processing of multimodal documents, the research
being focused on the coordination between the differ-
ent modalities (NL, graphics, video images, pointing).
Some projects with intensive research in this area are
XTRA (Algayer et al., 1989), COMET (Feiner and McK-
eown, 1990), ALFresco (Stock, 1991). To a large ex-
tent this aspect of our project was inspired by the WIP
project (Wahlster et al., 1991) in which the coherence of
multimodal discourse is investigated and common sense
knowledge is employed in the coordination between the
textual and the graphical components of instructions for
the use of domestic appliances.
We consider the case of supplementing a weather map
with a verbal note specifying those content portions that
cannot be presented on the map or whose graphical pre-
sentations distort the original information. The system
discovers such deficiencies of the graphical presentation
and generates a verbal comment on the map.
There are various projects concerning the production
of weather reports, each of them setting specific goals

The RAREAS, RAREAS-2 and FoG series of systems
(Bourbeau et al., 1990) developed by one of the most
successful groups in weather report generation shares
many concepts with the current project, the main differ-
ences lying in the specification of the product and in the
modality of the generated documents. Thus the Cana-
dian group deals exclusively with NL forecasts while our
project considers the generation of multimodal reports
and employs diverse means of specifying what one needs
and in what mode he wants to receive the information.
Our previous work (Kerpedjiev, 1990; Kerepedjiev and
Noncheva, 1990) concerns the conversion of weather fore-
casts from textual form to weather maps or texts in an-
other language. This is a translation problem rather than
a generation one. Another feature that makes the previ-
ous work different from the current one is the lack of co-
ordination between the graphical and the textual parts.
Finally, in this project we employ the knowledge-based
approach which allows a higher degree of flexibility and
easy adoption to various types of products.

The architecture of the system is shown in Figure 1. The
initial data for the system are the dataset and a speci-
fication of the final product prepared by the user in the
form of a template. The system works as follows:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.99822905">
1. The monitor interprets the template and succes-
sively calls the scanner, the planner, the text or
map generator, and the formatter with parameters
extracted from the template.
2. The scanner analyzes the dataset and extracts as-
sertions about the weather situation.
3. The planner applies rhetorical and grammatical
knowledge to convert the extracted set of assertions
into a surface structure or a map plan.
4. The text generator makes use of the lexicon to lin-
earize the surface structure into a text; the map
generator creates a cartographical presentation from
the map plan using the visual library.
5. The monitor evaluates the generated text against
parameters specified in the template (e.g. length of
the text), and if the result does not meet the require-
ments of the user, re-activates the previous proces-
sors with adjusted parameters for providing alterna-
tive solutions.
6. The formatter assembles the product.

3.1 Structure of the initial dataset
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999981933333334">
The initial dataset obtained through observations or nu-
merical forecasting techniques is compiled in tabular
form with lines corresponding to the locations, columns
— to the weather elements considered in the report, and
sub columns — to the time instants to which the data
refer. The locations are either the stations where data
is collected or the nodes of a regular grid in which the
numerical forecast is computed.
In our experiments we used weather data collected
through observations made at the main synoptic hours
(00, 06, 12, 18 GMT) in 50 weather stations dispersed
over the territory of Bulgaria. Ten weather elements have
been considered: cloud amount, precipitation type and
amount, wind speed and direction, min and max tem-
peratures, and the phenomena fog, frost, thunderstorm.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997091">
3.2 Intermediary representation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999983947368421">
An intermediary representation is necessary because the
initial dataset describes the weather in terms of a scien-
tifically based model which may not meet the user con-
ceptions. It is intended to accommodate in a language
independent form those facts that will be conveyed to
the user.
What are the major differences between the initial
data and the intermediary representation? Firstly, they
pertain to different territory and time models. While the
locations in a dataset are weather stations or grid nodes,
in the intermediary representation they are administra-
tive and geographic areas known to the audience. The
dataset contains data referring to time instants, whereas
the facts of the intermediary representation refer to parts
of the day (such as morning) and whole days. Hence, the
facts in the intermediary representation summarize the
initial data with respect to time and space.
The second difference concerns the weather models. In
addition to the basic weather elements employed in the

initial dataset, the intermediary representation makes
use of some derived attributes. So, the basic numerical
quantities wind speed and precipitation amount are con-
verted into qualitative characteristics — wind strength
and precipitation intensity, respectively. Particular ex-
amples of other derived attributes are given in section 4.
We call the facts from the intermediary representation
assertions and denote them as quintuples:
( w _atiribuie, w _value , region, period, precision).
The weather attribute and the weather value represent
the goal of the assertion; the region and the time period
form its context; the last component denotes the preci-
sion of the summarization both over time and space and
in the case of facts with derived weather attributes.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997105">
3.3 Structure of the final product
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996801333333333">
The final product is a natural or specialized language
text, a table&apos; and/or graphics. The basic constructs of
those modes are oriented towards the expression of as-
sertions — the atomic content portions extracted from
the dataset. A NL sentence or clause, an icon placed in
a certain position on the map, and a lexical or numerical
weather value put in a cell of the weather table are all
constructs of this type.
Figure 2 illustrates some modes. For example, the
assertion (cloud_amount, overcast, Nor_Bul, morn, high)
expressible through the NL sentence &amp;quot;In the morning it
will be cloudy over North Bulgaria&amp;quot; is represented as a
weather map (Figure 2d) and in the upper left cell of
the weather table in Figure 2c. Weather reports can be
structured in different ways. The text in Figure 2b is an
enumeration type of text with four independent segments
labeled by the regions they pertain to, and the text in
Figure 2a is a sample of a narrative text.

3.4 Specification of the final product
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997422352941176">
The user&apos;s requirements on the final product are speci-
fied by means of a template. It defines the mode, goal
and context of the product, as well as various parameters
concerning the precision of the information, the length of
the message, and the style of text or map. The template
consists of two types of statements: statements defining
the modal structure of the document and content pro-
duction statements.
There are four statements defining the modal struc-
ture of the final product: narration, enumeration, table
and picture. The general format of a modal structure
statement is given below:
&lt;modal_struct_statement&gt;f&lt;external_context&gt;1
&lt;sequence_of_content_production_statements&gt;.
The following examples of statements are intended to
generate a product with the modal and content structure
of the forecast in Figure 2.

<bodyText confidence="0.996433862068966">
The content production statements are value, text an
map. The first type of statement produces the lexicE
presentation of a single weather value (e.g. overcast, c
15°C); the text production statement makes complet
sentences linked in a coherent text; and the map produc
tion statement generates a cartographical presentation c
the assertions by placing icons of the particular weathe
values in certain positions of the map. The format of
content production statement is as follows:
&lt;content_production_statement&gt;
{&lt;goal&gt;;&lt;context&gt;;&lt;parameters&gt;}
The goal is the set of weather attributes in which th
user is interested. The context contains the region an
the time period for which weather information shoul
be extracted. The part of the context given as an e)
ternal context in the modal structure statement make
a heading of the corresponding section, and therefor(
this context may not be explicitly mentioned in the tex
The parameters specifying the produced content portio
are divided into three groups: precision rate, length an
style of the message.
The precision parameter defines the minimum prec
sion rate that must be guaranteed by the generated me:
sage. By specifying a high precision value, we rule ot
vague sentences like &amp;quot;it will be cloudy in some portior
of North Bulgaria&amp;quot; and force the system to retrieve moi
precise assertions from the dataset.
The parameters restricting the length of the messag
are of three types:

4 Terminological knowledge
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999776125">
The terminological knowledge-base (TKB) represents
the weather, territory and time models.
The weather model consists of the set of weather at-
tributes, their domains, relations between some domains,
and rules for calculation of derived attributes. So the
qualitative weather element wind strength with a five-
element ordered domain is calculated from the numerical
basic attribute wind speed by means of the rule:
</bodyText>
<construct confidence="0.9994668">
if w_speed E [0, 2]
if w_speed E [3, 6]
if w_speed E [7,14]
if w_speed E [15, 20]
if w_speed &gt; 20
</construct>
<bodyText confidence="0.99866071875">
The derived weather attribute cloud change with a four-
element nominal scale is calculated by means of a rule
based on the properties monotonicity and amplitude of
the basic attribute cloud amount with a three-element
ordered scale {clear, partly_cloudy, overcast). Similar
rules allow the system to calculate summary weather
attributes. For example, the clouds attribute unifies
the domains of the attributes cloud amount and cloud
change into the domain { clear, partly_cloudy, overcast,
clouds_increase, clouds_decrease, variable).
Two weather values v1 and v2 are considered related if
they represent co-occurring weather characteristics (e.g.
overcast and rain) and opposite if the characteristics are
associated as contrary (e.g. clear and overcast). The
two relations are defined in the TKB by means of the
predicates related(vi, v2) and opposite(vi, v2).
The territory model represents the set of regions, their
carriers and certain logical links between them. The
function carrier(r) returns the set of stations that be-
long to r, thereby allowing us to treat the regions as
sets. The predicate path(ri, r2, , rn) indicates that
there is a path starting from region r1, passing through
and reaching rn.
The time model defines the time periods as inter-
vals of time instants through the functions begin(t) and
end(t). Two relations between time periods supported
by the TKB are partial order (t1 &lt; t2 if end(ti) &lt;
begin(12)) and inclusion (ti C t2 iff [begin(t 1), end(t 1)] C
[begin(12),end(12)]).
The relations between weather values, regions and
time periods are employed in the selection of rhetorical
schemas (cf. section 6).

5 Scanning the dataset
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.984524256410257">
The scanner determines the content portions of the mes-
sage by computing relevant assertions from the dataset.
The monitor calls it with two types of queries specifying
the goal (a single weather attribute), the context and
a parameter concerning either the precision rate or the
maximum number of assertions to be produced:
scanp(clouds, Bul, whole_day, 0.8)
scana(clouds, Bul, whole_day, 3)
The first query makes the scanner extract assertions
about the clouds attribute applied to Bulgaria and the
whole day, and with a precision rate greater than or equal
to 0.8. The second query restricts the maximum number
of assertions that should be extracted to three.
The scanning is carried out in three steps: generation
of a full set of assertions, pruning the full set of assertions
and selection of the final set of assertions.
In the first step, the scanner applies weather verifica-
tion techniques (Kerpedjiev and Ivanov, 1991) to gen-
erate an assertion for each context that belongs to the
query context. Such an assertion contains the weather
value that approximates the data subset corresponding
to that context with the highest precision rate.
In order to avoid a combinatorial explosion during the
selection, the set of assertions is pruned by removing all
assertions that can be inferred from other assertions. (An
assertion ai can be inferred from a2 if both assertions
convey the same weather value, but al relates to a sub-
context of a2 and its precision rate does not excede that
of a2.) The average reduction rate of the pruning is 70%.
The selection of a combination of assertions is first
made independently for each weather value of the goal at-
tribute. A combination of two assertions (w, v, r1, ti , pi)
and (w, v,r2,t2,p2) is evaluated by means of the formula
min(pi ,p2, 1 — p&apos;, 1 — p&amp;quot;) where p&apos; and p&amp;quot; are the pre-
cision rates of the assertions (w, v, r — r5 — r2, t,p1) and
(w, v, r1+ r2, i—i1—t2, p&amp;quot;), respectively, r and t being the
query context. Then the scanner selects the most precise
combinations for the different weather values and returns
them as a response to the query.

6 Planning the report
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999802">
The planner assimilates a set of assertions into a surface
text structure or a map plan. Since planning is essen-
tially a process of arranging the information in a coherent
way, we will consider at first the coherence in weather re-
ports and then will elaborate the planning techniques.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.959883">
6.1 Coherence
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996726137931034">
Coherence can be ensured for the portions created only
by the text production and map production statements
since the modal structure statements combine the con-
stituent parts mechanically without caring for the con-
sistency between them.
Coherence of a text portion is achieved by selecting a
rhetorical schema that suits best the current set of asser-
tions. The main vehicle for ensuring proper organization
of the text content is the employment of existing rela-
tions in the TKB. Indeed, those links represent common
associations and orderings of the objects, and following
any of them while reading or hearing the text will en-
able the user to assimilate the information easily with
minimum cognitive effort.
Based on the analysis of a number of textual weather
forecasts and reports, we have extracted and collected
seven types of rhetorical schemas:
Presentation by weather attributes. An assertion about
a given attribute cannot interpose a sequence of as-
sertions concerning another attribute.
From a summary to details. An assertion with a context
which includes the context of another assertion is
conveyed before the second assertion.
Temporal progression. The assertions are ordered by the
successive time intervals they pertain to.
Spatial progression. The assertions are arranged in such
a way that their regions form a conceptually existin
path.
Coupling related values. Assertions with related values
and intersecting contexts are rendered in a group.
Contrast. Two assertions with opposite values are con-
veyed together to contrast with each other.
Presentation by weather values. The assertions about E.
given attribute with an ordered domain are con-
veyed in successive groups relating to the particula]
weather values.
The problem of supplementing a graphical portior
(created by the map production statement) with a ver
bal comment may arise when the situation presented or
the map is dynamic, imprecise or uncertain. Due to au
lack of proper graphical means of expression for sucl
properties, a text has to be created that specifies the in
formation available on the map. The following exampl,
illustrates the problem.
Suppose that the assertion (phen, fog, Nor_Bul, morn
high) has to be shown on a map created for the whol,
day. A presentation with the pictograph for fog place(
in one or more positions dispersed uniformly over th,
region specified may prove misleading because the im
portant information about the time period is absent. T
resume the correctness of the map the following concis
text message should be created:
&amp;quot;The fog in North Bulgaria will clear by noon.&amp;quot;
It consists of the reference part &amp;quot;the fog in North Bul
garia&amp;quot; and the specification part &amp;quot;will clear by noon&amp;quot;
The reference part identifies the phenomenon throug
elements expressed on the map while the specificatio
part conveys the missing or distorted elements.

6.2 Text planning
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999915">
The conversion of a set of assertions into a surface struc-
ture poses two main problems:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.98631775">
• How to find the most suitable rhetorical structure
of the text?
• How to realize this structure into the surface struc-
ture of cohesive sentences?
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999965210526316">
We employed rhetorical and grammatical knowledge em-
bedded in rules to cope with those problems. For each
rhetorical schema, a rule is formulated whose condition
part evaluates how well the set of assertions is stratified
by the corresponding schema. For example, we regard
a set of assertions as well stratified by a path of regions
if all assertions pertain to the same attribute and time
period and there exists a one-to-one correspondence be-
tween the regions of the path and the regions of the as-
sertions, or a set of assertions is well stratified chrono-
logically if all assertions pertain to the same region and
there is no overlap between their time periods.
Since the conditions of the &amp;quot;temporal progression&amp;quot;
and &amp;quot;spatial progression&amp;quot; rhetorical schemas as described
above are too rigid and so they are rarely satisfied by the
assertions produced by the scanner, we loosened them by
allowing partial instead of full coincidence between the
regions. The grade of similarity between two regions r1
and r2 is defined by the formula:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.989111">
Icarrier(ri) n carrier(r2)I
Icarrier(ri) U carrier(r2)1
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999930542857143">
and they are considered coincident if d(ri, r2) &gt; 0.7.
Thus the set of three assertions concerning the regions
&amp;quot;the lowlands of West Bulgaria&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Central Bulgaria&amp;quot; and
&amp;quot;the Black sea coast&amp;quot; can be successfully mapped out
along the path &amp;quot;West Bulgaria&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Central Bulgaria&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;East Bulgaria&amp;quot;.
There are certain priorities among the rhetorical
schemas. The schemas &amp;quot;presentation by attributes&amp;quot; and
&amp;quot;coupling related values&amp;quot; have priority over the others;
the schema &amp;quot;from a summary to details&amp;quot; has priority over
the temporal and spatial progressions, etc. A rule with
a higher priority than another is applied first, and only
if it fails, then the second rule is tried.
The action part of the chosen rule breaks the set of
assertions into a chain of chunks. The link between
two chunks represents the conversational move that takes
place when the discourse passes from the source to the
target chunk. Then each chunk is broken down into a
sub chain, and so on until a hierarchical discourse struc-
ture is obtained, at the terminal nodes of which are the
assertions of the initial set (cf. Figure 3b).
The conversion into a surface structure proceeds by
applying the rules embedding the grammatical knowl-
edge. They analyze the discourse structure by means of
patterns. The matching of a pattern with a discourse
substructure leads to a transformation of the latter into
the surface structure of a sentence, clause or phrase and
its bounding to the surface structure of the text. In
addition to indicators of the elements of the discourse
structure, the patterns may contain conditions on the
contents of the assertions and on the types of the preced-
ing sentences. Figure 3c shows a portion of the surface
structure realizing the discourse structure in Figure 3b.
The following features characterize the creation of the
surface structure of a text:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.958837136363636">
• A good deal of sentences are constructed on the ba-
sis of impersonal verb phrases typical for weather
description.
• The tense of the verbs is determined by the type of
the report. If it is a forecast, then future tense is
adopted, otherwise — past tense.
• Where appropriate, function words are inserted that
indicate the type of conversational move (e.g. &amp;quot;but&amp;quot;
for contrast, &amp;quot;also&amp;quot; for addition, etc.).
• Certain elements of the context (the region and/or
the time period) are omitted, if implied from the
preceding text or the external context, or are re-
placed by adverbial or relative adverbial phrases
(&amp;quot;there, then, where, when&amp;quot;), if the corresponding
element is implied but the grammatical structure
requires such a phrase.
• The precision rate of the assertions, if lower than
high, is indicated by inserting proper modifiers, such
as &amp;quot;at many places of ...&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;mostly&amp;quot; etc., which
warn the reader to accept the information with some
reservations.
• The word order of the sentences is selected in such

a way that the elements constituting the topics and
the focuses of the consecutive sentences alternate
(Hajieova, 1987). For example, if the region is the
focus of one sentence, it is good to generate the next
sentence with the region being its topic. Thus the
text will flow rhythmically and at a proper pace.

6.3 Supplementing a map with a text
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999945166666667">
A technique of converting a set of assertions into a
weather map has been described in (Kerpedjiev, 1990).
Here we concisely recall the technique and extend it to
allow the generation of text supplements.
The conversion of a set of assertion into a map is based
on the existence of a set of visual objects (pictographs)
and two functions — f and g; f assigns a pictigraph
to each weather value; and g, for each region, deter-
mines the positions where the icons related to a given
attribute should be put in. The algorithm of conver-
sion scans the selected set of assertions and generates the
map plan by replacing each assertion (w, v, r, t, p) with
a list of statements {(q, xi, yi)}i=1,,, where q =
{(xi, Yi)}2:=1 n = g(w, r). A statement (q, x, y) of the
map plan drives the formatter to place icon q in the po-
sition with coordinates (x, y).
Some problems arise with this technique. Firstly, two
pictographs may occur to overlap and distort each other.

Secondly, certain geometrical relations between the icons
of related assertions should be ensured. Thirdly, the in-
formation concerning the time period and the precision
rate is completely ignored by the conversion technique.
The first two problems are resolved by carefully designing
the function g. Information about a time period and/or
precision rate, when necessary, is provided by a verbal
comment as described below.
Suppose that the assertion (w, v, r,t,p) is visualized
on a map representing the weather situation in context
(7), /1). The corresponding map plan will represent the
assertion correctly only if t&apos; C I and p = high. If any
of these relations is violated then the system has to im-
part this information to the user. We call it residual
information or a residue. It consists of a reference part
determined by the weather value (the user associates it
with the corresponding icon) and possibly by the region
(if r n r&apos; r&apos;; the user should identify it with the lo-
cations where the icons are situated) and a specification
part determined by the elements t&apos;nt (if different from t&apos;)
and p (if not high). The grammar for rendering a residue
as a sentence is available in the grammatical knowledge
base. Furthurmore, the residual information can be for-
mulated either as a characteristics of the reference part
(e.g. &amp;quot;the rain in East Bulgaria will be scattered&amp;quot;) or as
a process (e.g. &amp;quot;the rain in East Bulgaria will stop by
noon&amp;quot;).
The planning of a text supplement may face the fol-
lowing problem. Consider the example in section 6.1. If
another assertion occurs about a fog in North Bulgaria
at noon, then the residual information must be adjustec
to the following message:
&amp;quot;The fog in North Bulgaria will clear by the
afternoon&amp;quot;
In order to avoid any inconsistency in the generated mes
sage, the system collects the residues relating to the sam(
weather attribute and region, unifies their specificatior
parts whereby some content portions may partially neu•
tralize each other, and then generates the message.

The text generator converts the surface structure into
text by making use of the phrasal lexicon. For some o
the terminals of the surface structure it provides ready.
made strings, while other terminals have to be refine(
further. For example, if the regions &amp;quot;South Bulgaria&apos;
and &amp;quot;East Bulgaria&amp;quot; occur in the same phrase, the gener
ator will combine them into the contracted form &amp;quot;Soutl
and East Bulgaria&amp;quot;. Whenever possible, the text gener
ator takes care of the diversity of lexical forms by pro
viding different phrases for terminal nodes of the saml
type (compare &amp;quot;much of Bulgaria&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;most areas&amp;quot; ii
the example in Figure 3).
The map generator interprets the map plan and con
verts it into an image by rendering the successive state
ments (cf. section 6.3). The maps contours as well as th(
various icons are prepared in advance and stored in th(
visual library. The text supplements, if any, are prepare(
in the same way as ordinary text portions and attache(
to the bottom of the map.

The formatter composes the document from compo-
nents delivered by the generators. An enumeration struc-
ture is created from the constituting text portions by
inserting the lexical representation of each external con-
text as a heading of the corresponding portion. A table
is composed of phrases produced by the text generator
from a series of values extracted by the scanner.

8 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.778876333333333">
The system presented in this paper interprets a weather
dataset and generates a multimodal report. The follow-
ing features distinguish the method from similar projects
carried out elsewhere:
• Various weather documents have been analyzed to
determine their structures and to define a language
that allows the user to specify the generated prod-
uct with respect to mode, content, style, length and
precision of the information.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.95577475">
• A knowledge-based technique for selection of the dis-
course structure of the generated document has been
devised on the basis of typical rhetorical schemas
and relations defined in the TKB.
• The system controls the precision of the assertions
extracted. Information with a low precision rate is
rendered as a sentence with lexical indicators of im-
precision (e.g. in some portions, possibly), which

<bodyText confidence="0.963860612903226">
warn the user to accept the corresponding assertions
with a certain degree of reservation.
• The cartographical presentation, though superior in
many respects to the textual presentation, still suf-
fers from the lack of proper means of expression for
certain elements such as time and precision of the in-
formation. Therefore, a map may be supplemented
with a concise verbal comment on the underspec-
ified elements. Thus the two modalities, NL and
graphics, complementing each other offer a highly
expressive and efficient weather report.
The system has been implemented in Pascal on an IBM
PC. The TKB is filled in with models of the general-
purpose short-range weather forecasts for Bulgaria. The
grammatical knowledge base and the lexicon contain
styles corresponding to subsets of Bulgarian and English.
Experiments have been performed with datasets com-
piled at the National Weather Service in Sofia.
In order to make the system practical it has to be
coupled with a layout manager. Thus the user will be
able to specify the arrangement of the different units in
the plane.
Another point of future work is the enrichment of the
weather model with attributes summarizing the weather
over a longer period (say five days) taking into account
climatic data. Thus the system will be able to extract
and render more interesting facts about the weather.
A promising research area which may contribute to
the further development of the system is user modeling.
Experimentation in this area can be combined with the
various applications of weather reports.

Thus the Canadian group deals exclusively with NL forecasts while our project considers the generation of multimodal reports and employs diverse means of specifying what one needs and in what mode he wants to receive the information. Our previous work (Kerpedjiev, 1990; Kerepedjiev and Noncheva, 1990) concerns the conversion of weather forecasts from textual form to weather maps or texts in another language. This is a translation problem rather than a generation one. Another feature that makes the previous work different from the current one is the lack of coordination between the graphical and the textual parts. Finally, in this project we employ the knowledge-based approach which allows a higher degree of flexibility and easy adoption to various types of products.

The second query restricts the maximum number of assertions that should be extracted to three. The scanning is carried out in three steps: generation of a full set of assertions, pruning the full set of assertions and selection of the final set of assertions. In the first step, the scanner applies weather verification techniques (Kerpedjiev and Ivanov, 1991) to generate an assertion for each context that belongs to the query context. Such an assertion contains the weather value that approximates the data subset corresponding to that context with the highest precision rate. In order to avoid a combinatorial explosion during the selection, the set of assertions is pruned by removing all assertions that can be inferred from other assertions.

Recently an increasing interest has been observed in the processing of multimodal documents, the research being focused on the coordination between the different modalities (NL, graphics, video images, pointing). Some projects with intensive research in this area are XTRA (Algayer et al., 1989), COMET (Feiner and McKeown, 1990), ALFresco (Stock, 1991). To a large extent this aspect of our project was inspired by the WIP project (Wahlster et al., 1991) in which the coherence of multimodal discourse is investigated and common sense knowledge is employed in the coordination between the textual and the graphical components of instructions for the use of domestic appliances.

The system discovers such deficiencies of the graphical presentation and generates a verbal comment on the map. There are various projects concerning the production of </context>
