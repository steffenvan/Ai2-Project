<bodyText confidence="0.9996374375">
We describe an unsupervised approach to
multi-document sentence-extraction based
summarization for the task of producing
biographies. We utilize Wikipedia to auto-
matically construct a corpus of biographical
sentences and TDT4 to construct a corpus
of non-biographical sentences. We build a
biographical-sentence classifier from these
corpora and an SVM regression model for
sentence ordering from the Wikipedia corpus.
We evaluate our work on the DUC2004
evaluation data and with human judges.
Overall, our system significantly outperforms
all systems that participated in DUC2004,
according to the ROUGE-L metric, and is
preferred by human subjects.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999736">
Producing biographies by hand is a labor-intensive
task, generally done only for famous individuals.
The process is particularly difficult when persons of
interest are not well known and when information
must be gathered from a wide variety of sources. We
present an automatic, unsupervised, multi-document
summarization (MDS) approach based on extractive
techniques to producing biographies, answering the
question “Who is X?”
There is growing interest in automatic MDS in
general due in part to the explosion of multilingual
and multimedia data available online. The goal of
MDS is to automatically produce a concise, well-
organized, and fluent summary of a set of docu-
ments on the same topic. MDS strategies have been
employed to produce both generic summaries and
query-focused summaries. Due to the complexity
of text generation, most summarization systems em-
ploy sentence-extraction techniques, in which the
most relevant sentences from one or more docu-
ments are selected to represent the summary. This
approach is guaranteed to produce grammatical sen-
tences, although they must subsequently be ordered
appropriately to produce a coherent summary.
In this paper we describe a sentence-extraction
based MDS procedure to produce biographies from
online resources automatically. We make use of
Wikipedia, the largest free multilingual encyclope-
dia on the internet, to build a biographical-sentence
classifier and a component for ordering sentences in
the output summary. Section 2 presents an overview
of our system. In Section 3 we describe our cor-
pus and in Section 4 we discuss the components of
our system in more detail. In Section 5, we present
an evaluation of our work on the Document Under-
standing Conference of 2004 (DUC2004), the biog-
raphy task (task 5) test set. In Section 6 we com-
pare our research with previous work on biography
generation. We conclude in Section 7 and identify
directions for future research.

In this section, we present an overview of our biog-
raphy extraction system. We assume as input a set of
documents retrieved by an information retrieval en-
gine from a query consisting of the name of the per-
son for whom the biography is desired. We further
assume that these documents have been tagged with
Named Entities (NE)s with coreferences resolved

using a system such as NYU’s 2005 ACE system
(Grishman et al., 2005), which we used for our ex-
periments. Our task is to produce a concise biogra-
phy from these documents.
First, we need to select the most ‘important’ bio-
graphical sentences for the target person. To do so,
we first extract from the input documents all sen-
tences that contain some reference to the target per-
son according to the coreference assignment algo-
rithm; this reference may be the target’s name or
a coreferential full NP or pronominal referring ex-
pression, such as the President or he. We call these
sentences hypothesis sentences. We hypothesize that
most ’biographical’ sentences will contain a refer-
ence to the target. However, some of these sentences
may be irrelevant to a biography; therefore, we filter
them using a binary classifier that retains only ‘bio-
graphical’ sentences. These biographical sentences
may also include redundant information; therefore,
we cluster them and choose one sentence from each
cluster to represent the information in that cluster.
Since some of these sentences have more salient bi-
ographical information than others and since manu-
ally produced biographies tend to include informa-
tion in a certain order, we reorder our summary sen-
tences using an SVM regression model trained on
biographies. Finally, the first reference to the tar-
get person in the initial sentence in the reordering
is rewritten using the longest coreference in our hy-
pothesis sentences which contains the target’s full
name. We then trim the output to a threshold to pro-
duce a biography of a certain length for evaluation
against the DUC2004 systems.

3 Training Data
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999945727272727">
One of the difficulties inherent in automatic biog-
raphy generation is the lack of training data. One
might collect training data by manually annotating
a suitable corpus containing biographical and non-
biographical data about a person, as in (Zhou et al.,
2004). However, such annotation is labor intensive.
To avoid this problem, we adopt an unsupervised ap-
proach. We use Wikipedia biographies as our corpus
of ’biographical’ sentences. We collect our ‘non-
biographical’ sentences from the English newswire
documents in the TDT4 corpus.1 While each corpus

may contain positive and negative examples, we as-
sume that most sentences in Wikipedia biographies
are biographical and that the majority of TDT4 sen-
tences are non-biographical.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999875">
3.1 Constructing the Biographical Corpus
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999879545454545">
To automatically collect our biographical sentences,
we first download the xml version of Wikipedia
and extract only the documents whose authors used
the Wikipedia biography template when creating
their biography. There are 16,906 biographies in
Wikipedia that used this template. We next apply
simple text processing techniques to clean the text.
We select at most the first 150 sentences from each
page, to avoid sentences that are not critically impor-
tant to the biography. For each of these sentences we
perform the following steps:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.988056115384615">
1. We identify the biography’s subject from its ti-
tle, terming this name the ‘target person.’
2. We run NYU’s 2005 ACE system (Grish-
man et al., 2005) to tag NEs and do coref-
erence resolution. There are 43 unique NE
tags in our corpora, including PER Individual,
ORG Educational, and so on, and TIMEX tags
for all dates.
3. For each sentence, we replace each NE by its
tag name and type ([name-type subtype]) as as-
signed by the NYU tagger. This modified sen-
tence we term a class-based/lexical sentence.
4. Each non-pronominal referring expression
(e.g., George W. Bush, the US president) that
is tagged as coreferential with the target per-
son is replaced by our own [TARGET PER] tag
and every pronoun P that refers to the target
person is replaced by [TARGET P], where P is
the pronoun itself. This allows us to general-
ize our sentences while retaining a) the essen-
tial distinction between this NE (and its role in
the sentence) and all other NEs in the sentence,
and b) the form of referring expressions.
5. Sentences containing no reference to the tar-
get person are assumed to be irrelevant and re-
moved from the corpus, as are sentences with

fewer than 4 tokens; short sentences are un-
likely to contain useful information beyond the
target reference.
For example, given sentences from the Wikipedia
biography of Martin Luther King, Jr. we produce
class-based/lexical sentences as follows:
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.606559125">
Martin Luther King, Jr., was born on January 15, 1929, in Atlanta,
Georgia. He was the son of Reverend Martin Luther King, Sr. and
Alberta Williams King. He had an older sister, Willie Christine
(September 11, 1927) and a younger brother, Albert Daniel.
[TARGET PER], was born on [TIMEX], in [GPE PopulationCenter].
[TARGET HE] was the son of [PER Individual] and [PER Individual].
[TARGET HE] had an older sister, [PER Individual] ([TIMEX]) and a
younger brother, [PER Individual].

3.2 Constructing the Non-Biographical Corpus
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999986888888889">
We use the TDT4 corpus to identify non-
biographical sentences. Again, we run NYU’s 2005
ACE system to tag NEs and do coreference resolu-
tion on each news story in TDT4. Since we have
no target name for these stories, we select an NE
tagged as PER Individual at random from all NEs in
the story to represent the target person. We exclude
any sentence with no reference to this target person
and produce class-based/lexical sentences as above.

4.1 Classifying Biographical Sentences
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999505333333333">
Using the biographical and non-biographical cor-
pora described in Section 3, we train a binary classi-
fier to determine whether a new sentence should be
included in a biography or not. For our experiments
we extracted 30,002 sentences from Wikipedia bi-
ographies and held out 2,108 sentences for test-
ing. Similarly. we extracted 23,424 sentences from
TDT4, and held out 2,108 sentences for testing.
For each sentence, we then extract the frequency of
three class-based/lexical features — unigram, bia-
gram, and trigram — and two POS features — the
frequency of unigram and bigram POS. To reduce
the dimensionality of our feature space, we first sort
the features in decreasing order of Chi-square statis-
tics computed from the contingency tables of the ob-
served frequencies from the training data. We then
take the highest 30-80% features, where the num-
ber of features used is determined empirically for

each feature type. This process identifies features
that significantly contribute to the classification task.
We extract 3K class-based/lexical unigrams, 5.5K
bigrams, 3K trigrams, 20 POS unigrams, and 166
POS bigrams.
Using the training data described above, we ex-
perimented with three different classification algo-
rithms using the Weka machine learning toolkit
(Witten et al., 1999): multinomial naive Bayes,
SVM with linear kernel, and C4.5. Weka also pro-
vides a classification confidence score that repre-
sents how confident the classifier is on each classi-
fied sample, which we will make use of as well.
Table 1 presents the classification results on our
4,216 held-out test-set sentences. These results are
quite promising. However, we should note that they
may not necessarily represent the successful clas-
sification of biographical vs. non-biographical sen-
tences but rather the classification of Wikipedia sen-
tences vs. TDT4 sentences. We will validate these
results for our full systems in Section 5.

4.2 Removing Redundant Sentences
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999985230769231">
Typically, redundancy removal is a standard com-
ponent in MDS systems. In sentence-extraction
based summarizers, redundant sentences are defined
as those which include the same information with-
out introducing new information and identified by
some form of lexically-based clustering. We use
an implementation of a single-link nearest neighbor
clustering technique based on stem-overlap (Blair-
Goldensohn et al., 2004b) to cluster the sentences
classified as biographical by our classifier, and then
select the sentence from each cluster that maximizes
the confidence score returned by the classifier as the
representative for that cluster.

should be presented in the final summary. Present-
ing more important information earlier in a sum-
mary is a general strategy for most domains, al-
though importance may be difficult to determine re-
liably. Similar to (Barzilay and Lee, 2004), we au-
tomatically learn how to order our biographical sen-
tences by observing the typical order of presentation
of information in a particular domain. We observe
that our Wikipedia biographies tend to follow a gen-
eral presentation template, in which birth informa-
tion is mentioned before death information, infor-
mation about current professional position and af-
filiations usually appear early in the biography, and
nuclear family members are typically mentioned be-
fore more distant relations. Learning how to order
information from these biographies however would
require that we learn to identify particular types of
biographical information in sentences.
We directly use the position of each sentence in
each Wikipedia biography as a way of determin-
ing where sentences containing similar information
about different target individuals should appear in
their biographies. We represent the absolute posi-
tion of each sentence in its biography as an inte-
ger and train an SVM regression model with RBF
kernel, from the class/lexical features of the sen-
tence to its position. We represent each sentence by
a feature vector whose elements correspond to the
frequency of unigrams and bigrams of class-based
items (e.g., GPE, PER) (cf. Section 3) and lexical
items; for example, the unigrams born, became, and
[GPE State-or-Province], and the bigrams was born,
[TARGET PER] died and [TARGET PER] joined
would be good candidates for such features.
To minimize the dimensionality of our regres-
sion space, we constrained our feature choice to
those features that are important to distinguish bi-
ographical sentences, which we term biographical
terms. Since we want these biographical terms to
impact the regression function, we define these to
be phrases that consist of at least one lexical item
that occurs in many biographies but rarely more than
once in any given biography. We compute the bio-
graphical term score as in the following equation:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.812082666666667">
n(t)d
bio score(t)=  |Dt  |EdEDt (1 − maxt(n(t)d)) (1)
 |D   ||D |
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9978348">
where D is the set of 16,906 Wikipedia biographies,
n(t)d is the number of occurrences of term t in doc-
ument d, and Dt = {d E D : t E d}. The left factor
represents the document frequency of term t, and the
right factor calculates how infrequent the term is in
each biography that contains t at least once.2 We or-
der the unigrams and bigrams in the biographies by
their biographical term scores and select the high-
est 1K unigrams and 500 bigrams; these thresholds
were determined empirically.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997415">
4.4 Reference Rewriting
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999980392857143">
We observe that news articles typically mention bio-
graphical information that occurs early in Wikipedia
biographies when they mention individuals for the
first time in a story (e.g. Stephen Hawking, the Cam-
bridge University physicist). We take advantage of
the fact that the coreference resolution system we
use tags full noun phrases including appositives as
part of NEs. Therefore, we initially search for the
sentence that contains the longest identified NE (of
type PER) that includes the target person’s full name
and is coreferential with the target according to the
reference resolution system; we denote this NE NE-
NP. If this sentence has already been classified as
a biographical sentence by our classifier, we simply
boost its rank in the summary to first. Otherwise,
when we order our sentences, we replace the refer-
ence to the target person in the first sentence by NE-
NP. For example, if the first sentence in the biogra-
phy we have produced for Jimmy Carter is He was
born in 1947 and a sentence not chosen for inclusion
in our biography Jimmy Carter, former U.S. Presi-
dent, visited the University of California last year.
contains the NE-NP, and Jimmy Carter and He are
coreferential, then the first sentence in our biography
will be rewritten as Jimmy Carter, former U.S. Presi-
dent, was born in 1947. Note that, in the evaluations
presented in Section 5, sentence order was modified
by this process in only eight summaries.

X?”, where X is the name of a person or group of
people, create a short summary (no longer than 665

NIST assessors chose 50 clusters of TREC docu-

Each cluster contained on average 10 documents.
NIST had 4 human summaries written for each clus-

removes redundant sentences. Next, we produce
three versions of each system: one which imple-
ments a baseline ordering procedure, in which sen-
tences from the clusters are ordered by their ap-
pearance in their source document (e.g. any sen-
tence which occurred first in its original document
is placed first in the summary, with ties ordered ran-
domly within the set), a second which orders the
biographical sentences by the confidence score ob-
tained from the classifier, and a third which uses the
SVM regression as the reordering component. Fi-
nally, we run our reference rewriting component on
each and trim the output to 665 bytes.
We evaluate first using the ROUGE-L metric (Lin
and Hovy, 2003) with a 95% (ROUGE computed)
confidence interval for all systems and compared
these to the ROUGE-L score of the best-performing
DUC2004 system.5 The higher the ROUGE score,
the closer the summary is to the DUC2004 human
reference summaries. As shown in Figure 1, our
best performing system is the multinomial naive
Bayes classifier (MNB) using the classifier confi-
dence scores to order the sentences in the biography.
This system significantly outperforms the top ranked
DUC2004 system (top-DUC2004).6 The success of
this particularly learning algorithm on our task may
be due to: (1) the nature of our feature space – n-
gram frequencies are modeled properly by a multi-
nomial distribution; (2) the simplicity of this classi-
fier particularly given our large feature dimensional-

ity; and (3) the robustness of naive Bayes with re-
spect to noisy data: Not all sentences in Wikipedia
biographies are biographical sentences and some
sentences in TDT4 are biographical.
While the SVM regression reordering component
has a slight negative impact on the performance
of the MNB system, the difference between the
two versions is not significant. Note however, that
both the C4.5 and the SVM versions of our system
are improved by the SVM regression sentence re-
ordering. While neither performs better than top-
DUC2004 without this component, the C4.5 system
with SVM reordering is significantly better than top-
DUC2004 and the performance of the SVM sys-
tem with SVM regression is comparable to top-
DUC2004. In fact, when we use only the SVM
regression model to rank the hypothesis sentences,
without employing any classifier, then remove re-
dundant sentences, rewrite and trim the results, we
find that, interestingly, this approach also outper-
forms top-DUC2004, although the difference is not
statistically significant. However, we believe that
this is an area worth pursuing in future, with more
sophisticated features.
The following biography of Brian Jones was pro-
duced by our MNB system and then the sentences
were ordered using the SVM regression model:
Born in Bristol in 1947, Brian Jones, the co-pilot on the
Breitling mission, learned to fly at 16, dropping out of
school a year later to join the Royal Air Force. After earn-
ing his commercial balloon flying license, Jones became
a ballooning instructor in 1989 and was certified as an ex-
aminer for balloon flight licenses by the British Civil Avi-
ation Authority. He helped organize Breitling’s most re-
cent around-the-world attempts, in 1997 and 1998. Jones,
52, replaces fellow British flight engineer Tony Brown.
Jones, who is to turn 52 next week, is actually the team’s
third co-pilot. After 13 years of service, he joined a cater-
ing business and, in the 1980s,...

5.2 Manual Evaluation

<bodyText confidence="0.9999808">
ROUGE evaluation is based on n-gram overlap be-
tween the automatically produced summary and the
human reference summaries. Thus, it is not able to
measure how fluent or coherent a summary is. Sen-
tence ordering is one factor in determining fluency
and coherence. So, we conducted two experiments
to measure these qualities, one comparing our top-
performing system according to ROUGE-L score
(MNB) vs. the top-performing DUC2004 system
(top-DUC2004) and another comparing our top sys-
tem with two different ordering methods, classifier-
based and SVM regression.7 In each experiment,
summaries were trimmed to 665 bytes.
In the first experiment, three native American En-
glish speakers were presented with the 50 questions
(Who is X?). For each question they were given a
pair of summaries (presented in random order): one
was the output of our MNB system and the other
was the summary produced by the top-DUC2004
system. Subjects were asked to decide which sum-
mary was more responsive in form and content to the
question or whether both were equally responsive.
85.3% (128/150) of subject judgments preferred one
summary over the other. 100/128 (78.1%) of these
judgments preferred the summaries produced by our
MNB system over those produced by top-DUC2004.
If we compute the majority vote, there were 42/50
summaries in which at least two subjects made the

nent to see if this reordering component affected hu-
man judgments even if it did not improve ROUGE
scores. For each question, we produced two sum-
maries from the sentences classified as biographi-
cal by the MNB classifier, one ordered by the con-
fidence score obtained by the MNB, in decreasing
order, and the other ordered by the SVM regression
values, in increasing order. Note that, in three cases,
the summary sentences were ordered identically by
both procedures, so we used only 47 summaries
for this evaluation. Three (different) native Amer-
ican English speakers were presented with the 47
questions for which sentence ordering differed. For
each question they were given the two summaries
(presented in random order) and asked to determine
which biography they preferred.
We found inter-rater agreement for these judg-
ments using Fleiss’ kappa (Fleiss, 1971) to be only
moderate (K=0.362). However, when we computed
the majority vote for each question, we found that
61.7% (29/47) preferred the SVM regression order-
ing over the MNB classifier confidence score order-
ing. Although this difference is not statistically sig-
nificant, again we find the SVM regression ordering
results encouraging enough to motivate our further
research on improving such ordering procedures.

The DUC2004 system achieving the highest over-
all ROUGE score, our top-DUC2004 in Section 5,
was Blair-Goldensohn et al. (2004a)’s DefScriber,
which treats “Who is X?” as a definition question
and targets definitional themes (e.g. genus-species)
found in the input document collections which in-
clude references to the target person. Extracted sen-
tences are then rewritten using a reference rewriting
system (Nenkova and McKeown, 2003) which at-
tempts to shorten subsequent references to the tar-
get. Sentences are ordered in the summary based
on a weighted combination of topic centrality, lex-
ical cohesion, and topic coverage scores. A simi-
lar approach is explored in Biryukov et al. (2005),
which uses Topic Signatures (Lin and Hovy, 2000)
constructed around the target individual’s name to
identify sentences to be included in the biography.
Zhou et al. (2004)’s biography generation system,
like ours, trains biographical and non-biographical
sentence classifiers to select sentences to be included
in the biography. Their system is trained on a hand-
annotated corpus of 130 biographies of 12 people,
tagged with 9 biographical elements (e.g., bio, ed-
ucation, nationality) and uses binary unigram and
bigram lexical and unigram part-of-speech features
for classification. Duboue et al. (2003) also ad-
dress the problem of learning content selection rules
for biography. They learn rules from two corpora,
a semi-structured corpus with lists of biographical
facts about show business celebrities and a corpus
of free-text biographies about the same celebrities.
Filatova et al. (2005) learn text features typical
of biographical descriptions by deducing biograph-
ical and occupation-related activities automatically
by compariing descriptions of people with differ-
ent occupations. Weischedel et al. (2004) models

guistic and semantic processing. Linguistic features

are derived from predicate-argument structures de-
duced from parse trees, and semantic features are the
set of biography-related relations and events defined
in the ACE guidelines (Doddington et al., 2004).
Sentences containing kernel facts are ranked using
probabilities estimated from a corpus of manually
created biographies, including Wikipedia, to esti-
mate the conditional distribution of relevant material
given a kernel fact and a background corpus.
The problem of ordering sentences and preserv-
ing coherence in MDS is addressed by Barzi-
lay et al. (2001), who combine chronological order-
ing of events with cohesion metrics. SVM regres-
sion has recently been used by (Li et al., 2007) for
sentence ranking for general MDS. The authors cal-
culated a similarity score for each sentence to the
human summaries and then regress numeric features
(e.g., the centroid) from each sentence to this score.
Barzilay and Lee (2004) use HMMs to capture topic
shift within a particular domain; sequence of topic
shifts then guides the subsequent ordering of sen-
tences within the summary.

In this paper, we describe a MDS system for produc-
ing biographies, given a target name. We present an
unsupervised approach using Wikipedia biography
pages and a general news corpus (TDT4) to automat-
ically construct training data for our system. We em-
ploy a NE tagger and a coreference resolution sys-
tem to extract class-based and lexical features from
each sentence which we use to train a binary classi-
fier to identify biographical sentences. We also train
an SVM regression model to reorder the sentences
and then employ a rewriting heuristic to create the
final summary.
We compare versions of our system based upon
three machine learning algorithms and two sentence
reordering strategies plus a baseline. Our best per-
forming system uses the multinomial naive Bayes
(MNB) classifier with classifier confidence score re-
ordering. However, our SVM regression reorder-
ing improves summaries produced by the other two
classifiers and is preferred by human judges. We
compare our MNB system on the DUC2004 bi-
ography task (task 5) to other DUC2004 systems
and to human-generated summaries. Our system
out-performs all DUC2004 systems significantly,
according to ROUGE-L-1.5.5. When presented
with summaries produced by our system and sum-
maries produced by the best-performing (according
to ROUGE scores) of the DUC2004 systems, human
judges (majority vote of 3) prefer our system’s bi-
ographies in 88.1% of cases.
In addition to its high performance, our approach
has the following advantages: It employs no manual
annotation but relies upon identifying appropriately
different corpora to represent our training corpus.
It employs class-based as well as lexical features
where the classes are obtained automatically from
an ACE NE tagger. It utilizes automatic corefer-
ence resolution to identify sentences containing ref-
erences to the target person. Our sentence reorder-
ing approaches make use of either classifier confi-
dence scores or ordering learned automatically from
the actual ordering of sentences in Wikipedia biogra-
phies to determine the order of presentation of sen-
tences in our summaries.
Since our task is to produce concise summaries,
one focus of our future research will be to simplify
the sentences we extract before classifying them
as biographical or non-biographical. This proce-
dure should also help to remove irrelevant informa-
tion from sentences. Recall that our SVM regres-
sion model for sentence ordering was trained using
only biographical class-based/lexical items. In fu-
ture, we would also like to experiment with more
linguistically-informed features. While Wikipedia
does not enforce any particular ordering of infor-
mation in biographies, and while different biogra-
phies may emphasize different types of information,
it would appear that the success of our automatically
derived ordering procedures may capture some un-
derlying shared view of how biographies are written.
The same underlying views may also apply to do-
mains such as organization descriptions or types of
historical events. In future we plan to explore such a
generalization of our procedures to such domains.

We utilize Wikipedia to automatically construct a corpus of biographical sentences and TDT4 to construct a corpus of non-biographical sentences. We build a biographical-sentence classifier from these corpora and an SVM regression model for sentence ordering from the Wikipedia corpus.

Presenting more important information earlier in a summary is a general strategy for most domains, although importance may be difficult to determine reliably. Similar to (Barzilay and Lee, 2004), we automatically learn how to order our biographical sentences by observing the typical order of presentation of information in a particular domain. We observe that our Wikipedia biographies tend to follow a general presentation template, in which birth information is mentioned before death information, information about current professional position and affiliations usually appear early in the biography, and nuclear family members are typically mentioned before more distant relations.

Note that, in three cases, the summary sentences were ordered identically by both procedures, so we used only 47 summaries for this evaluation. Three (different) native American English speakers were presented with the 47 questions for which sentence ordering differed. For each question they were given the two summaries (presented in random order) and asked to determine which biography they preferred. We found inter-rater agreement for these judgments using Fleiss’ kappa (Fleiss, 1971) to be only moderate (K=0.362). However, when we computed the majority vote for each question, we found that 61.7% (29/47) preferred the SVM regression ordering over the MNB classifier confidence score ordering. Although this difference is not statistically significant, again we find the SVM regression ordering results encouraging enough to motivate our further research on improving such ordering procedures. 6 Related Work The DUC2004 system achieving the highest overall ROUGE score, our top-DUC2004 in Section 5, was Blair-Goldensohn et al.

Our task is to produce a concise biography from these documents. First, we need to select the most ‘important’ biographical sentences for the target person. To do so, we first extract from the input documents all sentences that contain some reference to the target person according to the coreference assignment algorithm; this reference may be the target’s name or a coreferential full NP or pronominal referring expression, such as the President or he. We call these sentences hypothesis sentences. We hypothesize that most ’biographical’ sentences will contain</context>

There are 16,906 biographies in Wikipedia that used this template. We next apply simple text processing techniques to clean the text. We select at most the first 150 sentences from each page, to avoid sentences that are not critically important to the biography. For each of these sentences we perform the following steps: 1. We identify the biography’s subject from its title, terming this name the ‘target person.’ 2. We run NYU’s 2005 ACE system (Grishman et al., 2005) to tag NEs and do coreference resolution. There are 43 unique NE tags in our corpora, including PER Individual, ORG Educational, and so on, and TIMEX tags for all dates. 3. For each sentence, we replace each NE by its tag name and type ([name-type subtype]) as assigned by the NYU tagger. This modified sentence we term a class-based/lexical sentence. 4. Each non-pronominal referring expression (e.g., George W. Bush, the US president) that is tagged as coreferential with the target person is replaced by our own [TARGET PER] tag and every pronoun P that refers to the target person is replaced by</context>

Finally, the first reference to the target person in the initial sentence in the reordering is rewritten using the longest coreference in our hypothesis sentences which contains the target’s full name. We then trim the output to a threshold to produce a biography of a certain length for evaluation against the DUC2004 systems. 3 Training Data One of the difficulties inherent in automatic biography generation is the lack of training data. One might collect training data by manually annotating a suitable corpus containing biographical and nonbiographical data about a person, as in (Zhou et al., 2004). However, such annotation is labor intensive. To avoid this problem, we adopt an unsupervised approach. We use Wikipedia biographies as our corpus of ’biographical’ sentences. We collect our ‘nonbiographical’ sentences from the English newswire documents in the TDT4 corpus.1 While each corpus 1http://projects.ldc.upenn.edu/TDT4 may contain positive and negative examples, we assume that most sentences in Wikipedia biographies are biographical and that the majority of TDT4 sentences are non-biographical. 3.1 Constructing the Biographical Corpus To automatically collect our biographical sentence</context>
