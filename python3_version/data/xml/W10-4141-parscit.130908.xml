In this paper, we present the proposed me-
thod of participating SIGHAN-2010 Chi-
nese word segmentation bake-off. In this
year, our focus aims to quick train and test
the given data. Unlike the most structural
learning algorithms, such as conditional
random fields, we design an in-house devel-
opment conditional support vector Markov
model (CMM) framework. The method is
very quick to train and also show better per-
formance in accuracy than CRF. To give a
fair comparison, we compare our method to
CRF with three additional tasks, namely,
CoNLL-2000 chunking, SIGHAN-3 Chi-
nese word segmentation. The results were
encourage and indicated that the proposed
CMM produces better not only accuracy but
also training time efficiency. The official re-
sults in SIGHAN-2010 also demonstrates
that our method perform very well in tradi-
tional Chinese with fine-tuned features set.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.99989625882353">
Since 2006 Chinese word segmentation bakeoff
in SIGHAN-3 (Levow, 2006), this is the third
time to join the competition (Wu et al., 2006,
2007). In this year, we join the SIGHAN bakeoff
task in both traditional and simplified Chinese
closed word segmentation. Unlike most western
languages, there is no explicit space between
words. The goal of word segmentation is to iden-
tify words given the sentence. This technique
provides important features for downstream pur-
poses. Examples include Chinese part-of-speech
(POS) tagging (Wu et al., 2007), Chinese word
dependency parsing (Wu et al., 2007, 2008).
With the rapid growth of structural learning
algorithms, such as conditional random fields
(CRFs) (Lafferty et al., 2001) and maximum-
margin Markov models (M3N) (Taskar et al.,
2003) have received a great attention and be-
come a prominent learning algorithm to many
sequential labeling tasks. Examples include part-
of-speech (POS) tagging (Shen et al., 2007) and
syntactic phrase chunking (Suzuki et al., 2007).
The Chinese word segmentation can also be
treated as a character-based tagging task in (Xue
and Converse, 2002). One feature of sequential
labeling is that it aims at finding non-recursive
chunk fragments in a given sentence. Among
these approaches, CRF has been wildly used in
recent SIGHAN bakeoff tasks (Jin and Chen,
2008; Levow, 2006).
Although these approaches do not suffer from
so-called label-bias problems (Lafferty et al.,
2001), one limitation is that they are inefficient
to train with large-scale, especially large catego-
ry data. On the other hand, non-structural learn-
ing approaches (e.g. maximum entropy models)
which learn local predictors usually cost much
better training time performance than structural
learning algorithms. These methods condition on
local context features and incorporate fix-length
history information. Although higher order fea-
ture (longer history) maybe useful to some tasks,
the exponential scaled inference time is also in-
tractable in practice.
Support vector machines (SVMs) which is one
of the state-of-the-art supervised learning algo-
rithms have been widely employed as local clas-
sifiers to many sequential labeling tasks (Taku
and Matsumoto, 2001; Wu et al., 2006, 2008).
Specially, the training time of linear kernel SVM
with either L1-norm (Joachims, 2006; Keerthi et
al., 2008) or L2-norm (Keerthi and DeCoste,
2005; Hsieh et al., 2008) can now be obtained in
linear time. Even local classifier-based ap-
proaches have the drawbacks of label-bias prob-
lems, training nonstructural linear SVM is scala-
ble to large-scale data. By means of so-called
one-versus-all multiclass SVM training, it is also
scalable to large-category data.
In this paper, we present our Chinese word
segmentation based on the proposed conditional
support vector Markov models for sequential
labeling tasks, especially Chinese word segmen-
tation. Unlike structural learning algorithms, our
method can be simply trained without consider-
ing the entire structures and hence the training
time scales linearly with the number of training
examples. In this framework, to alleviate the ease
of label-bias problems, the state transition proba-
bility is ignored. Instead, we merely utilize the
property of label relationships between chunks
(Wu et al., 2008). To demonstrate our method,
we compare to several well-known structural
learning algorithms, like CRF (Kudo et al., 2004),
and SVM-HMM (Joachims et al., 2009) on two
well-known data, namely, CoNLL-2000 syntac-
tic chunking, SIGHAN-3 Chinese word segmen-
tation tasks. By following this, we apply the
model to the Chinese word segmentation tasks of
SIGHAN-2010 this year. The empirical results
showed that our method is not only fast but also
achieving more superior accuracy than structural
learning methods. In traditional Chinese, our me-
thod also achieves the state-of-the-art perfor-
mance in accuracy with fined-tune features.

The above decompositions merge the transi-

the locally trained maximum entropy with the

2.1 Tag transitions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999807">
In this paper, we do not explicitly adopt the state
transitions for our CMM. Instead, a chunk-
relation pair is used. Nevertheless, one important
property to sequential chunk labeling is that there
is only one phrase type in a chunk. For example,
if the previous word is tagged as begin of noun
phrase (B-NP), the current word must not be end
of the other phrase (E-VP, E-PP, etc). Therefore,
we only model relationships between chunk tags
to generate valid phrase structure.
Wu et al. (2007, 2008) presented an automatic
chunk pair relation construction algorithm which
can handle so-called IOB1/IOB2/IOE1/IOE2
(Kudo and Matsumoto, 2001) chunk representa-
tion structures with either left-to-right or right-to-
left directions. Here, we extend this idea and ge-
neralize to fit to more chunk tags. That is we can
model the S-tag, B2, B3 tags with dividing the
leading tags into two categories. For details can
refer the literatures.

3 Empirical Results

Three large-scale and large-category dataset is
used to evaluate the proposed method, namely,
CoNLL-2000 syntactic chunking (Tjong Kim
Sang and Buchholz, 2000), Chinese POS tagging,
and three of SIGHAN-3 word segmentation tasks.
Table 1 shows the statistics of those datasets.

CoNLL-2000 chunking task is a well-known
and widely evaluated in many literatures (Suzuki
et al., 2007; Ando and Zhang, 2005; Kudo and
Matsumoto, 2001; Wu et al., 2008; DaumÃ© III
and Marcu, 2005). The training data was derived
from Treebank WSJ section 15-18 while section
20 was used for testing. The goal is to find the
non-recursive phrase structures in a sentence,
such as noun phrase (NP), verb phrase (VP), etc.
There are 11 phrase types in this dataset. We fol-
low the previous best settings for SVMs (Kudo
and Matsumoto, 2001; Wu et al., 2008). The
IOE2 is used to represent the phrase structure
and tagged the data with backward direction.
The training and testing data of the Chinese
POS tagging is mainly derived from the Aca-
demic SinicaÂ¶s balanced corpus (version 3.0).
Seventy-five percent out of the data is used for
training while the remaining 25% is used for test-
ing. However, the task of the Chinese POS tag-
ging is very different from classical English POS
tagging in that there is no word boundary infor-
mation in Chinese text. To achieve this, Ng and
Low (2004) gave a successful study on Chinese
POS tagging. Just as English phrase chunking,
the IOB-tags can be used to represent the Chi-
nese word and its part-of-speech tag. For exam-
ple, the tag B-ADJ means the first character of a
Chinese word which POS tag is ADJ (adjective).
n this task, we simply use the IOB2 to represent
the chunk structure. In this way, the tagger needs
to recognize the chunk tag by considering 118
(59*2) categories at once.
As discussed in (Zhou and Kit, 2007), using
more complex chunk representation bring better
segmentation accuracy in several Chinese word
segmentation benchmarks. It is very useful in
particular to represent long Chinese word (in par-
ticular proper nouns). By following this line, we
apply the six tags B, BI, I, IE, E, and S to
represent the Chinese word. BI and IE are the
interior after begin and interior before end of a
chunk. B/I/E/S tags indicate the be-
gin/interior/end/single of a chunk. Figure 2 lists
the used feature set in both experiments.

As shown in Table 1, it is surprising that the
proposed CMM outperforms the other structural
learning methods, CRF and SVM-HMM. In
terms of training time, our method shows sub-
stantial faster than CRF. However, in terms of
testing time, our method is worse than CRF. The
main reason is that we do not optimize the code
and implementation. We trust this can be further
improved.

Table 2 shows the experimental results of the
SIGHAN-3 bake-off tasks. We ran and con-
ducted the experiments with UPUC, MSRA, and
CityU datasets. The final two rows in Table 5 list
the top 1 and 2 scores of published papers.
Here, the SVM-HMM still suffer from the sca-
lability problems. Similar to the findings in the
Chinese POS tagging task, the zero-order CMM
achieved the optimal accuracy among first-order,
full second order and the proposed inference al-
gorithms. The training time is still very efficient
for most CMMs. In comparison to CRF, our me-
thod did clearly perform better accuracy (ex-
cepted for the CityU) and require much less
training time. For example, for the CityU dataset,
our 0-order CMM took less than 15 minutes to
train, while the CRF takes 4.34 hours in training.
However, we observe that our CMM yielded
better testing time speed than CRF in this task.
We further exploit the trained SVM models and
found that the produced weights were not as
dense as CRF which produces many nonzero
weights per category. In addition, we observed
that our implementation worked very efficient in
the small category tasks.
For the three datasets, our method produced
very competitive results as previous best ap-
proach which also made use of CRF as classifiers.
Although we use the same techniques to de-
rive global features (assessor variety (AV) fea-
ture with 2~6 grams) from both training and test-
ing data, our CMMs and the conducted CRF
could not perform as well as (Zhou and Kit,
2007). In our experiments, both CRF and CMMs
received the same training set. Hence the CRF
and our CMMs is comparable in this experiment.

3.3 Official Results in SIGHAN-2010
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.984891388888889">
To apply CMM to SIGHAN-2010, we design the
following strategy. First the classifier parameters,
feature set should be improved. To achieve this,
1/4 of the training data was used as development
set, while the remaining 3/4 training data was
used to train the classifier. Second, we combine
multi-classifier to enhance the accuracy. The
CRF and our CMM with basic feature set were
trained to predict the initial labels of the testing
data. Then the predicted labels were included as
features to train the final-stage classifier. The
final classifier is still our CMM. Third, the post-
processing method (Low et al., 2005) is em-
ployed to enhance the unknown word segmenta-
tion.
Table 4 lists the empirical results of the devel-
opment set. By validate with development data,
we found that C=1.25 and use the E-BIES repre-
sentation method (Wu et al., 2008) yields better
accuracy than B-BIES (Zhou and Kit, 2007).
Meanwhile, CRF seems to be suitable for B-
BIES representation method.
The classifier parameters were fixed and then
we try to search the optimal feature set via the
incremental add-and-check method. That is, we
use the initial feature set as basis and add one
feature type from the pool and verify the good-
ness of the feature with the development data.
Figure 3 figures out the used features of each
pass.
In this year, the process was completely run-
through for the traditional Chinese task. Unfor-
tunately we have insufficient time to apply the
same technique to Simplified Chinese task. Table

Chinese word segmentation bake-off.

<bodyText confidence="0.99992088">
In this paper, we investigate the issues of sequen-
tial chunk labeling and present the conditional
support vector Markov models for this purpose.
The experiments were conducted with two well-
known datasets, includes CoNLL-2000 text
chunking and SIGHAN-3 Chinese word segmen-
tation. The experimental results showed that our
method scales very well while achieving surpris-
ing good accuracy than structural learning me-
thods. On the SIGHAN-3 task, the proposed me-
thod outperformed CRF, while substantially re-
duced the training time. We also apply such me-
thod to the SIGHAN-2010 traditional Chinese
segmentation with fined tuned feature set. The
result was also encouraged. Our approach ob-
tains the best accuracy in this task. In terms of
Simplified Chinese, we achieve mid-rank place
due to the very limited time-constraint. In the
future, we plan to completely adopt this method
to the Simplified Chinese word segmentation
with the elaborated feature selection metrics and
the same post-processing method.

conditional support vector Markov models can

<abstract confidence="0.995185181818182">In this paper, we present the proposed method of participating SIGHAN-2010 Chinese word segmentation bake-off. In this year, our focus aims to quick train and test the given data. Unlike the most structural learning algorithms, such as conditional random fields, we design an in-house development conditional support vector Markov model (CMM) framework. The method is very quick to train and also show better performance in accuracy than CRF. To give a fair comparison, we compare our method to CRF with three additional tasks, namely, CoNLL-2000 chunking, SIGHAN-3 Chinese word segmentation. The results were encourage and indicated that the proposed CMM produces better not only accuracy but also training time efficiency. The official results in SIGHAN-2010 also demonstrates that our method perform very well in traditional Chinese with fine-tuned features set.</abstract>

Table 1 shows the statistics of those datasets. Feature CoNLL-2000 SIGHAN-3 type Unigram w-2~w+2 w-2~w+2 CoNLL-2000 chunking task is a well-known and widely evaluated in many literatures (Suzuki et al., 2007; Ando and Zhang, 2005; Kudo and Matsumoto, 2001; Wu et al., 2008; DaumÃ© III and Marcu, 2005). The training data was derived from Treebank WSJ section 15-18 while section 20 was used for testing. The goal is to find the non-recursive phrase structures in a sentence, such as noun phrase (NP), verb phrase (VP), etc. There are 11 phrase types in this dataset. We follow the previous best settings for SVMs (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2001; Wu et al., 2008). The IOE2 is used to represent the phrase structure and tagged the data with backward direction.

Instead, a chunkrelation pair is used. Nevertheless, one important property to sequential chunk labeling is that there is only one phrase type in a chunk. For example, if the previous word is tagged as begin of noun phrase (B-NP), the current word must not be end of the other phrase (E-VP, E-PP, etc). Therefore, we only model relationships between chunk tags to generate valid phrase structure. Wu et al. (2007, 2008) presented an automatic chunk pair relation construction algorithm which can handle so-called IOB1/IOB2/IOE1/IOE2 (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2001) chunk representation structures with either left-to-right or right-toleft directions. Here, we extend this idea and generalize to fit to more chunk tags. That is we can model the S-tag, B2, B3 tags with dividing the leading tags into two categories. For details can refer the literatures. 3 Empirical Results Three large-scale and large-category dataset is used to evaluate the proposed method, namely, CoNLL-2000 syntactic chunking (Tjong Kim Sang and Buchholz, 2000), Chinese POS tagging, and three of SIGHAN-3 word segmentation tasks.

First the classifier parameters, feature set should be improved. To achieve this, 1/4 of the training data was used as development set, while the remaining 3/4 training data was used to train the classifier.

Then the predicted labels were included as features to train the final-stage classifier. The final classifier is still our CMM. Third, the postprocessing method (Low et al., 2005) is employed to enhance the unknown word segmentation. Table 4 lists the empirical results of the development set. By validate with development data, we found that C=1.25 and use the E-BIES representation method (Wu et al., 2008) yields better accuracy than B-BIES (Zhou and Kit, 2007). Meanwhile, CRF seems to be suitable for BBIES representation method. The classifier parameters were fixed and then we try to search the optimal feature set via the incremental add-and-check method.

The IOE2 is used to represent the phrase structure and tagged the data with backward direction. The training and testing data of the Chinese POS tagging is mainly derived from the Academic SinicaÂ¶s balanced corpus (version 3.0). Seventy-five percent out of the data is used for training while the remaining 25% is used for testing. However, the task of the Chinese POS tagging is very different from classical English POS tagging in that there is no word boundary information in Chinese text. To achieve this, Ng and Low (2004) gave a successful study on Chinese POS tagging. Just as English phrase chunking, the IOB-tags can be used to represent the Chinese word and its part-of-speech tag. For example, the tag B-ADJ means the first character of a Chinese word which POS tag is ADJ (adjective). n this task, we simply use the IOB2 to represent the chunk structure. In this way, the tagger needs to recognize the chunk tag by considering 118 (59*2) categories at once. As discussed in (Zhou and Kit, 2007), using more complex chunk representation bring better segmentation accuracy in several Chinese word segmentation benchma</context>

To give a fair comparison, we compare our method to CRF with three additional tasks, namely, CoNLL-2000 chunking, SIGHAN-3 Chinese word segmentation. The results were encourage and indicated that the proposed CMM produces better not only accuracy but also training time efficiency. The official results in SIGHAN-2010 also demonstrates that our method perform very well in traditional Chinese with fine-tuned features set. 1 Introduction Since 2006 Chinese word segmentation bakeoff in SIGHAN-3 (Levow, 2006), this is the third time to join the competition (Wu et al., 2006, 2007). In this year, we join the SIGHAN bakeoff task in both traditional and simplified Chinese closed word segmentation. Unlike most western languages, there is no explicit space between words. The goal of word segmentation is to identify words given the sentence. This technique provides important features for downstream purposes. Examples include Chinese part-of-speech (POS) tagging (Wu et al., 2007), Chinese word dependency parsing (Wu et al., 2007, 2008).

These methods condition on local context features and incorporate fix-length history information. Although higher order feature (longer history) maybe useful to some tasks, the exponential scaled inference time is also intractable in practice. Support vector machines (SVMs) which is one of the state-of-the-art supervised learning algorithms have been widely employed as local classifiers to many sequential labeling tasks (Taku and Matsumoto, 2001; Wu et al., 2006, 2008). Specially, the training time of linear kernel SVM with either L1-norm (Joachims, 2006; Keerthi et al., 2008) or L2-norm (Keerthi and DeCoste, 2005; Hsieh et al., 2008) can now be obtained in linear time. Even local classifier-based approaches have the drawbacks of label-bias problems, training nonstructural linear SVM is scalable to large-scale data. By means of so-called one-versus-all multiclass SVM training, it is also scalable to large-category data.

In this paper, we present our Chinese word segmentation based on the proposed conditional support vector Markov models for sequential labeling tasks, especially Chinese word segmentation. Unlike structural learning algorithms, our method can be simply trained without considering the entire structures and hence the training time scales linearly with the number of training examples. In this framework, to alleviate the ease of label-bias problems, the state transition probability is ignored. Instead, we merely utilize the property of label relationships between chunks (Wu et al., 2008). To demonstrate our method, we compare to several well-known structural learning algorithms, like CRF (Kudo et al., 2004), and SVM-HMM (Joachims et al., 2009) on two well-known data, namely, CoNLL-2000 syntactic chunking, SIGHAN-3 Chinese word segmentation tasks. By following this, we apply the model to the Chinese word segmentation tasks of SIGHAN-2010 this year.

To give a fair comparison, we compare our method to CRF with three additional tasks, namely, CoNLL-2000 chunking, SIGHAN-3 Chinese word segmentation. The results were encourage and indicated that the proposed CMM produces better not only accuracy but also training time efficiency. The official results in SIGHAN-2010 also demonstrates that our method perform very well in traditional Chinese with fine-tuned features set. 1 Introduction Since 2006 Chinese word segmentation bakeoff in SIGHAN-3 (Levow, 2006), this is the third time to join the competition (Wu et al., 2006, 2007). In this year, we join the SIGHAN bakeoff task in both traditional and simplified Chinese closed word segmentation. Unlike most western languages, there is no explicit space between words. The goal of word segmentation is to identify words given the sentence. This technique provides important features for downstream purposes. Examples include Chinese part-of-speech (POS) tagging (Wu et al., 2007), Chinese word dependency parsing (Wu et al., 2007, 2008). With the rapid growth of structural learning algorithms, such as conditional random fields (CRFs) (Lafferty et al., 2001) and maximumm</context>

These methods condition on local context features and incorporate fix-length history information. Although higher order feature (longer history) maybe useful to some tasks, the exponential scaled inference time is also intractable in practice. Support vector machines (SVMs) which is one of the state-of-the-art supervised learning algorithms have been widely employed as local classifiers to many sequential labeling tasks (Taku and Matsumoto, 2001; Wu et al., 2006, 2008). Specially, the training time of linear kernel SVM with either L1-norm (Joachims, 2006; Keerthi et al., 2008) or L2-norm (Keerthi and DeCoste, 2005; Hsieh et al., 2008) can now be obtained in linear time. Even local classifier-based approaches have the drawbacks of label-bias problems, training nonstructural linear SVM is scalable to large-scale data. By means of so-called one-versus-all multiclass SVM training, it is also scalable to large-category data.

In this paper, we present our Chinese word segmentation based on the proposed conditional support vector Markov models for sequential labeling tasks, especially Chinese word segmentation. Unlike structural learning algorithms, our method can be simply trained without considering the entire structures and hence the training time scales linearly with the number of training examples. In this framework, to alleviate the ease of label-bias problems, the state transition probability is ignored. Instead, we merely utilize the property of label relationships between chunks (Wu et al., 2008). To demonstrate our method, we compare to several well-known structural learning algorithms, like CRF (Kudo et al., 2004), and SVM-HMM (Joachims et al., 2009) on two well-known data, namely, CoNLL-2000 syntactic chunking, SIGHAN-3 Chinese word segmentation tasks. By following this, we apply the model to the Chinese word segmentation tasks of SIGHAN-2010 this year. The empirical results showed that our method is not only fast but also achieving more superior accuracy than structural learning methods. In traditional Chinese, our method also achieves the state-of-the-art performance in accuracy </context>

The training data was derived from Treebank WSJ section 15-18 while section 20 was used for testing. The goal is to find the non-recursive phrase structures in a sentence, such as noun phrase (NP), verb phrase (VP), etc. There are 11 phrase types in this dataset. We follow the previous best settings for SVMs (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2001; Wu et al., 2008). The IOE2 is used to represent the phrase structure and tagged the data with backward direction.

Instead, a chunkrelation pair is used. Nevertheless, one important property to sequential chunk labeling is that there is only one phrase type in a chunk. For example, if the previous word is tagged as begin of noun phrase (B-NP), the current word must not be end of the other phrase (E-VP, E-PP, etc). Therefore, we only model relationships between chunk tags to generate valid phrase structure. Wu et al. (2007, 2008) presented an automatic chunk pair relation construction algorithm which can handle so-called IOB1/IOB2/IOE1/IOE2 (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2001) chunk representation structures with either left-to-right or right-toleft directions. Here, we extend this idea and generalize to fit to more chunk tags. That is we can model the S-tag, B2, B3 tags with dividing the leading tags into two categories. For details can refer the literatures. 3 Empirical Results Three large-scale and large-category dataset is used to evaluate the proposed method, namely, CoNLL-2000 syntactic chunking (Tjong Kim Sang and</context>
