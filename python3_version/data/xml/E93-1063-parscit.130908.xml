1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999570923076923">
The main aim of the ET-10/75 project, &apos;Collocations
and the Lexicalisation of Semantic Operations&apos;&apos;, is
to evaluate the use of Mel&apos;euk&apos;s analysis of colloca-
tions in terms of lexical functions2, as an interlin-
gua device in a machine translation system. In this
poster we only point out the main design issues in-
volved in encoding the essential parts of this analysis
in an HPSG-style framework. Other aspects of the
project, such as the definition of collocations, or the
evaluation of the analysis as such, will not be dealt
with. The linguistic analysis of collocations (as far
as it is dealt with in this poster) involves two major
issues.

2 Analysis
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9985174">
Examples of the collocational structures we have in
mind are strong criticism (as an adjective-noun com-
bination) and give a demonstration (as a verb-noun
combination). The essential characteristics we want
to account for in our analysis are the following.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9397476">
• The collocational cooccurrence restriction.
• The dependence of the meaning of the collocate
on the combination.
• The relation between the &apos;collocate occurrence&apos;
of a word and its free occurrence.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999857">
Following Mel&apos;euk, the restricted choice of the par-
ticular adjective or verb is represented in the dictio-
nary by means of lexical functions. The dictionary
entry for criticism contains a section in which its &apos;col-
locates&apos; are listed, indexed by a lexical function. In
this case, we would find: Magn(criticism) = strong.
This points out that you can use strong when you
want to express Magn(criticism). In our interpre-
tation of these lexical functions, we take them to be
general semantic operations, representing the major
semantic contribution of the collocate. So we say
that strong means Magn (= very, intense ...) in the
context of criticism.
As far as translation is concerned, we no longer
need a transfer rule mapping &apos;strong criticism&apos; on

`scherpe kritiek&apos; (lit, sharp criticism) because if both
are analyzed as the interlingual Magn, we can leave
the correct choice of adjective to the monolingual
components.
The HPSG grammars we are using, closely resem-
ble the proposals in [Pollard and Sag, 1987]. As far
as the coding of the lexical functions is concerned,
we have simply interpreted these as relation names.

3 Representation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.869581578947369">
Besides the use of a Mel&apos;eukian analysis and the
choice of an HPSG-style grammar, one of the design
criteria that has guided the representation is to be
&apos;minimally redundant&apos;. This has led to the following
solution.
• The collocate is only specified by a partial lex-
ical entry, which is a generalization of its &apos;free-
occurring&apos; counterpart (its meaning is left un-
specified, for instance).
• In the lexicon, it is specified on the base which
collocates it selects for a particular lexical func-
tion. The remainder of the collocation specific
information about the collocate is specified here
as well.
The following is part of the entry for criticism to
illustrate the latter issue. The COL field provides
the information that to express Magn(criticism), it
can combine with strong. The reference $strong is
to the collocate entry in the dictionary.
