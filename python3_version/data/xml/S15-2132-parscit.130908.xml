This paper describes the outcomes of the
TimeLine task (Cross-Document Event Order-
ing), that was organised within the Time and
Space track of SemEval-2015. Given a set of
documents and a set of target entities, the task
consisted of building a timeline for each en-
tity, by detecting, anchoring in time and or-
dering the events involving that entity. The
TimeLine task goes a step further than previ-
ous evaluation challenges by requiring partic-
ipant systems to perform both event corefer-
ence and temporal relation extraction across
documents. Four teams submitted the output
of their systems to the four proposed subtracks
for a total of 13 runs, the best of which ob-
tained an Fl-score of 7.85 in the main track
(timeline creation from raw text).

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.9999811875">
In any domain, it is important that professionals have
access to high quality knowledge for taking well-
informed decisions. As daily tasks of information
professionals revolve around reconstructing a chain
of previous events, an insightful way of presenting
information to them is by means of timelines. The
aim of the Cross-Document Event Ordering task is
to build timelines from English news articles. To
provide focus to the timeline creation, the task is pre-
sented as an ordering task in which events involving
a particular target entity are to be ordered chrono-
logically. The task focuses on cross-document event
coreference resolution and cross-document temporal
relation extraction.
The latter has been the topic of the three previous
TempEval tasks within the SemEval challenges:

Additionally, it has also been the focus of the 6th
i2b2 NLP Challenge for clinical records (Sun et al.,
2013). The cross-document aspect, however, has not
often been explored. One example is the work de-
scribed in (Ji et al., 2009) using the ACE 2005 train-
ing corpora. Here the authors link pre-defined events
involving the same centroid entities (i.e. entities fre-
quently participating in events) on a timeline. Nom-
inal coreference resolution has been the topic of Se-
mEval 2010 Task on Coreference Resolution in Mul-
tiple Languages (Recasens et al., 2010). TimeLine
is a pilot task that goes beyond the above-mentioned
evaluation exercises by addressing coreference reso-
lution for events and temporal relation extraction at
a cross document level.
This task was motivated by work done in the
NewsReader project1. The goal of the NewsReader
project is to reconstruct story lines across news ar-
ticles in order to provide policy and decision mak-
ers with an overview of what happened, to whom,
when, and where. Thus, the NewsReader project
aims to present end-users with cross-document sto-
rylines. Timelines are intermediate event represen-

2 Task Description
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999742709677419">
Given a set of documents and a set of target enti-
ties, the task consists of building a timeline related
to each entity, i.e. detecting, anchoring in time, and
ordering the events in which the target entity is in-
volved (Minard et al., 2014b). We base our no-
tion of event on TimeML, according to which an
event is a cover term for situations that happen or
occur, including predicates describing states or cir-
cumstances in which something obtains or holds true
(Pustejovsky et al., 2003).
As input data, we provide a set of documents and
a set of target entities; only entities involved in more
than two events across at least two different docu-
ments are considered as candidates target entities.
We also propose two different tracks on the basis
of the data used as input: Track A, for which we
provided only the raw text sources (main track), and
Track B, for which we also made gold event men-
tions available.
The expected output, both for Track A and B, is
one timeline for each target entity. A timeline for a
specific target entity consists of the ordered list of
the events in which that entity participates. Events
in a timeline are anchored in time through the time
anchor attribute; however, for both Track A and B,
we also propose a subtrack in which the events do
not need to be associated to a time anchor.
In Figure 1 we show an example of a timeline for
the target entity Steve Jobs built using five sentences
extracted from three documents. In bold we repre-
sent the events that form the timeline.

<bodyText confidence="0.998691571428571">
In order to perform the task, participants are
required to resolve entity coreference, as time-
lines should contain events involving all corefer-
ring textual mentions of the target entities (including
pronominal mentions). For example, in Figure 1, the
event fighting involving the target entity Steve Jobs
mentioned as he is included in the timeline together
with other events also referring to Steve Jobs.
The dataset released for this task is composed of
120 Wikinews2 articles and 44 target entities. 30
documents and 6 target entities (each associated to a
timeline) are provided as trial data, while the evalu-
ation dataset consist of 90 documents and 38 target
entities (each associated to a timeline).
</bodyText>

3 Data Annotation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9888">
We manually selected a set of target entities that ap-
peared in at least two different documents and were
involved in more than two events.
The target entities are restricted to type PERSON
(single persons or sets of people), ORGANISATION
(corporations, agencies, and other groups of people
defined by an established organisational structure),
PRODUCT (anything that might satisfy a want or
need, including facilities, food, products, services,
etc.), and FINANCIAL (the entities belonging to the
financial domain that are not included in one of the
other entity types).
Some examples of target entities are Steve Jobs
(PERSON), Apple Inc. (ORGANISATION), Airbus
A380 (PRODUCT), and Nasdaq (FINANCIAL).
The annotation procedure for the creation of gold
standard timelines for the target entities required one
person month. It consisted of four steps, as de-
scribed below.
Entity annotation. All occurrences of the target
entities in the four corpora were marked following
(Tonelli et al., 2014). Cross-document co-reference
was annotated according to the NewsReader cross-
document annotation guidelines (Speranza and Mi-
nard, 2014). For this task, we used CROMER3 (Gi-
rardi et al., 2014), a tool designed specifically for
cross-document annotation.

<bodyText confidence="0.998215291666666">
Event and time anchor annotation. Using
CROMER, the corpora were annotated with events
following the NewsReader cross-document annota-
tion guidelines (Speranza and Minard, 2014). The
annotation of events as defined in (Tonelli et al.,
2014) was restricted by limiting the annotation to
events that could be placed on a timeline. Thus, we
did not annotate adjectival events, cognitive events,
counter-factual events (which certainly did not hap-
pen), uncertain events (which might or might not
have happened) and grammatical events4. For ex-
ample, the events gave, chosen and been (on medi-
cal leave) in Figure 1 are excluded from the timeline
as they are grammatical events.
Furthermore, timelines only contain events in
which target entities explicitly participate in a
has participant relation as defined in (Tonelli et al.,
2014), with the semantic role ARG0 (i.e. agent)
or ARG1 (i.e. patient), as defined in the PropBank
Guidelines (Bonial et al., 2010). In the example in
Figure 1 we have an explicit has participant relation
between the entity Steve Jobs and the event fighting
with semantic role ARG0, and one with semantic
role ARG1 between Steve Jobs and described.
Based on TimeML (Pustejovsky et al., 2003),
a time anchor corresponds to a TIMEX3 of type
DATE; the time anchor attribute of an event takes
as value the point in time when the event occurred
(in the case of punctual events) or began (in the case
of durative events). Its format follows the ISO-8601
standard: YYYY-MM-DD (i.e. Year, Month, and
Day).
The finest granularity for time anchor values
is DAY; other granularities admitted are MONTH
and YEAR (references to months are specified as
YYYY-MM and references to years are expressed
as YYYY). The place-holder character, X, is used
for unfilled positions in the value of a component.
Thus, an event happened some day (not specified
in the text) in July 2010 (for example, resigned in
The company’s CEO met his employees one morn-
ing last July) has time anchor 2010-07-XX (granu-
4Grammatical events are verbs or nouns that are semanti-
cally dependent on a governing content verb/noun. Typical ex-
amples of grammatical events are copula verbs, light verbs fol-
lowed by a nominal event, aspectual verbs and nouns, verbs and
nouns expressing causal and motivational relations, and verbs
and nouns expressing occurrence.

larity DAY), while an event happened in the same
month but with a granularity lower than day (for
example in Apple received criticism last month for
the placement of the antenna on iPhone 4), has
time anchor 2010-07. Similarly, XXXX-XX-XX is
used when the time anchor is completely unknown
and the granularity is DAY, while XXXX-XX and
XXXX are used when the time anchor is unknown
and the granularity is MONTH and YEAR respec-
tively (Minard et al., 2014a).
Automatic creation of timelines. We represent
timelines in a simple tab format. On each line, we
first have a cardinal number indicating the position
of an event in the timeline, then the value of the an-
chor time attribute for the same event, and finally the
event itself, which is represented as follows: docu-
ment identifier, sentence number and textual extent
of the event. For example, the event 18315-7-leave
in Figure 1 (occurring in sentence 7 of document
18315) occupies position 4 in the timeline and is an-
chored to 2011-01.
In the case of event coreference, in the third col-
umn, there is a list of coreferring events separated
by tabs instead of a single event (see the coreferring
events 18315-7-fighting and 18355-4-fighting at po-
sition 1 in the example in Figure 1).
If two events have the same value for the anchor
time attribute, they are placed in the same position
(i.e. the same number in the first column), but on
different lines.
The automatic created timelines are produced by a
script that orders events in a timeline on the basis of
the time anchors (all events with the same time an-
chor are simultaneous and all events with unknown
time anchor are at position 0).
Manual revision of the timelines. The manual re-
vision consists of ordering events with the same time
anchor or with unknown time anchor taking into
consideration textual information that goes beyond
the defining of time anchor (Minard et al., 2014a).
For example both founded and closed in The firm
was founded in 2010 and closed before the end of the
year have anchor time 2010; nonetheless, based on
textual information, it is possible to order them (the
firm first was founded and then closed). When it is
not possible to order events based either on the time
anchor or on textual information, annotators leave
them at the same position on the timeline. The same
holds for events with anchor time XXXX-XX-XX; if
annotators have no textual information that can help
ordering them, they leave them at position 0; other-
wise they place them on the timeline.
Inter-annotator agreement Three annotators
have annotated a corpus starting from one target
entity, i.e. they have annotated entity coreferences
refering to the target entity and the events in which
this entity participates. The corpus used is the trial
corpus about Apple Inc. and the target entity iPhone
4. We compute the inter-annotator agreement
using the Dice’s coefficient (Dice, 1945). For
the annotation of entity and event mentions, the
agreement is respectively 0.81 and 0.66, and for
entity coreferences of 0.84.

The dataset used for this task is composed of arti-
cles from Wikinews, a collection of multilingual on-
line news articles written collaboratively in a wiki-

source is its creative commons license allowing us to
freely release this dataset to the research community.
For this task, we selected Wikinews articles around
four topics:

The trial data consists of one corpus of 30 docu-
ments and gold standard timelines for six target en-
tities. The other three corpora, each consisting of 30
documents (about 30,000 tokens each) were used as
the evaluation dataset.
As reported in Table 1, the total number of target
entities in the evaluation dataset amounts to 38, but
for the evaluation we used 37 timelines instead as
one of the timelines contained no events.
The trial data contains one target entity of type
ORGANISATION, one of type PERSON and 4 of
type PRODUCT. The distribution of target entity

The three evaluation corpora are very similar in
terms of size. It is interesting to notice, however, that
the timelines created from the Stock Market corpus
have peculiar features as they contain a lower aver-
age number of events with respect to those created
from the other corpora. On the other hand, on av-
erage, Stock Market timelines contain events from a
higher number of different documents, i.e. 9.1, ver-

5 Evaluation Methodology
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9990858">
The evaluation methodology of this task is based on
the evaluation metric used for TempEval-3 (UzZa-
man et al., 2013) to evaluate relations in terms of
recall, precision and Fl-score. The metric captures
the temporal awareness of an annotation (UzZaman
and Allen, 2011).
Temporal awareness is defined as the
performance of an annotation as identi-
fying and categorizing temporal relations,
which implies the correct recognition and
classification of the temporal entities in-
volved in the relations.
We calculate the Precision by check-
ing the number of reduced system rela-
tions that can be verified from the refer-
ence annotation temporal closure graph,
out of number of temporal relations in the
reduced system relations. Similarly, we
calculate the Recall by checking the num-
ber of reduced reference annotation rela-

tions that can be verified from the sys-
tem output’s temporal closure graph, out
of number of temporal relations in the re-
duced reference annotation. (UzZaman et
al., 2013)
Before evaluating temporal awareness, each time-
line needs to be transformed into a set of temporal
relations. Figure 2 shows the explicit relations re-
sulting from the timeline of Figure 1 as well as the
implicit relations captured by the temporal graph. In
order to convert each timeline, we defined the fol-
lowing transformation steps:

Note that the evaluation of subtracks (ordering
only), requires steps 3 and 4 alone.
For this first pilot on timelines, we decided to
simplify the representation of durative events in the
timelines by anchoring them in time considering
their starting point. For this reason we represent re-
lations between each event and its time anchor with
the SIMULTANEOUS relation type (instead of other
possibilities like BEGUN BY or INCLUDES).
Events placed at the beginning of the timeline at
position 0, i.e. events that were not ordered, are
not considered in the evaluation. The official scores
are based on the micro-average of the individual F1-
scores for each timeline, i.e. the scores are averaged
over the events of the timelines of each corpus. The
micro-average precision and recall values are also
provided.

29 teams signed up for the evaluation task, 8 teams
downloaded the evaluation dataset and only 4 teams
submitted results. A total of 13 unique runs were
submitted: 3 for Track A (for which the participants
worked on the raw texts), 2 for SubTrack A, 4 for
Track B (for which the event mentions were pro-

The WHUNLP team processed the texts with Stan-

In the main track, Track A, WHUNLP 1 was the
best run and achieved an F1 of 7.28%. In Track B,
GPLSIUA 1 obtained the best scores with an F1 of

The subtracks were proposed in order to evaluate
systems that do not perform time normalisation or
event anchoring in time but focus on temporal re-

the same as those submitted to the main tracks. In
SubTrack A the best results are obtained with the
run 1 of SPINOZAVU team, achieving an F1-score
of 1.69%. In SubTrack B, the best system is the
same as in Track B, GPLSIUA 1, with an F1-score

We evaluate the selection of the relevant events
involving a target entity using the classic evaluation

are taken into account independently of their order-
ing in timelines; events placed at position 0 are also
evaluated. The number of true positives and F1-

average F1-scores are presented in Table 3. In Ta-

(Track B). Furthermore, the task of time expression
extraction and normalisation has been the topic of
different shared tasks and the obtained results are
high with an Fl-score of 90.30 for time expres-
sion detection and of 77.61 for normalisation (re-
sults obtained by HeidelTime (Str¨otgen et al., 2013)
at TempEval-3). However, the performance of tem-
poral relation extraction systems is quite low with an
Fl-score of 36.26 obtained by ClearTK-2 (Bethard,
2013), the best system at TempEval-3 on Task C.
Observing the results by corpus in Table 2, we
notice that, except for Track A, the best results are
obtained on the “Stock Market” corpus. One of the
reasons is that in the timelines related to this corpus
all events were ordered (only one event was placed
at position 0), while in “Airbus” and “GM” corpora
less than 70% of the events were ordered.
In the “GM” corpus, one timeline was empty
(“General Motors creditors”), i.e. the corpus does
not contain any event that have this target entity
as Arg0 or Arg1, therefore this timeline was re-
moved from the evaluation. We observed that
SPINOZAVU systems in Track A and GPLSIUA sys-
tems in Track B correctly returned an empty time-
line, while WHUNLP created a timeline with 3
events in Track A and HEIDELTOUL 1 and HEIDEL-
TOUL 2 produced a timeline containing respectively
32 and 78 events for this target entity in Track B.
Track B was proposed as a simplified task given
that annotated texts with events were distributed to
participants. Unfortunately no results from the same
system run on both Tracks A and B were submitted,
therefore, at the moment, we cannot evaluate the im-
pact of pre-annotation of events.

8 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999883052631579">
The TimeLine task is the first task focusing on cross-
document ordering of events. For this task, we have
defined guidelines for cross-document annotation
and for timeline creation, as well as annotated trial
and evaluation datasets. The results submitted by
four teams show much room for improvement. Ob-
viously, timeline creation is a very challenging task
which deserves more attention in future research.
Additionally, during the organisation of this task,
many issues arose that provide interesting avenues
of future research into timeline creation. Our three
main issues concern durative versus punctual events,
events without explicit time anchors and the relation
between target entities and events. Below, we detail
each of these questions.
Anchoring events in time. The ordering of an
event in a timeline is based on the time when the
event occurred. However, many events are durative
events that have a starting point and/or an ending
point. For the task, we decided to order durative
events according to their starting points. We are in-
vestigating whether a new timeline format can be de-
fined to represent the durative aspect of these events.
Events without explicit textual time anchor. We
made the choice to include them in the timelines but
not to evaluate them (events at position 0). The dif-
ficulty is to identify cases in which an event cannot
be ordered in order to give instruction to annotators
and systems. When ordering an event, should we
take into consideration the information contained in-
side one document or inside one corpus, or could
(should) we consider also background knowledge?
The relation between target entities and events.
We chose to select events in which one target en-
tity is explicitly involved in a participant relation.
Amongst others, this rule excludes events involving
a group of which a target entity is member. For
example the event received in The two companies
have received $13.4 billion (in which the two com-
panies refers to General Motors and Chrysler) does
not appear either in the “General Motors” timeline
or in the “Chrysler” timeline. Considering also im-
plicit has participant relations would take the time-
line task into the domain of complex entity relation-
ships, but could possibly be interesting if considered
in combination with taxonomy induction tasks.
With this TimeLine task, we aimed to take a
step forward in the current state-of-the-art in cross-
document coreference and temporal relation extrac-
tion. As organisers, we needed to come up with new
ways of annotating and representing data. For the
participating teams, the task meant that they needed
to combine cutting-edge NLP technologies. This pi-
lot task has shown us that the goal of automatic time-
line extraction from raw text is challenging, but it
has given us many more insights into what is possi-
ble, and what issues still need to be addressed.

Given a set of documents and a set of target entities, the task consisted of building a timeline for each entity, by detecting, anchoring in time and ordering the events involving that entity. The TimeLine task goes a step further than previous evaluation challenges by requiring participant systems to perform both event coreference and temporal relation extraction across documents. Four teams submitted the output of their systems to the four proposed subtracks for a total of 13 runs, the best of which oban of 7.85 in the main track (timeline creation from raw text).</abstract>

Furthermore, timelines only contain events in which target entities explicitly participate in a has participant relation as defined in (Tonelli et al., 2014), with the semantic role ARG0 (i.e. agent) or ARG1 (i.e. patient), as defined in the PropBank Guidelines (Bonial et al., 2010).

The corpus used is the trial corpus about Apple Inc. and the target entity iPhone 4. We compute the inter-annotator agreement using the Dice’s coefficient (Dice, 1945).
