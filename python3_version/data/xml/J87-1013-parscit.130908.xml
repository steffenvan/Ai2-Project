Seuren&apos;s book can be useful and interesting for two
different kinds of readers: firstly, for those specialists
who are interested simply in problems suggested by the
title itself, and secondly, for students and other people
who are novices in the field of theoretical linguistics and
want to reach its central points going a very difficult but
also very fascinating way. This second &amp;quot;usefulness&amp;quot;
seems to be not so obvious as the first one; probably it
has not even been intended by the author. However, we
should start this review by emphasizing and lauding this
feature of the book in question.
Pieter Seuren does not try to build his theory without
having laid the foundations of it. He places his ideas in a
long tradition of linguistic thought and proposes his
answers to some essential questions relating to language
and linguistics. He considers the main goal of the study
of language to be &amp;quot;an insight into the cognitive machin-
ery which enables humans to use it the way they do&amp;quot; and
describes and criticizes the current situation in the theory
of meaning and grammar with its principal fault being the
insufficiency of linguistic facts to support abstract, formal
systems. Seuren resumes the ancient controversy
between the anomalists and the analogists and places his
book in the former tradition.
These, and many other basic theoretical statements
make this book partially open but not easy! for non-spe-
cialists who wish to familiarize themselves with some
topics of modern linguistic thought.
However, the main purpose of this book is to repre-
sent Seuren&apos;s ideas concerning semantics, especially
describing the meaning of sentences from the point of
view of their role in a discourse. Seuren is of the opinion
that the meaning of a sentence cannot be described in
isolation. The central notion of the book is thus
&amp;quot;discourse domain&amp;quot;, which is defined as a finite number
of distinct addresses, superaddresses, and instructions.
An address is a store to which every new asserted
sentence in the discourse contributes new information
about the individual referred to by the discourse. A
superaddress differs from the address in that it refers not
to individuals but to sets of individuals.
In Seuren&apos;s estimation, the meaning of a sentence
consists in &amp;quot;the systematic modification, or increment,
which it brings about whenever it is added to an appro-
priate given discourse domain&amp;quot;.
These basic definitions are contained in the first chap-
ter which is entitled &amp;quot;Discourse and interpretation&amp;quot;.
They are implemented in other parts of the book, espe-
cially in chapters 4 and 5.
In chapter 2, &amp;quot;Grammar and lexicon&amp;quot;, Seuren arraigns
the idea of surface semantics and represents his version
of traditional SA-semantics, which is based on the
assumption that surface structures are not directly inter-
pretable and, therefore, a separate level of semantic anal-
ysis is needed.
Chapter 3, &amp;quot;The logic and semantics of
presupposition&amp;quot;, gives us, among other things, the idea of
presuppositional three-valued logic which is also devel-
oped in the appendix by A. Weijters.
The book in question contains many fragments which
are really exciting. It gives a large and original picture of
one of the most important topics in modern linguistics.

The two books under review here have much in commow
not only do they both deal with the question of compre-
hension of narratives in general, but they also share the
view that this can be achieved via understanding of the
goals of the participants involved. This coincidence
perhaps stems from the shared background of the two
authors, namely the Yale-based work of Schank, Abel-
son, and others, to which both authors make reference, in
some instances extensively. In case this revelation should
lead some readers to prejudge the works immediately, it
must be said that the Schankian influence is less evident
in Wilensky&apos;s book than in Dyer&apos;s.
