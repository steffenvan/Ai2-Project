<bodyText confidence="0.999827363636364">
In incremental spoken dialogue systems, par-
tial hypotheses about what was said are re-
quired even while the utterance is still ongo-
ing. We define measures for evaluating the
quality of incremental ASR components with
respect to the relative correctness of the par-
tial hypotheses compared to hypotheses that
can optimize over the complete input, the tim-
ing of hypothesis formation relative to the por-
tion of the input they are about, and hypothesis
stability, defined as the number of times they
are revised. We show that simple incremen-
tal post-processing can improve stability dra-
matically, at the cost of timeliness (from 90 %
of edits of hypotheses being spurious down to
10 % at a lag of 320 ms). The measures are
not independent, and we show how system de-
signers can find a desired operating point for
their ASR. To our knowledge, we are the first
to suggest and examine a variety of measures
for assessing incremental ASR and improve
performance on this basis.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999879644444445">
Incrementality, that is, the property of beginning to
process input before it is complete, is often seen as a
desirable property of dialogue systems (e.g., Allen
et al. (2001)), as it allows the system to (a) fold
processing time (of modules such as parsers, or di-
alogue managers) into the time taken by the utter-
ance, and (b) react to partial results, for example by
generating back-channel utterances or speculatively
initiating potentially relevant database queries.
Input to a spoken dialogue system normally
passes an automatic speech recognizer (ASR) as a
first processing module, thus the module’s incre-
mentality determines the level of incrementality that
can be reached by the system as a whole. Using
an ASR system incrementally poses interesting chal-
lenges, however. Typically, ASRs use dynamic pro-
gramming and the maximum likelihood hypothesis
to find the word sequence with the lowest expected
likelihood of the sequence containing errors (sen-
tence error). Due to the dynamic programming ap-
proach, what is considered the best hypothesis about
a given stretch of the input signal can change during
the recognition process, as more right context which
can be used as evidence becomes available.
In this paper, we argue that normally used met-
rics for ASR evaluation such as word error rate must
be complemented with metrics specifically designed
for measuring incremental performance, and offer
some such metrics. We show that there are various
subproperties that are not independent of each other,
and that trade-offs are involved if either of those is
to be optimized. Finally, we propose ways to im-
prove incremental performance (as measured by our
metrics) through the use of smoothing techniques.
To our knowledge, incremental evaluation met-
rics of ASR for incremental systems have not yet
been covered in the literature. Most closely related,
Wachsmuth et al. (1998) show results for an ASR
which fixes its results after a given time Δ and re-
port the corresponding word error rate (WER). This
unfortunately confounds the incremental and non-
incremental properties of their ASR’s performance.
The remainder of this paper is structured as fol-
lows: In section 2, we give an overview of increme-
nality with respect to ASR, and develop our evalua-

2 Incrementality and Evaluation Measures
for Incremental ASR
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999979653846154">
In a modular system, an incremental module is one
that generates (partial) responses while input is still
ongoing and makes these available to other mod-
ules (Kilger and Finkler, 1995). ASR modules that
use token passing (Young et al., 1989) can easily
be adapted to output a new, live hypothesis after
processing of every input frame (often that is ev-
ery 10 ms). In an incremental system we are able
to get partial results from these hypotheses as soon
as they become available – or rather as soon as they
can be trusted. As mentioned above, hypotheses are
only tentative, and may be revised when more right
context becomes available. Modules consuming the
output of an incremental ASR hence must be able
to deal with such revisions. There is a first trade-off
here: Depending on how costly revision is for later
modules (which after all may need to revise any hy-
potheses which they themselves based on the now-
revised input), it may be better to reduce the incre-
mentality a bit – in the sense that partial informa-
tion is produced less often, and hence new words for
example are recognised later – if that buys stability
(fewer revisions). Also, ignoring some incremen-
tal results that are likely to be wrong may increase
system performance. Defining these notions more
precisely is the aim of this section.

1In this paper, we only deal with one-best ASR. We believe
that there are no principled differences when generalising to n-

We also abstract away from changes in the hypothesised start
and end times of the words in the sequence. It often happens that

(Note that this is an artificial example, showing only
a few illustratory and interesting hypotheses. In a
real recognition system, the hypothesis frequency is
of course much higher, with much repetition of sim-
ilar hypotheses at consecutive frames.)
The question now is how we can evaluate the
quality of a hypothesis at the time t it is produced.
It is reasonable to only expect this hypothesis to say
something (correct or not) about the input up to time
t – unless we want the ASR to predict, in which case
we want it to make assumptions about times beyond
t (see section 4.1). There are two candidates for the
yardstick against which the partial hypotheses could
be compared: First, one could take the actually spo-
ken words, computing measures such as word error
rate. The other option, which is the one taken here,
is to take as the gold standard the final hypothesis
produced by the ASR when it has all evidence avail-
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.948797">
the ASR’s assumptions about the position of the word bound-
aries change, even if the word sequence stays constant. If, as we
assume here, later modules do not use this timing information,
we can consider two hypotheses that only differ in boundary
placement as identical.
</footnote>

able (i.e., when the utterance is complete). This is
more meaningful for our purpose, as it relates the in-
formativity of the partial hypothesis to what can be
expected if the ASR can do all its internal optimisa-
tions, and not to the factually correct sequence that
the ASR might not be able to recognise even with
all information present. This latter problem is al-
ready captured in the conventional non-incremental
performance measures.
In our metrics in this paper, we hence take as gold
standard (wgold) the final, non-incremental hypothe-
sis of the ASR (which, to reiterate this point, might
be factually incorrect, that is, might contain word
errors). We define a module’s incremental response
at time t (whypt) as relatively correct (r-correct), iff
it is equal to the non-incremental hypothesis up to
time t: whyptt = wgoldt. Hence, in figure 1 above,
hypotheses 1, 2, 6, 7, 9 and 12 are r-correct.2 We
call the normalised rate of r-correct responses of a
module its (average) r-correctness.
As defined above, the criterion for r-correctness
is still pretty strict, as it demands of the ASR that
words on the right edge are recognised even from
the first frame on. For example, whyp10 in figure 1
is not r-correct, because wgold10 (that part of wgold
that ends where whyp10 ends) already spans parts of
the word “drei” which has not yet been picked up
by the incremental recognition. A relaxed notion
of correctness hence is prefix-correctness, which re-
quires only that whypt be a prefix of wgoldt. (Hy-
potheses 3 and 10 in figure 1 are p-correct, as are all
r-correct hypotheses.) It should be noted though that
p-correctness is too forgiving to be used directly as
an optimization target: in the example in figure 1,
a module that only ever produces empty hypotheses
would trivally achieve perfect p-correctness (as this
is always a prefix of wgold).

2.2 Edit Overhead
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.980215522727273">
The measures defined so far capture only static as-
pects of the incremental performance of a module
and do not say anything about the dynamics of the
recognition process. To capture this, we look at
the changes between subsequent partial hypotheses.
There are three ways in which an hypothesis hypt+1
2The timing in hypothesis 7 is not correct – but this does not
matter to our notion of correctness (see footnote 1).
can be different from hypt: there can be an extension
of the word sequence, a revokation, or a revision of
the last words in the sequence.3 These differences
can be expressed as edit messages, where extending
a sequence by one word would require an add mes-
sage (®), deleting the last word in the sequence a
revoke message (⊖), and exchange of the last word
would require two messages, one to revoke the old
and one to add the new word.4
Now, an incrementally perfect ASR would only
generate extensions, adding new words at the right
edge; thus, there would be exactly as many edit mes-
sages as there are words in wgold. In reality, there
are typically many more changes, and hence many
spurious edits (see below for characteristic rates in
our data). We call the rate of spurious edits the edit
overhead (EO). For figure 1 above, this is 811: There
are 11 edits (as shown in the figure), while we’d ex-
pect only 3 (one ® for each word in the final result).
Hence, 8 edits are spurious.
This measure corresponds directly to the amount
of unnecessary activity a consumer of the ASR’s
output performs when it reacts swiftly to words that
may be revoked later on. If the consumer is able to
robustly cope with parallel hypotheses (for example
by building a lattice-like structure), a high EO may
not be problematic, but if revisions are costly for
later modules (or even impossible because action has
already been taken), we would like EO to be as low
as possible. This can be achieved by not sending edit
messages unconditionally as soon as words change
in the ASR’s current hypothesis, using strategies as
outlined in section 4. Obviously, deferring or sup-
pressing messages results in delays, a topic to which
we turn in the following section, where we define
measures for the response time of ASR.

2.3 Timing Measures
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998044">
So far, our measures capture characteristics about
the complete recognition process. We now turn to
the timing of the recognition of individual words.
For this, we again take the output of the ASR when
all signal is present (i.e., wgold) as the basis. There

keep things simple, we only regard two atomic operations.
</footnote>

<bodyText confidence="0.999991534482759">
are two things we may be interested in. First, we
may want to know when is the first time that a certain
word appears in the correct position in the sequence
(or equivalently, when its first correct add edit mes-
sage is sent), expressed in relation to its boundaries
in wgold. We measure this event, the first time that
the ASR was right about a word, relative to its gold
beginning. We call the measure word first correct
response (WFC). As a concrete example take hyp7
in figure 1. At this point, the word “zwei” is first hy-
pothesised. Compared to the beginning of the word
in wgold, this point (t7) has a delay of 1 frame (the
frames are illustrated by the dashed lines).
As explained above, it may very well be the
case that for a brief while another hypothesis, not
r-correct w.r.t. wgold, may be favoured (cf. the word
“zwar” in the example in the figure). Another mea-
sure we hence might also be interested in is when our
word hypothesis starts remaining stable or, in other
words, becomes final. We measure this event rela-
tive to the end of the word in the gold standard. We
call it word first final response (WFF). In our exam-
ple, again for “zwei”, this is t9, which has a distance
of 0 to the right boundary of the word in wgold.
In principle, we could use both anchor points (the
left vs. the right edge of a word) for either measure
or use a word-relative scale, but for simplicity’s sake
we restrict ourselves to one anchor point each.
Under normal conditions, we expect WFC to be
positive. The better the incremental ASR, the closer
to 0 it will be. WFC is not a measure we can eas-
ily optimize. We would either have to enumerate
the whole language model or use external non-ASR
knowledge to predict continuations of the word se-
quence before the word in question has started. This
would increase EO. In principle, we are rather in-
terested in accepting an increase in WFC, when we
delay messages in order to decrease EO.
WFF however, can reach values below 0. It
converges towards the negative average of word
length as an incremental ASR improves. For non-
incremental ASR it would be positive: the average
distance beween the sentence end and word end.
WFF is a measure we can strive to reduce by sending
fewer (especially fewer wrong) messages.
Another property we might be interested in opti-
mizing is the time it takes from the first correct hy-
pothesis to stabilize to a final hypothesis. We com-
pute this correction time as the difference in time
between WFF and WFC.5 A correction time of 0 in-
dicates that there was no correction, i.e. the ASR was
immediately correct about a word, something which
we would like to happen as often as possible.
Note that these are measures for each word in
each processed utterance, and we will use distribu-
tional parameters of these timing measures (means
and standard deviations) as metrics for the perfor-
mance of the incremental setups described later.

2.4 Summary of Measures
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999985928571428">
In this section, we first described measures that eval-
uate the overall correctness of incrementally pro-
duced ASR hypotheses, not taking into account their
sequential nature. We then turned to the dynamics of
how the current hypothesis evolves in a way which
we consider important for a consumer of incremen-
tal ASR, namely the overhead that results from edits
to the hypothesis. Finally, we looked at the timing
of individual messages with regard to first correct
(potentially unstable) occurrence (WFC) and stabil-
ity (WFF). In the next section, we use the measures
defined here to characterize the incremental perfor-
mance of our ASR, before we discuss ways to im-
prove incremental performance in section 4.

We use the large-vocabulary continuous-speech
recognition framework Sphinx-4 (Walker et al.,
2004) for our experiments, using the built-in Lex-
Tree decoder, extended by us to provide incremen-
tal results. We built acoustic models for German,
based on a small corpus of spontaneous instructions
in a puzzle building domain,6 and the Kiel corpus
of read speech (IPDS, 1994). We use a trigram lan-
guage model that is based on the puzzle domain tran-
scriptions. As test data we use 85 recordings of two
speakers (unknown to the acoustic model) that speak
sentences similar to those in the puzzle domain.
We do not yet use recognition rescoring to opti-
mize for word error rate, but just the ASR’s best
hypotheses which optimize for low sentence error.

Razik et al. (2008) to optimize ASR performance are
orthogonal to the approaches presented in section 4
and could well be incorporated to further improve
incremental performance.
The individual recordings in our corpus are fairly
short (5.5 seconds on average) and include a bit of si-
lence at the beginning and end. Obviously, recogniz-
ing silence is much easier than recognizing words.
To make our results more meaningful for continuous
speech, we crop away all ASR hypotheses from be-
fore and after the active recognition process.7 While
this reduces our performance in terms of correctness
(we crop away areas with nearly 100 % correctness),
it has no impact on the edit overhead, as the number
of changes in w,,,,, remains unchanged, and also no
impact on the timing measures as all word bound-
aries remain the same.

Table 1 characterises our ASR module (on our data)
in terms of the metrics defined in section 2. Addi-
tionally we state sentence error rate, as the rate of
sentences that contain at least one error, and word
error rate computed in the usual way, as well as
the mean duration of words in our corpus (as non-
incrementally measured for our ASR).
We see that correctness is quite low. This is
mostly due to the jitter that the evolving current hy-
pothesis shows in its last few frames, jumping back
and forth between highly-ranked alternatives. Also,
our ASR only predicts words once there is acoustic
evidence for several phonemes and every phoneme
(being modelled by 3 HMM states) must have a du-
ration of at least 3 frames. Thus, some errors rela-
tive to the final hypothesis occur because the ASR

only hypothesizes about words once they already
have a certain duration (and hence preceding hy-
potheses are not r-correct). The difference between
r-correctness and p-correctness (20 % in our case)
may be largely attributed to this fact.
The edit overhead of 90.5 % means that for ev-
ery neccessary add message, there are nine superflu-
ous (add or revoke) messages. Thus, a consumer of
the ASR output would have to recompute its results
ten times on average. In an incremental system, this
consumer might itself output messages and further
revise decisions as information from other modules
becomes available, leading to a tremendous amount
of changes in the system state. As ASR is the first
module in an incremental spoken dialogue system,
reducing the edit overhead is essential for overall
system performance.
On average, the correct hypothesis about a word
becomes available 276 ms after the word has started
(WFC). With a mean word duration of 378 ms
this means that information becomes available af-
ter roughly 4 of the word have been spoken. No-
tice though that the median is somewhat lower than
the mean, implying that this time is lower for most
words and much higher for some words. In fact, the
maximum for WFC in our data is 1.38 s.
On average, a word becomes final (i.e. is
not changed anymore) when it has ended
(mean(WFF) = 0.004). Again, the median is
lower, indicating the unnormal distribution of WFF
(more often lower, sometimes much higher).

hypothesized by the ASR. Figure 2 plots the per-
centage of words with correction times equal to or
lower than the time on the x-axis. While this starts
at the initial 58.6 % of words that were immediately
correct, it rises above 90 % for a correction time of
320 ms and above 95 % for 550 ms. Inversely this
means that we can be certain to 90 % (or 95 %) that
a current correct hypothesis about a word will not
change anymore once it has not been revoked for
320 ms (or 550 ms respectively).
Knowing (or assuming with some certainty) that
a hypothesis is final allows us, to commit ourselves
to this hypothesis. This allows for reduced compu-
tational overhead (as alternative hypotheses can be
abandoned) and is crucial if action is to be taken that
cannot be revoked later on (as for example, initiat-
ing a response from the dialogue system). Figure 2
allows us to choose an operating point for commit-
ment with respect to hypothesis age and certainty.

tails of the specific setting, such as quality of the
audio material and of the language model, we var-
ied these factors systematically, by adding white
noise to the audio and changing the language model
weight relative to the acoustic model. We varied the
noise to produce signal to noise ratios ranging from
hardly audible (−20 dB), through annoying noise
(−10 dB) to barely understandable audio (0 dB).
Figure 3 gives an overview of the ASR-
performance with different LM weights and figure 4
with degraded audio signals. Overall, we see that
r-correctness and EO change little with different
LM and AM performance and correspondigly de-
graded WER. A tendency can be seen that larger LM
weights result in higher correctness and lower EO. A
larger LM weight leads to less influence of acoustic
events which dynamically change hypotheses, while
the static knowledge from the LM becomes more
important. Surprisingly, WER improved with the
addition of slight noise, which we assume is due to
differences in recording conditions between our test
data and the training data of the acoustic model.
In the following experiments as well as in the data
in table 1 above, we use a language model weight of
8 and unaltered audio.

aries to restrict the language model hypotheses to
an acoustically plausible subset (Ortmanns and Ney,
2000). In the experiment described here, we allow
the ASR a larger right context of size A by taking
into account at time t the output of the ASR up to
time t − A only. That is, what the ASR hypothe-
sizes about the interval ]t − A, t] is considered to
be too immature and is discarded, and the hypothe-
ses about the input up to t − A have the benefit of a
lookahead up to t. This reduces jitter, which is found
mostly to the very right of the incremental hypothe-
ses. Thus, we expect to reduce the edit overhead in
proportion with A. On the other hand, allowing the
use of a right context leads to the current hypothe-
sis lagging behind the gold standard. Correspond-
ingly, WFC increases by A. Obviously, using only
information up to t − A has averse effects on cor-
rectness as well, as this measure evaluates the word
sequences up to wgoldt which may already contain
more words (those recognised in ]t − A, t]). Thus,
to be more fair and to account for the lag when mea-
suring the module’s correctness, we additionally de-
fine fair r-correctness which restricts the evaluation
up to time t − A: whyptt_Δ = wgoldt_Δ.
Figure 5 details the results for our data with right
context between 1.5 s and −0.2 s. (The x-axis plots

measure, fixed lag performs quite well at improving
both the module’s correctness and EO. This is due
to the fact that ASR hypotheses become more and
more stable when given more right context. Still,
even for fairly long lags, many late edits still occur.
To illustrate the effects of a system that does not
support edits of hypotheses, but instead commits
right away, we plot WER that would be reached by a
system that always commits after a right context of
A. As can be seen in the figure, the WER remains
higher than the non-incremental WER (18.8 %) even
for fairly large right contexts. Also, the WER plot by
Wachsmuth et al. (1998) looks very similar to ours
and likewise shows a sweet spot suitable as an oper-
ating point with a right context of about 800 ms.
As expected, the analysis of timing measures
shows an increase with larger right contexts with
their mean values quickly approaching A (or
A− mean word duration for WFF), which are the
lower bounds when using right context. Correspond-
ingly, the percentage of immediately correct hy-
potheses increases with right context reaching 90 %
for A = 580 ms and 98 % for A =1060 ms.
Finally, we can extend the concept of right con-
text into negative values, predicting the future, as it
were. By choosing a negative right context, in which
we extrapolate the last hypothesis state by A into the
future, we can measure the correctness of our hy-
potheses correctly predicting the close future, which
is always the case when the current word is still be-

ing spoken. The graph shows that 15 % of our hy-
potheses will still be correct 100 ms in the future and
10 % will still be correct for 170 ms. Unfortunately,
there is little way to tell apart hypotheses that will
survive and those which will soon be revised.

In the previous section we reduced wrong edit mes-
sages by avoiding most of the recognition jitter by
allowing the ASR a right context of size A, which
directly hurt timing measures by roughly the same
amount. In this section, we look at the sequence of
partial hypotheses from the incremental ASR, using
the dynamic properties as cues. We accomplish this
by looking at the edit messages relative to the cur-
rently output word sequence. But instead of sending
them to a consumer directly (updating the external
word sequence), we require that an edit message be
the result of N consecutive hypotheses. To illustrate
the process with N = 2 we return to figure 1. None
of the words “an”, “ein” or “zwar” would ever be
output, because they are only present for one time-
interval each. Edit messages would be sent at the
following times: ⊕(eins) at t7, ⊕(zwei) at t10 (only
then is “zwei” the result of two consecutive hypothe-
ses) and ⊕(drei) at t13. While no words are revoked
in the example, this still occurs when a revocation is
consecutively hypothesized for N frames.
We get controversial results for this strategy, as
can be seen in figure 6: The edit overhead falls
rapidly, reaching 50 % (for each message necessary,
there is one superfluous message) with only 110 ms
(and correspondingly increasing WFC by the same
time) and 10 % with 320 ms. The same thresh-
olds are reached through the use of right context at
530 ms and 1150 ms respectively as shown in fig-
ure 5. Likewise, the prefix correctness improve-
ments are better than with using right context, but
the r-correctness is poor, even under the “fair” mea-
sure. We believe this is due to correct hypotheses
being held back too long due to the hypothesis se-
quence being interspersed with wrong hypotheses
(which only last for few consecutive hypotheses)
which reset the counter until the add message (for
the prevalent and potentially correct word) is sent.8

smoothing instead of requiring a message to be the result of all
consecutive hypotheses. We will investigate this in future work.

<bodyText confidence="0.999995434782608">
We have presented the problem of speech recogni-
tion for incremental systems, outlined requirements
for incremental speech recognition and showed mea-
sures that capture how well an incremental ASR per-
forms with regard to these measures. We discussed
the measures and their implications in detail with
our baseline system and showed that the incremen-
tal measures remain stable regardless of the specific
ASR setting used.
Finally, we presented ways for the online post-
processing of incremental results, looking for ways
to improve some of the measures defined, while
hurting the other measures as little as possible.
Specifically, we were interested in generating less
wrong hypotheses at the cost of possible short de-
lays. While using right context shows improvements
with larger delays, using message smoothing seems
especially useful for fast processing. We think these
two approaches could be combined to good effect.
Together with more elaborate confidence handling a
system could quickly generate hypotheses and then
refine the associated confidences over time. We will
explore this in future work.

(2001)), as it allows the system to (a) fold processing time (of modules such as parsers, or dialogue managers) into the time taken by the utterance, and (b) react to partial results, for example by generating back-channel utterances or speculatively initiating potentially relevant database queries. Input to a spoken dialogue system normally passes an automatic speech recognizer (ASR) as a first processing module, thus the module’s incrementality determines the level of incrementality that can be reached by the system as a whole.

ASR modules that use token passing (Young et al., 1989) can easily be adapted to output a new, live hypothesis after processing of every input frame (often that is every 10 ms).

We are less concerned with correctness measures, as they do not capture well the dynamic evolution, which is important for further processing of the incremental hypothesis. We also discuss tradeoffs that are involved in the optimization decisions. 4.1 Right Context Allowing the use of some right context is a common strategy to cope with incremental data. For example, our ASR already uses this strategy (with very short right contexts) internally at word boundaries to restrict the language model hypotheses to an acoustically plausible subset (Ortmanns and Ney, 2000). In the experiment described here, we allow the ASR a larger right context of size A by taking into account at time t the output of the ASR up to time t − A only. That is, what the ASR hypothesizes about the interval ]t − A, t] is considered to be too immature and is discarded, and the hypotheses about the input up to t − A have the benefit of a lookahead up to t. This reduces jitter, which is found mostly to the very right of the incremental hypotheses. Thus, we expect to reduce the edit overhead in proportion with A.
