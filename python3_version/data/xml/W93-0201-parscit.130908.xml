It is generally agreed that coherent discourse consists of segments that are related to one
another. A number of researchers have argued for the use of rhetorical[G 67&apos;5] or coherence relations
[llob79], and the rhetorical relations specified by R.S&apos;i&amp;quot; [MT87] have been used in structuring text
[11ov88, MP90]. In this paper, we examine rhetorical relations in the context of dialogue, rather
than single-speaker text. We argue that reasoning about relational propositions is necessary but
not sufficient for structuring dialogue, point out several problems of applying li.sT to dialogue, and
argue for the necessity of recognizing the intentions underlying utterances and the rich relationships
among these intentions.
Our research on recognizing expressions of doubt and interpreting indirect; replies provides
evidence that what Moore and Pollack call informational level relations [M i&apos;92] play an important
role in identifying intentions in dialogue. Consider some continuations of the following dialogue
sequence:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.99899025">
(1.) SI: &amp;quot;Who is teaching (16o (a systems morsel?&amp;quot;
(2) 52: &amp;quot;Dr. Smith is trachiny (SA0.&amp;quot;
(3) Si: &amp;quot;Isn&apos;t Dr. Smith on sabbatical?&amp;quot;
(4) S2: &amp;quot;No, he&apos;s not On sabbatical.&amp;quot;
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.963175333333333">
If Si responds with &amp;quot;Wasn&apos;t Dr. ,cmith woortyled Fa/bright?&amp;quot;, then since it is plausible that
Dr. Smith having a Fit&apos;bright; would result in his going on sabbatical, SI&apos;s utterance should be
interpreted as expressing doubt at the proposition that Dr. Smith is not cut sabbatical. Similarly,
if being a systems person is necessary for teaching (.S360 and SI responds with &amp;quot;Isn&apos;t D7&apos;. Smith a
theory person?&amp;quot;, then since Dr. Smith being a theory person is an alternative to Dr. Smith being a
systems person, Sl&apos;s utterance should be interpreted as expressing doubt at the proposition that Dr.
Smith is teaching CS360. But if SI had instead asked &amp;quot;Isn&apos;t CS240 a plelequisite for C5300?&amp;quot;,S1&apos;s
utterance should be interpreted as seeking new information since there is no plausible informational
relation suggesting that the new utterance contributes to determining whether Dr. Smith is on
sabbatical or to identifying the instructor of (&amp;quot;S360. Titus, identifying the informational relationship
between utterances is essential for responding appropriately. [LC92] provides an algorithm that
utilizes such relations in recognizing expressions of doubt.

Our research on interpreting indirect replies [G C92] provides additional evidence that in-
formational relations play an important role in discourse interpretation. Consider the following
dialogue sequence:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9992165">
(5) Si: &amp;quot;Did Harry see his girlfriend last weekend?&amp;quot;
(6) S2: &amp;quot;He left for New York on Friday.&amp;quot;
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999841448275862">
We have shown [GC92] that Si and 52&apos;s shared a.ssumption that 52&apos;s indirect answer in (5) is
coherently related to sonic possible direct answer is necessary to enable SI to identify S2&apos;s intended
(but implicit) answer of &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;No&amp;quot;. For example, suppose SI believes that it is mutually be-
lieved that Harry and his girlfriend both live in Denver. Then, Si would interpret (6) as describing
an alternative to Harry seeing his girlfriend and thus would infer a negative answer to (5). On
the other hand, suppose Si believes that it is mutually believed that Harry lives in Denver but his
girlfriend lives in New York. Then, Si would interpret (6) as describing an action enabling Harry
to see his girlfriend and thus would infer a, positive answer. In other words, Si&apos;s recognition of
the relational proposition which S2 intended to convey is necessary for interpreting 52&apos;s intended
answer. If Si failed to recognize such a relation, then Si would be unable to answer a question
such as &amp;quot;Why didn&apos;t Harry see his girlfriend last weekend?&amp;quot; Thus in our model [GC92], the appli-
cability conditions of discourse plan operators for answering a Yes/No question include conditions
requiring that components of the response (whether implicit or explicit) be related by coherence
relations similar to informational-level rhetorical relations. Since the same set of operators is used
in generating answers, informational relations also play a role in ensuring that an indirect answer
is appropriate. In other words, the informational relations constrain what, extra in (infor-
mation not specifically requested by the (uestioner) may be included in an appropriate response.
An indirect answer is generated by use of the extm information alone.
In our view, this extra information may serve a rhetorical function such as to increase belief.
For example, S2 might have decided to include the extra information in (6) (that Harry left for
New York on Friday) in his negative answer because S2 anticipated that SI would have doubted
a simple &amp;quot;No&amp;quot;. In our current research, we are defining stimulus conditions for use of the extra
information in an answer. A stimulus condition describes a situation in which it may be beneficial
to include information that was neither requested nor what the speaker had a. prior intention to
convey. Thus, stimulus conditions are used to select an appropriate informational relation.
However, we contend that rhetorical relations, especially as defined by R ST, are insufficient
for characterizing dialogue. Although one might consider developing a. larger set of rhetorical
relations [Hob79], tire following dialogue ca.n not be completely characterized by rhetorical relations
between segments.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999775666666667">
(7) Si: &amp;quot;The Al class must be cancelled today.&amp;quot;
(8) &amp;quot;John is taking the course and he just went home.&amp;quot;
(9) 52: &amp;quot;John often cuts classes.&amp;quot;
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999669">
Although one might argue that there is a Motivate-Volitional-Action relation between John cutting
class in (9) and John going home in (8), the function of utterance (9) is to attack the evidence
relationship between utterances (8) and (7), which RST cannot account for since RST captures
relations between spans of text whereas (9) is refuting the implicit proposition between (7)-(8), not
the text itself.
In addition, rhetorical relations as defined in RST relate satellites to a. nucleus, which to-
gether form an uninterrtpIe(text span. However, in dialogue, an utterance may relate to an earlier

utterance U yet be separated front U by other utterances that do not relate to U. In such cases,
expectations about speaker intentions play a major role in understanding, as illustrated by the
following example.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.997830333333333">
(10) Sl: &amp;quot;AI is the best C071.1&amp;quot;tie to take next semester.&amp;quot;
(11) S2: &amp;quot;You should take Computer Graphics instead.&amp;quot;
(12) Si: &amp;quot;Dr. Smith is teaching A/ and he&apos;s wonderful.&amp;quot;
(13) S2: &amp;quot;Dr. Brown is teaching Graphics and he&apos;s a givat teacher.&amp;quot;
(14) Sl: &amp;quot;The Al projects sound like a lot of fun.&amp;quot;
(15) 52: &amp;quot;Computer Graphics has you drawing all kinds of objects.&amp;quot;
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999030833333333">
S1 and S2 each declare a claim in utterances (10) and (11). Although one can argue that an
alternative relation holds between utterances (12) and (13) and between utterances (14) and (15),
the structure of the dialogue is not completely captured by relating these consecutive pairs of
utterances. Utterances (12) and (14) support 51&apos;s claim ill (10), and utterances (13) and (15)
support S2&apos;s claim in (11). Although one might suggest dropping the requirement that rhetorical
relations relate a span of utterances, it is unclear how rhetorical relations alone could handle
complex dialogues. We believe that in identifying the structure of dialogues such as the above,
expectations about the discourse goals of the participants must be taken into account (in this case,
a speaker supporting his/her own claim and indirectly attacking that of the other) and a. more
elaborate intentional structure allowed.
Furthermore, utterances can simultaneously serve more than one function, which would
require two distinct RST analyses. Consider the following dialogue sequence:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.99837775">
(16) &amp;quot;Can you come to a party at my house Saturday nig ht?&amp;quot;
(17) S2: &amp;quot;No, I can&apos;t.&amp;quot;
(18) &amp;quot;I have to work.&amp;quot;
(19) &amp;quot;So I am very sorry, but I must decline your invitation.&amp;quot;
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999510842105263">
Utterance (16) conveys both a literal question and an invitation. Two RST analyses are required
for S2&apos;s response, one relating (17) and (18) to the literal question and the other relating (19) to the
invitation. However, R,ST requires a single analysis and a hierarchical structure. In addition, RST
cannot account for the fact that if (19) is omitted from 52&apos;s response, it, may still be implicated.
Recognizing intentions is essential for dialogue understanding, since these intentions pro-
vide expectations used in interpreting subsequent utterances and identifying the structure of the
dialogue. For example, we show in [GC92] that expectations about discourse goals play a. role in
the interpretation of indirect replies to Yes/No questions. After Sl&apos;s request for information in
the exchange (5) - (6), Si and S2 share the expectation that S2&apos;s response will convey the re-
quested information. This expectation is used to focus on a. certain set of discourse plan operators
representing mutually accessible knowledge of standard forms for giving a positive or negative an-
swer. Furthermore, our dialogue model [L(9 I] captures not only communicative intentions but, also
domain and problem-solving intentions, and these intentions result in a set of expectations that
facilitate understanding subsequent. utterances and generating appropriate responses. In [Chu93],
we explore response generation in collattorative dialogue.
Although current research has been concerned with recognizing the intentions that. in speaker
is trying to convey, we believe that an effective and intelligent system must do more. If a system
is to handle naturally occurring dialogue, which can range front completely cooperative to non-
cooperative in a single interaction, then the system must be able. to recognize hidden intentions,
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.993705">

<bodyText confidence="0.999982545454545">
such as the intention to lie or deceive. Although recognition of such hidden intentions may not be
essential for identifying the structure of the discourse, it is necessary for the systein&apos;s responses to
be intelligent, natural, and effective.
So what makes a. dialogue coherent? We believe that dialogue coherence depends upon both
informational and intentional level properties of the dialogue. We contend that a natural language
dialogue system must be able to recognize a speaker&apos;s intentions, that this recognition of intention
is often aided by identification of informational level relational propositions, and that in many cases
a speaker intends for these informational level relations to be recognized (as in the exchange given
in (5) - (6)). Our research has led us to conclude that rhetorical relations as specified by BST
are necessary but not sufficient for handling dialogues — the rich relationships among discourse
intentions must also be captured.

But if SI had instead asked &amp;quot;Isn&apos;t CS240 a plelequisite for C5300?&amp;quot;,S1&apos;s utterance should be interpreted as seeking new information since there is no plausible informational relation suggesting that the new utterance contributes to determining whether Dr. Smith is on sabbatical or to identifying the instructor of (&amp;quot;S360. Titus, identifying the informational relationship between utterances is essential for responding appropriately. [LC92] provides an algorithm that utilizes such relations in recognizing expressions of doubt. 1 Our research on interpreting indirect replies [G C92] provides additional evidence that informational relations play an important role in discourse interpretation. Consider the following dialogue sequence: (5) Si: &amp;quot;Did Harry see his girlfriend last weekend?&amp;quot; (6) S2: &amp;quot;He left for New York on Friday.&amp;quot; We have shown [GC92] that Si and 52&apos;s shared a.ssumption that 52&apos;s indirect answer in (5) is coherently related to sonic possible direct answer is necessary to enable SI to identify S2&apos;s intended (but implici</context>

A number of researchers have argued for the use of rhetorical[G 67&apos;5] or coherence relations [llob79], and the rhetorical relations specified by R.S&apos;i&amp;quot; [MT87] have been used in structuring text [11ov88, MP90]. In this paper, we examine rhetorical relations in the context of dialogue, rather than single-speaker text. We argue that reasoning about relational propositions is necessary but not sufficient for structuring dialogue, point out several problems of applying li.sT to dialogue, and argue for the necessity of recognizing the intentions underlying utterances and the rich relationships among these intentions. Our research on recognizing expressions of doubt and interpreting indirect; replies provides evidence that what Moore and Pollack call info</context>
