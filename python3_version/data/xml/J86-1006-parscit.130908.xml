all sequential or serial order. They all presuppose a rule-
based system that can be enumerated in a &amp;quot;decidable&amp;quot;
sense and that includes hierarchical enumeration during
rule-application. Even the discussion of the computa-
tional approach presented by Schank and Birnbaum
includes nuances of this.
There are relevant discussions of how one can acquire
language and how it might map the real world into a
&amp;quot;usable&amp;quot; representation that permits variability. Howev-
er, these are presented at a theoretical level. There is not
sufficient material included to &amp;quot;make the theory
computational&amp;quot;. It is very interesting to note that the
processor, meaning the human brain, can constrain how
the real world projects into a subjective perceptual world,
and to provide discussion of same, but the issues of how
such a processor might control such a happening are
avoided. In contrast, for artificial intelligence, determin-
ing the process and the control presents the greatest
problem.
The psychological perspective provides a brief histor-
ical introduction to the issues considered important by
psychologists with respect to the language problem.
Many of the concerns regarding the function of repres-
entations, and the relationship between theoretical and
applied work and psycholinguistics are similar to those
expressed by the computational discussions. However,
the stress on evaluation of theories which is of utmost
importance to psychological approaches does not appear
of such concern in Al.
One area which the psychological discussion merely
touches has to do with CONTROL of the processes.
While control is mentioned, no suggestions as to how it
should become a viable part of language process or theo-
ry from a psychological perspective are presented.
Instead, all of the theories presuppose a sequential proc-
ess, at least as they are presented in the included papers.
No CONTROL alternatives are discussed, as if the prob-
lem is already solved.
One other psychological paper discusses whether there
are language-specific tasks, i.e., tasks that cannot be
&amp;quot;learned&amp;quot; or performed unless one has language. While
the issues raised are interesting, the presentation and
discussion of the evidence is far from convincing.
Perhaps it is available elsewhere, but certainly is just
touched upon here.
Finally, the discussion within the computational
approaches to language is not anything that has not been
presented many times before. Basically, two viewpoints
are presented, one the semantically driven approach to
language processing and the other which demonstrates
that there are critical aspects of language understanding
that can only be syntactically determined
The arguments presented in Marcus&apos;s paper advocat-
ing a separate role for syntactic processing were the most
clearly described in the book. If anyone is seeking exam-
ple inputs which require syntactic decision processes that
cannot be handled entirely within semantic processing, or
cannot even be recognized as a problem if one is doing

strictly semantic processing, this paper includes several.
They are all discussed from a linguistic standpoint and
not a performance one, even though there is performance
evidence to support a distinct role for syntax in process-
ing. (Cf. the vast literature of neurolinguistics on aphasic
language problems as well as evidence discussed with
respect to children with language impairments.)
After finishing this book, I felt that I had re-read a
discussion of many issues which were first being
addressed in the early attempts to define cognitive
science. They are still undecided, but there presently are
more cohesive approaches being undertaken. While each
paper presents discussion of important cognitive science
issues, given the title of the book I had hoped there
would be a more integrated discussion of how these
issues might be resolved.
The book is useful as a reference for anyone seeking
an introduction to the magnitude of problems within
cognitive science. It also provides some historical
perspectives which are not explicitly documented else-
where. But, it does not reflect any more recent attempts
to integrate the viewpoints expressed that are the focus
of research in many schools of cognitive science, where
the integration, the shared discussions of the problems,
the common approaches are underway.

The book appears to be concerned with three major
points. First, the reader can find a brief outline of the
state of the art in many fields of Artificial Intelligence:
natural language parsing, question-answering, question-
ing and summarizing of texts, paraphrasing and translat-
ing into different languages, and finally a survey on
knowledge systems. Therefore the book is extremely
useful to those who wish to know what has been done or
can be done in Al. Secondly, it is also conceived as an
introduction to procedural logic and how to apply it to
the analysis of natural language and to the various
performances listed above. Hence, the book is also
important for those who want to achieve this specific
programming competence.
The third point (which, however, is not explicitly
declared by the author) has to do with the way natural
language and the human cognitive system must be
approached. Obviously, the approach described in the
book is a procedural one; i.e., the author describes algo-
rithms for performing various cognitive tasks, such as
understanding natural language, producing natural
Computational Linguistics, Volume 12, Number 1, January-March 1986 41
Book Reviews Computations from the English
language sequences, question-answering, etc. However,
the way the author considers linguistics and cognitive
psychology in general does not appear to be the most
productive one. The question that must be raised is the
following: To what purpose can it be useful to introduce
concepts and descriptions that are highly questionable
from the point of view of recent results in formal linguis-
tics and cognitive psychology, instead of assuming
correct information also for what concerns these research
fields? In fact, the aspects that have to do with cognitive
psychology in general, and linguistics in particular, are
only very roughly sketched in the book.
The study of natural language and cognitive psychol-
ogy are not the major goals of Simmons&apos;s book, but
nevertheless the problem remains serious; there is in fact
a general question concerning the concrete possibility of
achieving results in Al both from the point of view of the
cognitive import, and the practical applicability, without
considering and adopting the results of cognitive psychol-
ogy. For instance, how can it be possible to build
systems of automatic translation with a theory of gram-
mar that accounts in a general way for the differences
among languages? How can it be possible to build a
question-answering system without considering the
semantics of questions? How can one deal with a
&amp;quot;large&amp;quot; vocabulary without analyzing the morphological
regularities and characteristics of each language? Even if
these are not Simmons&apos;s major concerns, we think that he
should at least provide guidelines in these directions, for
instance by suggesting integrative readings.
Our opinion is that the level of precision and specifica-
tion achieved by linguistics (and cognitive psychology in
general) is not technically needed in computer science
and artificial intelligence for the time being; however in a
few years progress in these fields will be such that it will
become impossible to create good products without the
cooperation of linguists and psychologists. Moreover, in
addition to technological improvements, one would also
expect from Al new empirical discoveries on the human
cognitive system and its procedural strategies in general;
we hope that these goals will be achieved by future
research.
By way of conclusion we can say that this book is an
interesting and detailed introduction to procedural logic
and related topics. Therefore, it is useful reading it, even
if the linguist or the psychologist will not find anything
new in his/her field.
