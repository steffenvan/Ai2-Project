We discuss a syntactic annotation scheme for Chi-
nese text corpora following a dependency-based
framework that admits no intermediate phrasal
nodes and allows no crossing of syntactic depen-
dency links. While one particular approach to syn-
tactic analysis is being followed, dependency anno-
tation facilitates the use of annotated corpora by
followers of other approaches.

<bodyText confidence="0.999516677419355">
Major linguistic theories like GB/MP (Chomsky,
1986; Chomsky, 1995), HPSG (Pollard and Sag,
1994) and LFG (Bresnan, 1982) agree to represent
syntactic structures in terms of phrase structures,
but disagree about what kinds of phrase structures
should be assigned to the same linguistic expres-
sions. In a project on syntactic annotation of Chi-
nese corpora, we represent syntactic structures in
terms of dependency.
We follow an approach (Lai and Huang, 1998a;
Lai and Huang, 1999a) to Dependency Grammar
(Tesniere, 1959; Gaifman, 1965; Hays, 1964; Robin-
son, 1970), that requires syntactic dependency to
be single-headed and projective. Unlike Depen-
dency Grammar schools that allow multiple-headed
and non-projective dependency structures (Hud-
son, 1984; Mereuk, 1988; Starosta, 1988; Hajieova,
1991), single-headedness and projectivity are main-
tained in a syntactic skeleton, with reference to
which constraints to capture non-projective phe-
nomena in language are anchored. In experimental
implementations (Lai and Huang, 1998b; Lai and
Huang, 1999b) of this approach, projective syntac-
tic dependency structures are generated subject to
the constraints of sub categorization properties of the
words concerned as well as other grammatical con-
siderations. This approach is different from many
works in dependency-based parsing (Hellwig, 1986;
Covington, 1990; Courtin and Genthial, 1998; Bour-
don et al., 1998) in that the relationship between the
governor and all its dependents are immediate and

no intermediate phrasal nodes are necessary. Similar
&amp;quot;flat&amp;quot; syntactic structures have recently been sug-
gested in phrase-structure grammars (Houma et al.,
1998; Przepiorkowski, 1999).
In preparation for large-scale annotation, we are
carrying out manual syntactic annotation of a small
Chinese legal text corpus. The text is first processed
using a &amp;quot;segmentation&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;tagging&amp;quot; tool (Lai et
al., 1992; Lai et al., 1998). The tokens are then
subjected to morphological analysis to confirm and
adjust word boundaries. Words, as the units that
are operated on in syntactic analysis, form the basis
of an SGML-based annotation scheme. The annota-
tion scheme also recognizes larger parsing units like
phrases and sentences and smaller units like charac-
ters and dictionary entries, which may or may not
coincide with the words.
Following accepted practices of text corpora anno-
tation, the original character sequences of the raw
corpus are preserved as the terminally tagged ele-
ments. This enables recovery from possible errors in
morphological and syntactic analysis. The represen-
tation of syntactic relationships in terms of depen-
dency also facilitates the use of the annotated corpus
by followers of other approaches.

2.1 Projective syntactic dependency
skeleton
In Dependency Grammar (Tesniere, 1959), words
are linked to one another by asymmetrical governor-
dependent relationships. Syntactic dependency
structures are constrained by Robinson (1970) as fol-
lows:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.985815333333333">
(1) a. One and only one element is indepen-
dent.
b. All others depend directly on some ele-
ment.
c. No element depends directly on more
than one other.

</page>
<listItem confidence="0.9447114">
d. If A depends directly on B and some ele-
ment C intervenes between them (in lin-
ear order of string), then C depends di-
rectly on A or on B or some other inter-
vening element.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.952977933333333">
Robinson requires that a word should not depend on
more than one word. She also requires that syntactic
dependency structures be projective in the sense that
dependency links should not cross one another.
For example, the projectivity criterion will be vio-
lated if the word ía (le&apos;) in the Chinese sentence (2)
is considered to depend on the matrix verb xiang
(`wanted&apos;) and the embedded verb via° (laugh&apos;) at
the same time.
(2) Ta xiang xiao.
he want laugh
He wants/wanted to laugh.&apos;
In Figure 1, the dependency link between ta and xiao
crosses the branch linking the matrix verb ruing to
the root node. This situation is dealt with by sug-

that ía is the subject of xiao is accounted for by a
specification in the lexical entry of the word xiang:
the subject of xiang is the subject of its predicate
complement xiao. Other non-projective linguistic
phenomena are dealt with similarly by grammatical
constraints defined in terms of the nodes and arcs of
the projective syntactic dependency skeleton.

2.2 Dependency rules
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9023885">
Projective dependency structures can be generated
using Hays&apos; (1964) dependency rules.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.917517333333333">
(3) a. X(A, B, C, , *, Y, , Z)
b. X(*)
c. *(X)

<bodyText confidence="0.999523818181818">
In (3), dependents of the governor X are listed be-
tween a pair of brackets, with the asterisk * indicat-
ing the position of the governor itself.
Hays&apos; rules have the disadvantage of having
word order (of dependents with the same gover-
nor) built into the rule mechanism. This disadvan-
tage is removed by making dependency rules binary-
branching.
Repeated application of binary-branching depen-
dency rules will over-generate, but sub categorization
properties of the governing word and global gram-
matical constraints of the language will co-operate
to function as a filter and account for the correct
ensemble of dependent elements in the &amp;quot;domain&amp;quot; of
the governor.
In dependency rules, the governor and its place-
holder * are not only of the same type, as in phrase-
structure rewrite rules, but also token-identical. The
result is that a &amp;quot;phrase&amp;quot; is indistinguishable from its
head word, and the ensemble of a head word and its
dependent is a &amp;quot;flat&amp;quot; structure without intermediate
phrasal nodes.

3.1 A small text corpus
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9995016">
We begin with manually annotating a small corpus,
with a plan to scale up with the help of the expe-
rience gained. We use a small corpus of Chinese
text segmented and tagged using a bigram-based
segmentation-tagging tool (Lai et al., 1998). The
corpus is two &amp;quot;chapters&amp;quot; of a statute in an East
Asian Chinese community (Hong Kong). It contains
4797 tokens produced by the segmentation-tagging
tool. Because of its small size, this corpus is stylis-
tically not balanced, which is to be borne in mind.

The terminal text elements, marked by the &lt; cu &gt;
tags, are Chinese (Han) characters in a two-byte en-
coding scheme. They are written in the phonetic
pingyin script in this paper for the benefit of the
reader.
The largest text unit for syntactic analysis shown
here is not the sentence, but the parsing unit
&lt; pt &gt;. There are six such units in the example:
an ordinal numerical phrase, a chapter title, two nu-
meral construction in Arabic numberals, a section
heading, and a one-sentence subsection text.
The words, as the basic units of subsequent syn-
tactic analysis, play a key role in the annotation
scheme. The semantic glosses of the words are given
in the sm attribute. In general, sub-word morpho-
logical units are contained within the scope of a
&lt; wt &gt; tag. The &lt; du &gt; tag marks dictionary
entries as a sub-word units, which, especially in Chi-
nese, often do not coincide with the words they con-
stitute.
The tags &lt; wt &gt; and &lt; cu &gt; correspond to the
&lt; w &gt; and &lt; c &gt; tags for linguistic segmentation
elements in CES (Ide et al., 1996). The usage of
&lt; mu &gt;, however, is different from that of &lt; m &gt;
in CES. We do not have tags corresponding to &lt; c/ &gt;
and &lt; phr &gt; in CES. As noted earlier, &lt;p &gt; can
be a word, a phrase or a sentence.
The &lt; wt &gt; elements have an index attribute
wi to mark their positions within the &lt; pu &gt; unit.
They also have a gv attribute recording the wi in-
dices of their governors. A value of 0 shows that the
word is the head element of the &lt; pu &gt;. The syntac-
tic category of the word is given by the ct attribute,
and its relation to its immediate governor is the fn
attribute.
When values are assigned to the gv attribute of
&lt; wt &gt;, care is taken to have Robinson&apos;s &amp;quot;axioms&amp;quot;
of well-formedness (1) observed. Projectivity is en-
sured by checking that the gv value of a word is
neither smaller than that of any words preceding it
in the same &lt; pt &gt; nor greater than that of any
other words following it in the &lt; pu &gt;.
In our annotation scheme, morphemes (mu) are
marked only when they are not adequately covered
by the words and the dictionary entries. When they
morphemes are marked, as in &lt; pu pi = 1 &gt; and
&lt; pu pi = 2&gt;, they are not marked as constituents
of a wt. This will be explained later in this paper.

4 Basic features of the annotation
scheme
</sectionHeader>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998136">
4.1 Preservation of raw text elements
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999962875">
Chinese texts are stored as sequences of &amp;quot;characters&amp;quot;
without explicit word boundary marks. With very
few exceptions, Chinese characters are meaning-
bearing syllables. They may function either as one-
morpheme words or as morphemes that combine to
form words. Unfortunately, Chinese linguists do not
always agree about how a given sequence of char-
acters should be &amp;quot;segmented&amp;quot; in words. It is thus
important that the raw character sequence of the
original text should be preserved for the benefit of
people who do not agree with us.
The basic encoding units of European texts are
the letters of the alphabet. Letters combine to form
words, which are marked off from one another by
white spaces (though sometimes &amp;quot;words&amp;quot; will have
to be combined to form compound words). It is thus
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.995636">
13
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999958090909091">
not uncommon for the terminally tagged units of an-
notated European texts to be (lemmatized) words.
This will be fine if the morphological analysis is al-
ways correct, but will make recovery from errors like
mistaking &amp;quot;bake[PAsT]&amp;quot; for &amp;quot;bake[PART]&amp;quot; difficult.
In our annotation scheme, punctuation marks are
also preserved and marked as such in our annotation
scheme. Besides providing hints for syntactic and
pragmatic analysis, they also mark off small chunks
of character sequences for the segmentation-tagging
program to operate on.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99356">
4.2 Flexibility of parsing units
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999588166666666">
In Chinese test, as well as in texts in other languages,
the chunk of text that one has to feed into a &amp;quot;sen-
tence&amp;quot; analyzer are often not a sentence. In the
example in the previous section, &lt; pt pi = 1 &gt;,
&lt; pu pi = 2&gt;, &lt; pu pi = 3&gt;, &lt; pu pi = 4&gt;
and &lt; pu pi = 5 &gt; are all not sentences. In an En-
glish translation of the text, they may be rendered as
Chapter Seven, The Form of a Contract, 7.1, Form,
and 7.1.1 respectively, which should also be treated
as non-sentence parsing units.
Thus, we allow parse units to be anything sug-
gested by the text itself, shown in the example,
they may be words, phrases and, of course, sen-
tences. Parse units form separate domains for the
position indices of their constituent words. Head
words of parse units are not assigned governors of
of their own. Relationships between parse units are
considered to belong to the realm of pragmatics.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.970432">
4.3 Dependency marking
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999692">
We do not mark phrase structures. There no brack-
eting as in the PENN Treebank. There are no in-
termediate phrase nodes as in GB/MP, HPSG and
LFG, and the relationship between governor and de-
pendent is always direct. This does not not solve the
problem of different approaches producing different
syntactic structures for the same linguistic expres-
sion, but rather accentuates it in a somewhat posi-
tive sense. This will be discussed in greater detail in
a later section.

5 Morphological complications
</sectionHeader>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.990282">
5.1 Deriving words from dictionary units
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.946792315789473">
In Chinese, as in all other languages, words may
combine to form larger compounds words. It is often
justified to have compound words listed in our dic-
tionary. Sometimes, however, listing a word formed
from simpler words in a dictionary can be unrealistic
or unreasonable.
The third &lt; pt &gt; in Section 3.2, repeated below,
serves to illustrate this.
&lt;pu pi=3&gt;
&lt;wu wi=1 gv=0 ct=mx sm=&amp;quot;7.1&amp;quot;›
&lt;du tg=mx&gt;&lt;cu&gt;7&lt;du tg=&amp;quot;.&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;cu&gt;.
&lt;du tg=mx&gt;&lt;cu&gt;1
&lt;/pu&gt;
The segmentation-tagging program outputs three
&amp;quot;tokens&amp;quot; as candidates for separate words. We ad-
just the word boundaries and group the three char-
acters together to form only one word (&lt; wt &gt;),
which is a kind or numerical label.
We do not consider this an error of the
segmentation-tagging program. Numeral characters
like 7, &amp;quot;.&amp;quot; and I are dictionary entries that are,
with the helps of marks like the point &amp;quot;.&amp;quot; , capable
of combining transparently to form an infinite num-
ber of words like 7.1, which is not, and cannot all
be, listed in a dictionary. In the example, we mark
the three characters as a word, but also retain the
information that this word is composed from the
three one-character dictionary entries. The gram-
matical information originally attached to the three
constituent &amp;quot;tokens&amp;quot; are retained. They are tagged
as dictionary entries (&lt; du &gt;).
Obviously, word units like 7.1 are also possible
in other languages. Besides, in Chinese and in other
languages, it is sometimes difficult to decide whether
a number of space-separated &amp;quot;words&amp;quot; should com-
bine to form a compound word. In view of this,
dictionary unit tags are a good way to ensure the
usefulness of the annotated corpus.

In di4qi1, the prefix di4 is attached to the cardinal
number qi1 (`seven&apos;) to turn it into an ordinal num-
ber. Like -th and -ieme in English and French, di4
is a bound morpheme in modern Chinese. However,
this prefix is listed as a separate entry in all Chi-
nese dictionaries, and the ordinary native speaker
has difficulty in seeing it as different from &amp;quot;real&amp;quot;
words in the language. Anyway, no graphical hints
are available to distinguish between free and bound
morphemes in Chinese text.
In respect of the rather general practice of the Chi-
nese computational linguistics community to mark
off bound grammatical morphemes like di4 as sep-
arate &amp;quot;words&amp;quot;. affixes are marked as &lt; mu &gt; and
placed immediately under &lt; pu &gt; like &lt; wt &gt;.
However, as we choose to consider affixes as part of
the words to which they are attached, they are not
given an independent position index, and their mi

Inflectional affixes are dealt with like derivational
affixes. The suffix de is a genitive marker in Chi-
nese. It is marked as an &lt; mu &gt; and is assigned an
mi and assigned an mi index that is only meaning-
ful to the word he2gue4 (`contract&apos;). One significant
difference from the treatment of derivational affixes
should be noted. Inflectional affixes do not change
the meanings and syntactic categories of the words

fects as grammatical morphemes, an attribute mh is
added to the stem word units.
5.3 Discontinuous morphological
phenomena
It should be noted that as far as affixes discussed
above are concerned, we could also have them in-
cluded under the &lt; wu &gt; tags of the stems they at-
tach to. The more complicated treatment described
above is in fact motivated by the discontinuous mor-
phological phenomena as shown in the following ex-
amples, which are not attested in our corpus (not
so much because of its small size, but because of its
stylistic bias)

In the first example, an infix le is inserted between
the two characters of the word chz1fan4. As is com-
mon in computational linguistics research on Chi-
nese, the segmentation program &amp;quot;segments&amp;quot; the text
rather &amp;quot;lemmatize&amp;quot;. It outputs three one-charter to-
kens, which, in Chinese, are all valid dictionary en-
tries. The treatment of le (`PERF&apos;) is like de, which
is to be expected. The constituent &amp;quot;word&amp;quot; fan 4 is
separated from its &amp;quot;major&amp;quot; partner chil in the com-
pound word chi1fan4 (&apos;have meal&apos;). It has to be
marked as an &lt; mu &gt; attached to its major partner
(as representative of the whole compound word) in
order not to get into the way of subsequent syntactic
analysis. The meaning of the &lt; wt &gt; is that of the
compound word.
We &amp;quot;lemmatize&amp;quot;, but we take care to make sure
that the original output of the segmentation-tagging
program is recoverable, just in case users of our an-
notated corpus are not happy with our lemmatiza-
tion results.
The second example is even more interesting. The
word is &amp;quot;inflected&amp;quot; form of the two-character dictio-
nary entry gao1xing4 (`happy&apos;). The morphologi-
cal process of reduplication has been applied, and
each of the two characters is repeated to give a
four-character surface form. As the segmentation-
tagging program does not lemmatize and meddle
with the order in which characters occur, its out-
put is (somewhat erroneously) the four-token se-
quence of gaol gaol xing4 xing4. These charac-
ters are all valid dictionary entries in Chinese them-
selves, but they do not &amp;quot;combine&amp;quot; to form the
word gao1gao1xing4xing4, which is obtained from
gaolxing4 by a kind of reduplication. In our anno-
tation scheme, the four characters are one &lt; wt &gt;
(with a number of &lt; mu &gt;&apos;s attached to it. The
original output of the segmentation program is pre-
served.

Linguists generally agree that the chunk from
wu wi = 1 &gt; to &lt;wu wi = 5&gt; is a &amp;quot;subordinate
clause&amp;quot;. but they may disagree about the internal
structure of the clause. In GB/MP, the subordinat-
ing conjunction yinl (&apos;because&apos;) will be the head of
the tree hierarchy as shown below (unnecessary de-
tails skipped):
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.834582">
(yin1 (xing2shi4 bu4 he2 gui1ge2))
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998525">
In HPSG, yinl may be analyzed as a &amp;quot;marker&amp;quot;
or a &amp;quot;preposition&amp;quot; with a sentential complement.
When analyzed as a marker, it will be a dependent
of the verb he2 (&apos;conform&apos;)
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.956638">
((yin1) (xing2shi4) (bu4) he2 (gui1ge2))
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9994076">
When yinl is analyzed as a preposition, it may be
considered the head of the phrase structure. How-
ever, it has been argued within HPSG that the
preposition is a dependent of the verb he2.
The position of the subordinating conjunction in
the syntactic structure of a subordinate clause is
thus different depending on the syntactic theory fol-
lowed. In our annotation, yinl is marked as a sub-
ordinating conjunction (ct = cnj). It is marked as
being governed by the head word he2, for which it
functions somewhat like a marker in HPSG (Pollard
and Sag, 1994).
As we can obviously not claim impartiality for
our analysis, our use of dependency annotation is
of course not a solution to the problem. However,
clearly indicating the dependency relationships in
the parse structure will accentuate the disagreement.
If the other researcher who wants to use our an-
notated corpus happens to favour an analysis that
gives the same dependency relationships as we have
marked in the annotation, then it will be up to him
to flesh up the dependency structure with interme-
diate phrasal nodes according to his grammatical
formalism. More often, the other researcher will
find that the annotated syntactic structure does not
agree completely with his own opinions, it should
then be easier for him to make the necessary trans-
formations if annotation consists only of skeletal de-
pendencies without the complications arising inter-
mediate nodes.

<bodyText confidence="0.999994636363636">
It will be in vain for one to attempt to find parse
structures that are universally accepted. What we
can do, and have done, is to label arcs of our parse
structures with the dependency relation names, thus
leaving the hope alive that our parse structures may
be convertible for use by researchers following other
approaches.
While it will be out of our control whether other
researchers will find our annotated corpora useful,
we will be eager to be able to convert linguistic cor-
pora annotated by other researchers for our own use.

Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999403">
We are giving SGML-based syntactic annotation to
a small corpus of Chinese text as a piloting effort
leading to large-scale syntactic annotation. We are
also investigating the potential of importing and
adapting annotated corpora prepared by researchers
following other approaches. With the experience
gained in this pilot effort, we will try to scale up
to annotate a stylistically more balanced corpus. We
also explore the possibility of making use of resources
prepared by other researchers.

The result is that a &amp;quot;phrase&amp;quot; is indistinguishable from its head word, and the ensemble of a head word and its dependent is a &amp;quot;flat&amp;quot; structure without intermediate phrasal nodes. 3 Dependency-based annotation 3.1 A small text corpus We begin with manually annotating a small corpus, with a plan to scale up with the help of the experience gained. We use a small corpus of Chinese text segmented and tagged using a bigram-based segmentation-tagging tool (Lai et al., 1998). The corpus is two &amp;quot;chapters&amp;quot; of a statute in an East Asian Chinese community (Hong Kong). It contains 4797 tokens produced by the segmentation-tagging tool. Because of its small size, this corpus is stylistically not balanced, which is to be borne in mind. 3.2 SGML-style annotation scheme The annotation scheme is based on SGML (SGML, 1986). Its design is explained with the help of the following example: &lt;pu pi=1&gt; &lt;mu mi=i wu=1&gt;&lt;du tg=hm&gt;&lt;cu&gt;&amp;quot;di4&amp;quot; &lt;wu wi=1 gv=2 fn=nm ct=mx sm=&amp;quot;seventh&amp;quot;› &lt;du tg=mx &gt;&lt;cu&gt;&amp;quot;qi1&amp;quot; &lt;wu wi=2 gv=0 ct=ncl sm=&amp;quot;chapter&amp;quot;› &lt;du tg=cnb&gt;&lt;cu&gt;&amp;quot;zhang1&amp;quot; &lt;/pu&gt; &lt;pu pi=2&gt; &lt;wu wi=1 gv</context>

While one particular approach to syntactic analysis is being followed, dependency annotation facilitates the use of annotated corpora by followers of other approaches. 1 Introduction Major linguistic theories like GB/MP (Chomsky, 1986; Chomsky, 1995), HPSG (Pollard and Sag, 1994) and LFG (Bresnan, 1982) agree to represent syntactic structures in terms of phrase structures, but disagree about what kinds of phrase structures should be assigned to the same linguistic expressions.

However, it has been argued within HPSG that the preposition is a dependent of the verb he2. The position of the subordinating conjunction in the syntactic structure of a subordinate clause is thus different depending on the syntactic theory followed. In our annotation, yinl is marked as a subordinating conjunction (ct = cnj). It is marked as being governed by the head word he2, for which it functions somewhat like a marker in HPSG (Pollard and Sag, 1994). As we can obviously not claim impartiality for our analysis, our use of dependency annotation is of course not a solution to the problem. However, clearly indicating the dependency relationships in the parse structure will accentuate the disagreement. If the other researcher who wants to use our annotated corpus happens to favour an analysis that gives the same dependency relationships as we have marked in the annotation, then it will be up to him to flesh up the dependency structure with intermediate phrasal nodes according to his grammatical formalism. More often, the other researcher will</context>

This approach is different from many works in dependency-based parsing (Hellwig, 1986; Covington, 1990; Courtin and Genthial, 1998; Bourdon et al., 1998) in that the relationship between the governor and all its dependents are immediate and The Academica Sinica (Taipei) Chinese treebank and the LDC Chinese Treebank Project should be noted. no intermediate phrasal nodes are necessary. Similar &amp;quot;flat&amp;quot; syntactic structures have recently been suggested in phrase-structure grammars (Houma et al., 1998; Przepiorkowski, 1999). In preparation for large-scale annotation, we are carrying out manual syntactic annotation of a small Chinese legal text corpus. The text is first processed using a &amp;quot;segmentation&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;tagging&amp;quot; tool (Lai et al., 1992; Lai et al., 1998). The tokens are then subjected to morphological analysis to confirm and adjust word boundaries. Words, as the units that are operated on in syntactic analysis, form the basis of an SGML-based annotation scheme. The annotation scheme also recognizes larger parsing units like phrases and sentences and smaller units like characters and dictionary entries, which m</context>

In a project on syntactic annotation of Chinese corpora, we represent syntactic structures in terms of dependency. We follow an approach (Lai and Huang, 1998a; Lai and Huang, 1999a) to Dependency Grammar (Tesniere, 1959; Gaifman, 1965; Hays, 1964; Robinson, 1970), that requires syntactic dependency to be single-headed and projective. Unlike Dependency Grammar schools that allow multiple-headed and non-projective dependency structures (Hudson, 1984; Mereuk, 1988; Starosta, 1988; Hajieova, 1991), single-headedness and projectivity are maintained in a syntactic skeleton, with reference to which constraints to capture non-projective phenomena in language are anchored. In experimental implementations (Lai and Huang, 1998b; Lai and Huang, 1999b) of this approach, projective syntactic dependency structures are generated subject to the constraints of sub cate</context>

The representation of syntactic relationships in terms of dependency also facilitates the use of the annotated corpus by followers of other approaches. 2 Projective dependency syntax without intermediate phrasal nodes 2.1 Projective syntactic dependency skeleton In Dependency Grammar (Tesniere, 1959), words are linked to one another by asymmetrical governordependent relationships. Syntactic dependency structures are constrained by Robinson (1970) as follows: (1) a. One and only one element is independent. b. All others depend directly on some element. c. No element depends directly on more than one other. 11 d. If A depends directly on B and some element C intervenes between them (in linear order of string), then C depends directly on A or on B or some other intervening element. Robinson requires that a word should not depend on more than one word. She also requires that syntactic dependency structures be projective in the sense that dependency links should not cross one another. For example, the projectivity criterion will be violate</context>

We use a small corpus of Chinese text segmented and tagged using a bigram-based segmentation-tagging tool (Lai et al., 1998). The corpus is two &amp;quot;chapters&amp;quot; of a statute in an East Asian Chinese community (Hong Kong). It contains 4797 tokens produced by the segmentation-tagging tool. Because of its small size, this corpus is stylistically not balanced, which is to be borne in mind. 3.2 SGML-style annotation scheme The annotation scheme is based on SGML (SGML, 1986). Its design is explained with the help of the following example: &lt;pu pi=1&gt; &lt;mu mi=i wu=1&gt;&lt;du tg=hm&gt;&lt;cu&gt;&amp;quot;di4&amp;quot; &lt;wu wi=1 gv=2 fn=nm ct=mx sm=&amp;quot;seventh&amp;quot;› &lt;du tg=mx &gt;&lt;cu&gt;&amp;quot;qi1&amp;quot; &lt;wu wi=2 gv=0 ct=ncl sm=&amp;quot;chapter&amp;quot;› &lt;du tg=cnb&gt;&lt;cu&gt;&amp;quot;zhang1&amp;quot; &lt;/pu&gt; &lt;pu pi=2&gt; &lt;wu wi=1 gv=0 fn=sub ct=nc mh=&amp;quot;de&amp;quot; sm=&amp;quot;contract&amp;quot;› &lt;du tg=ncd&gt;&lt;cu&gt;&amp;quot;he2&amp;quot;&lt;cu&gt;&amp;quot;yue4&amp;quot; &lt;mu mil wu=1&gt;&lt;du tg=ed&gt;&lt;cu&gt;&amp;quot;de&amp;quot; &lt;wu wi=2 gv=0 fn=sub ct=na sm=&amp;quot;form&amp;quot;› &lt;du tg=nad&gt;&lt;cu&gt;&amp;quot;xing2&amp;quot;&lt;cu&gt;&amp;quot;shi4&amp;quot; 12 &lt;/pu&gt; &lt;pu pi=3&gt; &lt;wu wi=1 gv=0 ct=mx sm=&amp;quot;7.1&amp;quot;› &lt;du tg=mx&gt;&lt;cu&gt;7&lt;du tg=&amp;quot;.&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;cu&gt;. &lt;du tg=mx&gt;&lt;cu&gt;1 &lt;/pu&gt; &lt;pu pi=4&gt; &lt;wu wi=1 gv=0 ct=na sm=&amp;quot;form&amp;quot;› &lt;du tg=nad&gt;&lt;cu&gt;&amp;quot;xing2&amp;quot;&lt;cu&gt;</context>
