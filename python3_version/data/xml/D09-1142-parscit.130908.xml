This paper presents an investigation of the
relation between words and their gender in
two gendered languages: German and Ro-
manian. Gender is an issue that has long
preoccupied linguists and baffled language
learners. We verify the hypothesis that
gender is dictated by the general sound
patterns of a language, and that it goes
beyond suffixes or word endings. Exper-
imental results on German and Romanian
nouns show strong support for this hypoth-
esis, as gender prediction can be done with
high accuracy based on the form of the
words.

For speakers of a language whose nouns have no
gender (such as modern English), making the leap
to a language that does (such as German), does
not come easy. With no or few rules or heuris-
tics to guide him, the language learner will try to
draw on the “obvious” parallel between grammat-
ical and natural gender, and will be immediately
baffled to learn that girl – M¨adchen – is neuter in
German. Furthermore, one may refer to the same
object using words with different gender: car can
be called (das) Auto (neuter) or (der) Ragen (mas-
culine). Imagine that after hard work, the speaker
has mastered gender in German, and now wishes
to proceed with a Romance language, for example
Italian or Spanish. He is now confronted with the
task of relearning to assign gender in these new
languages, made more complex by the fact that
gender does not match across languages: e.g. sun
– feminine in German (die Sonne), but masculine
in Spanish (el sol), Italian (il sole) and French (le
soleil); moon – masculine in German (der Mond),
but feminine in Spanish (la luna), Italian (la luna)
and French (la lune). Gender doesn’t even match
within a single language family: travel – mascu-
line in Spanish (el viage) and Italian (il viaggio),
but feminine in Portuguese (a viagem).
Grammatical gender groups nouns in a lan-
guage into distinct classes. There are languages
whose nouns are grouped into more or less than
three classes. English for example has none, and
makes no distinction based on gender, although
Old English did have three genders and some
traces remain (e.g. blonde, blond).
Linguists assume several sources for gender: (i)
a first set of nouns which have natural gender and
which have associated matching grammatical gen-
der; (ii) nouns that resemble (somehow) the nouns
in the first set, and acquire their grammatical gen-
der through this resemblance. Italian and Roma-
nian, for example, have strong and reliable phono-
logical correlates (Vigliocco et al., 2004b, for Ital-
ian). (Doca, 2000, for Romanian). In Romanian
the majority of feminine nouns end in a˘ or e. Some
rules exists for German as well (Schumann, 2006),
for example nouns ending in -t¨at, -ung, -e, -enz,
-ur, -keit, -in tend to be feminine. Also, when
specific morphological processes apply, there are
rules that dictate the gender of the newly formed
word. This process explains why Frau (woman) is
feminine in German, while Fr¨aulein (little woman,
miss) is neuter – Fr¨aulein = Frau + lein. The ex-
isting rules have exceptions, and there are numer-
ous nouns in the language which are not derived,
and such suffixes do not apply.
Words are names used to refer to concepts. The
fact that the same concept can be referred to using
names that have different gender – as is the case
for car in German – indicates that at least in some
cases, grammatical gender is in the name and not
the concept. We test this hypothesis – that the gen-
der of a noun is in its word form, and that this goes
beyond word endings – using noun gender data
for German and Romanian. Both Romanian and
German have 3 genders: masculine, feminine and

neuter. The models built using machine learning
algorithms classify test nouns into gender classes
based on their form with high accuracy. These re-
sults support the hypothesis that in gendered lan-
guages, the word form is a strong clue for gender.
This supplements the situation when some con-
cepts have natural gender that matches their gram-
matical gender: it allows for an explanation where
there is no such match, either directly perceived,
or induced through literary devices.
The present research has both theoretical and
practical benefits. From a theoretical point of
view, it contributes to research on phonology and
gender, in particular in going a step further in un-
derstating the link between the two. From a practi-
cal perspective, such a connection between gender
and sounds could be exploited in advertising, in
particular in product naming, to build names that
fit a product, and which are appealing to the de-
sired customers. Studies have shown that espe-
cially in the absence of meaning, the form of a
word can be used to generate specific associations
and stimulate the imagination of prospective cus-
tomers (Sells and Gonzales, 2003; Bedgley, 2002;
Botton et al., 2002).

What is the origin of grammatical gender and how
does it relate to natural gender? Opinions are split.
Historically, there were two main, opposite, views:
(i) there is a semantic explanation, and natural
gender motivated the category (ii) the relationship
between natural and grammatical gender is arbi-
trary.
Grimm (1890) considered that grammatical
gender is an extension of natural gender brought
on by imagination. Each gender is associated
with particular adjectives or other attributes, and in
some cases (such as for sun and moon) the assign-
ment of gender is based on personification. Brug-
mann (1889) and Bloomfield (1933) took the po-
sition that the mapping of nouns into genders is
arbitrary, and other phenomena – such as deriva-
tions, personification – are secondary to the estab-
lished agreement. Support for this second view
comes also from language acquisition: children
who learn a gendered language do not have a nat-
ural gender attribute that they try to match onto
the newly acquired words, but learn these in a sep-
arate process. Any match or mapping between
natural and grammatical gender is done after the
natural gender “feature” is acquired itself. Ki-
larski (2007) presents a more detailed overview
of currents and ideas about the origin of gender.
Unterbeck (1999) contains a collection of papers
that investigate grammatical gender in several lan-
guages, aspects of gender acquisition and its rela-
tion with grammatical number and agreement.
There may be several reasons for the polemic
between these two sides. One may come from the
categorization process, the other from the relation
between word form and its meaning. Let us take
them each in turn, and see how they influenced
gender.
Grammatical gender separates the nouns in a
language into disjoint classes. As such, it is a cat-
egorization process. The traditional – classical –
theory of categorization and concepts viewed cat-
egories and concepts as defined in terms of a set
of common properties that all its members should
share. Recent theories of concepts have changed,
and view concepts (and categories) not necessar-
ily as “monolithic” and defined through rules, but
rather as clusters of members that may resemble
each other along different dimensions (Margolis
and Laurence, 1999).
In most linguistic circles, the principle of ar-
bitrariness of the association between form and
meaning, formalized by de Saussure (1916) has
been largely taken for granted. It seems however,
that it is hard to accept such an arbitrary relation,
as there have always been contestants of this prin-
ciple, some more categorical than others (Jakob-
son, 1937; Jespersen, 1922; Firth, 1951). It is pos-
sible that the correlation we perceive between the
word form and the meaning is something that has
arisen after the word was coined in a language, be-
ing the result of what Firth called “phonetic habit”
through “an attunement of the nervous system”,
and that we have come to prefer, or select, cer-
tain word forms as more appropriate to the con-
cept they name – “There is no denying that there
are words which we feel instinctively to be ade-
quate to express the ideas they stand for.... Sound
symbolism, we may say, makes some words more
fit to survive” (Jespersen, 1922).
These two principles relate to the discussion
on gender in the following manner: First of all,
the categories determined by grammatical gen-
der need not be homogeneous, and their mem-
bers need not all respect the same member-
ship criterion. This frees us from imposing a
matching between natural and grammatical gen-
der where no such relation is obvious or pos-

sible through literary devices (personification,
metaphor, metonymy). Nouns belonging to the
same gender category may resemble each other
because of semantic considerations, lexical deriva-
tions, internal structure, perceived associations
and so on. Second, the fact that we allow for the
possibility that the surface form of a word may
encode certain word characteristics or attributes,
allows us to hypothesize that there is a surface,
phonological, similarity between words grouped
within the same gender category, that can supple-
ment other resemblance criteria in the gender cat-
egory (Zubin and K¨opcke, 1986).
Zubin and K¨opcke (1981), Zubin and K¨opcke
(1986) have studied the relation between seman-
tic characteristics and word form with respect to
gender for German nouns. Their study was mo-
tivated by two observations: Zipf (1935) showed
that word length is inversely correlated with fre-
quency of usage, and Brown (1958) proposed that
in choosing a name for a given object we are more
likely to use a term corresponding to a “basic”
level concept. For example, chair, dog, apple
would correspond to the basic level, while furni-
ture, animal, fruit and recliner, collie, braeburn
apple correspond to a more general or a more
specific level, respectively. Their study of gen-
der relative to these levels have shown that basic
level terms have masculine, feminine, and rarely
neuter genders, while the more undifferentiated
categories at the superordinate level are almost ex-
clusively neuter.
In psycholinguistic research, Friederici and Ja-
cobsen (1999) adopt the position that a lexical
entry consists of two levels: form and seman-
tic and grammatical properties to study the influ-
ence of gender priming – both from a form and
semantic perspective – on language comprehen-
sion. Vigliocco et al. (2004a) study gender prim-
ing for German word production. While this re-
search studies the influence of the word form on
the production of nouns with the same or different
grammatical gender, there is no study of the rela-
tion between word forms and their corresponding
gender.
In recent studies we have found on the rela-
tion between word form and its associated gender,
the only phonological component of a word that
is considered indicative is the ending. Spalek et
al. (2008) experiment on French nouns, and test
whether a noun’s ending is a strong clue for gen-
der for native speakers of French. Vigliocco et al.
(2004b) test cognitive aspects of grammatical gen-
der of Italian nouns referring to animals.
Cucerzan and Yarowsky (2003) present a boot-
strapping process to predict gender for nouns in
context. They show that context gives accurate
clues to gender (in particular through determiners,
quantifiers, adjectives), but when the context is not
useful, the algorithm can fall back successfully on
the word form. Cucerzan and Yarowsky model
the word form for predicting gender using suffix
trie models. When a new word is encountered, the
word is mapped onto the trie starting from the last
letter, and it is assigned the gender that has the
highest probability based on the path it matches in
the trie. In context nouns appear with various in-
flections – for number and case in particular. Such
morphological derivations are gender specific, and
as such are strong indicators for gender.
The hypothesis tested here is that gender comes
from the general sound of the language, and is dis-
tributed throughout the word. For this, the data
used should not contain nouns with “tell tale” in-
flections. The data will therefore consist of nouns
in the singular form, nominative case. Some nouns
are derived from verbs, adverbs or adjectives, or
other nouns through morphological derivations.
These derivations are regular and are identifiable
through a rather small number of regular suffixes.
These suffixes (when they are indicative of gen-
der) and word endings will be used as baselines
to compare the accuracy of prediction on the full
word with the ending fragment.

We test our gender-language sounds connection
through two languages from different language
families. German will be the representative of the
Germanic languages, and Romanian for the Ro-
mance ones. We first collect data in the two lan-
guages, and then represent them through various
features – letters, pronunciation, phonetic features.

German data For German we collect nouns and
their grammatical gender from a German-English

man nouns and their gender from this dictionary.
In step 2, we filter out compounds. The reason
for this step is that a German noun compound will

have the gender of its head, regardless of its nom-
inal modifiers. For the lack of a freely available
tool to detect and split noun compounds, we resort
to the following algorithm:

<listItem confidence="0.9973775">
1. initialize the list of nouns LN to the empty
list;
2. take each noun n in the dictionary D, and
(a) if Ini E LN such that n is an end sub-
string of ni, then add n to LN and re-
move ni from LN;
(b) if Ini E LN such that ni is a end sub-
string of n, skip n;
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999939722222222">
Essentially, we remove from the data all nouns
that include another noun as the end part (which
is the head position in German noun compounds).
This does not filter examples that have suffixes
added to form the feminine version of a masculine
noun, for example: (der) Lehrer – (die) Lehrerin
(teacher). The suffixes are used in one of the base-
lines for comparison with our learning method.
We obtain noun pronunciation information from
the Bavarian Archive for Speech Signals2. We fil-
ter again our list LN to keep nouns for which we
have pronunciation information. This allows us to
compare the learning results when letter or pro-
nunciation information is used.
After collecting the nouns and their pronunci-
ation, we map the pronunciation onto lower level
phonetic features, following the IPA encoding of
sounds for the German language. The mapping
between sounds and IPA features was manually
encoded following IPA tables.
Romanian data We extract singular nomina-
tive forms of nouns from the Romanian lexical
database (Barbu, 2008). The resource contains
the proper word spelling, including diacritics and
special characters. Because of this and the fact
that there is a straightforward mapping between
spelling and pronunciation in Romanian, we can
use the entire data extracted from the dictionary
in our experiments, without special pronunciation
dictionaries. Following the example for the Ger-
man language, we encode each sound through
lower level phonological features using IPA guide-
lines.
As in Italian, in Romanian there are strong
phonological cues for nouns, especially those hav-
ing the feminine gender: they end in a˘ and e.

To determine whether the connection between a
word form and gender goes beyond this superfi-
cial rule, we generate a dataset in which the nouns
are stripped of their final letter, and their represen-
tation is built based on this reduced form.

Because for Romanian the dataset is rather
large, we can afford to perform undersampling
to balance our classes, and have a more straight-

the neuter classes down to the level of the mascu-
line class. We work then with a dataset of 22014

For each word in our collections we produce three
types of representation: letters, phonemes and
phonological features. Table 2 shows examples
for each of these representations. The letter and
phoneme representations are self-explanatory. We
obtain the pronunciation corresponding to each
word from a pronunciation dictionary, as men-
tioned in Section 3.1, which maps a word onto a
sequence of phonemes (phones). For Romanian
we have no such resource, but me make without
since in most part the pronunciation matches the
letter representation3.

Phonemes, the building blocks of the phonetic
representation, can be further described in terms
of phonological features – “configurations” of
the vocal tract (e.g tongue and lips position),
and acoustic characteristics (e.g. manner of
air flow). We use IPA standards for mapping
phones in German and Romanian onto these
phonological features. We manually construct
a map between phones and features, and then
automatically binarize this representation and
use it to generate a representation for each
phone in each word in the data. For the word
abend (de) / seara (ro) (evening) in Figure 2, the
phonological feature representation for German is:

4 Kernel Methods and String Kernels
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.990712111111111">
Our hypothesis that the gender is in the name is
equivalent to proposing that there are sequences of
letters/sounds/phonological features that are more
common among nouns that share the same gender
or that can distinguish between nouns under differ-
ent genders. To determine whether that is the case,
we use a string kernel, which for a given string (se-
quence) generates a representation that consists of
all its substrings of length less than a parameter l.
The words are represented as strings with bound-
aries marked with a special character (’#’). The
high dimensional representation generated by the
string kernel is used to find a hyperplane that sep-
arates instances of different classes. In this section
we present in detail the kernel we use.
Kernel-based learning algorithms work by em-
bedding the data into a feature space (a Hilbert
space), and searching for linear relations in that
space. The embedding is performed implicitly,
that is by specifying the inner product between
each pair of points rather than by giving their co-
ordinates explicitly.
Given an input set X (the space of examples),
and an embedding vector space F (feature space),
let O : X → F be an embedding map called fea-
ture map.
A kernel is a function k, such that for all x, z ∈
X, k(x, z) =&lt; O(x), O(z) &gt;, where &lt; ., . &gt;
denotes the inner product in F.
In the case of binary classification problems,
kernel-based learning algorithms look for a dis-
criminant function, a function that assigns +1 to
examples belonging to one class and −1 to exam-
ples belonging to the other class. This function
will be a linear function in the space F, that means
it will have the form:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.986007">
f(x) = sign(&lt; w, O(x) &gt; +b),
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.941132833333333">
for some weight vector w. The kernel can be
exploited whenever the weight vector can be ex-
pressed as a linear combination of the training
n
points, i=1 αiO(xi), implying that f can be ex-
pressed as follows:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9675935">
n
f(x) = sign( αik(xi, x) + b)
i=1
.
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999087375">
Various kernel methods differ in the way in
which they find the vector w (or equivalently the
vector α). Support Vector Machines (SVM) try to
find the vector w that define the hyperplane that
maximum separate the images in F of the train-
ing examples belonging to the two classes. Math-
ematically SVMs choose the w and b that satisfy
the following optimization criterion:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.577099">
[1 − yi(&lt; w, O(xi) &gt; +b)]+ + v||w||2
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.975171666666667">

ample xi, v a regularization parameter and [x]+ =

Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR) selects the vec-
tor w that simultaneously has small empirical er-
ror and small norm in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert
Space generated by kernel k. The resulting mini-
mization problem is:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.889431">
(yi− &lt; w, O(xi) &gt;)2 + A||w||2
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998360625">
where again yi is the label (+1/−1) of the training
example xi, and A a regularization parameter. De-
tails about SVM and KRR can be found in (Taylor
and Cristianini, 2004). What is important is that
above optimization problems are solved in such a
way that the coordinates of the embedded points
are not needed, only their pairwise inner products
which in turn are given by the kernel function k.
SVM and KRR produce binary classifiers and
gender classification is a multi-class classification
problem. There are a lot of approaches for com-
bining binary classifiers to solve multi-class prob-
lems. We used one-vs-all scheme. For arguments
in favor of one-vs-all see (Rifkin and Klautau,
2004).
The kernel function offers to the kernel methods
the power to naturally handle input data that are
not in the form of numerical vectors, for example
strings. The kernel function captures the intuitive
notion of similarity between objects in a specific
domain and can be any function defined on the
respective domain that is symmetric and positive
definite. For strings, a lot of such kernel functions
exist with many applications in computational bi-
ology and computational linguistics (Taylor and
Cristianini, 2004).
Perhaps one of the most natural ways to mea-
sure the similarity of two strings is to count how
many substrings of length p the two strings have
in common. This give rise to the p-spectrum ker-
nel. Formally, for two strings over an alphabet E,
s, t ∈ E∗, the p-spectrum kernel is defined as:

where numv(s) is the number of occurrences of
string v as a substring in s 4 The feature map de-
fined by this kernel associate to each string a vec-
tor of dimension |E|p containing the histogram of
frequencies of all its substrings of length p. Taking

We performed 10-fold cross-validation learning
experiments with kernel ridge regression and the
string kernel (KRR-SK) presented in Section 4.
We used several baselines to compare the results
of the experiments against:
BL-R Gender is assigned following the distribu-
tion of genders in the data.
BL-M Gender is assigned following the majority
class (only for German, for Romanian we use
balanced data).
BL-S Gender is assigned based on suffix-gender
relation found in the literature. We use the
following mappings:

tion may be that in both the languages we consid-
ered, there is an (almost) one-to-one mapping be-
tween letters and their pronunciation, making thus
the pronunciation-based representation unneces-
sary. As such, the letter level captures the interest-
ing commonalities, without the need to go down
to the phoneme-level.
We performed experiments for Romanian when
the last letter of the word is removed. The reason
for this batch of experiments is to further test the
hypothesis that gender is more deeply encoded in a
word form than just the word ending. For both lan-
guages we observe statistically significant higher
performance than all baselines. For Romanian,
the last letter heuristic gives a very high baseline,
confirming that Romanian has strong phonologi-
cal cues for gender in the ending. Had the word
ending been the only clue to the word’s gender,

once it is removed the performance on recogniz-
ing gender should be close to the random assign-
ment. This is not the case, and the improvement
over the random baseline is 32% points. It is inter-
esting to notice that when cutting off the last letter
the class for which the gender assignment heuris-
tic was clearest – the feminine class with -˘a and
-e endings – the performance remains very high –
85% F-score.
To further test where the gender indicators are
located, we performed two more sets of experi-
ments: (i) classify words in their corresponding
gender class using the word minus the last N let-
ters; (ii) classify words based on the last N let-
ters. The results of these experiments in terms of
accuracy are presented in Figure 1. When con-
sidering only the last N letters the performance is
high for both German and Romanian, as expected
if the gender indicators are concentrated at the end
of the word. It is interesting though to notice the
results of classification based on the word without
the last N letters. The prediction accuracy mono-
tonically decreases, but remains above the base-
line until more than 6 letters are cut. Because as
letters are cut some words completely disappear,
the baseline changes accordingly. 94.07% of the
words have a length of at most 12 letters in the
Romanian dataset, and 96.07% in the German one.
Because gender prediction can be done with accu-
racy higher than the random baseline even after 6
letters are cut from the ending of the word indicate
that for more than 94% of the words considered,
gender clues are spread over more than the second
half of the word. Again, we remind the reader that
the word forms are in nominative case, with no
case or number inflections (which are strong indi-
cators of gender in both Romanian and German).
Except for lines KRR − SKnoWB, the results
in Table 3 are obtained through experiments con-
ducted on words containing word boundary mark-
ers, as indicated in Section 4. Because of these
markers, word starting or word ending substrings
are distinct from all the others, and information
about their position in the original word is thus
preserved. To further explore the idea that gender
indicators are not located only in word endings,
we ran classification experiments for German and
Romanian when the word representation does not
contain word boundary markers. This means that
the substrings generated by the string kernel have
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999919413043478">
no position information. The results of these ex-
periments are presented in rows KRR−SKnoWB
in Table 3. The accuracy is slightly lower than the
best results obtained when word boundaries are
marked and the entire word form is used. How-
ever, they are well above all the baselines consid-
ered, without no information about word endings.
For both German and Romanian, the gender that
was learned best was feminine. For German part
of this effect is due to the fact that the feminine
class is more numerous in the data. For Roma-
nian the data was perfectly balanced, so there is no
such bias. Neuter and masculine nouns have lower
learning performance. For Romanian, a contri-
bution to this effect is the fact that neuter nouns
behave as masculine nouns in their singular form
(take the same articles, inflections, derivations),
but as feminine in the plural, and our data consists
of nouns in singular form. It would seem that from
an orthographic point of view, neuter and mascu-
line nouns are closer to each other than to feminine
nouns.
From the reviewed related work, the one that
uses the word form to determine gender is
Cucerzan and Yarowsky (2003) for Romanian.
There are two important differences with respect
to the approach presented here. First, they con-
sider words in context, which are inflected for
number and case. Number and case inflections
are reflected in suffixes that are gender specific.
The words considered here are in singular form,
nominative case – as such, with no inflections.
Second, Cucerzan and Yarowsky consider two
classes: feminine vs. masculine and neuter. Mas-
culine and neuter nouns are harder to distinguish,
as in singular form neuter nouns behave like mas-
culine nouns in Romanian. While the datasets and
word forms used by Cucerzan and Yarowsky are
different than the one used here, the reader may
be curious how well the word form distinguishes
between feminine and the other two classes in
the experimental set-up used here. On the full5
Romanian dataset described in Section 3, a two
class classification gives 99.17% accuracy. When
predicting gender for all words in their dataset,
Cucerzan and Yarowsky obtain 98.25% accuracy.

very tempting to try to assign grammatical gen-
der based on perceived or guessed natural gender
types. This does not work out well, and it only
serves to confuse the learner even more, when he
finds out that nouns expressing concepts with clear
feminine or masculine natural gender will have the
opposite or a neutral grammatical gender, or that
one concept can be referred to through names that
have different grammatical genders. Going with
the flow of the language seems to be a better idea,
and allow the sound of a word to dictate the gen-
der.
In this paper we have investigated the hypothe-
sis that gender is encoded in the word form, and
this encoding is more than just the word endings
as it is commonly believed. The results obtained
show that gender assignment based on word form
analysis can be done with high accuracy – 72.36%
for German, and 78.83% for Romanian. Existing
gender assignment rules based on word endings
have lower accuracy. We have further strength-
ened the point by conducting experiments on Ro-
manian nouns without tell-tale word endings. The
accuracy remains high, with remarkably high per-
formance in terms of F-score for the feminine
class (85%). This leads us to believe that gen-
der information is somehow redundantly coded in
a word. We plan to look closer at cases where
we obtain different predictions based on the word
ending and the full form of the word, and use
boosting to learn weights for classifiers based on
different parts of the word to see whether we can
further improve the results.
As we have underlined before, word form simi-
larity between words under the same gender is one
criterion for gender assignment. It would be in-
teresting to verify whether gender recognition can
be boosted by using lexical resources that capture
the semantics of the words, such as WordNets or
knowledge extracted from Wikipedia, and verify
whether similarities from a semantic point of view
are also responsible for gender assignments in var-
ious languages.

Gender is an issue that has long preoccupied linguists and baffled language learners. We verify the hypothesis that gender is dictated by the general sound patterns of a language, and that it goes beyond suffixes or word endings. Experimental results on German and Romanian nouns show strong support for this hypothesis, as gender prediction can be done with high accuracy based on the form of the words.</abstract>

Support for this second view comes also from language acquisition: children who learn a gendered language do not have a natural gender attribute that they try to match onto the newly acquired words, but learn these in a separate process. Any match or mapping between natural and grammatical gender is done after the natural gender “feature” is acquired itself. Kilarski (2007) presents a more detailed overview of currents </context>

Zubin and K¨opcke (1981), Zubin and K¨opcke (1986) have studied the relation between semantic characteristics and word form with respect to gender for German nouns. Their study was motivated by two observations: Zipf (1935) showed that word length is inversely correlated with frequency of usage, and Brown (1958) proposed that in choosing a name for a given object we are more likely to use a term corresponding to a “basic” level concept. For example, chair, dog, apple would correspond to the basic level, while furniture, animal, fruit and recliner, collie, braeburn apple correspond to a more general or a more specific level, respectively. Their study of gender relative to these levels have shown that basic level terms have masculine, feminine, and rarely neuter genders, while the more undifferentiated categories at the superordinate level are almost exclusively neuter.

In recent studies we have found on the relation between word form and its associated gender, the only phonological component of a word that is considered indicative is the ending. Spalek et al. (2008) experiment on French nouns, and test whether a noun’s ending is a strong clue for gender for native speakers of French. Vigliocco et al. (2004b) test cognitive aspects of grammatical gender of Italian nouns referring to animals. Cucerzan and Yarowsky (2003) present a bootstrapping process to predict gender for nouns in context. They show that context gives accurate clues to gender (in particular through determiners, quantifiers, adjectives), but when the context is not useful, the algorithm can fall back successfully on the word form. Cucerzan and Yarowsky model the word form for predicting gender using suffix trie models. When a new word is encountered, the word is mapped onto the trie starting from the last letter, and it is assigned the gender that has the highest probability based on the path it matches in the trie.

Neuter and masculine nouns have lower learning performance. For Romanian, a contribution to this effect is the fact that neuter nouns behave as masculine nouns in their singular form (take the same articles, inflections, derivations), but as feminine in the plural, and our data consists of nouns in singular form. It would seem that from an orthographic point of view, neuter and masculine nouns are closer to each other than to feminine nouns. From the reviewed related work, the one that uses the word form to determine gender is Cucerzan and Yarowsky (2003) for Romanian. There are two important differences with respect to the approach presented here. First, they consider words in context, which are inflected for number and case. Number and case inflections are reflected in suffixes that are gender specific. The words considered here are in singular form, nominative case – as such, with no inflections. Second, Cucerzan and Yarowsky consider two classes: feminine vs. masculine and neuter. Masculine and neuter nouns are harder to distinguish, as in singular form neuter nouns behave like masculine nouns in Romanian. While the datasets and word forms</context>

Linguists assume several sources for gender: (i) a first set of nouns which have natural gender and which have associated matching grammatical gender; (ii) nouns that resemble (somehow) the nouns in the first set, and acquire their grammatical gender through this resemblance. Italian and Romanian, for example, have strong and reliable phonological correlates (Vigliocco et al., 2004b, for Italian). (Doca, 2000, for Romanian).

Some rules exists for German as well (Schumann, 2006), for example nouns ending in -t¨at, -ung, -e, -enz, -ur, -keit, -in tend to be feminine. Also, when specific morphological processes apply, there are rules that dictate the gender of the newly formed word.

SVM and KRR produce binary classifiers and gender classification is a multi-class classification problem. There are a lot of approaches for combining binary classifiers to solve multi-class problems. We used one-vs-all scheme. For arguments in favor of one-vs-all see (Rifkin and Klautau, 2004).

The kernel function captures the intuitive notion of similarity between objects in a specific domain and can be any function defined on the respective domain that is symmetric and positive definite. For strings, a lot of such kernel functions exist with many applications in computational biology and computational linguistics (Taylor and Cristianini, 2004).

While this research studies the influence of the word form on the production of nouns with the same or different grammatical gender, there is no study of the relation between word forms and their corresponding gender. In recent studies we have found on the relation between word form and its associated gender, the only phonological component of a word that is considered indicative is the ending. Spalek et al. (2008) experiment on French nouns, and test whether a noun’s ending is a strong clue for gender for native speakers of French. Vigliocco et al. (2004b) test cognitive aspects of grammatical gender of Italian nouns referring to animals. Cucerzan and Yarowsky (2003) present a bootstrapping process to predict gender for nouns in context. They show that context gives accurate clues to gender (in particular through determiners, quantifiers, adjectives), but when the context is not useful, the algorithm can fall back successfully on the word form.

Details about SVM and KRR can be found in (Taylor and Cristianini, 2004). What is important is that above optimization problems are solved in such a way that the coordinates of the embedded points are not needed, only their pairwise inner products which in turn are given by the kernel function k. SVM and KRR produce binary classifiers and gender classification is a multi-class classification problem. There are a lot of approaches for combining binary classifiers to solve multi-class problems.

Support for this second view comes also from language acquisition: children who learn a gendered language do not have a natural gender attribute that they try to match onto the newly acquired words, but learn these in a separate process. Any match or mapping between natural and grammatical gender is done after the natural gender “feature” is acquired itself. Kilarski (2007) presents a more detailed overview of currents and ideas about the origin of gender. Unterbeck (1999) contains a collection of papers that investigate grammatical gender in several languages, aspects of gender acquisition and its relation with grammatical number and agreement. There may be several reasons for the polemic between these two sides. One may come from the categorization process, the other from the relation between word form and its meaning. Let us take them each in turn, and see how they influenced gender. Grammatical gender separates the nouns in a language into disjoint classes. As such, it is a categorization process.

Second, the fact that we allow for the possibility that the surface form of a word may encode certain word characteristics or attributes, allows us to hypothesize that there is a surface, phonological, similarity between words grouped within the same gender category, that can supplement other resemblance criteria in the gender category (Zubin and K¨opcke, 1986). Zubin and K¨opcke (1981), Zubin and K¨opcke (1986) have studied the relation between semantic characteristics and word form with respect to gender for German nouns. Their study was motivated by two observations: Zipf (1935) showed that word length is inversely correlated with frequency of usage, and Brown (1958) proposed that in choosing a name for a given object we are more likely to use a term corresponding to a “basic” level concept. For example, chair, dog, apple would correspond to the basic level, while furniture, animal, fruit and recliner, collie, braeburn apple correspond to a more general or a more specific level, respectively.
