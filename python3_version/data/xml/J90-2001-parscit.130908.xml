This paper describes a wide-range restructuring of intermediate representations in machine translation,
which is necessary for bridging stylistic gaps between source and target languages and for generating natural
target sentences.
We propose a practical way of designing machine translation systems, based on the transfer method, that
deal with wide-range restructuring. The transfer component should be divided into two separate sub-
components: the wide-range restructuring sub-component and the basic transfer sub-component. The first
sub-component deals specifically with global reorganization of intermediate representations in order to
bridge the stylistic gaps between source and target languages, and the second performs local and straightfor-
ward processing, including lexical transfer and basic structural transfer.
This approach provides us with an effective basis for improving translation quality by systematically
enhancing the transfer rules without sacrificing the clarity and maintainability of the transfer component. It
also guarantees that most of the translation process can be based on the augmented Context Free Grammar
(CFG) formalism and the so-called compositionality principle, by which we can both systematically expand
and maintain linguistic data and design the simplified process control necessary for an efficient machine
translation system.

1 INTRODUCTION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998229375">
Much effort has been devoted to research into, and develop-
ment of, machine translation since the 1950s (Slocum
1985). However, the quality of the output sentences pro-
duced by most machine translation systems is not high
enough to have any marked effect on translation productiv-
ity.
A machine translation system produces a variety of
expressions in the target language, including good, fair, and
poor expressions. In this paper, we define these distinctions
as follows. &amp;quot;Good&amp;quot; sentences can be easily understood and
have high readability because of their naturalness, &amp;quot;fair&amp;quot;
sentences can be understood but their readability is low,
and &amp;quot;poor&amp;quot; sentences cannot be understood without refer-
ring to the source sentences.
To improve the quality of translation, the following
major functions should be implemented:
</bodyText>

1. selection of equivalents for words;
2. reordering of words; and
3. improvement of sentence styles.

<bodyText confidence="0.99959152">
A machine translation system that does not have Func-
tion 3 often produces &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; output in the case of transla-
tion between languages in the same linguistic group if
Functions 1 and 2 are appropriately achieved. However,
most output will be &amp;quot;fair&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;poor&amp;quot; in the case of transla-
tion between languages in different linguistic groups, be-
cause of the stylistic gaps between them. We need to
enhance Function 3 as well as Functions 1 and 2 in order to
change &amp;quot;fair&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;poor&amp;quot; sentences to &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;fair&amp;quot; ones.
Note that in this paper, style means a preferable grammat-
ical form that successfully conveys a correct meaning.
First, let us consider how to select target language
equivalents for words in the source language. An appropri-
ate part of speech for a word is first determined by the
grammatical constraints provided by the analysis gram-
mar. Nouns and the verb in a simple sentence can then be
appropriately translated according to the combinative con-
straints between the case frame of the verb and the seman-
tic markers of the nouns. This is a well-known mechanism
for practical semantic processing in machine translation.
However, this way of selecting equivalents has the limita-
tion that we cannot classify verbs and nouns in sufficient
detail, because of ambiguities in the definitions and usage
of words. Many researchers in machine translation claim
that a much more powerful semantic processing mecha-

nism with a knowledge base is required for this purpose.
This is a long-range research project in the field.
Second, there seem to be few critical problems in reorder-
ing words if structural transfer is appropriately carried out.
In a simple sentence, for example, we can usually reorder
words correctly on the basis of the case frame of the verb.
Thus, the improvement of sentence styles is one of the
crucial functions required for further enhancement of the
present translation quality. Even when the output is &amp;quot;fair&amp;quot;
in quality, it has to be read carefully, because the readabil-
ity is often low. We expect an improvement in sentence
styles to result in an improvement in translation quality
from &amp;quot;poor&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;fair&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;good.&amp;quot; Improving sentence styles
seems to be easier than selecting better equivalents for
words, because there are syntactic clues to help us make the
styles more natural.
This paper focuses on an approach to the improvement of
sentence styles by wide-range restructuring of intermediate
representations. Wide-range restructuring in this paper
means the global restructuring of intermediate representa-
tions, usually including the replacement of some class
words (i.e., noun, adjective, verb, and adverb). Some pa-
pers have mentioned limited restructuring of intermediate
representations (Bennett and Slocum 1985; Vauquois and
Boitet 1985; Isabelle and Bourbeau 1985; Nagao et al.
1985; McCord 1985; Nomura et al. 1986). For example,
LMT (McCord 1985) has a restructuring function after
the transfer phase, to form a bridge between the basic styles
of English and German. The Mu system (Nagao et al.
1985) has two specific restructuring functions, before and
after the transfer phase, mainly to handle exceptional
cases.
However, few machine translation systems have so far
had a comprehensive component for wide-range restructur-
ing (Slocum 1985), mainly because many systems are
presently designed to produce output that is at best &amp;quot;fair,&amp;quot;
and little effort has been devoted to obtaining &amp;quot;good&amp;quot;
output or natural sentences. As a matter of fact, wide-
range restructuring functions are usually scattered over the
analysis, transfer, and generation phases in an ad hoc way.
Because of complicated implementations, the systems come
to have low maintainability and efficiency.
Few papers so far have systematically discussed the
crucial stylistic gaps between languages, the importance of
wide-range restructuring of intermediate representations
to bridge these gaps, and effective mechanisms for restruc-
turing. A restructuring mechanism is necessary even when
a machine translation system is based on the semantic-level
transfer or pivot method (Carbonell etal. 1981).
In this paper, we first discuss stylistic gaps between
languages, and the importance of dealing with them effec-
tively in order to generate natural target sentences. We
then propose a restructuring mechanism that successfully
bridges the stylistic gaps and preserves a high maintainabil-
ity for the transfer phase of a machine translation system.
Last, we discuss the implementation of the wide-range
restructuring function.

2 STYLISTIC GAPS BETWEEN LANGUAGES
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998128">
In discussions on the stylistic gaps between English and
Japanese, it is often said that English is a HAVE-type or
DO-type language, whereas Japanese is a BE-type or BE-
COME-type language. This contrast corresponds to the
differences in the ways people recognize things and express
their ideas about them (Nitta 1986), and hence is consid-
ered as a difference of viewpoint. Idioms and metaphors are
heavily dependent upon each society and culture, and we
sometimes have to reinterpret them to give an appropriate
translation. Each language also has its own specific func-
tion word constructions, which are used to express specific
meanings. These specific constructions cannot be directly
translated into other languages.
We categorize the major stylistic gaps as follows: (1)
stylistic gaps in viewpoint, (2) stylistic gaps in idioms and
metaphors, (3) stylistic gaps in specific constructions using
function words, and (4) others. We will discuss these gaps
in more detail in the case of English-to-Japanese transla-
tion by referring to examples extracted from the literature
(Bekku 1979; Anzai 1983) and slightly modified for our
purpose. In each example, the first sentence is the original
English and the second one is an equivalent or a rough
equivalent in Japanese-like English, which will help us
recognize the stylistic gaps, though some of the rewritten
English is not strictly acceptable.

<bodyText confidence="0.9846075">
The following are some examples of stylistic gaps due to
differences of viewpoint.

<listItem confidence="0.965695857142857">
1. Inanimate noun + transitive verb
i) Inanimate noun + have
(1-a) The room has two tables.

ii) Others
(2-a) This chapter contains the explanation.
(2-b) The explanation is contained in this chapter.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9836935">
The meaning of (1-a) is that the room contains two
tables. However, an inanimate subject for the verb have is
not allowed in Japanese. Japanese usually expresses the
same fact as in (1-b), without using an inanimate subject.
(2-a) and (2-b) show a case in which the voice is changed to
avoid an inanimate subject in a Japanese sentence.

2. Gerund (intransitive verb) + of + noun + transitive
verb
(3-a) The humming of insects reminded me of autumn.
(3-b) Because insects were humming, it seemed to me it
was autumn.
This case is similar to example (1-a) in that the subject of
(3-a) is inanimate. An event or action, which may be the
subject of an English sentence, is usually treated as a cause
or reason in a Japanese sentence.

(4-a) The support allows you to write IPL procedures.

2.2 STYLISTIC GAPS IN IDIOMS AND METAPHORS
</subsectionHeader>

Idioms and metaphors should be distinguished from other
phrases in a text, because they have implicit and fixed
meanings. The following are some examples:

(11-a) He burned his bridges.
(11-b) He destroyed his alternative options.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9992128">
In case (9-a), we will face difficulty in semantic process-
ing if we try to translate the sentence directly. The reason is
that the verb drink usually requires an animate subject
whereas the noun car is, in most cases, classified as an
inanimate thing.

We can translate example (10-a) literally if we want to
preserve the humor conveyed by the original sentence.

differences. Example (11-a) is a typical case of something
that we cannot translate literally into Japanese.

above, because the grammatical functions conveyed by the
special constructions using function words are often ex-
pressed in a very different way in a target language.

2.4 OTHERS

<bodyText confidence="0.999981823529412">
In addition to the stylistic gaps described above, we often
see other stylistic gaps based on the meaning of a word. For
example, the verb bridge in English should be translated by
&amp;quot;hashi (a noun meaning a bridge) wo (a case particle
meaning an object) kakeru (a verb meaning &apos;install&apos;)&amp;quot; in
Japanese. One English verb corresponds to a noun, a case
particle, and a verb in this case. A set of consecutive words
may have a fixed meaning: for example, a number of can be
considered as many in most cases. Differences in tense,
aspect, and modality are also related to stylist gaps between
languages, although we do not discuss these in detail here.
So far, we have discussed four types of stylistic gaps.
Generally, there are larger stylistic gaps between lan-
guages belonging to different groups than between lan-
guages in the same group. It is clear that if we can deal
adequately with these stylistic gaps, we can further im-
prove translation quality.

the whole process into three phases: analysis of the source
language, transfer between intermediate representations,
and generation of the target language. The basic concept
underlying current machine translation technology is the
compositionality principle (Nagao 1986). The original
idea of the principle is that the meaning of a sentence can
be assembled from the meaning of each of its constituents
and, moreover, that the assembling process can be imple-
mented by assembling the forms or syntax that convey the
meanings. Montague grammar is one of the theoretical
bases of the principle, and some work applying Montague
grammar to machine translation has been reported (Lands-
bergen 1982; Nishida and Doshita 1983). If the composi-
tionality principle is applied to machine translation, we
expect that it will be possible to translate a whole sentence
by translating each word individually and then appropri-
ately composing all the translated words.
For example, let us consider the following two sentences,
which have the same meaning.
S: I drink water. (English)
JS: watashi ha mizu wo nomu. (Japanese)
(I) (water) (drink)
Let us assume that the above sentences have the syntac-
tic structures shown in Figure 1 (a) and (b), based on the
grammars shown in (c) and (d), respectively. Note that the
parentheses in the right-hand side of the last rule in (d)
denote a condition that must be met in applying the rule.
These structures are also considered to be the intermediate
structures (i.e. the source structure and target structure) in
the transfer phase of machine translation.
The ideal machine translation based on the composition-
ality principle ensures that structure (a) is successfully
transferred to structure (b) by applying the transfer rules,
as shown in Figure 2.
In Figure 2, the transfer rules are symbolized for conve-
nience. The left-hand sides of the rules consist of matching
patterns that correspond to the grammar of the English

sentence, and the right-hand sides consist of target patterns
that correspond to the grammar of the target Japanese
sentence.
The steps of the transfer process using these transfer
rules are shown in Figure 3. This transfer process is done
entirely in a bottom-up and left-to-right manner by using
the transfer rules, and is based on the compositionality
principle. The process is simple, easy to control, and easy to
implement efficiently.
Let us consider the stylistic gaps mentioned in the previ-
ous section. To bridge such gaps, we need to replace some
words with new words and perform restructuring widely. It
is important to recognize that the words involved in the
replacement are class words (i.e. noun, adjective, verb, and
adverb) rather than function words (i.e. preposition, auxil-
iary verb, conjunction, relative pronoun, particle, etc.), as
shown in the examples of types 2.1 and 2.2. For example, in
cases (6-a) and (6-b), good is replaced by well and speaker
is replaced by speaks. In cases (10-a) and (10-b), are time
bombs is replaced by gradually harm us. On the other
hand, most words involved in the replacement are function
words in the examples of type 2.3. For example, in cases
(13-a) and (13-b 1 ), so and that are replaced by because
and very much.
The above-mentioned framework based on the composi-
tionality principle cannot provide appropriate treatment
for stylistic gaps of types 2.1 and 2.2, because wide-range
structure handling, as well as the replacement of some class
words, is necessary instead of the local and bottom-up
structure handling that includes some treatment of func-
tion words. For type 2.3, the above framework does not suit

the treatment of the gaps if the transfer is done at the
analysis-tree level and some function words exist in the
source structure for the transfer. It is not difficult to handle
gaps of type 2.4 except for those caused by tense, aspect,
and modality, because they can be bridged only by local
treatment of constituents instead of wide-range restructur-
ing. For example, if a system finds the consecutive words a
number of in a sentence, the system can exceptionally treat
it as one word meaning many in the previous framework. It
is normally translated by replacing it with a target-
language equivalent.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999512">
3.2 TWO-STEP TRANSFER METHOD
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.985213642857143">
To deal with stylistic gaps effectively in a system based on
the transfer method, we propose the incorporation of a
specific sub-component for wide-range restructuring of the
intermediate structures in the transfer component, as shown
in Figure 4. This gives an example of a system configura-
tion for English-to-Japanese machine translation. The ba-
sic transfer consists of lexical transfer and reordering of
words.
The wide-range restructuring should be done after anal-
ysis of the input sentence and before the basic transfer. We
take advantage of syntactic clues given in the intermediate
representation for effective restructuring after analysis of
the input. The wide-range restructuring, which changes the
global structure as well as some class words of the sentence,
should be performed not after but before the basic transfer,
for the following reasons.
1. The restructuring makes the basic transfer easier and it
also reduces the transfer rules, because it often contrib-
utes to standardization or limitation of English sentence
styles, as discussed in more detail in Section 3.3
2. The restructuring is not affected by transfer errors,
which often occur because of the complexity of the
transfer process.
By means of this restructuring sub-component, the inter-
mediate representation of the input sentence is transformed
or reinterpreted from a source-dependent expression into a
target-dependent one. We can define augmented CFGs for
analysis and generation in this framework. If we design the

rule appropriately and control for the wide-range restruc-
turing sub-component, the output structures of both the
sub-component and the basic transfer sub-component can
be defined by using augmented CFGs that deal with condi-
tions for rule applications. In other words, the basic trans-
fer sub-component can specialize in transfer from one
augmented CFG system to another, as illustrated in Figure
2.
Because wide-range restructuring, which does not suit
the compositionality principle, can be performed entirely in
the restructuring sub-component, and because the basic
transfer can be simplified and specialized in local and
bottom-up treatments of structures based on the aug-
mented CFG formalism, as mentioned above, all the pro-
cesses of machine translation except wide-range restructur-
ing can be based on the augmented CFG formalism or the
compositionality principle. This approach makes the whole
system simple, easy to control, and efficient.
If a machine translation system uses analysis-tree struc-
tures as intermediate structures (Lehmann et al. 1981;
Nitta et al. 1982), wide-range restructuring can be intro-
duced appropriately at the surface level. If the system
performs deep analysis of the input sentence and creates a
semantic representation such as a frame-like structure or a
semantic network as an intermediate representation, wide-
range restructuring may be required at the deep level. This
is true whenever we handle stylistic gaps of types 2.1 and
2.2. However, gaps of type 2.3 can be handled by analysis,
and no wide-range restructuring is required from the sys-
tem that performs deep analysis of the input sentence.

3.3 ADVANTAGE OF THE TWO-STEP TRANSFER
METHOD OVER THE SINGLE-STEP TRANSFER METHOD
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999313916666667">
Let us discuss the advantage of this approach over the
conventional single-step transfer method from the stand-
point of maintainability.
Technical documents contain many variants of sentence
patterns. The examples in Section 2 are regarded as vari-
ants from the viewpoint of English-to-Japanese translation.
As a matter of fact, several different English sentences in
an English technical document can often be translated by
the same Japanese sentence. In other words, a wide variety
of expression in English can be reduced to some extent in
Japanese, because the most important concern in technical
documents is that each sentence should convey technical
information correctly. Therefore, we may standardize or
control styles of English sentences for the sake of English-
to-Japanese translation.
The two-step transfer method including wide-range re-
structuring is an appropriate way to take advantage of this
phenomenon. If we encounter a new variant of a sentence
pattern in English, we only have to write an English
restructuring rule in the case of the two-step transfer
method. On the other hand, a whole transfer rule, which is
usually harder to write, is needed in the single-transfer
method. If we want to modify a target Japanese sentence
that corresponds to some English sentences, we only have to

modify the corresponding basic transfer rule, instead of
modifying all the transfer rules for these English sentences.
Consequently, it is easier to maintain the transfer rules if
the system is based on the two-step transfer method, espe-
cially in translating technical documents.

4 IMPLEMENTATION OF THE WIDE-RANGE
RESTRUCTURING FUNCTION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99967375">
A prototype English-to-Japanese machine translation sys-
tem, SHALT (Tsutsumi 1986), is based on the two-step
transfer method described in Section 3.2. So far we have
developed about 500 wide-range restructuring rules to cope
with the stylistic gaps exemplified in Section 2, and we have
confirmed the effectiveness of the restructuring through
test translation of a few IBM computer manuals.
In this section, we discuss the details of the rules for the
wide-range restructuring and their applications in SHALT,
as an example. SHALT is implemented in LISP, and the
English and Japanese intermediate representations are syn-
tactic-analysis tree structures.

AND THEIR APPLICATIONS
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999956571428571">
A wide-range restructuring rule consists of a pair of a
matching pattern and a target pattern. If an input English
tree structure matches a matching pattern, then a target
Japanese-like English tree structure is generated according
to specifications in a target pattern. A matching pattern is
defined as follows. Note that * allows repetition of specifica-
tions.

STRUCTURE specifies the tree structure to be checked.
If 0 is specified, the whole input structure is treated. If
MATCHING-VARIABLE is specified, its value (i.e. part
of a structure), which has already been set by MATCH-
ING-ELEMENTs in an earlier matching process, is a
target for checking. A sequence of MATCHING-ELE-
MENTs checks a sequence of daughter tree structures. If
specified MATCHING-CONDITIONs match a structure,
a specified MATCHING-VARIABLE is set to the struc-
ture. If a MATCHING-ELEMENT is a mere MATCH-
ING-VARIABLE, any structure or nil can be set for the
variable. MATCHING-CONDITION specifies a LISP
function and its arguments. LISP functions check parts of
speech, terminal symbols, or other information of a struc-
ture. All specifications in a matching pattern form AND
conditions, except arguments of LISP functions, which
form OR conditions.
A target pattern specifies the required output structure
by using MATCHING-VARIABLEs where structures are
already set and by adding new structures.
Figure 5 shows an example of a wide-range restructuring
rule arid its application. Figure 5 (a) shows the output of
English analysis, which is the input for wide-range restruc-
turing. Figure 5 (b) shows a wide-range restructuring rule
and (c) gives the output of the restructuring.
The left-hand side of the restructuring rule is a matching
pattern, and the right-hand side of the rule is a target
pattern in Figure 5 (b). Numbers preceded by *, such as *1,
*2, and *3, denote MATCHING-VARIABLEs. There are
four specifications of (STRUCTURE - (MATCHING-
ELEM ENT*)) in the matching pattern, such as (0 - (*1
( *2 (T &amp;quot;it&amp;quot; )) *3 . . . *7)) and (*6 - (*8 (*9
(P ADJ)) . . . *11)). A MATCHING-CONDITION
(T &amp;quot;it&apos;&amp;quot;) in the matching pattern denotes that the terminal
symbol of the tree should be &amp;quot;it.&amp;quot; (P ADJ) denotes that the
part of speech of the root node should be ADJ (i.e.,
adjective). T and P are the LISP function names to perform
these specific checks.
The target pattern in Figure 5 (b) specifies that the
values of MATCHING-VARIABLEs *1, *14, *19, *3, *5,

*9, and *7 should be used and that some new tree structure
should be added to form the output tree structure. We can
directly specify the output tree structure by using parenthe-
ses &amp;quot;(&amp;quot;and&amp;quot;),&amp;quot; and node names, such as VP and COMPL.
LISP functions can also be specified to generate new ele-
ments. LISP function names are distinguished by a preced-
ing &amp;quot;!,&amp;quot; as in !SN. (!SN NP) results in a new node name,
NPXXX (XXX is a unique number in a LISP environ-
ment) for identification. (!APP-TERM &amp;quot;BJ-&amp;quot; *9) denotes
that a new symbol concatenating &amp;quot;BJ-&amp;quot; and the value of *9
should be created. &amp;quot;BJ-important&amp;quot; in Figure 5 (c) means
that &amp;quot;important&amp;quot; in this case should be treated as a predica-
tive adjective.
These specifications for the wide-range restructuring
rules were found to be user-friendly in our experience of
developing a practically sized rule set.
The wide-range restructuring rules are categorized into
about 20 groups according to their functions. This categori-
zation is more detailed than the one described in Section 2.
These groups and rules in each group are arranged sequen-
tially so that more specific and local rules can come earlier
when they are checked. Checking and application of these
rules are done along an input tree in top-down and left-to-
right manner. If one of the rules in a group has successfully
been applied to an input tree, then the rest of the rules in
the same group are no longer checked, and the process goes
to the next rule group. After all the groups have been
checked and applied to the input tree, the process goes to
the next daughter tree of the input tree. When the process
goes to a new tree, the system checks the category name of
its root node and thus avoids useless checking of the tree.
Because all the rules are used in a fixed sequence, they can
be easily maintained.
Figure 6 shows the output of the basic transfer that
follows the process of the wide-range restructuring . As we
compare the output of the wide-range restructuring, which
is the input of the basic transfer, in Figure 5 (c) with the
tree structure in Figure 6, we can see how the basic transfer
is done. For example, sub-trees COMPL, NP3, VERB2,
NP2, VP, and VERB3 in Figure 5 (c) are transferred to
sub-trees JANOUN, JNPPART3, JVP2, JNPPART2,
JNC, and JVP3 in Figure 6, respectively. This example
shows that the basic transfer is more straightforward and
localized than the wide-range restructuring.

<bodyText confidence="0.999989304347826">
Let us discuss example (5-a) in Section 2. The wide-range
restructuring rule is as follows. If the main verb is have and
the head noun (rate) of the object is a two-place predicate
and there is an adjective (low) that modifies the head noun,
then restructure it as shown in (5-b). If the head noun of
the object is classified as &amp;quot;ATTRIBUTE,&amp;quot; the restructur-
ing is obligatory. Otherwise, translation without this restruc-
turing is not very good, but acceptable.
The restructuring rule for case (1-a) in Section 2 is
slightly complicated because we need richer information,
such as (room contains table), so as to restructure (1-a)
into the form `NP1 be in NP2.&apos; If the input is The table has
four legs, it will be restructured differently into the form
Four legs exist for the table because of the above con-
straint. This is not standard English, but it is very similar in
form to Japanese.
We have not yet implemented a way of using semantic
information, such as (room contains table), as constraint,
because the desired restructuring can be done on the basis
of syntactic restrictions in the field of IBM computer
manuals. However, the approach proposed in this paper can
be augmented to handle semantic information without any
crucial problems, if we prepare a knowledge base.

5 CONCLUSIONS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999984222222222">
In this paper, we discuss the importance of treating stylistic
gaps between languages and methods of doing so. A compre-
hensive wide-range restructuring that can cope with stylis-
tic gaps is indispensable for improving the quality of trans-
lation, especially between languages from different linguistic
groups, such as English and Japanese.
We propose a practical way of designing machine trans-
lation systems. The transfer component should be divided
into two separate sub-components: the wide-range restruc-
turing sub-component and the basic transfer sub-compo-
nent. Because the first of these deals with global reorganiza-
tion of the intermediate representations, usually including
the replacement of some class words, the second only has to
do local, straightforward processing. This approach makes
the transfer component much clearer and more maintain-
able than the conventional single-step transfer method. It
also guarantees that, except for the wide-range restructur-
ing sub-component, all of the translation process can be
based on the augmented CFG formalism and the composi-
tionality principle. The ease of controlling the process
makes the system efficient, which is crucial for the develop-
ment of a practical machine translation system.
As a future direction, it will be necessary for us to pursue
a thorough contrastive study of several languages, in terms
of semantics as well as syntax. This will enable us to build
more effective rules for restructuring that will further
improve the quality of machine translation.

We propose a practical way of designing machine translation systems, based on the transfer method, that deal with wide-range restructuring. The transfer component should be divided into two separate subcomponents: the wide-range restructuring sub-component and the basic transfer sub-component. The first sub-component deals specifically with global reorganization of intermediate representations in order to bridge the stylistic gaps between source and target languages, and the second performs local and straightforward processing, including lexical transfer and basic structural transfer. This approach provides us with an effective basis for improving translation quality by systematically enhancing the transfer rules without sacrificing the clarity and maintainability of the transfer component. It also guarantees that most of the translation process can be based on the augmented Context Free Grammar (CFG) formalism and the so-called compositionality principle, by which we can both systematically expand and maintain linguistic data and design the simplified process control necessary for an efficient machine translation system.</abstract>

Each language also has its own specific function word constructions, which are used to express specific meanings. These specific constructions cannot be directly translated into other languages. We categorize the major stylistic gaps as follows: (1) stylistic gaps in viewpoint, (2) stylistic gaps in idioms and metaphors, (3) stylistic gaps in specific constructions using function words, and (4) others. We will discuss these gaps in more detail in the case of English-to-Japanese translation by referring to examples extracted from the literature (Bekku 1979; Anzai 1983) and slightly modified for our purpose. In each example, the first sentence is the original English and the second one is an equivalent or a rough equivalent in Japanese-like English, which will help us recognize the stylistic gaps, though some of the rewritten English is not strictly acceptable. 2.1 STYLISTIC GAPS IN VIEWPOINT The following are some examples of stylistic gaps due to differences of viewpoint. 1.

The basic concept underlying current machine translation technology is the compositionality principle (Nagao 1986). The original idea of the principle is that the meaning of a sentence can be assembled from the meaning of each of its constituents and, moreover, that the assembling process can be implemented by assembling the forms or syntax that convey the meanings. Montague grammar is one of the theoretical bases of the principle, and some work applying Montague grammar to machine translation has been reported (Landsbergen 1982; Nishida and Doshita 1983). If the compositionality principle is applied to machine translation, we expect that it will be possible to translate a whole sentence by translating each word individually and then appropriately composing all the translated words. For example, let us consider the following two sentences, which have the same meaning. S: I drink water. (English) JS: watashi ha mizu wo nomu. (Japanese) (I) (water) (drink) Let us assume that the above sentences have the syntactic structures shown in Figure 1 (a) and (b), based on the grammars shown in (c) and (d), respectively.

This approach makes the whole system simple, easy to control, and efficient. If a machine translation system uses analysis-tree structures as intermediate structures (Lehmann et al. 1981; Nitta et al. 1982), wide-range restructuring can be introduced appropriately at the surface level. If the system performs deep analysis of the input sentence and creates a semantic representation such as a frame-like structure or a semantic network as an intermediate representation, widerange restructuring may be required at the deep level. This is true whenever we handle stylistic gaps of types 2.1 and 2.2. However, gaps of type 2.3 can be handled by analysis, and no wide-range restructuring is required from the system that performs deep analysis of the input sentence. 3.3 ADVANTAGE OF THE </context>

For example, let us consider the following two sentences, which have the same meaning. S: I drink water. (English) JS: watashi ha mizu wo nomu.

We then propose a restructuring mechanism that successfully bridges the stylistic gaps and preserves a high maintainability for the transfer phase of a machine translation system. Last, we discuss the implementation of the wide-range restructuring function. 2 STYLISTIC GAPS BETWEEN LANGUAGES In discussions on the stylistic gaps between English and Japanese, it is often said that English is a HAVE-type or DO-type language, whereas Japanese is a BE-type or BECOME-type language. This contrast corresponds to the differences in the ways people recognize things and express their ideas about them (Nitta 1986), and hence is considered as a difference of viewpoint. Idioms and metaphors are heavily dependent upon each society and culture, and we sometimes have to reinterpret them to give an appropriate translation. Each language also has its own specific function word constructions, which are used to express specific meanings. These specific constructions cannot be directly translated into other languages. We categorize the major stylistic gaps as follows: (1) stylistic gaps in viewpoint, (2) stylistic gaps in idioms and metaphors, (3) stylistic gaps in specific constructions using function words, an</context>

This approach makes the whole system simple, easy to control, and efficient. If a machine translation system uses analysis-tree structures as intermediate structures (Lehmann et al. 1981; Nitta et al. 1982), wide-range restructuring can be introduced appropriately at the surface level. If the system performs deep analysis of the input sentence and creates a semantic representation such as a frame-like structure or a semantic network as an intermediate representation, widerange restructuring may be required at the deep level. This is true whenever we handle stylistic gaps of types 2.1 and 2.2. However, gaps of type 2.3 can be handled by analysis, and no wide-range restructuring is required from the system that performs deep analysis of the input sentence. 3.3 ADVANTAGE OF THE TWO-STEP TRANSFER ME</context>

It also guarantees that most of the translation process can be based on the augmented Context Free Grammar (CFG) formalism and the so-called compositionality principle, by which we can both systematically expand and maintain linguistic data and design the simplified process control necessary for an efficient machine translation system. 1 INTRODUCTION Much effort has been devoted to research into, and development of, machine translation since the 1950s (Slocum 1985). However, the quality of the output sentences produced by most machine translation systems is not high enough to have any marked effect on translation productivity. A machine translation system produces a variety of expressions in the target language, including good, fair, and poor expressions. In this paper, we define these distinctions as follows. &amp;quot;Good&amp;quot; sentences can be easily understood and have high readability because of their naturalness, &amp;quot;fair&amp;quot; sentences can be understood but their readability is low, and &amp;quot;poor&amp;quot; sentences cannot be understood without referring to the source sentences.</context>

So far, we have discussed four types of stylistic gaps. Generally, there are larger stylistic gaps between languages belonging to different groups than between languages in the same group. It is clear that if we can deal adequately with these stylistic gaps, we can further improve translation quality. 3 How TO DEAL WITH STYLISTIC GAPS This section discusses a framework for dealing with the stylistic gaps we noted in the previous section. 3.1 THE COMPOSITIONALITY PRINCIPLE IN MACHINE TRANSLATION Most machine translation systems (Slocum 1985) aiming at practical use employ the transfer method, which divides 73 Taijiro Tsutsumi Intermediate Representations in Machine Translation the whole process into three phases: analysis of the source language, transfer between intermediate representations, and generation of the target language.

So far we have developed about 500 wide-range restructuring rules to cope with the stylistic gaps exemplified in Section 2, and we have confirmed the effectiveness of the restructuring through test translation of a few IBM computer manuals. In this section, we discuss the details of the rules for the wide-range restructuring and their applications in SHALT, as an example. SHALT is implemented in LISP, and the English and Japanese intermediate representations are syntactic-analysis tree structures. 4.1 WIDE-RANGE RESTRUCTURING</context>
