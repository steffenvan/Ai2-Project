Prepositions1—as well as prepositional phrases (PPs) and markers of various sorts—
have a mixed history in computational linguistics (CL), as well as related fields such as
artificial intelligence, information retrieval (IR), and computational psycholinguistics:
On the one hand they have been championed as being vital to precise language un-
derstanding (e.g., in information extraction), and on the other they have been ignored
on the grounds of being syntactically promiscuous and semantically vacuous, and
relegated to the ignominious rank of “stop word” (e.g., in text classification and IR).
Although NLP in general has benefitted from advances in those areas where prepo-
sitions have received attention, there are still many issues to be addressed. For example,
in machine translation, generating a preposition (or “case marker” in languages such
as Japanese) incorrectly in the target language can lead to critical semantic divergences
over the source language string. Equivalently in information retrieval and information
extraction, it would seem desirable to be able to predict that book on NLP and book about
NLP mean largely the same thing, but paranoid about drugs and paranoid on drugs suggest
very different things.
Prepositions are often among the most frequent words in a language. For example,
based on the British National Corpus (BNC; Burnard 2000), four out of the top-ten
most-frequent words in English are prepositions (of, to, in, and for). In terms of both
parsing and generation, therefore, accurate models of preposition usage are essential to
avoid repeatedly making errors. Despite their frequency, however, they are notoriously
difficult to master, even for humans (Chodorow, Tetreault, and Han 2007). For example,
Lindstromberg (2001) estimates that less than 10% of upper-level English as a Second

Language (ESL) students can use and understand prepositions correctly, and Izumi et al.
(2003) reported error rates of English preposition usage by Japanese speakers of up
to 10%.
The purpose of this special issue is to showcase recent research on prepositions
across the spectrum of computational linguistics, focusing on computational syntax and
semantics. More importantly, however, we hope to reignite interest in the systematic
treatment of prepositions in applications. To this end, this article is intended to present
a cross-section view of research on prepositions and their use in NLP applications. We
begin by outlining the syntax of prepositions and its relevance to NLP applications,
focusing on PP attachment and prepositions in multiword expressions (Section 2). Next,
we discuss formal and lexical semantic aspects of prepositions, and again their rele-
vance to NLP applications (Section 3), and describe instances of applied research where
prepositions have featured prominently (Section 4). Finally, we outline the contributions
of the papers included in this special issue (Section 5) and conclude with a discussion of
research areas relevant to prepositions which we believe are ripe for further exploration
(Section 6).

2. Syntax
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999844666666667">
There has been a tendency for prepositions to be largely ignored in the area of syntactic
research as “an annoying little surface peculiarity” (Jackendoff 1973, page 345). In com-
putational terms, the two most important syntactic considerations with prepositions
are: (1) selection (Fillmore 1968; Bennett 1975; Tseng 2000; Kracht 2003), and (2) valence
(Huddleston and Pullum 2002).
Selection is the property of a preposition being subcategorized/specified by the
governor (usually a verb) as part of its argument structure. An example of a selected
preposition is with in dispense with introductions, where introductions is the object of the
verb dispense, but must be realized in a prepositional phrase headed by with (c.f. *dispense
introductions). Conventionally, selected prepositions are specified uniquely (e.g., dispense
with) or as well-defined clusters (e.g., chuckle over/at), and have bleached semantics.
Selected prepositions contrast with unselected prepositions, which do not form part
of the argument structure of a governor and do have semantic import (e.g., live in
Japan). Unsurprisingly, there is not a strict dichotomy between selected and unselected
prepositions (Tseng 2000). For example, in the case of rely on Kim, on is specified in
the argument structure of rely but preserves its directional semantics; similarly, in put it
down, put requires a locative adjunct (c.f. *put it) but is entirely agnostic as to its identity,
and the preposition is semantically transparent.
Preposition selection is important in any NLP application that operates at the
syntax–semantics interface, that is, that overtly translates surface strings onto semantic
representations, or vice versa (e.g., information extraction or machine translation using
some form of interlingua). It forms a core component of subcategorization learning
(Manning 1993; Briscoe and Carroll 1997; Korhonen 2002), and poses considerable chal-
lenges when developing language resources with syntactico-semantic mark-up (Kipper,
Snyder, and Palmer 2004).
Prepositions can occur with either intransitive or transitive valence. Intransitive
prepositions (often referred to as “particles”) are valence-saturated, and as such do not
take arguments. They occur most commonly as: (a) components of larger multiword
expressions (e.g., verb particle constructions, such as pick it up), (b) copular predicates
(e.g., the doctor is in), or (c) prenominal modifiers (e.g., an off day). Transitive prepositions,

on the other hand, select for (usually noun phrase) complements to form PPs (e.g., at
home). The bare term “preposition” traditionally refers to a transitive preposition, but in
this article is used as a catch-all for prepositions of all valences.

<bodyText confidence="0.972135470588235">
Preposition valence has received relatively little direct exposure in the NLP liter-
ature but has been a latent feature of all work on part of speech (POS) tagging and
parsing over the Penn Treebank (Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz 1993), as the
Penn POS tagset distinguishes between transitive prepositions (IN), selected intransitive
prepositions (RP), and unselected intransitive prepositions (RB, along with a range of
other adverbials).2 There have been only isolated cases of research where a dedicated
approach has been used to distinguish between these three sub-usages, in the interests
of optimizing overall POS tagging or parsing performance (Shaked 1993; Toutanova and
Manning 2000; Klein and Manning 2003; MacKinlay and Baldwin 2005).
Two large areas of research on the syntactic aspects of prepositions are (a) PP-
attachment and (b) prepositions in multiword expressions, which are discussed in the
following sections. Although this article will focus largely on the syntax of preposi-
tions in English, prepositions in other languages naturally have their own challenges.
Notable examples which have been the target of research in computational linguistics
are adpositions in Estonian (Muischnek, M¨u¨urisep, and Puolakainen 2005), adpositions
in Finnish (Lestrade 2006), short and long prepositions in Polish (Tseng 2004), and the
French a` and de (Abeill´e et al. 2003).

2.1 PP Attachment
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.874073">
PP attachment is the task of finding the governor for a given PP. For example, in the
following sentence:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.883513">
(1) Kim eats pizza with chopsticks
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.679744">
there is syntactic ambiguity, with the PP with chopsticks being governed by either the
noun pizza (i.e., as part of the NP pizza with chopsticks, as indicated in Example (2)), or
the verb eats (i.e., as a modifier of the verb, as indicated in Example (3)).

Of these, the latter case of verb attachment (i.e., Example (3)) is, of course, the correct
analysis.
Naturally the number of PP contexts with attachment ambiguity is theoretically
unbounded. One special case of note is a sequence of PPs such as Kim eats pizza
with chopsticks on Wednesdays at Papa Gino’s, where the number of discrete analyses for a
sequence of n PPs is defined by the corresponding Catalan number Cn (Church and Patil
1982). The bulk of PP attachment research, however, has focused exclusively on the case
of a single PP occurring immediately after an NP, which in turn is immediately preceded
by a verb. As such, we will focus our discussion predominantly on this syntactic context.
To simplify discussion, we will refer to the verb as v, the head noun of the immediately
proceeding NP as n1, the preposition as p, and the head noun of the NP object of
the preposition as n2. Returning to our earlier example, the corresponding 4-tuple is
(eatv, pizzan1, withp, chopsticksn2).
The high degree of interest in PP attachment stems from it being a common phe-
nomenon when parsing languages such as English, and hence a major cause of parser
errors (Lin 2003). As such, it has implications for any task requiring full syntactic
analysis or a notion of constituency, such as prosodic phrasing (van Herwijnen et al.
2003). Languages other than English with PP attachment ambiguity which have been
the target of research include Dutch (van Herwijnen et al. 2003), French (Gaussier and
Cancedda 2001; Gala and Lafourcade 2005), German (Hartrumpf 1999; Volk 2001, 2003;
Foth and Menzel 2006), Spanish (Calvo, Gelbukh, and Kilgarriff 2005), and Swedish
(Kokkinakis 2000; Aasa 2004; Volk 2006).
PP attachment research has undergone a number of significant paradigm shifts over
the course of the last three decades, and been the target of interest of theoretical syntax,
AI, psycholinguistics, statistical NLP, and statistical parsing.
Early research on PP attachment focused on the development of heuristics intended
to model human processing strategies, based on analysis of the competing parse trees
independent of lexical or discourse context (Frazier 1979; Sch¨utze 1995). For example,
Minimal Attachment was the strategy of choosing the attachment site which “mini-
mizes” the parse tree, as calculated by its node membership; assuming the parse trees
provided for Example (1), this would be unable to disambiguate between Examples (2)
and (3) as they both contain the same number of nodes. Late Attachment, on the other
hand, was the strategy of attaching “low” in the parse tree, corresponding to Exam-
ple (2). Ford, Bresnan, and Kaplan (1982) proposed an alternative heuristic strategy,
based on the existence of p in a subcategorization frame for v. In later research, Pereira
(1985) described a method for incorporating Right Association and Minimal Attachment

into a shift-reduce parser, and Whittemore and Ferrara (1990) developed a rule-based
algorithm to combine various attachment preferences on the basis of empirical evalua-
tion of the predictive power of each.
Syntactic preferences were of course a blunt instrument in dealing with PP attach-
ment, and largely ineffectual in predicting the difference in PP attachment between
Kim eats pizza with chopsticks (verb attachment) and Kim eats pizza with anchovies (noun
attachment), for example. This led to a shift away from syntactic methods in the 1980s
towards AI-inspired techniques which used world knowledge to resolve PP attachment
ambiguity. In the case of Example (1), for example, the knowledge that chopsticks are
an eating implement would suggest a preference for verb attachment, and similarly the
knowledge that they are not a foodstuff would suggest a dispreference for noun attach-
ment. Wilks, Huang, and Fass (1985) attempted to capture this type of world knowledge
using hand-coded “preferential semantics” of each of v, n1, p, and n2. Dahlgren and
McDowell (1986) simplified this analysis to use only p and n2, still in the form of
hand-coded rules. Hirst (1987) used his model of “commonsense semantics” to resolve
PP attachment ambiguity, based on verb-guided preferences (i.e., valence properties
of the verb) and plausibility relative to a knowledge base. In this same vein, Jensen
and Binot (1987) used the dictionary definitions of v and n2 as a “knowledge base” to
resolve PP attachment based on approximate reasoning, for example, by determining
that chopsticks is an instrument which is compatible with eat.
In parallel, in the area of psycholinguistics, Altmann and Steedman (1988) provided
experimental evidence to suggest that PP attachment resolution interacts dynamically
with discourse context, and that ambiguity is resolved on the basis of the interdepen-
dence between structure and the mental representation of that context. This suggested
that computational research on PP attachment resolution needed to take into account
the discourse context, in addition to syntax and world knowledge. Spivey-Knowlton
and Sedivy (1995) later used psycholinguistic experiments to demonstrate that verb-
specific attachment properties and NP definiteness both play important roles in the
human processing of PP attachment. Importantly, this work motivated the need for verb
classes to resolve PP attachment ambiguity.
The next significant shift in NLP research on PP attachment was brought about by
Hindle and Rooth (1993), who were the harbingers of statistical NLP and large-scale
empirical evaluation. Hindle and Rooth challenged the prevailing view at the time that
lexical semantics and/or discourse modeling were needed to resolve PP attachment, in
proposing a distributional approach, based simply on estimation of the probability of
p attaching high or low given v and n1 (ignoring n2). The method uses unambiguous
cases of PP attachment (e.g., cases of n1 being a pronoun [high attachment], or the PP
post-modifying n1 in subject position [low attachment]) to derive smoothed estimates
of Prhigh(p|v), Prhigh(NULL|n) (i.e., the probability of n not being post-modified by
a PP), and Prlow(p|n), which then form the basis of Prhigh(p|v, n) and Prlow(p|v, n),
respectively. The proposed method was significant in demonstrating the effectiveness of
simple co-occurrence probabilities, without explicit semantics or discourse processing,
and also in its ability to operate without explicitly annotated training data.
Resnik and Hearst (1993) observed that PP attachment preferences are also condi-
tioned on the semantics of the noun object of the preposition in the PP, as can be seen
in our earlier example of Kim eats pizza with chopsticks/anchovies where chopsticks leads
to verb attachment and anchovies to noun attachment. Although they were unable to
come up with a model which was empirically superior to existing methods which did
not represent the semantics of the noun object, this paved the way for a new wave of
research using the full 4-tuple of (v, n1, p, n2).

The first to successfully apply the full 4-tuple were Ratnaparkhi, Reynar, and
Roukos (1994), who in the process established a benchmark PP attachment data set
upon which most of the subsequent research has been based. The data set, colloquially
known as the “RRR” data set, was automatically extracted from the Wall Street Journal
section of the Penn Treebank, and is made up of 20,801 training and 3,097 test 4-tuples
of type (v, n1, p, n2), each of which is annotated with a binary label for verb or noun
attachment.3 Also of significance was the fact that Ratnaparkhi, Reynar, and Roukos
were able to come up with a “class” representation for words, based on distributional
similarity, that outperformed a simple word-based model.
The general framework established by Ratnaparkhi, Reynar, and Roukos (1994),
and the RRR data set, defined the task of PP attachment for over a decade. It has been
tackled using a variety of smoothing methods and machine learning algorithms, includ-
ing backed-off estimation (Collins and Brooks 1995), instance-based learning (Zavrel,
Daelemans, and Veenstra 1997; Zhao and Lin 2004), log-linear models (Franz 1996),
maximum entropy learning (Ratnaparkhi, Reynar, and Roukos 1994), decision trees
(Merlo, Crocker, and Berthouzoz 1997), neural networks (Sopena, Lloberas, and Moliner
1998; Alegre, Sopena, and Lloberas 1999), and boosting (Abney, Schapire, and Singer
1999). In addition to the four lexical and class-based features provided by the 4-tuple
(v, n1, p, n2), researchers have used noun definiteness, distributional similarity, noun
number, subcategorization categories, word proximity in corpus data, and PP semantic
class (Stetina and Nagao 1997; Yeh and Vilain 1998; Pantel and Lin 2000; Volk 2002). The
empirical benchmark for the data set was achieved by Stetina and Nagao (1997), who
used WordNet (Fellbaum 1998) to explicitly model verb and noun semantics.
In a novel approach to the task, Schwartz, Aikawa, and Quirk (2003) observed that
Japanese translations of English verb and noun attachment involve distinct construc-
tions. This allowed them to automatically identify instances of PP attachment ambiguity
in a parallel English–Japanese corpus, complete with attachment information. They
used this data to disambiguate PP attachment in English inputs, and demonstrated that,
the quality of English–Japanese machine translation improved significantly as a result.
More recently, Atterer and Sch¨utze (2007) challenged the real-world utility of meth-
ods based on the RRR data set, on the grounds that it is based on the availability of a
gold-standard parse tree for a given input. They proposed that, instead, PP attachment
be evaluated as a means of post-processing over the raw output of an actual parser,
and produced results to indicate: (a) that a state-of-the-art parser (Bikel 2004) does
remarkably well at PP attachment without a dedicated PP attachment module; but
also (b) that post-processing based on a range of methods developed over the RRR
data set (Collins and Brooks 1995; Toutanova, Manning, and Ng 2004; Olteanu and
Moldovan 2005) generally improves parser accuracy. In addition, they developed a
variant of the RRR data set (RRR-sent) which contains full sentential contexts of possible
PP attachment ambiguity. Others who have successfully built PP re-attachment models
for specific parsers are Olteanu (2004) and Foth and Menzel (2006). Agirre, Baldwin,
and Martinez (2008) used the evaluation methodology of Atterer and Sch¨utze (2007) to
confirm the finding from the original RRR data set that lexical semantics (in various
guises) can enhance PP attachment accuracy relative to a baseline parser. As part of this
effort, they developed a standardized data set for exploration of the interaction between
lexical semantics and parsing/PP attachment accuracy.

Baldwin, Kordoni, and Villavicencio A Survey of Prepositions in Applications
One significant variation on the classic binary PP attachment task which attempts
to generate a richer semantic characterisation of the PP is the work of Merlo (2003) and
Merlo and Esteve Ferrer (2006), who included classification of the PP as an argument
or adjunct, making for a four-way classification task. In this context, they found that
PP attachment resolution for argument PPs is considerably easier than is the case for
adjunct PPs.
Returning to our observation that PP attachment can occur in multiple syntactic
configurations, Merlo, Crocker, and Berthouzoz (1997) applied backed-off estimation
to the problem of multiple PP attachment, in the form of 14 discrete syntactic config-
urations. Unsurprisingly, they found the task considerably harder than the basic V NP
PP case, due to increased ambiguity and data sparseness. Mitchell (2004) similarly per-
formed an extensive analysis of the Penn Treebank to investigate the different contexts
PP attachment ambiguities occur in, and the relative ability of different PP attachment
methods to disambiguate each.
There have also been domain-specific methods proposed for PP attachment, for
example, in the area of biomedicine (Hahn, Romacker, and Schulz 2002; Pustejovsky
et al. 2002; Leroy, Chen, and Martinez 2003; Schuman and Bergler 2006).

2.2 The Syntax of Prepositional Multiword Expressions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998806277777778">
Prepositions are also often found as part of multiword expressions (MWEs), such as
verb-particle constructions (break down), prepositional verbs (rely on), determinerless
PPs (in hospital), complex prepositions (by means of) and compound nominals (affairs
of state). MWEs are lexical items which are composed of more than one word and are
lexically, syntactically, semantically, pragmatically, and/or statistically idiosyncratic in
some way (Sag et al. 2002). In this section, we present a brief overview of the syntax
of the key prepositional MWEs in English, and discuss a cross-section of some of the
recent research done in the area.
Prepositional MWEs span the full spectrum of morphosyntactic variation. Some
complex prepositions undergo no inflection, internal modification, or word order vari-
ation (e.g., in addition to) and are best analyzed as “words with spaces” (Sag et al.
2002). Others optionally allow internal modification (e.g., with [due/particular/special/...]
regard to) or determiner insertion (e.g., on [the] top of) and are considered to be semi-
fixed expressions (Villada Moir´on 2005). Compound nominals are similarly semi-fixed
expressions, in that they have rigid constraints on word order and lexical composition,
but allow morphological inflection (e.g., part(s) of speech).
The three prepositional MWE types that cause the greatest syntactic problems in
English, in terms of their relative frequency and tendency for syntactic variation, are:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.943955428571429">
1. verb-particle constructions (VPCs), where the verb selects for an
intransitive preposition (e.g., chicken out or hand in: Deh´e et al. [2002]);
2. prepositional verbs (PVs), where the verb selects for a transitive
preposition (e.g., rely on or refer to: Huddleston and Pullum [2002]);
3. determinerless PPs (PP–Ds), where a PP is made up of a preposition and
singular noun without a determiner (e.g., at school, off screen: Baldwin et al.
[2006]).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.8555265">
All three MWE types undergo limited syntactic variation (Sag et al. 2002). For exam-
ple, transitive verb particle constructions generally undergo the particle alternation,
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.992896">
125

<bodyText confidence="0.981857790697674">
whereby the particle may occur either adjacent to the verb (e.g., tear up the letter), or
be separated from the verb by the NP complement (e.g., tear the letter up). Some VPCs
readily occur with both orders (like tear up), while others have a strong preference for
a particular order (e.g., take off—under the interpretation of having the day off—tends
to occur in the particle-final configuration in usages such as take Friday off vs. ?take off
Friday).4 In addition, many VPCs undergo limited internal modification by adverbials,
where the adverb pre-modifies the particle (e.g., come straight over).
The syntactic variability of prepositional verbs is more subtle. PVs occur in two
basic forms: (1) fixed preposition PVs (e.g., come across), where the verb and selected
preposition must be strictly adjacent; and (2) mobile preposition PVs (e.g., refer to),
where the selected preposition is adjacent to the verb in the canonical word order, but
undergoes limited syntactic alternation. For example, mobile preposition PVs allow
limited coordination of PP objects (e.g., refer to the book and to the DVD), and the NP
object of the selected preposition can be passivized (e.g., the book they referred to).
Even subtler are the syntactic effects observed for determinerless PPs. The singular
noun in the PP–D is often strictly countable (e.g., off screen, on break), resulting in
syntactic markedness as, without a determiner, the noun does not constitute a saturated
NP. This in turn dictates the need for a dedicated analysis in a linguistically motivated
grammar in order to be able to avoid parse failures (Baldwin et al. 2004; van der Beek
2005). Additionally, there is considerable variation in the internal modifiability of deter-
minerless PPs, with some not permitting any internal modification (e.g., of course) and
others allowing optional internal modification (e.g., at considerable length). There are also,
however, cases of obligatory internal modification (e.g., at considerable/great expense vs.
*at expense) and highly restricted internal modification (e.g., at long last vs. *at great/short
last). Balancing up these different possibilities in terms of over- and undergeneration in
a grammar is far from trivial (Baldwin et al. 2006).
Naturally there are other prepositional MWE types in languages other than English
with their own syntactic complexities. Notable examples to have received attention in
the computational linguistics literature are Dutch “collocational prepositional phrases”
(Villada Moir´on 2005), German complex prepositions (Trawi´nski 2003; Trawinski, Sailer,
and Soehn 2006), German particle verbs (Schulte im Walde 2004; Rehbein and van
Genabith 2006), and Polish preposition–pronoun contractions (Trawi´nski 2005, 2006).
2.2.1 Prepositional MWEs in NLP. The syntactic variation of prepositional MWEs leads
to difficulties for NLP applications. To start with, there is the problem of identifying
their token occurrences, for example, for semantic indexing purposes. As with simplex
words, a given MWE may appear with different subcategorization frames (e.g., give up
vs. give up [something]), but added to that, the order of the elements may be flexible
or internally modified (see previous discussion), and some elements may be optional
(e.g., out in make a big thing (out) of [something]). Additionally, they conspire with PP
attachment ambiguity to compound structural ambiguity. For example, hand the paper in
today is ambiguous between a V NP PP analysis ([V hand] [NP the paper] [PP in today]), a
V NP analysis ([V hand] [NP the paper in today]), and a transitive VPC analysis ([V hand]
[NP the paper] [P in] [NP today]); of these, the final analysis is, of course, correct.

Baldwin, Kordoni, and Villavicencio A Survey of Prepositions in Applications
Related to this is the issue of resource development, especially lexicon development
for linguistically motivated parsers. First, a representation must be arrived at which is
sufficiently expressive to encode the syntactic subtleties of each MWE instance (Sag et al.
2002; Calzolari et al. 2002; Copestake et al. 2002; Odijk 2004). Second, the lexicon must be
populated in order to ensure adequate parser coverage over prepositional MWEs. Due
to the high productivity and domain specificity of prepositional MWEs, a number of
lexical acquisition approaches have been developed, usually customized to a particular
prepositional MWE type in a specific language.
For VPCs in English, for instance, Baldwin and Villavicencio (2002) focused on
their automatic extraction from raw text corpora, on the basis of a POS tagger, chunker,
and chunk grammar, and finally the combined output of the three along with various
linguistic and frequency features. Baldwin (2005a) expanded on this work to extract
VPCs complete with valence information, to produce a fully specified lexical item. In
both cases, it was found that 100% recall was extremely hard to achieve due to the
power-law distribution of VPC token frequencies in corpus data. That is, around half
of the VPC lexical items found in pre-existing lexical resources occurred in the BNC at
most 2 times.
Villavicencio (2005, 2006) took a different approach, in observing that VPCs occur
productively in semantically coherent clusters, based on (near-)synonymy of the head
verb (e.g., clear/clean/drain up and break/rip/cut/tear up). As a result, she expanded a
seed set of VPCs based on class-based verb semantic information, and used Web-based
statistics to filter false positives out of the resultant VPC candidate set.
Li et al. (2003) looked at the task of VPC identification rather than extraction,
namely, identifying each individual VPC token instance in corpus data, based on a
set of hand-crafted regular expressions. Although they report very high precision and
recall for their method, it has the obvious disadvantage that the regular expressions
must be manually encoded, and it is not clear that the proposed method is superior
to an off-the-shelf parser. Kim and Baldwin (2006, in press) attempted to automate
the process of identification by post-processing the output of the RASP parser, and
demonstrated (a) that the RASP parser (Briscoe, Carroll, and Watson 2006) is highly
effective at VPC identification, and (b) that the incorporation of lexicalized models of
selectional preferences can lead to modest improvements in parser accuracy.
In terms of English PV extraction, Baldwin (2005b) proposed a method based on a
combination of statistical measures and linguistic diagnostics, and demonstrated that
the combination of statistics with linguistic diagnostics achieved the best extraction
performance.
Research on prepositional MWEs in languages other than English includes Krenn
and Evert (2001) and Evert and Krenn (2005) on the extraction of German PP–verb
collocations (which are similar to verbal idioms/verb–noun combinations in English
[Fazly, Cook, and Stevenson 2009]) based on a range of lexical association measures.
Pecina (2008) further extended this work using a much broader set of lexical association
measures and classifier combination. Looking at German, D¨omges et al. (2007) analyzed
the productivity of PP–Ds headed by unter, and used their results to motivate a syntactic
analysis of the phenomenon. For Dutch, van der Beek (2005) worked on the extraction
of PP–Ds from the output of a parser, once again using a range of statistical measures.
Sharoff (2004) described a semi-automatic approach to classifying prepositional MWEs
in Russian, based on statistical measures and manual filtering using knowledge about
the structure of Russian prepositional phrases.
A recent development which we expect will further catalyze research on preposi-
tional (and general) MWE extraction was the release of a number of standardized data

3. Semantics
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999875962962963">
There are three diametrically opposed views to the semantics of prepositions: (1) prepo-
sitions are semantically vacuous and unworthy of semantic representation (a view
commonly subscribed to in the information retrieval community: Baeza-Yates and
Ribeiro-Neto [1999], Manning, Raghavan, and Sch¨utze [2008]); (2) preposition semantics
is a function of the words that select them and they in turn select, such that it is impos-
sible to devise a standalone semantic characterization of preposition semantics (Tseng
2000; Old 2003); and (3) prepositional semantics is complex but can be captured in a
standalone resource (Kipper, Dang, and Palmer 2000; Saint-Dizier and Vazquez 2001;
Litkowski and Hargraves 2005). Kipper, Snyder, and Palmer (2004, page 23) elegantly
summarized this third position as “it is precisely because the preposition–semantics
relationship is so complex that properly accounting for it will lead to a more robust
natural language resource.” Turning the clock back 16 years, Zelinski-Wibbelt (1993,
page 1) observed that “we are now witnessing a veritable plethora of investigations
into the semantics of preposition semantics” and speculated that “the time has come to
see how natural language processing (NLP) can benefit from the insights of theoretical
linguistics.” Although these prognostications were perhaps overly optimistic at the
time, they are now being progressively fulfilled.
In discussing preposition semantics, there is a basic distinction between composi-
tional (or regular/productive) and non-compositional (or irregular/collocational) se-
mantics. Preposition usages with compositional semantics transparently preserve the
standalone semantics of the preposition (e.g., They met on Friday), whereas those with
non-compositional semantics involve some level of semantic specialization or diver-
gence from the standalone semantics (e.g., They got on famously). In terms of formal
semantics, the complement vs. adjunct distinction5 is also relevant for determining the
logical form for a given input.
Subsequently, we review research on the formal and lexical semantics of preposi-
tions, and the semantics of prepositional MWEs.

3.1 Formal Semantic Approaches to Prepositions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99752125">
Research on the formal semantics of prepositions has focused predominantly on devis-
ing representations for temporal, spatial, and locative usages, the three most productive
and coherent classes of prepositions.
Prepositions can be used in order to convey temporal information relevant to the
duration of a proposition. Normally, three types of information are identified: (1) the
duration of the preposition, (2) its duration relative to the time of reference of the dis-
course, and (3) its absolute location on the time axis. Some prepositions convey all three
types of information, and others convey only one. Within each information type, the

5 In talking about the complement/adjunct distinction, we put aside the well-known issue of borderline
cases (Rauh 1993), and ignore language-specific phenomena such as Funktionsverbgef¨uge, where
German PPs can also occur as invariant syntagmas in light verb constructions (e.g., in Beschlag nehmen “to
occupy”) and the complement–adjunct distinction does not apply.

Baldwin, Kordoni, and Villavicencio A Survey of Prepositions in Applications
semantic input of temporal prepositions can vary considerably: They can distinguish
between existential and universal quantification over time, indicate whether or not the
extremes of the period are to be included, and mark the motion through time.
The main challenge for formal approaches to the semantics of temporal prepositions
is coming up with a representation which can adequately encode the different semantics
of temporal prepositions (Bennett 1975; Miller and Johnson-Laird 1976; R¨ohrer 1977;
Kamp 1981; Allen 1984; Richards et al. 1989; Br´ee and Smit 1986; Durrell and Br´ee 1993).
Another concern has been the ability to support compositional semantic interpretation
of temporal PPs, with emphasis on their quantificational role. For English, Pratt and
Francez (1997), for instance, proposed generalized temporal quantifiers to represent
temporal NPs, temporal PPs, and sentences.
With respect to spatial semantics, the focus of research has been on devising formal
semantic representations that capture both the functional relationships between the
objects, and human interaction with those objects. Along these lines, Kelleher and
Costello (2009) propose computational models of spatial preposition semantics for use
in visually situated dialogue systems.
Finally, with locative prepositions, formal semantic approaches have proposed that
they should decompose into three semantic elements: a locative relation, a reference
entity, and a place value. Each locative expression (e.g., a PP or NP) is generally assumed
to have a unique locative relation and place value. Thus, combinations of pure locative
relation markers and prepositions which are specified for place values are ruled out, and
no embedded locative relations are allowed in the semantic structure of a single locative
expression. Some locative prepositions are underspecified for a place value, however,
and thus are able to co-occur with a second preposition that specifies a place value
(e.g., out from under the table). The specific locative relation denoted by a preposition
is generally considered not to be specified in the lexicon, but instead to vary with
eventuality types.
Jørgensen and Lønning (2009) used the Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS)
framework (Copestake et al. 2005) as the basis for a language-independent represen-
tation of semantics of locative prepositions. They applied the proposed representa-
tion to English and Norwegian locative prepositions, and demonstrated its utility for
Norwegian–English machine translation. Hellan and Beermann (2005) similarly used
the MRS framework to capture the locative and spatial semantics of Norwegian prepo-
sitions. Ramsay (2005) proposed a unified theory of preposition semantics, where the
semantics of temporal usages of prepositions are predicted naturally from abstract
relational definitions. Arsenijevi´c (2005) developed a formal semantic analysis of prepo-
sitions in terms of event structure and applied it to a natural language generation
task.
Denis, Kuhn, and Wechsler (2003) analyzed the syntactico-semantics of V-PP goal
motion complexes in English (e.g., Kim ran to the library), and developed an analysis
based on the conclusion that the preposition is often semantically rather than syn-
tactically determined. This lends support to arguments for a systematic account of
preposition semantics.
Kordoni (2003b, 2003a, 2006) focused instead on the role of prepositions in diathesis
alternations, and proposed an MRS analysis of indirect prepositional arguments based
on English, German, and Modern Greek data. Specifically, she showed that a robust
formal semantic framework like MRS provides an appropriate theoretical basis for
a linguistically motivated account of indirect prepositional arguments, and also the
necessary formal generalizations for the analysis of such arguments in a multilingual
context (as a result of MRS structures being easily comparable across languages).

3.2 Lexical Semantic Resources for Prepositions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.956155333333333">
A number of lexical semantic resources have been developed specifically for prepo-
sitions, four of which are outlined here: (1) the English LCS Lexicon, (2) the Preposition
Project, (3) PrepNet, and (4) VerbNet.
The English LCS Lexicon (Dorr 1993, 1997) uses the formalism of Lexical Conceptual
Structure (based on work by Jackendoff [1983, 1990]6) to encode lexical knowledge
using a typed directed graph of semantic primitives and fields. In addition to a large
lexicon of verbs, it includes 165 English prepositions classified into 122 intransitive and
375 transitive senses. For example, the LCS representation for the directional sense of
up (as in up the stairs) is:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.662131">
(4) (toward Loc (nil 2) (UP Loc (nil 2) (∗ Thing 6)))
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.980735181818182">
where the numbers indicate the logical arguments of the predicates. This representation
indicates that the logical subject of the PP (indexed by “2”; e.g., the piano in move the
piano up the stairs) is relocated up in the direction of the logical argument (indexed by
“6”; e.g., the stairs in our example), which is in turn a concrete thing. The LCS Lexicon
was developed from a theoretical point of view and isn’t directly tied to corpus usage.
The Preposition Project (Litkowski 2002; Litkowski and Hargraves 2005, 2006) is
an attempt to develop a comprehensive semantic database for English prepositions,
intended for NLP applications. The project took the New Oxford Dictionary of English
(Pearsall 1998) as its source of preposition sense definitions, which it then fine-tuned
based on cross-comparison with both functionally tagged prepositions in FrameNet
(Baker, Fillmore, and Lowe 1998) and the account of preposition semantics in a de-
scriptive grammar of English (Quirk et al. 1985); it also draws partially on Dorr’s
LCS definitions of prepositions. Importantly, the Preposition Project is building up a
significant number of tagged preposition instances through analysis of the preposition
data in FrameNet, which it then uses to characterize the noun selectional preferences of
each preposition sense and also the attachment properties to verbs of different types. At
the time of writing, 673 preposition senses for 334 prepositions (mostly phrasal prepo-
sitions) have been annotated. In tandem with developing type-level sense definitions of
prepositions, the Preposition Project has sense annotated over 27,000 occurrences of the
56 most common prepositions, based on functionally tagged prepositions in FrameNet.
To date, the primary application of the Preposition Project has been in a SemEval 2007
task on the word sense disambiguation of prepositions (see Section 3.3).
PrepNet (Saint-Dizier and Vazquez 2001; Cannesson and Saint-Dizier 2002; Saint-
Dizier 2005, 2008) is an attempt to develop a compositional account of preposition
semantics which interfaces with the semantics of the predicate (e.g., verb or predicative
noun). Similarly to the English LCS Lexicon, it uses LCS as the descriptive language,
in conjunction with typed λ-calculus and underspecified representations. Noteworthy
elements of PrepNet are that it attempts to capture selectional constraints, metaphor-
ical sense extension, and complex arguments. PrepNet was originally developed over
French prepositions, but has since been applied to the analysis of instrumentals across
a range of languages (Saint-Dizier 2006b).
VerbNet (Kipper, Dang, and Palmer 2000; Kipper Schuler 2005) contains a shallow
hierarchy of 50 spatial prepositions, classified into five categories. The hierarchy is

Baldwin, Kordoni, and Villavicencio A Survey of Prepositions in Applications
derived from pioneering work by Sp¨arck Jones and Boguraev (1987), which is in turn
derived from Wood (1979). The preposition sense inventory was used as the basis for
extending VerbNet and led to significant redevelopment of the verb class set (Kipper,
Snyder, and Palmer 2004), in a poignant illustration of how preposition semantics
impinges on verb semantics.
In other work, Sablayrolles (1995) classified 199 simple and complex spatial prepo-
sitions into 16 classes. Lersundi and Agirre (2003) applied a similar methodology to
Dorr and Habash (2002) in developing a multilingual sense inventory for Basque post-
positions and English and Spanish prepositions. Fort and Guillaume (2007) developed
a syntactico-semantic lexicon of French prepositions, partly based on PrepNet; their
particular interest was in enhancing parsing performance. Old (2003) analyzed Roget’s
Thesaurus and arrived at the conclusion that it was not a good source of standalone
preposition semantics. Beavers (2003) analyzed the aspectual and path properties of
goal-marking postpositions in Japanese, and proposed an analysis based on predicate
and event restrictions. Boonthum, Toida, and Levinstein (2005, 2006) defined a general-
purpose sense inventory of seven prepositions (but purportedly applicable to all prepo-
sitions), taking the LCS lexicon as a starting point and expanding the sense inventory
by consulting Quirk et al. (1985) and Barker (1996). Finally, as part of a more general
attempt to capture lexical semantics in the formalism of Multilayered Extended Seman-
tic Networks (MultiNet), Helbig (2006) developed a semantic treatment of prepositions,
focusing primarily on German.
There has historically been a strong interest in preposition semantics in the field of
cognitive linguistics (Talmy 1988), in the form of “schemas.” Schemas are an attempt to
visualize the relation between the object of the preposition (the Trajector, or TR) and its
cognitive context (the Landmark, or LM). They provide a language-independent repre-
sentation, and have been used to analyze crosslinguistic correspondences in preposition
semantics. For example, Tyler and Evans (2003)used schemas to capture the semantics of
English prepositions, arguing that all meanings are grounded in human spatio-physical
experience. Schemas have also been used as the basis of crosslinguistic analysis of
preposition semantics, for example, by Brala (2000) to describe the senses of on and in
in English and Croatian, Kna´s (2006) to motivate a sense inventory for at in English and
Polish, and Cosme and Gilquin (2008) to contrast with and avec in English and French.
Trujillo (1995) also developed a language-independent classification of spatial
prepositions for machine translation purposes, in a lexicalist framework.

3.3 Automatic Classification of Preposition Sense
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999829384615385">
Only a modest amount of research has been carried out on the sense disambiguation
of prepositions, largely because until recently, there haven’t been lexical semantic re-
sources and sense-tagged corpora for prepositions that could be used for this purpose.
Classification of preposition sense has been motivated as a standalone task in appli-
cations such as machine translation, and also as a means of improving the general
performance of semantic tasks such as semantic role labeling.
O’Hara and Wiebe (2003) were the first to perform a standalone preposition word
sense disambiguation (WSD) task, based on the semantic roles in the Penn Treebank.
They collapsed the semantic roles into seven basic semantic classes, and built a decision
tree classifier based on a set of contextual features similar to those used in WSD systems.
O’Hara and Wiebe (2009) is an updated version of this original research, using a broader
range of resources. Ye and Baldwin (2006) also built on the earlier research, in attempt-
ing to enhance the accuracy of semantic role labeling with dedicated PP disambiguation.

They demonstrated the potential for accurate preposition labeling to contribute to large-
scale improvements in overall semantic role labeling performance.
As mentioned in Section 3.2, Litkowski and Hargraves (2007) ran a task on the
WSD of prepositions at SemEval 2007, as a spinoff of the Preposition Project. The task
focused on 34 prepositions, with a combined total of 332 senses. Similarly to a lexical
sample WSD task, participants were required to disambiguate token instances of each
preposition relative to the provided discrete sense inventory. Three teams participated
in the task (Popescu, Tonelli, and Pianta 2007; Ye and Baldwin 2007; Yuret 2007), with all
systems outperforming two baselines over both fine- and coarse-grained sense invento-
ries, through various combinations of lexical, syntactic, and semantic features. The best-
performing system achieved F-scores of 0.818 and 0.861 over fine- and coarse-grained
senses, respectively (Ye and Baldwin 2007).
In other papers dedicated to prepositional WSD, Boonthum, Toida, and Levinstein
(2005, 2006) proposed a semantic collocation-based approach to preposition interpre-
tation, and demonstrated the import of the method in a paraphrase recognition task.
Alam (2003, 2004) used decision trees to disambiguate 12 senses of over, distinguishing
between senses which are determined by their governor and those which are deter-
mined by their NP complement.
Baldwin (2006) explored the interaction between preposition valence and the dis-
tributional hypothesis, based on latent semantic analysis (LSA; Deerwester et al. 1990).
He derived gold-standard preposition-to-preposition similarities using each of Dorr’s
LCS lexicon (based on the method of Resnik and Diab [2000]) and Roget’s Thesaurus,
and compared them to the similarities predicted by LSA, in each case using either
valence specification (considering intransitive and transitive prepositions separately) or
valence underspecification (considering both preposition valences together). His results
indicated higher correlation when valence specification is used, suggesting not only
that there is a significant difference in semantics between transitive and intransitive
usages of a given preposition, but that it is sufficiently marked in the context of use that
distributional methods are able to pick up on it.
Cook and Stevenson (2006) developed a four-way classification of the semantics
of up in VPCs based on cognitive grammar, and classified token instances based on a
combination of linguistic and word co-occurrence features.
In a machine translation context, Trujillo (1995) used selectional preferences and
unification to perform target language disambiguation over his classification of spatial
prepositions.
Srihari, Niu, and Li (2000) used manual rules to disambiguate prepositions in
named entities.

3.4 The Semantics of Prepositional MWEs

<bodyText confidence="0.999588333333333">
Prepositional MWEs—focusing primarily on the English MWE types of VPCs, PVs, PP–
Ds, and compound nominals—populate the spectrum from fully compositional to fully
non-compositional (Dixon 1982; McCarthy, Keller, and Carroll 2003). For instance, put
up (as in put the picture up) is fully compositional, whereas make out (as in Kim and Sandy
made out) is fully non-compositional. Compositionality can be viewed relative to each
component word (Bannard 2005) or holistically for the MWE as a single unit (McCarthy,
Keller, and Carroll 2003). With play out (as in see how the match plays out), for example,
we might claim that play is non-compositional but out is (semi-)compositional, and that
as a whole the VPC is non-compositional. The question of compositionality is confused

somewhat by productive constructions such as the resultative up (e.g., eat/beat/finish/...
up) and the manner by (e.g., by train/car/broomstick/...), which have specialized semantics
relative to their simplex usages but occur relatively freely with this semantics within a
given construction (VPC and PP–D, respectively, in our examples).
There have been a number of attempts to model the compositionality of VPCs. Ban-
nard (2005, 2006) considered VPC compositionality at the component word level, and
proposed a distributional approach that assumes there is a positive correlation between
compositionality and the distributional similarity of each component to simplex usages
of that same word. McCarthy, Keller, and Carroll (2003) opted for a holistic notion
of compositionality and used a range of approaches based on the distributional “the-
saurus” of Lin (1998) to model compositionality, for example, in calculating the overlap
in the top-N similar words for a given VPC and its head verb. They also examined
the use of statistical tests such as mutual information in modeling compositionality,
and found the similarity-based methods to correlate more highly with the human
judgments. Baldwin et al. (2003) used LSA to analyze the compositionality of VPCs
(and compound nouns), and once again demonstrated that there is a positive correlation
between compositionality and the distributional similarity between a given VPC and
its head word. Kim and Baldwin (2007) predicted the compositionality of VPCs based
on a combination of the McCarthy, Keller, and Carroll (2003) and Bannard (2006) data
sets, and analysis of verb–particle co-occurrence patterns. Taking a different approach to
the task, Patrick and Fletcher (2005) classified token instances of verb–preposition pairs
according to the three classes of decomposable (syntactic dependence between the P and
V, with compositional semantics), non-decomposable (syntactic dependence between
the P and V, with idiomatic semantics), and independent (no syntactic dependence
between the P and V).
Levi (1978) pioneered the use of prepositions as a means of interpreting compound
nouns, through the notion of compatibility with paraphrases incorporating preposi-
tions. For example, baby chair can be paraphrased as chair for (a) baby, indicating com-
patibility with the FOR class. In her original research, Levi used four prepositions, in
combination with a set of verbs (for relative clause paraphrases) and semantic roles
(for nominalizations). Lauer (1995) extended this research in developing an exclusively
preposition-based set of seven semantic classes. For example, Levi would interpret truck
driver as PATIENT, in the sense that truck is the patient of the underlying verb of the
head noun to drive, whereas Lauer would interpret it as OF (c.f., driver of (the) truck).
Girju (2007, 2009) leveraged translation data to improve the accuracy of compound
noun interpretation, based on the observation that the choice of preposition in Ro-
mance languages is often indicative of the semantics of the compound noun. Con-
versely, Johnston and Busa (1996) used Qualia structure from the Generative Lexicon
(Pustejovsky 1995) to interpret the prepositions in Italian complex nominals, such as
macchina da corsa ”race car”. Jensen and Nilsson (2003) used (Danish) prepositions as
the basis of a finite set of role relations with which to describe the meaning content
of nominals, and demonstrated the utility of the resultant ontology in disambiguating
nominal phrases.

the inclusion of prepositions. Similarly, applications which incorporate an element of
natural language generation or realization need to preserve prepositions in the interests
of producing well-formed outputs.
Riloff (1995) challenged the validity of the stop-word philosophy for text classi-
fication, and demonstrated that dependency tuples incorporating prepositions are a
more effective document representation than simple words. In a direct challenge to
the prevalent “stop word” perception of prepositions in information retrieval, Hansen
(2005) and Lassen (2006) placed emphasis on not only prepositions but preposi-
tion semantics in a music retrieval system and ontology-based text search system,
respectively.
Information extraction is one application where prepositions are uncontrover-
sially crucial to system accuracy, in terms of the role they play in named entities
(Cucchiarelli and Velardi 2001; Toral 2005; Kozareva 2006) and in IE patterns, in linking
the elements in a text (Appelt et al. 1993; Muslea 1999; Ono et al. 2001; Leroy and Chen
2002).
Benamara (2005) used preposition semantics in a cooperative question answering
system. In the context of cross-language question answering (CLQA), Hartrumpf,
Helbig, and Osswald (2006) used MultiNet to interpret the semantics of German
prepositions, and demonstrated that in instances where the answer passage contained
a different preposition to that included in the original question, preposition semantics
boosted the performance of their CLQA system.
Boonthum, Toida, and Levinstein (2006) successfully applied their preposition WSD
method in a paraphrase recognition task, namely, predicting that Kim covered the baby in
blankets and Kim covered the baby with blankets have essentially the same semantics. They
proposed seven general senses of prepositions (e.g., PARTICIPANT, INSTRUMENT, and
QUALITY), and annotated prepositions occurring in 120 sentences for each of 10 prepo-
sitions. They evaluated a WSD method over this data, and sketched how the preposition
sense information could then be used for paraphrase recognition.
Prepositions have deservedly received a moderate amount of attention in appli-
cations which require explicit representation of 3D space, such as robotics, animated
agents, and virtual reality, in the context of interpreting the spatial information of
prepositions. For example, Xu and Badler (2000) developed a geometric definition of
the motion trajectories of prepositions, whereas Tokunaga, Koyama, and Saito (2005)
use potential functions to estimate the spatial extent of Japanese spatial nouns (which
combine with postpositions to have a similar syntactic and semantic profile to Eng-
lish spatial prepositions). Kelleher and van Genabith (2003) proposed a method for
interpreting in front of and behind in a virtual reality environment based on different
frames of reference. Hying (2007) carried out an analysis of preposition semantics
in the HRCR Map Task corpus, and used it to evaluate two models of projective
prepositions. Kelleher and Kruijff (2005) developed a model for grounding spatial
expressions in visual perception and also for modeling proximity, and Reichelt and
Verleih (2005) developed the B3D system for generating a computational representation
of prepositions in geospatial applications. Furlan, Baldwin, and Klippel (2007) used
preposition occurrence in Web data as a means of classifying landmarks for use in
route directions. Finally, Kelleher and Costello (2009) proposed computational models
of topological and projective spatial prepositions for use in a visually situated dialogue
system.
In the field of machine translation (MT), spatial and temporal prepositions have
received a moderate amount of attention, particularly in the context of interlingua-
and transfer-based MT. Dorr and Voss (1993) mapped prepositions onto 5-place spatial

predicates in the context of interlingua-based MT, building on the work of Talmy (1985)
and Jackendoff (1983, 1990). N¨ubel (1996) developed a set of interlingual predicates for
adjunct PPs in EnglishHGerman MT, incorporating a dialogue component which can
be used to disambiguate prepositions relative to the discourse context. Bond, Ogura,
and Uchino (1997) developed a dedicated type hierarchy for the generation of preposi-
tions associated with temporal expressions in Japanese--+English machine translation.
Kumar Naskar and Bandyopadhyay (2006) proposed a transfer-based method for trans-
lating English prepositions into Bengali postpositions/inflectional markers, focusing
on spatial, temporal, and also idiomatic usages. Bond (1998) proposed an algorithm
for translating Japanese spatial nouns into English prepositions based on semantic
fields. Trujillo (1995) used his classification of spatial prepositions as the basis of an
EnglishHSpanish translation system using bilingual lexical rules. Hajiˇc et al. (2002)
proposed a method for inserting prepositions into tectogrammatical representations in
Czech--+English MT, although they did not manage to integrate the predictions into
their final MT system. Husain, Sharma, and Reddy (2007) achieved promising results
using an explicit model of preposition semantics as the basis for preposition selection in
Hindi/Telugu--+English machine translation.
In the context of statistical machine translation, Toutanova and Suzuki (2007) iden-
tified that case marker (= postposition) generation poses a significant challenge for stan-
dard phrase-based methods in English--+Japanese translation, identifying case marker
errors in 16% of outputs. They proposed an n-best reranking method to improve case
marker generation performance, whereby they expand the n-best list to include extra
case marker variations, and perform case marker prediction for each bunsetsu.7 In eval-
uation, they demonstrated that their proposed method significantly outperforms both
the baseline SMT system (Quirk, Menezes, and Cherry 2005) and a comparable n-best
reranking method without dedicated case marker candidate expansion. The significance
of this research is that it demonstrates that dedicated handling of postpositions can
enhance SMT performance, a result which has promise for adpositions and markers in
other languages.
As stated in Section 1, prepositions are notoriously hard for non-native speakers to
master, and are a frequent source of errors in English as a Second Language (ESL) prose.
Errors can take the form of incorrect preposition selection (e.g., *Kim stayed in home),
erroneous preposition insertion (e.g., *Kim played at outside), or erroneous preposition
omission (e.g., *Kim went φ the conference) (Tetreault and Chodorow 2008b). Tetreault
and Chodorow (2008b) proposed a combined detection/correction method based on a
supervised model. For each preposition in a text, they predict the most likely candidate
from 34 candidates, based on local word context. If the most likely candidate differs
from the original preposition selection, an error is predicted and correction proposed.
In evaluation over ESL texts, they found that their method performs at high precision
but low recall. Separately, they found that the same method performs considerably
better when applied to preposition selection over native English text, and also that it
is important to have multiple annotators correct ESL text in order to avoid skewing the
data (Tetreault and Chodorow 2008a). In other research, Gamon et al. (2008) performed
preposition selection in terms of both selection and insertion, but over a smaller
set of prepositions. De Felice and Pulman (2007) similarly proposed a method for

5. Introduction to the Articles in This Special Issue
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.999766090909091">
For this special issue we invited submissions that brought a theoretical basis to research
on prepositions in lexical resources and NLP tasks. The number of submissions re-
ceived reflects the interest in prepositions at this time, with a total of 16 submissions.
On the basis of a rigorous review process, we selected four articles for inclusion in
the special issue, covering: the use of semantic resources to disambiguate preposition
semantics, for use in lexical acquisition (O’Hara and Wiebe 2009); a crosslingual lexical
semantic analysis of prepositions to interpret nominal compounds (Girju 2009); a formal
semantic analysis of preposition semantics, and its possible application in Norwegian–
English machine translation (Jørgensen and Lønning 2009); and a computational model
for preposition semantics for use in a dialogue system (Kelleher and Costello 2009). We
now outline each of these articles.
The first two articles look at the semantic interpretation of prepositions, as they tend
to be highly polysemous and have a number of closely related senses.
O’Hara and Wiebe look at the disambiguation of preposition semantics for use
in lexical acquisition, in semi-automatically extending lexical resources. They investi-
gate the utility of information learned from resources such as the Penn Treebank and
FrameNet, to perform semantic role disambiguation of PPs. The proposed methodology
is evaluated in a series of experiments, and different sense granularities are contrasted
in task-based evaluation.
Prepositions are highly frequent in many languages, but also highly idiomatic in
usage in a given language (hence the difficulty of non-native speakers in learning to use
prepositions correctly). However, there are instances of cross-linguistic regularities in
their linguistic realizations. For example, when translating English nominal compounds
of the type Noun Preposition Noun (N P N) and Noun Noun (N N) into Romance
languages, these are often translated into N P N compounds, where the choice of prepo-
sition is (semi-)predictable from the semantics of the compound. Girju investigates
the role of the syntactic and semantic properties of prepositions in English and Romance
languages in the automatic semantic interpretation of English nominal compounds.
On the basis of an extensive corpus analysis of the distribution of semantic relations
in nominal compounds in English and five Romance languages, she attempts to dis-
ambiguate the semantic relations in English nominal compounds. She focuses on non-
equative compositional nominal compounds, and empirically tests the contribution of
prepositions to the task of semantic interpretation, using a supervised, knowledge-
intensive model.
Identification of crosslinguistic and possibly universal properties of prepositions (or
equivalent constructions) could potentially impact on a number of NLP applications. In
machine translation, for example, a formal description of the crosslinguistic semantic
properties of prepositions could provide the basis for an interlingua. This is the topic of
the third article in this special issue: Jørgensen and Lønning propose a unification-based
grammar implementation of a formal semantic analysis of preposition semantics, and
demonstrate its application in Norwegian→English MT.
A correct handling of prepositions, particularly spatial prepositions, is also impor-
tant in dialogue systems, as prepositions are often used to refer to entities in the physical
environment of system interaction. The last article in this special issue addresses this

topic: Kelleher and Costello present computational models of spatial preposition
semantics for use in visually situated dialogue systems. The proposed models of
topological and projective spatial prepositions can be used for both interpretation and
generation of prepositional expressions in complex visual environments containing
multiple objects, and are able to account for the contextual effect which other distractor
objects can have on the region described by a preposition. The evaluation is done in
terms of psycholinguistic tests evaluating the approach to distractor interference on
prepositional semantics. The models are employed in a human–robot dialogue system
to interpret locative expressions containing a topological preposition and to generate
spatial references in visually situated contexts.

6. Discussion and Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999973837837838">
As we hope to have demonstrated in this introduction, prepositions have led a mixed
existence in computational linguistics and related fields, particularly in the context
of applications. In applications requiring spatial interpretation (e.g., situated dialogue
systems), they have been the focus of dedicated research, and in applications which
incorporate a language generation component such as MT, there have been isolated
instances exemplifying the need for dedicated handling of prepositions/case markers.
In general, however, they tend to have been relegated to the sidelines in applied NLP
research.
Research on prepositions has tended to concentrate on a specific subset of preposi-
tions in a particular language, often as a one-off research task which has failed to make
broader impact in the field of computational linguistics. PP attachment—especially in
English—has been an exception, in the sense that the RRR data set has given rise to an
active strand of research centered around prepositions. We hope that variants of the RRR
data set from Atterer and Sch¨utze (2007) and Agirre, Baldwin, and Martinez (2008) will
reinvigorate interest in PP attachment, in a situated parsing context. Similarly, the emer-
gence of resources such as the Preposition Project, and the data set made available for
the SemEval 2007 task on the word sense disambiguation of prepositions (Litkowski
and Hargraves 2007), provide the means for more detailed analysis of preposition
semantics. In addition to standalone word sense disambiguation tasks, however, there
needs to be more research on the interaction of preposition semantics with other
semantic tasks, such as semantic role labeling and the word sense disambiguation of
content words. The increasing availability of large-scale parallel corpora paves the way
for crosslinguistic research on preposition syntax. Areas of particular promise in this
regard are methods for generating prepositions in MT, and automatic error correction of
preposition usage in non-native speaker text. Following the lead of Saint-Dizier (2006b),
Jørgensen and Lønning (2009), and others, we also hope to see more crosslinguistic
and typological research on the lexical semantics of prepositions. Although there has
been a steady proliferation of WordNets for different languages, linked variously to
English WordNet (e.g., EuroWordNet for several European languages [Vossen 1998],
BALKANET for Balkan languages [Stamou et al. 2002], HowNet for Chinese [Dong and
Dong 2006], and Japanese WordNet for Japanese [Isahara et al. 2008]), they have tended
to follow the lead of English WordNet and focus exclusively on content words. Given
the increasing maturity of resources such as the Preposition Project and PrepNet, the
time seems right to develop preposition sense inventories for more languages, linked
back to English. On the basis of currently available resources and future efforts such
as these, we believe there will be a steady lowering of the barrier to including a more
systematic handling of prepositions in NLP applications.

The purpose of this article has been to highlight the theoretical and applied re-
search that has been done on prepositions in computational linguistics, focusing on
computational syntax and semantics. In particular, we have aimed to highlight applied
research which has focused specifically on prepositions. It is our hope that through this
special issue, we will rekindle interest in prepositions and motivate greater awareness
of prepositions in various applications.

The main challenge for formal approaches to the semantics of temporal prepositions is coming up with a representation which can adequately encode the different semantics of temporal prepositions (Bennett 1975; Miller and Johnson-Laird 1976; R¨ohrer 1977; Kamp 1981; Allen 1984; Richards et al. 1989; Br´ee and Smit 1986; Durrell and Br´ee 1993). Another concern has been the ability to support compositional semantic interpretation of temporal PPs, with emphasis on their quantificational role. For English, Pratt and Francez (1997), for instance, proposed generalized temporal quantifiers to represent temporal NPs, temporal PPs, and sentences. With respect to spatial semantics, the focus of research has been on devising formal semantic representations that capture both the functional relationships between the objects, and human interaction with those objects.

Hirst (1987) used his model of “commonsense semantics” to resolve PP attachment ambiguity, based on verb-guided preferences (i.e., valence properties of the verb) and plausibility relative to a knowledge base. In this same vein, Jensen and Binot (1987) used the dictionary definitions of v and n2 as a “knowledge base” to resolve PP attachment based on approximate reasoning, for example, by determining that chopsticks is an instrument which is compatible with eat. In parallel, in the area of psycholinguistics, Altmann and Steedman (1988) provided experimental evidence to suggest that PP attachment resolution interacts dynamically with discourse context, and that ambiguity is resolved on the basis of the interdependence between structure and the mental representation of that context. This suggested that computational research on PP attachment resolution needed to take into account the discourse context, in addition to syntax and world knowledge. Spivey-Knowlton and Sedivy (1995) later used psycholinguistic experiments to demonstrate that verbspecific attachment properties and NP definiteness both play important roles in the hu</context>

In a direct challenge to the prevalent “stop word” perception of prepositions in information retrieval, Hansen (2005) and Lassen (2006) placed emphasis on not only prepositions but preposition semantics in a music retrieval system and ontology-based text search system, respectively. Information extraction is one application where prepositions are uncontroversially crucial to system accuracy, in terms of the role they play in named entities (Cucchiarelli and Velardi 2001; Toral 2005; Kozareva 2006) and in IE patterns, in linking the elements in a text (Appelt et al. 1993; Muslea 1999; Ono et al. 2001; Leroy and Chen 2002). Benamara (2005) used preposition semantics in a cooperative question answering system. In the context of cross-language question answering (CLQA), Hartrumpf, Helbig, and Osswald (2006) used MultiNet to interpret the semantics of German prepositions, and demonstrated that in instances where the answer passage contained a different preposition to that included in the original question, preposition semantics boosted the performance of their CLQA system.

<context position="1664" citStr="Burnard 2000" startWordPosition="247" endWordPosition="248">For example, in machine translation, generating a preposition (or “case marker” in languages such as Japanese) incorrectly in the target language can lead to critical semantic divergences over the source language string. Equivalently in information retrieval and information extraction, it would seem desirable to be able to predict that book on NLP and book about NLP mean largely the same thing, but paranoid about drugs and paranoid on drugs suggest very different things. Prepositions are often among the most frequent words in a language. For example, based on the British National Corpus (BNC; Burnard 2000), four out of the top-ten most-frequent words in English are prepositions (of, to, in, and for). In terms of both parsing and generation, therefore, accurate models of preposition usage are essential to avoid repeatedly making errors. Despite their frequency, however, they are notoriously difficult to master, even for humans (Chodorow, Tetreault, and Han 2007). For example, Lindstromberg (2001) estimates that less than 10% of upper-level English as a Second 1 Our discussion will focus primarily on prepositions in English, but many of the comments we make apply equally to adpositions (prepositi</context>

The specific locative relation denoted by a preposition is generally considered not to be specified in the lexicon, but instead to vary with eventuality types.

First, a representation must be arrived at which is sufficiently expressive to encode the syntactic subtleties of each MWE instance (Sag et al. 2002; Calzolari et al. 2002; Copestake et al. 2002; Odijk 2004). Second, the lexicon must be populated in order to ensure adequate parser coverage over prepositional MWEs. Due to the high productivity and domain specificity of prepositional MWEs, a number of lexical acquisition approaches have been developed, usually customized to a particular prepositional MWE type in a specific language.

Boonthum, Toida, and Levinstein (2005, 2006) defined a generalpurpose sense inventory of seven prepositions (but purportedly applicable to all prepositions), taking the LCS lexicon as a starting point and expanding the sense inventory by consulting Quirk et al. (1985) and Barker (1996). Finally, as part of a more general attempt to capture lexical semantics in the formalism of Multilayered Extended Semantic Networks (MultiNet), Helbig (2006) developed a semantic treatment of prepositions, focusing primarily on German. There has historically been a strong interest in preposition semantics in the field of cognitive linguistics (Talmy 1988), in the form of “schemas.” Schemas are an attempt to visualize the relation between the object of the preposition (the Trajector, or TR) and its cognitive context (the Landmark, or LM). They provide a language-independent representation, and have been used to analyze crosslinguistic correspondences in preposition semantics.

This suggested that computational research on PP attachment resolution needed to take into account the discourse context, in addition to syntax and world knowledge. Spivey-Knowlton and Sedivy (1995) later used psycholinguistic experiments to demonstrate that verbspecific attachment properties and NP definiteness both play important roles in the human processing of PP attachment. Importantly, this work motivated the need for verb classes to resolve PP attachment ambiguity. The next significant shift in NLP research on PP attachment was brought about by Hindle and Rooth (1993), who were the harbingers of statistical NLP and large-scale empirical evaluation. Hindle and Rooth challenged the prevailing view at the time that lexical semantics and/or discourse modeling were needed to resolve PP attachment, in proposing a distributional approach, based simply on estimation of the probability of p attaching high or low given v and n1 (ignoring n2). The method uses unambiguous cases of PP attachment (e.g., cases of n1 being a pronoun [high attachment], or the PP post-modifying n1 in subject position [low attachment]) to derive smoothed estimates of Prhigh(p|v), Prhigh(NULL</context>

In the case of Example (1), for example, the knowledge that chopsticks are an eating implement would suggest a preference for verb attachment, and similarly the knowledge that they are not a foodstuff would suggest a dispreference for noun attachment. Wilks, Huang, and Fass (1985) attempted to capture this type of world knowledge using hand-coded “preferential semantics” of each of v, n1, p, and n2. Dahlgren and McDowell (1986) simplified this analysis to use only p and n2, still in the form of hand-coded rules. Hirst (1987) used his model of “commonsense semantics” to resolve PP attachment ambiguity, based on verb-guided preferences (i.e., valence properties of the verb) and plausibility relative to a knowledge base. In this same vein, Jensen and Binot (1987) used the dictionary definitions of v and n2 as a “knowledge base” to resolve PP attachment based on approximate reasoning, for example, by determining that chopsticks is an instrument which is compatible with eat.

Finally, we outline the contributions of the papers included in this special issue (Section 5) and conclude with a discussion of research areas relevant to prepositions which we believe are ripe for further exploration (Section 6). 2. Syntax There has been a tendency for prepositions to be largely ignored in the area of syntactic research as “an annoying little surface peculiarity” (Jackendoff 1973, page 345). In computational terms, the two most important syntactic considerations with prepositions are: (1) selection (Fillmore 1968; Bennett 1975; Tseng 2000; Kracht 2003), and (2) valence (Huddleston and Pullum 2002). Selection is the property of a preposition being subcategorized/specified by the governor (usually a verb) as part of its argument structure. An example of a selected preposition is with in dispense with introductions, where introductions is the object of the verb dispense, but must be realized in a prepositional phrase headed by with (c.f. *dispense introductions). Conventionally, selected prepositions are specified uniquely (e.g., dispense with) or as well-defined clusters (e.g., chuckle over/at), and have bleached semantics. Selected prepositions contrast with unselected prepositions, whi</context>

Following the lead of Saint-Dizier (2006b), Jørgensen and Lønning (2009), and others, we also hope to see more crosslinguistic and typological research on the lexical semantics of prepositions. Although there has been a steady proliferation of WordNets for different languages, linked variously to English WordNet (e.g., EuroWordNet for several European languages [Vossen 1998], BALKANET for Balkan languages [Stamou et al. 2002], HowNet for Chinese [Dong and Dong 2006], and Japanese WordNet for Japanese [Isahara et al. 2008]), they have tended to follow the lead of English WordNet and focus exclusively on content words. Given the increasing maturity of resources such as the Preposition Project and PrepNet, the time seems right to develop preposition sense inventories for more languages, linked back to English. On the basis of currently available resources and future efforts such as these, we believe there will be a steady lowering of the barrier to including a more systematic handling of prepositions in NLP applications. 137 Computational Linguistics Volume 35, Number 2 The purpose of this article has been to hi</context>

Li et al. (2003) looked at the task of VPC identification rather than extraction, namely, identifying each individual VPC token instance in corpus data, based on a set of hand-crafted regular expressions. Although they report very high precision and recall for their method, it has the obvious disadvantage that the regular expressions must be manually encoded, and it is not clear that the proposed method is superior to an off-the-shelf parser. Kim and Baldwin (2006, in press) attempted to automate the process of identification by post-processing the output of the RASP parser, and demonstrated (a) that the RASP parser (Briscoe, Carroll, and Watson 2006) is highly effective at VPC identification, and (b) that the incorporation of lexicalized models of selectional preferences can lead to modest improvements in parser accuracy. In terms of English PV extraction, Baldwin (2005b) proposed a method based on a combination of statistical measures and linguistic diagnostics, and demonstrated that the combination of statistics with linguistic diagnostics achieved </context>

They also examined the use of statistical tests such as mutual information in modeling compositionality, and found the similarity-based methods to correlate more highly with the human judgments. Baldwin et al.

Two large areas of research on the syntactic aspects of prepositions are (a) PPattachment and (b) prepositions in multiword expressions, which are discussed in the following sections. Although this article will focus largely on the syntax of prepositions in English, prepositions in other languages naturally have their own challenges.

Similarly, applications which incorporate an element of natural language generation or realization need to preserve prepositions in the interests of producing well-formed outputs. Riloff (1995) challenged the validity of the stop-word philosophy for text classification, and demonstrated that dependency tuples incorporating prepositions are a more effective document representation than simple words. In a direct challenge to the prevalent “stop word” perception of prepositions in information retrieval, Hansen (2005) and Lassen (2006) placed emphasis on not only prepositions but preposition semantics in a music retrieval system and ontology-based text search system, respectively. Information extraction is one application where prepositions are uncontroversially crucial to system accuracy, in terms of the role they play in named entities (Cucchiarelli and Velardi 2001; Toral 2005; Kozareva 2006) and in IE patterns, in linking the elements in a text (Appelt et al. 1993; Muslea 1999; Ono et al. 2001; Leroy and Chen 2002).

Levi (1978) pioneered the use of prepositions as a means of interpreting compound nouns, through the notion of compatibility with paraphrases incorporating prepositions. For example, baby chair can be paraphrased as chair for (a) baby, indicating compatibility with the FOR class. In her original research, Levi used four prepositions, in combination with a set of verbs (for relative clause paraphrases) and semantic roles (for nominalizations). Lauer (1995) extended this research in developing an exclusively preposition-based set of seven semantic classes. For example, Levi would interpret truck driver as PATIENT, in the sense that truck is the patient of the underlying verb of the head noun to drive, whereas Lauer would interpret it as OF (c.f., driver of (the) truck). Girju (2007, 2009) leveraged translation data to improve the accuracy of compound noun interpretation, based on the observation that the choice of preposition in Romance languages is often indicative of the semantics of the compound noun.

There have been a number of attempts to model the compositionality of VPCs. Bannard (2005, 2006) considered VPC compositionality at the component word level, and proposed a distributional approach that assumes there is a positive correlation between compositionality and the distributional similarity of each component to simplex usages of that same word. McCarthy, Keller, and Carroll (2003) opted for a holistic notion of compositionality and used a range of approaches based on the distributional “thesaurus” of Lin (1998) to model compositionality, for example, in calculating the overlap in the top-N similar words for a given VPC and its head verb.

As such, we will focus our discussion predominantly on this syntactic context. To simplify discussion, we will refer to the verb as v, the head noun of the immediately proceeding NP as n1, the preposition as p, and the head noun of the NP object of the preposition as n2. Returning to our earlier example, the corresponding 4-tuple is (eatv, pizzan1, withp, chopsticksn2). The high degree of interest in PP attachment stems from it being a common phenomenon when parsing languages such as English, and hence a major cause of parser errors (Lin 2003). As such, it has implications for any task requiring full syntactic analysis or a notion of constituency, such as prosodic phrasing (van Herwijnen et al. 2003). Languages other than English with PP attachment ambiguity which have been the target of research include Dutch (van Herwijnen et al. 2003), French (Gaussier and Cancedda 2001; Gala and Lafourcade 2005), German (Hartrumpf 1999; Volk 2001, 2003; Foth and Menzel 2006), Spanish (Calvo, Gelbukh, and Kilgarriff 2005), and Swedish (Kokkinakis 2000; Aasa 2004; Volk 2006).

Ye and Baldwin (2006) also built on the earlier research, in attempting to enhance the accuracy of semantic role labeling with dedicated PP disambiguation. 131 Computational Linguistics Volume 35, Number 2 They demonstrated the potential for accurate preposition labeling to contribute to largescale improvements in overall semantic role labeling performance. As mentioned in Section 3.2, Litkowski and Hargraves (2007) ran a task on the WSD of prepositions at SemEval 2007, as a spinoff of the Preposition Project. The task focused on 34 prepositions, with a combined total of 332 senses. Similarly to a lexical sample WSD task, participants were required to disambiguate token instances of each preposition relative to the provided discrete sense inventory. Three teams participated in the task (Popescu, Tonelli, and Pianta 2007; Ye and Baldwin 2007; Yuret 2007), with all systems outperforming two baselines over both fine- and coarse-grained sense inventories, through various combinations of lexical, syntactic, a</context>

We hope that variants of the RRR data set from Atterer and Sch¨utze (2007) and Agirre, Baldwin, and Martinez (2008) will reinvigorate interest in PP attachment, in a situated parsing context. Similarly, the emergence of resources such as the Preposition Project, and the data set made available for the SemEval 2007 task on the word sense disambiguation of prepositions (Litkowski and Hargraves 2007), provide the means for more detailed analysis of preposition semantics. In addition to standalone word sense disambiguation tasks, however, there needs to be more research on the interaction of preposition semantics with other semantic tasks, such as semantic role labeling and the word sense disambiguation of content words. The increasing availability of large-scale parallel corpora paves the way for crosslinguistic research on preposition syntax. Areas of particular promise in this regard are methods for generating prepositions in MT, and automatic error correction of preposition usage in no</context>

Two large areas of research on the syntactic aspects of prepositions are (a) PPattachment and (b) prepositions in multiword expressions, which are discussed in the following sections. Although this article will focus largely on the syntax of prepositions in English, prepositions in other languages naturally have their own challenges. Notable examples which have been the target of research in computational linguistics are adpositions in Estonian (Muischnek, M¨u¨urisep, and Puolakainen 2005), adpositions in Finnish (Lestrade 2006), short and long prepositions in Polish (Tseng 2004), and the Fr</context>

Preposition selection is important in any NLP application that operates at the syntax–semantics interface, that is, that overtly translates surface strings onto semantic representations, or vice versa (e.g., information extraction or machine translation using some form of interlingua). It forms a core component of subcategorization learning (Manning 1993; Briscoe and Carroll 1997; Korhonen 2002), and poses considerable challenges when developing language resources with syntactico-semantic mark-up (Kipper, Snyder, and Palmer 2004). Prepositions can occur with either intransitive or transitive valence. Intransitive prepositions (often referred to as “particles”) are valence-saturated, and as such do not take arguments. They occur most commonly as: (a) components of larger multiword expressions (e.g., verb particle constructions, such as pick it up), (b) copular predicates (e.g., the doctor is in), or (c) prenominal modifiers (e.g., an off day).</context>

The main challenge for formal approaches to the semantics of temporal prepositions is coming up with a representation which can adequately encode the different semantics of temporal prepositions (Bennett 1975; Miller and Johnson-Laird 1976; R¨ohrer 1977; Kamp 1981; Allen 1984; Richards et al. 1989; Br´ee and Smit 1986; Durrell and Br´ee 1993). Another concern has been the ability to support compositional semantic interpretation of temporal PPs, with emphasis on their quantificational role. For English, Pratt and Francez (1997), for instance, proposed generalized temporal quantifiers to represent temporal NPs, temporal PPs, and sentences. With respect to spatial semantics, the focus of research has been on devising formal semantic representations that capture both the functional relationships between the objects, and human inter</context>

Information extraction is one application where prepositions are uncontroversially crucial to system accuracy, in terms of the role they play in named entities (Cucchiarelli and Velardi 2001; Toral 2005; Kozareva 2006) and in IE patterns, in linking the elements in a text (Appelt et al. 1993; Muslea 1999; Ono et al. 2001; Leroy and Chen 2002).

First, a representation must be arrived at which is sufficiently expressive to encode the syntactic subtleties of each MWE instance (Sag et al. 2002; Calzolari et al. 2002; Copestake et al. 2002; Odijk 2004).

Kipper, Snyder, and Palmer (2004, page 23) elegantly summarized this third position as “it is precisely because the preposition–semantics relationship is so complex that properly accounting for it will lead to a more robust natural language resource.” Turning the clock back 16 years, Zelinski-Wibbelt (1993, page 1) observed that “we are now witnessing a veritable plethora of investigations into the semantics of p</context>

In other work, Sablayrolles (1995) classified 199 simple and complex spatial prepositions into 16 classes. Lersundi and Agirre (2003) applied a similar methodology to Dorr and Habash (2002) in developing a multilingual sense inventory for Basque postpositions and English and Spanish prepositions. Fort and Guillaume (2007) developed a syntactico-semantic lexicon of French prepositions, partly based on PrepNet; their particular interest was in enhancing parsing performance. Old (2003) analyzed Roget’s Thesaurus and arrived at the conclusion that it was not a good source of standalone preposition semantics. Beavers (2003) analyzed the aspectual and path properties of goal-marking postpositions in Japanese, and proposed an analysis based on predicate and event restrictions. Boonthum, Toida, and Levinstein (2005, 2006) defined a generalpurpose sense inventory of seven prepositions (but purportedly applicable to all prepositions), taking the LCS lexicon as a starting point and expanding the sense inventory by consulting Quirk et al.

Taking a different approach to the task, Patrick and Fletcher (2005) classified token instances of verb–preposition pairs according to the three classes of decomposable (syntactic dependence between the P and V, with compositional semantics), non-decomposable (syntactic dependence between the P and V, with idiomatic semantics), and independent (no syntactic dependence between the P and V). Levi (1978) pioneered the use of prepositions as a means of interpreting compound nouns, through the notion of compatibility with paraphrases incorporating prepositions.

There have been a number of attempts to model the compositionality of VPCs. Bannard (2005, 2006) considered VPC compositionality at the component word level, and proposed a distributional approach that assumes there is a positive correlation between compositionality and the distributional similarity of each component to simplex usages of that same word. McCarthy, Keller, and Carroll (2003) opted for a holistic notion of compositionality and used a range of approaches based on the distributional “thesaurus” of Lin (1998) to model compositionality, for example, in calculating the overlap in the top-N similar words for a given VPC and its head verb. They also examined the use of statistical tests such as mutual information in modeling compositionality, and found the similarity-based methods to correlate more highly with the human judgments.

In terms of English PV extraction, Baldwin (2005b) proposed a method based on a combination of statistical measures and linguistic diagnostics, and demonstrated that the combination of statistics with linguistic diagnostics achieved the best extraction performance. Research on prepositional MWEs in languages other than English includes Krenn and Evert (2001) and Evert and Krenn (2005) on the extraction of German PP–verb collocations (which are similar to verbal idioms/verb–noun combinations in English [Fazly, Cook, and Stevenson 2009]) based on a range of lexical association measures. Pecina (2008) further extended this work using a much broader set of lexical association measures and classifier combination. Looking at German, D¨omges et al.

Late Attachment, on the other hand, was the strategy of attaching “low” in the parse tree, corresponding to Example (2).

The main challenge for formal approaches to the semantics of temporal prepositions is coming up with a representation which can adequately encode the different semantics of temporal prepositions (Bennett 1975; Miller and Johnson-Laird 1976; R¨ohrer 1977; Kamp 1981; Allen 1984; Richards et al. 1989; Br´ee and Smit 1986; Durrell and Br´ee 1993). Another concern has been the ability to support compositional semantic interpretation of temporal PPs, with emphasis on their quantificational role. For English, Pratt and Francez (1997), for instance, proposed generalized temporal quantifiers to represent temporal NPs, temporal PPs, and sentences. With respect to spatial semantics, the focus of research has been on devising formal semantic representations that capture both the functional relationships between the objects, and human interaction with those objects. Along these lines, Kelleher and Costello (2009) propose computational models of spatial preposition semantics for use in visually situated dialogue systems.

Mitchell (2004) similarly performed an extensive analysis of the Penn Treebank to investigate the different contexts PP attachment ambiguities occur in, and the relative ability of different PP attachment methods to disambiguate each. There have also been domain-specific methods proposed for PP attachment, for example, in the area of biomedicine (Hahn, Romacker, and Schulz 2002; Pustejovsky et al. 2002; Leroy, Chen, and Martinez 2003; Schuman and Bergler 2006). 2.2 The Syntax of Prepositional Multiword Expressions Prepositions are also often found as part of multiword expressions (MWEs), such as verb-particle constructions (break down), prepositional verbs (rely on), determinerless PPs (in hospital), complex prepositions (by means of) and compound nominals (affairs of state).

Girju (2007, 2009) leveraged translation data to improve the accuracy of compound noun interpretation, based on the observation that the choice of preposition in Romance languages is often indicative of the semantics of the compound noun. Conversely, Johnston and Busa (1996) used Qualia structure from the Generative Lexicon (Pustejovsky 1995) to interpret the prepositions in Italian complex nominals, such as macchina da corsa ”race car”. Jensen and Nilsson (2003) used (Danish) prepositions as the basis of a finite set of role relations with which to describe the meaning content of nominals, and demonstrated the utility of the resultant ontology in disambiguating nominal phrases. 4.

The Preposition Project (Litkowski 2002; Litkowski and Hargraves 2005, 2006) is an attempt to develop a comprehensive semantic database for English prepositions, intended for NLP applications. The project took the New Oxford Dictionary of English (Pearsall 1998) as its source of preposition sense definitions, which it then fine-tuned based on cross-comparison with both functionally tagged prepositions in FrameNet (Baker, Fillmore, and Lowe 1998) and the account of preposition semantics in a descriptive grammar of English (Quirk et al. 1985); it also draws partially on Dorr’s LCS definitions of prepositions. Importantly, the Preposition Project is building up a significant number of tagged preposition instances through analysis of the preposition data in FrameNet, which it then uses to characterize the noun selectional preferences of each preposition sense and also the attachment properties to verbs of different types. At the time of writing, 673 preposition senses for 334 prepositions (mostly phrasal prepositions) have been annotated.

Old (2003) analyzed Roget’s Thesaurus and arrived at the conclusion that it was not a good source of standalone preposition semantics. Beavers (2003) analyzed the aspectual and path properties of goal-marking postpositions in Japanese, and proposed an analysis based on predicate and event restrictions. Boonthum, Toida, and Levinstein (2005, 2006) defined a generalpurpose sense inventory of seven prepositions (but purportedly applicable to all prepositions), taking the LCS lexicon as a starting point and expanding the sense inventory by consulting Quirk et al. (1985) and Barker (1996). Finally, as part of a more general attempt to capture lexical semantics in the formalism of Multilayered Extended Semantic Networks (MultiNet), Helbig (2006) developed a semantic treatment of prepositions, focusing primarily on German. There has historically been a strong interest in preposition semantics in the field of cognitive linguistics (Talmy 1988), in the form of “schemas.” Schemas are an attempt to visualize the relation between the object of the preposition (the Trajector, or TR) and its cognitive context (the Landmark, or LM).

Applications Prepositions have tended to be overlooked in NLP applications, but there have been isolated examples of prepositions being shown to be worthy of dedicated treatment. In particular, applications requiring some level of syntactic abstraction tend to benefit from 133 Computational Linguistics Volume 35, Number 2 the inclusion of prepositions. Similarly, applications which incorporate an element of natural language generation or realization need to preserve prepositions in the interests of producing well-formed outputs. Riloff (1995) challenged the validity of the stop-word philosophy for text classification, and demonstrated that dependency tuples incorporating prepositions are a more effective document representation than simple words. In a direct challenge to the prevalent “stop word” perception of prepositions in information retrieval, Hansen (2005) and Lassen (2006) placed emphasis on not only prepositions but preposition semantics in a music retrieval system and ontology-based text search system, respectively. Information extraction is one application where prepositions are uncontroversially crucial to system accura</context>

MWEs are lexical items which are composed of more than one word and are lexically, syntactically, semantically, pragmatically, and/or statistically idiosyncratic in some way (Sag et al. 2002). In this section, we present a brief overview of the syntax of the key prepositional MWEs in English, and discuss a cross-section of some of the recent research done in the area. Prepositional MWEs span the full spectrum of morphosyntactic variation. Some complex prepositions undergo no inflection, internal modification, or word order variation (e.g., in addition to) and are best analyzed as “words with spaces” (Sag et al. 2002). Others optionally allow internal modification (e.g., with [due/particular/special/...] regard to) or determiner insertion (e.g., on [the] top of) and are considered </context>
<context position="23491" citStr="Sag et al. 2002" startWordPosition="3584" endWordPosition="3587">in English, in terms of their relative frequency and tendency for syntactic variation, are: 1. verb-particle constructions (VPCs), where the verb selects for an intransitive preposition (e.g., chicken out or hand in: Deh´e et al. [2002]); 2. prepositional verbs (PVs), where the verb selects for a transitive preposition (e.g., rely on or refer to: Huddleston and Pullum [2002]); 3. determinerless PPs (PP–Ds), where a PP is made up of a preposition and singular noun without a determiner (e.g., at school, off screen: Baldwin et al. [2006]). All three MWE types undergo limited syntactic variation (Sag et al. 2002). For example, transitive verb particle constructions generally undergo the particle alternation, 125 Computational Linguistics Volume 35, Number 2 whereby the particle may occur either adjacent to the verb (e.g., tear up the letter), or be separated from the verb by the NP complement (e.g., tear the letter up). Some VPCs readily occur with both orders (like tear up), while others have a strong preference for a particular order (e.g., take off—under the interpretation of having the day off—tends to occur in the particle-final configuration in usages such as take Friday off vs. ?take off Friday</context>
<context position="27942" citStr="Sag et al. 2002" startWordPosition="4272" endWordPosition="4275"> analysis is, of course, correct. 4 The question of whether or not a particle can be separated from the verb depends on factors such as the degree of bonding of the particle with the verb, the size of the NP, and the type of the NP, as discussed by Wasow (2002). 126 Baldwin, Kordoni, and Villavicencio A Survey of Prepositions in Applications Related to this is the issue of resource development, especially lexicon development for linguistically motivated parsers. First, a representation must be arrived at which is sufficiently expressive to encode the syntactic subtleties of each MWE instance (Sag et al. 2002; Calzolari et al. 2002; Copestake et al. 2002; Odijk 2004). Second, the lexicon must be populated in order to ensure adequate parser coverage over prepositional MWEs. Due to the high productivity and domain specificity of prepositional MWEs, a number of lexical acquisition approaches have been developed, usually customized to a particular prepositional MWE type in a specific language. For VPCs in English, for instance, Baldwin and Villavicencio (2002) focused on their automatic extraction from raw text corpora, on the basis of a POS tagger, chunker, and chunk grammar, and finally the combined</context>

In addition to standalone word sense disambiguation tasks, however, there needs to be more research on the interaction of preposition semantics with other semantic tasks, such as semantic role labeling and the word sense disambiguation of content words. The increasing availability of large-scale parallel corpora paves the way for crosslinguistic research on preposition syntax. Areas of particular promise in this regard are methods for generating prepositions in MT, and automatic error correction of preposition usage in non-native speaker text. Following the lead of Saint-Dizier (2006b), Jørgensen and Lønning (2009), and others, we also hope to see more crosslinguistic and typological research on the lexical semantics of prepositions. Although there has been a steady proliferation of WordNets for different languages, linked variously to English WordNet (e.g., EuroWordNet for several European languages [Vossen 1998], BALKANET for Balkan languages [Stamou et al. 2002], HowNet for Chinese [Dong and Dong 2006], and Japanese WordNet for Japanese [Isahara et al. 2008]), they have tended to follow the lead of English WordNet and focus exclusively on content words.

Mitchell (2004) similarly performed an extensive analysis of the Penn Treebank to investigate the different contexts PP attachment ambiguities occur in, and the relative ability of different PP attachment methods to disambiguate each.

Areas of particular promise in this regard are methods for generating prepositions in MT, and automatic error correction of preposition usage in non-native speaker text. Following the lead of Saint-Dizier (2006b), Jørgensen and Lønning (2009), and others, we also hope to see more crosslinguistic and typological research on the lexical semantics of prepositions. Although there has been a steady proliferation of WordNets for different languages, linked variously to English WordNet (e.g., EuroWordNet for several European languages [Vossen 1998], BALKANET for Balkan languages [Stamou et al. 2002], HowNet for Chinese [Dong and Dong 2006], and Japanese WordNet for Japanese [Isahara et al. 2008]), they have tended to follow the lead of English WordNet and focus exclusively on content words. Given the increasing maturity of resources such as the Preposition Project and PrepNet, the time seems right to develop preposition sense inventories for more languages, linked back to English. On the basis of currently available resources and future efforts such as these, we believe there will be a steady lowering of the barrier to including a more systematic handling of prepositions in NLP applicat</context>

Finally, as part of a more general attempt to capture lexical semantics in the formalism of Multilayered Extended Semantic Networks (MultiNet), Helbig (2006) developed a semantic treatment of prepositions, focusing primarily on German. There has historically been a strong interest in preposition semantics in the field of cognitive linguistics (Talmy 1988), in the form of “schemas.” Schemas are an attempt to visualize the relation between the object of the preposition (the Trajector, or TR) and its cognitive context (the Landmark, or LM). They provide a language-independent representation, and have been used to analyze crosslinguistic correspondences in preposition semantics. For example, Tyler and Evans (2003)used schemas to capture the semantics of English prepositions, arguing that all meanings are grounded in human spatio-physical experience.

In a direct challenge to the prevalent “stop word” perception of prepositions in information retrieval, Hansen (2005) and Lassen (2006) placed emphasis on not only prepositions but preposition semantics in a music retrieval system and ontology-based text search system, respectively. Information extraction is one application where prepositions are uncontroversially crucial to system accuracy, in terms of the role they play in named entities (Cucchiarelli and Velardi 2001; Toral 2005; Kozareva 2006) and in IE patterns, in linking the elements in a text (Appelt et al. 1993; Muslea 1999; Ono et al. 2001; Leroy and Chen 2002).

In the context of cross-language question answering (CLQA), Hartrumpf, Helbig, and Osswald (2006) used MultiNet to interpret the semantics of German prepositions, and demonstrated that in instances where the answer passage contained a different preposition to that included in the original question, preposition semantics boosted the performance of their CLQA system.

His results indicated higher correlation when valence specification is used, suggesting not only that there is a significant difference in semantics between transitive and intransitive usages of a given preposition, but that it is sufficiently marked in the context of use that distributional methods are able to pick up on it. Cook and Stevenson (2006) developed a four-way classification of the semantics of up in VPCs based on cognitive grammar, and classified token instances based on a combination of linguistic and word co-occurrence features. In a machine translation context, Trujillo (1995) used selectional preferences and unification to perform target language disambiguation over his classification of spatial prepositions.

Finally, we outline the contributions of the papers included in this special issue (Section 5) and conclude with a discussion of research areas relevant to prepositions which we believe are ripe for further exploration (Section 6). 2. Syntax There has been a tendency for prepositions to be largely ignored in the area of syntactic research as “an annoying little surface peculiarity” (Jackendoff 1973, page 345). In computational terms, the two most important syntactic considerations with prepositions are: (1) selection (Fillmore 1968; Bennett 1975; Tseng 2000; Kracht 2003), and (2) valence (Huddleston and Pullum 2002). Selection is the property of a preposition being subcategorized/specified by the governor (usually a verb) as part of its argument structure. An example of a selected preposition is with in dispense with introductions, where introductions is the object of the verb dispense, but must be realized in a prepositional phrase headed by with (c.f. *dispense introductions).

Semantics There are three diametrically opposed views to the semantics of prepositions: (1) prepositions are semantically vacuous and unworthy of semantic representation (a view commonly subscribed to in the information retrieval community: Baeza-Yates and Ribeiro-Neto [1999], Manning, Raghavan, and Sch¨utze [2008]); (2) preposition semantics is a function of the words that select them and they in turn select, such that it is impossible to devise a standalone semantic characterization of preposition semantics (Tseng 2000; Old 2003); and (3) prepositional semantics is complex but can be captured in a standalone resource (Kipper, Dang, and Palmer 2000; Saint-Dizier and Vazquez 2001; Litkowski and Hargraves 2005). Kipper, Snyder, and Palmer (2004, page 23) elegantly summarized this third position as “it is precisely because the preposition–semantics relationship is so complex that properly accounting for it will lead to a more robust natural language resource.” Turning the clock back 16 years, Zelinski-Wibbelt (1993, page 1) observed that “we are now witnessing a veritable plethora of investigations into the sem</context>

There has historically been a strong interest in preposition semantics in the field of cognitive linguistics (Talmy 1988), in the form of “schemas.” Schemas are an attempt to visualize the relation between the object of the preposition (the Trajector, or TR) and its cognitive context (the Landmark, or LM). They provide a language-independent representation, and have been used to analyze crosslinguistic correspondences in preposition semantics. For example, Tyler and Evans (2003)used schemas to capture the semantics of English prepositions, arguing that all meanings are grounded in human spatio-physical experience. Schemas have also been used as the basis of crosslinguistic analysis of preposition semantics, for example, by Brala (2000) to describe the senses of on and in in English and Croatian, Kna´s (2006) to motivate a sense inventory for at in English and Polish, and Cosme and Gilquin (2008) to contrast with and avec in English and French.

Baldwin (2005a) expanded on this work to extract VPCs complete with valence information, to produce a fully specified lexical item. In both cases, it was found that 100% recall was extremely hard to achieve due to the power-law distribution of VPC token frequencies in corpus data. That is, around half of the VPC lexical items found in pre-existing lexical resources occurred in the BNC at most 2 times. Villavicencio (2005, 2006) took a different approach, in observing that VPCs occur productively in semantically coherent clusters, based on (near-)synonymy of the head verb (e.g., clear/clean/drain up and break/rip/cut/tear up). As a result, she expanded a seed set of VPCs based on class-based verb semantic information, and used Web-based statistics to filter false positives out of the resultant VPC candidate set. Li et al. (2003) looked at the task of VPC identification rather than extraction, namely, identifying each individual VPC token instance in corpus data, based on a set of hand-crafted regular expressio</context>

There have been a number of attempts to model the compositionality of VPCs. Bannard (2005, 2006) considered VPC compositionality at the component word level, and proposed a distributional approach that assumes there is a positive correlation between compositionality and the distributional similarity of each component to simplex usages of that same word. McCarthy, Keller, and Carroll (2003) opted for a holistic notion of compositionality and used a range of approaches based on the distributional “thesaurus” of Lin (1998) to model compositionality, for example, in calculating the overlap in the top-N similar words for a given VPC and its head verb. They also examined the use of statistical tests such as mutual information in modeling compositionality, and found the similarity-based methods to correlate more highly with the human judgments. Baldwin et al.

For example, Xu and Badler (2000) developed a geometric definition of the motion trajectories of prepositions, whereas Tokunaga, Koyama, and Saito (2005) use potential functions to estimate the spatial extent of Japanese spatial nouns (which combine with postpositions to have a similar syntactic and semantic profile to English spatial prepositions).

As mentioned in Section 3.2, Litkowski and Hargraves (2007) ran a task on the WSD of prepositions at SemEval 2007, as a spinoff of the Preposition Project. The task focused on 34 prepositions, with a combined total of 332 senses. Similarly to a lexical sample WSD task, participants were required to disambiguate token instances of each preposition relative to the provided discrete sense inventory. Three teams participated in the task (Popescu, Tonelli, and Pianta 2007; Ye and Baldwin 2007; Yuret 2007), with all systems outperforming two baselines over both fine- and coarse-grained sense inventories, through various combinations of lexical, syntactic, and semantic features. The bestperforming system achieved F-scores of 0.818 and 0.861 over fine- and coarse-grained senses, respectively (Ye and Baldwin 2007). In other papers dedicated to prepositional WSD, Boonthum, Toida, and Levinstein (2005, 2006) proposed a semantic collocation-based approach to preposition interpretation, and demonstrated the import of the method in a paraphrase recognition task.

In addition to the four lexical and class-based features provided by the 4-tuple (v, n1, p, n2), researchers have used noun definiteness, distributional similarity, noun number, subcategorization categories, word proximity in corpus data, and PP semantic class (Stetina and Nagao 1997; Yeh and Vilain 1998; Pantel and Lin 2000; Volk 2002). The empirical benchmark for the data set was achieved by Stetina and Nagao (1997), who used WordNet (Fellbaum 1998) to explicitly model verb and noun semantics. In a novel approach to the task, Schwartz, Aikawa, and Quirk (2003) observed that Japanese translations of English verb and noun attachment involve distinct constructions. This allowed them to automatically identify instances of PP attachment ambiguity in a parallel English–Japanese corpus, complete with attachment information. They used this data to disambiguate PP attachment in English inputs, and d</context>

This suggested that computational research on PP attachment resolution needed to take into account the discourse context, in addition to syntax and world knowledge. Spivey-Knowlton and Sedivy (1995) later used psycholinguistic experiments to demonstrate that verbspecific attachment properties and NP definiteness both play important roles in the human processing of PP attachment. Importantly, this work motivated the need for verb classes to resolve PP attachment ambiguity. The next significant shift in NLP research on PP attachment was brought about by Hindle and Rooth (1993), who were the harbingers of statistical NLP and large-scale empirical evaluation. Hindle and Rooth challenged the prevailing view at the time that lexical semantics and/or discourse modeling were needed to resolve PP attachment, in proposing a distributional approach, based simply on estimation of the probability of p attaching high or low given v and n1 (ignoring n2). The method uses unambiguous cases of PP attachment (e.g., cases of n1 being a pronoun [high attachment], or the PP post-modifying n1 in subject position [low attachment]) to derive smoothed estimates of Prhigh(p|v), Prhigh(NULL</context>

Furlan, Baldwin, and Klippel (2007) used preposition occurrence in Web data as a means of classifying landmarks for use in route directions. Finally, Kelleher and Costello (2009) proposed computational models of topological and projective spatial prepositions for use in a visually situated dialogue system. In the field of machine translation (MT), spatial and temporal prepositions have received a moderate amount of attention, particularly in the context of interlinguaand transfer-based MT. Dorr and Voss (1993) mapped prepositions onto 5-place spatial 134 Baldwin, Kordoni, and Villavicencio A Survey of Prepositions in Applications predicates in the context of interlingua-based MT, building on the work of Talmy (1985) and Jackendoff (1983, 1990). N¨ubel (1996) developed a set of interlingual predicates for adjunct PPs in EnglishHGerman MT, incorporating a dialogue component which can be used to disambiguate prepositions relative to the discourse context.

The general framework established by Ratnaparkhi, Reynar, and Roukos (1994), and the RRR data set, defined the task of PP attachment for over a decade. It has been tackled using a variety of smoothing methods and machine learning algorithms, including backed-off estimation (Collins and Brooks 1995), instance-based learning (Zavrel, Daelemans, and Veenstra 1997; Zhao and Lin 2004), log-linear models (Franz 1996), maximum entropy learning (Ratnaparkhi, Reynar, and Roukos 1994), decision trees (Merlo, Crocker, and Berthouzoz 1997), neural networks (Sopena, Lloberas, and Moliner 1998; Alegre, Sopena, and Lloberas 1999), and boosting (Abney, Schapire, and Singer 1999).
