Italian object clitics can be involved in nonlocal de-
pendencies in the sense that they must/may appear
on a verbal head of which they are not an argument.
Two cases where this situation arises will be dis-
cussed: the first is due to the presence of an auxiliary
verb and the second is triggered by the presence of a
certain class of verbs that allows clitic climbing.
An analysis will be proposed within the framework
of Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar [Pollard
and Sag, 1987; Pollard and Sag, 1993]; it can be
shown that an analysis in terms of nonlocal fea-
tures and the Nonlocal Feature Principle, which is
the mechanism provided by HPSG to deal with non-
local dependencies, does not provide a satisfactory
account of the phenomenon; it is too powerful. An
alternative approach will be proposed; it is based on
the idea that the arguments of a verb which is gov-
erned by an auxiliary or clitic climbing trigger verb
can be raised to become arguments of the governor
by a mechanism that achieves an effect similar to
functional composition as developed within the tra-
dition of Categorial Grammar. This approach is able
to capture the right generalizations, to account for
the relevant data and can be easily extended to ac-
count for long NP-movement which is another prop-
erty of clitic climbing trigger verbs.

2 Some linguistic properties of
Italian clitics
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999238368421053">
There are arguments similar to the ones proposed by
[Miller, 1992a] for French showing that Italian clitics
exhibit many properties that make them very simi-
lar to inflectional affixes; the arguments are mainly
based on [Zwicky and Pullum, 1983]. The coordina-
tion criteria proposed by [Miller, 1992b] can also be
used to support this position.
Italian clitics exhibit a high degree of selection
with respect to their host; they can only attach to
verbs.
They present arbitrary gaps in their combination,
since not all the combinations are allowed, behaving
therefore like affixes; in particular, it is not possi-
ble to have a first or second person accusative clitic
together with a dative one.
Italian clitics also exhibit morphophonological id-
iosyncrasies: vowel deletion occurs when clitics like
lo and la occur in front of a vowel initial stem. This
applies also to mi, ti, ci, vi, li and Si; but mainly in

spoken language. Certain changes also occur when
more than one clitic is present, namely the final -i
of a clitic is changed into -e if it is followed by an-
other clitic which begins with 1- or n-. Sequencing of
identical clitics is not permitted in Italian, therefore
certain changes occur as in the combination of two
si or of two vi where one becomes ci. Furthermore,
if the third person dative feminine clitic le precedes
a clitic beginning with 1- or n-, the masculine dative
form gli is used instead of the feminine one.
Other evidence for the affixal status of clitics
comes from coordination. Italian clitics cannot have
wide scope over coordination of verbs; the following
is not possible:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.751439">
(1) * Maria lo comprera&apos; e leggera&apos;
Maria cl.(acc) will buy and will read
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.979872833333333">
&apos;Maria will buy and read it&apos;
The clitic should be repeated in front of each verb
behaving like an affix according to the coordination
criterium developed by [Miller, 1992b].
Italian clitics are rigidly ordered in a flat clitic clus-
ter, adhering to the following ordering:

&lt; ne
Rigid ordering of elements has often been related to
the status of morphological affix.
The data presented above show evidence in favour
of an analysis of Italian pronominal clitics as inflec-
tional affixes;&apos; this will be the assumption underlying
both of the analyses which will be presented in the
following sections.
As already mentioned above, Italian clitics cluster
around the verb; they precede it if the verb is finite
and follow it if the verb is non-finite or an imperative.
If there is an auxiliary, the clitic doesn&apos;t attach to
the verb that subcategorizes for it, but cliticizes to
the auxiliary as in:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.775515333333333">

&apos;Maria has eaten it&apos;
</listItem>
<tableCaption confidence="0.939464">
&apos;Italian claim can appear both in proclitic and in en-
clitic position; it could be argued that this alternation is
not typical of affixes. Data from Afar, Swazi and Ara-
bic show that in these languages there are dual position
affixes.
</tableCaption>
<page confidence="0.998919">

<bodyText confidence="0.999742">
If in the main clause there is a restructuring verb
[Rizzi, 1982], namely a verb which belongs to one of
the following classes: modals, temporal aspectu-
als, pure motion verbs, the clitic can attach to
the main verb, but it can also attach to the verb in
the embedded sentence:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.839915">
(4) a. Maria lo vuole comprare
Maria cl.(acc) wants to buy
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.866955833333333">
&apos;Maria wants to buy it&apos;
b. Maria vuole comprarlo
Maria wants to buy cl.(acc)
&apos;Maria wants to buy it&apos;
If there is more than one verb that belongs to one of
the classes mentioned above, the clitic can attach to
the lower verb or climb to the middle position or all
the way up.
Since clitic climbing is triggered by the restructur-
ing verbs, the following will be ungrammatical be-
cause the main verb does not belong to this class:
(5) * Maria lo decide di leggere
Maria cl.(acc) decides to read
&apos;Maria decides to read it&apos;
As for their distribution, Italian clitics are in com-
plementary distribution with full phrases as comple-
ments of a lexical head; so a sentence like the follow-
ing will not be grammatical:2
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.8874945">
(6) * Maria lo da&apos; ii libro a Giovanni
Maria cl.(acc) gives the book to Giovanni

<bodyText confidence="0.721276">

3 A treatment in terms of nonlocal
features
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.984123833333333">
As was shown by the examples in the previous sec-
tion, in certain cases a clitic corresponding to the
complement of a head is not present on that head,
but on a higher node: clitics can thus be involved in
nonlocal dependencies. HPSG has a syntactic mech-
anism to account for Unbounded Dependency Con-
structions, namely the Nonlocal Feature Princi-
ple and the use of NONLOCAL features, which are
analogous to the Foot Feature Principle and to
the FOOT features used in GPSG [Gazdar et al.,
19851. Therefore it seems a reasonable choice to use
the same mechanism to handle cases of nonlocal de-
pendencies involving clitics.3
As discussed above, Italian pronominal clitics are
in complementary distribution with full phrases as
&apos;If the full phrase is left (or right) dislocated, its cooc-
currence with a clitic pronoun is possible. See [Sanfilippo,
1990] for an analysis of this type of constructions within
the Unification Categorial Grammar framework.
3See [Monachesi, 1992] for a more detailed description
of the analysis and [Miller, 1992a] for a similar analysis of
related facts in French within a GPSG/HPSG framework.
complements of a lexical head; they must therefore
fulfill the sub categorization requirements of the head
of which they are a semantic argument. Further-
more, the information that the clitic will appear at
some point in the tree must be encoded if a verb that
triggers clitic climbing is present.
A lexical rule can be used for this purpose;4 it
will operate on the subcategorization list, removing
the slot related to the relevant full complement and
adding a nonlocal feature OC (object clitic) which
encodes case and agreement information of the clitic.
Since this is a nonlocal feature, its value can perco-
late up the tree according to the Nonlocal Feature
Principle [Pollard and Sag, 1993];
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.762101">
(7) Nonlocal Feature Principle
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99874125">
For each nonlocal feature, the INHERITED
value on the mother is the union of the IN-
HERITED values on the daughters minus the
TO-BIND value on the head daughter.
A TO-BINDIOC feature is assigned to the cliticized
verb form and will have as its value the agreement
and case information relative to the clitic. If there is
identity of values between the TO-BINDIOC feature
and the INHERIOC feature the percolation of the
latter will be stopped and the dependency will be
bound off. Therefore, for a sentence like (4a), the
following representation will be produced:
</bodyText>

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.5718555">
V [TO-BINDIOC {[1]}] VP[INIII0C MD]

This treatment can account for the following cases:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.97966825">
• cases with an auxiliary: the clitic must climb
in order to attach to it;
• cases with a verb that allows clitic climbing: the
clitic may climb to attach to it.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.947904444444445">
However, the mechanism as it has been sketched
so far will overgenerate allowing clitic climbing also
with verbs that do not trigger it; a sentence like (5)
will be accepted. It is necessary to add specific local-
ity constraints on the path of the OC feature in order
41n the framework developed in Chapter 9 of [Pollard
and Sag, 1993], lexical rules are also used in the treatment
of Unbounded Dependency Constructions to produce an
analysis that doesn&apos;t make use of empty categories.

<bodyText confidence="0.9999969">
to make the right predictions, namely the percolation
of the feature must be stopped if there is a verb that
doesn&apos;t trigger clitic climbing and must be allowed if
there is a verb that triggers clitic climbing. It seems
therefore that this approach doesn&apos;t naturally cap-
ture the fact that clitic climbing is triggered only by
a specific class of verbs since constraints need to be
imposed to obtain this result. This fact can be easily
captured by an approach in terms of functional com-
position which will be described in the next section.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.6619355" genericHeader="method">
4 A functional composition approach
to clitic climbing
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998856">
The idea that underlies the approach was originally
presented by [Hinrichs and Nakazawa, 1990] for the
treatment of the German verb cluster. They argue
that the arguments of a verb which is governed by an
auxiliary can be raised to become arguments of the
auxiliary. They achieve this by making crucial use
of the notion of structure sharing which is character-
istic of unification-based formalisms such as HPSG.
The effect is similar to functional composition as de-
veloped within Categorial Grammar.
This approach can be extended to clitics in order
to account for the clitic climbing cases producing an
analysis which captures intuitions similar to the ones
underlying a restructuring analysis [Rizzi, 1982] and
a clause reduction one [Aissen and Perlmutter, 19831
In this case, the arguments of a verb which is gov-
erned by an auxiliary or clitic climbing trigger can be
raised to become arguments of the governor. It will
be shown that the approach can handle the relevant
data concerning clitic climbing adequately and that
it can account naturally for the fact that only certain
verbs can trigger clitic climbing. Furthermore, it can
easily be extended to account for another property
of restructuring verbs, namely the possibility of al-
lowing for long NP-movement as in [Rizzi, 1982].
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99978">
4.1 The analysis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999976258064516">
The analysis is based on the assumption, previously
motivated, that Italian clitics behave in a way simi-
lar to inflectional affixes. This implies that the verb
forms a unit with the clitic and such combination
should be accounted for in the morphological mod-
ule. An account in terms of template morphology as
in [Simpson and Withgott, 1986] could handle the
rigid ordering of the clitics and the restrictions in
combination.
As discussed above, clitics and full complements
are in complementary distribution in Italian: the
clitic should fill the relevant slot in the subcatego-
rization requirements so that no full complement can
occur. On the assumption that clitics behave like
inflectional affixes and not as syntactically indepen-
dent elements, it is necessary to have a way to remove
the subcategorization slot related to the full comple-
ment if a clitic is present. The Valence princi-
ple, which is the principle of the grammar respon-
sible for checking off subcategorization requirements
that have been satisfied, cannot be used in this case
since the clitic doesn&apos;t have the status of a syntac-
tic element.5 A lexical rule (LRCL1) can be used
instead; namely given a verb that subcategorizes for
a certain argument, the argument is removed from
the subcategorization list but the equivalent clitic
must be present, attached to the verb as proposed
by [Miller and Sag, 1993] for French. The lexical rule
triggers the presence of the clitic as verb inflection
and acts as an interface to morphology. It should
look roughly as follows:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.75285">

</listItem>
<equation confidence="0.513356">
CLTS W U {X}
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9966929375">
Therefore, when the clitic attaches to the verb that
subcategorizes for it, it cliticizes on the host in the
morphological component and the relevant slot is re-
moved from the subcategorization list by means of
the lexical rule.
When clitics are involved in nonlocal dependen-
cies, namely when the clitic attaches to a head which
doesn&apos;t subcategorize for it, the argument raising
comes into play in addition to LRCL1.
This analysis will look at two cases where this sit-
uation arises: the case where an auxiliary verb is
present and the case where a restructuring verb is
present.
In this treatment, auxiliaries and verbs that trigger
clitic climbing subcategorize for a non-finite VP com-
plement and for the complements of the VP; the con-
struction of a partial VP must therefore be allowed.6
5The analysis is carried out within the framework of
Chapter 9 of [Pollard and Sag, 1993] which incorporates
innovations due to Borsley [Borsley, 1987; Borsley, 1989].
The analysis makes use of valence features which encode
the subcategorization requirements of the sign.
6This implies the parameterization for Italian of
Schema 2 in order to allow partially saturated phrases.
(Compare [Pollard, 1990]). Schema 2 describes phrases
consisting of a lexical head daughter and any number of
complement daughters. One problem which is related to
having a VP as complement is that of spurious ambigu-
ity if a non clitic complement is present. The possibility
of having a V as complement instead of a VP is under
investigation; see also [Rizzi, 1982] which postulates the
presence of a V if restructuring has applied. Under this
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.980491">
Auxiliaries should have a lexical entry like the fol-
lowing (only relevant features are mentioned):7

</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.975141441860465">
The [-CL] restriction prevents an auxiliary from com-
bining with a VP whose head has already combined
with a clitic, since all cliticized verb forms are speci-
fied as [+CL] in the lexicon. In the case of auxiliaries,
clitic climbing is obligatory and a sentence like the
following must be ruled out:
(12) * Maria ha lettolo
Maria has read cl.(acc)
&apos;Maria has read it&apos;
The [-CL] lexical specification on the VP complement
selected by the auxiliary achieves this purpose; let-
tolo will be marked as [+CL] and will consequently
not meet the specifications of the lexical entry for
auxiliaries which forces the verbal complement to be
[-CL]. Sentence (12) will be correctly ruled out. The
combination of a clitic with a past participle cannot
be ruled out in general in Italian, since the following
sentence is grammatical:
(13) Vistolo, fu facile decidere
Seenpast.part cl., was easy to decide
&apos;Having seen him, it was easy to decide&apos;
It is only when the past participle combines with the
auxiliary that the clitic must attach to the latter.
As for semantic role assignment, it proceeds in a
very straightforward way. In HPSG roles are as-
signed within the lexical entry: a role is assigned by
means of structure sharing between the index of an
element in the SUBJ/COMPS list and the value of
some attribute of the verb&apos;s CONTENT value. Role
assignment, as well as case assignment, occurs within
the lexicon. If a clitic is present, it will be assigned
semantic role and case through the link created via
structure sharing.
An example will be given to illustrate the mecha-
nism and the interaction of the two lexical rules in
hypothesis it won&apos;t be necessary to parameterize Schema
2 and the spurious ambiguity will be avoided, at least
with auxiliaries, if all complements of the past partici-
ple are forced to raise. See [Abeille and Godard, 1993]
for a similar solution for French. Furthermore, the use
of the [-CL] feature (see below) imposed on the comple-
ment of a restructuring verb is also superfluous under the
assumption that all the complements of V should raise.

The auxiliary verb takes a VP and the NP argu-

This will undergo LRCL1 to produce the following
for the cliticized verb form l&apos;ha, where the slot re-
lated to the NP is removed from the subcategoriza-
tion requirement of the auxiliary and the presence of
the clitic is imposed:

The left hand side (input) of the lexical rule accounts
for cases where the clitic doesn&apos;t climb as in sen-
tence (4b); in this case there is no argument raising
and LRCL1 applies, checking off the slot related to
the full complement and triggering the cliticized verb
form. If clitic climbing occurs as in (4a), there is ar-
gument raising and the right hand side (output) of
the lexical rule will account for it; in this specific case
the restructuring verb will subcategorize for the ver-
bal complement and for the argument of the verbal
complement. Again LRCL1 will trigger the cliticized
verb form.
Clitic climbing trigger verbs also subcategorize for
a VP [-CL]; this avoids sentences where there are
COMPS(

<bodyText confidence="0.972795208333333">
two clitics with one attaching to the lower verb and
the other to the higher one. In Italian, if there are
two clitics that originate as complements of the same
verb, they must cliticize together:
Piero voleva darmelo
Piero wanted to give cl.(dat) cl.(acc)
&apos;Piero wanted to give it to me&apos;
Piero me lo voleva dare
Piero cl.(dat) cl.(acc) wanted to give
&apos;Piero wanted to give it to me&apos;
The clitics cannot be split:
(19) * Piero lo voleva darmi
Piero cl.(acc) wanted to give cl.(dat)
&apos;Piero wanted to give it to me&apos;
The restriction on the VP doesn&apos;t allow argument
raising if the VP already has a clitic as its daugh-
ter. In the specific case of sentence (19), darmi will
be marked as [+CL] and will not match the require-
ments imposed by the right hand side of LRCL2;
therefore no argument raising will take place and the
sentence will be correctly ruled out. As for (18a) and
(18b) they will be handled by the left hand side and
by the right hand side of LRCL2 respectively. Lexi-
cal rule LRCL1 will be responsible in both cases for
the cliticized verb form.
If there is more than one restructuring verb, one
can get sequences like the following, where the clitic
is attached to the higher verb:
(20) Maria lo vuole poter comprare
Maria cl.(acc) wants can buy
&apos;Maria wants to be able to buy it&apos;
The application of lexical rule LRCL2 is therefore
triggered twice so that the higher verb will subcate-
gorize also for the complement of the lower one. Lex-
ical rule LRCL1 will be responsible for the cliticized
verb form.
An advantage of this approach is that the possi-
bility of subcategorizing for the complements of the
lower VP is restricted to auxiliary and clitic climbing
trigger verbs. Therefore a sentence like (5) will be
ruled out since the main verb is not lexically marked
as a clitic climbing trigger and will not undergo lex-
ical rule LRCL2 which allows argument raising. In
this way the fact that clitic climbing occurs only with
certain verbs can be naturally captured by the mech-
anism; only auxiliary verbs and restructuring verbs
will trigger argument raising and no special locality
constraints are necessary.

<bodyText confidence="0.997142259259259">
Restructuring verbs as in [Rizzi, 1982] not only have
the property of allowing clitic climbing, they also al-
low long NP-movement as in:
(21) Queste case si vogliono vendere a caro
These houses SI want to sell at high
prezzo
price
&apos;These houses are wanted to be sold at high
price&apos;
In this kind of construction the object of the lower
verb, queste case, is allowed to raise and become the
subject of the main verb; this option being avail-
able only with restructuring verbs. It can be shown
that a functional composition approach can easily
account for this kind of construction.8 Lexical rule
LRCL2 allows raising of the NP object of the lower
VP which becomes a complement of the restructur-
ing verb. The clitic si acts as a passivizing ele-
ment in this kind of construction and will trigger
the HPSG mechanism that handles passive construc-
tions; namely a lexical rule that acts on the subcat-
egorization requirements of the relevant verb, mak-
ing the object become the subject as in [Pollard and
Sag, 1987]. The NP object will therefore become the
subject of the restructuring verb and agreement will
be handled by the usual mechanism responsible for
subject-verb agreement.

5 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999678125">
An analysis for the treatment of clitic climbing in
Italian has been proposed. It relies on the idea that
auxiliaries and clitic climbing trigger verbs subcat-
egorize for a VP and for the raised complements of
the VP. This analysis allows a unified treatment for
the simple cases, namely when a clitic attaches to
a host that subcategorizes for it and for the cases
where clitics are involved in nonlocal dependencies.
It has been shown that the analysis rules out in-
formed sentences. It is not necessary to state specific
constraints that would be required in a treatment
based on nonlocal features and the Nonlocal Feature
Principle, which is another possible way to handle
nonlocal dependencies in HPSG. Furthermore, the
approach can easily account for another property of
restructuring verbs namely long NP-movement.
