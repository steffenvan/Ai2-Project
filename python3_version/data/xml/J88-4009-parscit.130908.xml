But the way Hirst has souped up his thesis with
general expository matter has had not altogether satis-
factory results. The textbook-like sections against
which the accounts of his own work are set treat some
topics, like structural ambiguity, at length, but do not
form a very well-balanced or comprehensive whole.
They nevertheless dilute Hirst&apos;s own work enough to
prevent the reader from experiencing that feeling of
excitement that good theses provoke, and to leave her
disappointed in not getting the fuller and more concen-
trated account of Hirst&apos;s system as such, and its perfor-
mance, she would have liked. The idea that language
interpretation involves quite disparate processes is one
deserving investigation, but it is not clear whether
Hirst&apos;s particular way of combining such different lines
as Montague and markers, via frames, is on the right
track, and his book does not compel his reader, in a Pied
Piper imperative, to follow him.

The main proposal of this book is that the motivation
behind the Japanese Fifth Generation project is not a
desire to push the barriers of computer technology
research, nor even to attain economic superiority
through advanced technology, but quite simply to over-
come the problems of the Japanese writing system. In
advancing this claim, Unger demonstrates that he is at
least well read—an impressive array of literature in both
English and Japanese is cited—and the book is well
written, although sometimes in a journalistic rather than
academic style. Despite that, this reviewer, and at least
four other informed colleagues that I have discussed
this book with, find the claim quite preposterous. The
book is an enjoyable read, in the way that the Letters
page in an extremist newspaper is sometimes enjoyable,
though I fear that only those who already have a fair
background knowledge of the issues will get very far
with it: if you don&apos;t know the difference between a kanji
and a kana, then you might find it rather hard going.
The book is divided into three sections, each of two
chapters, dealing with Japanese linguistics and orthog-
raphy, political and cultural issues, and economics and
technology. This is preceded by an Introduction which
sets the scene, actually getting the book off to a very
promising start, in which Unger virulently attacks the
typical reaction to the Fifth Generation, as exemplified
by the well-known Feigenbaum and McCorduck (1983)
book, which exhibits paranoia, misunderstanding of
Japanese attitudes to AT, the weak/strong AT debate,
and the reasons for the Fifth Generation:
What the Japanese have in mind when they speak of Al,
however, turns out to be something else yet again, and
unless one dispels the fog of strong-AI hyperbole that
surrounds the Fifth Generation project, it is impossible to
appreciate its significance. (p.4)
It never occurs to [Feigenbaum and McCorduckj that,
despite Japan&apos;s new-found affluence, its intellectual cli-
mate continues to suffer from such fundamental condi-
tions as geographical and linguistic isolation, academic
factionalism, and the overweening influence of govern-
ment bureaucracy and giant corporations. (p.5)
It is as an answer to this misunderstanding that the
remainder of the book is intended, and it begins with a
detailed description of the Japanese writing system, and
some of its practical consequences. As I suggested
above, this whole section is probably too complex for
the reader who does not know about it already, and this
complexity is not helped by the unusual approach,
starting from a romanization presented in alphabetical
order and working towards the kana rather than vice
versa. Some minor criticisms of this section would
include the fact that the term mora (roughly, the con-
sonant-plus-vowel syllable that each kana represents) is
not included in the otherwise extensive glossary; the
error (pp.21-22) of describing the Hepburn romaniza-
tion as phonemic, when it is precisely not phonemic
(e.g. /tu/ is written tsu), whereas the Cabinet (kunrei)
romanization is; and there is no mention of a third
romanization (especially used by Japanese) which is a
simple transliteration of kana, e.g. Toukyou for Tokyo.
While we are on the subject of romanization, we men-
tion also the quaint use by the publisher of the circum-
flex rather than the macron to indicate long vowels in
the Japanese transcription.
Turning to the question of kanji, it is always difficult
to convey accurately to readers used to alphabetic
writing systems the pros and cons of a radically differ-
ent orthography, and like most Western observers,
Unger overestimates the problems they cause
Computational Linguistics, Volume 14, Number 4, December 1988 93
Book Reviews The Fifth Generation Fallacy: Why Japan is Betting Its Future on Artificial Intelligence
(humans), and understates their advantages. When he
states that
one can argue from tradition for the use of kana on
computers, but any claim that they provide a better or
more accurate representation of Japanese speech is com-
pletely without merit (p.28)
he is, of course, right, but if we substitute &amp;quot;language&amp;quot;
for &amp;quot;speech&amp;quot; we do, in fact, get a fairly convincing
argument.
Unger prepares us for the contents of the second
chapter dealing with practical consequences (especially
vis a vis computers), but it is difficult to know, when he
talks of &amp;quot;technical disadvantages for data processing&amp;quot;
(p.28) or &amp;quot;considerable cost implications for computer
applications&amp;quot; (p.32) if he means for input, output, word
processing, OCR, or what, since none of these has been
mentioned explicitly up to this point
The second chapter contains some good sections on
the difficulties of ordering in dictionaries or indexes,
especially due to individual idiosyncrasies (though he
does not mention similar problems with Western dictio-
naries: are words listed in strict alphabetical order or
are compounds listed under head words?). In both
cases, humans quickly adapt, even if in Japanese it is a
bit more complex.
Unger goes on to discuss (irrelevantly) the book
trade, before turning to the much more crucial question
of typing and computer input. His description of the
different methods of kanji input (pp.64-65) is unclear,
and in general this section is very shallow on what is
clearly a vital issue. There is a wide range of people in
Japan who take a keen interest in issues surrounding the
use of word processors, which include the reticence on
the part of older senior managers (who still prefer to
pass handwritten documents to secretaries for typing,
thereby emphasizing the office hierarchy) at one end,
and the increasing use of obscure kanji made easily
available, at the other, with numerous other issues
(such as the demise of writing skills) in between. Apart
from input, the storage and output problems are again
overstated: more-or-less satisfactory solutions have
been found here, and Unger overemphasizes (p.69) the
speed and memory overheads. Regarding output, it
could be said that the concentration on graphics means
that the Japanese have had to make faster strides. If
language processing software is so problematic for the
Japanese, how is it that it is top of the list of software
registered by commercial companies (p.75), and how
does this compare with the West? Likewise, Unger
seems to shoot himself in the foot when he states that
&amp;quot;only 2% of Japanese people can operate a computer&amp;quot;
(p.76). Again, how does this compare with the West?
Unger&apos;s claim is that the Fifth Generation project was
started in order to address these problems, but the
evidence he presents suggests that the Japanese are well
on their way to overcoming them anyway.
The two chapters that make up Part 2 of this book
concern political and cultural aspects of the problem.
The first of these has a long section on literacy rates in
Japanese followed by a discussion of some of the
popular preconceptions about the writing system. The
chapter is not engrossing, and its overall relevance is
not brought out. The second chapter deals with the
alleged conflict of technologies of the writing system on
the one hand and computers on the other. Here Unger
really shows his prejudices, dismissing the survival of
the Japanese writing system over the generations as due
to superstition on the part of users, but perpetrating his
own narrow-minded superstitions making us wonder
what his experience of non-numeric computing might
be:
. . . kanji on computers waste system resources, impede
software development, and unnecessarily complicate
both computation and I/O functions. It is clearly wasteful
to use thousands of intricate symbols when a few simple
ones would suffice to convey the same information. The
fuzzy definitions of the number, use, and form of kanji
demand data-bound programs and guarantee that almost
every program that does anything more with kanji than
display them is a one-of-a-kind endeavor. Lack of a
nonarbitrary collating sequence restricts the use of sort-
ing, a fundamental step in countless applications . . . .
Kanji are a problem for computers because, by their very
nature, they lack the properties that well-behaved com-
puter data should have. (p.110)
In the third part of the book, Unger returns to the safer
ground of hard facts and discusses current language
processing technology in Chapter 5 and, finally, the
Fifth Generation in the book&apos;s last chapter. The fifth
chapter mainly concerns Japanese text input, and is
quite interesting. Little mention is made of the possibil-
ities of speech input: if some people are to be believed,
advances in this area will in any case soon make many
of Unger&apos;s concerns outdated, and, by the way, it could
be said that the phonetic structure of Japanese makes it
more amenable to speech processing than some other
languages. However, here we are concerned with text
input, of which there are three kinds distinguished by
Unger: inscriptive, transcriptive, and descriptive.
Inscriptive input is where the user manipulates a
stylus, the physical strokes being interpreted by the
machine. Although closest to the traditional form of
writing, this method is expensive and limited. One thing
Unger does not mention is that this form of input is not
useful for learners, since stroke order and weight is
crucial: it is not sufficient to produce an apparently
good copy of a kanji. OCR can also be regarded as a
kind of inscriptive input, though OCRs for Japanese are
not very robust, and handwriting is as yet out of the
question (even for English).
Transcriptive input (&amp;quot;phonetic&amp;quot; typing with kanji
conversion) is the most popular of the three, and here
the issues are whether to use Roman or kana keyboards,
the burden of shift-, control-, and alt-keying, and the
efficiency of kanji conversion. Unger is rather negative
on transcriptive input, though he overestimates the
awkwardness of double keystrokes (at least to judge

from my own observations of native Japanese users of
transcriptive input word processors). His discussion is
principally concerned with alternative keyboard lay-
outs, with rather less attention to the probably more
important and interesting problem of conversion to
kanji. Here Unger reveals his lack of familiarity with
computational linguistics, belittling the role of partial
syntactic analysis in kanji conversion. For us this is an
important factor, especially if one thinks of machine
translation, since transcriptive input with interactive
kanji conversion (the system offers a choice of—or
often a single—possible kanji for a given input se-
quence, which the user then confirms) can be seen as a
type of pre-editing: choice of kanji effectively reduces
homograph ambiguities that would otherwise further
complicate the analysis.
The third type of input is called descriptive, since the
user has to indicate the desired character via some
non-linguistic device. This includes using a stylus to
touch the appropriate cell on a tablet listing all the
available characters; assigning (hopefully) mnemonic
three-character codes to the kanji and then accessing
them via the standard 30-key keyboard (30 keys give
27,000 codes, not 2,700 as Unger states (p.157)); and
finally a technique that Unger calls &amp;quot;patternless
keyboards&amp;quot;, but which, after three readings, this re-
viewer was unable to understand (halfway through there
is a section heading &amp;quot;Romanization&amp;quot;, which seems
misplaced). There are other possibilities of descriptive
input that Unger does not mention, notably systems
requiring the user to characterize the desired kanji in
terms of its components—this might be using mnemon-
ics, as with a system I saw demonstrated at Tokyo
University, or on a workstation involving graphics, as in
the system being developed here at UMIST.
The chapter ends with an attempt to look at the costs
of kanji input, which Unger first measures by comparing
the costs of PCs that support kanji input with those that
do not: after a bit of juggling of which any &amp;quot;creative
accountant&amp;quot; would be proud and which includes disre-
garding cheap word processors (loss leaders) and ex-
pensive PCs (no reason given) and recalculating median
prices, Unger is obviously pleased to report that &amp;quot;the
overhead of look-up dictionaries and transcriptive input
software is substantial&amp;quot; (p.168).
And finally, the author deals directly with the topic
featured in the book&apos;s title. This chapter, the shortest of
the six, does contain some interesting background in-
formation about how the project was set up, but mostly
Unger is concerned once again to demonstrate his thesis
concerning the connection between the Fifth Genera-
tion project and the Japanese writing system. But in all
the citations of commentaries (by Japanese authors),
which he offers as proof, there is barely one which
really makes his point. He suggests that &amp;quot;the desire to
use kanji with complete freedom on computers was the
one technical dream that everyone involved took for
granted&amp;quot; (p.172), but in doing so seems to ignore the
large percentage of work in the project totally or largely
unrelated to kanji handling—especially work on vision,
speech, and knowledge representation. He presents a
series of quotes about the need for naive-user–friendly
human-machine interfaces over the next few pages,
consistently implying that these make his point: again
not one of them explicitly mentions kanji, and can all be
assumed to be referring to a wide range of human-
machine interface devices. Unger goes on to talk about
Japanese misunderstandings of Western AT and related
fields, perhaps with some justification, but then perpet-
uates another misunderstanding in the other direction
concerning the apparent secrecy of Japanese research-
ers: noting that results of ICOT research are rarely
published, or aired at conferences, he misses the point
that this is largely because of insufficient English: if one
can read the Japanese language conference proceedings
and journals, there is a mine of information to be had.
In conclusion, Unger talks a little about the aims of
the Fifth Generation and the dangers of its failure. Like
many commentators, he seems to suppose that the
Japanese are simply very naive about these things: why
else would they set up a 15-year project with fantasti-
cally ambitious goals? A different view is shared by
some observers, including myself: of course the Japa-
nese know that their goals are overly ambitious, and
they quite readily admit this on occasion. However,
even if they do not achieve them, they are going to
achieve a lot of things incidentally on the way, and
indeed are already doing so. And by the way, the same
is true of a similarly apparently over-ambitious project
in the machine translation field, namely the ATR tele-
phone dialogue translation research project. How many
Western governments would fund such long-term basic
research programs? A colleague commented to me
recently that he would not even know how to go about
formulating such a long-term program. Unger cites
another observer, commenting that
in one sense, it does not matter how the project turns out.
As an exercise in the politics of Japanese R&amp;D, an effort
to enlist the cooperation of government bureaucrats,
university faculty, graduate students, and the big corpo-
rations, it has already succeeded. (pp.191-192)
As a final word about this book, I note that its publica-
tion has received wide coverage in the lay press: I have
seen it reviewed already in the New York Times and in
New Scientist. But these reviews, like the book, do no
more than propagate the myths: Japanese is hard to read
and write (but English isn&apos;t?), and the Japanese collude
in this myth propagation because they like to think
foreigners can&apos;t learn their language. In this respect,
Unger&apos;s book is interesting. But the connection be-
tween this and the Fifth Generation is tenuous, and
while the title is eye-catching and may promote sales, it
is not appropriate to the content of the book. I have to
borrow from the Scottish legal system to hand down the
verdict: not proven.

Since the appearance of Tennant (1981), there have
been a number of books intended to serve as introduc-
tions to computational linguistics., including Harris
(1985), Grishman (1986), and Winograd (1983). The
book under review is directed at much the same audi-
ence and is, in my opinion, the best so far. This is not to
say that it is flawless; but its weaknesses are due more
to the nature of the subject than to any failings of the
author. (I should note, however, that I have not used it
in a course, and so cannot report on student reactions to
it.) The book is in four parts, entitled &amp;quot;Syntactic
Processing&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Semantic Interpretation&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Context and
World Knowledge&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;Response Generation&amp;quot;, sup-
plemented by two appendices, one on logic and one on
symbolic computation; each chapter ends with a set of
problems. It is broad enough in its coverage of a variety
of approaches to give the reader a sense of the field of
computational linguistics in its present state while man-
aging to avoid a mere &amp;quot;Cook&apos;s Tour&amp;quot; approach (Pullum
1984).
The author is conscientious about regularly going
into certain problems at a level of detail that makes for
more than just a superficial overview; at the same time,
the range of topics covered is sufficiently broad that
anyone wanting to base a course on a cover-to-cover
reading of the book had better have a full year in which
to do it. Allen does not discuss how to actually formu-
late algorithms in some selected language, though many
Lisp-like data structures appear throughout and the
overall perspective is quite clearly that of contemporary
Al. (The second appendix covers the essential ideas
underlying Lisp and Prolog, though without taking the
form of a primer for either language.) A nice theoretical
balance is maintained, and if there is any axe-grinding it
is exceedingly subtle.&apos;
The treatment of syntax takes context-free grammar
as the starting point and then considers both top-down
and bottom-up approaches to parsing. Two different
formalisms are pursued in some detail, namely transi-
tion networks and logic grammars, both with and with-
out augmentations that take them outside the class of
CFG-equivalent devices. One whole chapter is devoted
to handling movement, and includes discussion of how
(at the cost of increasing the size of the grammar) use of
a hold facility can be avoided by using Gazdar-style
slash categories. The problem of non-determinism is
also discussed, and there is an overview of Marcus&apos;s
parser.2
The section on semantics deals partly with represen-
tational issues (including what logical forms should look
like), partly with the specifics of designing algorithms
for semantic interpretation, and partly with a variety of
open questions (including the especially thorny problem
of correctly interpreting nominal compounds). A notion
of &amp;quot;merging&amp;quot;, closely akin to unification, is proposed as
a basic operation for semantic interpretation and a
detailed example showing the interaction of a syntactic
parser and semantic interpreter is presented.
The section on context and world knowledge deals
first with knowledge representation (a topic that is, of
course, of more than just linguistic relevance), with
problems in establishing reference, and with inferences
based on knowledge. Anaphora is dealt with in two
places, once in the chapter on reference (where the
focus is on intrasentential relations), and once in the
chapter on discourse structure (where the focus is on
&amp;quot;long-distance&amp;quot; anaphoric relations, such as the use of
a pronoun to refer to something mentioned some time
earlier in a dialog). Finally, the last part contains a
chapter on question-answering systems and one on
&amp;quot;generation&amp;quot; ,3 the latter of note in part because of the
attention it gives to systemic grammar.
I very much like the overall plan of the book (as
outlined above) and think that the level of detail into
which it goes is about right for a text of this kind. From
the organization, I infer that the presumed audience is
computer scientists with little background regarding
natural language rather than linguists with an interest in
applying what they know in a computational domain,
which seems reasonable enough: in my own introduc-
tory CL course, the former group vastly outnumbers the
latter (but then computer scientists as a group must
outnumber linguists by an astounding factor anyway). I
wonder, however, if the time is not fast approaching
when we are going to have to make some linguistics
beyond the introductory level a prerequisite for courses
in CL, which would eliminate the need for a lot of
background that Allen (and others, such as Harris) are
forced to try to cram in as best they can. My own
prejudices and disciplinary allegiances may be showing
