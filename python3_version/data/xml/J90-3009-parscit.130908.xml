The final critical remark is related to the degree of
redundancy. There are many statements that occur time
and again throughout the book. The reader often wonders
why one is being told things one already knows. It is not as
bad as in another recent dissertation from Yale (Hammond
1988), which was recently reviewed in a German AI jour-
nal (Hertzberg and Horz 1990). A translated quotation
from this review: &amp;quot;If the reader really wants to read the
complete book, she is punished and lulled to sleep by the
recurrent repetitions. . . . The sentence &apos;Plans are indexed
by the goals they satisfy and by the problems they avoid&apos; is
learned by heart just by reading any two chapters. If
Hammond is an efficient LaTeX user, he has probably
written a macro; at least, it would have been worthwhile.&amp;quot;
Once more: it is not as bad with Hovy, but it is annoying
nevertheless.
My general opinion about the book is that it is necessary
reading for anybody working in NL generation. It is profit-
able reading for anybody engaged in natural language
processing. And it is worthwhile reading for linguists spe-
cializing in pragmatics, style, or language production. I
have stated above those properties that I missed or didn&apos;t
like. What I did like was Hovy&apos;s scientific rigor in advocat-
ing the pragmatic basis of text generation. This attitude is
significant for an AI-oriented approach to language process-
ing, but this does not imply that it is a scruffy one.

The ninth volume of Kluwer&apos;s Studies in Theoretical Psycholin-
guistics is, like the previous ones, devoted to what any modern
linguistic theory has inevitably to face, namely the logical prob-
lem of language acquisition. As before, in most contributed papers
the problem is discussed within the parametrized Government-
Binding framework. This time, however, issues from formal learn-
ability theory serve as a starting point and as a basis for the
subsequent reformulation of the rationalist-empiricist debate on
language acquisition. Less general questions are also addressed;
as, for example, how children eventually succeed in avoiding
overgeneralizations—an intriguing puzzle, given the widely ac-
cepted view that not enough negative evidence is directly accessi-
ble in the course of first language learning.
No doubt the book may be of interest to cognitive scientists and
those computational linguists who deal with modeling natural
language acquisition. The idea of having a computer system that
gradually learns a language from examples, very much like people
do, is an exciting one, and it will surely receive much attention in
the foreseeable future. Though the book under consideration does
not provide the would-be designers of a computer learning system
with algorithms they might immediately employ, it presents a
wide selection of topics characteristic of the current literature on
modeling natural language acquisition and, consequently, can be
used by computational linguists as an important source of informa-
tion relevant to their research.—Mirostaw Bahko, Institute of

Tesniere&apos;s term metataxe refers to structural change in transla-
tion. In this book, a product of the DLT machine translation
project, metataxis refers to the rules required to link the depen-
dency syntaxes of two different languages for translation. The
book gives dependency syntaxes for a variety of languages—
German, Danish, Polish, Bengali, Finnish, Hungarian, Japanese,
and Esperanto—and metataxes for Esperanto to French and
English to Esperanto (Esperanto being the interlingua of the DLT
system). The emphasis is on the practical details of the grammars.

This book reviews the methodology used in the assessment of
speech recognition and synthesis systems. The text is based on a
report that was prepared as part of the ESPRIT (European
Strategic Program for Research and Development of Information
Technology) program. Thus, although the editors are all from the
University College London, the authors of the various chapters
represent a broad sample of the major speech research centers in
Europe.
The book is composed of six major chapters, with an introduc-
tion and a final note on future developments. An extensive bibliog-
raphy is included at the end, along with a glossary, an index, and
an appendix listing the project partners. The four major chapters
cover assessment of speech recognition systems (Chapter 2),
assessment of text-to-speech synthesis systems (Chapter 3), speech
databases (Chapter 4), and transcription and labeling of speech
data (Chapter 5). The last two chapters discuss applied issues
relating to tools that are useful in the development of speech
systems and management of large databases. The coverage in the
four major chapters is generally very complete. Chapter 3 on
text-to-speech is excellent.
The worst aspect of the book is its appearance; particularly the
typesetting and page formatting. The typesetting is so poor it
leads one to wonder if these people should try speech input/
output. Of course, speech I/O would obviate the typesetting
problem. The best aspect of the book is its technical content. Any
serious developer or consumer of speech technology can gain by
careful study of this book. Furthermore, the multilingual mission
of this ESPRIT project forced the authors to confront a number of
starting points.—Jared Bernstein, SRI International

Harold Somer&apos;s review of From Syntax to Semantics
(Erich Steiner et al., eds.) in Computational Linguistics
16(1) March 1990, was marred by typographical errors
that, ironically, occurred just at the point where the re-
viewer was quoting an example of bad typography in the
book under review. Hence, errors of this journal appeared
to be attributed to the book.
The paragraph in question, which appeared near the top
of page 48, should have read as follows:
Apart from jargon and unobtainable references, other
problems with the book include some disastrous typeset-
ting; notably, for example, the use of slash, bold slash,
backslash, and vertical bar in one of the formalisms (pp.
120ff ), and the nonuse of superscripts and subscripts from
time to time, as in this example:
Xn bar (Cl . . . Cm) Xn — 1 bar (Cm + 1 . . . Cn)
(where each Ci is a maximal projection or a lexical
formative)
The MIT Press apologizes for the error.
