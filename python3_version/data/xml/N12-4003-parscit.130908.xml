ABSTRACT
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.976805866666666">
The existence of dialects for any language constitutes a challenge for NLP in general
since it adds another set of variation dimensions from a known standard. The problem is
particularly interesting and challenging in Arabic and its different dialects, where the
diversion from the standard could, in some linguistic views, warrant a classification as
different languages. This problem would not be as pronounced if Modern Standard
Arabic (MSA) were the native language of some sub group of Arabic speakers, however
it is not. Any realistic and practical approach to processing Arabic will have to account
for dialectal usage since it is so pervasive. In this tutorial, we will attempt to highlight
different dialectal phenomena, how they migrate from the standard and why they pose
challenges to NLP. This area of research (dialects in general and Arabic dialects in
particular) is gaining a lot of interest. For example, the DARPA-funded BOLT program
starting this year will only consider dialectal varieties for its effort on Arabic.
Furthermore, there was a workshop on dialect processing as part of EMNLP 2011.
This tutorial has four different parts: First, we contextualize the question of Arabic
dialects from a sociolinguistic and political perspective. Second, we present a
discussion of issues in relevant to Arabic NLP; this includes generic issues common to
MSA and dialects, and MSA specific issues. In the third part, we detail dialectal
linguistic issues and contrast them to MSA issues. In the last part, we review the state-
of-the-art in Arabic dialect processing covering several enabling technologies and
applications, e.g., dialect identification, speech recognition, morphological processing
(analysis, disambiguation, tokenization, POS tagging), parsing, and machine translation.
Throughout the presentation we will make references to the different resources
available and draw contrastive links with standard Arabic and English. Moreover, we will
discuss annotation standards as exemplified in the Treebank. We will provide links to
recent publications and available toolkits/resources for all four sections.
This tutorial is designed for computer scientists and linguists alike. No knowledge of
Arabic is required (though, we recommend taking a look at Nizar Habash&apos;s Arabic NLP
tutorialhttp://www1.ccls.columbia.edu/~cadim/presentations.html which will be reviewed
as part of the tutorial.)

Mona Diab received her PhD in 2003 in the Linguistics department and UMIACS,
University of Maryland College Park. Her PhD work focused on lexical semantic issues
and was titled Word Sense Disambiguation within a Multilingual Framework. Mona is
currently a research scientist at the Center for Computational Learning Systems,
Columbia University. Her research includes work on word sense disambiguation,
automatic acquisition of natural language resources such as dictionaries and
taxonomies, unsupervised learning methods, lexical semantics, cross language
knowledge induction from both parallel and comparable corpora, Arabic NLP in general,
tools for processing Arabic(s), computational modeling of Arabic dialects, Arabic
syntactic and semantic parsing.
