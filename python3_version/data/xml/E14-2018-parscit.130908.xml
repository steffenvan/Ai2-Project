<bodyText confidence="0.997771">
The paper presents Anaphora – an OS and
language independent tool for clause
annotation and alignment, developed at the
Department of Computational Linguistics,
Institute for Bulgarian Language, Bulgarian
Academy of Sciences. The tool supports
automated sentence splitting and alignment
and modes for manual monolingual annotation
and multilingual alignment of sentences and
clauses. Anaphora has been successfully
applied for the annotation and the alignment of
the Bulgarian-English Sentence- and Clause-
Aligned Corpus (Koeva et al. 2012a) and a
number of other languages including French
and Spanish.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999582">
For years now corpus annotation has played an
essential part in the development of various NLP
technologies. Most of the language resources,
however, do not include clause annotation and
alignment which are considered quite useful in
recent research on Machine Translation (MT)
and parallel text processing (Piperidis et al.,
2000; Sudoh et al., 2010; Ramanathan et al.,
2011).
Aiming to facilitate and improve the process
of clause annotation and alignment of
multilingual texts, we developed Anaphora.
The tool is OS and language independent and
supports automated sentence splitting and
alignment, manual sentence and clause splitting,
validation, correction and alignment, selection
and annotation of conjunctions (including
compounds (MWE)), and identification of the
type of relation between pairs of syntactically
connected clauses.

2 User Interface and Functionalities
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999670625">
Anaphora supports two kinds of operating modes:
a monolingual and a multilingual one.
The monolingual mode is designed for manual
editing and annotation of each part of the parallel
corpus. The window consists of three active
panes (Fig. 1): Text view (top pane), Sentence
view (bottom left-hand pane) and Clause view
and annotation (bottom right-hand pane).

</note>
<bodyText confidence="0.999017714285714">
In this mode the user may chose a file for
verification and post-editing of the automatically
performed sentence alignment. The individual
monolingual texts which are part of an aligned
pair are selected by the file tabs.
The monolingual mode offers the following
functionalities:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.993761777777778">
• sentence splitting;
• clause splitting;
• correction of wrong splitting (merging of
split sentences/clauses);
• annotation of conjunctions;
• selection of compounds;
• identification of the type of relation
between pairs of syntactically connected
clauses.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999741790322581">
The end of a sentence may be changed by
choosing the last word of the sentence and
marking it using the End button from the top
menu. Thus, the selection of the word as a
sentence end is toggled and if it was marked as
an End word, it is no longer such and the
following sentence is automatically merged to
the current one. If the word has not been already
marked as an end, it is thus marked as one and
the sentence is automatically split.
Clicking on any word of a sentence in the Text
view pane results in the sentence appearing in the
Sentence view pane, where clause segmentation
and choice of conjunction are performed. The
user defines the boundaries of clauses by
selecting the words in them. This is achieved by
marking the particular fragment of the text in the
Sentence view pane with the mouse and pressing
the &apos;space&apos; key. This operation toggles the
selection. Thus, a repeated use causes deselection.
Marking a disconnected clause is done by
marking the block of text containing it and
unmarking the unnecessary words. When a
clause is defined, it is listed in the bottom right-
hand pane in a new color following the surface
order of the sentence. Selection of a clause
within another clause is also possible. Then the
inner clause is listed directly after the split clause
while the order of the split clause in the Clause
view pane depends on the position of its first
word in the sentence.
Once the clauses are defined, the user may
annotate the conjunction of two clauses, also
referred to as a marker. The marker may consist
of one or more words or an empty word. Empty
words (w=&amp;quot;====&amp;quot;) are artificial elements
automatically introduced at the beginning of a
potential new clause. An empty word may be
selected as a marker when the conjunction is not
explicit or the clauses are connected by means of
a punctuation mark (for simplicity of annotation
punctuation marks are not identified as
independent tokens but are attached to the
preceding token). When a word or a
compound from one clause is selected in the
Sentence view pane the user chooses another
clause from the Clause view pane to create a pair
of syntactically linked clauses. Then the relation
for the pair is identified by selecting its type with
the grey buttons N_N (coordination), N_S
(subordinated clause following the main clause),
S_N (subordinated clause preceding the main
clause), etc.
The multilingual mode is selected with the
align tab. In this mode annotators can create,
validate and correct the alignment of the parallel
units – sentences and/or clauses.
The window (Fig. 2) has two parallel Text
view panes (on the top) and two parallel List
view panes (in the bottom). Depending on the
chosen menu (Clause or Sentence) the bottom
panes show lists of aligned clauses or sentences.

The multilingual mode uses the output of the
monolingual sentence and clause splitting and
supports the following functionalities:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999506">
• automated sentence alignment;
• manual sentence alignment;
• manual clause alignment.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999178380952381">
Automated sentence alignment is available as
a menu command (Auto Sentence Align) in the
multilingual mode.
Тo switch to manual sentence or clause
alignment the corresponding menu commands
are used – Sentence and Clause.
In the sentence menu the two bottom panes
show lists of aligned sentences, each pair in a
distinct color. The user may correct the
alignment by choosing one or more sentences in
each of the bottom panes and pressing the &apos;space&apos;
button to create a new alignment bead.
In the clause menu, when a sentence is
selected in one of the two Text panes, its clauses
are listed in the respective bottom pane. The
corresponding aligned sentence appears in the
parallel top pane with its clauses listed in the
bottom. Alignment is performed when the user
chooses one or more clauses from each of the
bottom panes and then presses the &apos;space&apos; button.
Thus a new clause alignment bead is created.

3 Applications
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999926071428571">
Anaphora was successfully used for the
annotation and the alignment of the Bulgarian-
English Sentence- and Clause-Aligned Corpus
(Koeva et al. 2012a) which was created as a
training and evaluation data set for automatic
clause alignment in the task of exploring the
effect of clause reordering on the performance of
SMT (Koeva et al., 2012b).
Since its development the tool is continuously
used for annotation and clause alignment of
different parts of the Bulgarian-X language
Parallel Corpus (Koeva et al. 2012c) covering a
number of languages including French and
Spanish.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.996812" genericHeader="method">
4 Implementation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998844">
Anaphora was designed as a self-sufficient
module for annotation and clause alignment
within the multi-functional platform Chooser
(Koeva et al. 2008) which supports various NLP
tasks that involve corpora annotation.
The tool is a stand-alone single user
application implemented in Python and it uses
the standard GUI library tkinter (the Tcl/Tk
python binding) which makes it highly OS
independent.

5 Data Processing and Representation
</sectionHeader>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.88192">
5.1 Input Data
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999516964285714">
The used format is a flat xml with root
element text. The text is a list of word elements
with several attributes like ‘w’ – wordform, ‘l’ –
lemma, ‘u’ – annotator, ‘t’ – timestamp, ‘e’ –
sentence end, etc.
Special attributes are responsible for marking
the compounds (MWE) and clauses. The words
that are members of a compound share a
common value for the attribute ‘p’ (parent).
Similarly, the words in a clause share a common
value for clause – ‘cl’.
This format is compatible with the other
modules of the Chooser platform. Thus, one file
can be annotated with several different types of
annotation like POS, semantic annotation, etc.
The system provides import scripts for two
formats – plain text and the output of the
Bulgarian Language Processing Chain (Koeva
and Genov, 2011) – a TSV/CSV family format,
where the text is tokenized and lemmatized.
Sentence splitting depends on the format of
the input text. If it is a plain text, sentence
splitting is based on the presence of end of
sentence punctuation (full stop, exclamation
mark, and question mark) followed by a capital
letter. When the file is of the TSV/CSV family
format sentence splitting is part of the Language
Processing Chain.

6 Conclusions and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999438">
We believe that, based on its design and
functionalities, Anaphora can be easily used and
it will perform well for any given pair of
languages, that is, it is to a great extent language
independent. The system can also be applied as it
is for phrase segmentation and word and phrase
alignment. However, if we want to include
simultaneous alignment of words, phrases, and
clauses the system needs to be adopted.
We work on including additional functionalities
to facilitate corpora annotation and parallel text
processing such as anaphora annotation.
Our future intentions include also publishing it as
an Open Source code so that it can serve the NLP
community.

Anaphora has been successfully applied for the annotation and the alignment of the Bulgarian-English Sentence- and ClauseAligned Corpus (Koeva et al. 2012a) and a number of other languages including French and Spanish. 1 Introduction For years now corpus annotation has played an essential part in the development of various NLP technologies. Most of the language resources, however, do not include clause annotation and alignment which are considered quite useful in recent research on Machine Translation (MT) and parallel text processing (Piperidis et al., 2000; Sudoh et al., 2010; Ramanathan et al., 2011). Aiming to facilitate and improve the process of clause annotation and alignment of multilingual texts, we developed Anaphora. The tool is OS and language independent and supports automated sentence splitting and alignment, manual sentence and clause splitting, validation, correction and alignment, selection and annotation of conjunctions (including compounds (MWE)), and identification of the type of relation between pairs of syntactically connected clauses. 2 User Interface and Functionalities Anaphora supports two kinds of operating modes: a monolingual and a multi</context>
