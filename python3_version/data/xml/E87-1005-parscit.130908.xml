ABSTRACT
In this paper, we present a morphological pro-
cessor for Modern Greek.
From the linguistic point of view, we try to
elucidate the complexity of the inflectional sy-
stem using a lexical model which follows the
recent work by Lieber, 1980, Selkirk 1982, Kipar-
sky 1982, and others.
The implementation is based on the concept of
&amp;quot;validation grammars&amp;quot; (Courtin 1977).
The morphological processing is controlled by a
finite automaton and it combines
a. a dictionary containing the stems for a
representative fragment of Modern Greek and all
the inflectional affixes with
b. a grammar which carries out the transmis-
sion of the linguistic information needed for the
processing. The words are structured by concate-
nating a stem with an inflectional part. In cer-
tain cases, phonological rules are added to the
grammar in order to capture lexical phonological
phenomena.

Our processor is intended to provide an analy-
sis as well as a generation for every derived item
of the greek lexicon. It covers both inflectional
and derivational morphology but for the time
being only inflection has been treated.
Greek is the only language tested so far.
Nevertheless, we hope that our system is general
enough to be of use to other languages since the
formal and computational aspect of &amp;quot;validation
grammars&amp;quot; and finite automata has already been
used for French (c.f. Courtin et al. 1976, Galio-
tou 1983).
The system is built around the following data
files:
1.A &amp;quot;dictionary&amp;quot; holding morphemes associated to
morpho-syntactic information.
2.A &amp;quot;model&amp;quot; file containing items which act as
reference to every morphematic entry in order to
determine what kind of process the entry under-
goes.
3.A word grammar which governs permissible word
structures. The rules that can apply to an entry
are divided in
a. a &amp;quot;basic initial rule&amp;quot; acting as a recogni-
tion process.
b. The validation rules that determine all
possible combinations of the entry with other
morphemes.
4. A list of phonemes described as sets of featu-
res. The same file contains also a set of phonolo-
gical rules generating lexical phonological phe-
nomena. These rules govern permissible correspon-
dences between the form of entries listed in the
dictionary and the form they develop when they
are combined in sequences of morphemes.
These files are used both for analysis and ge-
neration. The process of the present morphological
analysis consists of parsing an input of inflected
words with respect to the word grammar. Stems
associated to the appropriate morpho-syntactic in-
formation will be the output of the parsing.
The process of generation of a given inflected
word consists of
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.78887725">
a. determining its stem by a morphological
analysis.
b. Generating all or a subset of the permis-
sible word forms.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9988482">
For the needs of this presentation, lexical
items have been transcribed in a semi-phonological
manner. According to this transcription,all greek
vowels written as double character are kept as
such:

(1) Graphemes Phonemes
CL. 4. ei
OL 0
aL + ai e
ou oy _
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.997832">
Moreover, the sounds [il and [o] written in Greek
as n and w respectively are transcribed as i:
and o:. The transcription of the last two vowels
reminds of their ancient greek status as long
vowels.
As far as accent is concerned, we decided to
exclude this aspect from the present form of the
processor. Accentuation in Greek is a linguistic
problem which has not been solved as yet. We are
working on this matter and we hope to implement
accent in the near future.
The morphological processing is controlled by
a finite automaton&apos; with the help of the dictio-

nary and the word grammar which controls word for-
mation and carries out the transmission of the
linguistic information needed for the processing.
In certain cases, the grammar makes use of phono-
logical rules in order to capture lexical phonolo-
gical phenomena such as insertion, deletion and
change.
The processor is implemented in TURBO-PROLOG.
(version 1.0) running under MS-DOS (version 3.10)
on an IBM-XT with 640 kB main memory. It consists
of an analysis and a generation sub-module.

2. Linguistic assumptions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9686585">
The theoretical framework underlying the
linguistic aspects of the project is that of Gene-
rative Morphology, in particular the recent work
by Lieber 1980, Selkirk 1982, Kiparsky 1982 and
others.
In developing our system, we have adopted the
proposals made in Ralli&apos;s study on Greek Morpholo-
gy (Ph.D.diss., 1987). Therefore, we assume that
the greek lexicon contains a list of entries
(dictionary) and a grammar which combines morpholo-
gy with phonology. The dictionary is morpheme
based. It contains stems and affixes which are
associated with the following information fields.
a. The string in its basic phonological form.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999401818181818">
b. Reference to possible allomorphic varia-
tions of the string which are not productively ge-
nerated by rule.
c. Specifications of grammatical category and
other morpho-syntactic features that characterize
the particular entries.
d. The meaning.
e. Diacritic marks which are integers permit-
ting the correct mapping between the stem and the
affix where this cannot be done by rule.
(1) Stem Affix

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.952508909090909">
In our work, diacritic marks replace the tradition-.
al use of declensions and conjugations which fail
to divide nouns and verbs in inflectional classes.
The inflectional structure of words is handled
by a grammar which assigns a binary tree structure
to the words in question. The rules are of the form
(2) Word 9. stem Infl,
where, Word and stem are lexical categories and
Infl indicates the inflectional ending. For nomi-
nal stems, Infl corresponds to a single affix
marked for number and case.

For verbs, the constituent Infl refers either
to one or to two affixes. In the latter case, two
affixes belong to the endings of verbal types that
are aspectually marked.

Note that the stem yrap is listed in the dictiona-
ry as yraf. The consonant [f] is changed to E
because of the Es] that follows. The phonological
rule in Question is lexical and it applies to the
morpheme boundary. As such, the rule is morpholo-
gically conditioned and it allows exceptions:
When verbal types do not contain an aspectual
marker, Infl refers to a single affix.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998155">
3.1 The dictionary structure
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.989827310344828">
In our system, the dictionary consists of a se-
quence of entries each in the form of a Prolog
term.
It has to be noted that no significant semantic
information is present in our entries because that
field is still unexploited. Similarly, the syntac-
tic information concerning subcategorization pro-
perties of lexical entries is not taken into
account.
The dictionary also contains information that
permits the &amp;quot;linking&amp;quot; with the grammar. So, apart
from the linguistic information mentioned in
section 2, every entry of the dictionary contains
also
a. a list of rules that permit the use of a
particular entry (rules that have the entry as
their terminal symbol).
b. a list of validation. rules (rules that can
be applied after each use of that entry).
As far as morphology is concerned, forms can be
arranged into classes. We choose arbitrarily an
element of this class called a &amp;quot;model&amp;quot; and every
stem in the dictionary refers to a model. Morpho-
logical information is found at the model level.
In this way, the size of the dictionary is signi-
ficantly reduced.
The model file consists also of sequences of
entries, each in the form of a Prolog term. Each
model includes information concerning
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.918902857142857">
a. the form of the string,
b. the &amp;quot;basic initial rule&amp;quot; which identifies
the string,
c. the possible diacritic mark,
d. the set of morpho-syntactic features,
e. the validation rules which substitute word
formation rules.

We did not write separate dictionary entries for
affixes because each affix is a model on its own.
Therefore, information associated with an affix
model must cover all unpredictable information
listed within the corresponding dictionary entry.
Instead of a &amp;quot;basic initial rule&amp;quot;, every affix mo-
del refers to a set of rules that govern the com-
bination of the affix with a particular stem. An
affix that terminates a word is identified by an
empty set of validation rules.

4. The grammar
In order to carry out the processing we use a
&amp;quot;validation grammar&amp;quot; as defined in Courtin 1977.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999302">
4.1 Review of validation grammars
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.924260045454545">
A validation grammar GV is a 4-tuple
GV=(VTV&apos; SV&apos; E)&apos; where,
VTV = a vocabulary of terminal symbols.
E=a subset of the set of integers.
SV G (S4E) and is called axiom

Property 1
A validation grammar is equivalent to areaular
grammar since they generate the same language.
Consequently, there is a finite automaton that re-
cognizes the strings generated by a validation
grammar.
Property 2
The number of production rules of a validation
grammar is less than or equal to the number of
production rules of its equivalent regular grammar.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.846431">
4.2 Control, transmission and phonological changes
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9982238">
Control is carried out with the help of valida-
tions which are redefined after the application of
each rule. In our system, validation rules consist
of a list of Prolog clauses.
Transmission concerns the grammatical category
and other morpho-syntactic features.
Linguistically, we regard stems to be the head
of inflected words. As such, they contribute to
the categorial specifications of the words. More-
over, all morpho-syntactic features of inflectio-
nal affixes are also copied to the word. In word
structures built in the form of a tree, features
are percolated to the mother node according to the
Percolation Principle as it was formulated by
Selkirk.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.653104">
(1) Percolation Principle (Selkirk 1982)
a. If a head has a feature specification [aFi],
aAu, its mother node must be specified [aFil and
vice versa.
b. If a non head has a feature specification
Bfj and the head has the feature specification
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.941487558823529">
[
uFj], then the mother node must have the feature
specification [6Fj]. (page 76).
The principle in question is incorporated in
our validation rules where, for each inflected
word, it is determined which features are taken
from the stem and which come from the affix.
(2) Example of a validation rule
rule(n11,Stem,_,StFeat,_,
Affix, [J
Result, ],ResFeat,AfVal):-
concat(Stem,Affix,Result),
append_list(StFeat,AfFeat,ResFeat)
where, &amp;quot;concat&amp;quot; is a Prolog predicate performing
the concatenation of two strings and &amp;quot;append list&amp;quot;
is a Prolog predicate performing the concatenat-
ion of two lists.
However, according to Ralli&apos;s study, features
are not only percolated to words from stems and
affixes. Feature values may also be inserted to
certain underspecified environments. For instance,
when an inflected word fails to take certain fea-
tures from both the stem and the ending, the rule
then takes over the role of adding them. Consider
the verbal form yrafo: &amp;quot;I write&amp;quot;. It takes the ca-
tegory value from the stem (yraf-) and the featu-
res of person and number from the affix (-o:). It
is clear that at this point, yrafo: is underspeci-
fied because besides the values of person and num-
ber, greek verbal forms must be characterized by
aspect, tense and voice. Following this, we assume
that specific values of the last three attributes
are inserted by the rule governing the combination
of the stem yraf- with the ending -o:.

It is worth noting that a validation rule can

logical phenomena.

4.2.1 Morpho-phonological insertion
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9986733">
In Greek, in several cases, transition elements
appear at a morpheme boundary between two consti-
tuents (c.f.Ralli 1987). Both the insertion and the
phonological form of the elements are always con-
ditioned by the morphological environment.
Nominal as well as verbal inflection undergo
morpho-phonological insertion depending on the
kind of stem that is involved in the process. An
example of morpho-phonological insertion is the
verbal thematic vowel.

vowel appears in singular, between the stem and
the inflection.

phenomenon.

<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.625515">
4.2.2 Morpho-phonological change
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999985875">
As already mentioned in section 2, verbal in-
flection undergoes morphophonological changes on
the stem and/or the affix during the construction
of aspectually marked verbal types. Rules perfor-
ming phonological changes are applied cyclically
each time the appropriate lexical string is formed.
Phonological rules take into account a list of
phonemes described as sets of distinctive features.
In our system, phonemes are listed as Prolog terms.
Phonological rules are listed as Prolog clauses.
Take for example the form be-s-ame &amp;quot;we tied&amp;quot;.
The stem be- is listed in the dictionary as 6en-.
The validation rule authorizing the concatenation
of ben- and -s- demands the application of a lexi-
cal phonological rule responsible for the deletion
of the final Ink
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.912963">
4.2.3 The augment rule
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98541845">
It is generally accepted that augment in Modern
Greek must be considered as a phonological element
introduced in the appropriate morphological envi-
ronment. That is, an e- is prefixed to forms marked
for past in which it is always accentuated. Given
the fact that accentuation is not treated here, we
decided to divide verbal stems in marked and un-
marked for augment. Once a verbal item is built,
the e- is added at the beginning of the form in
singular and third person plural only if the stem
carries the feature [aug2.
In our system, the augment rule, listed also as
a Prolog clause, is activated by validation rules
authorizing the concatenation of a verbal stem and
a verbal affix marked for past. The same rules
insert the feature value &amp;quot;active&amp;quot;.
In this way, we obtain:
(1) e-yraf-a &amp;quot;I was writing&amp;quot;
yraf-ame &amp;quot;We were writing&amp;quot;
but not *e-yraf-ame

The analysis of a word form is carried out in-
dependently of its syntactic environment. Conse-
quently, the analyzer will provide the set of all

In order to program and store the automaton,we
perform a splitting of its transitions and each
transition is represented by a rule.

The rule mit starts the analysis by taking

stem &amp;quot;avl&amp;quot; is validated by rules n21 and n23,
among others, which will also authorize the use
of a 0-affix. Moreover, they perform morpho-pho-
nological insertion of the transition element -i:
during the concatenation of &amp;quot;avl&amp;quot; and &amp;quot; &amp;quot;. The
resulting string is avli: in both cases. These
rules also perform feature insertions. Rule n21
[1
inserts feature values 5nominative and [singular]
while n23 inserts feature values [accusative] and
[singularl.
The analysis of the form avli: is completed in
27 hundredths of a second (cpu time).

In order to generate all possible forms of avli:

In this paper, a morphological processor has
been presented that is capable of handling lexical

Therefore, information associated with an affix model must cover all unpredictable information listed within the corresponding dictionary entry.

Both the insertion and the phonological form of the elements are always conditioned by the morphological environment. Nominal as well as verbal inflection undergo morpho-phonological insertion depending on the kind of stem that is involved in the process. An example of morpho-phonological insertion is the verbal thematic vowel. (1) Stem Th.V.

Transmission concerns the grammatical category and other morpho-syntactic features. Linguistically, we regard stems to be the head of inflected words. As such, they contribute to the categorial specifications of the words. Moreover, all morpho-syntactic features of inflectional affixes are also copied to the word. In word structures built in the form of a tree, features are percolated to the mother node according to the Percolation Principle as it was formulated by Selkirk. (1) Percolation Principle (Selkirk 1982) a. If a head has a feature specification [aFi], aAu, its mother node must be specified [aFil and vice versa. b. If a non head has a feature specification Bfj and the head has the feature specification [ uFj], then the mother node must have the feature specification [6Fj]. (page 76). The principle in question is incorporated in our validation rules where, for each inflected word, it is determined which features are taken from the stem and which come from the affix.
