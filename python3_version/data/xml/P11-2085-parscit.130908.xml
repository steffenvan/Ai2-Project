Chinese Pinyin input method is very impor-
tant for Chinese language information pro-
cessing. Users may make errors when they
are typing in Chinese words. In this paper, we
are concerned with the reasons that cause the
errors. Inspired by the observation that press-
ing backspace is one of the most common us-
er behaviors to modify the errors, we collect
54, 309, 334 error-correction pairs from a real-
world data set that contains 2, 277,786 user-
s via backspace operations. In addition, we
present a comparative analysis of the data to
achieve a better understanding of users’ input
behaviors. Comparisons with English typos
suggest that some language-specific properties
result in a part of Chinese input errors.

Unlike western languages, Chinese is unique due
to its logographic writing system. Chinese users
cannot directly type in Chinese words using a QW-
ERTY keyboard. Pinyin is the official system to
transcribe Chinese characters into the Latin alpha-
bet. Based on this transcription system, Pinyin input
methods have been proposed to assist users to type
in Chinese words (Chen, 1997).
The typical way to type in Chinese words is
in a sequential manner (Wang et al., 2001). As-
sume users want to type in the Chinese word “什
么(what)”. First, they mentally generate and type
in corresponding Pinyin “shenme”. Then, a Chinese
Pinyin input method displays a list of Chinese words
which share that Pinyin, as shown in Fig. 1. Users

visually search the target word from candidates and
select numeric key “1” to get the result. The last t-
wo steps do not exist in typing process of English
words, which indicates that it is more complicated
for Chinese users to type in Chinese words.
Chinese users may make errors when they are typ-
ing in Chinese words. As shown in Fig. 2, a user
may mistype “shenme” as “shenem”. Typical Chi-
nese Pinyin input method can not return the right
word. Users may not realize that an error occurs and
select the first candidate word “什恶魔” (a mean-
ingless word) as the result. This greatly limits us-
er experience since users have to identify errors and
modify them, or cannot get the right word.
In this paper, we analyze the reasons that cause
errors in Chinese Pinyin input method. This analy-
sis is helpful in enhancing the user experience and
the performance of Chinese Pinyin input method. In
practice, users press backspace on the keyboard to
modify the errors, they delete the mistyped word and
re-type in the correct word. Motivated by this ob-

servation, we can extract error-correction pairs from
backspace operations. These error-correction pairs
are of great importance in Chinese spelling correc-
tion task which generally relies on sets of confusing
words.
We extract 54, 309, 334 error-correction pairs
from user input behaviors and further study them.
Our comparative analysis of Chinese and English ty-
pos suggests that some language-specific properties
of Chinese lead to a part of input errors. To the best
of our knowledge, this paper is the first one which
analyzes user input behaviors in Chinese Pinyin in-
put method.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
Section 2 discusses related works. Section 3 intro-
duces how we collect errors in Chinese Pinyin input
method. In Section 4, we investigate the reasons that
result in these errors. Section 5 concludes the whole
paper and discusses future work.

For English spelling correction (Kukich, 1992;
Ahmad and Kondrak, 2005; Chen et al., 2007;
Whitelaw et al., 2009; Gao et al., 2010), most ap-
proaches make use of a lexicon which contains a list
of well-spelled words (Hirst and Budanitsky, 2005;
Islam and Inkpen, 2009). Context features (Ro-
zovskaya and Roth, 2010) of words provide useful
evidences for spelling correction. These features
are usually represented by an n-gram language mod-
el (Cucerzan and Brill, 2004; Wilcox-O’Hearn et
al., 2010). Phonetic features (Toutanova and Moore,
2002; Atkinson, 2008) are proved to be useful in En-
glish spelling correction. A spelling correction sys-
tem is trained using these features by a noisy channel
model (Kernighan et al., 1990; Ristad et al., 1998;
Brill and Moore, 2000).
Chang (1994) first proposes a representative ap-
proach for Chinese spelling correction, which re-
lies on sets of confusing characters. Zhang et al.
(2000) propose an approximate word-matching al-
gorithm for Chinese to solve Chinese spell detec-
tion and correction task. Zhang et al. (1999) present
a winnow-based approach for Chinese spelling cor-
rection which takes both local language features and
wide-scope semantic features into account. Lin and
Yu (2004) use Chinese frequent strings and report
an accuracy of 87.32%. Liu et al. (2009) show that
about 80% of the errors are related to pronunciation-
s. Visual and phonological features are used in Chi-
nese spelling correction (Liu et al., 2010).
Instead of proposing a method for spelling cor-
rection, we mainly investigate the reasons that cause
typing errors in both English and Chinese. Some
errors are caused by specific properties in Chinese
such as the phonetic difference between Mandarin
and dialects spoken in southern China. Meanwhile,
confusion sets of Chinese words play an importan-
t role in Chinese spelling correction. We extract a
large scale of error-correction pairs from real user
input behaviors. These pairs contain important ev-
idence about confusing Pinyins and Chinese words
which are helpful in Chinese spelling correction.

We analyze user input behaviors from anonymous
user typing records in a Chinese input method. Data
set used in this paper is extracted from Sogou Chi-
nese Pinyin input method&apos;. It contains 2,277,786
users’ typing records in 15 days. The numbers of
Chinese words and characters are 3, 042, 637, 537
and 5, 083, 231, 392, respectively. We show some

From Fig. 3, we can see the typing process of a
Chinese sentence “it- )Z ffG,” (What is this). Each
line represents an input segment or a backspace op-
eration. For example, word “ffG,” (what) is type-
d in using Pinyin “shenme” with numeric selection
“1” at 11:10am in Microsoft Word application.
The user made a mistake to type in the third
Pinyin (“shenme” is mistyped as “shenem”). Then,
he/she pressed the backspace to modify the errors
he has made. the word “ff-Mu ” is deleted and re-
placed with the correct word “ffG,” using Pinyin

“shenme”. As a result, we compare the typed-
in Pinyins before and after backspace operations.
We can find the Pinyin-correction pairs “shenem-
shenme”, since their edit distance is less than a
threshold. Threshold is set to 2 in this paper, as
Damerau (1964) shows that about 80% of typos are
caused by a single edit operation. Therefore, using a
threshold of 2, we should be able to find most of the
typos. Furthermore, we can extract corresponding
Chinese word-correction pairs “f&apos;ME-�-ff6,” from
this typing record.
Using heuristic rules discussed above, we extrac-
t 54, 309, 334 Pinyin-correction and Chinese word-
correction pairs. We list some examples of extracted
Pinyin-correction and Chinese word-correction pairs
in Table 1. Most of the mistyped Chinese words are
meaningless.

We want to evaluate the precision and recall of
our extraction method. For precision aspect, we ran-
domly select 1, 000 pairs and ask five native speak-
ers to annotate them as correct or wrong. Annota-
tion results show that the precision of our method is
about 75.8%. Some correct Pinyins are labeled as
errors because we only take edit distance into con-
sideration. We should consider context features as
well, which will be left as our future work.
We choose 15 typical mistyped Pinyins to evalu-
ate the recall of our method. The total occurrences
of these mistyped Pinyins are 259, 051. We success-
fully retrieve 144,020 of them, which indicates the
recall of our method is about 55.6%. Some errors
are not found because sometimes users do not modi-
fy the errors, especially when they are using Chinese
input method under instant messenger softwares.

4 Comparisons of Pinyin typos and
English Typos
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999012625">
In this section, we compare the Pinyin typos and En-
glish typos. As shown in (Cooper, 1983), typing er-
rors can be classified into four categories: deletions,
insertions, substitutions, and transpositions. We aim
at studying the reasons that result in these four kinds
of typing errors in Chinese Pinyin and English, re-
spectively.
For English typos, we generate mistyped word-
correction pairs from Wikipedia2 and SpellGood.3,
which contain 4,206 and 10, 084 common mis-
spellings in English, respectively. As shown in Ta-
ble 2, we reach the first conclusion: about half
of the typing errors in Pinyin and English are
caused by deletions, which indicates that users are
more possible to omit some letters than other three
edit operations.

We can see from Table 3 and Table 4 that: (1)
vowels (a, o, e, i, u) are deleted or inserted more fre-
quently than consonants in Pinyin. (2) some specific
properties in Chinese lead to insertion and deletion
errors. Many users in southern China cannot dis-
tinguish the front and the back nasal sound (‘ang’ -
‘an’, ‘ing’ - ‘in’, ‘eng’ - ‘en’) as well as the retroflex
and the blade-alveolar (‘zh’ - ‘z’, ‘sh’ - ‘s’, ‘ch’ -
‘c’). They are confused about whether they should
add letter ‘g’ or ‘h’ under these situations. (3) the
same letters can occur continuously in English, such
as “acomplish-accomplish” and “admited-admitted”
in our examples. English users sometimes make in-
sertion or deletion errors in these cases. We also
observe this kind of errors in Chinese Pinyin, such
as “yingai-yinggai”, “liange-liangge” and “dianao-
diannao”.
For transposition errors, Table 5 lists Top 10 pat-
terns that produce transposition errors in Pinyin and
English. Our running example “shenem-shenme”
belongs to this kind of errors. We classify the let-
ters of the keyboard into two categories, i.e. “left”
and “right”, according to their positions on the key-
board. Letter ‘e’ is controlled by left hand while ‘m’
is controlled by right hand. Users mistype “shenme”
as “shenem” because they mistake the typing order
of ‘m’ and ‘e’.
Fig. 4 is a graphic representation, in which we add
a link between ‘m’ and ‘e’. The rest patterns in Ta-
ble 5 can be done in the same manner. Interestingly,
from Fig. 4, we reach the second conclusion: most
of the transposition errors are caused by mistak-
ing the typing orders across left and right hands.
For instance, users intend to type in a letter (‘m’)
controlled by right hand. But they type in a letter
(‘e’) controlled by left hand instead.

For substitution errors, we study the reason why
users mistype one letter for another. In the Pinyin-
correction pairs, users always mistype ‘a’ as ‘e’ and
vice versa. The reason is that they have similar pro-
nunciations in Chinese. As a result, we add two di-
rected edges ‘a’ and ‘e’ in Fig. 5. Some letters are
mistyped for each other because they are adjacent
on the keyboard although they do not share similar
pronunciations, such as ‘g’ and ‘f’.
We summarize the substitution errors in English
in Fig. 6. Letters ‘q’, ‘k’ and ‘c’ are often mixed up
with each other because they sound alike in English
although they are apart on the keyboard. However,
the three letters are not connected in Fig. 5, which
indicates that users can easily distinguish them in
Pinyin.

Table 6: Pronunciation properties and keyboard dis-
tance in Chinese Pinyin and English
We list some examples in Table 6. For example,
letters ‘m’ and ‘n’ have similar pronunciations in
both Chinese and English. Moreover, they are adja-
cent on the keyboard, which leads to interferences or
confusion in both Chinese and English. Letters ‘j’,
‘q’ and ‘x’ are far from each other on the keyboard.
But they sound alike in Chinese, which makes them
connected in Fig. 5. In Fig. 6, letters ‘b’ and ‘p’
are connected to each other because they have simi-
lar pronunciations in English, although they are not
adjacent on the keyboard.
Finally, we summarize the third conclusion: sub-
stitution errors are caused by language specific
similarities (similar pronunciations) or keyboard
neighborhood (adjacent on the keyboard).
All in all, we generally classify typing errors in
English and Chinese into four categories and investi-
gate the reasons that result in these errors respective-
ly. Some language specific properties, such as pro-
nunciations in English and Chinese, lead to substitu-
tion, insertion and deletion errors. Keyboard layouts
play an important role in transposition errors, which
are language-independent.

5 Conclusions and Future Works
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999982416666667">
In this paper, we study user input behaviors in Chi-
nese Pinyin input method from backspace opera-
tions. We aim at analyzing the reasons that cause
these errors. Users signal that they are very likely
to make errors if they press backspace on the key-
board. Then they modify the errors and type in the
correct words they want. Different from the previous
research, we extract abundant Pinyin-correction and
Chinese word-correction pairs from backspace op-
erations. Compared with English typos, we observe
some language-specific properties in Chinese have
impact on errors. All in all, user behaviors (Zheng
et al., 2009; Zheng et al., 2010; Zheng et al., 2011b)
in Chinese Pinyin input method provide novel per-
spectives for natural language processing tasks.
Below we sketch three possible directions for the
future work: (1) we should consider position fea-
tures in analyzing Pinyin errors. For example, it is
less likely that users make errors in the first letter
of an input Pinyin. (2) we aim at designing a self-
adaptive input method that provide error-tolerant
features (Chen and Lee, 2000; Zheng et al., 2011a).
(3) we want to build a Chinese spelling correction
system based on extracted error-correction pairs.

<abstract confidence="0.999371882352941">Chinese Pinyin input method is very important for Chinese language information processing. Users may make errors when they are typing in Chinese words. In this paper, we are concerned with the reasons that cause the errors. Inspired by the observation that pressing backspace is one of the most common user behaviors to modify the errors, we collect pairs from a realdata set that contains users via backspace operations. In addition, we present a comparative analysis of the data to achieve a better understanding of users’ input behaviors. Comparisons with English typos suggest that some language-specific properties result in a part of Chinese input errors.</abstract>

Comparisons with English typos suggest that some language-specific properties result in a part of Chinese input errors. 1 Introduction Unlike western languages, Chinese is unique due to its logographic writing system. Chinese users cannot directly type in Chinese words using a QWERTY keyboard. Pinyin is the official system to transcribe Chinese characters into the Latin alphabet. Based on this transcription system, Pinyin input methods have been proposed to assist users to type in Chinese words (Chen, 1997). The typical way to type in Chinese words is in a sequential manner (Wang et al., 2001). Assume users want to type in the Chinese word “什 么(what)”. First, they mentally generate and type in corresponding Pinyin “shenme”. Then, a Chinese Pinyin input method displays a list of Chinese words which share that Pinyin, as shown in Fig. 1. Users Figure 1: Typical Chinese Pinyin input method for a correct Pinyin (Sogou-Pinyin).

We choose 15 typical mistyped Pinyins to evaluate the recall of our method. The total occurrences of these mistyped Pinyins are 259, 051. We successfully retrieve 144,020 of them, which indicates the recall of our method is about 55.6%. Some errors are not found because sometimes users do not modify the errors, especially when they are using Chinese input method under instant messenger softwares. 4 Comparisons of Pinyin typos and English Typos In this section, we compare the Pinyin typos and English typos. As shown in (Cooper, 1983), typing errors can be classified into four categories: deletions, insertions, substitutions, and transpositions. We aim at studying the reasons that result in these four kinds of typing errors in Chinese Pinyin and English, respectively. For English typos, we generate mistyped wordcorrection pairs from Wikipedia2 and SpellGood.3, which contain 4,206 and 10, 084 common misspellings in English, respectively. As shown in Table 2, we reach the first conclusion: about half of the typing errors in Pinyin and English are caused by deletions, which indicates that users are more possible to omit some </context>

As a result, we compare the typedin Pinyins before and after backspace operations. We can find the Pinyin-correction pairs “shenemshenme”, since their edit distance is less than a threshold. Threshold is set to 2 in this paper, as Damerau (1964) shows that about 80% of typos are caused by a single edit operation. Therefore, using a threshold of 2, we should be able to find most of the typos. Furthermore, we can extract corresponding Chinese word-correction pairs “f&apos;ME-�-ff6,” from this typing record. Using heuristic rules discussed above, we extract 54, 309, 334 Pinyin-correction and Chinese wordcorrection pairs. We list some examples of extracted Pinyin-correction and Chinese word-correction pairs in Table 1. Most of the mistyped Chinese words are meaningless.

Comparisons with English typos suggest that some language-specific properties result in a part of Chinese input errors. 1 Introduction Unlike western languages, Chinese is unique due to its logographic writing system. Chinese users cannot directly type in Chinese words using a QWERTY keyboard. Pinyin is the official system to transcribe Chinese characters into the Latin alphabet. Based on this transcription system, Pinyin input methods have been proposed to assist users to type in Chinese words (Chen, 1997). The typical way to type in Chinese words is in a sequential manner (Wang et al., 2001). Assume users want to type in the Chinese word “什 么(what)”. First, they mentally generate and type in corresponding Pinyin “shenme”. Then, a Chinese Pinyin input method displays a list of Chinese words which share that Pinyin, as shown in Fig. 1. Users Figure 1: Typical Chinese Pinyin input method for a correct Pinyin (Sogou-Pinyin). Figure 2: Typical Chinese Pinyin input method for a mistyped Pinyin (Sogou-Pinyin). visually search the target word from candidates and select numeric key “1” to get the result. The last two steps do not exist in typing process of English words, which indicates t</context>

We aim at analyzing the reasons that cause these errors. Users signal that they are very likely to make errors if they press backspace on the keyboard. Then they modify the errors and type in the correct words they want. Different from the previous research, we extract abundant Pinyin-correction and Chinese word-correction pairs from backspace operations. Compared with English typos, we observe some language-specific properties in Chinese have impact on errors. All in all, user behaviors (Zheng et al., 2009; Zheng et al., 2010; Zheng et al., 2011b) in Chinese Pinyin input method provide novel perspectives for natural language processing tasks. Below we sketch three possible directions for the future work: (1) we should consider position features in analyzing Pinyin errors. For example, it is less likely that users make errors in the first letter of an input Pinyin. (2) we aim at designing a selfadaptive input method that provide error-tolerant features (Chen and Lee, 2000; Zheng et al., 2011a).

For example, it is less likely that users make errors in the first letter of an input Pinyin. (2) we aim at designing a selfadaptive input method that provide error-tolerant features (Chen and Lee, 2000; Zheng et al., 2011a). (3) we want to build a Chinese spelling correction system based on extracted error-correction pairs. Acknowledgments This </context>

We aim at analyzing the reasons that cause these errors. Users signal that they are very likely to make errors if they press backspace on the keyboard. Then they modify the errors and type in the correct words they want. Different from the previous research, we extract abundant Pinyin-correction and Chinese word-correction pairs from backspace operations. Compared with English typos, we observe some language-specific properties in Chinese have impact on errors.
