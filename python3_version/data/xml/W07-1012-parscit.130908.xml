<bodyText confidence="0.999742375">
The vast number of published medical doc-
uments is considered a vital source for rela-
tionship discovery. This paper presents a sta-
tistical unsupervised system, called BioNoc-
ulars, for extracting protein-protein interac-
tions from biomedical text. BioNoculars
uses graph-based mutual reinforcement to
make use of redundancy in data to construct
extraction patterns in a domain independent
fashion. The system was tested using MED-
LINE abstract for which the protein-protein
interactions that they contain are listed in the
database of interacting proteins and protein-
protein interactions (DIPPPI). The system
reports an F-Measure of 0.55 on test MED-
LINE abstracts.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999920325581395">
With the ever-increasing number of published
biomedical research articles and the dependency
of new research and previously published research,
medical researchers and practitioners are faced with
the daunting prospect of reading through hundreds
or possibly thousands of research articles to sur-
vey advances in areas of interest. Much work has
been done to ease access and discovery of articles
that match the interest of researchers via the use
of search engines such as PubMed, which provides
search capabilities over MEDLINE, a collection of
more than 15 million journal paper abstracts main-
tained by the National Library of Medicine (NLM).
However, with the addition of abstracts from more
than 5,000 medical journals to MEDLINE every
year, the number of articles containing information
that is pertinent to users needs has grown consider-
ably. These 5,000 journals constitute only a subset
of the published biomedical research. Further, med-
ical articles often contain redundant information and
only subsections of articles are typically of direct in-
terest to researchers. More advanced information
extraction tools have been developed to effectively
distill medical articles to produce key pieces of in-
formation from articles while attempting to elimi-
nate redundancy. These tools have focused on areas
such as protein-protein interaction, gene-disease re-
lationship, and chemical-protein interaction (Chun
et al., 2006). Many of these tools have been used
to extract key pieces of information from MED-
LINE. Most of the reported information extraction
approaches use sets of handcrafted rules in conjunc-
tion with manually curated dictionaries and ontolo-
gies.
This paper presents a fully unsupervised statisti-
cal technique to discover protein-protein interaction
based on automatically discoverable repeating pat-
terns in text that describe relationships. The paper
is organized as follows: section 2 surveys related
work; section 3 describes BioNoculars; Section 4
describes the employed experimental setup; section
5 reports and comments on experimental results; and
section 6 concludes the paper.

2.1 BNE Tagging
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999431688172044">
Concerning BNE tagging, the most common ap-
proaches are based on hand-crafted rules, statisti-
cal classifiers, or a hybrid of both (usually in con-
junction with dictionaries of BNE). Rule-based sys-
tems (Fukuda et al., 1998; Hanisch et al., 2003; Ya-
mamoto et al., 2003) that use dictionaries tend to
exhibit high precision in tagging named entities but
generally with lower tagging recall. They tend to
lag the latest published research and are sensitive
to the expression of the named entities. Dictionar-
ies of BNE are typically laborious and expensive to
build, and they are dependant on nomenclatures and
specific species. Statistical approaches (Collier et
al., 2000; Kazama et al., 2002; Settles, 2004) typ-
ically improve recall at the expense of precision,
but are more readily retargetable for new nomen-
clatures and organisms. Hybrid systems (Tanabe
and Wilbur, 2002; Mika and Rost, 2004) attempt to
take advantage of both approaches. Although these
approaches tend to generate acceptable recognition,
they are heavily dependent on the type of data on
which they are trained.
(Fukuda et al., 1998) proposed a rule-based pro-
tein name extraction system called PROPER (PRO-
tein Proper-noun phrase Extracting Rules) system,
which utilizes a set of rules based on the surface
form of text in conjunction with a Part-Of-Speech
(POS) tagging to identify what looks like a protein
without referring to any specific BNE dictionary.
They reported a 94.7% precision and a 98.84% re-
call for the identification of BNEs. The results that
they achieved seem to be too specific to their train-
ing and test sets.
(Hanisch et al., 2003) proposed a rule-based
protein and gene name extraction system called
ProMiner, which is based on the construction of a
general-purpose dictionary along with different dic-
tionaries of synonyms and an automatic curation
procedure based on a simple token model of protein
names. Results showed that their system achieved a
0.80 F-measure score in the name extraction task on
the BioCreative test set (BioCreative).
(Yamamoto et al., 2003) proposed the use of mor-
phological analysis to improve protein name tag-
ging. Their approach tags proteins based on mor-
pheme chunking to properly determine protein name
boundary. They used the GENIA corpus for training
and testing and obtained an F-measure score of 0.70
for protein name tagging.
(Collier et al., 2000) used a machine learning ap-
proach to protein name extraction based on a linear
interpolation Hidden Markov Model (HMM) trained
using bi-grams. They focused on finding the most
likely protein sequence classes (C) for a given se-
quence of words (W), by maximizing the probabil-
ity of C given W, P(C—W). Unlike traditional dic-
tionary based methods, the approach uses no manu-
ally crafted patterns. However, their approach may
misidentify term boundaries for phrases containing
potentially ambiguous local structures such as co-
ordination and parenthesis. They reported an F-
measure score of 0.73 for different mixtures of mod-
els tested on 20 abstracts.
(Kazama et al., 2002) proposed a machine learn-
ing approach to BNE tagging based on support vec-
tor machines (SVM), which was trained on the GE-
NIA corpus. Their preliminary results of the system
showed that the SVM with the polynomial kernel
function outperforms techniques of Maximum En-
tropy based systems.
Yet another BNE tagging system is ABNER (Set-
tles, 2005), which utilizes machine learning, namely
conditional random fields, with a variation of or-
thographic and contextual features and no seman-
tic or syntactic features. ABNER achieves an F-
measure score of 0.71 on the NLPA 2004 shared
task dataset corpus and 0.70 on the BioCreative cor-
pus.and scored an F1-measure of 51.8set.
(Tanabe and Wilbur, 2002) used a combination
of statistical and knowledge-based strategies, which
utilized automatically generated rules from transfor-
mation based POS tagging and other generated rules
from morphological clues, low frequency trigrams,
and indicator terms. A key step in their method is
the extraction of multi-word gene and protein names
that are dominant in the corpus but inaccessible to
the POS tagger. The advantage of such an approach
is that it is independent of any biomedical domain.
However, it can miss single word gene names that
do not occur in contextual gene theme terms. It
can also incorrectly tag compound gene names, plas-
mids, and phages.
(Mika and Rost, 2004) developed NLProt, which
</bodyText>

combines the use of dictionaries, rules-based filter-
ing, and machine learning based on an SVM classi-
fier to tag protein names in MEDLINE. The NLProt
system used rules for pre-filtering and the SVM for
classification, and it achieved a precision of 75% and
recall 76%.

2.2 Relationship Extraction
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999888204545455">
As for the extraction of interactions, most efforts in
extraction of biomedical interactions between enti-
ties from text have focused on using rule-based ap-
proaches due to the familiarity of medical terms that
tend to describe interactions. These approaches have
proven to be successful with notably good results. In
these approaches, most researchers attempted to de-
fine an accurate set of rules to describe relationship
types and patterns and to build ontologies and dic-
tionaries to be consulted in the extraction process.
These rules, ontologies, and dictionaries are typi-
cally domain specific and are often not generalizable
to other problems.
(Blaschke et al., 1999) reported a domain spe-
cific approach for extracting protein-protein interac-
tions from biomedical text based on a set of pre-
defined patterns and words describing interactions.
Later work attempted to automatically extract inter-
actions, which are referenced in the database of in-
teracting proteins (Xenarios et al., 2000), from the
text mentioning the interactions (Blaschke and Va-
lencia, 2001). They achieved surprisingly low recall
(25%), which they attributed to problems in properly
identifying protein names in the text.
(Koike et al., 2005) developed a system called
PRIME, which was used to extract biological func-
tions of genes, proteins, and their families. Their
system used a shallow parser and sentence struc-
ture analyzer. They extracted so-called ACTOR-
OBJECT relationships from the shallow parsed sen-
tences using rule based sentence structure analysis.
The identification of BNEs was done by consulting
the GENA gene name dictionary and family name
dictionary. In extracting the biological functions of
genes and proteins, their system reported a recall of
64% and a precision of 94%.
Saric et al. developed a system to extract gene
expression regulatory information in yeast as well
as other regulatory mechanisms such phosphoryla-
tion (Saric et al., 2004; Saric et al., 2006). They
used a rule based named entity recognition module,
which recognizes named entities via cascading finite
state automata. They reported a precision of 83-90%
and 86-95% for the extraction of gene expression
and phosphorylation regulatory information respec-
tively.
(Leroy and Chen, 2005) used linguistic parsers
and Concept Spaces, which use a generic co-
occurrence based technique that extracts relevant
medical phrases using a noun chunker. Their system
employed UMLS (Humphreys and Lindberg, 1993),
GO (Ashburner et al., 2000), and GENA (Koike and
Takagi, 2004) to further improve extraction. Their
main purpose was entity identification and cross ref-
erence to other databases to obtain more knowledge
about entities involved in the system.
Other extraction approaches such as the one re-
ported on by (Cooper and Kershenbaum, 2005) uti-
lized a large manually curated dictionary of many
possible combinations of gene/protein names and
aliases from different databases and ontologies.
They annotated their corpus using a dictionary-
based longest matching technique. In addition, they
used filtering with a maximum entropy based named
entity recognizer in order to remove the false posi-
tives that were generated from merging databases.
The problem with this approach is the resulting in-
consistencies from merging databases, which could
hurt the effectiveness of the system. They reported
a recall of 87.1 % and a precision of 78.5% in the
relationship extraction task.
Work by (Mack et al., 2004) used the Munich In-
formation Center for Protein Sequences (MIPS) for
entity identification. Their system was integrated in
the IBM Unstructured Information Management Ar-
chitecture (UIMA) framework (Ferrucci and Lally,
2004) for tokenization, identification of entities, and
extraction of relations. Their approach was based on
a combination of computational linguistics, statis-
tics, and domain specific rules to detect protein in-
teractions. They reported a recall of 61% and a pre-
cision of 97%.
(Hao et al., 2005) developed an unsupervised ap-
proach, which also uses patterns that were deduced
using minimum description lengths. They used pat-
tern optimization techniques to enhance the patterns
by introducing most common keywords that tend to
describe interactions.

(J¨org et. al., 2005) developed Ali Baba which
uses sequence alignments applied to sentences an-
notated with interactions and part of speech tags.It
also uses finite state automata optimized with a ge-
netic algorithm in its approach. It then matches the
generated patterns against arbitrary text to extract in-
teractions and their respective partners. The system
scored an F1-measure of 51.8% on the LLL’05 eval-
uation set.
The aforementioned systems used either rule-
based approaches, which require manual interven-
tion from domain experts, or statistical approaches,
either supervised or semi-supervised, which also re-
quire manually curated training data.

3 BioNoculars
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997241833333333">
BioNoculars is a relationship extraction system that
based on a fully unsupervised technique suggested
by (Hassan et al., 2006) to automatically extract
protein-protein interaction from medical articles. It
can be retargeted to different domains such as pro-
tein interactions in diseases. The only requirement
is to compile domain specific taggers and dictionar-
ies, which would aid the system in performing the
required task.
The approach uses an unsupervised graph-based
mutual reinforcement, which depends on the con-
struction of generalized extraction patterns that
could match instances of relationships (Hassan et
al., 2006). Graph-based mutual reinforcement is
similar to the idea of hubs and authorities in web
pages depicted by the HITS algorithm (Kleinberg,
1998). The basic idea behind the algorithm is that
the importance of a page increases when more and
more good pages link to it. The duality between pat-
terns and extracted information (tuples) leads to the
fact that patterns could express different tuples, and
tuples in turn could be expressed by different pat-
terns. Tuple in this context contains three elements,
namely two proteins and the type of interaction be-
tween them. The proposed approach is composed of
two main steps, namely initial pattern construction
and then pattern induction.
For pattern construction, the text is POS tagged
and BNE tagged. The tags of Noun Phrases or se-
quences of nouns that constitute a BNE are removed
and replaced with a BNE tag. Then, an n-gram lan-
guage model is built on the tagged text (using tags
only) and is used to construct weighted finite state
machines. Paths with low cost (high language model
probabilities) are chosen to construct the initial set
of patterns; the intuition is that paths with low cost
(high probability) are frequent and could represent
potential candidate patterns. The number of candi-
date initial patterns could be reduced significantly
by specifying the candidate types of entities of in-
terest. In the case of BioNoculars, the focus was
on relationships between BNEs of type PROTEIN.
The candidate patterns are then applied to the tagged
stream to produce in-sentence relationship tuples.
As for pattern induction, due to the duality in the
patterns and tuples relation, patterns and tuples are
represented by a bipartite graph as illustrated in Fig-
ure 1.
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.9916985">
Figure 1: A bipartite graph representing patterns and
tuples
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.9957682">
Each pattern or tuple is represented by a node in
the graph. Edges represent matching between pat-
terns and tuples. The pattern induction problem can
be formulated as follows: Given a very large set of
data D containing a large set of patterns P, which
match a large set of tuples T, the problem is to iden-
tify , which is the set of patterns that match the set
of the most correct tuples T. The intuition is that
the tuples matched by many different patterns tend
to be correct and the patterns matching many differ-
ent tuples tend to be good patterns. In other words,
BioNoculars attempts to choose from the large space
of patterns in the data the most informative, high-
est confidence patterns that could identify correct tu-
ples; i.e. choosing the most authoritative patterns in
analogy with the hub-authority problem. The most
authoritative patterns can then be used for extracting
relations from free text. The following pattern-tuple
pairs show how patterns can match tuples in the cor-
pus:

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999962833333333">
The proposed approach represents an unsuper-
vised technique for information extraction in general
and particularly for relations extraction that requires
no seed patterns or examples and achieves signifi-
cant performance. Given enough domain text, the
extracted patterns can support many types of sen-
tences with different styles (such passive and active
voice) and orderings (the interaction of X and Y vs.
X interacts with Y).
One of the critical prerequisites of the above-
mentioned approach is the use of a POS tagger,
which is tuned for biomedical text, and a BNE tag-
ger to properly identify BNEs. Both are critical for
determining the types of relationships that are of in-
terest. For POS tagging, a decision tree based tagger
developed by (Schmid, 1994) was used in combi-
nation with a model, which was trained on a cor-
rected/revised GENIA corpus provided by (Saric et
al., 2004) and was reported to achieve 96.4% tagging
accuracy (Saric et al., 2006). This POS tagger will
be referred to as the Schmid tagger. For BNE tag-
ging, ABNER was used. The accuracy of ABNER
is approximately state of the art with precision and
recall of 74.5% and 65.9% respectively with training
done using the BioCreative corpora (BioCreative).
Nonetheless we still face entity identification prob-
lems such as missed identifications in the text which
in turn affects our results considerably. We do be-
lieve if we use a better identification method , we
would yield better results.

4 Experimental Setup
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99362725">
Experiments aimed at extracting protein-protein
interactions for Bakers yeast (Sacharomyces
Cerevesiae) to assess BioNoculars (Cherry et al.,
1998). The experiments were performed using
109,440 MEDLINE abstracts that contained the
varying names of the yeast, namely Sacharomyces
cerevisiae, S. Cerevisiae, Bakers yeast, Brewers
yeast and Budding yeast. MEDLINE abstracts
typically summarize the important aspects of papers
possibly including protein-protein interactions if
they are of relevance to the article. The goal was
to deduce the most appropriate extraction patterns
that can be later used to extract relations from any
document. All the MEDLINE abstracts were used
for pattern extraction except for 70 that were set
aside for testing. There were no test documents in
the training set. To build ground-truth, the test set
was semi-manually POS and BNE tagged. They
were also annotated with the interactions that are
contained in the text. There was a condition that
all the abstracts that are used for testing must have
entries in the Database of Interacting Proteins and
Protein-Protein Interactions (DIPPPI), which is
a subset of the Database of Interacting Proteins
(DIP) (Xenarios et al., 2000) restricted to proteins
from yeast. DIPPPI lists the known protein-protein
interactions in the MEDLINE abstracts. There were
297 protein-protein interactions in the test set of 70
abstracts. One of the disadvantages of DIPPPI is
that the presence of interactions is indicated without
mentioning their types or from which sentences
they were extracted. Although BioNoculars is able
to guess the sentence from which an interaction was
extracted and the type of interaction, this informa-
tion was ignored when evaluating against DIPPPI.
Unfortunately, there is no standard test set for the
proposed task, and most of the evaluation sets are
proprietary. The authors hope that others can benefit
from their test set, which is freely available.
The abstracts used for pattern extraction were
POS tagged using the Schmid tagger and BNE tag-
ging was done using ABNER. The patterns were re-
stricted to only those with protein names. For extrac-
tion of interaction tuples, the test set was POS and
BNE tagged using the Schmid tagger and ABNER
respectively. A varying number of final patterns
were then used to extract tuples from the test set and
the average recall and precision were computed. An-
other setup was used in which the relationships were
filtered using preset keywords for relationships such
as inhibits, interacts, and activates to properly com-
pare BioNoculars to systems in the literature that use
such keywords. The keywords were obtained from
the (Hakenberg et al., 2005) and (Temkin and Gilder,
2003). One of the generated pattern-tuple pairs was
as follows:

5 Results and Discussion

For the first set of experiments, the experimental
setup described above was used without modifica-
tion. Table 1 and Figure 2 report on the resulting
recall and precision when taking different number
of highest rated patterns. The highest rated 217 pat-
terns were divided on a linear scale into 8 clusters
based on their relative weights.

</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.991472111111111">
As expected, Figure 2 clearly shows an inverse
relationship between precision and recall. This is
because using more extraction patterns yields more
tuples thus increasing recall at the expense of pre-
cision. The F-measure (with Q = 1) peeks at 78
patterns, which seems to provide the best score
given that precision and recall are equally important.
However, the technique seems to favor recall, reach-
ing a recall of 93% when using all 217 patterns. The
low precision levels warrant thorough investigation.
In the second set of experiments, extracted tuples
were filtered using preset keywords indicating inter-
actions. Table 2 and Figure 3 show the results of the
experiments.
Figure 3: Recall, Precision, and F-measure for tu-
ple extraction using a varying number of top patterns
with keyword filtering
The results show that filtering with keywords led
to lower recall, but precision remained fairly steady
as the number of patterns changed. Nonetheless, the
best precision in Figure 3 is lower than the best pre-
cision in Figure 2 and the maximum F-measure for
this set of experiments is lower than the maximum
F-measure when no filtering was used. The BioNoc-
ulars system with no filtering can be advantageous
for recall oriented applications. The use of no filter-
ing suggests that some interaction may be expressed
in more generic forms or patterns. An intermediate
solution would be to increase the size of the list of
most commonly occurring keywords to filter the ex-
tracted tuples further.
Currently, ABNER, which is used by the system,
has a precision of 75.4% and a recall of 65.9%. Per-
haps improved tagging may improve the extraction
effectiveness.

Most of previously reported work has been tested

6 Conclusion and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998275862069">
This paper presented a system for extracting
protein-protein interaction from biomedical text call
BioNoculars. BioNoculars uses a statistical un-
supervised learning algorithm, which is based on
graph mutual reinforcement and data redundancy
to extract extraction patterns. The system is re-
call oriented and is able to properly extract 93% of
the interaction mentions from test MEDLINE ab-
stracts. Nonetheless, the systems precision remains
low. Precision can be enhanced by using keywords
that describe interactions to filter to the resulting in-
teraction, but this would be at the expense of recall.
As for future work, more attention should be fo-
cused on improving extraction patterns. Currently,
the system focuses on extracting interactions be-
tween exactly two proteins. Some of the issues that
need to be handled include complex relationship (X
and Y interact with A and B), linguistic variabil-
ity (passive vs. active voice; presence of superflu-
ous words such as modifiers, adjectives, and prepo-
sitional phrases), protein lists (W interacts with X,
Y, and Z), nested interactions (W, which interacts
with X, also interacts with Y). Resolving these is-
sues would require an investigation of how patterns
can be generalized in automatic or semi-automatic
ways. Further, the identification of proteins in the
text requires greater attention. Also, the BioNocu-
lars approach can be combined with other rule-based
approaches to produce better results.

This paper presents a statistical unsupervised system, called BioNoculars, for extracting protein-protein interactions from biomedical text. BioNoculars uses graph-based mutual reinforcement to make use of redundancy in data to construct extraction patterns in a domain independent fashion. The system was tested using MED- LINE abstract for which the protein-protein interactions that they contain are listed in the database of interacting proteins and proteinprotein interactions (DIPPPI). The system reports an F-Measure of 0.55 on test MED- LINE abstracts.</abstract>

These approaches have proven to be successful with notably good results. In these approaches, most researchers attempted to define an accurate set of rules to describe relationship types and patterns and to build ontologies and dictionaries to be consulted in the extraction process. These rules, ontologies, and dictionaries are typically domain specific and are often not generalizable to other problems. (Blaschke et al., 1999) reported a domain specific approach for extracting protein-protein interactions from biomedical text based on a set of predefined patterns and words describing interactions. Later work attempted to automatically extract interactions, which are referenced in the database of interacting proteins (Xenarios et al., 2000), from the text mentioning the interactions (Blaschke and Valencia, 2001). They achieved surprisingly low recall (25%), which they attributed to problems in properly identifying protein names in the text.

The accuracy of ABNER is approximately state of the art with precision and recall of 74.5% and 65.9% respectively with training done using the BioCreative corpora (BioCreative). Nonetheless we still face entity identification problems such as missed identifications in the text which in turn affects our results considerably. We do believe if we use a better identification method , we would yield better results. 4 Experimental Setup Experiments aimed at extracting protein-protein interactions for Bakers yeast (Sacharomyces Cerevesiae) to assess BioNoculars (Cherry et al., 1998). The experiments were performed using 109,440 MEDLINE abstracts that contained the varying names of the yeast, namely Sacharomyces cerevisiae, S. Cerevisiae, Bakers yeast, Brewers yeast and Budding yeast. MEDLINE abstracts typically summarize the important aspects of papers possibly including protein-protein interactions if they are of relevance to the article. The goal was to deduce the most appropriate extraction patterns that can be later used to extract relations from any document. All the MEDLINE abstracts were used for pattern extraction except for 70 that were set aside for testing. Th</context>

These 5,000 journals constitute only a subset of the published biomedical research. Further, medical articles often contain redundant information and only subsections of articles are typically of direct interest to researchers. More advanced information extraction tools have been developed to effectively distill medical articles to produce key pieces of information from articles while attempting to eliminate redundancy. These tools have focused on areas such as protein-protein interaction, gene-disease relationship, and chemical-protein interaction (Chun et al., 2006). Many of these tools have been used to extract key pieces of information from MEDLINE. Most of the reported information extraction approaches use sets of handcrafted rules in conjunction with manually curated dictionaries and ontologies. This paper presents a fully unsupervised statistical technique to discover protein-protein interaction based on automatically discoverable repeating patterns in text that describe relationships. The paper is organized as follows: section 2 surveys related work; section 3 describes BioNoculars; Section 4 describes the employed experimental setup; section 5 rep</context>

Rule-based systems (Fukuda et al., 1998; Hanisch et al., 2003; Yamamoto et al., 2003) that use dictionaries tend to exhibit high precision in tagging named entities but generally with lower tagging recall. They tend to lag the latest published research and are sensitive to the expression of the named entities. Dictionaries of BNE are typically laborious and expensive to build, and they are dependant on nomenclatures and specific species. Statistical approaches (Collier et al., 2000; Kazama et al., 2002; Settles, 2004) typically improve recall at the expense of precision, but are more readily retargetable for new nomenclatures and organisms. Hybrid systems (Tanabe and Wilbur, 2002; Mika and Rost, 2004) attempt to take advantage of both approaches. Although these approaches tend to generate acceptable recognition, they are heavily dependent on the type of data on which they are trained. (Fukuda et al., 1998) proposed a rule-based protein name extraction system called PROPER (PROtein Proper-noun phrase Extracting Rules) system, which utilizes a set of rules based on the su</context>

Results showed that their system achieved a 0.80 F-measure score in the name extraction task on the BioCreative test set (BioCreative). (Yamamoto et al., 2003) proposed the use of morphological analysis to improve protein name tagging. Their approach tags proteins based on morpheme chunking to properly determine protein name boundary. They used the GENIA corpus for training and testing and obtained an F-measure score of 0.70 for protein name tagging. (Collier et al., 2000) used a machine learning approach to protein name extraction based on a linear interpolation Hidden Markov Model (HMM) trained using bi-grams. They focused on finding the most likely protein sequence classes (C) for a given sequence of words (W), by maximizing the probability of C given W, P(C—W). Unlike traditional dictionary based methods, the approach uses no manually crafted patterns. However, their approach may misidentify term boundaries for phrases containing potentially ambiguous local structures such as coordination and parenthesis.

Rule-based systems (Fukuda et al., 1998; Hanisch et al., 2003; Yamamoto et al., 2003) that use dictionaries tend to exhibit high precision in tagging named entities but generally with lower tagging recall. They tend to lag the latest published research and are sensitive to the expression of the named entities. Dictionaries of BNE are typically laborious and expensive to build, and they are dependant on nomenclatures and specific species. Statistical approaches (Collier et al., 2000; Kazama et al., 2002; Settles, 2004) typically improve recall at the expense of precision, but are more readily retargetable for new nomenclatures and o</context>

The approach uses an unsupervised graph-based mutual reinforcement, which depends on the construction of generalized extraction patterns that could match instances of relationships (Hassan et al., 2006). Graph-based mutual reinforcement is similar to the idea of hubs and authorities in web pages depicted by the HITS algorithm (Kleinberg, 1998). The basic idea behind the algorithm is that the importance of a page increases when more and more good pages link to it. The duality between patterns and extracted information (tuples) leads to the fact that patterns could express different tuples, and tuples in turn could be expressed by different patterns. Tuple in this context contains three elements, namely two proteins and the type of interaction between them.

Later work attempted to automatically extract interactions, which are referenced in the database of interacting proteins (Xenarios et al., 2000), from the text mentioning the interactions (Blaschke and Valencia, 2001).

A key step in their method is the extraction of multi-word gene and protein names that are dominant in the corpus but inaccessible to the POS tagger. The advantage of such an approach is that it is independent of any biomedical domain. However, it can miss single word gene names that do not occur in contextual gene theme terms. It can also incorrectly tag compound gene names, plasmids, and phages. (Mika and Rost, 2004) developed NLProt, which 90 combines the use of dictionaries, rules-based filtering, and machine learning based on an SVM classifier to tag protein names in MEDLINE. The NLProt system used rules for pre-filtering and the SVM for classification, and it achieved a precision of 75% and recall 76%. 2.2 Relationship Extraction As for the extraction of interactions, most efforts in extraction of biomedical interactions between entities from text have focused on using rule-based approaches due to the familiarity of medical terms that tend to describe interactions.

One of the critical prerequisites of the abovementioned approach is the use of a POS tagger, which is tuned for biomedical text, and a BNE tagger to properly identify BNEs. Both are critical for determining the types of relationships that are of interest. For POS tagging, a decision tree based tagger developed by (Schmid, 1994) was used in combination with a model, which was trained on a corrected/revised GENIA corpus provided by (Saric et al., 2004) and was reported to achieve 96.4% tagging accuracy (Saric et al., 2006). This POS tagger will be referred to as the Schmid tagger. For BNE tagging, ABNER was used. The accuracy of ABNER is approximately state of the art with precision and recall of 74.5% and 65.9% respectively with training done using the BioCreative corpora (BioCreative). Nonetheless we still face entity identification problems such as missed identifications in the text which in turn affects our results considerably.

These rules, ontologies, and dictionaries are typically domain specific and are often not generalizable to other problems. (Blaschke et al., 1999) reported a domain specific approach for extracting protein-protein interactions from biomedical text based on a set of predefined patterns and words describing interactions. Later work attempted to automatically extract interactions, which are referenced in the database of interacting proteins (Xenarios et al., 2000), from the text mentioning the interactions (Blaschke and Valencia, 2001). They achieved surprisingly low recall (25%), which they attributed to problems in properly identifying protein names in the text. (Koike et al., 2005) developed a system called PRIME, which was used to extract biological functions of genes, proteins, and their families.

All the MEDLINE abstracts were used for pattern extraction except for 70 that were set aside for testing. There were no test documents in the training set. To build ground-truth, the test set was semi-manually POS and BNE tagged. They were also annotated with the interactions that are contained in the text. There was a condition that all the abstracts that are used for testing must have entries in the Database of Interacting Proteins and Protein-Protein Interactions (DIPPPI), which is a subset of the Database of Interacting Proteins (DIP) (Xenarios et al., 2000) restricted to proteins from yeast. DIPPPI lists the known protein-protein interactions in the MEDLINE abstracts. There were 297 protein-protein interactions in the test set of 70 abstracts. One of the disadvantages of DIPPPI is that the presence of interactions is indicated without mentioning their types or from which sentences they were extracted. Although BioNoculars is able to guess the sentence from which an interaction was extracted and the type of interaction, this information was ignored when evaluating against DIPPPI. Unfortunately, there is no standard test set for the proposed task,</context>

Results showed that their system achieved a 0.80 F-measure score in the name extraction task on the BioCreative test set (BioCreative). (Yamamoto et al., 2003) proposed the use of morphological analysis to improve protein name tagging. Their approach tags proteins based on morpheme chunking to properly determine protein name boundary. They used the GENIA corpus for training and testing and obtained an F-measure score of 0.70 for protein name tagging. (Collier et al., 2000) used a machine learning approach to protein name extraction based on a linear interpolation Hidden Markov Model (HMM) trained using bi-grams.
