might call the &amp;quot;world knowledge/deep reasoning&amp;quot; school of
thought, which is the current paradigm in AI, engendered
by Charniak&apos;s dissertation. He introduces frames, scripts
and plans, MOPS, and information formats (from the
Linguistic String Project, NYU). The chapter concludes
with a discussion of handling dialogue. Although there is a
good discussion of some points, this chapter is somewhat
disappointing because many areas of research are left out
or no examples are given: classic pragmatics is not dis-
cussed at all, story and text grammars are only mentioned,
MOPs are only mentioned, and no mention is made of
rhetorical structure theory. Perhaps the author felt that
this area was not very well settled and therefore should not
be treated extensively. Graduate students, however, should
be treated to open problems as well as to (purported)
solutions.
The language generation chapter is quite brief and treats
sentence generation from a syntactic point of view. A short
discussion on text generation completes the chapter. Clearly,
more could be done with generation even if it is &amp;quot;the poor
cousin&amp;quot; of automated language research.
Grishman spends little time trying to fill in the technical
linguistic background of the reader. There are short intro-
ductions to the Chomsky hierarchy of grammars and pred-
icate logic, but the reader is mostly presumed to be conver-
sant with linguistic theory. The book is, after all, about
computational linguistics. The amount of introductory ma-
terial seems reasonable relative to the expository material.
For computer science graduate students, however, this
account would have to be supplemented with more introduc-
tory linguistics material. The book also contains little philo-
sophical discussion. The author does not attempt to address
the problem of defining meaning, let alone the role of
meaning and language for the concept of mind (a hot topic
for some cognitive psychologists and philosophers). Admit-
tedly, such discussions can become abstruse and perhaps
not very useful, and Grishman typically avoids such topics.
The author frequently writes short evaluations of previ-
ous efforts in an attempt to weigh the contribution of the
work. The evaluations seem very fair; Grishman does not
take doctrinaire stances toward different approaches to
natural language, an excellent way to write an introductory
text. One nice touch of the book is the pursuit of topics
through several different chapters. For example, the prob-
lem of quantifier ordering is discussed both in the semantics
chapter as a representation problem and in the language
generation chapter. Various such themes are pursued
throughout the book.
In summary, this introductory text takes a stand, a point
of view, toward the computational linguistics field. It can
be used most profitably in classes with students who al-
ready have some linguistics background. If supplemented
with additional material, it could also be used for courses
populated by computer science students. The book is inter-
estingly written with many insightful discussions, and it is
the only (introductory) computational linguistics textbook
that looks at the field from a linguist&apos;s point of view.

OVERVIEW
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999419142857143">
In Speaking, Pim Levelt has written a majestic book. It is
majestic in its scope, in the power and elegance of its
writing, and in the regal authority with which it describes
cognitive structures and processes that are almost inaccessi-
ble to experimental study. It discusses in 12 chapters how a
speaker produces fluent speech, from concept and intention
to articulation. It is hard to believe that one person could
attempt such a task, let alone that he could complete it so
well. The book is intended primarily for advanced students
in psycholinguistics, but we find it to be better suited to
students of computational linguistics, since we think Levelt
has described how speaking could be done, but not necessar-
ily how it is done by humans.
The book contains many technical terms and concepts,
clearly introduced and used, and avoids statistics and com-
puter jargon. Very occasionally, traces of Dutch creep in,
though not obtrusively. Blackboardchalk, passingnote, and
swimmingwater are given as examples of English com-
pound words; bank is said to have as its two meanings
&amp;quot;financial institution&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;furniture&amp;quot;. Despite these small
lapses, Levelt&apos;s knowledge about English (as well as his
ability to use it) far surpasses that of most English speakers
untrained in linguistics.
The book is well designed and carefully proofread. There
is a good index, and more than 600 references. We found
only three misprints in 500 pages of text, as well as one
&amp;quot;cognitive misprint&amp;quot; that is amusing because it occurs in a
discussion of similar phenomena in speech (the commen-

tary on Example 8, p. 248). Didactically, every chapter
starts with a discussion of what each section says, and
finishes with a good summary. Many sections repeat this
plan.
Overall, despite the deeply technical nature of the con-
tent, the book is easy to read and persuasive, perhaps
seductive, in its argument.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.918685">
THE MODEL
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999944064516129">
The model Levelt describes for the production of speech
consists of three major modules plus a store of declarative
knowledge called the Lexicon. In addition, the speech
recognition system is called into play for monitoring the
resulting speech. A module called the Conceptualizer takes
the ideas to be transmitted and structures them into a
formal grammar much like a phrase-structure grammar,
that uses types such as EVENT, PLACE, and PATH as its
elements. The result is a preverbal message, which is passed
to another module called a Formulator, which has two
components, a grammatical encoder that creates a sentence
pattern (surface structure), and a phonological encoder
that produces a &amp;quot;phonetic plan.&amp;quot; The phonetic plan is the
output of the Formulator.
The Formulator (and only the Formulator) has access to
the Lexicon, which contains all known words in the form of
Lemmas and Forms. Lemmas are defined as bundles of
declarative knowledge about a word&apos;s meaning and gram-
mar (p. 236), and are used by the grammatical encoder.
Forms contain similar knowledge about the morphology
and phonology of the words, and are used by the phonologi-
cal encoder. The phonetic plan that the Formulator pro-
duces is the input to the final module, the Articulator,
which turns it into audible (overt) speech that an experi-
menter or observer can study.
An important feature of the design is that no feedback is
allowed to occur between the modules. Grammatical and
phonological encoding are placed within a single module
(the Formulator), because there must be a small amount of
feedback between them. A second design feature is that the
model works in an incremental fashion. Items are output by
a module as soon as the required information is available,
and are (normally) used immediately by the next module;
considerable ingenuity goes into making designs for the
different components that minimize the amount of look-
ahead required.
Speech errors are a major source of information about
the way we speak, and Levelt uses error data to check many
aspects of his model. But he makes little mention of the
apparent fact that errors that satisfy the context at more
than one level are preferred to errors that do not (e.g.
Freudian slips tend to satisfy conceptual, syntactic, and
phonological contexts). Such an acknowledgment might
cast some doubt on the modular separation of the speaking
processes. Consider I&apos;ll go shut up the darn bore for I&apos;ll go
shut up the barn door (Dell 1988). At the phonological
level, two initial speech sounds of the two words, barn and
door, are exchanged; at the word level, darn and bore are
real words, not nonsense words; darn bore is a clichÃ©; and
finally, the speaker was thinking of, or wishing to shut up, a
darn bore.
The book, especially the central section, is based on
&amp;quot;theoretical notions . . . [that] mostly stem from linguistics
and computer science&amp;quot; rather than from psychology. Levelt
might well have added &amp;quot;from the symbol-manipulation
school of computer science.&amp;quot; From time to time, especially
in the later chapters in which the processes are near to overt
speech, he does refer extensively to psychological studies
that are consistent with the machinery being constructed,
but it is never clear that the studies force particular construc-
tions as opposed to alternative possibilities, even within the
symbolist paradigm.

PLAN OF THE BOOK
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.980558678571429">
Chapters 1 and 2 form an introductory section, presenting
an overview of the model and setting the activity of speak-
ing into its conversational context.
Chapter 1 describes the modular structure of the speak-
ing machine and shows the actions of the different modules
through the analysis of one utterance in a conversational
fragment. Chapter 2 concludes the introduction to the
book. It deals with the interaction between two talkers,
showing the context in which most speech is produced, and
introducing the concepts of communicative intention and of
shared situational context between the conversational part-
ners. The chapter describes such &amp;quot;standard&amp;quot; topics as turn
taking, Grice&apos;s (1975) cooperative principle and its four
maxims (e.g. quality: do not say what you believe to be
false), and speech acts (a speaker&apos;s utterance such as &amp;quot;A
train is coming&amp;quot; communicates her intention such as warn-
ing or informing, as well as conveying a proposition that
can be true or false). However, the chapter is not strong on
the local and global coherence found in conversation.
The rest of the book is concerned with how concepts
within a talker are turned into sound patterns. Chapters 3
and 4 deal with the Conceptualizer, 5 to 10 with the
Formulator and its interaction with the Lexicon, 11 with
the Articulator, and 12 with the problem of self-monitoring
and self-repair. It is only in Chapter 12 that the listener
reappears, in a trivial way, to provide signals to the talker
that self-repair may be necessary.
Chapter 3 describes the structure of a preverbal mes-
sage, and relates the message to the nonlinguistic represen-
tation and manipulation of concepts. Preverbal messages
are constructed only out of propositional representations,
not from spatial, kinaesthetic, or other forms. These repre-
sentations must be turned into a propositional form before
the speech production system can do its work. A cognitive
concept contains, in parallel, several relations among a
group of entities. John visited Mary in hospital and gave
her flowers is an ordered presentation of a situated event
that could easily have been presented as The flowers Mary
got in hospital were given to her by John. The processing
modules frequently must order as a sequence things that
are presented in parallel.
Computational Linguistics Volume 16, Number 1, March 1990 53
Book Reviews Speaking: From Intention to Articulation
The Conceptualizer turns a propositional representation
of a concept into a &amp;quot;message,&amp;quot; which refers to events in the
world and predicates (e.g. assertions, denials) about them.
It has propositional structure, function/argument struc-
ture, and thematic structure.
Chapter 4 deals with the generation of a preverbal
message from a communicative intention, and it is with this
chapter that the serious work of describing the speaking
process begins. If Simon wants to ask Hanna Will you buy
a stamp? he uses procedural knowledge of how to convert
patterns of goals into messages. Simon&apos;s procedural knowl-
edge is formally analyzed as:
if the goal state is
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.480116">
KNOW (H, INTEND (S, INTENDED (H, DO
(A))))
then encode message
? (FUTURE (DO (H, A))))
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999978411764706">
where A is the intended action and H the hearer. That
Simon has this procedural knowledge is inferred from the
request he produced.
Chapters 5 to 7 deal with the first part of the Formulator,
the grammatical encoding from preverbal message to sur-
face structure. Grammatical encoding takes a preverbal
message as input and delivers a surface structure as output.
It is lexically driven; it generates incrementally, from left to
right; and it generates major sentence constituents in paral-
lel.
Chapter 6 describes the structure of entries in the Lexi-
con. Each word has a four-component entry: meaning,
syntactic use, morphology, and phonology. Meaning and
syntax are used by the grammatical encoder, and morphol-
ogy and phonology by the phonological encoder. A word is
selected because it fits semantically with the concept to be
encoded. For example give (p. 189) is
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.996410142857143">
EVENT (CAUSE,
PERSON (X),
EVENT (GO [ [poss]] ,
THING (Y),
PATH (FROM/TO,
PERSON (X),
PERSON (Z))))
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999910194029851">
where it is important that the three arguments X, Y, and Z
be PERSON, THING, PERSON. But then in a footnote,
Levelt says that this might be too restrictive, and cites The
bright lights gave Santa&apos;s arrival a colorful appearance,
which has none of the required argument types.
The Santa example shows one of the difficulties of Lev-
elt&apos;s symbolist approach: the concept represented in the
Santa example as give has little in common with the give in
John gave Mary a book, John gave Mary a cold, John gave
Mary a hard time, John gave up, or John gave up the
ghost. There is, to be sure, some semantic overlap among
the six concepts, but it is hard, if not impossible, to give (a
seventh use of give) a context-free definition of give that
will satisfy all of them without at the same time applying to
concepts that are not well represented by give. There is no
context-free mapping from concept to word in natural
language. Therefore the matching of conceptual specifica-
tion such as that presented above for give to the lexicon
entry for give can be neither a necessary nor a sufficient
condition for the selection of give in overt speech. But in
Leven design, all hinges on this selection from the Lexi-
con. One worries.
Chapters 8 to 10 move from the surface structure gener-
ated by the grammatical encoder to the phonetic plan, an
internal form of speech in which all the phones are se-
quenced preparatory to feeding the Articulator module. In
this section of the book, there is much more consideration
of real psychological data, largely observations of natural
or induced speech errors. The types of errors that do and do
not occur are illuminating, and do provide tests of possible
models, though the tests may not be as strong as Levelt
seems sometimes to claim.
Chapter 11 deals with the actual process of articulating
the phone string output by the Formulator. It is here that
there is most experimental evidence, and it is here that
Levelt acknowledges most frequently doubt about what
actually happens. Perhaps for this reason, the chapter is
one of the most interesting in the book. There is perhaps a
little more emphasis on cognitive control as compared with
mechanical dynamics than one might like; for example, CV
formant transition rates do not change much, if at all, with
speaking rate, and yet Levelt uses lack of control of transi-
tion rates as an argument against some theories.
The final chapter, Chapter 12, has a very interesting
discussion on the linguistic constraints that govern the
forms of self-repair. It is, of course, necessary that any
self-repair be marked as such for the listener. To ensure
that this marking occurs, the talker must use signals that
are known to the listener. These signals must either be
universal and inbuilt or culturally and linguistically deter-
mined. Whichever they are, they must be readily detected,
and thus should be possible to describe linguistically. Levelt
shows that they are, and describes a few of the principles
that allow the listener to determine which parts of the
already-received message should be altered. He also uses
some of the timing effects of self-repair to assist in determin-
ing at what stage of the speech process the error is detected
and at what stage it is repaired.
And then the book stops.
An epilogue is probably not required, but when one turns
from page 499 to page 500, one is surprised to find not a
summation, but a table of IPA phonetic symbols. To com-
plain about this abrupt stop may seem like carping, but in
such a well-written and well-paced book, one expects an
elegant completion. Rather, it feels as if the contract said
that there should be no more than 500 pages of text, and
that&apos;s where it had to stop.

Book Reviews Speaking: From Intention to Articulation
PROBLEM AREAS
</note>
<bodyText confidence="0.999965511111112">
Speaking is a book that lies between engineering and
science. It describes brilliantly how an intelligent speaking
machine might be built using concepts that computer scien-
tists now understand, and it points out ways in which the
speech of the machine would be like human speech. But the
book purports to be more than that: it claims to describe in
considerable detail how humans do speak. To support this
claim requires access to more data than present-day exper-
iments can provide.
It is intrinsically hard to study experimentally how hu-
mans speak in a natural conversational context. The mere
fact that experimental conditions are imposed on the talk-
ers is enough to ensure that the conversation is unnatural,
since the talkers are pursuing goals imposed by the experi-
menter rather than goals of their own. This difference has
an immediate impact on many aspects of the conversation,
especially on the emotional involvement of the participants,
which may be reflected in aspects ranging from intonation
and word choice to the global coherence of the topics and
the linking structures used to maintain that coherence.
Researchers in automatic speech recognition are well aware
of these effects.
If the study of speaking cannot be an experimental
science like physics and chemistry, it must be an observa-
tional science like astronomy and geology. But just as
physics and chemistry can help us to understand the obser-
vations of astronomy and geology, so can experiments on
the microstructures of speaking help us to understand our
observations of natural speech. Physics is a much simpler
science than psychology, and the interior of a supernova
much simpler than that of a human brain. How likely is it,
then, that the complex structures and processes described
by Levelt actually occur in the brain when people speak?
If we treat the book as an engineering design for a
speaking machine, rather than as a scientific description of
how humans really speak, we are on safer ground. Levelt,
perhaps unconsciously, acknowledges as much in the differ-
ence between his treatment of processes close to the overt
production of sound and that of deeper, more &amp;quot;cognitive&amp;quot;
processes. For the peripheral processes, about which exper-
imental results are available, he presents several models
and frequently comments that we just don&apos;t know the real
answer; but for the deeper processes that require much
speculative interpretation of observations, he presents a
formal structure and in most cases asserts that this is the
way things are. It is hard to accept that we can be more
assured of the processes for which we have little informa-
tion than about those for which experimental data are
available.
The first main problem area is thus that the descriptions
in the book can be considered only as plausible, not defini-
tive as Levelt seems to claim.
The machine Levelt has designed is a parallel and incre-
mental production-rule system. Rules are executed as soon
as their conditions are true and not otherwise. This commit-
ment to a binary logic is weakened in places, when he talks
about levels of activation and priming effects, but it is an
underlying theme of the whole structure. On the few occa-
sions he does mention connectionism, he confuses it with
spreading activation and semantic networks, and even these
(still symbolist) ideas are given short shrift. Distributed
representations are simply not mentioned. As a result, some
of the complex mechanisms of the design remind one of
Ptolemaic epicycles, which did describe planetary motions
quite well. Epicycles had to be proliferated if one required
that all motion be circular; rules must be proliferated if one
requires that all cognitive function be symbolic, logical, and
binary. We know that distributed processes probably under-
lie any brain function, and may well work in parallel with
the symbolic processes at an overt level. So, the second
main problem area is the concentration on symbolic repre-
sentations and processes to the exclusion of distributed ones
that might make some effects easier to understand and to
describe.
The third main problem area is that although Chapter 2
is devoted to the conversational context of speech, only a
little attention is given to that context as a determiner of
the forms of speech. For example, the underlying base unit
of speech is taken to be the &amp;quot;message,&amp;quot; which has a
one-to-one correspondence with the grammatical &amp;quot;sen-
tence.&amp;quot; If a message yields an utterance that is less than a
well-formed grammatical sentence, it is considered to be an
elliptic message, and the evidence that a message is elliptic
is that the utterance lacks some elements of a literary
sentence. But in conversation, an utterance is supposed to
convey information or affect the listener&apos;s behavior. To
include sentence elements that are already in high focus for
the listener is to convey a different message than to omit
them. A string that is elliptic in literary grammar may well
be complete in conversational grammar.

FINAL COMMENTS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.977589176470588">
In summary, Levelt&apos;s book should be important for compu-
tational linguists. Its main flaw, as seen from the psycholog-
ical viewpoint, is contained in the statement on page 39:
&amp;quot;No finite set of rules can ever delineate the full set of
well-formed conversations.&amp;quot; This statement probably ap-
plies to every aspect of natural language. If so, it denies the
premise on which the whole production-rule system of the
book is based.
We do think that rule-based systems are a part of natural
language production (and reception), but we do not think
they are the whole of it. Distributed representations and
processes probably are at least as important. The toy
connectionist systems implemented to date must be unlike
those that underlie brain behavior, but even they have
shown that simple networks can perform in a robust way
functions that are not easy for rule-based systems. NetTalk
(Sejnowski and Rosenberg 1987), for example, can do a
tolerable job of turning an orthographic string into a phone
string, using no phone-specific or lexical information at any
node in the net, after being exposed to the correct pronunci-

Book Reviews Briefly Noted
ation of many strings. Rule-based systems can do better,
but the rules are based on years of study by phoneticians,
and are not only complex, but are supplemented by large
lists of lexical exceptions.
Presumably a connectionist system that could be taught
rules as well as learn from example would outperform both
versions; and that is what a human seems to beâ€”a system
that can be taught rules and that can learn by example how
to apply and when to bend the rules. Levelt&apos;s machine is not
human-like in this respect. It knows and uses rules. It may
even abstract rules from multiple examples. But the rules of
the machine do not allow easy context-dependence, anal-
ogy, or the use of similarity.
One of our annoyances with this fine book is that very
often, a point is settled, without evidence, by a comment
that so-and-so is very unlikely. In many of these cases we
find so-and-so to be quite probable. A typical example is the
comment (p. 18) that it is &amp;quot;an unlikely assumption that the
speaker articulates sentence i while formulating sentence
i + 1.&amp;quot; On the contrary, it seems to us unlikely that the
speaker ever articulates just one sentence without at the
same time formulating future sentences that contribute to a
developing argument. This is a difference of opinion that is
unlikely to be resolved by experiment, but it illustrates the
general point.
In sum, our reaction to the book as an engineering design
for a machine that might speak like a human is
&amp;quot;magnificent,&amp;quot; but as a description of how people speak,
&amp;quot;we remain unconvinced.&amp;quot;

He introduces frames, scripts and plans, MOPS, and information formats (from the Linguistic String Project, NYU). The chapter concludes with a discussion of handling dialogue. Although there is a good discussion of some points, this chapter is somewhat disappointing because many areas of research are left out or no examples are given: classic pragmatics is not discussed at all, story and text grammars are only mentioned, MOPs are only mentioned, and no mention is made of rhetorical structure theory. Perhaps the author felt that this area was not very well settled and therefore should not be treated extensively. Graduate students, however, should be treated to open problems as well as to (purported) solutions. The language generation chapter is quite brief and treats sentence generation from a syntactic point of view. A short discussion on text generation completes the chapter. Clearly, more could be done with generation even if it is &amp;quot;the poor cousin&amp;quot; of automated language research. Grishman spends little time trying to fill in the technical linguistic background of the reader. There are short introductions to the Chomsky hierarchy of grammars and predicate logic, but the reader is mostly presumed to be conversant with linguistic theory. The book is, after all, about The amount of introductory material seems reasonable relative to the expository material. For computer science graduate students, however, this account would have to be supplemented with more introductory linguistics material. The book also contains little philosophical discussion. The author does not attempt to address the problem of defining meaning, let alone the role of meaning and language for the concept of mind (a hot topic for some cognitive psychologists and philosophers). Admittedly, such discussions can become abstruse and perhaps not very useful, and Grishman typically avoids such topics. The author frequently writes short evaluations of previous efforts in an attempt to weigh the contribution of the work. The evaluations seem very fair; Grishman does not take doctrinaire stances toward different approaches to natural language, an excellent way to write an introductory text. One nice touch of the book is the pursuit of topics through several different chapters. For example, the problem of quantifier ordering is discussed both in the semantics chapter as a representation problem and in the language generation chapter. Various such themes are pursued throughout the book. In summary, this introductory text takes a stand, a point of view, toward the computational linguistics field. It can be used most profitably in classes with students who already have some linguistics background. If supplemented with additional material, it could also be used for courses populated by computer science students. The book is interestingly written with many insightful discussions, and it is the only (introductory) computational linguistics textbook that looks at the field from a linguist&apos;s point of view.</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.992628551401869">Levelt has written a majestic book. It is majestic in its scope, in the power and elegance of its writing, and in the regal authority with which it describes cognitive structures and processes that are almost inaccessible to experimental study. It discusses in 12 chapters how a fluent speech, from and intention to articulation. It is hard to believe that one person could attempt such a task, let alone that he could complete it so well. The book is intended primarily for advanced students in psycholinguistics, but we find it to be better suited to students of computational linguistics, since we think Levelt has described how speaking could be done, but not necessarily how it is done by humans. The book contains many technical terms and concepts, clearly introduced and used, and avoids statistics and computer jargon. Very occasionally, traces of Dutch creep in, not obtrusively. passingnote, given as examples of English comwords; said to have as its two meanings &amp;quot;financial institution&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;furniture&amp;quot;. Despite these small Levelt&apos;s knowledge about English well as ability to use it) far surpasses that of most English speakers untrained in linguistics. The book is well designed and carefully proofread. There is a good index, and more than 600 references. We found only three misprints in 500 pages of text, as well as one &amp;quot;cognitive misprint&amp;quot; that is amusing because it occurs in a of similar phenomena in speech (the commen- 52 Computational Linguistics Volume 16, Number 1, March 1990 Book Reviews Speaking: From Intention to Articulation tary on Example 8, p. 248). Didactically, every chapter starts with a discussion of what each section says, and finishes with a good summary. Many sections repeat this plan. Overall, despite the deeply technical nature of the content, the book is easy to read and persuasive, perhaps seductive, in its argument. THE MODEL The model Levelt describes for the production of speech consists of three major modules plus a store of declarative called the addition, the speech recognition system is called into play for monitoring the speech. A module called the the ideas to be transmitted and structures them into a formal grammar much like a phrase-structure grammar, that uses types such as EVENT, PLACE, and PATH as its elements. The result is a preverbal message, which is passed another module called a has two components, a grammatical encoder that creates a sentence pattern (surface structure), and a phonological encoder that produces a &amp;quot;phonetic plan.&amp;quot; The phonetic plan is the output of the Formulator. The Formulator (and only the Formulator) has access to the Lexicon, which contains all known words in the form of are defined as bundles of declarative knowledge about a word&apos;s meaning and grammar (p. 236), and are used by the grammatical encoder. Forms contain similar knowledge about the morphology and phonology of the words, and are used by the phonological encoder. The phonetic plan that the Formulator prois the input to the final module, the which turns it into audible (overt) speech that an experimenter or observer can study. An important feature of the design is that no feedback is allowed to occur between the modules. Grammatical and phonological encoding are placed within a single module (the Formulator), because there must be a small amount of feedback between them. A second design feature is that the model works in an incremental fashion. Items are output by a module as soon as the required information is available, and are (normally) used immediately by the next module; considerable ingenuity goes into making designs for the different components that minimize the amount of lookahead required. Speech errors are a major source of information about the way we speak, and Levelt uses error data to check many aspects of his model. But he makes little mention of the apparent fact that errors that satisfy the context at more than one level are preferred to errors that do not (e.g. Freudian slips tend to satisfy conceptual, syntactic, and phonological contexts). Such an acknowledgment might cast some doubt on the modular separation of the speaking Consider go shut up the darn bore go up the barn door 1988). At the phonological two initial speech sounds of the two words, are exchanged; at the word level, words, not nonsense words; bore a clichÃ©; and finally, the speaker was thinking of, or wishing to shut up, a darn bore. The book, especially the central section, is based on &amp;quot;theoretical notions . . . [that] mostly stem from linguistics and computer science&amp;quot; rather than from psychology. Levelt might well have added &amp;quot;from the symbol-manipulation school of computer science.&amp;quot; From time to time, especially in the later chapters in which the processes are near to overt speech, he does refer extensively to psychological studies that are consistent with the machinery being constructed, but it is never clear that the studies force particular constructions as opposed to alternative possibilities, even within the symbolist paradigm. PLAN OF THE BOOK Chapters 1 and 2 form an introductory section, presenting an overview of the model and setting the activity of speaking into its conversational context. Chapter 1 describes the modular structure of the speaking machine and shows the actions of the different modules through the analysis of one utterance in a conversational</abstract>

If so, it denies the premise on which the whole production-rule system of the book is based. We do think that rule-based systems are a part of natural language production (and reception), but we do not think they are the whole of it. Distributed representations and processes probably are at least as important. The toy connectionist systems implemented to date must be unlike those that underlie brain behavior, but even they have shown that simple networks can perform in a robust way functions that are not easy for rule-based systems. NetTalk (Sejnowski and Rosenberg 1987), for example, can do a tolerable job of turning an orthographic string into a phone string, using no phone-specific or lexical information at any node in the net, after being exposed to the correct pronunciComputational Linguistics Volume 16, Number 1, March 1990 55 Book Reviews Briefly Noted ation of many strings.
