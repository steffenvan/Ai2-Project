ing a modified version of the link parser (Sleator
and Temperley, 1992).
The BioLiterate system is quite general in ap-
plicability, but in our work so far we have focused
on the specific task of extracting relationships re-
garding interactions between genes, proteins and
malignancies contained in, or implicit among mul-
tiple, biomedical research abstracts. This applica-
tion is critical because the extraction of pro-
tein/gene/disease relationships from text is neces-
sary for the discovery of metabolic pathways and
non-trivial disease causal chains, among other ap-
plications (N6dellec, 2005; Davulcu, 2005, Ah-
med, 2005).
Systems extracting these sorts of relationships
from text have been developed using a variety of
technologies, including support vector machines
(Donaldson et al, 2003), maximum entropy models
and graph algorithms (McDonald, 2005), Markov
models and first order logic (Riedel, 2005) and
finite state automata (Hakenberg, 2005). How-
ever, these systems are limited in the relationships
that they can extract. Most of them focus on rela-
tionships described in single sentences. The results
we report here support the hypothesis that the
methods embodied in BioLiterate, when developed
beyond the prototype level and implemented in a
scalable way, may be significantly more powerful,
particularly in the extraction of relationships whose
textual description exists in multiple sentences or
multiple documents.
Overall, the extraction of both entities and sin-
gle-sentence-embodied inter-entity relationships
has proved far more difficult in the biomedical
domain than in other domains such as newspaper
text (N6dellec, 2005; Jing et al, 2003; Pyysalo,
2004). One reason for this is the lack of resources,
such as large tagged corpora, to allow statistical
NLP systems to perform as well as in the news
domain. Another is that biomedical text has many
features that are quite uncommon or even non-
existent in newspaper text (Pyysalo, 2004), such as
numerical post-modifiers of nouns (Serine 38),
non-capitalized entity names (ÉftsY is solely ex-
pressed during...), hyphenated verbs (X cross-links
Y), nominalizations, and uncommon usage of pa-
rentheses (sigma(H)-dependent expression of
spo0A). While recognizing the critical importance
of overcoming these issues more fully, we have not
addressed them in any novel way in the context of
our work on BioLiterate, but have rather chosen to
focus attention on the other end of the pipeline:
using inference to piece together relationships ex-
tracted from separate sentences, to construct new
relationships implicit among multiple sentences or
documents.
The BioLiterate system incorporates three main
components: an NLP system that outputs entities,
dependencies and basic semantic relations; a prob-
abilistic reasoning system (PLN = Probabilistic
Logic Networks); and a collection of hand-built
semantic mapping rules used to mediate between
the two prior components.
One of the hypotheses underlying our work is
that the use of probabilistic inference in a bioNLP
context may allow the capturing of relationships
not covered by existing systems, particularly those
that are implicit or spread among several abstracts.
This application of BioLiterate is reminiscent of
the Arrowsmith system (Smalheiser and Swanson,
1998), which is focused on creating novel bio-
medical discoveries via combining pieces of in-
formation from different research texts; however,
Arrowsmith is oriented more toward guiding hu-
mans to make discoveries via well-directed litera-
ture search, rather than more fully automating the
discovery process via unified NLP and inference.
Our work with the BioLiterate prototype has
tentatively validated this hypothesis via the pro-
duction of interesting examples, e.g. of conceptu-
ally straightforward deductions combining prem-
ises contained in different research papers.1 Our
future research will focus on providing more sys-
tematic statistical validation of this hypothesis.

For the purpose of running initial experiments
with the BioLiterate system, we restricted our at-
tention to texts from the domain of molecular ge-
netics of oncology, mostly selected from the Pub-
MEd subset selected for the PennBioNE project
(Mandel, 2006). Of course, the BioLiterate archi-
tecture in general is not restricted to any particular
type or subdomain of texts.
The system is composed of a series of compo-

1 It is worth noting that inference which appear conceptually to be “straight-
forward deductions” often manifest themselves within BioLiterate as PLN
inference chains with 1-2 dozen inferences. This is mostly because of the rela-
tively complex way in which logical relationships emerge from semantic map-
ping, and also because of the need for inferences that explicitly incorporate
“obvious” background knowledge.

Each component, excluding the semantic map-
per and probabilistic reasoner, is realized as a
UIMA (Gštz and Suhre, 2004) annotator, with in-
formation being accumulated in each document as
each phase occurs.2
The gene/protein and malignancy taggers collec-
tively constitute our “entity extraction” subsystem.
Our entity extraction subsystem and the tokenizer
were adapted from PennBioTagger (McDonald et
al, 2005; Jin et al, 2005; Lerman et al, 2006). The
tokenizer uses a maximum entropy model trained
upon biomedical texts, mostly in the oncology do-
main. Both the protein and malignancy taggers
were built using conditional random fields.
The nominalization tagger detects nominaliza-
tions that represent possible relationships that
would otherwise go unnoticed. For instance, in the
sentence excerpt “... intracellular signal transduc-
tion leading to transcriptional activation...” both
“transduction” and “activation” are tagged. The
nominalization tagger uses a set of rules based on
word morphology and immediate context.
Before a sentence passes from these early proc-
essing stages into the dependency extractor, which
carries out syntax parsing, a substitution process is
carried out in which its tagged entities are replaced
with simple unique identifiers. This way, many
text features that often impact parser performance
are left out, such as entity names that have num-
bers or parenthesis as post-modifiers.
The dependency extractor component carries out
dependency grammar parsing via a customized
version of the open-source Sleator and Temperley
link parser (1993). The link parser outputs several
parses, and the dependencies of the best one are
taken.3
The relationship extractor component is com-
posed of a number of template matching algo-
rithms that act upon the link parser’s output to pro-
duce a semantic interpretation of the parse. This
component detects implied quantities, normalizes
passive and active forms into the same representa-

impact our results significantly.

tion and assigns tense and number to the sentence
parts. Another way of conceptualizing this compo-
nent is as a system that translates link parser de-
pendencies into a graph of semantic primitives
(Wierzbicka, 1996), using a natural semantic meta-
language (Goddard, 2002).
Table 1 below shows some of the primitive se-
mantic relationships used, and their associated link
parser links:

<bodyText confidence="0.968810869565217">
Both would lead to the extracted relationships:
subj(kiss, Kim), obj(kiss, Pat)
For a more interesting case consider:
c) Kim likes to laugh.
d) Kim likes laughing.
Both will have a to-do (like, laugh) seman-
tic relation.
Next, this semantic representation, together with
entity information, is feed into the Semantic Map-
per component, which applies a series of hand-
created rules whose purpose is to transform the
output of the Relationship Extractor into logical
relationships that are fully abstracted from their
syntactic origin and suitable for abstract inference.
The need for this additional layer may not be ap-
parent a priori, but arises from the fact that the
output of the Relationship Extractor is still in a
sense “too close to the syntax.” The rules used
within the Relationship Extractor are crisp rules
with little context-dependency, and could fairly
easily be built into a dependency parser (though
the link parser is not architected in such a way as
to make this pragmatically feasible); on the other

hand, the rules used in the Semantic Mapper are
often dependent upon semantic information about
the words being interrelated, and would be more
challenging to integrate into the parsing process.
As an example, the semantic mapping rule

maps the relationship by(prevention, inhi-
bition), which is output by the Relationship Ex-
tractor, into the relationship subj(prevention, inhi-
bition), which is an abstract conceptual relation-
ship suitable for semantic inference by PLN. It
performs this mapping because it has knowledge
that “prevention” inherits (Inh) from the semantic
category transitive_event, which lets it guess
what the appropriate sense of “by” might be.
Finally, the last stage in the BioLiterate pipeline
is probabilistic inference, which is carried out by
the Probabilistic Logic Networks4 (PLN) system
(Goertzel et al, in preparation) implemented within
the Novamente AI Engine integrated AI architec-
ture (Goertzel and Pennachin, 2005; Looks et al,
2004). PLN is a comprehensive uncertain infer-
ence framework that combines probabilistic and
heuristic truth value estimation formulas within a
knowledge representation framework capable of
expressing general logical information, and pos-
sesses flexible inference control heuristics includ-
ing forward-chaining, backward-chaining and rein-
forcement-learning-guided approaches.
Among the notable aspects of PLN is its use of
two-valued truth values: each PLN statement is
tagged with a truth value containing at least two
components, one a probability estimate and the
other a “weight of evidence” indicating the amount
of evidence that the probability estimate is based
on. PLN contains a number of different inference
rules, each of which maps a premise-set of a cer-
tain logical form into a conclusion of a certain
logical form, using an associated truth-value for-
mula to map the truth values of the premises into
the truth value of the conclusion.
The PLN component receives the logical rela-
tionships output by the semantic mapper, and per-
forms reasoning operations on them, with the aim
at arriving at new conclusions implicit in the set of
relationships fed to it. Some of these conclusions
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.402401">
4 Previously named Probabilistic Term Logic
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999885322580645">
may be implicit in a single text fed into the system;
others may emerge from the combination of multi-
ple texts.
In some cases the derivation of useful conclu-
sions from the semantic relationships fed to PLN
requires “background knowledge” relationships not
contained in the input texts. Some of these back-
ground knowledge relationships represent specific
biological or medical knowledge, and others repre-
sent generic “commonsense knowledge.” The
more background knowledge is fed into PLN, the
broader the scope of inferences it can draw.
One of the major unknowns regarding the cur-
rent approach is how much background knowledge
will need to be supplied to the system in order to
enable truly impressive performance across the full
range of biomedical research abstracts. There are
multiple approaches to getting this knowledge into
the system, including hand-coding (the approach
we have taken in our BioLiterate work so far) and
automated extraction of relationships from relevant
texts beyond research abstracts, such as databases,
ontologies and textbooks. While this is an ex-
tremely challenging problem, we feel that due to
the relatively delimited nature of the domain, the
knowledge engineering issues faced here are far
less severe than those confronting projects such as
Cyc (Lenat, 1986; Guha, 1990; Guha, 1994) and
SUMO (Niles, 2001) which seek to encode com-
monsense knowledge in a broader, non-domain-
specific way.

We have not yet conducted a rigorous statistical
evaluation of the performance of the BioLiterate
system. This is part of our research plan, but will

explored BioLiterate’s performance anecdotally

abstracts. This section presents one such example

with probability .8, and that its confidence that this
probability assessment is roughly correct is .07.

given the speculative nature of the inference. Note
that this is far higher than the confidence that
would be attached to a randomly generated rela-
tionship, however.

4 Discussion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999988642857143">
We have described a prototype bioNLP system,
BioLiterate, aimed at demonstrating the viability of
using probabilistic inference to draw conclusions
based on logical relationships extracted from mul-
tiple biomedical research abstracts using NLP
technology. The preliminary results we have ob-
tained via applying BioLiterate in the domain of
the genetics of oncology suggest that the approach
is potentially viable for the extraction of hypotheti-
cal interactions between genes, proteins and ma-
lignancies from sets of sentences spanning multiple
abstracts. One of our foci in future research will
be the rigorous validation of the performance of
the BioLiterate system in this domain, via con-
struction of an appropriate evaluation corpus.
In our work with BioLiterate so far, we have
identified a number of examples where PLN is able
to draw biological conclusions by combining sim-
ple semantic relationships extracted from different
biological research abstracts. Above we reviewed
one of these examples. This sort of application is
particularly interesting because it involves soft-
ware potentially creating relationships that may not
have been explicitly known by any human, because
they existed only implicitly in the connections be-
tween many different human-written documents.
In this sense, the BioLiterate approach blurs the
boundary between NLP information extraction and
automated scientific discovery.
Finally, by experimenting with the BioLiterate
prototype we have come to some empirical conclu-
sions regarding the difficulty of several parts of the
pipeline. First, entity extraction remains a chal-
lenge, but not a prohibitively difficult one. Our
system definitely missed some important relation-
ships because of imperfect entity extraction but
this was not the most problematic component.
Sentence parsing was a more serious issue for
BioLiterate performance. The link parser in its
pure form had very severe shortcomings, but we
were able to introduce enough small modifications
to obtain adequate performance. Substituting un-
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999971925">
common and multi-word entity names with simple
noun identifiers (a suggestion we drew from Pyy-
salo, 2004) reduced the error rate significantly, via
bypassing problems related to wrong guessing of
unknown words, improper handling of parentheses,
and excessive possible-parse production. Other
improvements we may incorporate in future in-
clude augmenting the parser’s dictionary to include
biomedical terms (Slozovits, 2003), pre-processing
so as to split long and complex sentences into
shorter, simpler ones (Ding et al, 2003), modifying
the grammar to handle with unknown constructs,
and changing the link parser’s ranking system (Py-
ysalo, 2004).
The inferences involved in our BioLiterate work
so far have been relatively straightforward for PLN
once the premises have been created. More com-
plex inferences may certainly be drawn in the bio-
medical domain, but the weak link inference-wise
seems to be the provision of inference with the ap-
propriate premises, rather than the inference proc-
ess itself.
The most challenging aspects of the work in-
volved semantic mapping and the supplying of
relevant background knowledge. The creation of
appropriate semantic mapping rules can be subtle
because these rules sometimes rely on the semantic
categories of the words involved in the relation-
ships they transform. The execution of even com-
monsensically simple biomedical inferences often
requires the combination of abstract and concrete
background knowledge. These are areas we will
focus on in our future work, as achieving a scalable
approach will be critical in transforming the cur-
rent BioLiterate prototype into a production-
quality system capable of assisting biomedical re-
searchers to find appropriate information, and of
drawing original and interesting conclusions by
combining pieces of information scattered across
the research literature.

<abstract confidence="0.992181821782178">and Temperley, 1992). The BioLiterate system is quite general in applicability, but in our work so far we have focused on the specific task of extracting relationships regarding interactions between genes, proteins and malignancies contained in, or implicit among multiple, biomedical research abstracts. This application is critical because the extraction of protein/gene/disease relationships from text is necessary for the discovery of metabolic pathways and non-trivial disease causal chains, among other applications (N6dellec, 2005; Davulcu, 2005, Ahmed, 2005). Systems extracting these sorts of relationships from text have been developed using a variety of technologies, including support vector machines (Donaldson et al, 2003), maximum entropy models and graph algorithms (McDonald, 2005), Markov models and first order logic (Riedel, 2005) and finite state automata (Hakenberg, 2005). However, these systems are limited in the relationships that they can extract. Most of them focus on relationships described in single sentences. The results we report here support the hypothesis that the methods embodied in BioLiterate, when developed beyond the prototype level and implemented in a scalable way, may be significantly more powerful, particularly in the extraction of relationships whose textual description exists in multiple sentences or multiple documents. Overall, the extraction of both entities and single-sentence-embodied inter-entity relationships has proved far more difficult in the biomedical domain than in other domains such as newspaper text (N6dellec, 2005; Jing et al, 2003; Pyysalo, 2004). One reason for this is the lack of resources, such as large tagged corpora, to allow statistical NLP systems to perform as well as in the news domain. Another is that biomedical text has many features that are quite uncommon or even nonexistent in newspaper text (Pyysalo, 2004), such as post-modifiers of nouns entity names is solely exhyphenated verbs cross-links nominalizations, and uncommon usage of paexpression of While recognizing the critical importance of overcoming these issues more fully, we have not addressed them in any novel way in the context of our work on BioLiterate, but have rather chosen to focus attention on the other end of the pipeline: using inference to piece together relationships extracted from separate sentences, to construct new relationships implicit among multiple sentences or documents. The BioLiterate system incorporates three main components: an NLP system that outputs entities, dependencies and basic semantic relations; a probabilistic reasoning system (PLN = Probabilistic Logic Networks); and a collection of hand-built semantic mapping rules used to mediate between the two prior components. One of the hypotheses underlying our work is that the use of probabilistic inference in a bioNLP context may allow the capturing of relationships not covered by existing systems, particularly those that are implicit or spread among several abstracts. This application of BioLiterate is reminiscent of the Arrowsmith system (Smalheiser and Swanson, 1998), which is focused on creating novel biomedical discoveries via combining pieces of information from different research texts; however, Arrowsmith is oriented more toward guiding humans to make discoveries via well-directed literature search, rather than more fully automating the discovery process via unified NLP and inference. Our work with the BioLiterate prototype has tentatively validated this hypothesis via the production of interesting examples, e.g. of conceptually straightforward deductions combining premcontained in different research Our future research will focus on providing more systematic statistical validation of this hypothesis. 2 System Overview For the purpose of running initial experiments with the BioLiterate system, we restricted our attention to texts from the domain of molecular genetics of oncology, mostly selected from the Pub- MEd subset selected for the PennBioNE project (Mandel, 2006). Of course, the BioLiterate architecture in general is not restricted to any particular type or subdomain of texts. The system is composed of a series of compoarranged in a pipeline: Tokenizer is worth noting that inference which appear conceptually to be “straightforward deductions” often manifest themselves within BioLiterate as PLN inference chains with 1-2 dozen inferences. This is mostly because of the relatively complex way in which logical relationships emerge from semantic mapping, and also because of the need for inferences that explicitly incorporate “obvious” background knowledge. 105</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.983599900990099">Reasoning System. Each component, excluding the semantic mapper and probabilistic reasoner, is realized as a UIMA (Gštz and Suhre, 2004) annotator, with information being accumulated in each document as phase The gene/protein and malignancy taggers collectively constitute our “entity extraction” subsystem. Our entity extraction subsystem and the tokenizer were adapted from PennBioTagger (McDonald et al, 2005; Jin et al, 2005; Lerman et al, 2006). The tokenizer uses a maximum entropy model trained upon biomedical texts, mostly in the oncology domain. Both the protein and malignancy taggers were built using conditional random fields. The nominalization tagger detects nominalizations that represent possible relationships that would otherwise go unnoticed. For instance, in the sentence excerpt “... intracellular signal transduction leading to transcriptional activation...” both “transduction” and “activation” are tagged. The nominalization tagger uses a set of rules based on word morphology and immediate context. Before a sentence passes from these early processing stages into the dependency extractor, which carries out syntax parsing, a substitution process is carried out in which its tagged entities are replaced with simple unique identifiers. This way, many text features that often impact parser performance are left out, such as entity names that have numbers or parenthesis as post-modifiers. The dependency extractor component carries out dependency grammar parsing via a customized version of the open-source Sleator and Temperley link parser (1993). The link parser outputs several parses, and the dependencies of the best one are The relationship extractor component is composed of a number of template matching algorithms that act upon the link parser’s output to produce a semantic interpretation of the parse. This component detects implied quantities, normalizes and active forms into the same representasemantic mapper will be incorporated into the UIMA framework in a later revision of the software. have experimented with using other techniques for selecting dependencies, such as getting the most frequent ones, but variations in this aspect did not impact our results significantly. tion and assigns tense and number to the sentence parts. Another way of conceptualizing this component is as a system that translates link parser dependencies into a graph of semantic primitives (Wierzbicka, 1996), using a natural semantic metalanguage (Goddard, 2002). Table 1 below shows some of the primitive semantic relationships used, and their associated link parser links: subj Subject S, R, RS Obj Direct object O, Pv, B Obj-2 Indirect object O, B that Clausal Complement TH, C to-do Subject Raising Complement (do) I, TO, Pg Semantic Primitives and Link Parser Links For a concrete example, suppose we have the sentences: a) Kim kissed Pat. b) Pat was kissed by Kim. Both would lead to the extracted relationships: subj(kiss, Kim), obj(kiss, Pat) For a more interesting case consider: c) Kim likes to laugh. d) Kim likes laughing. will have a (like, laugh) semantic relation. Next, this semantic representation, together with entity information, is feed into the Semantic Mapper component, which applies a series of handcreated rules whose purpose is to transform the output of the Relationship Extractor into logical relationships that are fully abstracted from their syntactic origin and suitable for abstract inference. The need for this additional layer may not be apparent a priori, but arises from the fact that the output of the Relationship Extractor is still in a sense “too close to the syntax.” The rules used within the Relationship Extractor are crisp rules with little context-dependency, and could fairly easily be built into a dependency parser (though the link parser is not architected in such a way as to make this pragmatically feasible); on the other 106 hand, the rules used in the Semantic Mapper are often dependent upon semantic information about the words being interrelated, and would be more challenging to integrate into the parsing process. As an example, the semantic mapping rule &amp; Inh($X, transitive_event) subj ($X,$Y) the relationship inhiwhich is output by the Relationship Extractor, into the relationship subj(prevention, inhibition), which is an abstract conceptual relationship suitable for semantic inference by PLN. It performs this mapping because it has knowledge “prevention” inherits from the semantic which lets it guess what the appropriate sense of “by” might be. Finally, the last stage in the BioLiterate pipeline is probabilistic inference, which is carried out by Probabilistic Logic (PLN) system (Goertzel et al, in preparation) implemented within the Novamente AI Engine integrated AI architecture (Goertzel and Pennachin, 2005; Looks et al, 2004). PLN is a comprehensive uncertain inference framework that combines probabilistic and heuristic truth value estimation formulas within a knowledge representation framework capable of expressing general logical information, and possesses flexible inference control heuristics including forward-chaining, backward-chaining and reinforcement-learning-guided approaches. Among the notable aspects of PLN is its use of two-valued truth values: each PLN statement is tagged with a truth value containing at least two components, one a probability estimate and the other a “weight of evidence” indicating the amount of evidence that the probability estimate is based on. PLN contains a number of different inference rules, each of which maps a premise-set of a certain logical form into a conclusion of a certain logical form, using an associated truth-value formula to map the truth values of the premises into the truth value of the conclusion. The PLN component receives the logical relationships output by the semantic mapper, and performs reasoning operations on them, with the aim at arriving at new conclusions implicit in the set of relationships fed to it. Some of these conclusions named Probabilistic Term Logic may be implicit in a single text fed into the system; others may emerge from the combination of multiple texts. In some cases the derivation of useful conclusions from the semantic relationships fed to PLN requires “background knowledge” relationships not contained in the input texts. Some of these background knowledge relationships represent specific biological or medical knowledge, and others represent generic “commonsense knowledge.” The more background knowledge is fed into PLN, the broader the scope of inferences it can draw. One of the major unknowns regarding the current approach is how much background knowledge will need to be supplied to the system in order to enable truly impressive performance across the full range of biomedical research abstracts. There are multiple approaches to getting this knowledge into the system, including hand-coding (the approach we have taken in our BioLiterate work so far) and automated extraction of relationships from relevant texts beyond research abstracts, such as databases, ontologies and textbooks. While this is an extremely challenging problem, we feel that due to the relatively delimited nature of the domain, the knowledge engineering issues faced here are far less severe than those confronting projects such as Cyc (Lenat, 1986; Guha, 1990; Guha, 1994) and SUMO (Niles, 2001) which seek to encode commonsense knowledge in a broader, non-domainspecific way. 3 A Practical Example We have not yet conducted a rigorous statistical evaluation of the performance of the BioLiterate system. This is part of our research plan, but will involve considerable effort, due to the lack of any existing evaluation corpus for the tasks that Bio- Literate performs. For the time being, we have explored BioLiterate’s performance anecdotally via observing its behavior on various example “inference problems” implicit in groups of biomedical abstracts. This section presents one such example in moderate detail (full detail being infeasible due to space limitations). Table 2 shows two sentences drawn from different PubMed abstracts, and then shows the conclusions that BioLiterate draws from the combination of these two sentences. The table shows the conclusions in natural language format, but the system 107 actually outputs conclusions in logical relationship form as detailed below.

Table 4 shows a detailed “inference trail” constituting part of the reasoning done by PLN to draw the inference “DLC prevents bone loss” from these extracted semantic relationships, invoking background knowledge from its knowledge base as appropriate. The notation used in Table 4 is so that, for ininhib inhib synonymous with 1 2 denotes an Inheritance relationship between the terms inhibition and inhibition (the textual shorthands used in the 2 table are described in the caption). The logical relationships used are Inheritance, Implication, AND (conjunction) and Evaluation. Evaluation is the relation between a predicate and its arguments; subj(inhib , DLC) that the 2 holds when applied to the list (in- DLC) These particular logical relationships are reviewed in more depth in (Goertzel and Pennachin, 2005; Looks et al, 2004). Finally, indent notation is used to denote argument structure, so that e.g. R A B synonymous with PLN is an uncertain inference system, which means that each of the terms and relationships used as premises, conclusions or intermediaries in PLN inference come along with uncertain truth values. In this case the truth value of the conclusion at the end of Table 4 comes out to &lt;.8,.07&gt;, which indicates that the system guesses the conclusion is true with probability .8, and that its confidence that this probability assessment is roughly correct is .07. Confidence values are scaled between 0 and 1: .07 is a relatively low confidence, which is appropriate given the speculative nature of the inference. Note that this is far higher than the confidence that would be attached to a randomly generated relationship, however.

Relationships used in premises along the trail, but not produced as conclusions along the trail, were introduced into the trail via the system looking in its knowledge base to obtain the previously computed truth value of a relationship, which was found via prior knowledge or a prior inference trail. 4 Discussion We have described a prototype bioNLP system, BioLiterate, aimed at demonstrating the viability of using probabilistic inference to draw conclusions based on logical relationships extracted from multiple biomedical research abstracts using NLP technology. The preliminary results we have obtained via applying BioLiterate in the domain of the genetics of oncology suggest that the approach is potentially viable for the extraction of hypothetical interactions between genes, proteins and malignancies from sets of sentences spanning multiple abstracts. One of our foci in future research will be the rigorous validation of the performance of the BioLiterate system in this domain, via construction of an appropriate evaluation corpus. In our work with BioLiterate so far, we have identified a number of examples where PLN is able to draw biological conclusions by combining simple semantic relationships extracted from different biological research abstracts. Above we reviewed one of these examples. This sort of application is particularly interesting because it involves software potentially creating relationships that may not have been explicitly known by any human, because they existed only implicitly in the connections between many different human-written documents. In this sense, the BioLiterate approach blurs the boundary between NLP information extraction and automated scientific discovery. Finally, by experimenting with the BioLiterate prototype we have come to some empirical conclusions regarding the difficulty of several parts of the pipeline. First, entity extraction remains a challenge, but not a prohibitively difficult one. Our system definitely missed some important relationships because of imperfect entity extraction but this was not the most problematic component. Sentence parsing was a more serious issue for BioLiterate performance. The link parser in its pure form had very severe shortcomings, but we were able to introduce enough small modifications obtain adequate performance. Substituting un- 109 common and multi-word entity names with simple noun identifiers (a suggestion we drew from Pyysalo, 2004) reduced the error rate significantly, via bypassing problems related to wrong guessing of unknown words, improper handling of parentheses, and excessive possible-parse production. Other improvements we may incorporate in future include augmenting the parser’s dictionary to include biomedical terms (Slozovits, 2003), pre-processing so as to split long and complex sentences into shorter, simpler ones (Ding et al, 2003), modifying the grammar to handle with unknown constructs, and changing the link parser’s ranking system (Pyysalo, 2004). The inferences involved in our BioLiterate work so far have been relatively straightforward for PLN once the premises have been created. More complex inferences may certainly be drawn in the biomedical domain, but the weak link inference-wise seems to be the provision of inference with the appropriate premises, rather than the inference process itself. The most challenging aspects of the work involved semantic mapping and the supplying of relevant background knowledge. The creation of appropriate semantic mapping rules can be subtle because these rules sometimes rely on the semantic categories of the words involved in the relationships they transform. The execution of even commonsensically simple biomedical inferences often requires the combination of abstract and concrete background knowledge. These are areas we will focus on in our future work, as achieving a scalable approach will be critical in transforming the current BioLiterate prototype into a productionquality system capable of assisting biomedical researchers to find appropriate information, and of drawing original and interesting conclusions by combining pieces of information scattered across the research literature.

This application is critical because the extraction of protein/gene/disease relationships from text is necessary for the discovery of metabolic pathways and non-trivial disease causal chains, among other applications (N6dellec, 2005; Davulcu, 2005, Ahmed, 2005). Systems extracting these sorts of relationships from text have been developed using a variety of technologies, including support vector machines (Donaldson et al, 2003), maximum entropy models and graph algorithms (McDonald, 2005), Markov models and first order logic (Riedel, 2005) and finite state automata (Hakenberg, 2005). However, these systems are limited in the relationships that they can extract. Most of them focus on relationships described in single sentences. The results we report here support the hypothesis that the methods embodied in BioLiterate, when developed beyond the prototype level and implemented in a scalable way, may be significantly more powerful, particularly in the extraction of relationships whose textual description exists in multiple sentences or multiple documents.

Of course, the BioLiterate architecture in general is not restricted to any particular type or subdomain of texts. The system is composed of a series of components arranged in a pipeline: Tokenizer 4Gene, 1 It is worth noting that inference which appear conceptually to be “straightforward deductions” often manifest themselves within BioLiterate as PLN inference chains with 1-2 dozen inferences.

Another is that biomedical text has many features that are quite uncommon or even nonexistent in newspaper text (Pyysalo, 2004), such as numerical post-modifiers of nouns (Serine 38), non-capitalized entity names (ÉftsY is solely expressed during...), hyphenated verbs (X cross-links Y), nominalizations, and uncommon usage of parentheses (sigma(H)-dependent expression of spo0A). While recognizing the critical importance of overcoming these issu</context>

First, entity extraction remains a challenge, but not a prohibitively difficult one. Our system definitely missed some important relationships because of imperfect entity extraction but this was not the most problematic component. Sentence parsing was a more serious issue for BioLiterate performance. The link parser in its pure form had very severe shortcomings, but we were able to introduce enough small modifications to obtain adequate performance. Substituting un109 common and multi-word entity names with simple noun identifiers (a suggestion we drew from Pyysalo, 2004) reduced the error rate significantly, via bypassing problems related to wrong guessing of unknown words, improper handling of parentheses, and excessive possible-parse production. Other improvements we may incorporate in future include augmenting the parser’s dictionary to include biomedical terms (Slozovits, 2003), pre-processing so as to split long and complex sentences into shorter, simpler ones (Ding et al, 2003), modifying the grammar to handle with unknown constructs, and changing the link parser’s ranking system (Pyysalo, 2004).

This application is critical because the extraction of protein/gene/disease relationships from text is necessary for the discovery of metabolic pathways and non-trivial disease causal chains, among other applications (N6dellec, 2005; Davulcu, 2005, Ahmed, 2005). Systems extracting these sorts of relationships from text have been developed using a variety of technologies, including support vector machines (Donaldson et al, 2003), maximum entropy models and graph algorithms (McDonald, 2005), Markov models and first order logic (Riedel, 2005) and finite state automata (Hakenberg, 2005). However, these systems are limited in the relationships that they can extract. Most of them focus on relationships described in single sentences. The results we report here support the hypothesis that the methods embodied in BioLiterate, when developed beyond the prototype level and implemented in a scalable way, may be significantly more powerful, particularly in the extraction of relationships whose textual description exists in multiple sentences or multiple documents.

One of the hypotheses underlying our work is that the use of probabilistic inference in a bioNLP context may allow the capturing of relationships not covered by existing systems, particularly those that are implicit or spread among several abstracts. This application of BioLiterate is reminiscent of the Arrowsmith system (Smalheiser and Swanson, 1998), which is focused on creating novel biomedical discoveries via combining pieces of information from different research texts; however, Arrowsmith is oriented more toward guiding humans to make discoveries via well-directed literature search, rather than more fully automating the discovery process via unified NLP and inference. Our work with the BioLiterate prototype has tentatively validated this hypothesis via the production of interesting examples, e.g. of conceptually straightforward deductions combining premises contained in different research papers.1 Our future research will focus on pr</context>
