ABSTRACT

<bodyText confidence="0.999909615384615">
Two well-known phenomena in the area
of pronoun binding are considered:
Indirect binding of pronouns by indefinite
NPs (&amp;quot;donkey sentences&amp;quot;) and surface-
syntactic constraints on binding (&amp;quot;weak
cross-over&amp;quot;). A common treatment is
proposed, and general consequences for
the relation between syntactic and
semantic processing are discussed. It is
argued that syntactic and semantic
analysis must interact in a complex way,
rather than in a simple sequential or strict
rule-to-rule fashion.

Taken that the &amp;quot;scope of a NP&amp;quot; means the
scope of the (generalized) quantifier the
NP translates to, and that pronouns are
semantically represented by individual
variables, Binding principle (1) more or
less directly corresponds to the conditions
on variable binding in predicate logic,
and therefore has a great deal of intuitive
plausibility with it. Accordingly, it is
explicitly or silently assumed as the basic
principle for pronoun binding in many
theoretical and computational approaches
to the semantics of natural language.
Principle (1) makes correct predictions
for a wide range of natural language ex-
amples (we disregard the distinction bet-
ween reflexive and non-reflexive pro-
nouns throughout this paper). E.g., it ex-
plains why sentence (2) is fine, whereas
(3) is impossible (binding is indicated in
the usual way by co-indexing).

This is the well-known &amp;quot;donkey-sentence
problem&amp;quot; which motivated the DRT-style
reformulation of natural language
semantics (Discourse Representation
Theory: Kamp 1981; File Change Se-
mantics: Heim 1982). The solution that
DRT provides for the donkey sentence
- 45 -
problem can be roughly outlined as
follows: The common semantic function
of non-anaphorical noun phrases is the
introduction of a new discourse referent,
which is in turn available for the binding
of anaphoric expressions. Beyond this
basic function, non-anaphorical noun
phrases subdivide into genuine quanti-
fiers (e.g., every professor), and non-
quantificational NPs (e.g., the indefinite
NP a book). Only the former bear scope.
An every-NP, e.g., triggers the intro-
duction of a complex condition of the form
K1 K2, where K1 and K2 are sub-DRSes
representing the restriction and the scope
of the quantification respectively. In-
definite NPs just contribute a new
discourse referent (together with some
descriptive material in terms of con-
ditions on the discourse referent), which is
placed in a larger structure. This larger
structure can be the top-level DRS or some
sub-DRS according to the sentence-inter-
nal environment of the analyzed NP.
Indefinite NPs do not have scope by
themselves. It follows that Principle (1)
cannot apply to Sentence (4), if it is taken
literally. However, the model-theoretic
interpretation for complex conditions is
defined in a way that indefinite NPs
share quantificational force and scope
with their &amp;quot;host quantifier&amp;quot; (i.e., the
quantificational NP whose representation
contains the discourse referent introduced
by the indefinite on the top-level of its
restriction part). Accordingly, an inde-
finite NP should observe the restrictions
on binding imposed by that larger
quantificational structure. Therefore, the
original binding principle (1) must be
replaced by something like (5).

permits binding in (4), whereas the

Standard DRT tries to give a general
account for the constraints on anaphoric
binding by specifying an accessibility
relation between positions in a complex
DRS. The formulation of the revised
binding principle in (5) is obviously
neither general nor precise enough to
replace the standard DRT treatment. We
will come back to the point in Section 4.

Expressed in terms of conventional
predicate logic or generalized quantifier
theory, Sentence (7) is ambiguous between
a narrow-scope reading and a wide-scope
reading of the existential NP a book. The
former corresponds to the constituent
structure of (7), the latter is due to a
&amp;quot;delayed application&amp;quot; of the existential
NP, which can be brought about by
different syntactic and semantic
techniques (e.g., Quantifier Raising:
May 1985, Cooper Storage: Cooper 1983).
Scope variation leads to an additional
difficulty with the binding principle (1): If
NPs (i.e., quantifier terms, on the
standard account) are applied in situ,
their semantic scope precisely parallels
their c-command domain in surface
structure. Examples of postponed
quantifier application disturb the
parallelism and by that provide evidence
that the syntactic c-command concept is
relevant for binding in addition to the
semantic notion of scope.

In Sentence (8), every teacher may take
scope over the indefinite NP a student of
his. That the pronoun his is in the scope of
- 46 -
the quantifier is obviously insufficient to
license binding, which seems to be
blocked by the fact that the object NP does
not c-command the pronoun. This pheno-
tnenon, the so-called &amp;quot;Weak-Crossover
Effect&amp;quot;, shows that the semantic principle
(1) is too weak to properly constrain ana-
phoric binding, and has lead to a syntactic
binding principle the classical formu-
lation of which is given in (9) (cf. Rein-
hart 1983, Williams 1986).
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.710816">
(9) A NP can bind pronouns in its c-
command domain.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999781272727273">
As more recent theoretical work has
shown, the c-command condition is only
an approximation to reality (cf. Stowell
1989). However, the precise definition of
the c-command relation and the syntactic
condition as a whole is not crucial for the
argument. The important point is that
anaphoric binding is apparently
dependent on genuinely syntactic facts:
The decision of whether a pronoun can be
bound by a NP cannot be made on the basis
of semantic information only. There are
basically two possible ways out: On the
one hand, one can pass the task of
specifying anaphoric relations completely
to syntax (this is the answer of GB
grammarians). On the other hand, one
can make certain portions of syntactic
information available for semantic
processing (proposals are made in Pol-
lack/Pereira 1988, Latecki/Pinkal 1990).
The choice between the two solutions
seems to some extent to be a matter of taste:
Plausibility reasons as well as efficiency
considerations for natural language pro-
cessing speak against the first solution.
The fact that one has to import and process
syntactic information within semantic
interpretation seems to be a certain
methodological drawback. I will come
back to the question after having dis-
cussed a further complication in the next
section.
scope ambiguity and its consequences for
anaphoric binding have been considered
on the background of the standard
semantic framework. Obviously, a two-
reading analysis for sentences like (7)
must be provided in a DRT-based
analysis, as well, although it must be
accounted for in a slightly different way.
The two readings of (7) do not differ in the
relative scope order of two quantifiers.
Rather, the difference is that on the
narrow scope reading, the discourse
referent introduced by a book occurs
inside the complex condition established
by the universal NP (its host quantifier),
whereas on the wide-scope reading it
occurs on the top-level of the DRS.
Scope ambiguities are not treated in the
original DRT version; they are difficult to
model with procedural DRS construction
rules that operate on surface syntactic
structures. There is however a convenient
and straightforward way to combine the
DRT formalism with the technical means
of lambda-abstraction. (10) indicates how
representations of the NPs every professor
and a book as partially instantiated
DRSes can be given using lambda-ab-
straction over predicative DRSes (The
latter are obtained from standard DRSes
by abstraction over a discourse referent.
The &amp;quot;s&amp;quot; sign in (10) is an operator which
merges two DRSes.)

One effect of this modification of DRT is
that semantic representations can be
constructed compositionally, in a bottom-
up fashion. Another consequence is that
- 47 -
the standard techniques for delayed
application become available in the DRT
framework.
Not surprisingly, we run into difficulties
with the revised semantic binding
condition (5) in connection with the weak
crossover cases, as soon as we treat scope
ambiguities in a DRT-style analysis.
According to (5), both the standard weak
crossover example (8) and the inverted
donkey sentence (11) should be acceptable.
(11) *Itsi readers admire every professor
who writes {NP a bookh
Since the discourse referent provided by a
book takes its place at the top level of the
restriction part of the every-NP, the in-
definite should count as a proper ante-
cedent for the pronoun on the reading
where the every-NP takes wide scope over
the whole sentence. If in addition the
syntactic binding principle (9) is
observed, cases like (8) and (11) are
correctly ruled out: Neither every teacher
in (8) nor a book in (11) c-command the
respective pronouns. But unfortunately,
also those cases of anaphoric binding are
blocked which provided the original moti-
vation for DRT, namely the donkey-sen-
tence cases discussed above. In sentence
(4), the antecedent NP a book definitely
does not c-command the pronoun it.
Examples like (8) and (11) demonstrate
that a syntactic condition on binding has
to be observed, also under a DRT-based
analysis. The considerations of the last
paragraph however show that this
syntactic condition cannot be c-command
between antecedent and pronoun. A modi-
fication of the syntactic binding principle
(9) appears to bring about the right
predictions: It is not the antecedent which
must c-command the pronoun, but the
quantificational NP, the host operator of
the antecedent&apos;s discourse referent. In (4),
the pronoun it is in the c-command
domain of the NP every professor who
owns a book, whereas in (8) and (11),
where binding is impossible, the uni-
versal NP does not c-command the pro-
noun.
In (12), a revised version of the syntactic
principle (9) is proposed.

<bodyText confidence="0.966186823529412">
The revised principles (5) and (12) to-
gether capture the complex conditions on
binding in donkey sentences. They are
not general enough, however, for they do
not say anything about the binding
conditions on indefinites which are not
associated to the restriction of a genuine
quantifier term. In the following, a more
dynamic formulation of the binding rule
is given, which has larger coverage and
contains the interaction of quantification
and indefinites in donkey sentences as a
special case.
We assume that the immediate effect of the
analysis of a pronoun is just the
introduction of a discourse referent, which
is also marked as a candidate for
binding. Each semantic representation
contains together with the DRS infor-
mation about the unbound pronominal
discourse referents. Binding can take
place whenever a NP denotation (quanti-
ficational or indefinite) is applied to a
predicative DRS, according to (13).
(13) When the denotation a of a noun
phrase A is applied to a predicative DRS
XuR, any top-level discourse referent of a
can bind an unbound pronominal dis-
course referent of H, provided that the
respective pronoun is in the c-command
domain of A.
Rule (13) also accounts for the different
status of (14) and (15), where (15) is ex-
cluded by the syntactic constraint.

5. A GENERAL RESULT FOR SYN-
TACTIC-SEMANTIC PROCESSING
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999978936170213">
The results of the last section have
consequences for the over-all view of
syntactic-semantic processing of natural-
language sentences containing anaphoric
pronouns. The revised binding principle
(12) relates the pronoun fi and its
antecedent a indirectly, by making refe-
rence to the quantifier term y which even-
tually contains the discourse referent of
the antecedent NP. Now, the relation
between the pronoun 13 and the host quanti-
fier y is a syntactic one, whereas the
relation between y and the antecedent a is
a semantic relation: Up to which position
in the DRS the discourse referent
eventually percolates will only turn out,
when the corresponding portion of
semantic analysis is done.
This means that the decision between the
two ways of specifying anaphoric rela-
tions which were mentioned at the end of
Section 3 is no longer a matter of taste:
The linguistic data force a choice in favor
of the second alternative.
The possible anaphoric relations in a
sentence cannot be specified by the
syntactic component only: Some amount
of semantic processing must precede the c-
command check (in order to know which
constituents are to be checked). And they
cannot be specified by the semantic
component only, since there are obviously
surface-syntactic constraints on binding.
Therefore the strict sequential model of
syntactic and semantic processing: co-
indexing in the syntactic component and
strictly deterministic semantic inter-
pretation, which is explicitly or implicitly
favored by adherents of the Government-
and-Binding approach, cannot be main-
tained (if we disregard the theoretically
possible, but highly non-deterministic
method of random indexing and semantic
filtering). Also, anaphora cannot be
treated as a matter of syntax-free se-
mantics. Syntax and semantics must
interact in a non-trivial way in order to

The described interaction between syntax
and semantics suggests a processing
model with independent, but freely inter-
acting modules in the spirit of principle-
based parsing. Actually, an implemen-
tation of a principle-based NL system with
a semantic module covering the pheno-
mena discussed in this paper in in
preparation. It will basically be an ex-
tension of the system described in Millies
(1990).
A more conventional system for DRT-
based syntactic-semantic analysis that
generates admissible scope readings has
been implemented in Quintus Prolog at
the University of Hamburg, in a DCG
style grammar system. A declarative
version of DRT is used, which bears
certain similarities to the one described in
Zeevat (1989). Semantic interpretation is
carried out in parallel to syntactic
analysis. Scope readings are produced
using a modified version of Cooper
Storage, which is equivalent in its results
to Nested Cooper Storage (Keller 1988) and
the Hobbs-Shieber-Algorithm (Hobbs/
Shieber 1987), but employs an efficient
indexing technique to check violations of
free variable constraint and syntactic
island constraints.
An extension of the system which checks
the admissibility of anaphoric relations is
under work at Saarbriicken University. c-
command is checked by another version
of the above-mentioned indexing tech-
nique (described in Latecki 1990) Rele-
vant syntactic information is imported
into semantics by attaching index sets to
term phrases in the storage; it is activated
at the time of the (delayed) application of
the quantifier term. The system for
treating quantifier scope as well as its
extension to anaphoric binding are
described in Latecki/Pinkal (1990).

The solution that DRT provides for the donkey sentence - 45 - problem can be roughly outlined as follows: The common semantic function of non-anaphorical noun phrases is the introduction of a new discourse referent, which is in turn available for the binding of anaphoric expressions. Beyond this basic function, non-anaphorical noun phrases subdivide into genuine quantifiers (e.g., every professor), and nonquantificational NPs (e.g., the indefinite NP a book). Only the former bear scope. An every-NP, e.g., triggers the introduction of a complex condition of </context>

A SYNTACTIC BINDING CONDITION The scope of noun phrases is not determined by their surface syntactic position. (7) Every professor owns a book Expressed in terms of conventional predicate logic or generalized quantifier theory, Sentence (7) is ambiguous between a narrow-scope reading and a wide-scope reading of the existential NP a book. The former corresponds to the constituent structure of (7), the latter is due to a &amp;quot;delayed application&amp;quot; of the existential NP, which can be brought about by different syntactic and semantic techniques (e.g., Quantifier Raising: May 1985, Cooper Storage: Cooper 1983). Scope variation leads to an additional difficulty with the binding principle (1): If NPs (i.e., quantifier terms, on the standard account) are applied in situ, their semantic scope precisely parallels their c-command domain in surface structure. Examples of postponed quantifier application disturb the parallelism and by that provide evidence that the syntactic c-command concept is relevant for binding in addition to the semantic notion of scope.

(8) *A student of hiss admires [NP every teacher]j In Sentence (8), every teacher may take scope over the indefinite NP a student of his. That the pronoun his is in the scope of - 46 - the quantifier is obviously insufficient to license binding, which seems to be blocked by the fact that the object NP does not c-command the pronoun. This phenotnenon, the so-called &amp;quot;Weak-Crossover Effect&amp;quot;, shows that the semantic principle (1) is too weak to properly constrain anaphoric binding, and has lead to a syntactic binding principle the classical formulation of which is given in (9) (cf. Reinhart 1983, Williams 1986). (9) A NP can bind pronouns in its ccommand domain. As more recent theoretical work has shown, the c-command condition is only an approximation to reality (cf. Stowell 1989). However, the precise definition of the c-command relation and the syntactic condition as a whole is not crucial for the argument. The important point is that anaphoric binding is apparently dependent on genuinely syntactic facts: The decision of whether a pronoun can be bound by a NP cannot be made on the basis of semantic information only. There are basically two possible ways out: On the one hand, one c</context>
