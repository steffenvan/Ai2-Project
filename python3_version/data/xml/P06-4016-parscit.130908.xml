<bodyText confidence="0.998886">
TwicPen is a terminology-assistance sys-
tem for readers of printed (ie. off-line)
material in foreign languages. It consists
of a hand-held scanner and sophisticated
parsing and translation software to provide
readers a limited number of translations
selected on the basis of a linguistic analy-
sis of the whole scanned text fragment (a
phrase, part of the sentence, etc.). The use
of a morphological and syntactic parser
makes it possible (i) to disambiguate to
a large extent the word selected by the
user (and hence to drastically reduce the
noise in the response), and (ii) to handle
expressions (compounds, collocations, id-
ioms), often a major source of difficulty
for non-native readers. The system exists
for the following language-pairs: English-
French, French-English, German-French
and Italian-French.

As a consequence of globalization, a large and in-
creasing number of people must cope with docu-
ments in a language other than their own. While
readers who do not know the language can find
help with machine translation services, people
who have a basic fluency in the language while
still experiencing some terminological difficulties
do not want a full translation but rather more spe-
cific help for an unknown term or an opaque ex-
pression. Such typical users are the huge crowd
of students and scientists around the world who
routinely browse documents in English on the In-
ternet or elsewhere. For on-line documents, a va-
riety of terminological tools are available, some
of them commercially, such as the ones provided
by Google (word translation services) or Babylon
Ltd. More advanced, research-oriented systems
based on computational linguistics technologies
have also been developed, such as GLOSSER-
RuG (Nerbonne et al, 1996, 1999), Compass
(Breidt et al., 1997) or TWiC (Wehrli, 2003,
2004).
Similar needs are less easy to satisfy when
it comes to more traditional documents such as
books and other printed material. Multilingual
scanning devices have been commercialized1, but
they lack the computational linguistic resources to
make them truly useful. The shortcomings of such
systems are particularly blatant with inflected lan-
guages, or with compound-rich languages such as
German, while the inadequate treatment of multi-
word expressions is obvious for all languages.
TwicPen has been designed to overcome these
shortcomings and intends to provide readers of
printed material with the same kind and quality of
terminological help as is available for on-line doc-
uments. For concreteness, we will take our typical
user to be a French-speaking reader with knowl-
edge of English and German reading printed ma-
terial, for instance a novel or a technical document,
in English or in German.
For such a user, German vocabulary is likely
to be a major source of difficulty due in part to
its opacity (for non-Germanic language speakers),
the richness of its inflection and, above all, the
number and the complexity of its compounds, as
exemplified in figure 1 below.2

This paper will describe the TwicPen system,
showing how an in-depth linguistic analysis of
the sentence in which a problematic word occurs
helps to provide a relevant answer to the reader.
We will show, in particular, that the advantage of
such an approach over a more traditional bilin-
gual terminology system is (i) to reduce the noise
with a better selection (disambiguation) of the
source word, (ii) to provide in-depth morpholog-
ical analysis and (iii) to handle multi-word ex-
pressions (compounds, collocations, idioms), even
when the terms of the expression are not adjacent.

2 Overview of TwicPen
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999982545454545">
The TwicPen system is a natural follow-up of
TWiC (Translation of Words in Context), (see
Wehrli, 2003, 2004), which is a system for on-
line terminological help based on a full linguistic
analysis of the source material. TwicPen uses a
very similar technology, but is available on per-
sonal computers (or even PDAs) and uses a hand-
held scanner to get the input material. In other
words, TwicPen consists of (i) a simple hand-held
scanner and (ii) parsing and translation software.
TwicPen functions as follows :
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.836985473684211">
• The user scans a fragment of text, which can
be as short as one word or as long as a whole
sentence or even a whole paragraph.
• The text appears in the user interface of the
TwicPen system and is immediately parsed
and tagged by the Fips parser described in the
next section.
• The user can either position the cursor on the
specific word for which help is requested, or
navigate word by word in the sentence.
• For each word, the system retrieves from the
tagged information the relevant lexeme and
consults a bilingual dictionary to get one or
several translations, which are then displayed
in the user interface.
Figure 1 shows the user interface. The input text
is the well-known German compound discussed
by Kay et al. (1994) reproduced in (1):

<bodyText confidence="0.718123833333333">

Such examples are not at all uncommon in Ger-
man, in particular in administrative or technical
documents.

3 The Fips parser
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999698833333333">
Fips is a robust multilingual parser which is based
on generative grammar concepts for its linguis-
tic component and object-oriented design for its
implementation. It uses a bottom-up parsing al-
gorithm with parallel treatment of alternatives, as
well as heuristics to rank alternatives (and cut their
numbers when necessary).
The syntactic structures built by Fips are all
of the same pattern, that is : [ XP L X R ],
where L stands for the possibly empty list of left
constituents, X for the (possibly empty) head of
the phrase and R for the (possibly empty) list
of right constituents. The possible values for X
are the usual part of speech Adverb, Adjective,
Noun, Determiner, Verb, Tense, Preposition,
Complementizer, Interjection.
The parser makes use of 3 fundamental mecha-
nisms : projection, merge and move.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.992896">
3.1 Projection
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99991025">
The projection mechanism assigns a fully devel-
oped structure to each incoming word, based on
their category and other inherent properties. Thus,
a common noun is directly projected to an NP
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.99632">

<bodyText confidence="0.999253">
structure, with the noun as its head, an adjective
to an AP structure, a preposition to a PP struc-
ture, and so on. We assume that pronouns and,
in some languages proper nouns, project to a DP
structure (as illustrated in (2a). Furthermore, the
occurrence of a tensed verb triggers a more elabo-
rate projection, since a whole TP-VP structure will
be assigned. For instance, in French, tensed verbs
occur in T position, as illustrated in (2b):
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.661135333333333">

b. [ mangesi [ VP ei ] ]
TP
</figure>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.993785">
3.2 Merge
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999932">
The merge mechanism combines two adjacent
constituents, A and B, either by attaching con-
stituent A as a left constituent of B, or by attach-
ing B as a right constituent of any active node of
A (an active node is one that can still accept sub-
constituents).
Merge operations are constrained by various,
mostly language-specific, conditions which can be
described by means of procedural rules. Those
rules are stated in a pseudo formalism which at-
tempts to be both intuitive for linguists and rela-
tively straightforward to code (for the time being,
this is done manually). The conditions take the
form of boolean functions, as described in (3) for
left attachments and in (4) for right attachments,
where a and b refer, respectively, to the first and to
the second constituent of a merge operation.
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.940146666666667">
(3) D + T
a.AgreeWith(b,{number,person})
a.IsArgumentOf(b,subject)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.993937">
Rule 3 states that a DP constituent (ie. a tra-
ditional noun phrase) can (left-)merge with a TP
constituent (ie. an inflected verb phrase con-
stituent) if (i) both constituents agree in number
and person and (ii) the DP constituent can be in-
terpreted as the subject of the TP constituent.
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.963473571428571">
(4)a. D + N
a.HasSelectionFeature(Ncomplement)
b.HasFeature(commonNoun)
a.AgreeWith(b,{number,gender})
b. V + D
a.HasFeature(mainVerb)
b.IsArgumentOf(a, directObject)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.981673454545455">
Rule (4a) states that a common noun can be
(right-)attached to a determiner phrase, under the
conditions (i) that the head of the DP bears the se-
lectional feature [+Ncomplement] (ie. the de-
terminer selects a noun), and (ii) the determiner
and the noun agree in gender and number. Finally,
rule (4b) allows the attachment of a DP as a right
subconstituent of a verb (i) if the verb is not an
auxiliary or modal (ie. it is a main verb) and (ii) if
the DP can be interpreted as a direct object argu-
ment of the verb.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99821">
3.3 Move
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999857">
Although the general architecture of surface struc-
tures results from the combination of projection
and merge operations, an additional mechanism is
necessary to handle so-called extraposed elements
and link them to empty constituents (noted e in the
structural representation below) in canonical posi-
tions, thereby creating a chain between the base
(canonical) position and the surface (extraposed)
position of the “moved” constituent as illustrated
in the following example:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.787614">

b. [ [ who]ididj [ TP [ DP you ] ej [ VP
CP DP
invite[ e]i ] ] ]
DP
</equation>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.988928" genericHeader="method">
4 Multi-word expressions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.989107">
Perhaps the most advanced feature of TwicPen is
its ability to handle multiword expressions (id-
ioms, collocations), including those in which the
elements of the expression are not immediately
adjacent to each other. Consider the French verb-
object collocation battre-record (break-record), il-
lustrated in (6a, b), as well as in the figure 3.
(6)a. Paul a battu le record national.
Paul broke the national record
b. L’ancien record de Bob Hayes a finalement
´et´e battu.
Bob Hayes’ old record was finally broken.
The collocation is relatively easy to identify in
(6a), where the verb and the direct object noun
are almost adjacent and occur in the expected or-
der. It is of course much harder to spot in the (6b)
sentence, where the order is reversed (due to pas-
sivization) and the distance between the two ele-
ments of the collocation is seven words. Never-
theless, as Figure 3 shows, TwicPen is capable of
identifying the collocation.
The screenshot given in Figure 3 shows that the
user selected the word battu, which is a form of

<bodyText confidence="0.982415625">
the transitive verb battre, as indicated in the base
form field of the user interface. This lexeme is
commonly translated into English as to beat, to
bang, to rattle, etc.. However, the collocation
field shows that battu in that sentence is part of
the collocation battre-record which is translated as
break-record.
The ability of TwicPen to handle expressions
comes from the quality of the linguistic analysis
provided by the multilingual Fips parser and of the
collocation knowledge base (Seretan et al., 2004).
A sample analysis is given in (7b), showing how
extraposed elements are connected with canoni-
cal empty positions, as assumed by generative lin-
guists.
(7)a. The record that John broke was old.

<equation confidence="0.8152784">
b. [ [ the [ recordz [ that� [ [

John ] [ VP broke [ DP e]Z ] ] ] ] ] [ VP was
[ old ] ] ]
AP
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999623666666667">
In this analysis, notice that the noun record is
coindexed with the relative pronoun that, which in
turn is coindexed with the empty direct object of
the verb broke. Given this antecedent-trace chain,
it is relatively easy for the system to identify the
verb-object collocation break-record.

5 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998">
Demand for terminological tools for readers of
material in a foreign language, either on-line or
off-line, is likely to increase with the development
of global, multilingual societies. The TwicPen
system presented in this paper has been developed
for readers of printed material. They scan the sen-
tence (or a fragment of it) containing a word that
they don’t understand and the system will display
(on their laptop) a short list of translations. We
have argued that the use of a linguistic parser in
such a system brings several major benefits for the
word translation task, such as (i) determining the
citation form of the word, (ii) drastically reduc-
ing word ambiguities, and (iii) identifying multi-
words expressions even when their constituents
are not adjacent to each other.
