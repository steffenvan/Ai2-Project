We show how the integration of an extended
lexicon model into the decoder can improve
translation performance. The model is based
on lexical triggers that capture long-distance
dependencies on the sentence level. The re-
sults are compared to variants of the model
that are applied in reranking of n-best lists.
We present how a combined application of
these models in search and rescoring gives
promising results. Experiments are reported

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999676392857143">
Phrase-based statistical machine translation has im-
proved significantly over the last decade. The avail-
ability of large amounts of parallel data and access to
open-source software allow for easy setup of trans-
lation systems with acceptable performance. Pub-
lic evaluations such as the NIST MT Eval or the
WMT Shared Task help to measure overall progress
within the community. Most of the groups use a
phrase-based decoder (e.g. Pharaoh or the more re-
cent Moses) based on a log-linear fusion of models
that enable the avid researcher to quickly incorpo-
rate additional features and investigate the effect of
additional knowledge sources to guide the search for
better translation hypotheses.
In this paper, we deal with an extended lexicon
model and its incorporation into a state-of-the-art
decoder. We compare the results of the integration
to a similar setup used within a rescoring frame-
work and show the benefits of integrating additional
models directly into the search process. As will
be shown, although a rescoring framework is suit-
able for obtaining quick trends of incorporating ad-
ditional models into a system, an alternative that in-
cludes the model in search should be preferred. The
integration does not only yield better performance,
we will also show the benefit of combining both ap-
proaches in order to boost translation quality even
more. The extended lexicon model which we apply
is motivated by a trigger-based approach (Hasan et
al., 2008). A standard lexicon modeling dependen-
cies of target and source words, i.e. p(e|f), is ex-
tended with a second trigger f&apos; on the source side,
resulting in p(e|f, f&apos;). This model allows for a more
fine-grained lexical choice of the target word de-
pending on the additional source word f&apos;. Since the
second trigger can move over the whole sentence,
we capture global (sentence-level) context that is not
modeled in local n-grams of the language model or
in bilingual phrase pairs that cover only a limited
amount of consecutive words.
Related work A similar approach has been tried
in the word-sense disambiguation (WSD) domain
where local but also across-sentence unigram collo-
cations of words are used to refine phrase pair selec-
tion dynamically by incorporating scores from the
WSD classifier (Chan et al., 2007). A maximum-
entropy based approach with different features of
surrounding words that are locally bound to a con-
text of three positions to the left and right is re-
ported in (Garcia-Varea et al., 2001). A logistic
regression-based word translation model is investi-
gated by Vickrey et al. (2005) but has not been eval-
uated on a machine translation task. Another WSD
approach incorporating context-dependent phrasal
translation lexicons is presented by Carpuat and Wu
(2007) and has been evaluated on several translation

2 Setup
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999688">
The main focus of this work investigates an extended
lexicon model in search and rescoring. The model
that we consider here and its integration in the de-
coder and setup for rescoring are presented in the
following sections.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.946419">
2.1 Extended lexicon model
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999728368421053">
The triplets of the extended lexicon model p(e|f, f&apos;)
are composed of two words in the source language
triggering one target word. In order to limit the over-
all number of triplets, we apply a training constraint
that reuses the word alignment information obtained
in the GIZA++ step. For source words f, we only
consider the ones that are aligned to a target word e
given the GIZA++ word alignment. The second trig-
ger f&apos; is allowed to move over the whole source sen-
tence, thus capturing long-distance effects that can
be observed in the training data:
where {aij} denotes the alignment matrix of the sen-
tence pair fJ1 and eI1 and the first sum goes over all
fj that are aligned to the current ei (expressed as
j ∈ {ai}). The factor Zi = J · |{ai} |normalizes
the double summation accordingly. Eq. 1 is used in
the iterative EM training on all sentence pairs of the
training data. Empty words are allowed on the trig-
gering part and low probability triplets are trimmed.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997712">
2.2 Decoding
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999944">
Regarding the search, we can apply this model di-
rectly when scoring bilingual phrase pairs. Given a
trained model for p(e|f, f&apos;), we compute the feature
score ht of a phrase pair (˜e, ˜f) as
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.979577333333333">
ht(˜e, ˜f, {˜aij}, fJ 1 ) =(2)
X− log X X p(˜ei |˜fj, fj&apos;) + X log Zi
i jEl˜ai} j&apos; i
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999991842105263">
where i moves over all target words in the phrase ˜e,
the sum over j selects the aligned source words ˜fj
given {˜aij}, the alignment matrix within the phrase
pair, and j&apos; incorporates the whole source sentence
fJ1 . Analogous to Eq. 1, Zi = J · |{˜ai} |denotes
the number of overall source words times the num-
ber of aligned source words to each ˜ei. In Eq. 2,
we take negative log-probabilities and normalize to
obtain the final score (representing costs) for the
given phrase pair. Note that in search, we can only
use this direction, p(e|f, f&apos;), since the whole source
sentence is available for triggering effects whereas
not all target words have been generated so far,
as it would be necessary for the reverse direction,
p(f|e, e&apos;). Due to data sparseness, we smooth the
model by using a floor value of 10−7 for unseen
events during decoding. Furthermore, an implicit
backoff to IBM1 exists if the second trigger is the
empty word, i.e. for events of the form p(e|f, ε).

2.3 Rescoring
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999391148148148">
In rescoring, we constrain the scoring of our hy-
potheses to a limited set of n-best translations that
are extracted from the word graph, a pruned com-
pact representation of the search space. The advan-
tage of n-best list rescoring is the full availability of
both source text and target translation, thus allow-
ing for the application of additional (possibly more
complex) models that are hard to implement directly
in search, such as e.g. syntactic models based on
parsers or huge LMs that would not fit in memory
during decoding. Since we are limiting ourselves to
a small extract of translation hypotheses, rescoring
models cannot outperform the same models if ap-
plied directly in search. One advantage though is
that we can apply the introduced trigger model also
in the other direction, i.e. using p(f|e, e&apos;), where two
target words trigger one source word. Generally, the
combination of two directions of a model yields fur-
ther improvements, so we investigated how this ad-
ditional direction helps in rescoring (cf. Section 3.1).
In our experiments, we use 10 000-best lists ex-
tracted from the word graphs. An initial setting uses
the baseline system, whereas a comparative setup in-
corporates the (e|f, f&apos;) direction of the trigger lexi-
con model in search and adds the reversed direction
in rescoring. Additionally, we use n-gram posteri-
ors, a sentence length model and two large language

<bodyText confidence="0.999942878787879">
The experiments are carried out with a GALE sys-
tem using the official development and test sets of
the GALE 2008 evaluation. The corpus statistics
are shown in Table 1. The triplet lexicon model was
trained on a subset of the overall data. We used 1.4M
sentence pairs with 32.3M running words on the En-
glish side. The vocabulary sizes were 76.5K for the
source and 241.7K for the target language. The final
lexicon contains roughly 62 million triplets.
The baseline system incorporates the standard
model setup used in phrase-based SMT which com-
bines phrase translation and word lexicon models
in both directions, a 5-gram language model, word
and phrase penalties, and two models for reorder-
ing (a standard distortion model and a discriminative
phrase orientation model). For a fair comparison, we
also added the related IBM model 1 p(elf) to the
baseline since it can be computed on the sentence-
level for this direction, target given source. This step
achieves +0.5% BLEU on the development set for
newswire but has no effect on test. As will be pre-
sented in the next section, the extension to another
trigger results in improvements over this baseline,
indicating that the extended triplet model is superior
to the standard IBM model 1. The feature weights
were optimized on separate development sets for
both newswire and web text.
We perform the following pipeline of experi-
ments: A first run generates word graphs using the
baseline models. From this word graph, we ex-
tract 10k-best lists and compare the performance to
a reranked version including the additional models.
In a second step, we add one of the trigger lexi-

3.1 Results
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999982">
Table 2 presents results that were obtained on the
test sets. All results are based on lowercase eval-
uations since the system is trained on lowercased
data in order to keep computational resources fea-
sible. For the newswire setting, the baseline is
32.5% BLEU and 59.4% TER. Rescoring with addi-
tional models not including triplets gives only slight
improvements. By adding the path-aligned triplet
model in both directions, we observe an improve-
ment of +0.7% BLEU and -0.8% TER. Using the
triplet model in source to target direction (e, f, f&apos;)
during the search process, we arrive at a similar
BLEU improvement of +0.6% without any rerank-
ing models. We add the other direction of the triplets
(f, e, e&apos;) (the one that can not be used directly in
search) and obtain 33.7% BLEU on the newswire
set. The overall cumulative improvements of triplets
in search and reranking are +0.9% BLEU and -0.9%
TER when compared to the rescored baseline not in-
corporating triplet models and +1.2%/-1.3% on the
decoder baseline, respectively.
For the web text setting, the baseline is consid-
erably lower at 25.8% BLEU and 64.0% TER (cf.
right part of Table 2). We observe an improvement
for the baseline reranking models, a large part of
which is due to the Google Web LM. Adding triplets
to search does not help significantly (+0.2%/-0.5%
BLEU/TER). This might be due to training the
triplet lexicon mainly on newswire data. Rerank-
ing without triplets performs similar to the baseline

experiment. Mixing in the (f, e, e&apos;) direction helps
again: The final score comes out at 27.2% BLEU
and 62.0% TER, the latter being significantly better
than the reranked baseline (-1.5% in TER).

3.2 Discussion

<bodyText confidence="0.999996944444444">
The results indicate that it is worth moving models
from rescoring to the search process. This is not
surprising (and probably well known in the com-
munity). Interestingly, the triplet model can im-
prove translation quality in addition to its related
IBM model 1 which was already part of the base-
line. It seems that the extension by a second trigger
helps to capture some language specific properties
for Chinese-English which go beyond local lexical
(word-to-word) dependencies. In Table 3, we show
an example of improved translation quality where a
triggering effect can be observed. Due to the topic of
the sentence, the phrase local employment was cho-
sen over own jobs. One of the top triplets in this con-
text is p(employment I .R-Ak- , ºt ), where .R-Ak-
is “employment” due to the path-aligned constraint
and ºt means “talent”. Note that the distance be-
tween these two triggers is five tokens.

4 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99468584375">
We presented the integration of an extended lexicon
model into the search process and compared it to a
variant which was used in reranking n-best lists. In
order to keep the overall number of triplets feasi-
ble, and thus memory footprints and training times
low, we chose a path-constrained triplet model that
restricts the first source trigger to the aligned target
word, whereas the second trigger can move along
the whole source sentence. The motivation was to
allow for a more fine-grained lexical choice of tar-
get words by looking at sentence-level context. The
overall improvements that can be accounted to the
triplets are up to +0.9% BLEU and -1.5% TER.
In the future, we plan to investigate more triplet
model variants and work on additional language
pairs such as French-English or German-English.
The reverse direction, p(f|e, e&apos;), is hard to imple-
ment outside of a reranking framework where the
full target hypotheses are already fully generated. It
might be worth looking at cross-lingual trigger mod-
els such as p(f|e, f&apos;) or constrained variants like

Related work A similar approach has been tried in the word-sense disambiguation (WSD) domain where local but also across-sentence unigram collocations of words are used to refine phrase pair selection dynamically by incorporating scores from the WSD classifier (Chan et al., 2007). A maximumentropy based approach with different features of surrounding words that are locally bound to a context of three positions to the left and right is reported in (Garcia-Varea et al., 2001).
