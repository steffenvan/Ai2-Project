according to this definition2. Each elementary
tree is constrained to have at least one terminal
at its frontier which serves as &apos;head&apos; (or &apos;anchor&apos;).
Sentences of a Tag language are derived from the
composition of an S-rooted initial tree with other
elementary trees by two operations: substitution
(the same operation used by context free
grammars) or adjunction, which is more
powerful.
Schabes, Abeille, Joshi 1988 show that context
free grammars cannot in general be lexiealized
(using substitution only as the combining
operation). They also show that Iexicalized
grammars are interesting from a computational
point of view since lexicalization simplifies
parsing techniques, because the parser uses only a
relevant subset of the entire grammar: in a first
stage, the parser selects a set of elementary
structures associated with the lexical items in the
input sentence, and in a second stage the
sentence is parsed with respect to this set. As
shown by Schabes, Joshi 1989, a parser&apos;s
performances are thus improved.
We show here that such lexicalization&apos; should be
extended to other components of the grammar as
well, thus challenging the usual distinction
between &apos;lexical&apos; and &apos;syntactic&apos; rules. Further
parsing simplification is therefore expected.

As has often been noticed, rules (or transitivity
alternations) such as passive, particle hopping,
middle, dative-shift ... are subject to lexical
idiosyncrasies. There are of course syntactic and
semantic constraints governing such phenomena,
but lexical ones seem to be at stake to.
If one considers double objects constructions,
passivation of the second NP is regularly ruled
out on syntactic grounds. Passivation of the first
NP, on the other hand is subject to lexical
restrictions as the example of &apos;cost&apos;, opposed to
&apos;envy or &apos;spare&apos;, shows:

<bodyText confidence="0.999019">
Taking examples from English and French idioms, this
paper shows that not only constituent structures rules but
also most syntactic rules (such as topicalizat ion, wh-question,
pronominalization ...) are subject to lexical constraints (on
top of syntactic, and possibly semantic, ones). We show that
such puzzling phenomena are naturally handled in a
lexicalized. formalism such as Tree Adjoining Grammar. The
extended domain of locality of TAGS also allows one to
lexicalize&apos; syntactic rules while defining them at the level of
constituent structures.

<bodyText confidence="0.972329428571429">
in most current linguistic theories the
information put in the lexicon has been increased
in both amount and complexity. Viewing
constituent structures as projected from the
lexicon for example avoids the often noted
redundancy between Phrase Structure rules and
subcategorization frames. Lexical constraints on
the well-formedness of linguistic outputs has also
simplified the previous transformational
machinery.
Collapsing phrase-structure rules into the
lexicon is the overt purpose of lexicalized&apos;
grammars as defined by Schabes, Abeille, Joshi
1988: a &apos;lexicalized&apos; grammar consists of a finite
set of elementary structures, each of which is
systematically associated with one (or more)
lexical item serving as &apos;head&apos;. These structures are
combined with one another with one or more
combining operation(s). These structures specify
extended domains of locality (as compared to
CFGs) over which lexical constraints can be
stated. The &apos;grammar&apos; consists of a lexicon where
each lexical item is associated with a finite
number of structures for which that item is the
&apos;head&apos;.
We here assume familiarity with Tree Adjoining
Grammars, which are naturally le:dcalized&apos;

its figurative reading (to concern) and
&apos;concerner&apos;, which is a true synonym in this
context, behave differently:
Cette affaire regarde Jean
* Jean est regard6 par cette affaire
Cette affaire concerne Jean
Jean est concern e par cette affaire (M. Gross
1975)
It also seems a lexical phenomenon that &amp;quot;change
but not &amp;quot;transform&amp;quot; allows for ergative alternation
in English:
The witch changed/transformed John into a wolf
John changed into a wolf
* John transformed into a wolf (G, Lakoff 1970)
To take another example, dative shift (or there-
insertion) is often thought of as applying to a
semantically restricted set of verbs (eg verbs of
communication or of change of possession, for
dative), but this does not predict the difference
between &apos;tell&apos; that allows for it, and &apos;announce&apos; or
&apos;explain&apos; which do not3:
John told his ideas to Mary
John told Mary his ideas
John explained his ideas to Mary
* John explained Mary his ideas
Lexicalist frameworks such as GPSG, which
handles such phenomena by metarules (defined
on &apos;lexical&apos; PS rules), or LFG, which defines them
at the f-structure level (ie between &apos;lexical forms&apos;)
could capture such restrictions. D. Flickinger
1987 handles them explicitly with a hierarchical
lexicon in HPSG, considering such rules to hold
between two word classes (verbs here) and to
apply by default unless they are explicitly blocked
in the lexicon.
But all these representations rely on a clear-cut
distinction between lexical and syntactic rules and
it is not clear how they could be extended to the
latter.

meaning of the sentence and are supposed to
apply regularly on syntactic structures, and
&apos;lexical&apos; rules that alter argument structure, may
change the meaning of the predicate and may
exhibit some lexical idiosyncrasies, usually
overlooks the fact that both are subject to lexical
constraints.
There has often been discussions about whether
certain rules, (eg passive or extraposition) should
be considered of one kind or the other. But it has
seldom been realized, to the best of our
knowledge, how often &apos;syntactic&apos; rules are
prevented to apply on what seems purely lexical
grounds5.
Our discussion crucially relies on idiomatic or
semi-idiomatic constructions. We believe that a
sizable grammar of natural language, as well as
any realistic natural language application, cannot
ignore them, since their frequency is quite high in
real texts (M. Gross 1989). We first present
examples of such lexical constraints on
topicalization, pronominalization and wh-
question for both English and French idioms. We
then show that similar constraints can be found in
non idiomatic sentences.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.994909">
2.1 Flexibility or idiomatic constructions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.897162038461538">
Idioms arc usually divided into two sets (eg J.
Bresnan 1982, T. Wasow et al. 1982): &apos;fixed&apos; ones
(not subject to any syntactic rule) and flexible
ones (presumably subject to all). However, there
is quite a continuum between both.
Let us take two French idioms usually considered
as &amp;quot;fixed&amp;quot;: &apos;casser la croftte&apos; (to have a bite) and
&apos;demander la lune&apos; (to ask for the impossible). It
is true that passivation or wh-question do not
apply to either. But pronominalization for the
former, cleft-extraction (eest que) for the latter
do6;
Paul a casse la croftte (Paul had a bite)
# Quelle croftte casse-t-il ?
# Cest une petite crofite gull a cass6e.
derivation rules as such or by constraints on the well-
fonnedness of output structures.
5 An interesting exception being Kaplan and Zaenen 1989&apos;s
proposal that wh-movement and topieMizat ion be
constrained at the f-structure level, ie by LFG&apos;s &apos;lexical
forms&apos;.
6 # marks that the sentence is not possible with the desired
idiomatic interpretation. There may be some variations
among speakers about acceptability judgements on such
sentences (and on some of the following ones). Such
variability is indeed a property of lexical phenomena.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.992362">

<bodyText confidence="0.907291216666667">
? Paul est en train de casser une petite croftte et
j&apos;en casserais bien une aussi. (Paul is having a
little bite, I wouldn&apos;t mind having one too)
Jeanne demande la lune
# Quelle lune demande-t-elle ?
C&apos;est la lune qu&apos;elle demande
# Jeanne demande in lune et Paule la demande
aussi. (Jeanne is asking for the moon and I&apos;m
asking for it too)
These idioms are thus not completely fixed (as
opposed to idioms such as &apos;casser sa pipe&apos; or &apos;kick
the bucket&apos;), and some grammatical function
must be assigned to their frozen NPs. But the
differences among them are somewhat
unexpected: &apos;casser la create&apos; (where the noun
can be modified and take several determiners)
does not allow for more rules than &apos;demander in
lune&apos; (where the frozen NP is completely fixed).
If one now takes an idiom usually considered as
flexible, %riser la glace&apos; (to break the ice), which
does passivize, we notice the same distribution as
with &apos;casser la crofite&apos;:
Paul a brisk la glace
# Quelle glace a-t-il brisee ?
# C&apos;est in glace qu&apos;il brise
?? Jean a brise la glace bier et c&apos;est a moi de in
briser aujourd&apos;hui. (Paul broke the ice yesterday
and I have to break it today)
Passive is allowed but not wh-question, nor
cleft extraction. It is difficult to dismiss such
phenomena as rare exceptions. Looking at
numerous idioms shows that one combination of
such rules is not more frequent than the other. It
is also difficult to find a clear semantic principle
at work here.
Similar restrictions seem to be at work in
English. If one takes some English idioms usually
considered as &apos;flexible&apos; (or even not idiomatic at
all): NPO give hell/the boot to NF1. The main
verb &apos;give&apos; seems to behave syntactically and
semantically as in non idiomatic constructions:
Dative shift applies and we have the regular
semantic alternation : NP1 get hell/the boot
(from NPO), with identical meaning. But it is not
the case that all expecte rules apply: passive is
blocked, pronominalization on the object too:
# Hell was given to Mary (by John)
# The boot was given to Mary (by John)
# Alice gave hell to Paul yesterday and she is
giving it to Oscar now.
# Oscar gave the boot to Mary, and he will give it
to Bob too.
Syntactic rules may also apply differently to
distinct &apos;flexible&apos; idioms. It is easy to fmd idioms
which do passivize but don&apos;t allow for
pronominalization or topicalization in the same
way.
They hit the bull&apos;s eye.
The bull&apos;s eye, they hit.
? John hit the bull&apos;s eye and Paul hit it too.
They buried the hatchet.
?? The hatchet, they buried.
# John buried the hatchet and Paul buried it/one
too.
For relativation also, there might be similar
differences:
The strings that Chris pulled helped hime get the
job (Wasow et al. 1982)
# The bull&apos;s eye that John hit helped him get the
job.
# The hatchet that he buried helped him get the
job.
Distinguishing between fixed and flexible idioms
is thus not sufficient. Because different rules
apply to them differently, without a clear
hierarchy (contrary to Fraser 1970), one should
distinguish as many different types of flexibility as
there are possible combinations of such rules.
Similarly, if one wants to follow T. Wasow et al.
1982 &apos;s suggestion that some kind of
compositional semantics should be held
responsible for the syntactic flexibility of idioms,
as many degrees of compositionality should be
defined as there are combinations of syntactic
properties. Direct encoding of the latter is thus
preferable, and such a semantic &apos;detour&apos; does not
seem to help.
This does not mean that no regularities could
be found for idioms&apos; syntax but that they have to
be investigated at a more lexical level.
2.2 Some lexical constraints on non idiomatic
constructions
Going back to non idiomatic constructions, it
seems that their syntactic properties may be
subject to similar lexical idiosyncrasies.
If one considers double objects constructions, It
seems a lexical phenomenon that wh-question on
the second NP is allowed with &apos;give&apos; or &apos;spare&apos;,
and not with &apos;envy&apos; or &apos;cost&apos;, and that
topicalization is allowed with &apos;spare&apos; only:
They envy John his new car
* What/ * Which car do they envy John?
294 * This brand new car, everyone envies John
Each elementary tree in a Tag is lexicalized in
the sense that it is headed by (at least) one lexical
item. The category of a word in the lexicon is the
name of the tree it selects. We only consider here
sentential trees for the sake of simplicity.
What lexical heads select is in fact a set of
such elementary trees called a &apos;Tree Family
(Abeille 1988, Abeille et aL 1990), each tree
corresponding to a certain constituent sructure
(initial trees for wh-questions, auxiliary trees for
relative clauses...). This is the level at which
syntactic generalizations can be stated, since each
elementary tree may bear specific constraints
independantly of any lexical items8. A Tree
Family consists in fact of all the constituent
structures trees which are possibly allowed for a
given predicate9.

If one now considers the first NP, topicalization
applies differently to:
Mary, the mistake cost a chance to win
? John, you have always envied his extraordinary
luck
John, the judge kindly spared the ordeal
In French, as noted by M. Gross 1969, properties
usually thought of as applying to all &apos;direct
objects&apos;(passivation, Que-question and Le-
cliticization) may apply in fact unpredictingly.
Although the objects of a verb like &apos;aimer&apos; (love)
take objects undergoing the three of them, the
object of &apos;valoirlbe worth) only allows for Que-
question and Le-cliticiization, that of &apos;crater&apos;
(cost) only for Que-question and that of &apos;passer&apos;
(spend (time)) only allows for Le-cliticization:
Ce livre vaut cents francs.
(This book is worth 100 francs)
Ce livre les vaut.
Que vaut ce livre?
Ce livre cote cent francs.
(This book costs 100 francs)

These differences are all the more surprising
that &apos;coke? and &apos;valoir&apos; are otherwise very close
verbs (same subcategorization frames, same
selectional restrictions).
Looking for some generalization principles with
which to predict such restrictions should be
pursued, but it seems that they will be of a lexical
kind.

8 Further subdividing these Tree Families, similarly to M.
Gross 1975&apos;s verb tables for French, and to D. Flickinger
1987&apos;s vxml classes for English, will help reduce the number
of features, and thus the amount of seemingly idiosyncratic
information, associated with each verb. However, as noted by
both authors, lexical idiosyncrasies will never be eliminated
altogether
-
9 Tree Family names (GOV, nOVnl...) are somewhat similar
to &apos;lexical forms&apos; in LG in the sense that they capture both
the predicate argument structure and the associated
grammatical functions (which we note by indicts 0 for
subject,1 for first object...). Notice that the Tree Family name
does not change when lexical rules apply.
10,1.marks a substitution node,0marks the head. We use hem
standard TAG trees for commodity of exposition, although
295 recent independent linguistic work sugsests to slightly modify
them, challenging for example the distinction between VP
and V levels (see Abeille, in preparation).
Each tree is identified by a Tree family name
associated to a feature bundle corresponding to
the rules it involves. For example, a2, a3 and a4
arc respectively markedll:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.998024333333333">
al (nOVnl) a2 (nOVnI)
passive=- passive = +
Wb-O=- Wh-1. -
Wb-1 = - Wh-0 = -
erg = -
a3 (nOVnl) a4 (nOVnl)
passive - passive = +
Wh-1 = - Wh-1 r-- +
erg= + Wh-O -
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.99553169047619">
A given tree can belong to several tree
families at the same time, which helps factorizing
the grammar in a parsing perspective. For
example, a3 can also be considered as belonging
to the nOV Family (for verbs with one NP
argument) with a different feature bundle :
passive = -; Wh-0= -. The lexical items heading the
tree constrains its interpretation, eg &apos;sleep&apos; will
interpret a3 as nOV, while &apos;bake&apos; or &apos;walk&apos;
interpret it as nOVnl.
Lexical constraints on syntactic and lexical
rules are handled by having the head select its
own subset of trees in its tree family.
For example, &apos;resemble&apos; selects only active
trees; &apos;rumored&apos; only passive ones, and &apos;love&apos;
select both12-.
[love],V : nOVnl [erg= -]
[resemble]V: nOVnl [passive = -; erg=
[rumoredl,V: nOVnl [passive = + ]
Idonatei,V; to,P : nOVPn1 [dative= -;erg= -]
lgive],V;to,P: nOVPnl [erg= -I
Ispare1,V:n0Vn112
These features work as follows: when nothing
is said about a feature, it means that the predicate
selects trees with the feature being plus of minus;
11 One might explicitly define matendes, or links between
such trees: a passive rule for example, changes the feature
passive of the tree and intervert the features bearing on NO
and NI. Work is being curretly done along this line with T.
Becker, Y. Schabes and K. Vijay Shanker.
12 We note with square the set of inflected forms of a
lexical item. For example, (eve] = Sive, gives, gave, elvie&amp;
given. Wc use a restriction principle to rule out erg= +
whenever passive= + (or dative= +), and vice vomit, so the
ergative feature does not have to appear in the lexicon for
&apos;rumored&apos;.
when a feature is marked plus, it means that only
trees with this feature plus are selected (ie that
the corresponding rule is &apos;forced&apos; to apply).
Such lexicalization&apos; of syntactic rules applies
similarly in idiomatic and non idiomatic
constructions.

Tags seem a natural framework to represent
structures which at the same time are
semantically non compositional and should be
assigned regular syntactic structures (Abeille and
Schabes 1989, 1990). Idioms are thus made fall
into the same grammar as non idiomatic
constructions. The only specificity of idioms is
that they are selected by a multicomponent head
(called &apos;anchor&apos;) and may select elementary trees
which are more extended than non idiomatic
constructions. Here are some examples of
elementary trees for &apos;kick the bucket&apos;, &apos;bury the

Idiomatic and non idiomatic elementary trees are
gathered into tree families according to the
same principles. Here are some examples of the
trees belonging to the Family of idioms with a
frozen object (nOVDN1):
Similarly, idioms bear syntactic features
constraining the elementary trees of the Tree
Family they select. In the nOVDN1 Tree Family,
for example, &apos;kick the bucket&apos; selects only al, and
the trees corresponding to wh-movernent
on NO &apos;bury the hatchet&apos; selects
also the trees for passive (and possibly
topicalization on Ni).
[bury],V;the,D;hatchet,N: nOVDN1 [Wh-N1 = -]
lkickj,V;the,D;bucket,N: nOVDN1 [passive=-;
Wb-N1 = -; Top-N1= -]
There are some idioms which exist only in the
passive form, or in the question form, and the
corresponding trees are directly selected. In
French, &amp;quot;8tre pris par le temps&amp;quot; (to be very busy)
lacks its active counterpart (* Le temps prend
Jean), and &amp;quot;Quelle mouche a piqué NP ?&amp;quot; (What&apos;s
eating NP ?) lacks its non interrogative

features explained above). 297

Notice that the tree familiy name tells not only
about the argument structure but also about the
head being multicomponent or not (all head
elements are noted with capital letter). Usually,
no part of a multicomponent head can be
omitted, and trees that are possible for this
argument structure but in which all head
elements could not be inserted will be ruled out.
For example, what-questions (noted Wh-i) are
generally disallowed with frozen nominaLs (and
thus not noted for each lexical entry), whereas
questions with wh-determiners (noted Wh-Ni)
are not:
John took a trip to Spain
# What did John take?
? Which trip to Spain did John take ? (Abefilt et
al. 1990)
In fact, as has been noted by M. Gross 1989
for French, Wh-Ni questions seem to be ruled out
when the determiner of the argument is
completely fixed, as the following contrasts show:
John spilled the/those beans
John buried the/itthis/#a hatchet
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.812898">
Which bean(s) did John spill?
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9789675">

the Tree family names will be different (with D
for frozen determiners, and d for not frozen
ones):
[spill],V; n0VdN1

The trees for the Wh-N questions will thus belong

It has been shown that takine idiomatic or semi-

using Lexicalized Tree Adjoining grammars. An

<abstract confidence="0.995844423076923">to this Each elementary tree is constrained to have at least one terminal at its frontier which serves as &apos;head&apos; (or &apos;anchor&apos;). Sentences of a Tag language are derived from the composition of an S-rooted initial tree with other elementary trees by two operations: substitution (the same operation used by context free grammars) or adjunction, which is more powerful. Schabes, Abeille, Joshi 1988 show that context free grammars cannot in general be lexiealized (using substitution only as the combining operation). They also show that Iexicalized grammars are interesting from a computational point of view since lexicalization simplifies parsing techniques, because the parser uses only a relevant subset of the entire grammar: in a first stage, the parser selects a set of elementary structures associated with the lexical items in the input sentence, and in a second stage the sentence is parsed with respect to this set. As shown by Schabes, Joshi 1989, a parser&apos;s performances are thus improved. We show here that such lexicalization&apos; should be extended to other components of the grammar as well, thus challenging the usual distinction between &apos;lexical&apos; and &apos;syntactic&apos; rules. Further parsing simplification is therefore expected. lexical As has often been noticed, rules (or transitivity alternations) such as passive, particle hopping, middle, dative-shift ... are subject to lexical idiosyncrasies. There are of course syntactic and semantic constraints governing such phenomena, but lexical ones seem to be at stake to. If one considers double objects constructions, passivation of the second NP is regularly ruled out on syntactic grounds. Passivation of the first NP, on the other hand is subject to lexical restrictions as the example of &apos;cost&apos;, opposed to &apos;envy or &apos;spare&apos;, shows: They envy John his new car. John is envied his new car. The mistake cost Mary a chance to win. ?* Mary was cost a chance to win. The judge kindly spared John the ordeal. John was kindly spared the ordeal. One might argue that such differences may be due to some semantic constraints, but even verbs with similar meaning may exhibit striking differences. For example, in French, &apos;regarder&apos; in 92 Calcgorial grammars are also lexicatized&apos;.</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.988238798434442">Taking examples from English and French idioms, this paper shows that not only constituent structures rules but also most syntactic rules (such as topicalizat ion, wh-question, pronominalization ...) are subject to lexical constraints (on top of syntactic, and possibly semantic, ones). We show that such puzzling phenomena are naturally handled in a formalism such as Tree Adjoining Grammar. The extended domain of locality of TAGS also allows one to lexicalize&apos; syntactic rules while defining them at the level of constituent structures. TO &apos;LEXICALIZED&apos; GRAMMARS 1.1 LexIcalizing Phrase Structure rules current linguistic theories the information put in the lexicon has been increased in both amount and complexity. Viewing constituent structures as projected from the lexicon for example avoids the often noted redundancy between Phrase Structure rules and subcategorization frames. Lexical constraints on the well-formedness of linguistic outputs has also simplified the previous transformational machinery. Collapsing phrase-structure rules into the lexicon is the overt purpose of lexicalized&apos; grammars as defined by Schabes, Abeille, Joshi 1988: a &apos;lexicalized&apos; grammar consists of a finite set of elementary structures, each of which is systematically associated with one (or more) lexical item serving as &apos;head&apos;. These structures are combined with one another with one or more combining operation(s). These structures specify extended domains of locality (as compared to CFGs) over which lexical constraints can be stated. The &apos;grammar&apos; consists of a lexicon where each lexical item is associated with a finite number of structures for which that item is the &apos;head&apos;. We here assume familiarity with Tree Adjoining Grammars, which are naturally le:dcalized&apos; * The author wants to thank Yves Schabes, Aravind Joshi, Maurice Gross, Sharon Cote and Tilman Becker for fruitful discussions, and Robert Giannasi and Beatrice Santorini for their help. its figurative reading (to concern) and &apos;concerner&apos;, which is a true synonym in this context, behave differently: Cette affaire regarde Jean * Jean est regard6 par cette affaire Cette affaire concerne Jean Jean est concern e par cette affaire (M. Gross 1975) It also seems a lexical phenomenon that &amp;quot;change but not &amp;quot;transform&amp;quot; allows for ergative alternation in English: The witch changed/transformed John into a wolf John changed into a wolf * John transformed into a wolf (G, Lakoff 1970) To take another example, dative shift (or thereinsertion) is often thought of as applying to a semantically restricted set of verbs (eg verbs of communication or of change of possession, for dative), but this does not predict the difference between &apos;tell&apos; that allows for it, and &apos;announce&apos; or which do John told his ideas to Mary John told Mary his ideas John explained his ideas to Mary * John explained Mary his ideas Lexicalist frameworks such as GPSG, which handles such phenomena by metarules (defined on &apos;lexical&apos; PS rules), or LFG, which defines them at the f-structure level (ie between &apos;lexical forms&apos;) could capture such restrictions. D. Flickinger 1987 handles them explicitly with a hierarchical lexicon in HPSG, considering such rules to hold two word classes (verbs to apply by default unless they are explicitly blocked in the lexicon. But all these representations rely on a clear-cut distinction between lexical and syntactic rules and it is not clear how they could be extended to the latter. 2 LEXICAL CONSTRAINTS ON SYNTACTIC RULES distinction between &apos;syntactic&apos; that do not usually change argument structure nor 3 To dismiss &apos;announce or &apos;explain&apos; on the mere basis of their latin origin would not do, since &apos;offer&apos;, which comes from latin as well, does exhibit dative shift. We use the term &apos;rule&apos; for conveniency. not matter for our purpose, whether these phenomena are captured by meaning of the sentence and are supposed to apply regularly on syntactic structures, and &apos;lexical&apos; rules that alter argument structure, may change the meaning of the predicate and may exhibit some lexical idiosyncrasies, usually overlooks the fact that both are subject to lexical constraints. There has often been discussions about whether certain rules, (eg passive or extraposition) should be considered of one kind or the other. But it has seldom been realized, to the best of our knowledge, how often &apos;syntactic&apos; rules are prevented to apply on what seems purely lexical grounds5. Our discussion crucially relies on idiomatic or semi-idiomatic constructions. We believe that a sizable grammar of natural language, as well as any realistic natural language application, cannot ignore them, since their frequency is quite high in real texts (M. Gross 1989). We first present examples of such lexical constraints on topicalization, pronominalization and whquestion for both English and French idioms. We then show that similar constraints can be found in non idiomatic sentences. 2.1 Flexibility or idiomatic constructions Idioms arc usually divided into two sets (eg J. Bresnan 1982, T. Wasow et al. 1982): &apos;fixed&apos; ones (not subject to any syntactic rule) and flexible ones (presumably subject to all). However, there is quite a continuum between both. Let us take two French idioms usually considered as &amp;quot;fixed&amp;quot;: &apos;casser la croftte&apos; (to have a bite) and &apos;demander la lune&apos; (to ask for the impossible). It is true that passivation or wh-question do not apply to either. But pronominalization for the former, cleft-extraction (eest que) for the latter Paul a casse la croftte (Paul had a bite) as such or by constraints on the wellfonnedness of output structures. An interesting exception being Kaplan and proposal that wh-movement and topieMizat ion be constrained at the f-structure level, ie by LFG&apos;s &apos;lexical forms&apos;. idiomatic interpretation. There may be some variations among speakers about acceptability judgements on such on some of the following ones). Such variability is indeed a property of lexical phenomena. 293 ? Paul est en train de casser une petite croftte et j&apos;en casserais bien une aussi. (Paul is having a little bite, I wouldn&apos;t mind having one too) Jeanne demande la lune C&apos;est la lune qu&apos;elle demande aussi. (Jeanne is asking for the moon and I&apos;m asking for it too) These idioms are thus not completely fixed (as opposed to idioms such as &apos;casser sa pipe&apos; or &apos;kick the bucket&apos;), and some grammatical function must be assigned to their frozen NPs. But the differences among them are somewhat unexpected: &apos;casser la create&apos; (where the noun can be modified and take several determiners) does not allow for more rules than &apos;demander in lune&apos; (where the frozen NP is completely fixed). If one now takes an idiom usually considered as flexible, %riser la glace&apos; (to break the ice), which does passivize, we notice the same distribution as with &apos;casser la crofite&apos;: Paul a brisk la glace ?? Jean a brise la glace bier et c&apos;est a moi de in briser aujourd&apos;hui. (Paul broke the ice yesterday and I have to break it today) Passive is allowed but not wh-question, nor cleft extraction. It is difficult to dismiss such phenomena as rare exceptions. Looking at numerous idioms shows that one combination of such rules is not more frequent than the other. It is also difficult to find a clear semantic principle at work here. Similar restrictions seem to be at work in English. If one takes some English idioms usually considered as &apos;flexible&apos; (or even not idiomatic at all): NPO give hell/the boot to NF1. The main verb &apos;give&apos; seems to behave syntactically and semantically as in non idiomatic constructions: Dative shift applies and we have the regular semantic alternation : NP1 get hell/the boot (from NPO), with identical meaning. But it is not the case that all expecte rules apply: passive is blocked, pronominalization on the object too: giving it to Oscar now. to Bob too. Syntactic rules may also apply differently to distinct &apos;flexible&apos; idioms. It is easy to fmd idioms which do passivize but don&apos;t allow for pronominalization or topicalization in the same way. They hit the bull&apos;s eye. The bull&apos;s eye, they hit. John hit the bull&apos;s Paul hit it too. They buried the hatchet. ?? The hatchet, they buried. too. For relativation also, there might be similar differences: The strings that Chris pulled helped hime get the job (Wasow et al. 1982) job. job. Distinguishing between fixed and flexible idioms is thus not sufficient. Because different rules apply to them differently, without a clear hierarchy (contrary to Fraser 1970), one should distinguish as many different types of flexibility as there are possible combinations of such rules. Similarly, if one wants to follow T. Wasow et al. 1982 &apos;s suggestion that some kind of compositional semantics should be held responsible for the syntactic flexibility of idioms, as many degrees of compositionality should be defined as there are combinations of syntactic properties. Direct encoding of the latter is thus preferable, and such a semantic &apos;detour&apos; does not seem to help. This does not mean that no regularities could be found for idioms&apos; syntax but that they have to be investigated at a more lexical level. 2.2 Some lexical constraints on non idiomatic constructions Going back to non idiomatic constructions, it seems that their syntactic properties may be subject to similar lexical idiosyncrasies. If one considers double objects constructions, It seems a lexical phenomenon that wh-question on the second NP is allowed with &apos;give&apos; or &apos;spare&apos;, and not with &apos;envy&apos; or &apos;cost&apos;, and that topicalization is allowed with &apos;spare&apos; only: They envy John his new car * What/ * Which car do they envy John? * brand new car, everyone envies John elementary tree in a Tag is lexicalized the sense that it is headed by (at least) one lexical item. The category of a word in the lexicon is the of the selects. We only consider here sentential trees for the sake of simplicity. lexical heads in fact a set of such elementary trees called a &apos;Tree Family (Abeille 1988, Abeille et aL 1990), each tree corresponding to a certain constituent sructure (initial trees for wh-questions, auxiliary trees for relative clauses...). This is the level at which syntactic generalizations can be stated, since each elementary tree may bear specific constraints of any lexical A Tree in fact of all the constituent structures trees which are possibly allowed for a Examples of trees in the nOVn1 Family (verbs taking two NP arguments) are the following10: A a, A VP V A 0, N The mistake cast Mary a chance to win ▪ What/ *Which chance did the mistake cost Mary? * This unique chance, the mistake cast Mary The judge spared John the ordeal What / Which ordeal did the judge spare John? This ordeal, the judge kindly spared John If one now considers the first NP, topicalization applies differently to: Mary, the mistake cost a chance to win ? John, you have always envied his extraordinary luck John, the judge kindly spared the ordeal In French, as noted by M. Gross 1969, properties usually thought of as applying to all &apos;direct objects&apos;(passivation, Que-question and Lecliticization) may apply in fact unpredictingly. Although the objects of a verb like &apos;aimer&apos; (love) take objects undergoing the three of them, the object of &apos;valoirlbe worth) only allows for Quequestion and Le-cliticiization, that of &apos;crater&apos; (cost) only for Que-question and that of &apos;passer&apos; (spend (time)) only allows for Le-cliticization: Ce livre vaut cents francs. (This book is worth 100 francs) Ce livre les vaut. Que vaut ce livre? Ce livre cote cent francs. (This book costs 100 francs) • Ce livre les cote. coute passe la nuit a travailler. (He spent the night working) passee a travailler. Qu&apos; a-t-il passe a travailler These differences are all the more surprising that &apos;coke? and &apos;valoir&apos; are otherwise very close verbs (same subcategorization frames, same selectional restrictions). Looking for some generalization principles with which to predict such restrictions should be pursued, but it seems that they will be of a lexical kind. 3 LEXICALIZED RULES IN A TREE ADJOINING GRAMMAR 3.1 Tree Families ? Quelle nuit a-t-il passee I ? be better. 8 Further subdividing these Tree Families, similarly to M. Gross 1975&apos;s verb tables for French, and to D. Flickinger 1987&apos;s vxml classes for English, will help reduce the number of features, and thus the amount of seemingly idiosyncratic associated with However, as noted by both authors, lexical idiosyncrasies will never be eliminated altogether - 9 Tree Family names (GOV, nOVnl...) are somewhat similar &apos;lexical forms&apos; in in the sense they capture both the predicate argument structure and the associated grammatical functions (which we note by indicts 0 for subject,1 for first object...). Notice that the Tree Family name does not change when lexical rules apply. a substitution node,0marks the head. We standard TAG trees for commodity of exposition, although independent linguistic work sugsests to slightly modify challenging for example the distinction between and V levels (see Abeille, in preparation). Each tree is identified by a Tree family name associated to a feature bundle corresponding to the rules it involves. For example, a2, a3 and a4 arc respectively markedll: al (nOVnl) a2 (nOVnI) passive=passive = + Wb-O=- Wh-1. - Wb-1 = - Wh-0 = erg = a3 (nOVnl) a4 (nOVnl) passive passive = + Wh-1 = - Wh-1 r-- + erg= + Wh-O - A given tree can belong to several tree families at the same time, which helps factorizing the grammar in a parsing perspective. For example, a3 can also be considered as belonging to the nOV Family (for verbs with one NP argument) with a different feature bundle : passive = -; Wh-0= -. The lexical items heading the tree constrains its interpretation, eg &apos;sleep&apos; will interpret a3 as nOV, while &apos;bake&apos; or &apos;walk&apos; interpret it as nOVnl. Lexical constraints on syntactic and lexical rules are handled by having the head select its own subset of trees in its tree family. For example, &apos;resemble&apos; selects only active trees; &apos;rumored&apos; only passive ones, and &apos;love&apos; [love],V : nOVnl [erg= -] [resemble]V: nOVnl [passive = -; erg= [rumoredl,V: nOVnl [passive = + ] Idonatei,V; to,P : nOVPn1 [dative= -;erg= -] lgive],V;to,P: nOVPnl [erg= -I Ispare1,V:n0Vn112 These features work as follows: when nothing is said about a feature, it means that the predicate selects trees with the feature being plus of minus; One might explicitly define matendes, or links such trees: a passive rule for example, changes the feature passive of the tree and intervert the features bearing on NO and NI. Work is being curretly done along this line with T. Becker, Y. Schabes and K. Vijay Shanker. 12 We note with square the set of inflected forms of a lexical item. For example, (eve] = Sive, gives, gave, elvie&amp; given. Wc use a restriction principle to rule out erg= + passive= + (or dative= +), and vice so feature does not have to the lexicon for &apos;rumored&apos;. when a feature is marked plus, it means that only trees with this feature plus are selected (ie that the corresponding rule is &apos;forced&apos; to apply). Such lexicalization&apos; of syntactic rules applies similarly in idiomatic and non idiomatic constructions. 3.2 Idioms in a Lexicalized Tree Adjoining Grammar Tags seem a natural framework to represent structures which at the same time are semantically non compositional and should be assigned regular syntactic structures (Abeille and Schabes 1989, 1990). Idioms are thus made fall into the same grammar as non idiomatic constructions. The only specificity of idioms is that they are selected by a multicomponent head (called &apos;anchor&apos;) and may select elementary trees which are more extended than non idiomatic constructions. Here are some examples of elementary trees for &apos;kick the bucket&apos;, &apos;bury the hatchet&apos; and &apos;take NP into account&apos;: 4 VP N1 I I the bucket o;N NP1+ P1&apos;2NA NP2N I 1A The lexical anchors are respectively &apos;kick&apos;, &apos;the&apos; and &apos;bucket&apos; for lel, &apos;bury&apos;, &apos;the&apos; and &apos;hatchet&apos; for r2, and &apos;take&apos;, &apos;into&apos; and &apos;account&apos; for 43. The idiomatic interpretation of sentences such as &apos;John kicked the bucket&apos;, as opposed to their 296 NPi I /\ I I the betchet counterpart, although it allows for passive: &amp;quot;Par mouche a-t-il 6ti piqué Gross 1989). literal readings, is straigkforwardly based on their distinct derivation treesu: and non elementary trees are gathered into tree families according to the same principles. Here are some examples of the trees belonging to the Family of idioms with a frozen object (nOVDN1): Similarly, idioms bear syntactic features constraining the elementary trees of the Tree Family they select. In the nOVDN1 Tree Family, for example, &apos;kick the bucket&apos; selects only al, and the trees corresponding to wh-movernent on NO &apos;bury the hatchet&apos; selects also the trees for passive (and possibly topicalization on Ni). [bury],V;the,D;hatchet,N: nOVDN1 [Wh-N1 = -] lkickj,V;the,D;bucket,N: nOVDN1 [passive=-; Wb-N1 = -; Top-N1= -] There are some idioms which exist only in the passive form, or in the question form, and the corresponding trees are directly selected. In &amp;quot;8tre pris par le temps&amp;quot; (to be lacks its active counterpart (* Le temps prend Jean), and &amp;quot;Quelle mouche a piqué NP ?&amp;quot; (What&apos;s eating NP ?) lacks its non interrogative 13 The derived trees am the same (modulo the syntactic features explained above). 297 [prendrel,V;le,D;temps,N: DNOVn11passive. +1 Ipiquer1,V;mouche,4 : NOVnl [Wh-NO +1 Notice that the tree familiy name tells not only about the argument structure but also about the head being multicomponent or not (all head elements are noted with capital letter). Usually, no part of a multicomponent head can be omitted, and trees that are possible for this argument structure but in which all head elements could not be inserted will be ruled out. For example, what-questions (noted Wh-i) are generally disallowed with frozen nominaLs (and thus not noted for each lexical entry), whereas with wh-determiners (noted are not: John took a trip to Spain ? Which trip to Spain did John take ? (Abefilt et al. 1990) In fact, as has been noted by M. Gross 1989 for French, Wh-Ni questions seem to be ruled out when the determiner of the argument is completely fixed, as the following contrasts show: John spilled the/those beans John buried the/itthis/#a hatchet Which bean(s) did John spill? * Which hatchet did John bury? This generalization which can be captured since the Tree family names will be different (with D for frozen determiners, and d for not frozen ones): [spill],V; n0VdN1 [buryl,V; the,D; hatchet,N: nOVDN1 The trees for the Wh-N questions will thus belong to the corresponding and not to the &apos;D&apos; ones. CONCLUSION It has been shown that takine idiomatic or semiidiomatic constructions into account in a French or English grammar forces one to define some lexical constraints on syntactic rules such as whquestion, pronominalization and topicalization. Such a lexical treatment has been exemplified using Lexicalized Tree Adjoining grammars. An interesting point about TAGs is that, due to their extended domain of locality, they enable one to consider as &apos;lexical&apos; syntactic rules bearing on A 7&amp;quot;N A vo 6 S vp / A VO (PP) / ■ A may.

The only specificity of idioms is that they are selected by a multicomponent head (called &apos;anchor&apos;) and may select elementary trees which are more extended than non idiomatic constructions. Here are some examples of elementary trees for &apos;kick the bucket&apos;, &apos;bury the hatchet&apos; and &apos;take NP into account&apos;: 4 NP04, VP V e NPI rklckj D1 N1 I I the bucket o;N NP1+ P1&apos;2NA akel 0112 NP2N A I into 1 I-64 A 4). se count The lexical anchors are respectively &apos;kick&apos;, &apos;the&apos; and &apos;bucket&apos; for lel, &apos;bury&apos;, &apos;the&apos; and &apos;hatchet</context>

However, as noted by both authors, lexical idiosyncrasies will never be eliminated altogether - 9 Tree Family names (GOV, nOVnl...) are somewhat similar to &apos;lexical forms&apos; in LG in the sense that they capture both the predicate argument structure and the associated grammatical functions (which we note by indicts 0 for subject,1 for first object...).

There has often been discussions about whether certain rules, (eg passive or extraposition) should be considered of one kind or the other. But it has seldom been realized, to the best of our knowledge, how often &apos;syntactic&apos; rules are prevented to apply on what seems purely lexical grounds5. Our discussion crucially relies on idiomatic or semi-idiomatic constructions. We believe that a sizable grammar of natural language, as well as any realistic natural language application, cannot ignore them, since their frequency is quite high in real texts (M. Gross 1989).

Usually, no part of a multicomponent head can be omitted, and trees that are possible for this argument structure but in which all head elements could not be inserted will be ruled out. For example, what-questions (noted Wh-i) are generally disallowed with frozen nominaLs (and thus not noted for each lexical entry), whereas questions with wh-determiners (noted Wh-Ni) are not: John took a trip to Spain # What did John take? ? Which trip to Spain did John take ? (Abefilt et al. 1990) In fact, as has been noted by M. Gross 1989 for French, Wh-Ni questions seem to be ruled out when the determiner of the argument is completely fixed, as the following contrasts show: John spilled the/those beans John buried the/itthis/#a hatchet Which bean(s) did John spill? * Which hatchet did John bury?
