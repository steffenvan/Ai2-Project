been held to hinge on whether the X-bar structure
(corresponding to NP --&gt; Det Nom rather than NP --&gt;
Det A N PP) is correct in the constituent structure claims
it makes. P also states that the categories N, V, A,
and P &amp;quot;correspond to words that are two-place predi-
cates&amp;quot; (p. 178), which cannot be right, since one-place
verbs like_elapse and three-place verbs like give also
appear in V constituents.
The language of P&apos;s chapters is full of impressionistic
turns of phrase; &amp;quot;we can think of X as &amp;quot;X acts as
Y&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;X functions as y- occur frequently. Differen-
tiating GB from transformational grammar, P asserts:
&amp;quot;In GB, the logical form (or semantics) of a sentence is
considered to be just as important as the surface struc-
ture of a sentence (the words that we actually hear)&amp;quot; (p.
188). This appears to suggest that a crucial difference
between GB and transformational grammar lies in a
value judgment, namely how &amp;quot;important&amp;quot; logical form
is held to be. It also manages to confuse logical form
(which is syntactic) with semantics, s-structure with PF,
and sentences with utterances.
Yet these distinctions are highly germane to the
material discussed. For example, if surface structure
contains &amp;quot;the words that we actually hear&amp;quot;, it is not
clear that there is any coherent interpretation of P&apos;s long
excursus (pp. 155-159) on that old chestnut of theoret-
ical syntax, the putative blocking of the rule
want to ---&gt; wanna
by wh-movement traces. P relies on a distinction be-
tween two kinds of empty string: e &amp;quot;is an empty
category, in the sense that we can&apos;t hear it spoken&amp;quot; (p.
157), but it is not the empty string A introduced by MAK
on page 3, because, crucially, A e (p. 158). The
perceptive student will ask what the formal distinction
is between [NPA] and [Npe], and will find no answer.
(Linguistically, there is published evidence that the
explanation P seeks to present is not adequate anyway;
see Postal and Pullum (1982).)
On page 195, P talks of &amp;quot;a notion of &apos;closeness&apos; based
not on distance in a contiguous string, but on the
nearness in a tree&amp;quot;. He then offers this definition of
such a &amp;quot;closeness&amp;quot; relation:
C-command: Node a c-commands node 0 if the first
branching node dominating a also dominates 13.
This is extraordinarily vague for a definition in a text-
book on formal language theory. The if should be iff;
first is not defined; branching node is not defined;
dominates is not defined (or used anywhere else in the
book, as far as I could determine: typically, P has not
checked whether MAK use the notion of a dominance
relation when talking about trees); and it is not made
clear whether a and 0 have to be distinct nodes, or
whether one can dominate the other. In addition, the
reference to &amp;quot;closeness&amp;quot; remains obscure: there is no
limit to how far a c-commanding node may be from a
c-commanded node, either in paths through the tree or
symbols in the string (a may be indefinitely far down a
chain of unit productions, and p may be embedded
anywhere in an arbitrarily complex structure). What-
ever else c-command may be useful for, it does not
guarantee &amp;quot;closeness&amp;quot; between a and p.
The foregoing are just a few of a very large number of
examples that could be cited of inadequacies in the
natural language portion of this book. The casual expo-
sition of basic natural language syntax presented in the
last two chapters ill befits a text on how to study
languages and grammars with mathematical precision.
It is vital for the future of computational linguistics
that linguists&apos; study of languages and grammars should
not remain at this level of informality and confusion. We
need a textbook that deals with the grammars and
properties of natural languages and programming lan-
guages with equal seriousness. This one does not satisfy
that description.

In Attribute-Value Logic and the Theory of Grammar,
Mark Johnson has written an important work in the area
of formal syntax. Johnson&apos;s underlying thesis that at-
tribute-value—based grammars can be viewed as sys-
tems of logic permits a detailed analysis of their formal,
computational, and linguistic properties. Although this
book does not propose a specific linguistic theory, it
does have direct implications for research into attribute-
value grammars, which represent a major trend in
contemporary grammatical theory.

Book Reviews Attribute-Value Logic and the Theory of Grammar
After an introductory chapter that includes a brief
history of attribute-value grammars and the notion of
unification, the next three chapters develop the formal
analyses. Chapter 2, the foundation of the book, is
carefully presented, starting with the fundamental prop-
erties of attribute-value structures together with a lan-
guage A in which the properties are expressible. Since
the structures as defined are too general, in that they
may admit illegitimate linguistic constructs, three plau-
sible restrictions are proposed in order to constrain the
class of attribute-value structures with respect to their
linguistic expressiveness. Axioms and rules of inference
are stated, thereby characterizing a logic called At-
tribute-Value Logic. The next several sections prove
the completeness, soundness, and compactness of the
axiomatization as well as decidability results concerning
the validity and satisfiability of well—formed formulae
(wffs) of the language A. By mapping the wffs of A into
quantifier-free first-order logic with equality and func-
tion symbols, the satisfiability problem of the wffs of A
is shown to be NP-complete. Finally, aspects of the
attribute-value structures being investigated are con-
trasted with the unification formulations such as those
of Karttunen (1984), Kasper and Rounds (1986), and
Moshier and Rounds (1987).
With Chapter 2 as a basis, Chapter 3 focuses on
attribute-value structures and natural language process-
ing. One major theorem is the undecidability of the
universal recognition problem for attribute-value gram-
mars. The Off-line Parsability Constraint is then intro-
duced; this disallows unbounded nonbranching (unary)
dominance relations and empty strings appearing as
terminal nodes. Under this constraint, the universal
recognition problem is proven to be decidable for at-
tribute-value grammars. Moreover, assuming the Off-
line Parsability Constraint, an algorithm for deriving or
producing the syntactic structure from a given string is
specified, thus providing a solution to the universal
parsing problem for attribute-value grammars.
Chapter 4 shifts attention from computational issues
to linguistic questions. It is acknowledged that while the
formal mechanisms that have been developed do re-
strict some types of grammatical analyses, others re-
mained undetermined, such as the representation of
grammatical relations. The discussion centers on direct
encoding (Bresnan 1982) versus hierarchical encoding
(Karttunen 1986; Pollard and Sag 1987) of grammatical
relations and their differing analyses of the Dutch
double infinitive construction. It is also shown that the
following three properties are mutually inconsistent (p.
103):

<bodyText confidence="0.987581721311476">
(iii) The Off-line Parsability Constraint.
As noted in the book, this result has direct conse-
quences for current versions of LFG.
The final chapter is an extended conclusion that not
only summarizes the major results of the book but also
suggests specific research proposals.
The book is well structured and the arguments and
proofs are well written. The work is not reliant on any
particular form of attribute-value grammar, in that the
definition of attribute-value structure is sufficiently
broad. This abstractness is necessary, of course, in
order to achieve general results across a universe of
grammars that have an attribute-value framework in
common. As a result, the book presupposes a working
knowledge of logic, model theory, and complexity the-
ory. However, there are many helpful examples illus-
trating the basic concept or notion underlying a defini-
tion or construction. These examples are judiciously
based on LFG rather than on other forms of attribute-
value grammars that may be less familiar.
There are several editorial errors; e.g., incorrect
subscript in equation (iv) (p. 72), missing &apos;&lt;&apos; in an index
of another equation (p. 86), and misspellings or missing
words (pp. 67, 93, and 104); however, none are serious
or troublesome.
It is rare for a work to be of interest to mathematical,
computational, and theoretical linguists but Attribute-
Value Logic and the Theory of Grammar is one such
book, in that it examines problems that impact the
research of each type of linguist. For the mathematical
linguist, it shows how classical logic can be employed
for grammatical analyses in a way that is abstracted
away from specific linguistic realizations and claims.
Logic then provides the framework for obtaining com-
pleteness, soundness, compactness, and decidability
results.
Much of the material in the book is relevant to
computational linguists, albeit on an abstract level. The
discussion, proofs, and algorithm pertaining to the
universal recognition and parsing problems are particu-
larly important for research into natural language proc-
essing.
Formal syntacticians should find interest in
Johnson&apos;s discussion of the representation issues of
grammatical relations and their implications for the
double infinitive construction in Dutch. More generally,
the ways that substantive analyses of grammatical pro-
cesses may be crucially dependent upon formalization
of attribute-value structures should help linguists in
their search for deeper explanatory principles of linguis-
tic phenomena.
Beyond the specific formalisms and analyses that are
developed and discussed, there is a broader importance
of this book to mathematical, computational, and theo-
retical linguists. Although there are sections that are of
special interest to each type of linguist, the book as a
whole clearly illustrates that problems investigated from
a mathematical, computational, and theoretical frame-
work share a common foundation. A study that formally
characterizes the relationships and interdependencies of
the logical, processing, and syntactic aspects of gram-

Finally, aspects of the attribute-value structures being investigated are contrasted with the unification formulations such as those of Karttunen (1984), Kasper and Rounds (1986), and Moshier and Rounds (1987). With Chapter 2 as a basis, Chapter 3 focuses on attribute-value structures and natural language processing. One major theorem is the undecidability of the universal recognition problem for attribute-value grammars. The Off-line Parsability Constraint is then introduced; this disallows unbounded nonbranching (unary) dominance relations and empty strings appearing as terminal nodes. Under this constraint, the universal recognition problem is proven to be decidable for attribute-value grammars. Moreover, assuming the Offline Parsability Constraint, an algorithm for deriving or producing the syntactic structure from a given string is specified, thus providing a solution to the universal parsing problem for attribute-value grammars. Chapter 4 shifts attention from computational issues to linguistic questions. It is acknowledged that while the mechanisms that have been developed do restrict some types of grammatical analyses, others remained undetermined, such as the representation of grammatical relations. The discussion centers on direct encoding (Bresnan 1982) versus hierarchical encoding (Karttunen 1986; Pollard and Sag 1987) of grammatical relations and their differing analyses of the Dutch double infinitive construction. It is also shown that the following three properties are mutually inconsistent (p. 103): (i) A &apos;direct encoding&apos; of the grammatical relations, (ii) An analysis of the double infinitive construction in Dutch based on the analysis of Bresnan et al (1982), and (iii) The Off-line Parsability Constraint. As noted in the book, this result has direct consequences for current versions of LFG. The final chapter is an extended conclusion that not only summarizes the major results of the book but also suggests specific research proposals. The book is well structured and the arguments and proofs are well written. The work is not reliant on any particular form of attribute-value grammar, in that the definition of attribute-value structure is sufficiently broad.

Although there are sections that are of special interest to each type of linguist, the book as a whole clearly illustrates that problems investigated from a mathematical, computational, and theoretical framework share a common foundation. A study that formally characterizes the relationships and interdependencies of logical, processing, and syntactic aspects of gram- 264 Computational Linguistics, Volume 15, Number 4, December 1989 Book Reviews New Directions in Machine Translation (Proceedings of the Conference, Budapest, August 1988) mar is not only of interest to all but should also serve as a model for similar research programs not only into attribute-value structures but alternative grammatical frameworks as well.</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.929574538461538">Machine Translation (MT) research is thriving, and papers on this and related topics nowadays often account for many of the papers read at meetings on computational linguistics. The book reviewed here consists of 16 papers on MT (plus an additional short paper that summarizes some of the results of the conference) presented at a gathering held in Budapest in August 1988. The theme of the conference, as stated by one of the editors, was to &amp;quot;attempt to highlight some new approaches and viewpoints against the background of an up-to-date worldwide overview&amp;quot;.

P relies on a distinction between two kinds of empty string: e &amp;quot;is an empty category, in the sense that we can&apos;t hear it spoken&amp;quot; (p. 157), but it is not the empty string A introduced by MAK on page 3, because, crucially, A e (p. 158). The perceptive student will ask what the formal distinction is between [NPA] and [Npe], and will find no answer. (Linguistically, there is published evidence that the explanation P seeks to present is not adequate anyway; see Postal and Pullum (1982).) On page 195, P talks of &amp;quot;a notion of &apos;closeness&apos; based not on distance in a contiguous string, but on the nearness in a tree&amp;quot;. He then offers this definition of such a &amp;quot;closeness&amp;quot; relation: C-command: Node a c-commands node 0 if the first branching node dominating a also dominates 13. This is extraordinarily vague for a definition in a textbook on formal language theory. The if should be iff; first is not defined; branching node is not defined; dominates is not defined (or used anywhere else in the book, as far as I could determine: typically, P has not checked whether MAK use the notion of</context>

The discussion centers on direct encoding (Bresnan 1982) versus hierarchical encoding (Karttunen 1986; Pollard and Sag 1987) of grammatical relations and their differing analyses of the Dutch double infinitive construction. It is also shown that the following three properties are mutually inconsistent (p. 103): (i) A &apos;direct encoding&apos; of the grammatical relations, (ii) An analysis of the double infinitive construction in Dutch based on the analysis of Bresnan et al (1982), and (iii) The Off-line Parsability Constraint. As noted in the book, this result has direct consequences for current versions of LFG. The final chapter is an extended conclusion that not only summarizes the major results of the book but also suggests specific research proposals. The book is well structured and the arguments and proofs are well written. The work is not reliant on any particular form of attribute-value grammar, in that the definition of attribute-value structure is sufficiently broad.
