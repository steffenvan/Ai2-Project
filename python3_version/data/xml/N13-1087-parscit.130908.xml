Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999915894736842">
One way to improve the accuracy of auto-
matic speech recognition (ASR) is to use dis-
criminative language modeling (DLM), which
enhances discrimination by learning where
the ASR hypotheses deviate from the uttered
sentences. However, DLM requires large
amounts of ASR output to train. Instead,
we can simulate the output of an ASR sys-
tem, in which case the training becomes semi-
supervised. The advantage of using simu-
lated hypotheses is that we can generate as
many hypotheses as we want provided that we
have enough text material. In typical scenar-
ios, transcribed in-domain data is limited but
large amounts of out-of-domain (OOD) data
is available. In this study, we investigate how
semi-supervised training performs with OOD
data. We find out that OOD data can yield im-
provements comparable to in-domain data.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999924276595745">
Discriminative language modeling (DLM) helps
ASR systems to discriminate between acoustically
similar word sequences in the process of choos-
ing the most accurate transcription of an utterance.
DLM characterizes and learns from ASR errors by
comparing the reference transcription of the utter-
ance and the candidate hypotheses generated by the
ASR system. Although previous studies based on
this supervised setting have been successful (Roark
et al., 2007; Arısoy et al., 2009; Arısoy et al., 2012;
Sak et al., 2012), they require large amounts of tran-
scribed speech data and a well-trained in-domain
ASR system, both of which are hard to obtain. To
overcome this difficulty, instead of training with the
real ASR output, we can use simulated output, in
which case the training becomes semi-supervised.
Semi-supervised training for discriminative lan-
guage modeling has been shown to achieve as good
word error rate (WER) reduction as the training done
with real ASR output (Sagae et al., 2012; C¸elebi et
al., 2012). In this approach, first a confusion model
(CM) is estimated from supervised data. This CM
contains all seen confusions and their occurrence
probabilities in hypotheses generated by an ASR
system. Then, the CM is used to generate a num-
ber of alternative-but-incorrect hypotheses, or simu-
lated hypotheses, for a given sentence. Since the CM
characterizes the errors that the ASR system makes,
simulated hypotheses carry these characteristics. At
the end, the DLM is trained on the reference sen-
tences and their simulated hypotheses. Although be-
ing able to simulate the output of the ASR system
allows us to generate as much output as we need
for the DLM training, there is not always enough
text data that is in the same domain as the ASR sys-
tem. Yet, it is easier to find large amounts of out-of-
domain (OOD) text data. In this study, we extend the
previous studies where in-domain text data was used
for hypothesis simulation. Instead of using limited
in-domain data, we experiment with larger amounts
of OOD data for hypothesis simulation.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In
Section 2, we summarize the related work. In Sec-
tion 3, we explain the methods to simulate the hy-
potheses and to train the DLM. We give the exper-
imental results in Section 4 before concluding with
Section 5.

<bodyText confidence="0.999987177777778">
The earliest work on hypothesis simulation for DLM
was done by Kurata et al. (2009; 2012). They gen-
erate the probable n-best lists that an ASR system
may output for a hypothetical input utterance given
a word sequence. In another study, Tan et al. (2010)
propose a system for channel modeling of ASR
for simulating the ASR corruption using a phrase-
based machine translation system trained between
the reference and output phoneme sequences from
a phoneme recognizer. Jyothi and Fosler-Lussier
(2010) also model the phonetic confusions using a
confusion matrix that takes into account word-based
phone confusion log likelihoods and distances be-
tween the phonetic acoustic models. This model
is then used to generate confusable word graphs
for training a DLM using the perceptron algorithm.
Xu et al. (2009) propose the concept of cohorts
and report significant WER improvement for self-
supervised DLM. Similarly, Sagae et al. (2012) use
phrasal cohorts to simulate ASR output and the per-
ceptron algorithm for training. They observe half of
the WER reduction that the fully supervised meth-
ods achieve. In another parallel study, C¸elebi et al.
(2012) work on a Turkish ASR system and consider
various confusion models at four different granular-
ities (word, morph, syllable, and phone) and differ-
ent sampling methods to choose from a large list of
simulated hypotheses. They observe that the strat-
egy that matches the word error (WE) distribution
of the simulated hypotheses to the WE distribution
of the ASR outputs yields the best WER reduction.
While the previous studies use in-domain data
sets for simulation, it is quite common to collect
large amounts of OOD text data from the web. How-
ever, given the nature of web data, some kind of se-
lection mechanism is needed to ensure quality. Bu-
lyko et al. (2007) use perplexity-based filtering to
select a relevant subset from vast amounts of web
data in order to increase the training data of the gen-
erative LM used by the ASR system. There are also
studies that use a relative-entropy based selection
mechanism in order to match the n-gram distribution
of the selected data against the in-domain data by
Sethy et al. (2006; 2009). In this study, we consider
the perplexity-based selection method for a start.

3.1 Sentence Selection from OOD Data
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999992111111111">
In order to select sentences from the OOD data,
we use three methods in addition to random selec-
tion. We calculate the perplexity of each sentence
with SRILM toolkit, which gives normalized scores
with respect to the length of the sentence. Then,
we order sentences based on their perplexity scores
in increasing order. Perplexity is calculated by a
LM trained on in-domain data. After ordering, the
top of the list contains those sentences that resem-
ble the in-domain data the most whereas the sen-
tences at the bottom resemble the in-domain data the
least. We apply the three methods on this ordered
list of sentences. The first two methods, TOP-N and
BOTTOM-N, simply get the top and bottom N sen-
tences, respectively. The third method, RC-NxM,
picks uniformly separated N clusters of M consec-
utive sentences, while making sure that top and bot-
tom M sentences are among the selected ones.

3.2 Hypothesis Simulation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.989180833333333">
Semi-supervised DLM training uses artificially gen-
erated hypotheses which mimic the ASR system
output. To generate the hypotheses, we follow
the three-step finite state transducer based pipeline
given in C¸elebi et al. (2012) and summarized by the
following composition sequence:
sample(N-best(prune(WoLWoCM)oLM–1o!9M))
In the first step of the pipeline, we use the confusion
model transducer (CM) to generate all possible con-
fusions that the ASR system can make for a given
reference sentence W. We consider syllable, morph
and word based confusion models, and convert W
to these units using the lexicon LW. The generated
alternatives are pruned for efficiency reasons.
As the output of the first step may include many
implausible sequences, the second step converts
them to morphs using LM–1 and reweights them
with a morph-based language model !9M to favor
the meaningful sequences. For this, we use three ap-
proaches. The first approach is to use the LM that is
used by the ASR system, called GEN-LM. The sec-
ond LM called ASR-LM is trained from the output
of the ASR system, whereas the third approach is
not to use any language model, denoted by NO-LM,
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999946434782609">
in which case we just use the scores coming from
the confusion model in the first step. A large list of
of N-best (N = 1000) hypotheses are produced at
this stage.
The third step, called sampling, involves picking a
subset of the hypotheses from a larger set with broad
variety. This step is done in order to pick samples so
as to make sure that they include error variety in-
stead of just high scoring hypotheses. As done by
C¸elebi et al. (2012), we use four sampling meth-
ods to pick 50 hypotheses out of the highest scoring
1000 hypotheses. The simplest of them is Top50,
where we select the highest scoring 50 hypotheses.
Another method is Uniform Sampling (US) which
selects instances from the WER-ordered list in uni-
form intervals. Third method, called RC5x10, forms
5 clusters separated uniformly, each containing 10
hypotheses. Lastly, ASRdist-50 selects 50 hypothe-
ses in such a way that the WE distribution of selected
hypotheses resembles the WE distribution of the real
ASR output as much as it can. We accomplish this
by filling the WE bins with the hypotheses having
required number of WEs.

<bodyText confidence="0.999964727272727">
The training of the DLM involves representing the
training data as feature vectors and processing via
a discriminative learning algorithm. We represent
the simulated N-best lists using unigram features as
described by Dikici et al. (2012). As the learning
algorithm, we apply the WER-sensitive perceptron
algorithm proposed by Sak et al. (2011b), which has
been shown to perform better for reranking ASR hy-
potheses as it minimizes an objective function based
on the WER rather than the number of misclassifi-
cations.

4.1 Experimental Setup
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999989538461539">
We employ DLM on a Turkish broadcast news tran-
scription data set (Arısoy et al., 2009), which com-
prises disjoint training (105356 sentences), held-out
(1947 sentences) and test (1784 sentences) subsets
consisting of ASR outputs represented as N-best
lists. We use Morfessor (Creutz and Lagus, 2005)
to obtain the morph level word segmentations from
which we build the LMs. For semi-supervised ex-
periments, we use the first half of the training sub-
set (t1: 53992 sentences, 965K morphs) to learn
the confusion models, and the reference transcrip-
tions of the second half (t2: 51364 sentences, 935K
morphs) to generate in-domain simulated n-best lists
to be compared against OOD simulated ones. For
this setup, the generative baseline WER and oracle
WER on the held-out set are 22.9% and 14.2% and
on the test set are 22.4% and 13.9%, respectively.
When we use ASR 50-best from t1 for DLM train-
ing, WERs drop to 22.2% and 21.8% on the held-out
and the test sets, respectively.
For OOD data, we use a data set of 10.8M
sentences (140M morphs) from newspaper articles
downloaded from the Internet (Sak et al., 2011a).
To calculate the perplexity of OOD sentences for se-
lection, we use a language model trained over the
reference transcripts and 50-best lists of t1 and t2.

4.2 Results on Out-of-Domain Data
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999775214285714">
We start our experiments with 500K randomly se-
lected OOD sentences, or RAND-500K. We run
the simulation pipeline with four sampling methods,
three confusion and three language models, giving
36 experiments in total. We choose among the pro-
posed sampling approaches and confusion models
using a rank-based comparison as done by Dikici et
al. (2012).
We look at which sampling method performs the
best by first dividing experiments into 9 groups, each
having 4 results from all sampling methods. Within
each group, we rank the sampling methods based on
the WER they achieve in increasing order and take
the average of assigned ranks. ASRdist-50 gets the
lowest average rank of 1.8, while RC5x10, US-50,
and TOP-50 come after with the averages of 2.1, 2.4,
and 3.4, respectively. This shows that ASRdist-50
gives the best WER reduction on OOD data, which
is also true for in-domain data (C¸elebi et al., 2012).
Doing the same rank-based comparison for the
CMs this time, we observe that the syllable and
morph-based models have the same average rank of
1.5, whereas the word-based model has 2.8. How-
ever, a closer look reveals that the syllable-based
CM paired with NO-LM is an outlier because NO-
LM approach allows variety at the output but when
the unit of the confusion model is as small as syl-
lables, it produces too much variety that deterio-

rates the discriminative model. If we don’t consider
the ranks coming from NO-LM, the average rank of
syllable- and morph-based models become 1.1 and
1.8, respectively. Thus, we use syllable-based mod-
els over the others for the rest of the experiments.
Knowing that the ASRdist-50 sampling method
and syllable-based CM together give the best re-
sults for RAND-500K, we experiment with three
more sentence selection methods described in Sec-
tion 3.1. Table 1 shows all the results obtained from
four 500K OOD data sets.

According to Table 1, the highest WER reduc-
tion is achieved with BOTTOM-500K+ASR-LM
and RAND-500K+GEN-LM combinations. While
ASR-LM exceeds the other two LMs only in the
case of BOTTOM-500K, for other three OOD data
sets GEN-LM gives the best results. More interest-
ingly, using OOD sentences resembling in-domain
data (or TOP-500K) is outperformed in all cases,
especially by BOTTOM-500K. To understand this,
we look at the number of morphs in each data set
given in Table 2. Even though each OOD data set
has 500K sentences, BOTTOM-500K has the high-
est number of morphs (∼6.5M) and TOP-500K had
the lowest (∼3.5M), while the other two have around
5.5M morphs. We also look at the morph unigram
distribution (M) of all four data sets and calculat-
ing the KL divergence KL(M  ||U)1 of each M to

gram morph distribution of the TOP-500K data set

BOTTOM-500K has KL distance of 2.7 and the

other words, this shows that TOP-500K has the low-

of KL distance for t2, which can be attributed to the

In this section, we compare the results for in-domain
data with the results for four OOD data sets in
Table 3. In order to see how the size of OOD
data set affects the WER reduction, we start with
50K sentences and increase the size gradually up
to 500K. The first row of Table 3 shows the WER

According to Table 3, even though 50K OOD sen-
tences yield worse results than the same amount of
in-domain sentences, as the size of OOD data set
increases, the amount of WER reduction increases
and surpasses the level obtained by using in-domain
data. What is more interesting is that RAND outper-
forms in-domain data starting from 100K, whereas
BOTTOM starts at a higher WER but drops rela-
tively fast, leveling with RAND starting at 200K.
Note that the best WER achieved with the simulated
data matches the supervised DLM performance us-
ing ASR 50-best from t1, reported in Section 4.1.
Then we go one step further and expand the BOT-
TOM data set to 1M sentences and we observe WER
of 22.1% on the held-out set. This further supports

lower WER we can achieve.
As a side observation, when we calculate the
WER of five 100K-blocks from the RAND-500K
set, we find that the standard deviation of WER is
0.06%, which gives and idea about the significance
level of the WER differences.

WER reductions. The result of merging the real hy-

When combined with the real hypotheses from t1,
RAND500K achieves the same level of WER re-
duction as the simulated hypotheses from t2 on the
heldout set. The results on the test set are also sim-
ilar. On the test set, the combination of the real
hypotheses from t1 and the simulated hypotheses
from t2 achieve 21.5% WER, whereas the WER is
21.6% when the simulated hypotheses from t2 are
replaced by those from RAND500K. This indicates
that enough OOD data can replace the in-domain
data and yield similar performance, even in combi-
nation with in-domain real data.
Moreover, we further expand the OOD data to 1M
for BOTTOM, however even though it reduces the
WER on the heldout set, it achieves slightly higher
WER on the test set (21.7%).
Next, we combine the in-domain real hypotheses
from t1, simulated hypotheses from t2 and simulated
ones from the OOD data sets. However, compared
to the combination of t1 and t2, adding extra 500K
OOD hypotheses on top of those two gives similar
WERs on the held-out set while WERs on the test
set increases slightly. From another point of view,
adding in-domain simulated hypotheses from t2 on
top of real ones from t1 and 500K OOD data (rows
2-5 in Table 4) provides slight WER improvement
on the held-out set but not on the test set.

5 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999965928571429">
In this study, we investigate whether we can
achieve the same level of WER reduction for semi-
supervised DLM with the large amounts of OOD
data instead of in-domain data. We observe that
ASRdist-50 sampling method and syllable-based
CMs yield the best results with the OOD data. More-
over, selecting OOD sentences randomly rather than
using perplexity-based methods is enough to achieve
the best WER reduction. We also observe that sim-
ulated hypotheses from the OOD data is almost as
good as in-domain simulated hypotheses or even real
ones. As a future work, we will increase the size of
the OOD data and examine other methods like rela-
tive entropy based OOD selection.

<abstract confidence="0.9988712">One way to improve the accuracy of automatic speech recognition (ASR) is to use discriminative language modeling (DLM), which enhances discrimination by learning where the ASR hypotheses deviate from the uttered sentences. However, DLM requires large amounts of ASR output to train. Instead, we can simulate the output of an ASR system, in which case the training becomes semisupervised. The advantage of using simulated hypotheses is that we can generate as many hypotheses as we want provided that we have enough text material. In typical scenarios, transcribed in-domain data is limited but large amounts of out-of-domain (OOD) data is available. In this study, we investigate how semi-supervised training performs with OOD data. We find out that OOD data can yield improvements comparable to in-domain data.</abstract>

As the learning algorithm, we apply the WER-sensitive perceptron algorithm proposed by Sak et al. (2011b), which has been shown to perform better for reranking ASR hypotheses as it minimizes an objective function based on the WER rather than the number of misclassifications. 4 Experiments 4.1 Experimental Setup We employ DLM on a Turkish broadcast news transcription data set (Arısoy et al., 2009), which comprises disjoint training (105356 sentences), held-out (1947 sentences) and test (1784 sentences) subsets consisting of ASR outputs represented as N-best lists. We use Morfessor (Creutz and Lagus, 2005) to obtain the morph level word segmentations from which we build the LMs. For semi-supervised experiments, we use the first half of the training subset (t1: 53992 sentences, 965K morphs) to learn the confusion models, and the reference transcriptions of the second half (t2: 51364 sentences, 935K morphs) to generate in-domain simulated n-best lists to be compared against OOD simulated ones. For this setup, the generative baseline WER and oracle WER on the held-out set are 22.9% and 14.2% and on the test set are 22.4% and 13.9%, respectively.

However, given the nature of web data, some kind of selection mechanism is needed to ensure quality. Bulyko et al. (2007) use perplexity-based filtering to select a relevant subset from vast amounts of web data in order to increase the training data of the generative LM used by the ASR system. There are also studies that use a relative-entropy based selection mechanism in order to match the n-gram distribution of the selected data against the in-domain data by Sethy et al. (2006; 2009). In this study, we consider the perplexity-based selection method for a start. 3 Method 3.1 Sentence Selection from OOD Data In order to select sentences from the OOD data, we use three methods in addition to random selection. We calculate the perplexity of each sentence with SRILM toolkit, which gives normalized scores with respect to the length of the sentence. Then, we order sentences based on their perplexity scores in increasing order. Perplexity is calculated by a LM trained on in-domain data.
