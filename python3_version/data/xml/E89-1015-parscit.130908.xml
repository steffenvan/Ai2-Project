for the assignment of pitch accent positions
in text-to-speech conversion. The algorithm is
closely modeled on current linguistic accounts
of accent placement, and assumes a surface
syntactic analysis of the input. It comprises a
small number of heuristic rules for determining
which phrases of a sentence are to be focussed
upon; the exact location of a pitch accent
within a focussed phrase is determined mainly
on the basis of the syntactic relations holding
between the elements of the phrase. A
perceptual evaluation experiment showed that
the algorithm proposed here leads to improved
subjective speech quality as compared to a
naive algorithm which accents all and only
content words.

1. Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996630666666667">
This paper deals with the prosodic com-
ponent of a text-to-speech system for Dutch,
more in particular with the rules for assign-
ing pitch accents (sentence accents) to words
in an input sentence. Whereas other work on
accent rules for Dutch speech synthesis
(Kager &amp; Quene, 1987) did not assume a
syntactically analysed input, I will here work
from the assumption that the text-to-speech
system has a large dictionary as well as a
syntactic parser at its disposal.
The paper is organized as follows: in
section 2 I shortly introduce the notions
focus and (pitch) accent as I will be using
them; as my framework, I will choose the
Eindhoven model of Dutch intonation (&apos;t Hart
&amp; Cohen, 1973; &apos;t Hart &amp; Collier, 1975) in
conjunction with Gussenhoven&apos;s (1983) accent
placement theory. In section 3 I discuss the
rules that connect a domain of focus to an
accent on a particular word. The assignment
of focus domains is dealt with in section 4.
At the end of this section I summarize my
proposals in the form of an accent assignment
algorithm. In section 5 I present some results
obtained in a perceptual evaluation of this al-
gorithm.

2. A two-stage model of accent placement
Work on Dutch intonation at the In-
stitute for Perception Research (IPO) in
Eindhoven has resulted in an inventory of
elementary pitch movements that make up the
occurring Dutch intonation contours (&apos;t Hart
&amp; Cohen, 1973; &apos;t Hart &amp; Collier, 1975). The
phonetic characteristics of these pitch
movements are known precisely, and this
knowledge can be used in the synthesis of
natural-sounding Dutch intonation contours.
It was found that some of these elementary
pitch movements cause the syllable on which
they are executed to be perceived as ac-
cented. I will use the term pitch accent or
</tableCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.992659774193549">
simply accent to refer to prominence caused
by the presence of such an accent-lending
pitch movement. Of course, the intonation
model does not predict where in a sentence
pitch accents or intonational boundaries will
be located, but when these locations are
provided as input, the model is capable of
generating a natural-sounding contour. In the
remainder of this paper I will deal specifically
with pitch accent assignment.
It is relatively standard nowadays to
view accent placement as a process involving
two stages (cf. Ladd, 1980; Gussenhoven, 1983;
Fuchs, 1984; Baart, 1987): in the first stage it
is decided which constituents of a sentence
contain relatively important information (e.g.
because they add new information to the back-
ground shared by speaker and hearer) and are
therefore to be focussed upon; the decision to
focus certain parts of a sentence and not
focus other parts is based on semantico-
pragmatic information and in principle cannot
be predicted from the lexico-syntactic
structure of a sentence. In the second stage,
the exact location of a pitch accent within a
focussed constituent is determined; here
lexico-syntactic structure does play a crucial
role. The following example, cited from Ladd
(1980), illustrates these ideas. (In the
examples, pitch accent is indicated by means
of capitalization.)
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.778966285714286">
(2) Basic Labelling Rule (BLR):
A pair of sister nodes [A B] is labelled
[s w] if A is an argument; otherwise the
labelling is [w s].
(1) even a nineteenth century professor of
CLASSICS wouldn&apos;t have allowed himself
to be so pedantic
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.9595305">
In this case, it is probably the speaker&apos;s
intention to focus on the subject NP; we can
say that all the material from a to classics is
[+ focus], while the rest of the sentence is [-
focus]. Given the speaker&apos;s decision to focus
on the subject, an accent is placed by rule on
the last lexical element within this constituent.
In the following sections, I first discuss
the rules that place an accent within a
focussed constituent in Dutch, and next turn
to the problem of assigning focus to the
constituents of a sentence.
3. From focus to accent
As will be clear from the paragraphs
above, I assume that accent placement is
predictable if the focussing structure of a
sentence is known (for discussion see Gussen-
hoven et al., 1987; Baart, 1987). I adopt
Gussenhoven&apos;s (1983) idea that accent place-
ment is sensitive to the argument structure of
a sentence; however, I replace his semantic
orientation by a syntactic one and apply the
term argument to any constituent which is
selected by the subcategorization frame of
some lexical head, including subjects.
Input to the accent rules is a binary
branching syntactic constituent tree, where
apart from syntactic category a node is
provided with information concerning its
argument status (either argument or not an
argument of some lexical head), and where
nodes dominating a focussed constituent are
assigned the feature [ + focus], while nodes
dominating unfocussed material are [-focus].
In order to arrive at an accentuation pattern,
three rules and a well-formedness condition
are to be applied to this input. A first rule
(see (2)) applies iteratively to pairs of sister
nodes in the input tree, replacing the syntactic
labels with the labels s (for &apos;strong&apos;) or w (for
&apos;weak&apos;), familiar from metrical phonology. By
convention, whenever a node is labelled s its
sister has to be labelled w and vice versa,
the labeltings [s s] and [w w] being excluded
for pairs of sister nodes.
The function of the w/s-labelling is to
indicate which element of a phrase will bear
the accent when the phrase is in focus: after
the application of focus assignment and w/s-
labelling rules, an accent will be assigned to
every terminal that is connected to a domin-
ating [+ focus] node by a path that consists ex-
clusively of s-nodes.
In (3) I illustrate the operation of the
BLR. All left-hand sisters in (3) are labelled w,
except for the NP een mooi bock, which is at
argument. Granted a focus on the predicate,
accent will be assigned to the element boeh
(there is a path from bock to the [ + focus]
node that consists of s-nodes only).

I have a nice book bought
[+ focus]

</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.887451">
The output of the BLR may be modified
by two additional rules. First, the Rhythm Rule
accounts for cases of rhythmical accent shift
see (4).
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.544219">
(4) Rhythm Rule (RR, applies to the outpul
of the BLR):
Conditions:
(a) C is dominated by a focus
(b) B and C are string-adjacent
(c) A is not a pronoun, article, prepos-
ition or conjunction
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.8233396">
In (5), where we assume focus on both the
main verb and the time adverbial, the acceni
pattern on the adverbial has been modified 133
the RR (the accent which is normally realizec
on nacht has been shifted to hele).
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.976442833333333">
Until now, nothing prevents the label s
from being assigned to a node which is [-
focus]. The following rule, adopted from Ladd
(1980) takes care of this case. The rule makes
sure that a [-focus] node is labelled w; by
convention, its sister node becomes s.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.493065333333333">
(6) Default Accent (DA):
s —I■ w
[-focus]
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.989709615384616">
While arguments are normally labelled s and
therefore likely to receive accent, there are
some cases where we do not want an argument
to be accented. A case in point are [-focus]
pronouns. In (7a) we have an example of a
lexical object NP (een speld); in (7b) this NP
is replaced by a [-focus] pronoun (iets). As a
result of the DA rule, it is the particle (op)
that receives the accent in (7b), instead of the
object.
(7a) (hij raapt) een SPELD op
he picks a pin up
[ + focus]

</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.97778024137931">
In addition to the rules presented thus
far, a well-formedness condition is necessary
in order to account for the focus-accent
relation. It has been noted by Gussenhoven
(1983) that an unaccented verb may not be
part of a focus domain if it is directly
preceded by an accented adjunct. For in-
stance, in (8a)
(8a) (in ZEIST) is een FABRIEK verwoest
in Zeist is a factory destroyed
the verb (verwoest) is unaccented. There is
no problem here: the VP as a whole is in
focus, due to the accent on the argument een
fabriek. Consider, however, (8b):
(8b) (in ZEIST) is een FABRIEK door BRAND
verwoest
in Zeist is a factory by fire
destroyed
This is a somewhat strange sentence. The
accent on door BRAND arouses an impression
of contrast and the verb verwoest is out of
focus. A more neutral way to pronounce this
sentence is given in (8c):
(8c) (in ZEIST) is een FABRIEK door BRAND
VERWOEST
in Zeist is a factory by fire
destroyed
The following condition is proposed in order
to account for this type of data:
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.626268666666667">
(9) Prosodic Mismatch Condition (PMC):
* [ + focus] * [ +focus]
... ...

</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.9610092">
The PMC states that within a focus domain a
weak (w) constituent (such as door brand in
(8b,c)) may not be accented if its strong (s)
sister (such as verwoest in (8b,c)) is unac-
cented.

4. Assigning focus
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.988301739130435">
Assuming that a programme for semantic
interpretation of unrestricted Dutch text will
not be available within the near future, the
following practical strategy is proposed for
assigning focus to constituents in a syntactic
tree. This strategy is based on the insight that
word classes differ with respect to the amount
of information that is typically conveyed by
their members. The central idea is to assign
- 113 -
+ focus] to the maximal projections of
categories that convey extra-grammatical
meaning (nouns, adjectives, verbs, numerals
and most of the adverbs). In addition, [-focus]
is assigned to pronouns. In the case of a coor-
dination, [ +focus] is assigned to each conjunct.
Finally, [ +focus] is assigned to the sisters of
focus-governing elements like niet &apos;not&apos;, ook
&apos;also&apos;, alleen &apos;only&apos;, zeffs &apos;even&apos;, etc. Below I
informally present an accent assignment
algorithm which combines these focus
assignment heuristics with the focus-to-accent
rules discussed in section 3:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.958898882352941">
(1) Read a sentence with its surface struc-
ture representation.
(2) Assign the labels w and s to nodes in
the tree, according to the BLR above.
(3) Assign [-focus] to pronouns.
(4) Apply DA: if an s-node is [-focus],
replace s by w for this node and w by s
for its sister.
(5) Apply the RR, starting out from the
most deeply embedded subtxees.
(6) Assign [ + focus] to S, (non-pronominal)
NP, AP, AdvP and NumP nodes.
(7) Assign [ + focus] to each member of a
coordination.
(8) Assign [ +focus] to the sister of a focus
governor.
(9) Assign [ + focus] to every s-node, the
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.860515714285714">
sister of which has been assigned
[ + focus] (thus avoiding prosodic mis-
match, see the PMC above).
(10) Assign accent to each word that is
connected to a dominating [ +focus] node
via a path that consists exclusively of s-
nodes.

<listItem confidence="0.67785">
(11) Stop.
5. Perceptual evaluation
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.979279083333334">
The accent assignment algorithm has been
implemented as a Pascal programme. Input to
this programme is a Dutch sentence; the user
is asked to provide information about syntac-
tic bracketing and labelling, and about the
argument status of constituents. The pro-
gramme next assigns focus structure and w/s
labelling to the sentence and outputs the
predicted accent pattern.
A small informative text was used for
evaluation of the output of the programme In
this evaluation experiment, the predicted
accent patterns were compared with the accent
patterns spontaneously produced by a humai
reader, as well as with the accent patterns al
predicted by a naive accentuation algorithn
which assigns an accent to every conten
word. Listeners were asked to rate the qualit:
of sentences synthesized with the respectiv■
accent patterns on a 7-point scale. As
summary of the results, I here present th4
mean scores for each of the conditions:
Spontaneous accentuation: 52
Sophisticated algorithm: 4.6
Naive algorithm: 3.3
As one can see, human accentuation is Mil
preferred over the output of the algorithm o
section 4. Of course this is what we expect
as the algorithm does not have access to tht
semantico-pragmatic properties of an inpu
text, such as coreference and contrast. 01
the other hand we see that the algorithm
which does take syntactic effects on accen
placement into account, offers a substantia
improvement over a simple algorithm based at
the content word - function word distinction.

I will use the term pitch accent or simply accent to refer to prominence caused by the presence of such an accent-lending pitch movement. Of course, the intonation model does not predict where in a sentence pitch accents or intonational boundaries will be located, but when these locations are provided as input, the model is capable of generating a natural-sounding contour. In the remainder of this paper I will deal specifically with pitch accent assignment. It is relatively standard nowadays to view accent placement as a process involving two stages (cf. Ladd, 1980; Gussenhoven, 1983; Fuchs, 1984; Baart, 1987): in the first stage it is decided which constituents of a sentence contain relatively important information (e.g. because they add new information to the background shared by speaker and hearer) and are therefore to be focussed upon; the decision to focus certain parts of a sentence and not focus other parts is based on semanticopragmatic information and in principle cannot be predicted from the lexico-syntactic structure of a sentence. In the second stage, the exact location of a pitch accent within a focussed constituent is determined; here lexi</context>

The following rule, adopted from Ladd (1980) takes care of this case. The rule makes sure that a [-focus] node is labelled w; by convention, its sister node becomes s. (6) Default Accent (DA): s —I■ w [-focus] While arguments are normally labelled s and therefore likely to receive accent, there are some cases where we do not want an argument to be accented. A case in point are [-focus] pronouns. In (7a) we have an example of a lexical object NP (een speld); in (7b) this NP is replaced by a [-focus] pronoun (iets). As a result of the DA rule, it is the particle (op) that receives the accent in (7b), instead of the object. (7a) (hij raapt</context>
