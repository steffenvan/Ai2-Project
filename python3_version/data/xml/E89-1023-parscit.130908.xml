This paper discusses the application of a
previously reported theory of explanation
rhetoric (Maybury, 1988b) to the task of
explaining constraint violations in a hybrid
rule/frame based system for resource
allocation (Dawson et al, 1987). This
research illustrates how discourse strategies
of explanation, textual connectives, and
additional justification knowledge can be
applied to enhance the cohesiveness,
structure, and clarity of knowledge based
system explanations.

INTRODUCTION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99994071875">
Recent work in text generation includes
emphasis on producing textual presentations
of the explanations of reasoning in
knowledge-based systems. Initial work
(Swartout, 1981) on the direct translation of
underlying system knowledge led to insights
that more perspicuous justifications would
result from keeping track of the principles or
deep causal models which supported that
knowledge (Swartout and Smoliar, 1988).
And experiments with discourse strategies
demonstrated the efficacy of the rhetorical
organization of knowledge to produce
descriptions, comparisons (McKeown, 1985)
and clarification (McCoy, 1985). Researchers
have recently observed (Paris et al, 1988) that
the line of explanation should not
isomorphically mirror the underlying line of
reasoning as this often resulted in poorly
connected text (Appelt, 1982). Others have
attempted to classify patterns of explanations
(Stevens and Steinberg, 1981; Schank,
1986). The approach presented here is to
exploit generic explanation strategies and
focus models (Sidner, 1983; Grosz and
Sidner, 1988) to organize the back-end
justification via an explanation rhetoric -- that
is, a rhetorical model of strategies that
humans employ to persuade, support, or
clarify their position. The result is a more
connected, flowing and thus easier to follow
textual presentation of the explanation.

KNOWLEDGE REPRESENTATION
and EXPLANATION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.991758875">
Previous research in natural language
generation from knowledge based systems
has primarily focused on independent
knowledge representation schemes (e.g rule,
frame or conceptual dependency formalisms).
In contrast, the application chosen to test the
concepts of rhetorical explanations is an FRL
(Roberts and Goldstein, 1977) based mission
planning system for the Air Force which
utilizes both rules and frames during
decision-making. Hence, the explanations
concern rule-based constraint violations
which result from inference about entities in
the knowledge base, their attributes, and
relationships. For example, if the user plans
an offensive counter air mission with an
incompatible aircraft and target, the system
will automatically signal a constraint violation
via highlighting of objects on the screen. If
the user mouses for explanation, the system
will state the conflicting rule, then list the
supporting knowledge, as shown in figure 1.

The weak textuality of the presentation
manifests itself through ungrammatical

burden of organization upon the reader.
Moreover, it lacks essential content that
specifies why an F-111E is not acceptable.

One reason the text lacks coherence is
because it fails to specify precise
relationships among introduced entities.
This can be achieved not only by sequential
order, but through the use of models of
rhetoric, textual connectives, and discourse
devices such as anaphora and pronominal
modifiers. For instance, rather than achieving
organization from some model of naturally
occurring discourse, the presentation is
isomorphic to the underlying inference chain.

AIRCRAFT-1, and the two justification types
are DATA and INHERITANCE, representing
knowledge and relationships among entities
in the FRL knowledge base. Notice that the
(AIRCRAFT OCA1002 F-111E) tuple is
followed by a lisp code test for inequality of
F-111E and F-4G aircraft. It is unclear
(indeed unspecified) in this formalism that the
reason for this test and the preference for an
F-4G is its ability to handle search radar.
Thus, discrimination of the two aircraft on
the basis of structure, function, capability or
some other characteristic would further
clarify the explanation. Therefor, there is a
need not only for linguistic processing to
enhance the coherence of the presentation in
figure 1, but also additional knowledge to
enhance the perspicuity of the explanation.

EXPLANATION RHETORIC
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999746875">
The implemented system, EXPLAN,
exploits models of rhetorical strategies, focus
models, as well as entity-distinguishing
knowledge to improve the organization,
connectivity and surface choices (e.g.
connectives and anaphor) of the text. The
system first instantiates a pool of relevant
explanation propositions from both the
explanation audit trail as well as from the
knowledge base as both are sources of
valuable clarifying information. The text
planner uses a predicate selection algorithm
(guided by a global and local focus model,
knowledge of rhetorical ordering,
relationships among entities in the knowledge
base, and the explanation audit trail) to select
and order propositions which are then
realized via a case semantics, a relational
grammar, and finally morphological
synthesis algorithms (Maybury, 1988a).
In our example, the first task is to
determine the salience of entities to the
explanation. The generator includes the
current frame (that is, the current mission
being planned, OCA1002) in the global focus
of attention. However, global focus also
must include those slots which may have
relevance to constraint violations. Figure 3
shows the OCA1002 mission frame which
has many slots, only a few of which are
central to the explanation, namely the
AIRCRAFT and TARGET slots. A selection
algorithm filters out semantically irrelevant
slots (e.g. AIO, DISPLAY) and retains slots
trapped by the constraint violation. Salient
objects in the knowledge base are marked,
including the parent and children of the
object(s) in question (which are explicitly in
focus) and the siblings or cousins of the
global focus (which are implicitly in focus).
After selecting the global focus
(OCA1002, AIRCRAFT, and TARGET),
and marking salient objects in the knowledge
base, the planner selects three propositions
from the instantiated pool guided by the local
focus model and the model of explanation
discourse. The proposition pool includes
previously reported (McKeown, 1985)
rhetorical types such as attributive,
constituent, and illustration, but also includes
a wide range of justificatory rhetorical
predicate types such as characteristic,
componential, classificatory, physical-causal,
generalization, associative, and functional, as
reported in (Maybury, 1988b).
These predicates are grouped into sub-
schema as to whether they identify the
problem, support the identification or
diagnosis, or recommend actions. These
sub-strategies, which provide global
rhetorical coherence, can expand to a range of
predicate types such as the three chosen in
the example plan. As figure 4 illustrates,
the explanation strategy is a representation of

The corresponding instantiated rhetorical
propositions are shown in figure 5. The
problem to be identified in our illustration is
that there is a conflict between the aircraft and
the target chosen in the mission plan. As this
is indicated by highlighting of these slots on
the screen, identification of the conflict is not
included in the text, although there is no
reason why this could not be explicitly stated
by means of a definition predicate. With the
problem identified, the planner justifies this
identification by characterizing the mission
under consideration and classifying the object
at the root of the constraint violation.
Finally, the planner recommends a viable
alternative using a suggestive proposition.
Notice that the discriminatory knowledge
in the suggestive predicate in figure 5
from the knowledge basel rather than the
explanation trace. Thus the knowledge
provided in the audit trail along with general
knowledge from the domain knowledge base
are abstracted into rhetorical predicates which
serve as sentential building blocks of text.
Attachment points for linguistic units (parts-
of-speech, phrases, or complete utterances)
are indicated by position in the rhetorical
formalism. Prepositional phrase selection is
guided by keywords such as function (for),

The rhetorical formalism is interpreted
with a case-frame semantics which is
translated to syntactic form via a relational
grammar. Discourse models of focus and
context as well as rhetorical force guide
syntax choices. Morphological synthesizers
(using category and feature values from the
syntax generator) together with orthographic
routines govern final surface form (see figure
6). As illustrated in the final sentence of the
paragraph, parenthetical functional

Offensive Counter Air Mission 1002 has f-111e aircraft and a target of Ludwigslusts-Alpha.

Therefore, the aircraft should be an f-4g (for radar destruction) rather than an f-1 11e (for radar

DISCUSSION

<bodyText confidence="0.99998815">
The produced text is more effective
because of explicit rhetorical organization, the
use of textual connectives (e.g. &amp;quot;therefore&amp;quot;),
and the enrichment of the explanation with
additional justificatory knowledge. An
interesting venue for further investigation, the
order and dominance relationships of figure 4
could aid in responding to user
misconceptions or follow-up questions.
These relationships could be used to tailor
rhetorical force to the type of user addressed,
hence requiring explicit user models. An
obvious weakness is the lack of goal-directed
selection of rhetorical devices to achieve
some targeted effect. In essence, pragmatic
function is implicit in the rhetorical strategies
such that effects on the hearer are achieved,
although not explicitly planned for. A
particularly enticing idea is that put forward

KNOWLEDGE REPRESENTATION and EXPLANATION Previous research in natural language generation from knowledge based systems has primarily focused on independent knowledge representation schemes (e.g rule, frame or conceptual dependency formalisms). In contrast, the application chosen to test the concepts of rhetorical explanations is an FRL (Roberts and Goldstein, 1977) based mission planning system for the Air Force which utilizes both rules and frames during decision-making. Hence, the explanations concern rule-based constraint violations which result from inference about entities in the knowledge base, their attributes, and relationships. For example, if the user plans an offensive counter air mission with an incompatible aircraft and target, the system will automatically signal a constraint violation via highlighting of objects on the screen. If the user mouses for explanation, the system will state the conflicting rule, then list the supporting knowledg</context>
