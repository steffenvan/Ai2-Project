ABSTRACT

<bodyText confidence="0.999565">
The notion of reversibility that is salient for grammars rests on the idea that grammars are trans-
ducers between strings of words and some more abstract meaning representation. The grammar
is reversible if the transducer will work in both directions. The notion was important in driving
the evolution from procedural grammar formalisms, like ATN, to declaritive formalisms, like
LFG and HPSG. The key was to replace the setting of registers with the unification of logical
variables. The aim was to base grammars entirely on &apos;monotonic&apos; operations. An issue has
arisen more recently has to with the various notions of &apos;head of a construction&apos;. After an attempt
to place reversible grammars in their historical perspective, I will discuss the relation between
monotonicty and headedness.
