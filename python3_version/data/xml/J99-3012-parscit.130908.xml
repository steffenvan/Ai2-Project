Syntax aims to unite related but often disjointedly represented areas of syntactic
inquiry together in one publication. Within a single forum Syntax accommodates both
the explosive growth and increased specialization in the field of syntax.
Syntax contains a reviewed Open Forum section which debates topical questions
concerning syntactic research. Varied discussions include historical antecedents of
current ideas; methodological, interdisciplinary and philosophical issues confronting
contemporary research and ideas; and issues for undergraduate and graduate teaching
of interdisciplinary syntax.

The MIT Press is pleased to annouce a new journal, Markup Languages: Theory and Practice.
This quarterly, peer-reviewed technical journal will be the first journal devoted to research, devel-
opment, and practical applications of text markup for computer processing, management, manipu-
lation, and display. Specific areas of interest include new syntaxes for generic markup languages;
refinements to existing markup languages; theory of formal languages as applied to document
markup; systems for mark-up; uses of markup for printing, hypertext, electronic display, content
analysis, information reuse and repurposing, search and retrieval, and interchange; shared applica-
tions of markup languages; and techniques and methodologies for developing markup languages
and applications of markup languages.

Guidelines for Submissions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.446206">
Manuscripts for Computational Linguistics should be submitted on letter-size paper (8.5 by
11 inches, or A4), double-spaced and single-sided throughout, including footnotes and refer-
ences. The paper should begin with an informative abstract of approximately 150-250 words.
Manuscripts must be written in English. Contact the editor regarding the possibility of electronic
submission.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.88389">
Submissions may be made in any of the following categories:
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.956776111111111">
Papers: This category includes contributions that report significant new research results in com-
putational linguistics or that provide critical reviews of the literature on a particular topic. The
length of a paper depends on its content, but it is suggested that manuscripts be limited to
&apos;forty double-spaced pages. That is the equivalent of thirty journal pages. Each paper is fully
refereed by three or four experts in the field. Manuscripts may also be submitted electroni-
cally; consult http://www.aclweb.org/cl/submit.txt for instructions and pointers to the LATEX
style files. The submission of an article to CL for refereeing means that the author certifies
the manuscript is not copyrighted; nor has it been published or submitted for publication to
another refereed journal. If any version of the paper has appeared, or will appear, in a non-
refereed publication, the details of such publication must be made known to the Editor at
the time of submission. The final version of a paper tentatively accepted for publication must
be accompanied by a Copyright Transfer Agreement signed by all of the authors or, in the
case of a &amp;quot;work for hire,&amp;quot; by .the employer. This written transfer is necessary under the 1978
U.S. Copyright law.
Letters to the Editor: This category includes statements of opinion on issues relevant to the
readership. The Editor and the editorial board will evaluafe the appropriateness of these con-
tributions for inclusion.
Five copies of papers or three copies of letters should be sent to:

Squibs and Discussions: This category includes short articles reporting technical results, dis-
cussions of results, algorithms, or new computational linguistic data or tools of interest to the
journal readership. Submission format is the same as for regular papers, but the length should
in no case exceed eight journal pages. Electronic submissions (LATEX source, postscript or plain
text) are welcome and should be submitted to:

Founded in 1962, the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) is the primary scientific and
professional society for natural language processing research and applications. A European chapter was
established in 1982. Besides publishing Computational Linguistics, the ACL holds international meetings
(annually in North America, biennially in Europe) where the state-of-the-art in natural language
processing research and development is presented. Recently, special interest groups on the Mathematics of
Language, the Lexicon, Parsing, Generation, Computational Phonology, Multimedia Language Processing,
and Very Large Corpora have been formed; others are likely to be added.

Contact the editor regarding the possibility of electronic submission. Submissions may be made in any of the following categories: Papers: This category includes contributions that report significant new research results in computational linguistics or that provide critical reviews of the literature on a particular topic. The length of a paper depends on its content, but it is suggested that manuscripts be limited to &apos;forty double-spaced pages. That is the equivalent of thirty journal pages. Each paper is fully refereed by three or four experts in the field. Manuscripts may also be submitted electronically; consult http://www.aclweb.org/cl/submit.txt for instructions and pointers to the LATEX style files. The submission of an article to CL for refereeing means that the author certifies the manuscript is not copyrighted; nor has it been published or submitted for publication to another refereed journal. If any version of the paper has appeared, or will appear, in a nonrefereed publication, the details of such publication must be made known to the Editor at the time of submission. The final version of a paper tentatively accepted for publication must be accompanied by a Copyright Transfer Agreement signed by all of the authors or, in the case of a &amp;quot;work for hire,&amp;quot; by .the employer. This written transfer is necessary under the 1978 U.S. Copyright law. Letters to the Editor: This category includes statements of opinion on issues relevant to the readership. The Editor and the editorial board will evaluafe the appropriateness of these contributions for inclusion. Five copies of papers or three copies of letters should be sent to:</abstract>

A European chapter was in 1982. Besides publishing Linguistics, ACL holds international meetings (annually in North America, biennially in Europe) where the state-of-the-art in natural language processing research and development is presented. Recently, special interest groups on the Mathematics of Language, the Lexicon, Parsing, Generation, Computational Phonology, Multimedia Language Processing, and Very Large Corpora have been formed; others are likely to be added.</abstract>
