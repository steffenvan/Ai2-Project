1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999401225806452">
With the increasing number of biomedical papers,
and their electronic publication in NCBI-PUBMED,
there is a growing focus on information retrieval from
texts. In particular, the recent development of proce-
dures for large-scale experiments, such as yeast-two
hybrid screening, mass spectrometry, and DNA/protein
microarrays, has brought about many changes in the
knowledge required by biologists and chemists. Because
they produce large amounts of data on genes at one time,
biologists require extensive knowledge of numerous
genes to analyze the data obtained and these are beyond
the capability of manual acquisition from the vast bio-
medical literature. Since, in many cases, the main objec-
tive of text processing is extraction of protein-
protein/gene interaction or gene function, the first prob-
lem to solve is gene/protein/compound name recogni-
tion. To date, various methods of protein/gene name
taggers have been proposed, mainly relating to Homo
sapiens. These methods can be roughly divided into
rule-based approaches (Fukuda et al. 1998), statistical
approaches, including machine learning (Collier et al.
2000, Nobata et al. 1999), dictionary/knowledge-based
approaches Humphreys et al. 2000, Jenssen et al. 2001,
Koike et al. 2003), or a combination of these approaches
(Tanabe and Wilbur, 2002). Since merely recognizing
gene/protein names is insufficient to keep the extracted
information in gene order, dictionary-based name rec-
ognition appears useful for assigning the locus of the
extracted gene/protein name. Naming conventions are
quite different for different organisms. Therefore, an
appropriate approach is required for each organism.

Abstract
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999592544117647">
Rapid advances in the biomedical field have
resulted in the accumulation of numerous ex-
perimental results, mainly in text form. To ex-
tract knowledge from biomedical papers, or
use the information they contain to interpret
experimental results, requires improved tech-
niques for retrieving information from the
biomedical literature. In many cases, since the
information is required in gene units, recogni-
tion of the named entity is the first step in
gathering and using knowledge encoded in
these papers. Dictionary-based searching is
useful for retrieving biological information in
gene units. However, since many genes in the
biomedical literature are written using am-
biguous names, such as family names, we
need a way of constructing dictionaries. In our
laboratory, we have developed a gene name
dictionary:GENA and a family name diction-
ary. The latter contains ambiguous hierarchi-
cal gene names to compensate GENA. In
addition, to address the problem of trivial
gene name variations and polysemy, heuristics
were used to search gene/protein/family
names in MEDLINE abstracts. Using these
algorithms to match dictionary and
gene/protein/family names, about 95, 91, and
89% of protein/gene/family names in abstracts
on Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Drosophila
melanogaster, and Homo sapiens were de-
tected with a precision of 96, 92, and 94%, in
respective organisms. The effect of our
gene/protein/family recognition method on
protein-interaction and protein-function ex-
There are three main problems in dictionary-based
searching: (1) the existence of multi-sense words; (2)
variations in gene names; and (3) the existence of am-
biguous names. The first problem is mainly seen in
symbol (abbreviated) types. For example, HAC1 is a
synonym for both “tripartite motif-containing 3” and
“hyperpolarization activated cyclic nucleotide-gated
potassium channel 2” in H. sapiens. Further, some gene
names, especially in Drosophila melanogaster, have the
same spelling with verb(lack, ...), adjective(white, yel-
low...), common nouns (spot, twin, ...), and prepositions
(of, ...). The second problem is trivial variations in gene
names (orthographical, morphological, syntactic, lexico-
semantic, insertion/deletion, permutation, or pragmatic).
For example, “mitogen-activated protein kinase 1” and
“protein kinase mitogen-activated, 1”, “NIK ser-
ine/threonine protein kinase”, and “NIK protein kinase”
indicate the same gene. The third problem is caused by
ambiguous expression of the gene name in the text. The
problems of multi-sense words and the ambiguity are
well summarized by Tuason et al. (2004)
In many cases, the family name is used instead of
the gene name. A unique gene locus may not have been
specified, especially for genes with multiple paralogs, or
to avoid repeating the same expression, the family name
may frequently be used. For example, in 1996, the “14-
3-3” family name was counted 107 times in abstracts
using mesh terms for human, while “14-3-3 alpha, beta,
delta, gamma” gene name expressions did not appear at
all. Thus, a family name dictionary is also required
along with a gene name dictionary to specify the gene
locus or loci. In this study, the above-mentioned prob-
lems were, as far as possible, solved simply using heu-
ristics.

pombe, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis ele-
gans, Drosophila melanogaster, Mus musculus, Rattus
norvegicus, and Homo sapiens, respectively. A merge of
each database entry was done using the ‘official sym-
bol’ or ORF name and link data provided by each entry
and the protein-sequence data entry. The priority of the
database was given in advance. For example, in H.
sapiens, HUGO, Locuslink, GDB, and GenAtlas were
registered in this order, using the merged entry for the
same ‘official symbol’. LocusLink’s ‘preferred symbol’,
which is not yet administered by HUGO, was also used.
Merging the entries in SWISS-PROT, TrEMBL, and
these registered data was done using the link data for
‘Genew’ provided by SWISS-PROT and TrEMBL. The
rest of the entries were merged using the protein-IDs for
LocusLink, SWISS-PROT, and TrEMBL. For example,
LocusLink provides unique representative mRNA and
protein sequences, and related sequences belonging to
the same gene. If the protein-sequence entry for SWISS-
PROT and TrEMBL matched with any of these se-
quence entries for LocusLink, the entries were merged.
Linking these registered data with the PIR entries was
also done using protein-ID entries. In principle, for all
organisms, protein sequences without ‘official or pre-
ferred symbols’ were not registered. The entries con-
sisted of ‘official symbols’ and ‘official full names’,
which were provided by representative institutions, such
as HUGO, for each organism, and ‘synonyms’ and
‘gene products’. S. cerevisiae and C. elegans do not
have ‘official full names’. The distinction between these
elements of each ‘name’ simply depends on the ‘item
headings’ for each database. Although gene names and
their product names are registered separately for one
locus, and whether the entry’s product is protein or
RNA is also registered in GENA, we do not distinguish
between them here. Hereafter, we do not distinguish
‘gene product’ from the gene name ‘synonym’. Unfor-
tunately, databases contain numerous mistakes or inap-
propriate gene/protein names. The reliability of each
synonym was judged according to the database source.
To meet our information extraction purposes, only gene
names over a certain reliability can be used. Meaning-
less names (ex. hypothetical protein), higher concept
names (ex. membrane protein) and apparently wrong
names (ex. OK ) were removed from the data semi-
automatically using word-net vocabularies and term
frequencies of all abstracts of one year. In an evaluation
of this study, synonym names entered only in TrEMBL
or PIR, except for names manually checked in our labo-
ratory, were removed due to their low reliability.
In addition to these data, we added synonym names
using the following methods. (1) Abbreviations of
synonyms were added using an abbreviation extraction
algorithm (Schwartz and Hears, 2003). (2) Plausible
gene names were extracted from the subject and object
noun of some verbs, which restricted such subjects and
objects as ‘phosphorylate’ and ‘methylate’ (both sub-
jects must be protein/gene/family names). These are by-
products of protein-interaction extraction in our project.
The corresponding ‘official symbol’ was searched using
a partial match of registered names, and finally was
checked manually.
Compound names were gathered from the index of
the biochemical dictionary, KEGG
(http://www.genome.ad.jp/kegg/kegg2.html), mesh
terms, and UMLS
(http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/) and were reg-
istered in GENA. Some high-concept terms were re-
moved manually. Compound name searches were not
evaluated in this study. Currently (January, 2004), it
contains about 920,000 registered gene/protein names
and 210,000 compound names.
GENA was managed using Postgres, which pro-
vides command line searching and Web searching
(http://www.gena.ontology.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp). Searches
can be done considering the word order replacement of
long gene names using indexing all words consisting
names.

3 Construction of family name dictionary
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999985117647059">
The construction of the family name dictionary was
done using SWISS-PROT family names, PIR family
names, INTERPRO family names
(http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/), gene/protein names in
GENA, and clustering sequence similarities. These have
hierarchical named entities. For example, “MAPK1” is
a member of the “MAPK family” and the “MAPK fam-
ily” is a member of the family of the “Ser/Thr protein
kinase family”; in turn, this family is a member of “pro-
tein kinase”, and “protein kinase” is a type of “kinase”.
Although “family” is usually used to indicate “similar
sequence groups that probably have the same origin”,
sometimes it is also used to mean “sequence groups that
have almost the same function”. In this paper, we use
“family” as “ambiguous gene/protein names that indi-
cate similar sequences or biological functions”. Plausi-
ble family names based on gene names are the common
parts of multiple gene names, such as “MAPK” of
“MAPK[number]”, “14-3-3” of “14-3-3 [Greek alpha-
bet[alpha-delta/alphabet[a-d]]”, “protein kinase” of
“Tyr protein kinase” and “Ser/Thr protein kinase”, and
“kinase” of “Inositol kinase” and “protein kinase”. The
backbone of the family hierarchy was constructed based
on the INTERPRO family hierarchy. As far as possible,
the remaining hierarchy was manually constructed con-
sidering sequence similarities, using Markov clustering
(Enright et al. 2002) based on all-versus-all blast. The
hierarchy has a directed acyclic graph structure. The
family names are across organims and the family name
dictionary is common to each organism. The family
database is available from http://marine.ims.u-
tokyo.ac.jp:8080/Dict/family. Currently (January, 2004),
it contains about 16,000 entries and 70,000 registered
names.

4 Gene/protein/family name searches us-
ing a devised trie
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999696">
A gene/protein/family name search of texts was car-
ried out using a devised trie for faster gene name search-
ing. The trie was provided for each organism separately.
The core terms implemented for the trie were generated
based on GENA. Here, the following main heuristics
were used.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.961938363636364">
(1) Special characters are replaced by a space.
(2) In principle, both numerical and Roman numer-
als are prepared.
(3) The space before a numerical number is removed.
However, if the previous character before the space is a
number, the space is not removed (e.g., 14-3-3 is “14 3
3”).
(4) With space and without space terms are used for
‘Greek alphabet and alphabet a/A, b/B, c/C, ...’. For
example, “14 3 3 alpha, 14 3 3alpha, 14 3 3 a, 14 3 3a”.
(5) Common words at the end of gene names, such
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.90432003125">
as “protein”, “gene”, “sub-family”, “family”, and
“group”, are removed. However, if the meaning of
names is changed with/without these words, they are
left. For example, “T-cell surface protein” indicates
“protein on the T-cell surface”, while “T-cell surface”
usually indicates “the surface of the T-cell”, and remov-
ing “protein” from “memory-related protein” causes
faulty recognition of “memory-related function” as
‘memory related /gene-name’ ’function’. When “pro-
tein”, “gene”, “sub-family”, “group”, and “family” ap-
pear within gene names, gene words with and without
these words are generated.
(6) For symbol-type names (less than seven charac-
ters), the initial of the organism is added to the spelt-out
type. For example, in MAPK1 for H. sapiens, hMAPK1
and h MAPK1 are used. For S. cerevisiae, the protein
name is generated by adding “p” at the end of the name.
For example, the protein of STE7 is STE7p. For muta-
tions of D. melanogaster, + added names are used. For
example, lt+ for lt.
(7) All names are converted into small characters
and plurals are also generated. Some names are “case
sensitive” and some require “all capital letters”. In prin-
ciple, when the name is the common spelling of a
“common noun, adverb, or adjective”, “all capital letter
names” are adopted in H. sapiens, M. musculus, and R.
norvegicus (using “word net vocabularies” with less
than five characters. Word length is limited to remove
words that happen to have the same spelling but without
removing biological names registered in the word net).
“All capital letters names” were recognized in the trie.
Case-sensitive words such as cAMP and CAMP were
selected experientially and checked after the trie search.
Since many of Drosophila melanogaster genes have the
same spelling with verb, adjective, common nouns, and
preposition. These gene names are replaced by “gene
name + specified names” using word-net vocabularies
to decrease false positive. For example, the gene name
“yellow” is replaced by “yellow locus”, “yellow gene”,
“yellow protein”, “yellow allele”... etc.
The trie search starts from the next characters after a
“space”, “-”, “/”, or “period” or the head of sentence.
When multiple gene names are hit in duplicate, the
longest name ID is outputted. When specific terms, such
as “antagonist”, “receptor”, “cell”, and “inhibi-
tor”, ....are next to the gene name, the hit gene name ID
is not outputted, since these indicate different
gene/protein names or are not gene/protein names. Also,
when terms such as “promoter” and “mutant” are lo-
cated next to the gene name, they do not show the
gene/protein/family themselves. However, for our pur-
poses of extracting the genetic interaction, they are
treated the same as gene/protein/family names. Specific
terms such as “number” are located before the gene
name and the hit gene name ID is not outputted since
they are multi-sense words and, in most cases, are not
gene/protein names. Parentheses are also specially
treated, so “mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK)
1” --&gt; is recognized as “mitogen activated protein
kinase 1 (MAPK1)”. The continuous gene description
such as “GATA-4/5/6” is also specially treated as
shown in Figure 1. If the gene names are synonyms of
multi-genes, the multiple gene IDs are outputted in this
stage.

5 Resolving multi sense words
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.986595181818182">
To resolve the problem of multi-sense words, we
used information from the whole text. When the hit
name is shorter than a certain gene name length (seven
characters for H. sapiens; the length is different for each
organism), there is a possibility that the hit name is an
abbreviation of another word (not only gene names, but
also an experimental method or name of an apparatus).
To avoid false-positive words as far as possible, we
used the following heuristics in M. musculus, R.
norvegicus, and H. sapiens.
1) If the corresponding full name, or a name longer
than six characters, is written in the same abstract,
the hit gene ID is used.
When the full name and abbreviation pairs are writ-
ten in the abstract as “plausible full name (the hit
name)” or “plausible full name [the hit name]”, the fol-
lowing procedures are carried out.
2) If the full/long name is a complete match for the
synonyms or full name of the corresponding ID, the hit
gene ID is used.
3) If the full/long name is not a complete match for
these corresponding IDs using the abbreviation extrac-
tion algorithm (Schwartz and Hearst, 2003), but its
spelling consists of words used in any name of the cor-
responding ID, the hit ID is adopted. If not, the hit ID is
discarded (i.e., the full/long name considering the re-
placement of the word order).
4) If information on full names or long names is not
found in the abstract, a key-word search of all the ab-
stracts is carried out. If at least one key word is detected,
the ID is used.
The summary of these steps were shown in Figure 2.
(The numbers in Fig.2 correspond to the above head
numbers.)
However, treatment (2) is not sufficient in some cases
because some abbreviations are written only once for
one family kind. For example, in PUBMED-ID
8248212, ...”the recently described TAP (transporter
associated with antigen processing) genes have been
mapped approximately midway between DP and DQ. ...
In addition to the alleles of TAP1 that have been de-
scribed, others were identified during this study.”
“TAP1” is the synonym for “transporter 1, ATP-binding
cassette, sub-family B (MDR/TAP)”, and “transient
receptor potential cation channel, subfamily C, member
4 associated protein.” In most cases, the full name is
written only once for the same family. In this case, the
former (“transporter 1, ATP-binding cassette, sub-
family B (MDR/TAP)”) is correct. Accordingly, the full
name and abbreviation pair “TAP” without the number
is also checked. Since all vocabularies (“transporter”,
“associated”, “antigen”, “processing”) are components
of synonyms of TAP1, the TAP1 is recognized by
“transporter 1, ATP-binding cassette, and sub-family B
(MDR/TAP)”. In considering syntactic variations, some

prepositions such as “of” and “with”, and frequently
used words such as “sub-family” and “family”, are
skipped in this process. Further regarding the lexico-
semantic pattern, as far as possible, adjectives and
nouns are provided for each vocabulary using word-net
vocabularies and UMLS.

<bodyText confidence="0.999590714285714">
With this treatment, only when pairs of full names, or
close to the full name, and abbreviations appear, the
distinctions between some synonyms are completed. In
some cases, the name belongs to the same family. For
example, LRE2 is a synonym for “LINE retrotranspos-
able element 2” and “LINE retrotransposable element
3”. In this case, the distinction between them is very
fine and seems unimportant. In some abstracts, full
names are not written in the text. To resolve this issue,
we used key words for each gene, which were selected
from all words/terms (continuous words) composing
synonym names and their family names as shown in the
procedures in (4). When at least one keyword is de-
tected, the ID is accepted. The key words appear less
than 50 times (only for words extracted from gene
names, in the case of words from family name, this limi-
tation is not used) in genes and appear less than a cer-
tain frequency in all abstracts and are not common to
different genes that have synonyms with the same spell-
ing. Even if a key word search is performed, except for
famous names such as p53 and p38, the locus identifica-
tion for “# kDa”, meaning a “#p” expression such as
p60 and p61, is quite difficult. In relation to famous
name-Ids, such as cAMP(cyclic AMP), CD2(cluster
designation 2), the IDs are used to recover a false nega-
tive even if the full/longer name is not written in the
abstracts and the keywords are not detected.
The automatic keyword selection using conventional
methods such as tf-idf (Salton and Yang, 1973) and
SMART (Singhal et al. 1996) may be applicable. How-
ever, the number of abstracts per gene is too small in
many cases and the effective keywords selection could
not be achieved. Therefore, this approach was not ap-
plied, in this study.
For S. cerevisiae, C. elegans, and D. melanogaster, in
most cases, the full names of symbols are not written.
Only when the symbol name has a symbol (abbrevia-
tion)-full name pairs, and the full name is not the corre-
sponding gene name or contains a word that is not a
component of the synonyms, the hit-ID is discarded.
Although, as far as possible, we removed what we as-
sumed were wrong or inappropriate gene names, some
names either do not seem to be synonyms or are rarely
used ones. These can cause errors. For example, LPS is
a synonym for “interferon regulatory factor 6” (for ex-
ample, LocusLink, GenAtlas) and “lipopolysaccharide”
in H. sapiens. However, our investigations indicate that
LPS is not used to indicate “interferon regulatory factor
6” in abstracts.

In judging family name recognition, slightly soft cri-
teria were used. If a complete matching entry was not
registered in the family name dictionary, a higher con-
cept ID was assigned. For example, “lactate dehydro-
genase” was not registered in the family name
dictionary, so this name was assigned the ID “dehydro-
genase”. Even if the other organisms are written in the
same abstracts, their gene names are not extracted in
principle. However, human, rat, and mouse are not dis-
tinguished in this validation. The family names in other
organisms are also extracted in this evaluation.
As shown in Table 2, in all organisms, more than
one-third of the gene names were written as family
names. This indicates the necessity for hierarchical gene
names, as in the family dictionary, although conven-
tional methods scarcely mentioned. The recall and pre-
cision of these organisms as shown in Table 1 are
relatively high roughly compared to previous reports.

viewed by Hirschman 2002). The details of errors were
as followings. Only 4 and 1 names, which were regis-
tered in GENA and family name dictionary, were rec-
ognized as gene/family names at once, but they were
erroneously discarded by the procedures used to con-
firm ambiguous names, in H. sapiens. Many of them are
caused by the key-word search fails. Especially, in fam-
ily names, the key-words seem to be insufficient.
Probably, these will be addressed in some extent by use
of the key words of the higher/lower concept IDs. In
some cases, the full-name and abbreviation match failed.
For example, in “urokinase-type plasminogen activator
receptor (uPAR, CD87)”, the full-name and abbrevia-
tion match failed due to the existence of “two names” in
the parenthesis. These errors will be recovered by the
keyword search. However, in the present program, re-
covering step is not used. The recall of family names in
H. sapiens is slightly low because of varieties of fami-
lies as shown in Table 1. 6, 4 names were false positive
gene/protein names in S. cerevisiae and H. sapiens, re-
spectively. 7, 5 names were false positive family names
in S. cerevisiae and H. sapien, respectively. Most of
them were short names and were not removed due to
their in-appropriate keywords. Some of them are
caused by inappropriate GENA entries.
In relation to D. melanogaster, 10 gene/protein
names that were registered in GENA were not recog-
nized as gene/family names. Many of them were general
nouns/adjective and were not used as the “gene name +
specified words” phrase in the abstracts. Rest of them
were gene/protein names removed in trie implementa-
tion steps due to their confusing spellings such as “10-
4”. Also mutant gene name recognition was quite diffi-
cult in this method, since the superscript for the muta-
tion was converted in the normal characters in NCBI-
abstracts and newly developed mutant was expressed by
changing the superscript. 4 family names were recog-
nized once and erroneously discarded in the keyword
search steps. 31 gene/protein names and 12 family
names were false positive. Most of them in gene/protein
names were misleading names such as 19A. These mis-
leading names were removed or replaced by the “gene
name + specified words” phrase as far as possible with
some heuristics and term frequencies in abstracts. How-
ever, some remained. Some false positive were wrongly
extracted other organisms’ gene names.
In the strict criteria of family name recognition, 10,
18, 10 names were recognized as higher concepts in H.
sapiens, D. melanogaster, and S.cerevisiae, respectively.
The registration of detailed entries for the family name
dictionary is required.
The heuristics of the name detection seem to be suf-
ficient so that no name detections failed due to trivial
name variations in H. sapiens and S. cerevisiae, and
only one name in D. melanogaster except mutant varia-
tion failed. There is some room to be improved in ambi-
guity resolution steps using sophisticated keyword
searching.
In our laboratory, protein interaction information and
protein function were automatically extracted and stored
in PRIME (http://prime.ontology.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp) and
in the protein kinase database
(http://kinasedb.ontology.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp, Koike et al.,
2003). With this procedure, some false positives were
not extracted since the phrase patterns did not match the
extracted protein interaction and protein function. That
is, some wrongly recognized names were removed as a
result of considering the local context. In this stage, the
wrongly recognized false positive names was 0, 4, and 3
for S. cerevisiae, D. melanogaster, and H. sapiens, re-
spectively. Using the family name dictionary greatly
increased the recognition of ambiguous names. How-
ever, a new difficulty was found in extracting informa-
tion. Many family names are common to functional
nouns. Therefore, even if a phrase pattern is used, the
wrong interaction may be extracted. For example, from

The second problem is trivial variations in gene names (orthographical, morphological, syntactic, lexicosemantic, insertion/deletion, permutation, or pragmatic). For example, “mitogen-activated protein kinase 1” and “protein kinase mitogen-activated, 1”, “NIK serine/threonine protein kinase”, and “NIK protein kinase” indicate the same gene. The third problem is caused by ambiguous expression of the gene name in the text. The problems of multi-sense words and the ambiguity are well summarized by Tuason et al. (2004) In many cases, the family name is used instead of the gene name. A unique gene locus may not have been specified, especially for genes with multiple paralogs, or to avoid repeating the same expression, the family name may frequently be used. For example, in 1996, the “14- 3-3” family name was counted 107 times in abstracts using mesh terms for human, while “14-3-3 alpha, beta, delta, gamma” gene name expressions did not appear at all. Thus, a family name dictionary is also required along with a gene name dictionary to specify the gene locus or loci. In this study, the above-mentioned problems</context>
