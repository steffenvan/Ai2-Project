The following table summarizes the responses to
the four questions included in the survey. Here, too, it
can be seen that respondents were very positive to the
idea of a primarily hard-copy publication.
No
Question Yes No Ans.
Would AJCL be read more? 72% 2% 26%
Would submissions increase? 56% 8% 36%
Would you elect to receive HC? 63% 18% 19%
Should dues depend on form? 47% 17% 36%
The responses were also tabulated separately for the
U.S., Canada, and the other countries, but the results
did not differ significantly from the combined results
shown. About 35 additional responses were received
after the meeting, but it was apparent from looking at
them carefully that they would not significantly affect
the results already tabulated.

The 17th Annual Meeting of the Association for
Computational Linguistics was held at the University
of California at San Diego, in La Jolla, California, on
the weekend of August 11-12, 1979. The program
committee for the meeting consisted of Norm Sond-
heimer (Chairman), Barbara Sangster, Bonnie Lynn
Webber, and Ralph Weischedel, and the local arrange-
ments chairman was Jim Levin. The 24 papers listed
below were presented there. Copies of the proceed-
ings, which includes the full text of most of these pa-
pers and extended abstracts of the others, along with
an introduction to each session by its chairperson, are
available for $5 from Don Walker at the address given
on the inside front cover of this issue.
