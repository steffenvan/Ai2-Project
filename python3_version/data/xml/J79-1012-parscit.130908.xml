Yerkish, the language describ6d in this paper, was designed for
the purpose of exploring the extent to which non-huMan organisms (e.g.
great apes) could be brought to acquire linguistic skills. First
attempts at teaching a spoken language to non-human primates had failed,
apOrently because oi tl,e animals&apos; incapacity vocally to produce the
phonemes of a natural language. Subsequent work (Gardner &amp; Gardner, 1971;
Premack, 1971) demonstrated that communication could be achieved by means
of visual signs or symbols.
Yerkish is a visual language with a lexicon of graphic word Symbols
(lexigrams), each of which is a combination of discree recursive&apos;design
elements. Each lexigram is represented on one of 125 keys of a keyboard.
Sentences are formed by pressing keys in successive order. Sentence
length, at present, is limited to seven lexigrams. Input from the
keyboard is monitored and recorded by a computer that, contains in its
core the lexicon, a parser, and certain response capabilities.
The grammar is strictly interpretive and was derived from the
&apos;correlational&apos; system implemented in the lAiltistore parser for English
sentences (von Glasersfeld.&amp; Pisani, 1970). The parser works on the
basis of essentially non-linguistic classifications of items and
relational concepts (tables of the operational classes are provided in
this paper). It produces a structural analysis in terms of immediate
constituents. If an input string yields one comprehensive structure,
the string is deemed grammatical. The first lexigram functions as a
sentence marker indicating the mood of the utterance: affirmative,
negative, interrogative, and imperative, in the case of certain

requests (imperatives), the computer activates methanical devices that
fulfil the request (dispensing food, drink, toys, playing music or a
movie, etc.) Given this response capability, a 24-hour learning situation
is created in which there is always some potential incentive for the
animal to use linguistic communication.
Yerkish lexigrams and sentences are easily translated into English,
but setantics and sentence structure are somewhat restricted. Lexigrams
always have only one meaning of the corresponding English word, and
the rules for their concatenation were designee to reduce ambiguities to
a minimum.
The paper explains deviations from English grammar by means of
structural diagrams and demonstrates that, in spite of the many simpli
fications, Yerkish allows for embedded clauses and is, indeed, capable
of expansion in many directions.
Three examples of &apos;conversations&apos; with the young female chimpanzee
that is being taught the use of Yerkish are added as an appendix to
the paper.

There are .several reasons why it would be cumbersome and even some-
what misleading to organize a description of the language used in our
communication study with non-human primates, according to the linguist&apos;s
traditional pattern, in three more or less independent sections dealing,
respectively, with grammar, lexicon,. and semantics. Yerkish is an
artificial language that was designed for a specific and peculiar purpose
to explore to what extent apparently non-linguistic organisms could
acquire linguistic skills if they were placed in an environment in
which the use of linguistic communication would be to their advantage.
Being an artificial language, the design of Yerkish was subject to
constraints that are rather different from those that may or may not
have impinged upon the development of natural languages. Computational

linguists will, I am sure, agree that natural languages would have
different grammars and different interpretive rules if, from the very
beginning of their evolution, they had had to be intelligible to a
computer. And that is what Yerkish had to be. For reasons that will
become clear when we discuss the research background of the project,
the introduction of a computer as monitor of the communication system
was one of the salient feature of this research effort (Rumbaugh et al.,
1973a).
Other constraints in the development of the Yerkish language will be
discussed at those points in the exposition where their explication
seemed most appropriate. I have tried to concentrate specific aspects
under indicative subtitles. I have no illusions that this has been
wholly successful. My main goal, however, was to give the reader as
complete as possible a picture, not only of what was done, but also of
why it was done. The instrumental aspect of Yerkish as the linguistic
vehicle in an experimental communication study must be kept in mind at
all times; much of what follows in these pages can make sense only if it
is put into that perspective.
Another point that I should like to stress is that the artificial
language on which this paper reports is only one of several major
efforts that made this communication study possible. Such success as we
have had is the result of team work in the fullest sense of that term.
The project would never have got off the ground if it had not been for
the &amp;quot;continuouspatient collaboration Of seven rather heterogeneous specia-
lists from three different institutions (see footnote 1) and, last but
not least, for the perseverance of our female chimpanzee Lana. (Fig.

Background
Yerkish is a visual language of graphic word-symbols, designed for
research in communication with non-human primates and, possibly, as a
substitute vehicle for humans who, for physiological reasons, -could not
acquire a spoken language. Lieberman(1968), on the basis of anatomical
investigations, -came to the conclusion that the vocal apparatus of the
great apes precludes the production and modulation of many of the
phonemes that make up the repertoire of human languages. Forty years
earlier, Robert Yerkes (1925), the founder of the first primatological
research institute, in whose honor we have named our language, had
already observed this vocal handicap of the Tion-human primates. In the
intervening years, the failure of several long-term efforts to teach a
chimpanzee English, Japanese, or Russian, empirically confirmed his
observation (for a review, cf. Floog and Melnechuk, 1971).
The fact, however, that the great apeas are barred from speak„ing
a language does not necessarily mean that they could not understand one,
nor that they could not learn to use a lingUistic communication system
that functions in another sensory modality. There still are, of course,
scholars who, defining &amp;quot;language&amp;quot; from a rather anthropocentric point of
view, refuse to allow the term for any communication system that does not
use the vocal-auditory mode of transmission. Among other things, this
would mean that programming languages and other silent communication
systems could never be called language, no matter how adequately they
might be described in terms of lexicon, syntax, and semantics. Today,
there seems to be a growing consensus that this restriction of &amp;quot;language&amp;quot;
9
to acoustic systems is not a scientifically necessary or useful one
(Ploog and Melnechuck, 1971: 640; Lyons, 1972: 64). Interest, thus,
has shifted from the question whether or not other organisms can learn
to speak a language, to the question whether or not they can learn to
handle a communication system that is linguistic in its structure.
Given that there seems to be no compelling evidence that any non-
human species on this earth has, in fact, developed a communication
system that could legitimately be called &amp;quot;language&amp;quot;, one might be
inclined to think that attemts to teach a language to a non-human
organism are necessarilyooatetii tie- rail.fail. This conclusion, however,
would be quite unwarranted. Animal trainers in circuses and in the
laboratory have shown beyond all doubt that many species have a potential
for the acquisition of skills which no one, who observed the species
in the wild, would suspect. The fact is that the behaviors an
organism manifests in a given environment constitute under all circum-
stances only a subset of the behaviors which the organism could acquire
in different environments (Lorenz, 1974). In the area of cognitive
skills, for instance, Kohler&apos;s investigations (1925) already indicated
that the great apes had been drastically underrated. Since then, and
up to the demonstration of &amp;quot;higher mental functions&amp;quot; by Viki (Hayes
and Nissen, 1956/1971), especially the chimpanzee&apos;s intellectual
reputation has continuously groWn (Pumbaugh, 1970). Thus it has, indeed,
become more and more pertinent to ask just how far a chimpanzee (or other
great ape) could be brought in the acquisition of linguistic skills
which do not require vocal speech.
The success of the Gardners (1969, 1971) with their chimpanzee Washoe
</bodyText>

is so well known that there is no need to reiterate the description of
their pioneering work. Using American Sign Language (ASL) as a vehicle,
they established irrefutably that an infant chimpanzee can be taught to
communicate very effectively; and there would seem to be no reason why,
given a conducive environment, Washoe&apos;s communicatory skill should not
continue to grow as she develops towards intellectual maturity.
It has been repeatedly objected, however, that Washoe&apos;s successful
communications are as yet no proof that she has acquired &amp;quot;language&amp;quot;
(e.g. Lenneberg, 1971; Brown, 1971). Most of the skepticism about
Washoe&apos;s linguistic accomplishments is based on the argument that the
strings of signs she produced do not manifest syntactic competence.
When Washoe was introduced to ASL, no rigid rules of sign-order were
observgd and the relational semantics (which, for instance in English,
is taken care of to a large extent by word-order) was left implicit in
the communicatory event and had to be intuitively gleaned from the
situational context by the observer (Gardner and Gardner, 1971). Since
a language user&apos;s compliance with the syntactic rules of the language
is an important criterion in the evaluation of his linguistic performance,
the apparent lack of such rules in ASL made it a priori questionable
whether Washoe&apos;s or, indeed, any other ASL-user&apos;s stringing together of
signs could be considered syntactic and thus evidence of &amp;quot;language&amp;quot; on
the theoretical level. In addition to that, a rack of syntactic rules
is the- very reason why Washoe&apos;s ,cvnmunications could not contain many
relational indications. For instance, since the sign system taught to
Washoe had no consistent means for designating actor and patient in
activity situations (comparable to, say, the subject-verb-object sequence
</bodyText>

in many natural languages), the assignation of these roles was left
to the intuition or the common sense of the receiver.
In retrospect it is easy to see that this relative lack of syntactic
rigidity would supply critics with arguments that. tend to diminish
claims with regard to Washoe&apos;s linguistic competence. On the other
hand, it is equally clear that the Gardners,. when they started on
their splendid enterprise., were concerned above all with the formidable
task of establishing a viable form of communication with a chimpanzee,
and they could not possibly have foreseen all the theoretical reasons
why linguists and philosophers of language might doubt that the
communication system they chose, and the way ashoe was going ho use
it, should be called &amp;quot;linguistic&amp;quot;. Hence I should like to emphasize
that my attempt to clarify the syntactic problem is in no way intended
as a criticism of the work accomplished with Washoe, but solely to
throw some light on the several ways in which our project, started a
few years &apos;rater, was able to benefit from the Gardners&apos; effort.
The Communitation Facility
The basic idea of our project at the Yerkes Primate Research Center
was the introduction of a computer as a thoroughly objective monitor of
all linguistic transactions. This solved several problems at once. In
the first.place, it eliminated the problem of subjective or intuitive
evaluation of the grammatical correctness of the experimental animal&apos;s
linguistic products. Incorporating a reduced and suitably adapted
Multistore Parser (von Glasersfeld and Pisani, 1970), the computer can
&amp;quot;objectively&amp;quot; judge grammaticality. An input string either conforms to
12
legitimate syntactic structure, Or it does not. There cannot be any
doubt either way. Second, the computer has no difficulty in recording
every input and transaction that takes place, be it grammatical or not.
Third, thanks to the computer, the communication facility can be kept
in operation twenty-four hours a day, without the forbidding cost of
several shifts of techinicians and-observers.
In order to turn the communication facility into a learning
environment that could at least to some extent operate without the
presence of a.human a system of automatic responses was implemented.
By activating one of a set of machine-commanded dispensers, the computer
can satisfy a number of requests, provided these requests are correctly
formulated by the experimental animal. So far, the automatic responses
are limited to the dispensing of various foods and drinks, to opening
and shutting g window., activating a movie and a slide projector as
well as a tape player. In the future we hope to add something of a
question-answering system in order to enable the computer to respond
verbally to some questions and, perhaps, also to give some feedback with
regard to errors made in the subject&apos;s linguistic input.
A full description of the communication facility, as it is in oper-
atkon at present, has been published elsewhere (Rumbaugh et al., 1973a).
Here we shall be mainly concerned with the Yerkish language. A quick
survey of the main components of the installation will have to suffice.
Input to the system is effected by means of a keyboard of maximally
125 keys, arranged in vertical panels of 25 each. Four such panels are
in use at present, corresponding to a total of 100 keys. Each key
represents one lexigram, i.e., a geometrical design which constitutes
13
a word-symbol (lexical item) of the Yerkish language. Depression of
a key activates the corresponding item in the computerized lexicon
which is permanently incorporated in the Multistore parser. The spatial
arrangement of the lexigrams in thee keyboard can be easily reshuffled
(to prevent the experimental animal from acquiring a fixed motor pattern).
To switch on the system, a horizontal bar, mounted well above the
keyboard; has to be pulled down. The bar has to be held down continuously
throughout the input of a message. Lana, the female infant thimpanzee
with whom we have been working, does this by hanging on to the bar with
one hand while using the other to press keys. If the system is switched
on and several keys are then pressed in succession, ending with the
&amp;quot;period&amp;quot; key (the &amp;quot;end-of-message&amp;quot; signal for the computer), the parser
takes this spring as a-&amp;quot;sentence&amp;quot; and analyzes it in order to establish
whether or not is is grammatitally correct. If the input string is a
grammatically correct request, the machine also determines the object
of the request and, if it is within the range of automated responses,
satisfies the request by activating the relevant dispenser or mechanism.
Regardless of the outcove of the grammatical analysis, the machine
prints out the English.word corresponding to each lexigram that has
been activated and records; at the end of the string, whether or not it
was found to be correct.
Directly above the keyboard in the experimental chamber, there is a
row of seven&apos; small projectors in which the geometric designs of the
lexigrams appear, one by one from left to right, as their keys are
being pressed on the keyboard. This provides Lana with feedback as to
the part of the message that has already been typed in, and also with a
14
linear representation of the string she is composing. A signal light,
on the right of the projectors, lights up when the &amp;quot;period&amp;quot; key has been
pressed and terminates the message.
Above this first row of projectors there is a second similar one
which serves to display messages that are seqt in to Lana from a second
keyboard in the technician&apos;s station outside liana&apos;s chamber. Messages
originating from thetechnician&apos;s keyboard are also recorded h? the
computer, but they are marked by a code Symbol as &amp;quot;operator&apos;s messages&amp;quot;
and cannot be confounded With Lana&apos;s linguistic production.
The Yefkish Lexigrams
The original constraints under which the Yerkish language was to
be designed were essentially three.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.922171">
1) Drawing on the experience of the Cardners (1969, 1971) and Premack
(1971), Yerkish had to be a visual language with a lexicon of
unitary word-symbols that could be represented singly on the keys
of a keyboard.
2) Both lexical items and sentence structure were to be as univocal as
possible, because this, on the one hand, would facilitate the
automatic parsing of input and, on the other, it was expected to
make acquisition of the language easier for our subjects.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.983769692982456">
The structure of Yerkish was to be close enough to English to
allow word-by-word translation, in order to make participation in
communication-events, as well as their evaluation, maximally ac-
cessible to technicians and observers.
For a few weeks at the very- outset of the enterprise, the author
revelled in dreams of an ideal language in which each&apos; word was, to be
15
composed of semantically significant pleremes (Hockett, 1961). There
were to be individual design elements designating the more important
recurrent semantic categories, and each concept available in the Yerkish
universe of discourse was to be represented by a lexigram (i.e. the
visual/graphic counterparts to words in spoken languages) composed of
design elements which, in their own right, would designate the major
semantic categories to which the concept belonged. Thus, for instance,
as the American Indian language Yuchi (Crawford, 1973) has a morpheme that
recurs. in any word that designates a part of the human body, every Yerkish
lexigram designating a part of the primate body would have contained
a specific design element. Given that the Yerkish lexicon was, in any
case, to contain no more than two or three hundred lexigrams, it
seemed feasible to cover at least the major semantic categories with a
hundred or so design elements. The reason for doing this was, of course,
that such a language would have been an invaluable instrument for testing
our subject&apos;s classificatory skill and processes of concept formation.
The dream was soon Shattered by technical restrictions. The feedback
projectors above the keyboard had to be such that each one of them could
display every lexigram of the language. Within our budget, this could be
achieved only if all lexigrams were designed in such a way that they could
be generated by combining design elements of.a common set limited to
twelve. Under these circumstances it was obviously impossible to main-
tain the individual design elements semantically constant and a drastic
compromise had to be made. By choosing nine graphic elements that could
be readily superimposed, one over the other, and three basic colours, a
little additional flexibility was gained (see Table 1). By &amp;quot;miAdng&amp;quot; the
16
three basic colours we could generate seven discriminable hues. Together
with black (absence of colour), this gave us eight background features,
and these could be used to colour-code at least some important conceptual
categories (see Table 2).
Interpretive versus Descriptive Grammar
The grammar of Yarkash is a direct derivative of the &amp;quot;correlational&amp;quot;
grammar that was implemented some years ago in the Multistore parser for
English sentences (von Glasersfeld, 1964, 1965, 1970; von Glasersfeld
and Pisani, 1968, 1970). It is, therefore, strictly an interpretive
grammar and lays no claim to &amp;quot;generative&amp;quot; properties, nor is it &amp;quot;trans-
formational&amp;quot; in the Chomskyan sense of that term.
In the hope that it might dispel some misunderstandings that have
haunted the development of correlational grammar since its initial
conception by&apos;Silvio Ceccato (Ceccatio et al., 1960, 1963), I should like
to dwell for a moment on a purely theoretical point. while the term
&amp;quot;grammar&amp;quot; is predominantly used to indicate the formalized description
of a language (e.g. Chomsky, 1965; 9 and 140), &amp;quot;correlational grammar&amp;quot;
is, instead, the description of an interpretive system. The main difference
between the two, though basically simple, has perhaps not been made
sufficiently explicit. An ordinary grammar is expected to account for
all grammatical sentences of the language in a more or less axiomatic
way, i.e. by demonstrating that every possible grammatical sentence is
a case under a formally stated rule or set of rules. An interpretive
grammar, on the other hand, is not concerned with demonstrating the
grammaticality of any sentence, but with transforming the content of a
given piece of language into a canonical fOrM composed of pre-established
17
semantic elements or modules. It is a &amp;quot;grammar&amp;quot; in the sense that it
consists of rules that govern this transformation, but these rules describe
the language only indirectly, since what they actually describe is a model
of the language user in the receiving role. (Note that by &amp;quot;model&amp;quot;, in
this context, we intend a processor which, given the same input, will
yield the same output as the processor to be modelled, regardless of the
means it employs to do so.) An interpretive system of this kind, thus,
presupposes the grammaticality of its input. But since it is designed to
interpret all grammatical pieces of language, it can be used to define
operationally as &amp;quot;grammatical&amp;quot; any input that it can interpret, while
input that it cannot interpret can be considered &amp;quot;ungrammatical&amp;quot;.
When designing a correlational grammar for a natural language, it
it a truly enormous problem to bring the grammar&apos;s interpretive capability
anywnere near the interpretive capability of the native user of the
language. In the case of an artificial language, however, this problem
is altogether eliminated, because the lexicon, the rules of concatenation,
and the interpretive grammar can be designed all at the same time.
Since there is no native user, who has a universe of experiential content
and well-established semantic connections (by means of which this
content is linked to linguistic expressions), the designer is free to
tailor the lexicon, as well as the syntax of his language, to the
universe of discourse he envisages.
That is, to a large extent, how Yerkish was designed, expecially
with regard to the rules of grammar. The result of it is that the user
of Yerkish can communicate in grammatically correct_lexigram strings no
more than the correlational grammar of Yerkish can interpret.
18
A Restricted Universe of Discourse
Yerkish, as it operates at present, is in fact a compromise in
more than one respect. An effort was made to create a potential universe
of discourse that would allow a non-human primate to formulate as many
communications as possible which, given the particular environment,
could be used instrumentally for the attainment of goals (von Glasers-
feld, 1974a). Such an attempt is necessarily based on more or less
anthropocentric conjecture. There is, however, a certain amount of
evidence that non-human primates organize their perceptual world in
a way that does not seem incompatible with ours. In actual fact,
Lana has already demonstrated that all the items which we assumed
would take on the function of goals for her and would, therefore, act
as incentive to communicatory activity, were indeed appropriate. Where
food and drink were concerned, this could almost be taken for granted.
With visual displays such as a movie and slides, with the sounds of music
and voices, and with the view through an open window, our anthropocentric
hope of analogy was well rewarded. Above all it is gratifying to note
that there was never a need to resort to any form of negative reinforce-
ment or punishment. Though there were, especially at the beginning, not
very many things that Lana could say&amp;quot; in Yerkish, she has never tired
of saying them.
On the practical side, since the interpretive grammar was to be
implemented in a functioning parser, the universe of discourse was
strictly limited by the size of the computer that could be obtained
within the budget of the project. Because the prolect is wholly
experimental and explorative, it was and is an absolute requirerent to
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.442799">
19
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997185">
leave within the computerized system a certain amount of room for
ad hoc modifications and additions that might suddenly prove necessary
in view of OUT subject&apos;s actual performance. Thus it was essential
that the implemented grammar should never occupy all of the available
space within the computer. This is still the case and we hope to be
able to maintain this flexibility for some time to come.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.872258">
Technical Constraints
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.987639722222222">
There are four ways in which the Yerkish universe of discourse
is restricted. First, there is the number of lexical items the system
can handle. The present version of the Multistore parser can deal
with a maximum of 250 lexigrams. The interface that links the computer
to the keyboard in the experimental chamber is designed for half that
number, i.e. for 125. The-keyboard, however, is divided into five panels
of 25 keys each and these panels are readily exchangeable. This means
that the subject&apos;s vocabulary can, in fact, be extended to 250 items,
but only a Subset of these, namely 125, will be operative during any
one session. (Since Lana at present uses a total of 100 lexigrams, there
is still much room for vocabulary expansion.),
The second restriction also concerns the vocabulary of lexigrams,
but it springs from the grammar of Yerkish and does not limit the number
of individual lexigrams but rather the number of conceptual classes to
which lexigrams have to be assigned. Because of its interpretive
function, correlational grammar requires a classification of lexical
items that differs considerably from the word-classification used by
traditional descriptive grammars. Lexigrams, in fact, are classified
according to certain functional characteristics of the concepts they
20
designate, i.e., according to cognitive characteristics.
The lexicon with which a correlational grammar operates, therefore,
Is divided, not into a few generic and largely morphologically defined
classes such as nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc., but into a much larger
number of classes defined in terms of what the designated items can do,
i.e., by the role or roles they play in the cognitive representation of
experiential situations. In the case of &amp;quot;things&amp;quot;- this is, for instance,
the kinds of activity which they can perform as actors and the kinds of
activity in which they can play the part of patient; and in the case
of &amp;quot;activities&amp;quot; it is, for instance, the kinds of change they &apos;bring
about.
In the implementation of the interpretive system, i.e. the parser,
it i6 the characterization of the lexical classes that occupies considerable
space, not the individual lexical items. The total number of classes,
therefore, has to be decided a priori. In the present Yerkish parser,
the maximum number of lexigram classes is 46. At the time oi writing,
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.686037">
35 of these classes have been filled (see Table 3). The remaining 11
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.940049193548387">
are still empty, but they can be made operative at any moment by the
simple insertion of new lexigrams and the definition of the funclional
properties uf the items they designate.
The third restriction concerns the number of lexigrams that can be
strung together to form one message. The amount of data the parser has
to take into account during the processing of a given message, obviously,
depends to some extent on the number of lexical items of which the
message is composed. This dimension corresponds to sentence length in
natural languages. As it was impossible to foresee with any precision
21
just how much work space the parser might require for the analysis of
all types of grammatical input strings, we preferred to be on the safe
side and limited sentence length to seven lexigrams. On the basis of
the experience gathered since then, we can &apos;low say that the computer
system could, in fact, handle input strings of up to ten lexigrams and,
hence, we plan to extend the capacity of the interface hardware in the
near future from seven to ten lexigrams.
The fourth restriction involves the number of connectives (see
Table 4) by means of which phrases and sentences can be put together.
These connectives or correlators are far more numerous in a correlational
grammar than afe the traditional syntactic functions. This proliferation
is again the result of the interpretive purpose of the systeri. A parser
that is intended to extract the conceptual content from pieces of
language must be able to identify not only the conceptual items involved,
but also the relational concepts by means of which they are connected
with one another. Hence, the traditional distinction between syntax
and semantics is no longer operative it a correlational grammar, and
the few &amp;quot;basic grammatical relations&amp;quot; (e.g. subject-verb, verb-object, etc.)
which connect grammatically characterized items, are replaced by a great
many &amp;quot;correlators&amp;quot; which are considered the linguistic expression of the
relational concepts that link items on the conceptual level.

The Grammar of Yerkisb
The interpretive purpose of correlational grammars leads to a
shifting of focus from Characteristics of words and sentences, qua
linguistic items, to the characteristics of concepts and conceptual
structures, qua cOgnitive items. Ideally, a correlational grammar should
be a complete mapping of the semantic connections between the elements
and structures of a given language, on the one hand, and the elements
and structures of conceptual representation, on the other. The bulk of
work required to produce such a mapping for a given natural language
is so vast as to be almost forbidding. Nevertheless, work in that
direction continues under various headings and significant advances
have been made (e.g. Schank, 1972, 1973). It will take a good deal
more time to map the semantics of an average language user&apos;s universe of
dfscourse, but that is hardly a reason for not going on with it,
expeciaily since much of what has been done encourages the hope that the
task can, indeed, be completed.
In designing an artificial language with a drastically curtailed
universe of discourse, the problem is far more manageable. The semantic
connections can be made as univocal as desired and, consequently, the
process of interpretation can be thoroughly systematic. In the case of
Yerkisn, univocality was desirable not only with a view to the sizeof
the automatic parser but also from the point of view of the teaching
strategies to be employed with a non-human subject. Hence, Yerkish was

23
made as univocal as possible.
Since both on the linguistic and on the conceptual level we are
dealing with eiementg and their concaternation in structures, the
interpretive grammar has to specify the connections (a) between linguistic
and conceptual elements and (b) between linguistic and conceptual struc-
tures. With regard to tike elements that are concatenated on the linguistic
level, their semantic specification can be given in the lexicon because,
here, we are dealing with a fixed set of items, i.e. precisely, lexical
items. With regard to structures - phrases and sentences on the
linguistic levels and situational representations on the conceptual level -
they have to be specified by rules of composition on concatenation, i.e.
by a grammar, because language is &amp;quot;open&amp;quot; in that direction and allows of
a practically infinite number of individually different word concatena-
tions.
Because Yerkish is based on English and the output of subjects in
the experimental environment will be evaluated by English speakers,
the lexical semantics of Yerkish lexigrams could be left implicit to a
certain extent. Thus, for instance, the Yerkish parser does not have to
contain an exhaustive semantic analysis of lexigrams such as BALL or
RAISIN, because it can be taken for granted that the reader of the
parser&apos;s output will be quite familiar with the concepts designated by
&amp;quot;ball&amp;quot; or by &amp;quot;raisin&amp;quot; qua experiential items. What the parser must
contain, however, is a mapping of thoSe specific characteristics of the
concepts which determine these items&apos; potential for entering into
structural relations with other items.
In Yerkish, then, the relational characteristics of conceptual items
24
determine the classification of lexigrams. Thus, having decided, for
instance, that there should be items that can be eaten and items that
can be drunk, the lexigrams designating these items will be divided, into
edibles (i.e suitable patient/objects for the activity designated by
EAT) and drinkables (i.e. suitable patient/objects for the activity
designated by DRINK). Together they constitutethe class of ingestibles
which, as it happens, is marked by the red hue of the corresponding
lexigrams (see Tables 2 and 3).
In short, Yerkish grammar does not require, nor lead to, a complete
semantic analysis of lexical items. What it does require is a lexicon
in which classes of lexical items are exhaustively characterized as to
the specific relations into which their members can enter with members
of other classes. This exhaustive characterization is supplied, not
by listing all the other classes with whose members connections can be
potentially formed, but by a string of indices, each of which specifies
a connective relation and the place in it (c.f. below) a member of the
class thus characterized can occupy.
Finally, we come to the relational concepts or correlators which
are instrumental in the building up of complex structures, both on the
conceptual and on the linguistic level. Strictly speaking, a correlator
is a connective function that links conceptual items on the cognitive-
representational level. Languages indicate these connective functions
by a variety of means: prepositions; verbs, nouns, and other types of
words that incorporate a preposition; conjunctions and other particles;
syntactic &amp;quot;markers&amp;quot; and, very frequently, merely word-order. Since
these linguistic elements indicate correlators, we should call them
25
&amp;quot;correlator expressions&amp;quot;. However, once it has been made clear that
correlators function on the conceptual level and connect concepts with
other concepts or combinations thereof, we can in most cases use the
term &amp;quot;correlator&amp;quot; for both the relational concepts and the linguistic
devices that express them.(3)
In designing an artificial language, the classification-of lexical
items and the definition or explication of relational concepts must go
hand in hand since the first is done in terms of the second. The rela-
tional conctpts have to be explicitly listed and explicated by some
form of paraphrase. In principle, that is what a &amp;quot;case grammar&amp;quot;
does. Its cases, basically, are relational concepts (e.g. Fillmore,
1968). However, because correlational grammar attempts to cover as
much relational semantics as possible, its list of correlators will be
both much longer and Tore specific than the lists of &amp;quot;cases&amp;quot; yhich,
to my knowledge, have been suggested.
Yerkishi in its present form operates with some thirty correlators
and the Yerkish lexicon is clasdified with reference to these (see Tables
3 and 5).
Given a basic list of correlators and their linguistic expression,
the classification of lexical items can be carried out by listing
for each item the correlators by means of which it can be potentially
(3) One area where the distinction has to be maintained is the,semantic
analysis of natural languages, because correlator expressions such as
prepositions rarely have a one-to-one correspondence to relational
concepts; instead, they merely mark the precence of one of a set of
relational concepts.
26
linked to other items. To give an example, there is a relational
concept (No. 11 ) paraphrased as active ingestion of solids involving
solid food stuff&apos;; on the linguistic level, this correlator is expressed
by the juxtaposition of two lexical items in a certain order. If we
now have a lexigram EAT, that designates active ingestion of solids&apos;
and another lexigram RAISIN, that designates a subcategory of &apos;solid food
stuff&apos;, we can form a compound or correlation with the two lexigrams
which can be represented as the structure:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.875313">
(a) EAT RAISIN
L. 11-
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.974732717948718">
Because the order of succession of the two items in the linear
linguistic expression is obligatory and cannot be reversed, it is not
enough for the grammar merely to supply the information that the lexigrams
EAT and RAISIN can be linked by correlator No. 11, but the grammar must
also specify that, in this correlation, EAT has to be the left-hand
piece (LH) and RAISIN the right-hand piece (RH).
This information is part of the permanent lexicon of the system.
It is recorded there by means of &amp;quot;correlation indices&amp;quot; (Ic&apos;s), which
consist of the number of the potential correlator plus the indication
whether the items to which this Ic is assigned can function as LH-piece
or as RH-piece. In many cases there are, of course, several lexical
items that can function in the same place (e.g. NUT, MEM candy, RAISIN,
etc., as RH-piece of correlator No. 11). Therefore Ic&apos;s are assigned
to lexigram classes, not to single lexical items. Thus, while the
lexigram EAT, in the present Yerkish lexicon, Is the only member of the
class VE (&apos;active ingestion of solids&apos;), the lexigrar RAISIN is one of
27
several in the class EU (&amp;quot;solid food stuff&apos;). On the one hand, this
indexing of classes, rather than individuals, is obviously more economical
with regard to storage space, on the other, it makes it possible to
add new lexigrams to the existing classes without in any way disturbing
the operative part of the lexicon or the parsing algorithms.
To expand the above example, let us add another correlation. The
relational concept that can be paraphrased as &apos;autonomous animate actor&apos;
performing &apos;stationary activity&apos; is correlator No. 01. The paraphrase
autonomous animate actor&apos; comprises three lexigram classes in the
present lexicon, nAmely AP (&apos;familiar primates&apos;, i.e., the regular tech-
nicians TIM, SHELLEY, BEVERLY, and the experimental animal LANA); AV
(&apos;visiting primates&apos;, i.e., unnamed human or non-human visitors); and
AO (&apos;non-primates&apos;, i.e., at present ROACH only). The paraphrase
&apos;stationary activity&apos;, i.e. acttvities that do not involve a change of
place on the part of the actor, nor a change of hands on the part of a
patient, comprises three lexigram classes, namely VE (with the single
member EAT), VD (with ehe single member DRINK), and VA (with several
members such as GROOM, TICKLE, HOLD, etc.).
Given the lexigram sequence LANA EAT, the interpretive grammar finds
that LANA, belonging to class AF, bears the lc: 01, LH, while EAT,
belonging to class VE, bears the Ic: 01, RH; and on the strength of this
the grammar will allow the correlation:

<bodyText confidence="0.900343666666667">
For the parser, &amp;quot;allowing a correlation&amp;quot; means to record it as a
possible part-interpretation of the input 8tritig.. As such it is recorded
28
as a &amp;quot;product&amp;quot; in order to be tested for its potential correlability with
other parts of the input.
The information, on the basis of which such first-level correlations
(connecting single lexigrams as in a and b) are formed, is contained in
the permanent lexicon and the form in which it is stored can be
visualised as a kind of matrix (see Fig. 2 and Table 5).

The correlational data required to form examples (a) and (b) is
represented by markers (x) indicating the l&apos;s (at head of column)
assigned to the lexigxam classes (at beginning of row). In the present
implementation of the Yerkish grammar h 34, in = 35.
Though this information contained in the lexicon covers all
correlations involving two single lexiglams, it does not provide or
correlations linking phrases or phrases and lexigrams. The system a
correlational grammar uses to discover higher-level structures in a given
input string is again rather different from that of traditional gtammar.
29
It order to be able to handle phrases, i.e., already correlated lexigrams,
or &amp;quot;products&amp;quot;, in exactly the same way as single lexical items, each
product must be assigned a string of Ic&apos;s that represents its particular
potential for functioning as component (LH-piece or P11-piece) of a new
and larger correlation that links it with other lexical items or phrases.
The procedure that assigns these Ic&apos;s to a given product is what
might be called the dynamic part of the grammar, because it is governed
by ,a set of operational rules that cannot he stated in- a simple formalized
way. (4) The reason for this is that the correlability of a given phrase
often depends on more than one constituent of the phrase.
An example may help to make this clear. With regard to zorrelator
ro. 30 that links the two single lexigrams involved, the phrases
THIS RAISIN and THIS BALL
L. - 30 L. 30
are identical. Ps potential PE-pieces of a correlation formed by
correlator No. 11, however, they are not equivalent.

would not be acceptable because BALL does not belong to the lexigram iass
EU defined as !solid food stuff! and, therefore. is not a potential RH-piec(
(4) The operational rules are, of course, always combinations of indiv-
dually simple rules taken from a relatively small set. This is, indeed
the way in which the parsing program compiles them; although this can
be called &apos;f,ormalisation! Lt certainly is not a simple one.

of correlation Na. 11. In fact, if the string FAT THIS BALL occurs as
input to the interpretive grammar, it must he reiected as incorrect.
To implement this discrimination, the phrabe THIS RAISIN must be
assigned the I: Li, PH, while the phrase THIS BALL must not. And in
order to do this, the assignation must be based not only on the
particular correlator that links THIS with another item, hut also on the
condition that this other item is one that belongs to the lexigram class
solid food stuff&apos;. In other words, there has to be an operational
assignation rule that makes sure that a first-level correlation produced
by correlator No. 30 is assigned the Ic:11, PP, so that it can Fe linked
in a second-level correlation with the preceding lexigram FLAT, which
bears the Ill, IT; but this assignation must, he made contingent upon the
condition that the product 30 (P:30) does, in fact, contain a lexical item
of class EU as RP-piece, because only if P:30 contains a member of the
class &apos;solid food stuff&apos; can it function as patient of the activity
designated by the LP lexigram FAT.
The operational assignation rules, therefore, are of diverse types,
some assigning Ic&apos;s unconditionally, others assigning Ic&apos;s only on condi-
tion that the same Ic is present, as the case may be, among those charac-
terising the LE or the RE of the produt that is being classified. (See
Table 6).
In the implementation of the parser., the assignation of I&apos;s to
products is primarily determi.ned by the particular correlator that is
involved in the product to be classified. The assignation rules a particu-
lar correlator calls into action, though functionally of three types
31
only, are specific to that correlator and cannot be written in a generalised
form; This indeed, is the fundamental reason why a correlational grammar
cannot be represented by means of a small number of relatively &amp;quot;powerful&amp;quot;
rules. In a correlational grammar there must be as many sets of specific
assignation rules as there are correlators; and since the. number of
correlators in such an interpretive grammar is very much larger than the
number of &amp;quot;syntactic functions&amp;quot; in conventional descriptive grammars,
correlational grammars connot be written in concise and powerful formulas.
As a justification for this lack of fOrmal elegance, however, it can be
said that correlational grammar has no need of the otherwise indispensable
and somewhat unwieldy adjunct of &amp;quot;selection rules&amp;quot;, because it incorporates
that very information in its one basic interpretive algorithm.
Peculiarilies of the Yerkish, Grammar
The grammar of Yerkish had to be kept as simple as possible for the
reasons mentioned above. First, given the small size of the computer,
it waE mandatory to avoid complex constructions and rules of grammar that
might require special space- and time-consuming subroutines in the
parsing procedure. Second, the rules of the language to which the lingui-
stic behavior of our subject would have to conform, were to be few and
consistent from the learner&apos;s point of view; nevertheless they were to be
such thst Yerkish structures could be translated easily and without major
structural transformations into comprehensible English. As a result of
these objectives, Yerkish grammar may seem somewhat unusual. In the fol-
lowing paragraphs several deviations from English grammar will be dis-
cussed.
Yerkish, at present, has only one voices the active, and three moods,
32
i.e. indicative, interrogative, and imperative. Both he interrogative
and the imperative are formed( not by specific verb-forms or word-order
(as in wdny natural languages), but by sentential prefixes or markers, i.e.
specific lexigrams that are placed at the beginning of the tessage. The
prefix of the interrogative is the conventional question mark &amp;quot;?&amp;quot;, that
for imperatives (in Yerkish &amp;quot;requests&amp;quot;) is an arrow, translated into
English as PLEASE. The keys representing these two lexigrams must be
pressed at the beginning of a string and they can appear only in the first
feedback projector on the left. The lexigram string following them has
the same form as an indicative statement. In fact, if the string is to be
interpreted as an indicative.statement, i.e.. if it is not preceded by
either &amp;quot;?&amp;quot; or PLEASE, the first feedbaaprojector on the left remains
blank. Thus:
TIM MOVE INTO ROOM = indicative statement;
? TIME MOVE INTO ROOM interrogative;
PLEASE TIM MOVE INTO ROOM = request.
A third lexigram that functions as a sentential marker is NO, which
corresponds to an over-all negation of the statement. NO TIM MOVE INTO
ROOM, therefore, corresponds o the English &amp;quot;it is not the case that
Tim moves into the room&amp;quot;. However, since Lana has quite spontaneously
come to use the lexigram NO to designate what, given the situational
context, could be interpreted only as &amp;quot;don&apos;t&amp;quot;, we may adapt the grammar
to her usage and turn this NO into a marker for negative imperatives (see
Appendix).
Yerkish, as yet, has no tenses but the present. A simple past and
future, however, are foreseen, and they will be designated by particles
33
preceding the activity lexigram.
There are no auxiliaries in Yerkish and the function of the English
copula &amp;quot;to be&amp;quot; is taken over by cortelator No. 10, which is expressed by
juxtaposition of a lexigram belonging to one of the classes of items that
are &amp;quot;modifiable&amp;quot; and a lexigram designating a specific state.
e.g. BALL RED. = &amp;quot;the ball is red&amp;quot;;
TIM AWAY. = &amp;quot;Tim is away&amp;quot;;
The absence of an explicit copula is noticeable also in conjunction
with the &amp;quot;naming function&amp;quot;, an important instrument in Lana&apos;s acquisition
of new lexical items. It is used for the ostensive definition of new
lexigrams which are placed at the beginning of a string of the form:
XX NAME-OF THIS &amp;quot;XX is the name of this&amp;quot;.
(where XX is the new lc:xigram)
Two English constructions that have a specificatory restrictive
function., i.e. for instance; &amp;quot;the red ball&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;the ball which is red&amp;quot;
are one and the same in Yerkish, and the specificatpry relation is
designated by a lexigram which can be translated into English as the
compound WHICH-IS (correlator No. 31).
e.g. BALL WHICH-IS RED. &amp;quot;the red ball&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;the hal
which-is red&amp;quot;.
For the sake of greater univocality, Yetkish spatial prepositions
were strictly divided into locatidnal and directional ones. The first --
e.g. IN, ON,OUTSIDE, etc. -- could designate clnly the location of items or
activities, the second -- e.g. INTO, OUT-OF, FROM, etc. -- could designate
only the direction of activities involving a change of place. tiowever,
since Lana has spontaneously used a locational preposition to indicate
34
the target ot a directional activity, and since this is allowable in
many if not all natural languages, we are considering the removal of this
restriction with regard to spatial prepositions.
So far, there are no conjunctions in Yerkish, but a somewhat restric-
ted form of &amp;quot;and&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;or&amp;quot; has been worked out and will shortly be intro-
duced into the system.
There are also some minor pecularities that an English-speaker must
keep in mind, A Yerkish structure involving correlator No. 17, for
instance, implies that the speaker is the receiver of the item that
changes hands, unless another receiver is explicitly indicated by a pre-
positional complement. Thus, if Lana sends the message:
PLEASE TIME GIVE MILK.
40
it must be understood that the milk is to be given to Lana. The receiver,
however, can be made explicit by adding a prepositional phrase, whith
yields the correlational structure:
</bodyText>
<note confidence="0.516419">
PLEASE TIM GIVE MILK TO LANA..
</note>
<footnote confidence="0.674963833333333">
1-17-1 1-22—k
English resultative verbs, e.g. &amp;quot;to open&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;to clean&amp;quot;, etc., are.
broken up in Yerkish. The causative element is rendered by MAKE, the
effect by a lexigram designating the resulting state. Also, in Yerkish
the agent must be specified. Thus, &amp;quot;Please (Tim) open the window&amp;quot;
becomes:
</footnote>
<figure confidence="0.8951472">
PLEASE TIM MAKE WINDOW OPEN.
35
L 06
10
18 ---I
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.993043">
Translated literally into English, this should be &amp;quot;Please,. Tim, make
window be open&amp;quot;, since the correlator that links WINDOW and OPEN is No. 10,
i.e. the predicative copula equivalent to &amp;quot;to be&amp;quot;. But in this case, as•
indeed in most occurrences of correlator No. 10, the Yerkish string is
easily understood without the explicit copula.
The Yerkish MAKE is not limited to causation of a change of state of
specific items, but can be used also to indicate a number of perceptual
conditions or events in the environment. Specific sensory events or
changes, such a MOVIE, MUSIC, SLIDE, HEAT, COLD, LIGHT, and DARKNESS, are
considered the result. of activities subsumed by.MAKE. In Lana&apos;s wholly
technological environment, this is not at 211 unreasonable. It obviously
makes sense for her to request:

<equation confidence="0.684601625">

It is, indeed, the machine that causes the projector to start running.
Similarly, however, in Yerkish one could correctly say:

L 06

<page confidence="0.974395">

<bodyText confidence="0.897861333333333">
Though in Lana&apos;s experience Tim can indeed &amp;quot;cause less heat&amp;quot; by turning
down the thermostat, this would hardly be a reasonable request in the
real&amp;quot; world outside the Yerkes Lab.
MAKE also opens the way to embedded constructions, since it can
govern a clause. Though Lana has not yet come to this, the grammar foresees
strings such as :

and similar structures are, of course, possible with WANT.
Lest these correlational diagrams create the impression that Yerkish
structures are invariably right-branching, here are two examples that
contain left-branchings:

which in English, would be: &amp;quot;The stick which is blue is dirty&amp;quot;, and, as
such, roughly equivalent to &amp;quot;The blue stick is dirty.&amp;quot;
In one particular the grammar of Yerkish deviates from correlational

practice. Prepositions and conjunctions being &amp;quot;explicit&amp;quot;&apos;correlator
expressions in that they designate relational c.oncepts only, are (in the
correlational approach) not items-to be linked, but items that do the
linking. Thus, in the original Iklultistore parser they functioned as
cortelators and not as ordinary lexical items. In the structure diagrams,
therefore, they appeared in a node, not at a terminal. Given the very
smEL1 computer used for the Yerkish parser, as well as the fact that the
lexicon was to remain extremely limited (in comparison to English),it was
more economical to correlate prepositional phrases in two steps rather than
introduce the special routine that had been developed for prepositions and
other &amp;quot;explicit&amp;quot; correlator expressions in the English parser. Thus a
string such as &amp;quot;move into room&amp;quot; is not constructed as it would be in a
proper correlational system, i.e.:
MOVE ROOM.

where P:21 containing P:22 expresses the conceptual relation designated by
INTO.
In all other respects the Yerkish system is similar to the Multistote
parser whose characteristic data-compression was, in fact, the feature
that made it possible to contain the entire system - lexicon, operational
interpretive grammar, and automatic response programs - in less than 5000
machine words of central core.

Conclusion
Though Yerkish is, indeed, an extremely limited linguistic system,
the examples of sentence structure I have used above should &apos;be sufficient
to show that it has a considerable range and flexibility with regard to
what can be formUlated in it. The reports on Lana&apos;s progress that we
have published so far (Rumbaugh et al., 1973b, 1974; von Glasersfeld,
1974b; see also Appendix to this paper) leave little doubt that Lana has
already acquired a number of skills that certainly belong to what is
usually called linguistic competence. The grammar of Yerkish as it is
at present allows many structures which are still far out of Lana&apos;s
reach. She has a long way to go before one might venture to say that
she fully exploits the expressive possibilities of Yerkish. That is
precisely how it was intended at the outset of the project.
In any case, the range of expression could easily be extended at
short notice and without interfering with the existing operational system.
Nor would such additions require an inordinate expansion of the
lexicon. The introduction of the one lexigram WANT, for instance, has
opened the way to a completely new level of expression that may even-
tually lead to a demonstration of the chimpanzee&apos;s capability for concep-
tual representation. The addition of a Yerkish &amp;quot;if. . . then&amp;quot; would be
no more difficult and could perhaps further clarify the cognitive poten-
tial of non-human primates.() Such additions could also make Yerkish a
(5) Premack (1971) reported that his chimpanzee Sara could correctly
interpret an &amp;quot;if. . . then&amp;quot; connection between actual activities
or states; the greater range and flexibility of Yerkish would make
possible the introduction of much more sophisticated hypothetical
statements.

that we are now exploring the possibility of adapting the Yerkish system,
its grammar, and the parser, to a form of simple English.

Subsequent work (Gardner &amp; Gardner, 1971; Premack, 1971) demonstrated that communication could be achieved by means visualsigns or symbols. is a visual language with a lexicon of Symbols (lexigrams), each of which is a combination of discree recursive&apos;design elements. Each lexigram is represented on one of 125 keys of a keyboard. Sentences are formed by pressing keys in successive order. Sentence length, at present, is limited to seven lexigrams. Input from the keyboard is monitored and recorded by a computer that, contains in its the lexicon, a parser, and certain response The grammar is strictly interpretive and was derived from the &apos;correlational&apos; system implemented in the lAiltistore parser for English sentences (von Glasersfeld.&amp; Pisani, 1970). The parser works on the basis of essentially non-linguistic classifications of items and relational concepts (tables of the operational classes are provided in this paper). It produces a structural analysis in terms of immediate constituents. If an input string yields one comprehensive structure, the string is deemed grammatical. The first lexigram functions as a sentence marker indicating the mood of the utterance: affirmative, negative, interrogative, and imperative, in the case of certain 2 3 requests (imperatives), the computer activates methanical devices that fulfil the request (dispensing food, drink, toys, playing music or a movie, etc.) Given this response capability, a 24-hour learning situation is created in which there is always some potential incentive for the animal to use linguistic communication. Yerkish lexigrams and sentences are easily translated into English, but setantics and sentence structure are somewhat restricted. Lexigrams always have only one meaning of the corresponding English word, and the rules for their concatenation were designee to reduce ambiguities to a minimum. The paper explains deviations from English grammar by means of structural diagrams and demonstrates that, in spite of the many simpli fications, Yerkish allows for embedded clauses and is, indeed, capable of expansion in many directions. Three examples of &apos;conversations&apos; with the young female chimpanzee that is being taught the use of Yerkish are added as an appendix to the paper.</abstract>

It is, therefore, strictly an interpretive grammar and lays no claim to &amp;quot;generative&amp;quot; properties, nor is it &amp;quot;transformational&amp;quot; in the Chomskyan sense of that term. In the hope that it might dispel some misunderstandings that have haunted the development of correlational grammar since its initial conception by&apos;Silvio Ceccato (Ceccatio et al., 1960, 1963), I should like to dwell for a moment on a purely theoretical point. while the term &amp;quot;grammar&amp;quot; is predominantly used to indicate the formalized description of a language (e.g. Chomsky, 1965; 9 and 140), &amp;quot;correlational grammar&amp;quot; is, instead, the description of an interpretive system. The main difference between the two, though basically simple, has perhaps not been made sufficiently explicit. An ordinary grammar is expected to account for all grammatical sentences of the language in a more or less axiomatic way, i.e. by demonstrating that every possible grammatical sentence is a case under a formally stated rule or set of rules. An interpretive grammar, on the other hand, is not concerned with demonstrating the grammaticality of any sentence, but with transforming the content of a</context>

The relational conctpts have to be explicitly listed and explicated by some form of paraphrase. In principle, that is what a &amp;quot;case grammar&amp;quot; does. Its cases, basically, are relational concepts (e.g. Fillmore, 1968). However, because correlational grammar attempts to cover as much relational semantics as possible, its list of correlators will be both much longer and Tore specific than the lists of &amp;quot;cases&amp;quot; yhich, to my knowledge, have been suggested. Yerkishi in its present form operates with some thirty correlators and the Yerkish lexicon is clasdified with reference to these (see Tables 3 and 5). Given a basic list of correlators and their linguistic expression, the classification of lexical items can be carried out by listing for each item the correlators by means of which it can be potentially (3) One</context>

The fact is that the behaviors an organism manifests in a given environment constitute under all circumstances only a subset of the behaviors which the organism could acquire in different environments (Lorenz, 1974). In the area of cognitive skills, for instance, Kohler&apos;s investigations (1925) already indicated that the great apes had been drastically underrated.

Thus, for instance, as the American Indian language Yuchi (Crawford, 1973) has a morpheme that recurs. in any word that designates a part of the human body, every Yerkish lexigram designating </context>

Among other things, this would mean that programming languages and other silent communication systems could never be called language, no matter how adequately they might be described in terms of lexicon, syntax, and semantics. Today, there seems to be a growing consensus that this restriction of &amp;quot;language&amp;quot; 9 to acoustic systems is not a scientifically necessary or useful one (Ploog and Melnechuck, 1971: 640; Lyons, 1972: 64). Interest, thus, has shifted from the question whether or not other organisms can learn to speak a language, to the question whether or not they can learn to handle a communication system that is linguistic in its structure. Given that there seems to be no compelling evidence that any nonhuman species on this earth has, in fact, developed a communication system that could legitimately be called &amp;quot;language&amp;quot;, one might be inclined to think that attemts to teach a language to a non-human organism are necessarilyooatetii tie- rail.fail.

Each lexigram is represented on one of 125 keys of a keyboard. Sentences are formed by pressing keys in successive order. Sentence length, at present, is limited to seven lexigrams. Input from the keyboard is monitored and recorded by a computer that, contains in its core the lexicon, a parser, and certain response capabilities. The grammar is strictly interpr</context>

Ideally, a correlational grammar should be a complete mapping of the semantic connections between the elements and structures of a given language, on the one hand, and the elements and structures of conceptual representation, on the other. The bulk of work required to produce such a mapping for a given natural language is so vast as to be almost forbidding. Nevertheless, work in that direction continues under various headings and significant advances have been made (e.g. Schank, 1972, 1973). It will take a good deal more time to map the semantics of an average language user&apos;s universe of dfscourse, but that is hardly a reason for not going on with it, expeciaily since much of what has been done encourages the hope that the task can, indeed, be completed. In designing an artificial language with a drastically curtailed universe of discourse, the problem is far more manageable. The semantic connections can be made as univocal as desired and, consequently, the process of interpretation can be thoroughly systematic.

Lieberman(1968), on the basis of anatomical investigations, -came to the conclusion that the vocal apparatus of the great apes precludes the production and modulation of many of the phonemes that make up the repertoire of human languages. Forty years earlier, Robert Yerkes (1925), the founder of the first primatological research institute, in whose honor we have named our language, had already observed this vocal handicap of the Tion-human primates. In the intervening years, the failure of several long-term efforts to teach a chimpanzee English, Japanese, or Russian, empirically confirmed his observation (for a review, cf. Floog and Melnechuk, 1971). The fact, however, that the great apeas are barred from speak„ing a language does not necessarily mean that they could not understand one, nor that they could not learn to use a lingUistic communication system that functi</context>
