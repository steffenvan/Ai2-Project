A work as big as this is sure to contain something to
offend everyone. Some of the articles, rather than being
well-fitting pieces in structure, are perhaps a little too
idiosyncratic; for example, Allen&apos;s lengthy complaints about
the paucity of computer-assisted stylistic studies of Spanish
text. And some authors are more adept than others at
making their topic comprehensible to the newcomer; the
same article by Allen is particularly reader-friendly. But
despite the handbook&apos;s size, what I noticed most were the
omissions. The short article on computer-assisted language
teaching does little justice to current research into the
application of sophisticated CL methods to the problem. I
could find nothing on dealing with ill-formed input (or did
the index let me down?). Transformational grammar is
mentioned a number of times, but government—binding
theory is not. Research in discourse structure is hardly
mentioned, except, unexpectedly, in the article on language
generation. No form of the term &amp;quot;anaphora&amp;quot; appears in the
index (though there is at least a passing mention of the
problem (p. 270) in Lenders&apos;s introduction to the sections
on processing). But such complaints should not be allowed
to obscure the wealth that can be found in this handbook. I
just wish that it were a little easier to find what one is
looking for.

An essential assumption of every syntactic theory is that the
sentences of natural language are internally structured. In the
early years of generative grammar it was generally believed that
the appropriate mechanism for generating syntactic structures
was a grammar of rewriting rules that operated free of context.
Recently, however, this belief and others concerning the nature of
phrase structure have increasingly come into question.
The twelve essays in this volume grew out of a conference
convened to discuss the challenge to the classical formulation of
phrase structure and the alternative conceptions proposed to
replace it. Each of the articles approaches this issue from the
perspective of a different linguistic framework, such as categorial
grammar, government-binding theory, head-driven phrase struc-
ture grammar, and tree-adjoining grammar. Evidence from a
number of languages and subdomains of grammar are brought to
bear on a variety of questions. What are the primitives out of
which structured representations are constructed?
What is the formal device that generates the infinite set of
representations for the infinite set of sentences of each natural
language? What is the relationship between lexical selection and
structure generation? The contributors also consider the possibil-
ity of reassigning the work done by rewriting rules to other formal
devices, the nature of selection, the character of unbounded
dependencies, and the treatment of word order variation in so-
called free word-order languages.—From the publisher&apos;s an-
nouncement

This book reviews natural language processing technology view-
points from both the academic and the business perspective. It is
not a highly technical or academic book per se, but rather, it
reviews the technology as a whole for the nonexpert in natural
language. The book presents the state of the art, forecasts of the
technology, and the outlook from a commercialization standpoint.
The reader who would benefit most is the technical manager or
professional contemplating the commercialization of an NLP
product. If the book is not mistaken as a &amp;quot;how to&amp;quot; textbook, it may
prove useful and satisfying; similar industry reports and forecasts
from private sources may cost hundreds of dollars.
A broad range of topics is covered. The book begins with an
overview of NLP approaches, formalisms, and methods. This is
followed by a detailed coverage of applications from natural
language interfaces and machine translation to text processing,
generation, writing aids, and speech. For each, the approaches,
state of the art, existing products, and prognosis for future
products are presented. The book ends with a section on current
issues, the business picture, and the &amp;quot;science&amp;quot; of NLP. A major
thesis of the book is that there is a marked difference between
business people and academics in the field; breakthroughs in the
science are needed and they should be driven by practical market
needs. For example, the metric of success in NLP should be
productivity improvement, not linguistic perfection.
The overall range of topics and information makes the book
useful from a practical standpoint. However, there are some
problems with the writing style and content in spots. The author
occasionally writes paragraphs that are incoherent—that is, they
wander into a number of different unrelated topics. Further, some
of the information was not carefully researched. Two examples:
On page 109, the author implies that the Unix Consultant is a
system that translates English commands to Unix, when it is
actually an advisory system about Unix. On page 119, a natural

language tool kit called Gopher is cited; yet the company that
announced Gopher ceased to exist before the product was ever
released.
Despite these problems, I found the book to be informative and
a useful adjunct to other NLP literature. As a practitioner, rather
than a theoretician, I found it to provide valuable market research
insight as well—Edwin R. Addison, Synchronetics Inc.

Frankly, this book disappointed me. I had been thinking that it
was about time that someone wrote or edited a book covering the
general topic of thematic relations, 0-roles, case relations, seman-
tic functions, or whatever they might be called, bringing together
the various approaches to the subject, going back to Fillmore and
Gruber, for a second look twenty years on, revisiting Jackendoff,
Chafe, Cook, Longacre, as well as more recent approaches as the
simila rly named, though different, Functional Grammars of Dik,
Halliday, and Kay, Starosta&apos;s Lexicase, Anderson&apos;s Localist Case
Grammar, Langacker&apos;s Cognitive Grammar, not to mention GB,
LFG, GPSG (and derivatives HPSG and JPSG), and Categorial
Grammar, inasmuch as these last three actually address these
issues. My own overview of Case Grammar (Somers 1987, but
essentially completed in 1984) predated and therefore missed
many of these developments. Dirven and Radden&apos;s (1987) collec-
tion is wide-ranging, but there is no comparison and contrast of
the approaches.
However, what the book reviewed here gives us is a volume
devoted entirely to only one of those approaches, namely Govern-
ment and Binding. That would not be such a bad thing if it
heralded a move by GB-practitioners toward a treatment of
thematic relations that acknowledged at least some of the advan-
tages of a representation in terms of (let&apos;s call them) semantic
functions, notably a &apos;deeper,&apos; less syntax-oriented, representation
that nevertheless permitted generalizations at the syntactic level
to be stated. This is what I take to be the underlying motivation
for all the above approaches. Regrettably, we hardly even get that
much. Rappaport and Levin&apos;s opening chapter (after Wilkins&apos;s
introduction) is promising: entitled &amp;quot;What to do with 0-roles,&amp;quot; it
at least addresses questions like &amp;quot;What is their nature?&amp;quot; and
&amp;quot;Where do they come from?&amp;quot; This broad-visioned approach was
not so surprising: Levin had earlier edited a much more catholic
collection of papers on a related topic (Levin 1985). Promising too
is CuLicover&apos;s discussion of the relationship between thematic
relations (&amp;quot;grounded in the elements that constitute our mental
representation of events&amp;quot; (p. 37)) and 0-roles, which are &amp;quot;the
corresponding representation of these components in syntax&amp;quot; (p.
38), a distinction that does not seem to be universal. But after that
we get only inward-looking discussions of issues that have already
been thoroughly aired beyond the confines of GB: 0-marking in
&amp;quot;complex predicates&amp;quot; like give . . . permission, make . . . offer
(Jayaseelan), multiple role assignment (Broadwell), 0-grids for
nominalizations (Randall, Rozwadowska). Even more inward-
looking and typical of the overly syntactic GB approach to 0-roles
and thematic relations are the articles on 0-roles and control verbs
(Ladusaw and Dowty, and Jones), links with surface case
(Schwartz), reflexives (Wilkins), and lexical entries in Warlpiri

I am not a devotee of GB. As an outsider, I can only say that its
practitioners would do well to look beyond the confines of their

This volume makes more widely available proceedings of the third
conference on Theoretical Issues in Natural Language Processing
(January 1987). This conference followed the unusual format of
consisting entirely of panels of invited speakers, each of whom
contributed a position paper written in advance. The volume of
position papers was distributed by the Association for Computa-
tional Linguistics.
The present volume contains a number of these position papers,
some of them revised by their authors, along with selected tran-
scripts of the discussion. Subject and name indexes have been
added.
The panels were the following:—Words and world representa-
tions (Walker, Boguraev, Amsler, Hobbs, Kegl); Unification and
the new grammatism (Gazdar, Pulman, Joshi); Connectionist and
other parallel approaches to natural language processing (Waltz,
Cottrell, Charniak, McClelland, Lehnert); Discourse theory, goals,
and speech acts (Perrault, Wilensky); Why has theoretical NLP
made so little progress? (Sondheimer, Birnbaum); Formal versus
commonsense semantics (Israel, Wilks, Sparck Jones); Reference:
The interaction of language and the world (Appelt, Dahl, Kron-
feld, Goodman); Metaphor (Gentner et al.. Ortony and Fainsil-
ber, Plantinga); Natural language generation (Joshi, McDonald,
Appelt).
