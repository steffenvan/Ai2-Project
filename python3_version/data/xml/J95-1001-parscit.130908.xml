Recent corpus-based work on word sense disambiguation explores the application of statistical
pattern recognition procedures to lexical co-occurrence data from very large text databases. In
this paper we argue for a linguistically principled approach to disambiguation, in which relevant
contextual clues are narrowly defined, in syntactic and semantic terms, and in which only highly
reliable clues are exploited. Statistical methods play a definite role in this work, helping to organize
and analyze data, but the disambiguation method itself does not employ statistical data or decision
criteria. This approach results in improved understanding of the disambiguation problem both
in general and on a word-specific basis and leads to broadly applicable and nearly errorless clues
to word sense. The approach is illustrated by an experiment discriminating among the senses of
adjectives, which have been relatively neglected in work on sense disambiguation. In particular,
the paper assesses the potential of nouns for discriminating among the senses of adjectives that
modify them. This assessment is based on an empirical study of five of the most frequent ambiguous
adjectives in English: hard, light, old, right, and short. About three-quarters of all instances
of these adjectives can be disambiguated almost errorlessly by the nouns they modify or by the
syntactic constructions in which they occur. Such disambiguation requires only simple rules,
which can be automated easily. Furthermore, a small number of semantic attributes supply a
compact means of representing the noun clues in a very few rules. Clues other than nouns are
required when modified nouns are not useable. The sense of an ambiguous modified noun may be
needed to determine the relevant semantic attribute for disambiguation of a target adjective; and
other adjectives, verbs, and grammatical constructions all show evidence of high reliability, and
sometimes of high applicability, when they stand in specific, well-defined syntactic relations to
the ambiguous adjective. Some of these clues, however, may be hard to automate.

This paper is an application of corpus analysis to an issue in word sense disambigua-
tion: to what extent adjectives&apos; senses can be separated by the nouns they modify,
or more generally, by the phrases they modify or take as complements. We are inter-
ested specifically in principled disambiguation—systematic interpretation using highly
reliable inferences based on linguistically motivated features. The work is empirical,
addressing five of the most common, broadly applicable adjectives in English: hard,
light, old, right, and short.
Nouns are intrinsically suited for principled disambiguation of adjectives. Most
adjectives normally designate an attribute of an entity designated by the noun or noun

phrase they modify. Often, one sense or group of senses designates an attribute that is
much more typically relevant to the noun&apos;s referent. For example, when the adjective
old characterizes a human being, as in old man or she is old, it usually means &apos;aged&apos;—not
&apos;used,&apos; of long standing,&apos; or &apos;former.&apos; In such cases, the mutual relevance of the adjec-
tive and noun senses is content specific (semantic) rather than word specific (lexical).
We presume that it is this semantic relation rather than a lexical association that is
normally involved in disambiguation.&apos; One of the issues to be addressed in disam-
biguation is the passage from word-specific evidence to conceptual representation, a
problem that we do not pretend to have solved in this paper.
In addition, we consider the syntactic constructions within which adjectives occur
and through which the phrases or clauses they modify are determined. For example,
some adjectives have senses that are not used predicatively; the use of such an adjective
as a predicate rules out such senses. The syntactic clues we recognize are as reliable
as the noun clues.
Noun-based disambiguation of adjectives is of special interest because a selection
among different attributes (adjective senses) is likely to be sensitive to the attribute
bundles (noun senses) they characterize. It does turn out that a small number of se-
mantic features of nouns do provide fairly high coverage and very high reliability
in adjective sense discrimination. Noun-based disambiguation is a structured form of
co-occurrence-based disambiguation, various forms of which are prominent in corpus-
based work. In co-occurrence-based approaches, it is usual to take into account the
entire set of words in the vicinity of a target (Maarek and Smadja 1989; Yarowsky
1992). Gale, Church, and Yarowsky (1992) demonstrate that high reliability and cov-
erage are simultaneously attainable with such an approach. The type of work we are
pursuing has the potential to be more readily interpretable, though it is more difficult
to automate. We suspect that the success of the comparison of contexts in bulk is due
in large part to the effect of a few highly structured types of clues, such as we examine,
and in part to more diffuse clues of other types.
We use statistical inference methods as tools for analyzing and attempting to un-
derstand the problem of disambiguation and the potential of resources such as modi-
fied nouns for solving this problem. Methodologically, our statistical analyses and our
extraction of disambiguating features from the corpus are straightforward, with one
exception: in order to be able to base inference on already disambiguated subcorpora,
we had to devise a way to adjust for the bias brought into the sample by the criteria
through which they had been disambiguated; the required formulas are presented and
illustrated in the Appendix.
The structure of the paper is as follows. In Section 2 we describe the notion of a
word sense indicator; this defines the types of features we consider as clues for disam-
biguation generally, and how specifically we use nouns as clues to the recognition of
adjective senses. In Section 3, we describe the type of data we use; by defining adjec-
tive senses in terms of the meanings of different antonyms, we can take advantage of a
large database of examples for analysis, examples that are ideally disambiguated by the
co-occurrence of adjectives and their antonyms in semantically concordant structures.
Section 4 provides a detailed report on the structure and results of the investigation
of noun-based disambiguation. Section 5 discusses more complex types of inference

1 Word-specific relations between adjectives and nouns are idiomatic, non-compositional pairs (so-called
&amp;quot;freezes&amp;quot;) in which the adjective itself has no independent sense, e.g., hard cash and short cut. In some
cases, such as hard fact, it is difficult to draw the line between a noun-specific sense (here,
&apos;incontrovertible&apos;) and a compositional sense (e.g., &apos;inflexible, unyielding&apos;); such indeterminacy is of
course one of the sources of a freeze.

2. Word Sense Indicators
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.990836222222223">
Our problem is a specific case of the more general problem of finding clues within
the context of a word that indicate its sense fairly reliably. Content words that have a
close syntactic relation to one another are useful candidates for examination and are
intuitively more likely to bear a close semantic relation than words that are near one
another but are not related syntactically. One much-studied example is the semantic
relation between a verb and its arguments (e.g., Boguraev et al. 1989; Church and
Hanks 1989; Braden-Harder 1991; Hindle and Rooth 1991).
Discrimination among senses of adjectives based on the nouns they modify or of
which they are predicated has been the subject of less intensive and systematic study.
Determining the potential of this line of evidence is the focus of this paper. We do this
by performing a noun-based disambiguation experiment. Certainly, some nouns are
strongly associated with particular senses of some of the adjectives that modify them.
This association can be illustrated for the ambiguous adjective old, which has senses
roughly synonymous with aged, long existing, former, used, and obsolete, using sentences
from our experimental corpus (see Section 4.1). Two of the nouns most frequently
modified by old in general texts are man and house. Overwhelmingly, old is used in the
sense &apos;aged (not young)&apos; when it modifies man, e.g., in
The man was very old and very frail, a widower.
He was a strong old man: he had lived through forty-five years of those wretched
casseroles, but she missed him already.
&amp;quot;Guilty!&amp;quot; came the hoarse croaking sounds of the old men.
In some sentences, in fact, this noun is the only real basis, within the sentence itself,
for inferring the sense of old:
The old man answered this time.
&amp;quot;Leave the other to the old man.&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;All except the old man.&amp;quot;
Man, therefore, can be taken as a fairly good indicator of the &apos;aged&apos; sense of old.
Similarly, when old modifies house, it almost always has one of its &apos;not new&apos; senses, as
in
In the fashionable suburb of Kingston, full of beautiful old houses. . .
. . . around the old Holton house he made many improvements. . .
He saw the tractors come and tear down the old houses and plow up the land. . .
When old modifies house, then, this is a good indication that old is being used in one
of these senses. So man and house are reliably associated with different senses of old.
We refer to man and house as indicators for the senses of old. More generally, a
feature F (such as the modified noun man) that is associated with a target word T

(such as the modifying adjective old) is an indicator for a sense S, (e.g., &apos;aged&apos;) of T if,
when the feature is present, that sense S, is more likely than the other senses Si, j i.
This statement is formalized in the Appendix.
This characterization of the indicators for word senses also provides flexibility
regarding sense definition. Not only does it not require a single assessment, once and
for all, concerning what the senses of a word may be, it requires no commitment to
the reality of word senses themselves, as classically construed (see Pustejovsky and
Boguraev 1993). Disambiguation may be pursued relative to many distinct issues, e.g.,
grammatical class, functional role, document topic, or lexical translation equivalent;
the entities to be discriminated are the effective &amp;quot;senses&amp;quot; being identified. In this
paper, we disambiguate relative to a pair of word sense groups, operationally by
disambiguating relative to sense-specific antonyms; an old man, for example, is a man
who is not young, and an old house is a house that is not new. Such sense distinctions
have some justification in terms of the semantic organization of adjectives (see Gross,
Fischer, and Miller 1989). However, our purpose in choosing them was purely for
convenience in designing an experiment useful for determining the potential of noun-
based disambiguation of adjectives.
The characterization of indicators is equally flexible with regard to the domain
of its own applicability. It need not be assumed that all instances of the target word
T are to be included in assessing the relative probabilities of different senses. In the
experiment described here, we are determining the extent to which those senses of an
adjective that are associated with one antonym can be distinguished from those associ-
ated with a different antonym according to the nouns that the target adjective modifies.
We therefore discriminate between just these two sets of senses, which constitute the
great majority of instances of the targets, and we exclude from both investigation and
evaluation all instances in which the sense of the target does not fall in one of these
two groups. We exclude all freezes from consideration as not being legitimate instances
in which the adjectives actually have a definable sense (see footnote 1). In addition,
we exclude the minority of instances that have definable senses that do not fall within
these two groups. For example, short has a sense &apos;inadequate&apos; that is related histori-
cally to its dimensional senses; however, this sense does not have a lexically specific
antonym, whereas the dimensional senses do (long and tall).

3. Disambiguated Subcorpora
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999907625">
To extract a reasonable number of nouns that are indicators for the senses of target
adjectives, one straightforward approach would be to extract a representative sample
of sentences for each target adjective, to disambiguate each target manually, and to
extract those nouns that are relatively frequent and that are modified by the target
in one sense but not in the other. We adopted a different strategy, one that provided
us with a large set of sentences in which target adjectives could be disambiguated
automatically and with complete reliability. This strategy involved disambiguation of
adjectives by their co-occurrence with sense-specific antonyms.
Antonym co-occurrence is a frequent and pervasive phenomenon, and it takes
place under highly restricted semantic and syntactic conditions (Charles and Miller
1989; Justeson and Katz 1991, 1992). An adjective and its antonym refer to opposed
values of the same attribute. When they modify the same noun in a sentence—this is
the usual case in sentences in which they both occur—this attribute is virtually ensured
of applying in a consistent way to both instances of the noun. When an adjective like old
has different senses that are associated with different antonyms (like new and young),
the adjective in these sentences is disambiguated by its antonym. Thus, in sentences

in which old and young modify the same noun, e.g., man, old is thereby interpretable
as &apos;not young&apos;; in those in which old and new both modify a noun, e.g., house, old is
thereby interpretable as &apos;not new.&apos;
The reason for this effect is easy to observe. Antonyms most often co-occur in
direct comparisons or in contrastive opposition, directly reflecting both the identity of
the attribute to which they pertain and the contrast in its value. As illustrated by the
following sentences from the Brown Corpus (Francis and Kucera 1982), they usually
occur in otherwise essentially identical phrases:

dark strand in position to be purled.

We often say of a person that he looks young for his age or old for his age.
We refer to this pattern as phrasal substitution. In these cases, the phrases involved
usually stand in direct semantic opposition (e.g., her right hand, . . . her left hand). Co-
occurring antonyms are also frequently joined by and or or, or appear in noun phrases
joined by prepositions and having the same head noun:
It was pitiful to see the thin ranks of warriors, old and young. . .
That was one more reason she didn&apos;t look forward to Cathy&apos;s visit, short or long;
As for this rider, I never saw him before or afterwards and never saw him dismounted,

from long and straight to short and tightly curled.
It was a winter world without details, a world of shapes in an expanse ranging in color
from light to dark gray.
But there is no sudden transition from hard rock to soft.
The chief function of these conjoined and prepositional co-occurrences is to cover the
range of possible values of an attribute.
Whether the antonym co-occurrences involve contrastive opposition or a range of
attribute values, they call forth the semantic dimension designated by the antonym
pairs and guarantee concordance in adjective sense of the co-occurring antonyms.
Thus, when an adjective has different sense-specific antonyms, their co-occurrences

as modifiers of different instances of the same noun reliably disambiguate that adjec-
tive. Five common English adjectives have such antonyms, yielding ten antonymous
adjective pairs: hard—easy, hard—soft; light—dark, light—heavy; old—new, old—young; right—
left, right—wrong; and short—long, short—tall. All the example sentences above involve
one of these ten pairs, and they exemplify the concordance of the antonyms&apos; senses.
Furthermore, certain departures from the perfect phrasal substitution patterns equally
constrain the senses of the antonyms to be concordant. These departures include in-
sertion of adverbial modifiers, substitution of other words besides the antonyms, or
use of the antonyms to modify noun phrases having the same head noun in phrases
that otherwise differ from one another. The subcorpora that were used in the work
reported here consist of those sentences in which a target adjective and its antonym
modify separate instances of the same noun or clause.

4. The Experiment
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999947411764706">
This section describes our investigation of noun-based disambiguation and its results.
Subcorpora were extracted for each of the five target adjectives, consisting of sen-
tences in which the target was disambiguated by its co-occurrence with an antonym
as modifiers of the same noun (Section 4.1). The tendency toward sense specificity
of nouns modified by target adjectives in these sentences is demonstrated by show-
ing that there is little overlap in the set of nouns modified by the target in the two
antonym co-occurrence subcorpora for that target (Section 4.2). Nouns indicating the
antonym-specific senses of these targets were then extracted by statistical analysis of
their sense preferences. It is shown that these indicator nouns are also specific to the
senses of the target adjectives in the corpus at large by using them successfully in a
disambiguation procedure applied to 500 randomly selected sentences (Section 4.3).
Simple, broadly applicable semantic features characterize most of the indicator
nouns, whereas broadly applicable syntactic features characterize many of their con-
texts. Together, these features discriminate the target senses, permitting a more com-
pact and conceptual rather than word-specific representation of the indicators (Sec-
tion 4.4): about three-quarters of the adjective instances are disambiguated by these
features, and virtually errorlessly.

<bodyText confidence="0.998997692307692">
Our original study of antonym co-occurrence (Justeson and Katz 1991) was based on a
version of the Brown Corpus, containing 54,717 sentences; it yields only 57 sentences
in which both adjectives from any of the ten antonym pairs analyzed in the present
study were modifying different instances of the same noun. To get enough sentences
containing antonym co-occurrences of antonyms to address disambiguation issues ad-
equately, we used the 1.5 million—sentence APHB Corpus. This corpus of 25,000,000
words was obtained from the American Printing House for the Blind and archived at
IBM&apos;s T.J. Watson Research Center. It consists of stories and articles from books and
general circulation magazines.
All sentences containing co-occurrences of the target adjective and each of its
antonyms were extracted from the APHB Corpus, yielding 4391 sentential co-occur-
rences. These sentences were manually postprocessed to eliminate all instances in
which either the target or its antonym was not being used adjectivally.&apos; From the

remaining sentences, we further extracted a subset of sentences in which both members
of the pair modify distinct instances of the same noun. This yielded 1487 sentences
in which at least one of the target adjectives co-occurs with one of its antonyms, with
both the target and its antonym modifying instances of the same noun that are in
separate phrases. Some of these sentences have more than one such co-occurrence, so
these sentences yielded 1535 total co-occurrences. Every one of these co-occurrences
had sense-concordant antonyms modifying the same noun; any other sense is usually
semantically incongruous, especially in direct phrasal substitutions. The sentences in
which co-occurring antonymous adjectives modify the same noun therefore constitute
a subcorpus in which the ambiguous members of the antonym pairs are discriminated
relative to their antonym-specific senses. This gave us ten subcorpora, one for each
antonym pair, of 1535 examples to use as a database for studying the extent to which
modified nouns disambiguate their modifying adjectives.
In counting instances of nouns associated with each adjective, elided nouns and
anaphoric pronouns were resolved (manually) whenever possible, adding to the counts
for the noun referent, since we are studying the phenomenon of the adjective–noun
relation. In addition, we stripped morphological suffixes from noun phrases, to recover
an adjective–noun base. Thus right winger, right fielder, and heavy sleeper are recognized
as deriving from right wing, right field, and heavy sleep; short-staffed, short-lived, and light
industrial are recognized as derived from short staff, short life, and light industry. It was
counted directly only in non-anaphoric usage. The sentences of this subcorpus contain
1535 such co-occurrences of the target adjectives and their antonyms. (Co-occurrence
counts for each of the ten antonym pairs are given in Table 3 of the Appendix.)

4.2 Specificity of Nouns for Adjective Senses in the Disambiguated Subcorpora
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.970824761904762">
The disambiguated subcorpora can be used to assess the extent to which target adjec-
tives, when modifying a given noun, are specific to a single sense rather than being
usable in either sense. They are in fact surprisingly consistent in this regard, as can be
illustrated for the indicator nouns discussed in Section 2. There it was noted that man
is an indicator of the &apos;aged&apos; sense of old (with antonym young) and house for some of
the &apos;not new&apos; senses of old (with antonym new).
The specific association of man with the &apos;aged&apos; sense of old is reflected in the use
of this noun in antonymic constructions. The APHB Corpus contains 64 sentences in
which both young and old modify man; e.g.,
In Bihzad&apos;s paintings we see people and animals as individuals—rich men and poor
men, old and young, the elders in the mosque and the herdsmen camping among their
horses in the fields.
Old men saw visions and young men dreamed dreams.
lam an old man, you a young one; . . .
The old man turns to the young one and says: &amp;quot;The time has come for a few
questions.&amp;quot;
In both the old and the young man this was a breach of habit.
Most of these sentences involve phrasal substitution patterns typical of antonyms
generally. In contrast, there is not one sentence in which both old and new modify

The converse result obtains in the case of house. Four sentences contain instances
in which old and new both modify house or houses:
Cast-iron balustrades became the fashion, to be sought out when old houses were
pulled down and removed to new houses. . .
. . . entire crates of dishes have been smashed when the trailers cross railroad tracks or
other rough spots located between the old and the new house.
Fireplaces in the new house, but not in the old one?
Section 235 (of the Housing Act of 1968) helps families with low and &amp;quot;moderate&amp;quot;
incomes to buy one- or two-family houses, old or new.
In contrast, the APHB Corpus contains no sentence in which both old and young modify
house or houses.
The specificity of man and house to particular senses of old is typical of nouns
in these subcorpora. Most nouns by far were modified by the target in only one
of its senses, in our co-occurrence sentences. We demonstrated this sense specificity
of modified nouns by compiling all pairs consisting of a target adjective modifying
the same noun as either of its antonyms. For each of these adjective–noun pairs, we
determined the number of instances involving each sense; we want to determine the
extent to which a particular adjective–noun pair tends to occur with only one of the
two senses. One hundred and eighty-one adjective–noun pairs occur more than once;
with a total of 1096 occurrences. Most by far have 11 : 0 sense distributions, i.e., the
pairs occur in only one of the target&apos;s senses. Sixty-one adjective–noun pairs, covering
828 instances, have 4 or more instances each, and thus could admit 2 or more instances
in their minority sense. Only 4 do have so many minority instances, covering 39 of the
828 total occurrences. The occurrence of 2 or more minority instances is not mainly a
frequency effect; these 4 adjective–noun pairings are no more frequent on average than
those that do not. So adjective–noun pairs do, as a rule, strongly favor one particular
sense, and this is as true of pairs with many instances as of those with few.

4.3 Adjective Disambiguation Using Indicator Nouns
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999983071428571">
The specificity of nouns in the disambiguated corpus for senses of the target adjectives
suggests potentially very high reliability for a noun-based procedure to disambiguate
common adjectives. We evaluate the potential of such a procedure by extracting, from
the co-occurrence sentences, a set of nouns that are indicators for the senses of the
target adjectives and applying them to instances of the targets from non–co-occurrence
sentences in the corpus at large.
Because adjectives co-occur with their antonyms fairly frequently, it was practi-
cal to extract disambiguated subcorpora large enough to provide a base for statistical
inference. However, subcorpora in which most sentences exhibit phrasal substitution
of antonyms are clearly not representative samples of the use of the target adjectives.
This raises the possibility that the specificity of nouns for target adjective senses might
be influenced by the nature of the sentences in which they occur—those that contain
largely repeated, contrastive structures; we need evidence concerning their sense speci-
ficity from the corpus at large. This unrepresentativeness also introduces bias into the

statistical process of inferring sense indicators for the corpus at large from the spe-
cially selected subcorpora, a bias for which we must correct. The Appendix gives the
formula needed to project, from the disambiguated subcorpora to the corpus at large,
the probability of each sense of the target adjective given the noun it modifies. This
adjustment for bias requires that we know the sense distribution of the target adjec-
tives in the corpus to which the indicators are intended to apply and the number of
instances in the subcorpora in which each potential indicator noun is modified by the
target adjective in each of its senses.
We therefore extracted from the APHB Corpus a random sample of 100 sentences
containing adjectival instances of each target adjective, for a total of 500 sentences in
all. In addition to requiring that the target word functions as an adjective, we exclude
all freezes,4 as well as quantificational expressions such as three years old in which the
target labels an attribute (e.g., age) rather than a value of that attribute (e.g., &apos;aged&apos;).5
The target adjectives in all 500 test sentences were manually disambiguated, both with
respect to the antonyms and in some cases with respect to other senses not associated
with either antonym. The distribution of antonym-related senses is given in the third
column of Table 1. Since we are interested in discriminating between the two antonym-
related sets of senses of the targets, we limited attention to those instances of that target
occurring in a sense for which an antonym exists. For this reason, the total number
of instances is less than 100 for each target adjective, varying from 89 for hard to 99
for right. After determining the sense distribution for the target in each set, we could
project which nouns in the subcorpora are likely to be sense indicators for the target
adjectives in these samples.
The following nouns were projected to show a preference for one or the other
sense of the target adjectives that was statistically significant at the .05 level (nouns
are in roman, classes in italic):

The statistical procedure that was used to identify these nouns as indicators is de-
scribed in detail in the Appendix. The number of significant indicators recovered is
quite variable, ranging from none for the &apos;not soft&apos; sense of hard, the &apos;not dark&apos; sense
of light, and the &apos;not tall&apos; sense of short, to 13 for the &apos;not young&apos; sense of old and 20
for the &apos;not wrong&apos; sense of right.
At this point, we had extracted a small set of statistically significant nouns that are
projected to be indicators for adjective senses in the random samples. We then iden-
tified each instance in these samples in which a target adjective modified a projected
indicator and tested the agreement of the target&apos;s sense with that which the noun
was projected to indicate. This procedure tests the sense specificity of the projected
indicators in the 100-sentence samples.
The results of this test appear in Table 1 under the heading Indicator Nouns. The
indicators do turn out to discriminate as projected between target adjective senses, and
they do so with 100% reliability. Given this result, the set of indicator nouns can be
treated as the basis for a disambiguation procedure. The extent of applicability of such
a procedure can be inferred from the Coverage column, which records the proportion
of target adjectives that modify projected indicator nouns. Overall coverage is 26.6%
(see Table 1), rather low for a disambiguation procedure. The amount of co-occurrence
data available for inference has had a substantial effect on coverage. Five of the ten
senses are represented by fewer than 100 co-occurrence sentences each, and only one
of these five yields any coverage at all. The other five senses are represented by more
than 100 sentences each, and every one provides some coverage of the 100-sentence
samples. There is therefore every reason to believe that coverage would increase with a
larger base for inference. While we found a good semantic matching of adjective senses
with the indicators that were recovered from the co-occurrence sentences, the indica-
tor selection depended on an arbitrarily selected 5% level of statistical significance.
We therefore investigated the dependence of performance on the chosen significance
level. This dependence is highlighted most clearly by comparing the performance of

the statistically significant indicators, listed above, with that of the nouns from the
subcorpora that are not significant as indicators of target sense. For this purpose, we
therefore treated every noun from the co-occurrence sentences as an indicator of the
sense which that noun is projected to favor in the sample sentences. The results are
presented under All Nouns in Table 1. Coverage increased from 126 to 237 instances.
The 111 newly covered instances are incorrectly assigned in only 7 cases; even when ev-
ery noun from the co-occurrence sentences is treated as an indicator, reliability remains
high (97.0%).
The rather high reliability of even those nouns that are not statistically significant
indicators of adjective sense suggests that in general text as well as in the co-occurrence
sentences, most nouns are highly specific to the sense of their modifying adjectives.
For example, not a single color word is a statistically significant indicator for the sense
of light, although light blue, light brown, light gray, and light green all clearly use light in
its &apos;not dark&apos; sense. This example also illustrates that many of the individual nouns
that we are treating as separate, independent cases actually manifest a smaller number
of underlying semantic categories, e.g., color. Speakers&apos; knowledge of language must
somehow encode such cases, with patterns of use of individual nouns in relation to
these adjectives emerging on the basis of that knowledge. A natural way to pursue
the necessary revision is in terms of semantic attributes of these nouns, rather than
in terms of the nouns themselves. We investigate this possibility, introspectively, in
Section 4.4. This was already done to some extent when proper names were grouped
together into classes.
The modified noun is not always relevant to the process of disambiguation, and
even when the noun is relevant, it is not always sufficient. The observed errors illus-
trate this (underlined nouns are from the projected indicators):

What are the sources of these errors? In the first sentence, something is not modified

4.4 Generalizing the Indicator Nouns
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995058523809524">
The mutual relevance of nouns and adjectives that permits sense disambiguation is
concept specific rather than word specific. More than 40 nouns that are identifiable as
indicators of adjective senses reflect a much smaller number of conceptual categories
that directly relate to these senses.
4.4.1 Indicator Noun Attributes. The feature human provides a useful and concep-
tually well-motivated basis for interpreting old, right, and short. With one exception
(wine), the projected indicator nouns for the &apos;aged&apos; sense of old—man, people, woman,
you, he, person, lady, and proper names of people—refer to human beings. Expanding
to include all nouns from the co-occurrence sentences that substitute young more than
new for old, almost all added nouns continue to be for human beings, as well as certain
pronouns (I, we, you, he, she and me, us, her, him), to which animals, plants, and body
parts are added. In the 100-sentence sample, all of the 10 &apos;aged&apos; instances of old that
were not covered by the indicator nouns refer to members of these categories, 7 of
them to human beings. Similarly, the correctness sense of right refers both to deci-
sions and to decision-making entities, the latter primarily human; among 119 different
nouns modified by right in the co-occurrence sentences, 14 of the nouns modified by
&apos;not wrong&apos; instances are +human, and all 55 nouns modified by &apos;not left&apos; instances are
—human. Finally, in the case of short, the vertical extent feature characterizing its &apos;not
tall&apos; sense is appropriate to relatively freestanding entities that are normally vertical,
and humans are the most talked-about instances of such objects generally. There are
differences among the different target adjectives in the appropriateness of the feature.
In the case of old, it is a restricted version of the feature living thing; for right, of
animate (people and animals); and for short, human beings happen to be a frequent
instantiation of a verticality feature that is normally appropriate to woody plants and
to relatively large land animals.
The feature concrete is also very widely applicable. All indicators of the &apos;not soft&apos;
sense of hard are +concrete, so —concrete reliably indicates the &apos;not easy&apos; sense of
hard. Because hard in its &apos;not easy&apos; sense also modifies concrete nouns syntactically,
on the surface (though not semantically; see Section 5), +concrete does not as reliably
indicate the &apos;not soft&apos; sense of hard. Similarly, —concrete indicates the &apos;not wrong&apos;
senses of right, the &apos;not long&apos; senses of short, and the &apos;gentle&apos; subset of the &apos;not heavy&apos;
senses of light. It also indicates &apos;not new&apos; senses of old, but in this case —concrete is
simply a special case of —animate.
Another widely relevant class of indicators are body parts. These indicate the &apos;not
young&apos; sense of old and the &apos;not long&apos; sense of short. A substantial subset of them indi-
cate the directional sense of right. This sense is associated with horizontally separated
members of (mostly inherently) paired, repeated entities; it is appropriate to horizon-
tally separated, paired body parts—eyes, ears, thumbs, hands, wrists, arms, legs, feet,
etc.—which constitute the majority of nouns, by text frequency, that are modified by
the &apos;not left&apos; sense of right. For noninherently paired entities, more complex phras-
ings such as on the right or rightmost are used instead (also on the left or leftmost). Body
parts are less well represented in the co-occurrence sentences for hard; those that occur

(shell, palate, tissue) are sense specific for &apos;not soft,&apos; being specific cases of +concrete
and subject to the reservations on +concrete indicator nouns noted above.
Other semantic features are more restricted to individual adjective senses. The
attribute +color disambiguates about half of the &apos;not dark&apos; instances of light. Length-
related (&apos;not long&apos;) senses of short are indicated by nouns that are +time period (term,
period, day, duration, minute, month, night, time, weekend, in the co-occurrence sentences),
but this attribute is subsumable under —concrete. Text/utterance type (e.g., story, note,
book, manuscript, monolog, phrase, speech, stanza), though largely subsumable under
—concrete, often have +concrete realizations (as for book, note, manuscript).
Some highly specific attributes are clearly relevant; for example, +military entity
(cruiser, carrier, gun, arms, armor, dragoon, flak, machine gun, missile) indicates the &apos;not
heavy&apos; sense of light, and +mental (answer, decision, reason, theory, argument, assump-
tion, conclusion, conviction, guess, method, notion, opinion, policy, prediction, proposition,
question) indicates &apos;not wrong&apos; senses of right. Until many more adjectives have been
investigated, we avoid introducing overly specific features whose range, applicabil-
ity, and definition may be unclear. These are perhaps subsumable under more general
attributes. This is the case for +mental, a special case of a highly reliable and more gen-
eral indicator, —concrete (see Section 5.2 concerning the more complex case of military
entity and the relation of text type, which we do use, to the time period attribute).
In some cases, semantic features such as those discussed above can be used
straightforwardly as sense indicators, just as nouns were. For example, a +human
noun indicates the &apos;not tall&apos; sense of short; a —concrete noun indicates a &apos;not long&apos;
sense of short. In other cases, however, the move from specific nouns to semantic fea-
tures as sense indicators necessitates the formulation of more specific rules for using
them. For example, —concrete nouns indicate a &apos;not heavy&apos; sense of light, except that
—concrete nouns that are +color indicate its &apos;not dark&apos; sense. This requires a formu-
lation using either feature combinations or rule ordering. We can implement this by
first attempting to apply a rule +color = &apos;not dark&apos; and then attempting to apply a
rule —concrete = &apos;not heavy&apos;, to any unresolved cases (Table 2). More complex rules
can be expected to be required in other cases.
We do not propose, in general, to extract automatically either semantic general-
izations like those discussed above, or the rules that use them. Informed introspective
analysis, aided by a perusal of corpora, seems a surer way toward rule-based for-
mulations. Human analysis and understanding are simply richer than the mechanical
statistical tools and data sources presently available for arriving at such rules.

evant and indicator nouns are readily recovered, Section 4.4.1 shows that coverage can
be increased by exploiting specific indicator nouns in order to infer or to extract au-
tomatically general semantic attributes of nouns. For some of the indicators, however,
generalization properly takes another course, leading not to semantic but to syntac-
tic cues for sense identification. For example, predicate adjective usage indicates the
correctness sense of right, which is clearly manifested throughout the APHB Corpus.

sense of right. This indicator is found in statements of the form It BE ADJ + infinitival
clause, where BE is a form of the verb to be. Auxiliary verbs, adverbials, or negation
occurs optionally in these statements, and the infinitival clause need not follow imme-
diately. It is often deleted, and in such cases an anaphoric pronoun may replace the
non-anaphoric it, resolving to a preceding or following clause. Also, the verb BE may
be deleted and the entire construction subordinated to a higher verb such as seems or
becomes. We refer to these as cases of an infinitival indicator feature.

It&apos;s sometimes hard for a motorist to pass a young fellow standing on the

Since he&apos;s doing this for his physical welfare, it wouldn&apos;t be right of me to let
him be bothered.
A result of this pattern is that almost any verb will look like an indicator for these
same senses of hard and right.&apos; This appearance, however, is spurious. The proper
generalization is simply the syntactic construction, including its variants in which
the non-anaphoric it does not occur. The variants include those in which the entire
infinitival clause, or a gerundive phrase based on it, serves as the subject of the main
clause, with hard or right as predicate adjective,
But becoming more independent is hard for many children.
and those in which a noun object from the infinitival clause is promoted to serve as
subject of the verb of being, in place of it.
Later, Mama may have regretted being married, because Papa was so hard
to understand.
Her energy was tremendous, her scruples hard to find.
Since the adjective is characterizing an action or state of affairs, these cases can be sub-
sumed under the +activity or —concrete semantic attributes discussed in Section 4.4.1
as indicators of these senses of hard and right. Even as a premodifier of a noun, the
adjectives in this construction often relate semantically to the verb phrase, e.g.,
This is a hard program to carry out.
What is hard is the carrying out of the program, not the program itself. Once again, it
is the syntactic construction, and not the modified noun, that is the relevant indicator.
These considerations help us to refine our use of the adjective—noun relation itself
and to put it on a firmer linguistic footing. The adjective—noun relation is directly per-
tinent to semantic attributes of both the adjective and the noun only when there is a
deep syntactic relation between them. In the case of the infinitival and related construc-
tions, no such relation holds; the noun modified by the adjective at the surface level

infinitival constructions.

is irrelevant. A principled approach to adjective disambiguation using nouns there-
fore requires a determination that the adjective modifies the noun at a deep syntactic
level. It is therefore important to take into account the infinitival construction prior to
disambiguating any adjective—even those for which it does not constitute an indicator.
The last two columns of Table 1 present the results of adjective disambiguation by
a combination of syntactic and semantic indicator attributes. The disambiguating rules
we used are given in Table 2. The syntactic indicator attributes, predicative and infiniti-
val, were applied first. Afterward, if a target adjective sense was not resolved, semantic
indicator attributes were applied; no individual indicator nouns were used. The se-
mantic attributes that were applied were animate, body part, color, concrete, human,
and text type; Church and Hanks (1989) had pointed to two of these attributes, person
and body part (also time, previously mentioned above) in a seemingly casual listing
of just five attributes potentially useful for describing the lexico—syntactic regularities
of noun—verb relations.
Table 1 shows that these few, general attributes cover almost three-quarters of
all instances of the target adjectives. Disambiguation by these syntactic and semantic
attributes is effectively as reliable as disambiguation using significant indicator nouns:
having three apparent errors in disambiguation is not significantly worse than the
errorless performance of the significant indicator nouns in the 100-sentence samples.
In fact, under a deeper analysis, these three cases are consistent with the pertinent
attributes and should not be treated as errors at all. In one sentence,
In contrast to his rangy sons, he was a short, heavy, oaken-barrel sort of man.
short modifies sort (—concrete) and was thus assigned the sense &apos;not long.&apos; However,
it is actually relevant not to the head of the noun phrase, sort, but rather to man
(+ animate); so treated, short would be correctly assigned to &apos;not tall.&apos; More complex are
the two instances of old wine. In the APHB Corpus at large, the new/old contrast applied
to wine relates chiefly to contexts of production of the wine or of the introduction
of a type of wine. The young/old contrast relates instead to the maturation of some
wines, or more generally, to the developmental phases through which wine passes
while aging over a period of years. It is a cultural (and thus semantic) fact that wines
and other nonanimate entities that undergo developmental changes and pass through
maturational stages are treated as living things. Since the two instances of wine in the
100-sentence samples are of this sort, their old modifiers are properly assigned to &apos;not
young&apos;; we assigned them to &apos;not new&apos; under a literal interpretation of —animate.
The rules in Table 2 can be easily implemented. The approach presupposes that
the natural language processing system within which it is applied includes a reliable,
wide-coverage parser to determine the noun phrase modified by an adjective and
the head of that noun phrase. The lexical database used by this parser must include
semantic attribute tags. Most of those used in this paper are already present in some
available machine-readable dictionaries, such as the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary
English. Such a disambiguation procedure is capable of disambiguating, with very
high reliability, about three-quarters of the 100-sentence sample instances of the target
adjectives we have investigated.

covered cases. Some are readily characterized in terms of the general approach of the
previous section; others are more complex.
The following discussion treats the kinds of properties that systematically relate
adjective senses to other features of the sentences in which they occur. Unlike the
previous section, it does not point to any automated procedure to take advantage of
these properties, or to the role they might play in some more encompassing procedure,
and it uses coverage and reliability as measures of the actual association of adjective
senses with other constructs, irrespective of their recoverability from raw text. Thus,
this section is concerned with the nature of underlying relations—not with formulating
a disambiguation procedure.
5.1 Indicator Noun Sense Attributes
We have found that a substantial proportion of adjectives can be disambiguated by the
nouns they modify, largely on the basis of general semantic attributes characterizing
those nouns. These attributes, being semantic, must relate in fact to noun senses and
not to nouns per se. This issue is finessed, to some extent, in the projected indicator
nouns and thus in our application of attributes based on them. Some attributes happen
to apply to all senses of a given noun. For example, in the 100-sentence samples, course
disambiguates short, though once it is used for &apos;path&apos; and once for &apos;class,&apos; because both
senses are –concrete. Some indicator nouns were extracted, not because the attribute
applies to all senses of these nouns, but because these nouns are used far more often in
senses to which an indicator attribute applies than in those to which it does not apply.
For example, people shows a statistically significant tendency to be associated with the
&apos;aged&apos; (&apos;not young&apos;) senses of old (when people is the plural of person), as judged from
the co-occurrence sentences, although one instance of the &apos;of long standing&apos; (&apos;not new&apos;)
senses of old (when people meant &apos;ethnic group&apos;) was also found.

<bodyText confidence="0.996372823529412">
In many instances in the 100-sentence samples, the noun modified by a target
adjective was ambiguous with respect to one of the indicator attributes: an indicator
attribute did characterize some of the noun&apos;s common senses, but not others. For
example, the noun side is projected to occur equally often with each sense of right (&apos;not
left&apos; 49.9%, &apos;not wrong&apos; 50.1%). However, this noun has two broad classes of meanings:
one refers to commitments on issues and is —concrete; the other refers to flanks and
is +concrete. As expected on the basis of this semantic attribute, right usually means
&apos;not left&apos; when it modifies side in its (locational) sense &apos;flank,&apos; but virtually always
means &apos;not wrong&apos; when modifying side in its commitment sense. The sense of side is
therefore a more reliable indicator of the sense of right than is the noun itself.
If these nouns are disambiguated with respect to the relevant attribute, reliability
can be increased, as in the case of right side. Coverage will increase as well. Some nouns
have two or more common senses that disagree in the value of relevant attributes and
thus were not recovered as indicator nouns; their senses might well be reliable indicator
features. Disagreements in the value of a semantic attribute for a given noun can even
be systematic. Any noun N with sense S can be used to mean &apos;a type of S,&apos; as with
family doctor in

When types are construed as —concrete, as when referring to roles, such uses are
specific to &apos;not new&apos; senses of old (and to &apos;not wrong&apos; senses of right). Thus, any noun
or semantic attribute that is associated with the alternative senses of these adjectives
would be wrongly interpreted when a &apos;type of S&apos; usage of the noun is not recognized.
Another widely pertinent example is the more complex ambiguity in the reference
of modified nouns for roles or relationships. A role noun almost always refers to an
individual (+animate) who stands in that relationship to another, as in all the example
sentences cited below; for example, when the nuns, new and old, filed out of the cloister,
it was a set of persons and not of relationships who did so. The adjective, however,
may apply to that individual (a +animate noun sense) or to the role itself (a —animate
noun sense). Thus, the adjective old may apply either to the relationship or to the role
designated by doctor, friend, empress, and nun, with old having the sense &apos;former&apos; or &apos;of
long standing&apos;:
. . . I was with old friends; I had made new friends; and that night I think that I was
lonelier than ever before.
It was only to be expected that the lords and ladies of the court would compare the first
wife and the second, the old empress and the new. . . all in favor of the old.
A prayer, the Bishop&apos;s blessing—and the nuns, new and old, filed out to the cloister.
or to a person having that relationship or role, with old having the sense &apos;aged&apos;:
. . . he rang to six friends, not too young, not too old, and explained that he&apos;d have to
postpone their dinner.
The old doctor and the young doctor rode in silence for two miles and indulged in
their memories.
On the contrary, these nuns, young and old, were invariably cheerful and happy,
almost gay and full of childish fun and laughter. . .

There is an inherent ambiguity concerning the relation of the adjective old to its noun:
the referent of the noun is an individual (which is +animate), but it is an associated
noun sense to which the adjective applies (which may be +animate or –animate) that
strictly determines the sense of old. In the 100-sentence samples, when old modifies a
role noun, it always applies in its &apos;aged&apos; sense to the individual and in its &apos;former&apos;
sense to the role. Some role/relationship nouns are used overwhelmingly in their role
senses (as with friend) or in their personal senses (as with doctor). Otherwise, inferring
the correct sense for old involves a resolution of the function of the noun. For example,
an old forest is &apos;not new&apos; if it has existed for a great period of time and &apos;not young&apos; if it
is in an advanced stage of development in the life cycle of forests (cf., the discussion
of wine in Section 4.4.2).
This semantic ambiguity in the noun sense to which the adjective applies can
therefore be resolved by the same rules formulated for unambiguous cases, once the
relevant noun sense is identified. How to access the relevant noun sense is an unsolved
problem: the noun&apos;s direct referent is an individual, whereas the semantic structure en-
tailed by the noun is a semantic network, and the adjective may apply to the network&apos;s
noun sense nodes rather than to the noun referent itself. The utility and elegance of
such semantic representations is suggested by linguistic discussions on lexical seman-
tics. They have been used with notable success by Fillmore and Atkins (1991), who
exploit the intricacies of such networks in a now-classic account of the semantics of
risk, with different nodes of the network providing the locus of what might be dis-
tilled as the word&apos;s distinct senses. Similar network representations are adopted and
implemented in restricted domains in several computational models (e.g., Sowa 1986).
The semantics of noun senses therefore relate more specifically and directly to
adjective senses than do nouns themselves; in fact, 38 (30%) of the 125 cases not
covered by the rules of Table 2 are resolved when these broader semantic structures
are used. In most of these cases, noun senses themselves supplied the attributes used
by the rules of Table 2 to disambiguate adjectives. In other cases, such as role nouns,
with more complex semantic structures, we are able to resolve the semantic relation
of adjective and noun, but this ability cannot be captured in rules as simple as those
of Table 2.

5.2 Other Indicators of Adjective Senses
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.88426475">
Section 4 showed that indicator nouns and, in particular, certain of their semantic
features are quite reliable as bases for interpreting the meanings of the adjectives that
modify them. In some cases, however, nouns provided very little assistance—when
the pertinent semantic and syntactic features do not apply, the same noun is often
simply consistent with alternative senses. This was systematically true for relationship
nouns modified by old. Similarly, the adjective light can refer either to weight or to
color in modifying most concrete nouns.
In these cases, disambiguation involves words other than the noun that the target
adjective modifies, standing in other syntactic relations to the target. The effectiveness
of one such alternative has already been demonstrated—the special case of antonymic
adjectives. In the special constructions discussed in Section 3 and, in particular, when
they modify the same noun, they disambiguate one another with almost perfect reli-
ability. Consider, for example, the sentence
A piece will seldom bake uniformly, even with the most loving attention—that is, it
will vary from light to very dark. . .
The target adjective light modifies the pronoun it, which refers anaphorically back to

piece (of food being baked). Light pieces of food may be either &apos;not dark&apos; or &apos;not heavy,&apos;
so the noun provides no substantial aid to interpretation. However, the phrase from
light to dark secures the intended sense of light.
Verb senses can relate systematically to adjective senses, because adjectives often
designate attributes pertinent to the application of the verbal action to/by the referent
of the modified object/subject noun. Verbs are therefore useful to the interpretation of
adjectives modifying subject or object nouns. Returning to the difficult case of light,
one of the 7 sentences in which an error was made when all nouns were treated as
indicators (see Section 4.3) is
A spatula is also used for lifting light pieces of food. . .
In this sentence, the head noun pieces is irrelevant, essentially empty semantically. The
critical noun is food, but it is not a directly usable indicator; light food may be either
&apos;not heavy,&apos; as in this sentence, or &apos;not dark,&apos; as in the previous example. It is instead
the verb lifting that provides the best sentence-internal indication of the &apos;weight&apos; sense
of light in the example under consideration. The 5 APHB sentences that refer to the
lifting of a light object all involve the &apos;not heavy&apos; sense of light. This is not a logical
requirement—both dark and heavy objects are also said to be lifted. But the weight of
an object is intrinsically relevant and its color irrelevant to the lifting of hat object; a
reference to the lifting of a light N in the &apos;not dark&apos; sense is likely to be misconstrued
unless additional cues to interpretation are provided. Similar results are found for
semantically similar verbs. Thus, carry disambiguates light in
Furniture movers, for example, carry light objects in their hands.
whereas the modified noun is of no help. Accordingly, physically supports is a seman-
tic attribute of some indicator verbs for the &apos;not heavy&apos; sense of light.
In some cases when a noun or even a noun sense is consistent with more than
one sense of the target adjective that modifies it, a default target sense may be reliably
inferred so long as there is no strong counter-evidence in the immediate context. Old
doctor, for example, means &apos;aged doctor&apos; in 28 of 30 instances in our corpus. The other
2 cases are both for old family doctor. In one, the sentence itself makes it clear that
a generic &apos;type of doctor&apos; sense was intended (see Section 5.1). Similarly, old means
&apos;former&apos; in the sentence
I know that the old family doctor, Dr. Schlomm, always told Manya she could be
stabilized on medication, that she could be kept under control.
as shown by the immediately following sentence:
So did her present doctor.
A more complex example of default inference is provided by right as a modifier of side.
The commitment sense of side strongly favors the correctness sense of right, whereas
the locational senses of side favor the directional senses of right. However, even with
the locational sense of side, &apos;not wrong&apos; is not an anomalous usage. Compare, for
example, the following sentences from the APHB Corpus:
They were hiding behind the big oak on the left side of the road.

Zaza still stood in the road, on the wrong side of the car.
</tableCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.960237243902439">
In the face of such examples, it becomes difficult to interpret the adjective in such
sentences as
But the car, now on the right [not left] side of the road, was too late to veer away from
the second tire.. .
He was on the right [not wrong] side of the screen, he had an excellent day&apos;s work
behind him, and in two minutes&apos; time he would hear Bing Crosby sing.
except with respect to the broader discourse context. In our data, locational senses of
side always involve the directional sense of right in right side of unless there is decisive
evidence to the contrary in the same sentence or in the immediately surrounding
discourse. In many of the directional sense uses, we find no overt clue within the
sentence or the immediate discourse to determine the sense; it appears to be simply
the assumed interpretation when no specific information contradicts it. In contrast,
for each of the (6 out of 45) instances in which a correctness sense of right modifies a
locational sense of side in right side of, there is something explicit in the near context,
usually in the same sentence. For example, the ambiguous case of the right side of the
screen, above, is resolved by a preceding sentence (two short sentences intervene):
Across the centre of the hall hung a screen, and on this screen was being projected a
motion picture; half the men had to see the picture back to front, because they had to look
at it from the back [the wrong side] of the screen, but nobody minded that very much.
The directional sense of right cannot be construed as a general default, since the cor-
rectness sense is far more common overall. Evidently, the locational sense of side of
is so powerful a semantic indicator for the directional sense of right that people do
not use right side of in other senses without providing substantial countervaling evi-
dence for the sense. Relative to a given indicator noun, then, it makes sense to think
of adjective disambiguation in terms of default interpretations.
Some noun-based disambiguation of adjectives involves the noun&apos;s functionality
rather than its intrinsic semantic attributes; many such nouns relate to relevant at-
tributes of indicator verbs. The adjective light, when modifying a +concrete noun, is a
case in point. Both weight and color characterize all +concrete entities. In fact, how-
ever, we can reliably determine the sense of light in a number of these cases. Three
nouns in the co-occurrence sentences emerged as significant indicators for the &apos;not
heavy&apos; sense of light—cruiser, load, and harness. It is the weight and not the color of a
load that is functionally relevant; the thickness and thus weight of a harness that bears
on the speed and load-bearing potential of the draught animals fitted with it; and the
heaviness of a vessel that is relevant to the speed, ease of handling, load-bearing po-
tential, and imperviousness to damage that is pertinent to military cruisers. In fact, if
it were necessary to specify such entities as being light in color, we would expect that
their functional specificity for lightness in weight would lead to the use of a more spe-
cific qualifier, such as light-colored, rather than simply light. Semantic attributes such as
carried things would characterize nouns such as load, e.g., burden, cargo, or freight, and
load-bearing equipment or load-relevant equipment would characterize nouns such as

harness and cruiser. In the sample of sentences containing light, the following might be
subsumed under such attributes: aircraft, brigade, car, cart, defense, guard, horse, industry,
package, shell, tank, and weight. Some of these, such as shell and tank, have meanings
to which the load-bearing issue is not relevant, though in the case of tank the appli-
cation of the adjective light does appear to restrict its referent to the military vehicle.
Others, such as car, involve issues of fashion and decoration to which color and thus
darkness is potentially relevant as well, although the 5 instances of light car(s) in our
corpus do refer to weight (with dark car(s) referring to a darkened interior). But suit-
ably constrained either to subsets in which decoration is not a functional value (e.g.,
military/industrial equipment) or by treating feature combinations that include, e.g.,
—decorative relevance, it would be possible if not ideal to handle such nouns in terms
of attribute values. Thus, some nouns can be disambiguated by relatively narrowly
defined semantic classes, such as military/industrial equipment, and with high relia-
bility, leading to something close to lexicalized noun phrases, e.g., light cruiser or light
industry. But it is in fact the functional relevance of heaviness versus darkness in the
context of its use that is actually involved.
A more complex example is provided by those indicators for the &apos;not long&apos; sense
of short that are types of texts or utterances—book, manuscript, monologue, note, phrase,
poem, speech, stanza, story, and syllable. These, like +time period, are largely subsumable
under the —concrete feature, but there are also +concrete instances of some of these
nouns, such as book, that still select the &apos;not long&apos; sense of short. In these instances, it is
not a physical dimension of the item that is short, and reference to such dimensions in
the case of book relates instead to the &apos;not tall&apos; sense of short. Superficially, this might
support the pertinence of a special attribute, textual, for disambiguating short. How-
ever, the &apos;not long&apos; characterization of shortness of texts refers explicitly or implicitly
to the duration of the performance (e.g., reading or reciting) of the text. Accordingly, it
is the time period attribute that would appear to be involved in this case—an attribute
of activities that constitute the typical use of texts, not an attribute of texts themselves.
The relationship involved in this case is comparable to that discussed by Pustejovsky
and Boguraev (1993), in which a single sense of fast relates speed of vehicle motion in
both fast car and fast highway via the qualia structure of lexical entries for highway and
car. Accordingly, although most instances of nouns for text types can disambiguate
short by being —concrete, the principled basis for disambiguating the adjective entails
a more complex type of inference than simple characterization of semantic attributes
of the modified noun itself.

6. Concluding Remarks
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999712923076923">
For the adjectives and adjective senses under study, it has been demonstrated that the
noun modified by an adjective provides, in most cases, an extremely reliable indication
of the sense of that adjective. General semantic attributes of the modified noun provide
equally reliable and more widely applicable indications of adjective meanings. These
attributes are conceptually relevant and compact ways of representing the semantic
relation between adjectives and their modified nouns. When the noun is such that
it does not disambiguate the adjective, other words in other specific relations often
provide this information. Once again, these words reflect semantic classes rather than
specific lexical items and provide a compact and meaningful semantic characterization
of the relation of the adjective to the related word class.
This work also supports the view that a small number of close syntactic relations
channel much of the semantic interpretation involved in disambiguation, at least in
the case of sense dichotomies in adjectives. We suspect that when this highly struc-

tured type of evidence is removed, the more diffuse kinds of clues implicit in mass
contextual comparison approaches still have a principled role in disambiguation, e.g.,
by providing a generalized feel for the overall topical preferences of target senses.
The data on which this study is based were analyzed statistically, and our re-
sults were summarized quantitatively. These analyses, however, were not provided in
anticipation of the creation of statistical procedures for automated word sense disam-
biguation, but rather to help us to explore and to establish a property of language—that
general semantic attributes of noun senses correlate with the senses of the adjectives
that modify these nouns. The phenomenon itself can now be formulated in nonquanti-
tative terms. In addressing or utilizing this phenomenon, corpora remain quite useful,
supplying examples of word use that can be used for insight and serious discourse
analysis.
The main goals of this paper were to investigate conceptual issues in adjective
disambiguation. The above results, however, may provide a basis for a useful core
component of an automated procedure that disambiguates adjectives, with the rest
to be covered by an auxiliary procedure. This core component&apos;s coverage of three-
quarters of adjective instances is lower than can be attained by other approaches, even
those with quite high reliability. Nonetheless, such a core has practical advantages:
when it is applicable, it is virtually errorless; and if there are errors, it is known where
they will be concentrated—in the remaining quarter of cases, those resolved by the
auxiliary procedure. The full procedure can then attain a 97-98% reliability level even
if the auxiliary procedure has only 90% reliability.
The results of this study need to be extended in several ways. First, they should be
extended to cover a substantial number of adjectives. Any such enterprise always leads
to improved understanding, but there is also reason to believe that the results will be
comparable to those we report. The five adjectives investigated in this paper represent
a fair range in terms of difficulty: the relations between the pairs of senses range from
barely distinct (short), to interrelated in complex and sometimes subtle ways (old),
to semantically orthogonal (light). These adjectives are among the most frequent in
English and, correspondingly, are applicable to a variety of nouns, so they may be
on average somewhat more useful than most for investigating the interpretation of
adjectives based upon nouns. It is of course important to investigate types of sense
discriminations other than the antonymically defined pairs that were imposed by the
design of this study.
The results should also be extended to investigate more fully the contributions of
other types of syntactic relations of adjectives. Although it appears that verb-based
disambiguation of adjectives can be formulated in the same way as noun-based dis-
ambiguation, we have not yet systematically studied the contribution of verbs. As in
the case of nouns, we expect the appropriate representation to be in terms of semantic
classes rather than sets of words (cf. Levin 1993). It would also be useful to address
the possible contribution of adjectives other than the sense-specific antonyms.
Finally, the results need to be extended beyond the class of adjectives. Most directly,
nouns are probably as reliably disambiguated by adjectives as adjectives are by nouns.

A.1 Definition
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99335988">
Let T be a target feature of a sentence or other textual unit that is to be disambiguated
with respect to some set of characteristics S1, ..., Sn; in our study, n is 2, and S1 and
S2 are two groups of senses, each group relating semantically to a particular antonym
of a target adjective T. Let F be some feature that can be associated with the target
feature T in the same textual unit; F may in general be any feature of a sentence or
other textual unit that contains T, e.g., a semantic attribute, a word, a phrase, or a
grammatical pattern. In our study, F is a noun modified by a target adjective T. We
abbreviate the event &amp;quot;sense of T = S&amp;quot; as &amp;quot;S&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;F is in the context of T&amp;quot; as &amp;quot;F.&amp;quot;
Then F provides evidence concerning the sense of T if, for some i and j, the conditional
probability P{S I F} is not equal to P{Sj F}. We call F an indicator for the sense S, of
T if the conditional probability of S, given F is higher than the conditional probability
of any other sense given F: P{S, I Fl &gt; P{Sj Fl for all j i.
A.2 Estimation of PIS, Fl
The desired probabilities P{S I F}, i = 1, . ,n, can be estimated from a representative
sample of sentences with T in a corpus. However, a subcorpus in which T is disam-
biguated by a particular set of clues may bias the sense distribution; the desired prob-
abilities differ, in general, from probabilities Q{S I F} defined on such disambiguated
subcorpora. The formula we derive for P{S, Fl takes into account this possible bias.
In the derivation, we use an intuitively reasonable assumption that the occurrence of
a potential indicator feature F depends only upon the sense of the target T with which
it is associated and not upon the fact that it occurs in the subcorpora (in our case,
primarily a phrasal substitution context of antonym co-occurrence sentences), i.e., that
Q{F I S,} = P{F I S1}. This need not be true for arbitrary disambiguating features, but
we treat it as approximately correct in the case of nouns modified by a target adjective.

formula yields simply P{S I F} = Q{S, I F}.

Most of the target adjectives we investigated have a substantial sense bias, because
their antonyms co-occur with them at substantially different rates. When all instances
of F in the disambiguated subcorpora fall in the same sense group, the estimated
probability for that sense given the feature F is 1, regardless of the values of the
biases p,; this was the typical case in our experiment because of the specificity of the
modified nouns (Section 4.2). But whether or not these estimated sense probabilities
are statistically significant does depend on the p, values.

We illustrate the use of the formulas for our data. Let T = old, S1 = &apos;not new,&apos;
S2 = &apos;not young,&apos; and F = friend(s). Because we want to estimate the probabilities
P{S, I Fl for our sample sentences in particular and not for the corpus at large, it is
for these sentences that we determine the P{S,} needed for computing the values of
the p1. The data are given in Table 3. In this table, n1 is the number of instances of
sense 51 of a target in the 100-sentence sample for that target, and n2 is the number
of such instances for the other sense; P{S, I Fl is the corresponding probability of the
sense 5, of the target in the samples. For our example,

The bias ratios for all five pairs of adjective senses in our study are given in Table 3.
The probabilities Q{S1 I F} and Q{52 IF} are estimated from the observed frequencies
in the co-occurrence sentences. Friend or friends is modified by both old and new in 9
sentences and by both old and young in 1 sentence, yielding an estimate of 9/10 for
Q{Si I F} and 1/10 for Q{S2 I F}. Substituting these figures into the formula yields the

While the estimated probabilities of the senses of old when it modifies friend(s) do
differ substantially, these estimates are based on only 10 occurrences of friend(s) in
the co-occurrence sentences. The low number of instances of old modifying friend(s)
raises the possibility that the difference in estimated probabilities might be spurious,
a chance deviation. This section explains how we tested this possibility, i.e., how we
decided whether an observed difference is statistically significant.
Our null hypothesis is that there is no difference between the probabilities P{S1 I Fl
and P{S2 I F}. We test this equiprobability hypothesis using a 5% significance level,
i.e., we reject it if the probability of so large an observed deviation from this hypothesis
is 5% or less. Because we did not specify a hypothetical sense preference in advance
for each word, we use two-tailed tests.

<abstract confidence="0.988224590909091">Recent corpus-based work on word sense disambiguation explores the application of statistical pattern recognition procedures to lexical co-occurrence data from very large text databases. In this paper we argue for a linguistically principled approach to disambiguation, in which relevant contextual clues are narrowly defined, in syntactic and semantic terms, and in which only highly reliable clues are exploited. Statistical methods play a definite role in this work, helping to organize and analyze data, but the disambiguation method itself does not employ statistical data or decision criteria. This approach results in improved understanding of the disambiguation problem both in general and on a word-specific basis and leads to broadly applicable and nearly errorless clues to word sense. The approach is illustrated by an experiment discriminating among the senses of adjectives, which have been relatively neglected in work on sense disambiguation. In particular, the paper assesses the potential of nouns for discriminating among the senses of adjectives that modify them. This assessment is based on an empirical study of five of the most frequent ambiguous in English: light, old, right, three-quarters of all instances of these adjectives can be disambiguated almost errorlessly by the nouns they modify or by the syntactic constructions in which they occur. Such disambiguation requires only simple rules, which can be automated easily. Furthermore, a small number of semantic attributes supply a compact means of representing the noun clues in a very few rules. Clues other than nouns are required when modified nouns are not useable. The sense of an ambiguous modified noun may be needed to determine the relevant semantic attribute for disambiguation of a target adjective; and other adjectives, verbs, and grammatical constructions all show evidence of high reliability, and sometimes of high applicability, when they stand in specific, well-defined syntactic relations to the ambiguous adjective. Some of these clues, however, may be hard to automate.</abstract>

We adopted a different strategy, one that provided us with a large set of sentences in which target adjectives could be disambiguated automatically and with complete reliability. This strategy involved disambiguation of adjectives by their co-occurrence with sense-specific antonyms. Antonym co-occurrence is a frequent and pervasive phenomenon, and it takes place under highly restricted semantic and syntactic conditions (Charles and Miller 1989; Justeson and Katz 1991, 1992). An adjective and its antonym refer to opposed values of the same attribute. When they modify the same noun in a sentence—this is the usual case in sentences in which they both occur—this attribute is virtually ensured of applying in a consistent way to both instances of the noun. When an adjective like old has different senses that are associated with different antonyms (like new and young), the adjective in these sentences is disambiguated by its antonym.

The last two columns of Table 1 present the results of adjective disambiguation by a combination of syntactic and semantic indicator attributes. The disambiguating rules we used are given in Table 2. The syntactic indicator attributes, predicative and infinitival, were applied first. Afterward, if a target adjective sense was not resolved, semantic indicator attributes were applied; no individual indicator nouns were used. The semantic attributes that were applied were animate, body part, color, concrete, human, and text type; Church and Hanks (1989) had pointed to two of these attributes, person and body part (also time, previously mentioned above) in a seemingly casual listing of just five attributes potentially useful for describing the lexico—syntactic regularities of noun—verb relations. Table 1 shows that these few, general attributes cover almost three-quarters of all instances of the target adjectives.

How to access the relevant noun sense is an unsolved problem: the noun&apos;s direct referent is an individual, whereas the semantic structure entailed by the noun is a semantic network, and the adjective may apply to the network&apos;s noun sense nodes rather than to the noun referent itself. The utility and elegance of such semantic representations is suggested by linguistic discussions on lexical semantics. They have been used with notable success by Fillmore and Atkins (1991), who exploit the intricacies of such networks in a now-classic account of the semantics of risk, with different nodes of the network providing the locus of what might be distilled as the word&apos;s distinct senses. Similar network representations are adopted and implemented in restricted domains in several computational models (e.g., Sowa 1986). The semantics of noun senses therefore relate more specifically and directly to adjective senses than do nouns themselves; in fact, 38 (30%) of the 125 cases not covered by the rules of Table 2 are resolved when these broader semantic structures are used.</context>

We adopted a different strategy, one that provided us with a large set of sentences in which target adjectives could be disambiguated automatically and with complete reliability. This strategy involved disambiguation of adjectives by their co-occurrence with sense-specific antonyms. Antonym co-occurrence is a frequent and pervasive phenomenon, and it takes place under highly restricted semantic and syntactic conditions (Charles and Miller 1989; Justeson and Katz 1991, 1992). An adjective and its antonym refer to opposed values of the same attribute. When they modify the same noun in a sentence—this is the usual case in sentences in which they both occur—this attribute is virtually ensured of applying in a consistent way to both instances of the noun. When an adjective like old has different senses that are associated with different antonyms (like new and young), the adjective in these sentences is disambiguated by its antonym. Thus, in sentences 4 John S. Justeson and Slava M. Katz Principled Disambiguation in which old and young modify the same noun, e.g</context>

Simple, broadly applicable semantic features characterize most of the indicator nouns, whereas broadly applicable syntactic features characterize many of their contexts. Together, these features discriminate the target senses, permitting a more compact and conceptual rather than word-specific representation of the indicators (Section 4.4): about three-quarters of the adjective instances are disambiguated by these features, and virtually errorlessly. 4.1 Acquiring Disambiguated Subcorpora Our original study of antonym co-occurrence (Justeson and Katz 1991) was based on a version of the Brown Corpus, containing 54,717 sentences; it yields only 57 sentences in which both adjectives from any of the ten antonym pairs analyzed in the present study were modifying different instances of the same noun. To get enough sentences containing antonym co-occurrences of antonyms to address disambiguation issues adequately, we used the 1.5 million—sentence APHB Corpus. This corpus of 25,000,000 words was obtained from the American Printing House for the Blind and archived at IBM&apos;s T.J. Watson Research Center. It consists of stories and articles from books and g</context>

The results should also be extended to investigate more fully the contributions of other types of syntactic relations of adjectives. Although it appears that verb-based disambiguation of adjectives can be formulated in the same way as noun-based disambiguation, we have not yet systematically studied the contribution of verbs. As in the case of nouns, we expect the appropriate representation to be in terms of semantic classes rather than sets of words (cf. Levin 1993). It would also be useful to address the possible contribution of adjectives other than the sense-specific antonyms. Finally, the results need to be extended beyond the class of adjectives. Most directly, nouns are probably as reliably disambiguated by adjectives as adjectives are by nouns. Appendix A: Extracting Word Sense Indicator Features This paper treats the disambiguation of adjectives relative to antonym-specific senses, with the nouns they modify as clues suggesting which sense pertains to a given instance. We model this situation more generally as follows. 22 John S. Justeson and Sla</context>

The utility and elegance of such semantic representations is suggested by linguistic discussions on lexical semantics. They have been used with notable success by Fillmore and Atkins (1991), who exploit the intricacies of such networks in a now-classic account of the semantics of risk, with different nodes of the network providing the locus of what might be distilled as the word&apos;s distinct senses. Similar network representations are adopted and implemented in restricted domains in several computational models (e.g., Sowa 1986). The semantics of noun senses therefore relate more specifically and directly to adjective senses than do nouns themselves; in fact, 38 (30%) of the 125 cases not covered by the rules of Table 2 are resolved when these broader semantic structures are used. In most of these cases, noun senses themselves supplied the attributes used by the rules of Table 2 to disambiguate adjectives. In other cases, such as role nouns, with more complex semantic structures, we are able to resolve the semantic relation of adjective and noun, but this ability cannot be captured in rules as simple as those of Tabl</context>
