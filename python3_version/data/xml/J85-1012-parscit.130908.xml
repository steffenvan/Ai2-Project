Guidelines for Submissions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99724075">
Manuscripts submitted to COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS should be typed on letter-size paper
(8.5 by 11 inches, or A4), double-spaced throughout, including footnotes and references. The paper
should begin with an informative abstract of approximately 150-250 words. Manuscripts must be
submitted in English.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.757083">
Submissions may be made in any of the following categories:
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.920338095238095">
PAPER: This category includes contributions that report significant new research results in computa-
tional linguistics or that provide critical reviews of the literature on a particular topic. The length of a
paper depends on its content, but we suggest that manuscripts be limited to forty double-spaced
pages. That is the equivalent of twelve journal pages. Each paper is fully refereed, being read by at
least two members of the editorial board and usually by an additional expert in the particular subject
area.
The submission of an article to CL for refereeing means that the author certifies the manuscript is
not copyrighted; nor has it been published or submitted for publication to another refereed journal. If
any version of the paper has appeared, or will appear, in a non-refereed publication. the details of
such publication must be made known to the Editor at the time of submission. The final version of a
paper tentatively accepted for publication must be accompanied by a Copyright Transfer Agreement
signed by all of the authors or, in the case of a &amp;quot;work for hire&amp;quot;, by the employer. This written trans-
fer is necessary under the 1978 U.S. Copyright law.
TECHNICAL CORRESPONDENCE: This category includes short articles reporting preliminary
results of some project in progress, or the results of other studies of interest to the readership. Techni-
cal correspondences should not generally exceed eight double-spaced pages. Each technical corre-
spondence is reviewed by at least two members of the editorial board before acceptance.
LETTERS TO THE EDITOR: This includes statements of opinion on issues relevant to the reader-
ship. The Editor and the editorial board will evaluate the appropriateness of these contributions for
inclusion.
Five copies of papers, technical correspondences, and letters should be sent to the Editor:

<abstract confidence="0.97988844">submitted to LINGUISTICS be typed on letter-size paper (8.5 by 11 inches, or A4), double-spaced throughout, including footnotes and references. The paper should begin with an informative abstract of approximately 150-250 words. Manuscripts must be submitted in English. Submissions may be made in any of the following categories: category includes contributions that report significant new research results in computational linguistics or that provide critical reviews of the literature on a particular topic. The length of a paper depends on its content, but we suggest that manuscripts be limited to forty double-spaced pages. That is the equivalent of twelve journal pages. Each paper is fully refereed, being read by at least two members of the editorial board and usually by an additional expert in the particular subject area. The submission of an article to CL for refereeing means that the author certifies the manuscript is not copyrighted; nor has it been published or submitted for publication to another refereed journal. If any version of the paper has appeared, or will appear, in a non-refereed publication. the details of such publication must be made known to the Editor at the time of submission. The final version of a paper tentatively accepted for publication must be accompanied by a Copyright Transfer Agreement signed by all of the authors or, in the case of a &amp;quot;work for hire&amp;quot;, by the employer. This written transfer is necessary under the 1978 U.S. Copyright law. CORRESPONDENCE: category includes short articles reporting preliminary results of some project in progress, or the results of other studies of interest to the readership. Technical correspondences should not generally exceed eight double-spaced pages. Each technical correspondence is reviewed by at least two members of the editorial board before acceptance. TO THE EDITOR: includes statements of opinion on issues relevant to the readership. The Editor and the editorial board will evaluate the appropriateness of these contributions for inclusion.</abstract>
