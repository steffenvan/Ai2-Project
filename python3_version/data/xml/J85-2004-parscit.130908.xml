This paper is an overview of ASCOF, a modular multilevel system for French-German translation. In
ASCOF, the classical divisions of the translation process (analysis, transfer, synthesis) have been
adopted.
The analysis is realized by three phases: (1) the morphological analysis, (2) the identification of
non-complex syntactic phrases and the macrostructure of the sentence, and (3) the determination of
the structure of complex syntactic phrases and the syntactic functions, in which syntactic and semantic
criteria are used. Semantic criteria are stored in a semantic network. The syntax-oriented parts of
the system interact with this semantic network during the identification of the syntactic functions. The
lexical transfer operates on the standardized output tree of the analysis. The structural transfer and
the syntactic synthesis are achieved by transformational grammars; the morphological synthesis, at
least, generates the word form of the target language (German).

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999349666666667">
ASCOF (Analysis and Synthesis of French by means of
COMSKEE) is a computer system for the processing of
natural language with the purpose of translating written
French texts into German texts. This system has been
under development since 1981 at the University of the
Saarland at Saarbriicken, West Germany (Project C of
SFB 100). At present (1984-1985), the research team,
which has drawn upon the experience and findings of
previous studies, consists of six members.
[SFB 100 is a research group in which different linguis-
tic and computer science-oriented projects cooperate.
The SFB 100 was founded in 1973 and is financed by the
DFG (German Research Foundation). Other projects of
the SFB 100 have been developing the programming
language COMSKEE and the systems SUSY and SUSY II.
ASCOF is an independent system especially conceived for
French and German. General descriptions of ASCOF are
given in Feneyrol, Ritzke, and Stegentritt (1984) and
Stegentritt (1983). Detailed descriptions of the various
problems and their solutions are discussed in Feneyrol
and Stegentritt (1982) and in Ritzke (1982)1

The system is programmed in COMSKEE (Computing
and String Keeping Language; cf. Mueller-von Brochow-
ski et al. (1981), Messerschmidt ( 1984) .) For the
computer scientist, COMSKEE is a procedural (imper-
ative) format-free, block-oriented programming language
such as ALGOL and Pascal, yet comprising some of the
qualities of functional languages (such as LISP or
PROLOG).
For the linguist, COMSKEE is a powerful device espe-
cially due to its dynamic data types — dictionary, set,
sentence, and string — and its dynamic operations — such
as positional and contextual substring access and assign-
ment.
The system runs on a SIEMENS 7561 under the system
BS 2000. ASCOF has been conceived as a completely
automatic translation system. As yet, we have been less
concerned with end-user application than with funda-
mental research. For this reason, we have focused
primarily upon linguistic and computer science problems,
rather than upon processing speed and the like.

<bodyText confidence="0.9996002">
In ASCOF the &amp;quot;classical&amp;quot; divisions (cf. Vauquois 1975)
have been adopted: analysis, transfer, and synthesis. The
result of the sentence analysis is represented as a stand-
ardized tree structure, which then serves as input for the
transfer and synthesis of the target language.

The ASCOF analysis takes place in three steps based on
different grammar and algorithm types. The morphologi-
cal analysis PHASE I is carried out by an algorithm that
realizes actually a mere pattern matching; in PHASE II
context-free grammars identify non-complex syntactic
phrases and the macrostructure of the sentence. A
reduction in the homographies of word classes is simul-
taneously achieved for the complete sentence. PHASE III
determines the syntactic functions within the sentence,
using syntactic and semantic criteria, and carries out the
semantic disambiguation of lexemes. This phase of anal-
ysis is performed by algorithms similar to ATN, repres-
enting an interactive system. [The term interactive system
might be problematic in this context as this term often
denotes components interacting with the user. Here we
are concerned with the process communication between
different components.] Consequently, the ASCOF analy-
sis does not constitute a one-pass parser but a system of
parsers (cf. Figure la). The strategy applied resembles
that of cascaded ATNs (Woods 1980) and was chosen
for the following reason: the complexity and length of
the sentences to be analyzed require — for reasons of
efficiency — parsing strategies appropriate to the different
problems, that is, context-free grammars for PHASE II,
which works exclusively with syntactic information, and
formalisms similar to ATN for PHASE III, where syntactic
and semantic information is combined. A similar combi-
nation of syntax and semantics often occurs in modern
parsers of various orientations, e.g., in the determinism
parser put forward by Marcus (1980, chap. 10).
This approach not only allows a step-by-step realiza-
tion of the test phases required for the development but
also provides the user with alternative options for the
output owing to the different depths of analysis in
PHASE II and III.

<bodyText confidence="0.99981747826087">
Beyond the phase of analysis, ASCOF includes a phase of
transfer and synthesis, where the words of the source
language are exchanged for those of the target language
and where simultaneously structures are altered in the
tree structure if necessary. The changes of structure are
carried out by a transformational grammar. The gram-
mar operates on trees; grammar and algorithm are sepa-
rate from each other and the algorithm interprets the
externally stored rules of the grammar. [The documenta-
tion of the transformational component is put forward by
Reding (1985); for the discussion of transformation
grammars in machine translation, cf. Vauquois (1975),
Boitet, Guillaume and Quezel-Ambrunaz (1982), and
Huckert (1979).]
On the leaves of the output tree, produced by the
syntactic synthesis, a further algorithm operates, which
interprets a set of morphological rules in order to gener-
ate the correct word forms of the target language. The
transfer and synthesis components of ASCOF are shown
in Figure lb.
The separation of grammar and algorithms allows the
application of the above-mentioned components in other
languages as well, provided that the grammar is replaced.

The most sophisticated phase within ASCOF concerns
analysis (French); the synthesizing phase (German) has
not yet been developed to such an elaborate extent.
This paper consequently concentrates on the
description of the analyzing phase. Much space is
devoted to segment analysis, the interaction of the
complement analysis and the analysis of complex noun
phrases, which is discussed in detail and illustrated by
examples.

PHASE I of the analysis consists of the sentence/text
input and the morphological analysis. Each word form is
assigned the set of possible categories as well as the
morpho-syntactic information. A full form and a stem
dictionary (both approximately 47,000 entries) as well as
a suffix dictionary (inflectional suffixes) are available.
Unknown word forms undergo a derivational analysis
(based on Stegentritt 1978).

Within ASCOF&apos;s PHASE II, we can distinguish two differ-
ent parts, both realized by means of context-free gram-
mars; in the first part, categorial (word class) ambiguities
are resolved through a CFG working on the string of
word classes issued from PHASE I. By applying this
grammar, we obtain one — or possibly more — string(s) of
unequivocal word classes. [A special word class problem
occurring in French, concerning the ambiguity of (-ant)
forms, is discussed in Feneyrol (1982).] As the consulted
grammar itself represents a rudimentary syntactic analy-
sis, here we arrive at an initial decomposition of the
sentence into so-called simple syntactic units, such as
nominal, prepositional, adjectival, adverbial, and verb
units; (coordinating and subordinating) conjunctions,
introducing words (relative pronouns and others), and
commas form proper units, too.

input for the second part of PHASE II, concerned with
the segmentation of the sentence, that is, its decompos-
ition into main and/or subordinate clause(s); the follow-
ing shows in more detail how this part of ASCOF works.
[Some of the problems appearing in the segmentation of
French sentences as well as a description of another type
of segmentation module used earlier are described in
Feneyrol (1983).]
The operation of segmentation itself takes place in two
steps, each of which is realized by a CFG; in the first
step, we apply the CFG IDENTIFICATION to the string
under (2) in order to &amp;quot;transform&amp;quot; the sequence of simple
syntactic units into so-called Segmentation Units (SU)
[we use the following conventions: &amp;quot;( )&amp;quot; for facultativi-
ty, &amp;quot;I &amp;quot; for alternatives, and &amp;quot;*&amp;quot; for repetition]:

It can be easily demonstrated that some other deriva-
tion attempts will not succeed; thus, for instance, if we
try to apply rule 2 of GROUPING in order to arrive at a
coordination of main clauses through the conjunction et,
the second presumed main clause will not be completable
since a verb phrase is missing (in contrast to a sequence
such as . . . et les pays africains (relative clause) souffri-
ront de la famine.). For another case of an ineffectual
attempt, we can note rule 11, which would initiate a
coordinate Sequence of Subordinate Clauses (SSBCL);
here this would lead to a missing verb phrase belonging
to the first SUNNOG of the sentence.
Each correct augmentation result — such as the one in
Figure 2 — forms the basis upon which the subsequent
PHASE III of ASCOF will then operate clause by clause.
[We are at present working on the combination of the
different distinct parts (word class disambiguation/
decomposition into simple syntactic units;
IDENTIFICATION and GROUPING); this conception will
ultimately lead to a single CFG achieving PHASE II of
ASCOF.]

The task of analyzing verb sequences, the first step of
PHASE III (cf. Figure 1a), is to group together isolated
verb elements (finite verbs, participle I, participle II,
infinitive) within a segment to assign a structural
description to these phrases (e.g., to determine VOICE
and TENSE) and — ultimately — to interpret those phrases
as nodes of a tree structure.
The grammar of the verbal analysis is conceived as a
two-step ATN (cf. Biewer 1985).
The transitions between the different states of the
ATN are guided primarily by a subclassification of verb
elements (e.g., participle II of avoir). The conception of
the ATN enables the processing of an unlimited number
of infinitive phrases; the integration of these infinitive
phrases into the tree structure is governed by categorial
information — recorded in dictionaries — as well as by
tests concerning the syntactic context. Nevertheless, the
interpretation of non-complex infinitive phrases as nodes
of a dependency tree does not exclude ambiguities that
cannot be resolved at this stage of the verbal analysis.
Accordingly, it is a set of hypothetical structures, gained
by purely syntactic and surface-related data, that forms
the output of the verbal analysis.

sentence is structured in such a way that parts of main
and subordinate clauses and their interrelations are iden-

sequences are determined. An interactive component

and prepositional phrases, and (3) the disambiguation of

lexical items, all according to syntactic and semantic
criteria.
In contrast to many other systems of machine trans-
lation or linguistic data processing, semantics and syntax
are here equally treated, neither having priority over the
other. Another characteristic feature is the interaction
between each step of analysis: the complement analysis
determines the head of a complement (SUB, K!, K2 in
Figure 3), and the internal structure of the complement
itself (hypotactic and paratactic relations) is determined
by the complex nominal analysis (NOMAL), the findings
of which are then returned to complement analysis (cf.
Figure 3). This interactive procedure is guided by the
syntactic-semantic features of the dominating verb. The
required syntactic features have already been calculated
in the previous analysis; in contrast, the semantic infor-
mation is memorized in the data base of the semantic
network and must be taken from there (cf. 4.4.4).
ASCOF analysis offers, as output, syntactic-functional
structure trees representing a synthesis of constituents
and dependencies.
In the complement analysis, the dictionary entries of
the verb — the verb being the central node of the
sentence — determine those noun or prepositional phrases
that belong to the verbal frame. The remaining phrases
are parts of complex noun or prepositional phrases or of
adverbials. For the preverbal and postverbal fields,
complement analysis operates separately, reflecting the
dissimilar structure of both fields. The component SUB,
operating in the preverbal field, defines subjects of non-
dominated verbs as well as possibly occurring pronominal
complements; dominated verbs (e.g., causative
constructions) are analyzed by another component, not
described in this paper (INFSUB, cf. Stegentritt (1982,
1984)). In the postverbal field, the components K1 and
K2 are activated for the complement analysis. In every
case, only the first constituent of the complement is
determined. Then the component NOMAL (cf. 4.4.3) is
called and investigates the structure of the identified
complement.
The component determining the subject (SUB) is
bipartite; in addition to the preverbal pronominal
complements, the first part also defines the subject,
provided that it is a pronominal subject. If there is no
pronominal subject, part two defines a nominal subject.
In the first part, the analysis progresses from right to left,
starting at the finite verb/auxiliary. All preverbial
elements are processed subsequently, until a pronominal
subject is found.
Figure 4 represents the first phase of SUB as an ATN.
The different paths correspond to the possible distrib-
utions of syntactic phrases in the preverbal field of the
French language. If the verb is directly preceded by a
comma, it is highly probable that this comma indicates
the end of an insertion, such as in sentence (4). In this
case, the analysis is continued up to the next comma,
with no consideration of the insertion. The edges and
states of the ATN that had been activated are listed in
(4a).

If the network comes to the end of a clause or meets a
configuration not covered by the rules, the second phase
of analysis — starting at the beginning of the clause in the
reverse direction of analysis — is called to search for the
first nominal phrase (i.e., the leftmost). This is, however,
a mere candidate for subject function, the form of a
syntactic phrase (NNOG) not yet indicating the actual
function of this phrase. As an illustration, compare (8).

conjunctions et or ou always indicate the end of a coordi-
nation. It follows that the subject candidate cannot be
the subject if the following structure is given:

examine a possibly complex internal structure of the

The complement analysis in the postverbal field is
carried out by another pair of components (K1 and K2),
also cooperating with NOMAL. K1 is the less sophisti-
cated complex, identifying nothing but direct comple-

phrases may assume, prepositional complements at this
stage are to be identified only if no more than one PG
within the segment is a potential candidate. Applied to
our example (1)
(1) la directive du Conseil du 20 juillet, qui, a l&apos;article 4,
prevoit une augmentation du prix du mais de 3%,
touche les regions du sud et les pays africains qui
dependent de ce produit d&apos;importation.
the results are:
— for prevoir une augmentation as a direct object
— for toucher: les regions as a direct object.
Again, the determination of the coordinative relationship
between regions and pays is given within NOMAL (cf.
4.4.3).
Yet, whenever the prepositional complement is
optional or when more than one candidate for an obliga-
tory prepositional complement is available, semantic
criteria must be observed in addition to formal and
syntactic criteria in order to correctly determine the
complements.
The semantic restrictions that must be respected when
a certain phrase is attributed the function of a comple-
ment are denoted in the verb entry in the dictionary.
According to these (semantic) restrictions, the algorithm
searches for the required criteria, namely among the
nuclear lexemes of the potential complement phrase
under consideration. The semantic information for these
lexemes, however, is not stored with their dictionary
entries (e.g., nouns) themselves, but is represented by a
semantic network (cf. 4.4.4).
The strategy used by ASCOF in K2 shall be illustrated
by the three verbs in sentence (1).
Prevoir does not demand the attribution of a further
complement, the verbal frame being saturated as soon as
une augmentation is identified as a direct complement.
The verb toucher raises other problems; toucher may
occur

ment: il m&apos;a touché du doigt.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999919285714286">
As to sentence (1), the direct complement les regions
having been located, it must still be examined whether
one of the following de-phrases is a complement; that is,
whether verbal frame (b) or (d) is valid. A de-phrase,
however, can for instance be the complement of toucher
if the noun of this phrase is semantically labeled as &amp;quot;part
of the body&amp;quot;. Consequently, the semantic value of the
nuclear lexemes of the de-phrase following les regions
must be examined in this respect. The results obtained
through consultation of the semantic network show that
the nuclear lexeme (sud) of this phrase does not satisfy
the required condition. It follows that verbal frame (b) is
actualized in this sentence. Simultaneously, this analysis
defines the reading of the verb.

As to the last verb of sentence (1), dependre, no direct
complement can be found. Thus the reading &apos;to be
dependent on&apos; versus the reading &apos;to take down&apos; is imme-
diately determined This reading of dependre demands an
obligatory de-valency. Yet no restrictions can be formu-
lated for the semantic quality of the nuclear lexeme of
the de-phrase. This implies that only formal and syntac-
tic criteria can be considered. In the case of the first
phase, de ce produit, the formal and syntactic criteria hold
true (a preposition introducing a phrase, an article) and
thus allow this phrase to be identified as a complement
and handed over as a head-phrase to the analysis of the
complex noun phrases. A second run of K2 checks the
following phrase, d&apos;importation, which is rejected by
those criteria identifying this phrase as a compound in
NOMAL. The criteria are: no proper noun, number =
singular, no article, no attribute. One single attribution is
performed accordingly.
An interesting variant of sentence (1) is:
(11) . . . dependent de l&apos;effet de l&apos;importation.
where both phrases may function as a complement. If
the second phrase (de l&apos;importation) is identified as a
complement, the first postverbal phrase can only be attri-
buted the function of an adverbial. In a concluding
control phase for those phrases scheduled as adverbials,
the structure variant of de l&apos;effet as an adverbial and de
l&apos;importation as a complement can be erased, effet not
being apt to assume the function of an adverbial in this
phrase, in contrast to prepositional phrases, such as de
cette maniere or de cette facon.

The task of the analysis of complex noun phrases (multi-
nuclear noun- and prepositional phrases) is to identify
their boundaries and to describe their internal structures,
i.e., to determine the syntactic-functional relations
between the various parts of the complex. [For more
details, cf. Ritzke (1985).]
The following syntactic-functional relations are
defined for the analysis:
— head-function of the central phrase of a complex (la
maison du pere)
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.982579133333333">
— paratactic relations of phrases depending on the head:
coordination (CO): the coordinated phrase has the
same syntactic function as the phrase with which it is
coordinated (l&apos; etude de la determination et de la classi-
fication).
apposition (AP): a paratactic relation on the level of
syntactic analysis (du froment tendre, plante comestible
qui . . . )
— hypotactic relations of phrases depending on the head:
prepositional complement/object (PO): signalizes a
very close relation between two phrases; the preposi-
tion of the second phrase is mostly synsemantic; the
PO and the inflectional case of the two languages
(French, German) frequently correspond to each
other (la voix de son maitre — die Stimme seines Herrn).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998759017241379">
[For more details concerning the function of prep-
ositions and their analysis, cf. Ritzke (1981).]
prepositional complement/part of a compound (PC):
implies an even closer unity of the two phrases; PC
and the governing phrase, in contrast to other struc-
tural units, represent primary units often functioning
as a one-nucleus phrase; this is of great importance to
the language pair French and German, the complex
phrase in French being equivalent to a German one-
word compound (e.g., la notation de base — Basisnota-
tion)
prepositional attribute (PA): signals a relatively free
relation to position and introductory preposition,
which is always autosemantic; for this reason, the PA
may assume many different semantic values (e.g.,
temporal or local attribute, etc.) un groupe simple a
l&apos;interieur du syntagme).
Basic elements for the analysis of complex noun
phrases are syntactic phrases having only one nucleus.
They may occur in the form of noun phrases, preposi-
tional phrases, or pronouns functioning as nouns.
Every one-nucleus noun — or prepositional — phrase of
these basis elements is directly relevant to the analysis of
complex noun phrases as a potential element of a
complex phrase. Every non-nominal phrase (e.g., verb
phrase, etc.) is indirectly relevant as an indicator of the
boundary of the complex.
As for French, the identification of the left boundary
of a complex noun phrase presents no problem since the
phrase furthest left of a complex is its central phrase (its
head) in the majority of cases. The head represents the
syntactic function of the whole complex on the sentence
level and at the same time marks the boundary of the left
side. Further phrases are located on the right side of the
head, the analysis being directed from left to right.
The head of a complex noun phrase is identified and
determined in syntax and function by means of the anal-
ysis of verb complements. The complement analysis
forms an interacting system with the analysis of nominal
complexes — as explained above. The potential head of a
potential complex noun phrase, identified by complement
analysis, is a signal for the call of the complex nominal
analysis.
The search for further phrases on the right side of the
head begins at the head. Here, two phrases are checked
to identify a boundary. These phrases consist of the
head on the left and a dependent phrase on the right
which is connected with this head. The syntactic func-
tion is simultaneously identified. Thereupon, comple-
ment analysis is called again to determine further
complements or non-complements, respectively.
Non-complements (adverbials) may also have a
complex internal structure. Accordingly, after the analy-
sis of complex-structured complements, non-comple-
ments are analyzed as to their possibly complex structure.
The preverbal field is investigated first. If, for example,
the complex structure of a subject has been identified
there, a further complex nominal analysis is undertaken

for the first phrase of the sentence — provided that this
phrase is identified as adverbial and that other phrases
follow in the field between its position and the head of
the subject. This is done in order to clarify whether this
phrase is a central phrase of an adverbial complex.
A similar approach is applied for the postverbal field:
first the complements, then the non-complements, are
analyzed as to their possibly complex internal structures.
In principle every phrase can be related to another
phrase in its direct neighborhood. This phrase again may
dominate a subsequent phrase, etc., so that highly recur-
sive structures may appear within a nominal complex
(right-branches cascades).
At the same time two related phrases may be discon-
nected by other phrases, when several phrases of differ-
ent syntactical relations are dependent upon the same
phrases. In addition to the potentially recursive struc-
tures, discontinuous relations must be detected as well.
The algorithm NOMAL has been conceived especially
for the solution of those recursions and discontinuities
within the complex nominal syntax (cf. Figure 5).
NOMAL is a procedural (sub)system similar to an
ATN. Each syntactic function has its own procedure.
The procedures are called successively by the main
program whenever a pair of phrases — the head and the
actual phrase — is examined. The identification of the
relation that is — or is not — established between both
phrases is governed by rules containing conditions for the
head and the actual phrase. Each procedure is provided
by a proper set of rules; the monitoring of the rule condi-
tions is carried out by test operations on edges.
If the testing of a rule attains a positive result — that is,
if the conditions in this rule for head and actual phrase
hold true — the phrases are unified and their relation
interpreted according to the procedure where the rule
was found. Valid conditions in the procedure PO, for
example, have the effect that the relation between the
phrases is identified as a prepositional comple-
ment/object. The approach is analogous for the remain-
ing procedures.

The actual phrase having thus been attributed a func-
tion, it becomes the head itself in the next run; the actual
phrase will then be the subsequent phrase. Analogously,
further positive results gradually move the actual phrase
to the head of the next run; the head is deferred to the
right, thus allowing the correct analysis of recursive
cascades.
If none of the procedures attains a positive result, the
new run is begun with another head, that is, with the
phrase to the left of the head last tested. If there is still
no positive result, the head keeps moving analogously to
the left, until all the possibilities have been tried. The
actual phrase is identical for all runs, thus allowing the
analysis of relations between two discontinuous phrases.
In every case, a boundary is reached when none of the
runs offers a positive result. The former actual phrase
then no longer belongs to the complex but rather indi-
cates its boundary.
The conditions denoted in the rules consist of
morpho-syntactic and semantic information. Morpho-
syntactic information (e.g., an article, the form of an
introductory preposition) can be read directly, the previ-
ous step of the analysis having made it available. In
contrast, the semantic information must be deduced from
the semantic network, which serves as a data base for the
syntactic-functional analysis (cf. 4.4.4).
The importance that evaluating rule conditions holds
for the analysis shall be demonstrated in the following by
the complex noun phrases in example (1).
The nominal complex Les regions du sud et les pays
africains:
Formal indicators can be checked at this point for the
determination of the paratactic relation: in our exam-
ple, the coordinating conjunction et. Commas and the
sequences of comma and conjunction may be evalu-
ated as well. Yet the mere checking of such indicators
is generally not sufficient for determining the proper
parts of a coordination.
In order to determine the correct parts, the seman-
tics of the nouns must also be checked, that is, the
closeness of the semantic relation between the candi-
dates in question must be checked in the example.
This is accomplished by retrieving operations within
the semantic network using the nominal lexemes of the
different phrases. The common generic term
(geographic place), which is reached by region and
pays, satisfy the two conditions: coordination indicator
et and greatest semantic closeness. They are parts of
the coordination, the phrase du sud is recognized to be
a prepositional complement/object of the first phrase
by the procedure PO. The result is the following
structure:
((les regions (du sud)(P0)) (les pay africains)(C0))
The nominal complex la directive du Conseil du 20 juillet:
For hypotactic relations, too, the examination of
semantic criteria is necessary over and above that of
the syntactic conditions. The search for a certain
preposition at the beginning of a clause — in our exam-
pie, de as an indicator of object references — must be
performed by examining the semantic closeness of the
nuclei (nouns) of the phrases. In the given example,
the direct time indication, which suggests an attribu-
tive relation, is thus identified. In the network, a
temporal attribution is closer to the information of &apos;act
of legislation&apos; (connected with the lexeme directive)
than to &apos;institution&apos; (connected with the actual reading
of the lexeme Conseil). Accordingly, valid conditions
exist for the relation of prepositional
complement/object between la directive and du
Conseil and for the relation prepositional attribute
between la directive and du 20 juillet. The last relation
is discontinuous. The result of the analysis is the
following structure:
((la directive (du Conseil)(P0))(du 20 juillet)(PA))
The nominal complex une augmentation du prix du mars
de 3%:
The last non-complex phrase, de 3%, of this complex
phrase holds a — likewise discontinuous — relation to
the first phrase, une augmentation, whereas the
remaining de-phrases form a cascade and each
depends upon its preceding phrase (the relation of
prepositional complement/object).
The phrase de 3%, an indication of quantity, is
more closely related to the action, augmentation
(action/state of affairs: increase), by the correspond-
ing edge configuration in the network than to prix
(notion of a measure) or to mars (plant, agricultural
product). Accordingly, a relation is established
between de 3% and une augmentation, disregarding
the interposed phrases. The result is the following
structure:
((une augmentation((du prix (du mais)(P0))(P0))
(de 3%)(PA)))
The nominal complex de ce produit d&apos;importation:
In order to determine the relation between the two
phrases, formal criteria may be more readily applied
than in the previous cases. The second phrase is char-
acterized by the fact that neither a determinative nor
an attributive element is contained or follows. More-
over, the nominal nucleus neither is in the plural nor is
it a proper name. The phrase is introduced by the
preposition de. All the characteristics are rule condi-
tions for an actual phrase in the procedure preposi-
tional complement/part of a compound. These
conditions being fulfilled and no other candidate being
present, the relation between the phrases may be
determined in this particular case without semantic
examinations. The result is the bracketing:
(de ce produit (d&apos;importation)(PC))
As it is difficult in many cases, mainly in the postver-
bal field, to determine a function with certainty after a
single run of the analysis of complex noun phrases, deci-
sions are made only if there is no doubt (e.g., if there is

only one potential candidate or if candidates can be
excluded because of semantic incompatibility, etc.).
Otherwise a solution must be sought through repeated
interaction with its complement analysis, which must
then be given priority. Yet, given the basic alternative of
the PP-attachment (complement, adverbial, part of a
complex noun phrase), a reliable solution cannot always
be found and several solutions may be admitted in such
doubtful cases.

Conceding that structural descriptions within machine
translation — functioning as the input for a transferring
component and thus defining a sort of &amp;quot;interlingua&amp;quot; —
cannot be established without semantic information, the
appropriate form for representing this information as well
as its integration into the analysis process appears to be
controversial.
With regard to the various ways of integrating seman-
tic information, and above all to the proper moment of its
integration, there are two extremely different points of
view. On the one hand, syntax may be accorded absolute
priority, in such a way that all syntactic and structural
descriptions of a given input sentence are generated and
only then semantically interpreted and filtered according
to the semantic information. On the other hand, the
analyzing algorithm can be guided by semantic informa-
tion, the &amp;quot;level&amp;quot; of syntactic relations only being
consulted as a secondary control mechanism.
Most machine translation systems favor the first point
of view, partly owing to the history of this science. Yet
then, of course, the problem with highly complex
sentences is how to deal with syntactic ambiguities. If,
for example, an input sentence is attributed a number of
tree structure by the syntax-driven analysis, part of the
syntactic relations will necessarily be represented redun-
dantly; if, on the other hand, the input sentence is attri-
buted a chart or chart-like structural description by the
syntactic analysis, much more time must be sacrificed to
the semantic component — as a consequence of the more
complex input structure.
Semantically driven parsers, whose equivalents can
mainly be found in language-oriented Al research, guar-
antee a highly efficient parsing, but are extremely
dependent upon their discourse area, due to their consid-
erably limited &amp;quot;expectancy&amp;quot;, and generally operate on
non-complex sentences, linguistically speaking.
In order to isolate correct structural descriptions as
soon as possible, cross-connections between syntax and
semantics are established by the ASCOF system (cf.
4.4.2). This is to say that semantic information is made
available for the identification of syntactic-functional
relations and that, vice versa, syntactic and functional
relations can be used for semantic interpretation (disam-
biguation).
The flow of information between syntax and semantic
in ASCOF analysis is therefore not based on a phase
model (e.g., the sequential operations of separate
modules). The semantic information in the ASCOF
system is stored in a semantic network. (For different
conceptions of semantic networks, cf., above all, Findler
(1979).)
The implementation of the network structure is based
on the COMSKEE data structure &amp;quot;dictionary&amp;quot;, which is a
string-indexed array (of variable length) over strings (of
variable length) that can be held externally. &amp;quot;Of variable
length&amp;quot; means that a string can be of any size so that its
length is only limited by the memory space of the
machine.

All directly addressable nodes in the network repre-
sent basic forms that point to semantically unambiguous
readings following denoting edges. Consequently, they
represent the FORM-CONTENT relation. For example,
the basic lexical form cuisiniere points in the semantic
readings of &apos;female cook&apos; and &apos;oven&apos;, following the
denoting edges, as Figure 8 shows:
As also shown in Figure 8, several basic lexical forms
may refer to the same semantic reading when following
the denoting edges. The relation defined by denoting
edges thus takes into account the linguistic phenomena of
synonymy and polysemy.
ISA edges, which define a special implicit relation, are
important for two reasons. First, they allow the defining
of a sort of semantic distance between linguistic units,
and second, they economically administer information
deducible by inheritance paths.
Semantic distance in the linguistic sense may be of
importance for the correct identification of coordinative
structures. The complex noun phrase in

may — on a purely syntactic level — be attributed two
structures (des can be interpreted as a preposition as well
as an indefinite article), cf. Figures 9a and 9b:
Based on the information as illustrated in Figure 8, it
is now possible to carry out a lexeme disambiguation of
cuisiniere (namely, as (cuisiniere 2)) as well as to give
structure 9a priority over structure 9b, since
(cuisiniere 2) is semantically more closely related to
re frigerateur than (cuisiniere 1) and, furthermore, since
(cuisiniere 1) and (cuisiniere 2) are more closely
related to the node `refrigerateue than to `vente&apos;.
Because of the relations expressed in Figure 8, structure
9c can be assigned to sentence 12:
As made clear by this example, syntactic-functional
and semantic decisions are made almost simultaneously
in ASCOF. A system admitting a two-phase model for
the informational flow between syntax and semantics
would not only have to organize the ambiguity of struc-
tures in sentence (12) but — in order to undertake a
lexeme disambiguation of cuisiniere — would also have to
construct exactly those syntactic relations directly avail-
able in an interactive system like ASCOF
For lexeme disambiguation as well as for the identifi-
cation of syntactic-functional relations, linguistics units
that may function as predicates are of major importance.
These are primarily adjectives and verbs. Each &amp;quot;verbal
node&amp;quot; following denoting edges refers to a set of verbal
frames whose complement slots are described by syntac-
tic and semantic conditions.
In detail, each complement slot is attributed the
following information.

In the following, the procedure and the efficiency of
the semantic network within the syntactic-functional

tative example.
The French verb fumer, for instance, is assigned three
verbal frames; they correspond to the readings of &apos;to
smoke a cigarette, to give off smoke, to smoke a trout&apos;,
cf. Figure 10.
As in Figure 10, a network relation between entity
nodes and predicate nodes is established according to
semantic conditions defining the restrictions for the
different complement slots. In Figure 10, this allows the
interpretation of fumer as &apos;to give off smoke&apos; and the
rejection of the other interpretations (cf. the action
commands within verbal frames). This is to say that
once cheminee is identified as a subject, there is no need
to look for a direct object. Furthermore, Figure 10
demonstrates that &amp;quot;semantic markers&amp;quot; alone do not guar-
antee correct semantic interpretations. It is by no means

In a componential model, every animal would have to be
marked /can be smoked (dried)/, whereas in the
network model this information may be deduced by
following a &amp;quot;function&amp;quot; arc from &apos;animal&apos; to `viande&apos;.
Moreover, with the complement identification, semantic
conditions attributed to the different complement slots
may be considered for lexeme disambiguation. For
example, the reading &apos;oven&apos; for the noun cuisiniere in
(13) and (14) can be rejected on grounds of the semantic
conditions attributed to the subject slots.
At the end of this part of the analysis, the syntactic-
functional structure of the sentence is produced (i.e.,
main and sub-/coordinate clauses, the verb predicate and
its complements, adverbials, as well as the internal struc-
ture of noun and prepositional phrases are identified).
The analysis yields no interlingual structures but rather
structures more closely related to the source language.
These are represented by canonical trees. At the same
time, due to the interaction between syntax and seman-
tics, many of the lexical ambiguities are resolved. Before
starting ASCOF&apos;s final two phases of transfer and synthe-
sis, any remaining ambiguities must be cleared up espe-
cially by means of further semantic information.

The phases of the system subsequent to the analysis
include a transformation component (transfer and
syntactic synthesis) and a morphological synthesis. In
the transfer phase, the source language lemmata are first
replaced by their target language equivalents. Here it is
not sufficient to merely exchange lexemes since target
language differences of a lexical nature arising from
syntax and/or semantics need to be borne in mind.
Instead, the replacement process must take into consider-
ation the information contained in the analysis tree, for
example, the syntactic and semantic verb frame actuali-
zation. Subsequent to the lexical transfer, the analysis
structures are transferred to the structures appropriate to
the target language (syntactic synthesis). This transfer
component is implemented as a tree transformation algo-
rithm that interprets externally stored rules (transforma-
tion instructions). Linguistic data and algorithm are thus
strictly separated from one another so that this compo-
nent may also be used for other language pairs. The
transformation algorithm runs through the analysis tree
in preorder, tests for each node whether a package of
rules exists for the given node label and — provided that
the conditions of a rule are fulfilled — carries out the
instructions that refer to some few elementary oper-
ations. The conditions and the transformation
instructions can refer to both subtrees and the attribute-
value pairs associated with the node. (For example, the
inheritance of the target language gender of the head of a
NOG to attribute and determiner complex.)

The input for the morphological synthesis is the labeled
tree taken from the syntactic synthesis. In contrast to the
syntactic synthesis, the morphological synthesis operates
only locally, in other words, the pre-terminal nodes are
examined and processed isolated from each other. Tree
transformations are thus no longer carried out. The basic
forms of the lexemes and the morpho-syntactic informa-
tion from the pre-terminal nodes serve as keys that call
the appropriate rule of the morphological generative
grammar. Grammar and algorithm are separate. The
grammar for the morphological synthesis of German is
able to generate German word forms, provided that the
necessary information supplied from all of the preceding
phases is complete and accurate.

The ASCOF system has been implemented in the sections
described in the present paper and has in part already
been tested. Here we have a version that covers syntac-
tic structures and vocabulary based on texts (EC bulle-
tins) taken from the agricultural sphere. The vocabulary
of this sphere is completely covered on the morpho-syn-
tactic level. As yet, owing to the complexity of the
semantics, the semantic data bases (semantic network)
has been developed only as a prototype. The improve-
ment of .the quality of the translations performed by
ASCOF is basically dependent upon the development and
elaboration of the semantic networks.

<abstract confidence="0.986194870588235">This paper is an overview of ASCOF, a modular multilevel system for French-German translation. In ASCOF, the classical divisions of the translation process (analysis, transfer, synthesis) have been adopted. The analysis is realized by three phases: (1) the morphological analysis, (2) the identification of non-complex syntactic phrases and the macrostructure of the sentence, and (3) the determination of the structure of complex syntactic phrases and the syntactic functions, in which syntactic and semantic criteria are used. Semantic criteria are stored in a semantic network. The syntax-oriented parts of the system interact with this semantic network during the identification of the syntactic functions. The lexical transfer operates on the standardized output tree of the analysis. The structural transfer and the syntactic synthesis are achieved by transformational grammars; the morphological synthesis, at least, generates the word form of the target language (German). 1 PROJECT HISTORY AND STATUS ASCOF (Analysis and Synthesis of French by means of COMSKEE) is a computer system for the processing of natural language with the purpose of translating written French texts into German texts. This system has been under development since 1981 at the University of the Saarland at Saarbriicken, West Germany (Project C of SFB 100). At present (1984-1985), the research team, which has drawn upon the experience and findings of previous studies, consists of six members. [SFB 100 is a research group in which different linguistic and computer science-oriented projects cooperate. The SFB 100 was founded in 1973 and is financed by the DFG (German Research Foundation). Other projects of the SFB 100 have been developing the programming language COMSKEE and the systems SUSY and SUSY II. ASCOF is an independent system especially conceived for French and German. General descriptions of ASCOF are given in Feneyrol, Ritzke, and Stegentritt (1984) and Stegentritt (1983). Detailed descriptions of the various problems and their solutions are discussed in Feneyrol and Stegentritt (1982) and in Ritzke (1982)1 2 APPLICATION ENVIRONMENT system is programmed in and String Keeping Language; cf. Mueller-von Brochowski et al. (1981), Messerschmidt ( 1984) .) For the computer scientist, COMSKEE is a procedural (imperative) format-free, block-oriented programming language such as ALGOL and Pascal, yet comprising some of the qualities of functional languages (such as LISP or PROLOG). For the linguist, COMSKEE is a powerful device especially due to its dynamic data types — dictionary, set, sentence, and string — and its dynamic operations — such as positional and contextual substring access and assignment. system runs on a 7561 the system ASCOF been conceived as a completely automatic translation system. As yet, we have been less concerned with end-user application than with fundamental research. For this reason, we have focused primarily upon linguistic and computer science problems, rather than upon processing speed and the like. the Association for Computational Linguistics.

Vauquois 1975) have been adopted: analysis, transfer, and synthesis. The result of the sentence analysis is represented as a standardized tree structure, which then serves as input for the transfer and synthesis of the target language. 3.2 The ASCOF analysis takes place in three steps based on different grammar and algorithm types. The morphological analysis PHASE I is carried out by an algorithm that realizes actually a mere pattern matching; in PHASE II context-free grammars identify non-complex syntactic phrases and the macrostructure of the sentence. A reduction in the homographies of word classes is simulachieved for the complete sentence. PHASE determines the syntactic functions within the sentence, using syntactic and semantic criteria, and carries out the semantic disambiguation of lexemes. This phase of analysis is performed by algorithms similar to ATN, represan interactive system. [The term system might be problematic in this context as this term often denotes components interacting with the user. Here we are concerned with the process communication between different components.] Consequently, the ASCOF analysis does not constitute a one-pass parser but a system of (cf. la). strategy applied resembles that of cascaded ATNs (Woods 1980) and was chosen for the following reason: the complexity and length of the sentences to be analyzed require — for reasons of efficiency — parsing strategies appropriate to the different that is, context-free grammars for which works exclusively with syntactic information, and similar to ATN for PHASE syntactic and semantic information is combined. A similar combination of syntax and semantics often occurs in modern parsers of various orientations, e.g., in the determinism parser put forward by Marcus (1980, chap. 10). This approach not only allows a step-by-step realization of the test phases required for the development but also provides the user with alternative options for the output owing to the different depths of analysis in II and 3.3 Beyond the phase of analysis, ASCOF includes a phase of transfer and synthesis, where the words of the source language are exchanged for those of the target language and where simultaneously structures are altered in the tree structure if necessary. The changes of structure are carried out by a transformational grammar. The grammar operates on trees; grammar and algorithm are separate from each other and the algorithm interprets the externally stored rules of the grammar. [The documentation of the transformational component is put forward by Reding (1985); for the discussion of transformation grammars in machine translation, cf. Vauquois (1975), Boitet, Guillaume and Quezel-Ambrunaz (1982), and Huckert (1979).] On the leaves of the output tree, produced by the syntactic synthesis, a further algorithm operates, which interprets a set of morphological rules in order to generate the correct word forms of the target language. The transfer and synthesis components of ASCOF are shown lb. The separation of grammar and algorithms allows the application of the above-mentioned components in other languages as well, provided that the grammar is replaced. LINGUISTIC TECHNIQUES COMPUTATIONAL REALIZATION 4.1 The most sophisticated phase within ASCOF concerns analysis (French); the synthesizing phase (German) has not yet been developed to such an elaborate extent. This paper consequently concentrates on the description of the analyzing phase. Much space is devoted to segment analysis, the interaction of the complement analysis and the analysis of complex noun phrases, which is discussed in detail and illustrated by examples. 4.2 PHASE I of the analysis consists of the sentence/text input and the morphological analysis. Each word form is assigned the set of possible categories as well as the information. form and a stem dictionary (both approximately 47,000 entries) as well as a suffix dictionary (inflectional suffixes) are available. Unknown word forms undergo a derivational analysis (based on Stegentritt 1978). 4.3 Within ASCOF&apos;s PHASE II, we can distinguish two different parts, both realized by means of context-free grammars; in the first part, categorial (word class) ambiguities are resolved through a CFG working on the string of word classes issued from PHASE I. By applying this grammar, we obtain one — or possibly more — string(s) of unequivocal word classes. [A special word class problem occurring in French, concerning the ambiguity of (-ant) forms, is discussed in Feneyrol (1982).] As the consulted grammar itself represents a rudimentary syntactic analysis, here we arrive at an initial decomposition of the sentence into so-called simple syntactic units, such as nominal, prepositional, adjectival, adverbial, and verb units; (coordinating and subordinating) conjunctions, introducing words (relative pronouns and others), and commas form proper units, too. For a sentence such as (1) la directive du Conseil du 20 juillet, qui, A Particle 4, prevoit une augmentation du prix du mais de 3%, touche les regions du sud et les pays africains qui dependent de ce produit d&apos;importation.</abstract>

Computational Linguistics, Volume II, Numbers 2-3, April-September 1985 It can be easily demonstrated that some other derivation attempts will not succeed; thus, for instance, if we to apply rule 2 of order to arrive at a of main clauses through the conjunction the second presumed main clause will not be completable since a verb phrase is missing (in contrast to a sequence as . . . les pays africains clause) souffride la famine.). another case of an ineffectual attempt, we can note rule 11, which would initiate a coordinate Sequence of Subordinate Clauses (SSBCL); here this would lead to a missing verb phrase belonging the first the sentence. Each correct augmentation result — such as the one in Figure 2 — forms the basis upon which the subsequent ASCOF will then operate clause by clause. [We are at present working on the combination of the different distinct parts (word class disambiguation/ decomposition into simple syntactic GROUPING); this conception will lead to a single CFG achieving II of ASCOF.] 4.4 4.4.1 The task of analyzing verb sequences, the first step of PHASE III (cf. Figure 1a), is to group together isolated verb elements (finite verbs, participle I, participle II, infinitive) within a segment to assign a structural to these phrases (e.g., to determine — ultimately — to interpret those phrases as nodes of a tree structure.

The transitions between the different states of the guided primarily by a subclassification of verb (e.g., participle II of conception of the ATN enables the processing of an unlimited number of infinitive phrases; the integration of these infinitive phrases into the tree structure is governed by categorial information — recorded in dictionaries — as well as by tests concerning the syntactic context. Nevertheless, the interpretation of non-complex infinitive phrases as nodes of a dependency tree does not exclude ambiguities that cannot be resolved at this stage of the verbal analysis. Accordingly, it is a set of hypothetical structures, gained by purely syntactic and surface-related data, that forms the output of the verbal analysis. 4.4.2 When the analysis of verb phrases is completed, the sentence is structured in such a way that parts of main and subordinate clauses and their interrelations are identified. Furthermore, non-complex syntactic (one-nuclear) noun and prepositional phrases as well as verb sequences are determined.

In contrast to many other systems of machine translation or linguistic data processing, semantics and syntax are here equally treated, neither having priority over the other. Another characteristic feature is the interaction between each step of analysis: the complement analysis determines the head of a complement (SUB, K!, K2 in Figure 3), and the internal structure of the complement itself (hypotactic and paratactic relations) is determined by the complex nominal analysis (NOMAL), the findings of which are then returned to complement analysis (cf. Figure 3). This interactive procedure is guided by the syntactic-semantic features of the dominating verb. The required syntactic features have already been calculated in the previous analysis; in contrast, the semantic information is memorized in the data base of the semantic network and must be taken from there (cf. 4.4.4). offers, as output, syntactic-functional structure trees representing a synthesis of constituents and dependencies. In the complement analysis, the dictionary entries of the verb — the verb being the central node of the sentence — determine those noun or prepositional phrases that belong to the verbal frame. The remaining phrases are parts of complex noun or prepositional phrases or of adverbials. For the preverbal and postverbal fields, complement analysis operates separately, reflecting the dissimilar structure of both fields. The component SUB, operating in the preverbal field, defines subjects of nondominated verbs as well as possibly occurring pronominal complements; dominated verbs (e.g., causative constructions) are analyzed by another component, not described in this paper (INFSUB, cf. Stegentritt (1982, 1984)). In the postverbal field, the components K1 and K2 are activated for the complement analysis. In every case, only the first constituent of the complement is Then the component 4.4.3) is called and investigates the structure of the identified complement. The component determining the subject (SUB) is bipartite; in addition to the preverbal pronominal complements, the first part also defines the subject, provided that it is a pronominal subject. If there is no pronominal subject, part two defines a nominal subject. In the first part, the analysis progresses from right to left, starting at the finite verb/auxiliary. All elements are processed subsequently, until a pronominal subject is found. the first phase of SUB as an ATN. The different paths correspond to the possible distributions of syntactic phrases in the preverbal field of the French language. If the verb is directly preceded by a comma, it is highly probable that this comma indicates the end of an insertion, such as in sentence (4). In this case, the analysis is continued up to the next comma, with no consideration of the insertion. The edges and states of the ATN that had been activated are listed in (4a).

This is, however, a mere candidate for subject function, the form of a syntactic phrase (NNOG) not yet indicating the actual function of this phrase. As an illustration, compare (8). (8) Apres les changements de cours pour le froment, la seigle, la directive ( . . . ) touche ( . . . ) As the set of rules in this second phase supplies the first phrase (NNOG, = (8)) as a subject, the phrase in question must be checked as to whether or not it is part of a coordination of prepositional phrases in which the preposition can be deleted. This subject-control mechanism presupposes that the coordinating indicate the end of a coordination. It follows that the subject candidate cannot be the subject if the following structure is given: (9) CANDIDATE-COORD-NNOG-COMMA-NNOG-VERB In this structure, however, the final preverbal NNOG (in directive) the correct subject. In structure (10): (10) CANDIDATE-COORD-NNOG-VERB the subject candidate is confirmed. The head of the subject having been identified, phase NOMAL is called to examine a possibly complex internal structure of the subject and further potentially complex nominal sentence elements in the preverbal field — as, for example, the insertion Particle in sentence (4) (cf. 4.4.3). The complement analysis in the postverbal field is carried out by another pair of components (K1 and K2), also cooperating with NOMAL. K1 is the less sophisticated complex, identifying nothing but direct complements — which it recognizes merely by form — and prepositional complements obligatorily demanded by the verb. Yet because of the various functions prepositional Computational Linguistics, Volume 11, Numbers 2-3, April-September 1985 phrases may assume, prepositional complements at this stage are to be identified only if no more than one PG within the segment is a potential candidate. Applied to our example (1) (1) la directive du Conseil du 20 juillet, qui, a l&apos;article 4, prevoit une augmentation du prix du mais de 3%, touche les regions du sud et les pays africains qui dependent de ce produit d&apos;importation. the results are: for une augmentation a direct object for les regions a direct object. Again, the determination of the coordinative relationship given within NOMAL (cf. 4.4.3). Yet, whenever the prepositional complement is optional or when more than one candidate for an obligatory prepositional complement is available, semantic must be observed addition formal and syntactic criteria in order to correctly determine the complements. The semantic restrictions that must be respected when a certain phrase is attributed the function of a complement are denoted in the verb entry in the dictionary. According to these (semantic) restrictions, the algorithm searches for the required criteria, namely among the nuclear lexemes of the potential complement phrase under consideration. The semantic information for these lexemes, however, is not stored with their dictionary entries (e.g., nouns) themselves, but is represented by a semantic network (cf. 4.4.4). The strategy used by ASCOF in K2 shall be illustrated by the three verbs in sentence (1). not demand the attribution of a further complement, the verbal frame being saturated as soon as augmentation identified as a direct complement. verb other problems; occur without any complement: tireur d&apos;elite a touché. with a direct complement: touche ma main. with an a-complement: chercheur touche au but. with a direct complement and an optional complem&apos;a touché du doigt. to sentence (1), the direct complement regions having been located, it must still be examined whether one of the following de-phrases is a complement; that is, whether verbal frame (b) or (d) is valid. A de-phrase, can for instance be the complement of if the noun of this phrase is semantically labeled as &amp;quot;part of the body&amp;quot;. Consequently, the semantic value of the lexemes of the de-phrase following regions must be examined in this respect. The results obtained through consultation of the semantic network show that nuclear lexeme this phrase does not satisfy the required condition. It follows that verbal frame (b) is actualized in this sentence. Simultaneously, this analysis defines the reading of the verb. 145 Axel Biewer, Christian Feneyrol, Johannes Ritzke, Erwin Stegentritt ASCOF to the last verb of sentence (1), direct complement can be found. Thus the reading &apos;to be dependent on&apos; versus the reading &apos;to take down&apos; is immedetermined This reading of an obligatory de-valency. Yet no restrictions can be formulated for the semantic quality of the nuclear lexeme of the de-phrase. This implies that only formal and syntactic criteria can be considered. In the case of the first ce produit, formal and syntactic criteria hold true (a preposition introducing a phrase, an article) and thus allow this phrase to be identified as a complement and handed over as a head-phrase to the analysis of the noun phrases. A second run of the phrase, is rejected by those criteria identifying this phrase as a compound in criteria are: no proper noun, number = singular, no article, no attribute. One single attribution is performed accordingly. An interesting variant of sentence (1) is: (11) . . . dependent de l&apos;effet de l&apos;importation. where both phrases may function as a complement. If second phrase l&apos;importation) identified as a complement, the first postverbal phrase can only be attributed the function of an adverbial. In a concluding control phase for those phrases scheduled as adverbials, structure variant of l&apos;effet an adverbial and a complement can be erased, being apt to assume the function of an adverbial in this in contrast to prepositional phrases, such as maniere cette facon. 4.4.3 The task of the analysis of complex noun phrases (multinuclear nounand prepositional phrases) is to identify their boundaries and to describe their internal structures, i.e., to determine the syntactic-functional relations between the various parts of the complex. [For more details, cf. Ritzke (1985).] The following syntactic-functional relations are defined for the analysis: head-function of the central phrase of a complex maison du pere) — paratactic relations of phrases depending on the head: the coordinated phrase has the same syntactic function as the phrase with which it is etude de la determination et de la classification). a paratactic relation the level of analysis froment tendre, plante comestible qui . . . ) — hypotactic relations of phrases depending on the head: complement/object signalizes a close between two phrases; the preposition of the second phrase is mostly synsemantic; the and the case of the two languages (French, German) frequently correspond to each voix de son maitre Stimme seines Herrn). [For more details concerning the function of prepositions and their analysis, cf. Ritzke (1981).] complement/part of a compound implies an even closer unity of the two phrases; PC and the governing phrase, in contrast to other structural units, represent primary units often functioning as a one-nucleus phrase; this is of great importance to the language pair French and German, the complex phrase in French being equivalent to a German onecompound (e.g., notation de base — Basisnotation) attribute signals a free relation to position and introductory preposition, is always autosemantic; for this reason, the assume different semantic values (e.g., or local attribute, etc.) groupe simple l&apos;interieur du syntagme). Basic elements for the analysis of complex noun phrases are syntactic phrases having only one nucleus. They may occur in the form of noun phrases, prepositional phrases, or pronouns functioning as nouns. Every one-nucleus noun — or prepositional — phrase of these basis elements is directly relevant to the analysis of complex noun phrases as a potential element of a complex phrase. Every non-nominal phrase (e.g., verb phrase, etc.) is indirectly relevant as an indicator of the boundary of the complex. As for French, the identification of the left boundary of a complex noun phrase presents no problem since the phrase furthest left of a complex is its central phrase (its head) in the majority of cases. The head represents the syntactic function of the whole complex on the sentence and at the same time marks the boundary of the side. Further phrases are located on the right side of the head, the analysis being directed from left to right. The head of a complex noun phrase is identified and determined in syntax and function by means of the analysis of verb complements. The complement analysis forms an interacting system with the analysis of nominal complexes — as explained above. The potential head of a potential complex noun phrase, identified by complement analysis, is a signal for the call of the complex nominal analysis. The search for further phrases on the right side of the head begins at the head. Here, two phrases are checked to identify a boundary. These phrases consist of the head on the left and a dependent phrase on the right which is connected with this head. The syntactic function is simultaneously identified. Thereupon, complement analysis is called again to determine further complements or non-complements, respectively. Non-complements (adverbials) may also have a complex internal structure. Accordingly, after the analysis of complex-structured complements, non-complements are analyzed as to their possibly complex structure. The preverbal field is investigated first. If, for example, the complex structure of a subject has been identified there, a further complex nominal analysis is undertaken Linguistics, Volume 11, Numbers 2-3, April-September 1985 Axel Biewer, Christian Feneyrol, Johannes Ritzke, Erwin Stegentritt ASCOF for the first phrase of the sentence — provided that this phrase is identified as adverbial and that other phrases follow in the field between its position and the head of the subject. This is done in order to clarify whether this phrase is a central phrase of an adverbial complex. A similar approach is applied for the postverbal field: first the complements, then the non-complements, are analyzed as to their possibly complex internal structures. In principle every phrase can be related to another phrase in its direct neighborhood. This phrase again may dominate a subsequent phrase, etc., so that highly recursive structures may appear within a nominal complex (right-branches cascades). At the same time two related phrases may be disconnected by other phrases, when several phrases of different syntactical relations are dependent upon the same phrases. In addition to the potentially recursive structures, discontinuous relations must be detected as well. The algorithm NOMAL has been conceived especially for the solution of those recursions and discontinuities the complex nominal syntax (cf. 5). NOMAL is a procedural (sub)system similar to an ATN. Each syntactic function has its own procedure. The procedures are called successively by the main program whenever a pair of phrases — the head and the actual phrase — is examined. The identification of the relation that is — or is not — established between both phrases is governed by rules containing conditions for the head and the actual phrase. Each procedure is provided by a proper set of rules; the monitoring of the rule conditions is carried out by test operations on edges. If the testing of a rule attains a positive result — that is, if the conditions in this rule for head and actual phrase hold true — the phrases are unified and their relation interpreted according to the procedure where the rule was found. Valid conditions in the procedure PO, for example, have the effect that the relation between the phrases is identified as a prepositional complement/object. The approach is analogous for the remaining procedures.</abstract>

Linguistics, Volume 11, Numbers 2-3, April-September 1985 Axel Biewer, Christian F6neyrol, Johannes Ritzke, Erwin Stegentritt ASCOF The actual phrase having thus been attributed a function, it becomes the head itself in the next run; the actual phrase will then be the subsequent phrase. Analogously, further positive results gradually move the actual phrase to the head of the next run; the head is deferred to the right, thus allowing the correct analysis of recursive cascades. If none of the procedures attains a positive result, the new run is begun with another head, that is, with the phrase to the left of the head last tested. If there is still no positive result, the head keeps moving analogously to the left, until all the possibilities have been tried. The actual phrase is identical for all runs, thus allowing the analysis of relations between two discontinuous phrases. In every case, a boundary is reached when none of the runs offers a positive result. The former actual phrase then no longer belongs to the complex but rather indicates its boundary. The conditions denoted in the rules consist of morpho-syntactic and semantic information. Morphosyntactic information (e.g., an article, the form of an introductory preposition) can be read directly, the previous step of the analysis having made it available. In contrast, the semantic information must be deduced from the semantic network, which serves as a data base for the syntactic-functional analysis (cf. 4.4.4). The importance that evaluating rule conditions holds for the analysis shall be demonstrated in the following by the complex noun phrases in example (1). nominal complex regions du sud et les pays africains: Formal indicators can be checked at this point for the determination of the paratactic relation: in our examthe coordinating conjunction and the sequences of comma and conjunction may be evaluated as well. Yet the mere checking of such indicators is generally not sufficient for determining the proper parts of a coordination. In order to determine the correct parts, the semantics of the nouns must also be checked, that is, the closeness of the semantic relation between the candidates in question must be checked in the example. This is accomplished by retrieving operations within the semantic network using the nominal lexemes of the different phrases. The common generic place), which is reached by the two conditions: coordination indicator greatest semantic closeness. They are parts of coordination, the phrase sud recognized to be a prepositional complement/object of the first phrase by the procedure PO. The result is the structure: ((les regions (du sud)(P0)) (les pay africains)(C0)) nominal complex directive du Conseil du 20 juillet: For hypotactic relations, too, the examination of criteria is necessary and above that of the syntactic conditions. The search for a certain at the beginning of a clause — in our examan indicator of object references — must be performed by examining the semantic closeness of the nuclei (nouns) of the phrases. In the given example, the direct time indication, which suggests an attributive relation, is thus identified. In the network, a temporal attribution is closer to the information of &apos;act legislation&apos; (connected with the lexeme than to &apos;institution&apos; (connected with the actual reading the lexeme valid conditions exist for the relation of prepositional between directive for the relation prepositional attribute directive 20 juillet. last relation is discontinuous. The result of the analysis is the following structure: ((la directive (du Conseil)(P0))(du 20 juillet)(PA)) nominal complex augmentation du prix du mars de 3%: last non-complex phrase, 3%, this complex phrase holds a — likewise discontinuous — relation to first phrase, augmentation, the remaining de-phrases form a cascade and each depends upon its preceding phrase (the relation of prepositional complement/object). phrase 3%, indication of quantity, is closely related to the action, (action/state of affairs: increase), by the correspondedge configuration in the network than to of a measure) or to agricultural product). Accordingly, a relation is established 3% augmentation, the interposed phrases. The result is the following structure: ((une augmentation((du prix (du (de 3%)(PA))) nominal complex ce produit d&apos;importation: In order to determine the relation between the two phrases, formal criteria may be more readily applied than in the previous cases. The second phrase is characterized by the fact that neither a determinative nor an attributive element is contained or follows. Moreover, the nominal nucleus neither is in the plural nor is it a proper name. The phrase is introduced by the the characteristics are rule conditions for an actual phrase in the procedure prepositional complement/part of a compound. These conditions being fulfilled and no other candidate being present, the relation between the phrases may be determined in this particular case without semantic examinations. The result is the bracketing: (de ce produit (d&apos;importation)(PC)) As it is difficult in many cases, mainly in the postverbal field, to determine a function with certainty after a single run of the analysis of complex noun phrases, decisions are made only if there is no doubt (e.g., if there is Linguistics, Volume 11, Numbers 2-3, April-September 1985 Biewer, Christian Feneyrok Johannes Erwin Stegentritt ASCOF only one potential candidate or if candidates can be excluded because of semantic incompatibility, etc.). Otherwise a solution must be sought through repeated interaction with its complement analysis, which must then be given priority. Yet, given the basic alternative of the PP-attachment (complement, adverbial, part of a complex noun phrase), a reliable solution cannot always be found and several solutions may be admitted in such doubtful cases. 4.4.4 Conceding that structural descriptions within machine translation — functioning as the input for a transferring component and thus defining a sort of &amp;quot;interlingua&amp;quot; — cannot be established without semantic information, the appropriate form for representing this information as well as its integration into the analysis process appears to be controversial. With regard to the various ways of integrating semantic information, and above all to the proper moment of its integration, there are two extremely different points of view. On the one hand, syntax may be accorded absolute priority, in such a way that all syntactic and structural descriptions of a given input sentence are generated and only then semantically interpreted and filtered according to the semantic information. On the other hand, the analyzing algorithm can be guided by semantic information, the &amp;quot;level&amp;quot; of syntactic relations only being consulted as a secondary control mechanism. Most machine translation systems favor the first point of view, partly owing to the history of this science. Yet then, of course, the problem with highly complex sentences is how to deal with syntactic ambiguities. If, for example, an input sentence is attributed a number of tree structure by the syntax-driven analysis, part of the syntactic relations will necessarily be represented redundantly; if, on the other hand, the input sentence is attributed a chart or chart-like structural description by the syntactic analysis, much more time must be sacrificed to the semantic component — as a consequence of the more complex input structure. Semantically driven parsers, whose equivalents can be found in language-oriented guarantee a highly efficient parsing, but are extremely dependent upon their discourse area, due to their considerably limited &amp;quot;expectancy&amp;quot;, and generally operate on non-complex sentences, linguistically speaking. In order to isolate correct structural descriptions as soon as possible, cross-connections between syntax and semantics are established by the ASCOF system (cf. 4.4.2). This is to say that semantic information is made available for the identification of syntactic-functional relations and that, vice versa, syntactic and functional relations can be used for semantic interpretation (disambiguation). The flow of information between syntax and semantic is therefore not based on a phase model (e.g., the sequential operations of separate modules). The semantic information in the ASCOF system is stored in a semantic network. (For different conceptions of semantic networks, cf., above all, Findler (1979).) The implementation of the network structure is based the structure &amp;quot;dictionary&amp;quot;, which is a string-indexed array (of variable length) over strings (of variable length) that can be held externally. &amp;quot;Of variable length&amp;quot; means that a string can be of any size so that its length is only limited by the memory space of the machine.

The relation defined by denoting edges thus takes into account the linguistic phenomena of synonymy and polysemy. ISA edges, which define a special implicit relation, are important for two reasons. First, they allow the defining of a sort of semantic distance between linguistic units, and second, they economically administer information deducible by inheritance paths. Semantic distance in the linguistic sense may be of importance for the correct identification of coordinative structures.

The analysis yields no interlingual structures but rather structures more closely related to the source language. These are represented by canonical trees. At the same time, due to the interaction between syntax and semantics, many of the lexical ambiguities are resolved. Before starting ASCOF&apos;s final two phases of transfer and synthesis, any remaining ambiguities must be cleared up especially by means of further semantic information. 4.5 4.5.1 The phases of the system subsequent to the analysis include a transformation component (transfer and syntactic synthesis) and a morphological synthesis. In the transfer phase, the source language lemmata are first replaced by their target language equivalents. Here it is not sufficient to merely exchange lexemes since target language differences of a lexical nature arising from syntax and/or semantics need to be borne in mind. Instead, the replacement process must take into consideration the information contained in the analysis tree, for example, the syntactic and semantic verb frame actualization. Subsequent to the lexical transfer, the analysis structures are transferred to the structures appropriate to the target language (syntactic synthesis). This transfer is implemented as a transformation algointerprets externally stored rules (transformation instructions). Linguistic data and algorithm are thus strictly separated from one another so that this component may also be used for other language pairs. The transformation algorithm runs through the analysis tree in preorder, tests for each node whether a package of rules exists for the given node label and — provided that the conditions of a rule are fulfilled — carries out the instructions that refer to some few elementary operations. The conditions and the transformation instructions can refer to both subtrees and the attributevalue pairs associated with the node. (For example, the inheritance of the target language gender of the head of a NOG to attribute and determiner complex.) 4.5.2 The input for the morphological synthesis is the labeled tree taken from the syntactic synthesis. In contrast to the syntactic synthesis, the morphological synthesis operates only locally, in other words, the pre-terminal nodes are examined and processed isolated from each other. Tree transformations are thus no longer carried out. The basic forms of the lexemes and the morpho-syntactic information from the pre-terminal nodes serve as keys that call the appropriate rule of the morphological generative grammar. Grammar and algorithm are separate. The grammar for the morphological synthesis of German is able to generate German word forms, provided that the necessary information supplied from all of the preceding phases is complete and accurate. PROSPECTS The ASCOF system has been implemented in the sections described in the present paper and has in part already been tested. Here we have a version that covers syntactic structures and vocabulary based on texts (EC bulletins) taken from the agricultural sphere. The vocabulary of this sphere is completely covered on the morpho-syntactic level. As yet, owing to the complexity of the semantics, the semantic data bases (semantic network) has been developed only as a prototype. The improvement of .the quality of the translations performed by ASCOF is basically dependent upon the development and elaboration of the semantic networks.</abstract>

Figure 1a), is to group together isolated verb elements (finite verbs, participle I, participle II, infinitive) within a segment to assign a structural description to these phrases (e.g., to determine VOICE and TENSE) and — ultimately — to interpret those phrases as nodes of a tree structure. The grammar of the verbal analysis is conceived as a two-step ATN (cf. Biewer 1985). The transitions between the different states of the ATN are guided primarily by a subclassification of verb elements (e.g., participle II of avoir). The conception of the ATN enables the processing of an unlimited number of infinitive phrases; the integration of these infinitive phrases into the tree structure is governed by categorial information — recorded in dictionaries — as well as by tests concerning the syntactic context. Nevertheless, the interpretation of non-complex infinitive phrases as nodes of a dependency tree does not exclude ambiguities that cannot be resolved at this stage o</context>

Unknown word forms undergo a derivational analysis (based on Stegentritt 1978). 4.3 Within ASCOF&apos;s PHASE II, we can distinguish two different parts, both realized by means of context-free grammars; in the first part, categorial (word class) ambiguities are resolved through a CFG working on the string of word classes issued from PHASE I. By applying this grammar, we obtain one — or possibly more — string(s) of unequivocal word classes. [A special word class problem occurring in French, concerning the ambiguity of (-ant) forms, is discussed in Feneyrol (1982).] As the consulted grammar itself represents a rudimentary syntactic analysis, here we arrive at an initial decomposition of the sentence into so-called simple syntactic units, such as nominal, prepositional, adjectival, adverbial, and verb units; (coordinating and subordinating) conjunctions, introducing words (relative pronouns and others), and commas form proper units, too.

Other projects of the SFB 100 have been developing the programming language COMSKEE and the systems SUSY and SUSY II. ASCOF is an independent system especially conceived for French and German. General descriptions of ASCOF are given in Feneyrol, Ritzke, and Stegentritt (1984) and Stegentritt (1983).

Mueller-von Brochowski et al. (1981), Messerschmidt ( 1984) .) For the computer scientist, COMSKEE is a procedural (imperative) format-free, block-oriented programming language such as ALGOL and Pascal, yet comprising some of the qualities of functional languages (such as LISP or PROLOG).

[For more details, cf. Ritzke (1985).] The following syntactic-functional relations are defined for the analysis: — head-function of the central phrase of a complex (la maison du pere) — paratactic relations of phrases depending on the head: coordination (CO): the coordinated phrase has the same syntactic function as the phrase with which it is coordinated (l&apos; etude de la determination et de la classification). apposition (AP): a paratactic relation on the level of syntactic analysis (du froment tendre, plante comestible qui . . . ) — hypotactic relations of phrases depending on the head: prepositional complement/object (PO): si</context>

Much space is devoted to segment analysis, the interaction of the complement analysis and the analysis of complex noun phrases, which is discussed in detail and illustrated by examples. 4.2 PHASE I of the analysis consists of the sentence/text input and the morphological analysis. Each word form is assigned the set of possible categories as well as the morpho-syntactic information. A full form and a stem dictionary (both approximately 47,000 entries) as well as a suffix dictionary (inflectional suffixes) are available. Unknown word forms undergo a derivational analysis (based on Stegentritt 1978). 4.3 Within ASCOF&apos;s PHASE II, we can distinguish two different parts, both realized by means of context-free grammars; in the first part, categorial (word class) ambiguities are resolved through a CFG working on the string of word classes issued from PHASE I. By applying this grammar, we obtain one — or possibly more — string(s) of unequivocal word classes. [A special word class problem occurring in French, concerning the ambiguity of (-ant) forms, is discussed in Feneyrol (1982).] As the consulted grammar itself represents a rudimentary syntactic analysis, here we arrive at an initial decomp</context>

The remaining phrases are parts of complex noun or prepositional phrases or of adverbials. For the preverbal and postverbal fields, complement analysis operates separately, reflecting the dissimilar structure of both fields. The component SUB, operating in the preverbal field, defines subjects of nondominated verbs as well as possibly occurring pronominal complements; dominated verbs (e.g., causative constructions) are analyzed by another component, not described in this paper (INFSUB, cf. Stegentritt (1982, 1984)). In the postverbal field, the components K1 and K2 are activated for the complement analysis. In every case, only the first constituent of the complement is determined. Then the component NOMAL (cf. 4.4.3) is called and investigates the structure of the identified complement. The component determining the subject (SUB) is bipartite; in addition to the preverbal pronominal complements, the first part also defines the subject, provided that it is a pronominal subject. If there is no pronominal subject, part two defines a nominal subject. In the first part, the analysis progresses from r</context>

Vauquois 1975) have been adopted: analysis, transfer, and synthesis. The result of the sentence analysis is represented as a standardized tree structure, which then serves as input for the transfer and synthesis of the target language. 3.2 The ASCOF analysis takes place in three steps based on different grammar and algorithm types. The morphological analysis PHASE I is carried out by an algorithm that realizes actually a mere pattern matching; in PHASE II context-free grammars identify non-complex syntactic phrases and the macrostructure of the sentence. A reduction in the homographies of word classes is si</context>

The changes of structure are carried out by a transformational grammar. The grammar operates on trees; grammar and algorithm are separate from each other and the algorithm interprets the externally stored rules of the grammar. [The documentation of the transformational component is put forward by Reding (1985); for the discussion of transformation grammars in machine translation, cf. Vauquois (1975), Boitet, Guillaume and Quezel-Ambrunaz (1982), and Huckert (1979).] On the leaves of the output tree, produced by the syntactic synthesis, a further algorithm operates, which interprets a set of morphological rules in order to generate the correct word forms of the target language. The transfer and synthesis components of ASCOF are shown in Figure lb. The separation of grammar and algorithms allows the application of the above-mentioned components in other languages as well, provided that the grammar is replaced. 4 LINGUISTIC TECHNIQUES AND COMPUTATIONAL REALIZATION 4.1 The most sophisticated</context>

This phase of analysis is performed by algorithms similar to ATN, representing an interactive system. [The term interactive system might be problematic in this context as this term often denotes components interacting with the user. Here we are concerned with the process communication between different components.] Consequently, the ASCOF analysis does not constitute a one-pass parser but a system of parsers (cf. Figure la). The strategy applied resembles that of cascaded ATNs (Woods 1980) and was chosen for the following reason: the complexity and length of the sentences to be analyzed require — for reasons of efficiency — parsing strategies appropriate to the different problems, that is, context-free grammars for PHASE II, which works exclusively with syntactic information, and formalisms similar to ATN for PHASE III, where syntactic and semantic information is combined. A similar combination of syntax and semantics often occurs in modern parsers of various orientations, e.g., in the determinism parser put forward by Marcus (1980, chap. 10). This approach not only allows a st</context>
