1. Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9995002">
This handbook is different from most books reviewed on these pages in that it is
the result of, and a driving force in, a complex process of planned European-style
international cooperation. Thus, it should be reviewed not only for content, but also
for its role in this process.
Let me start by briefly describing the cooperative process. EAGLES (Expert Advi-
sory Group on Language Engineering Standards) is an initiative of the Commission of
the European Union, whose purposes include producing specifications and guidelines,
and encouraging cooperation between industry and academia, and between European
countries. The initiative comprised five working groups, one of which—the Spoken
Language Working Group, WG5—is responsible for the handbook under review.

2. Content
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998614">
The authors interpret the concept of spoken language systems broadly, and include any
system whose key components consist of speech technologies such as automatic speech
recognition (ASR), speech synthesis (SS or TTS), speaker verification, and coding.
This book is not meant as a textbook for these technologies, although the authors
mention that it may serve as an introductory text in some cases. Instead, its stated goals
are that of supplying reference materials for researchers and developers working in
these areas, providing information on common practice in Europe for non-Europeans,
and delivering guidance on systems specification and assessment for corporate end
users.
Besides a massive bibliography and a 170-page section listing spoken language
reference materials, the book has three main sections. The first, &amp;quot;Spoken language and
corpus design,&amp;quot; covers system design (written by Choukri), SL corpus design (den
Os), SL corpus collection (Draxler), and SL corpus representation (den Os); the second
section, &amp;quot;Spoken language characterization,&amp;quot; contains SL lexica (Gibbon), language
models (Ney), and physical characterization and description (Knohl and Kraft); and the
third section, &amp;quot;Spoken language system assessment,&amp;quot; has chapters on methodologies
and experimental design (Howell), recognition systems (van Leeuwen and Steeneken),
speaker verification systems (Bimbot and Chollet), synthesis systems (van Bezooijen
and van Heuven), and interactive systems (Fraser).
These chapters vary widely in depth and level of sophistication. The chapters

by Ney and by Bimbot and Chollet are quite technical—and also quite good—but
require the reader to almost be a specialist in their respective areas. On the other hand,
the chapter by Howell on statistics and experimental design is at the level of a first
statistics course for undergraduate psychology students. Because much assessment is
multidimensional, I would have liked to see more material on multivariate statistical
inference, multidimensional scaling, and clustering. But the chapter is clearly written
and well-organized.
The chapter by Ney on language modeling techniques for ASR raises the issue
of why the book does not contain similar chapters on speech synthesis components.
For example, a chapter on certain broad classes of text analysis such as morphological
decomposition, pronunciation dictionaries, or sense disambiguation would not have
been out of place.
An issue that I find insufficiently emphasized in the section on assessment is that
of coverage and generalizability across applications and textual genres. In the case of
ASR, the standard assessment procedure is to use the bulk of a corpus for training,
and the remainder for tests. Since both test and training samples are drawn from
the same corpus, and since most corpora have some degree of homogeneity (e.g., in
terms of vocabulary, syntactic style, or topic) this means that good performance on test
samples may be a poor predictor of performance on samples outside of the corpus.
This raises issues about the relevance of such assessment results when a user wants
to use a system in an application with textual materials different from those used in
the assessment.
In the case of TTS assessment, with some notable exceptions, most evaluation
procedures use a fixed, known, and generally small set of test items. Since many
components of TTS systems can be easily fine-tuned, there is no reason why developers
would not make sure that their system operates properly for some of these textual
materials. The reason that TTS systems can be so easily fine-tuned is that several of
their components are list-like, such as pronunciation dictionaries, concatenative units,
and various types of rules (assuming interactions that are not too severe). With such
components, one can alter a few items without having much effect on how the system
processes other inputs. This contrasts with speech coding systems, where alterations
in components generally affect performance on any input, not merely on the 150 most
frequent Belgian surnames.
On balance, however, there is a wealth of material here that until now was not
available in this convenient form. The editors should also be lauded for the book&apos;s
overall organization; for one, I found the recommendation chapters in each section par-
ticularly helpful.

3. Is Speech Technology Ready for a Handbook?
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998967363636364">
This review would not be complete without discussing the state of speech technology
itself. After all, the existence of a handbook may be taken to imply a certain level of
maturity, and it is important to ask whether this level indeed has been reached and,
if not, what harm there is in pretending it has been reached.
The candid truth about speech technology is that, whereas predictions of future
computer hardware performance have been generally proven to be accurate or even
pessimistic, predictions of progress in speech technology have been consistently too
optimistic. For at least two decades, there has been a sliding five-year window within
which speech technology would produce systems that understand us and talk with
voices hard to distinguish from human speech. With few exceptions, current speech
technologies work well only under conditions that are highly restrictive in terms of

domain, user, or both. For example, ASR systems that are currently sufficiently reliable
to be used as more than a toy all lie on a curve between, on the one hand, systems for
speaker-independent word-spotting with extremely small vocabularies, and, on the
other hand, systems for large-vocabulary speaker-dependent dictation requiring vast
amounts of training by the user.
Most of the progress made is due to vast improvements in computer hardware
allowing better parameter estimation and more expansive searches, to availability of
large speech and text corpora, and to algorithmic and statistical innovations. Remark-
ably few contributions have come from &amp;quot;science,&amp;quot; by which I refer to the study of
human speech and language production and understanding in traditional academic
fields such as linguistics, psycholinguistics, neuroscience, physiology and acoustics. A
fundamental question is to what degree current disappointing performance levels are
due to this state of affairs, and how to remedy this. Although I personally would much
like to believe that these traditional academic fields have critically important contri-
butions to make, they may need to be reorganized to become more multidisciplinary
and more receptive to concepts and ideas coming from technology.
The benefit of a handbook is that it is an important tool for speech and language
researchers in any field, and also helps to bring together researchers from a variety of
disciplines. Thus, it could help in making the field more multidisciplinary and thereby
produce a better balance between science and technology in this area.
There is a subtle danger, however, in pretending that the field is more mature than
it really is—a pretense not unique to this book; one can sense it at any speech technol-
ogy conference. The danger is that it sends two messages: a message to corporate and
governmental funding organizations that their investments have a high probability
of quickly producing concrete results; and a message to students entering the field
that a substantial fraction of scientific and technological issues have been resolved. If
it is not the case that speech technology has passed the threshold of maturity, then
funding organizations misallocate scarce resources and students do not ask sufficiently
provocative questions.

4. Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999916111111111">
There is no doubt that the processes that have culminated in the production of this
book have been beneficial for the European speech technology community. The book
is likely to have a major influence on standards committees and other such organiza-
tions. This influence will probably be very beneficial, because the book was written
by authors who are experts in their respective fields and do not represent narrow
commercial or local interests. In addition, it represents a broader consensus than is
usually present in these committees and organizations.
The book brings together in one volume information that up to now was essentially
inaccessible because it was so widely dispersed. Some chapters are well-written and
lucid and would be useful teaching tools. But there are some omissions from the book,
and the level of difficulty varies widely between chapters.
In other words, the book seems to have largely reached its objectives. But, as I
have argued above, a book of this high degree of visibility will also have unintended
consequences. I have pointed out a somewhat subtle consequence—which is that it
strengthens the portrayal of speech technology as scientifically more advanced than
it in fact is—and that this may hamper scientific progress. On balance, however, the
use of the book as a resource for working scientists is likely to easily outweigh this
potential consequence.
