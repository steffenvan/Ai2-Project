This paper addresses discourse structure from the perspective of understanding.
It would perhaps help us understand the nature of discourse relations if we better under-
stood what units of a text. can be related to 01W another. In one major theory of discourse
structure, Rhetorical Structure Theory (Mann&amp; Thompson 1988; hereafter simply RST), the
smallest possible linguistic units that can participate in a rhetorical relation are called units,
and &amp;quot;are essentially clauses, except that clausal subjects and complements and restricted rel-
ative clauses are considered as parts of their host clause units rather than as separate units&amp;quot;
[p. 248]. But both Dale and Meteer (in these proceedings) point out that rhetorical relations
can appear within clausal units. (Dale&apos;s argument will be discussed at the end of this paper.)
For example, the relation that is expressed in two clauses in (1.2) is expressed in only one
clause in (1.1) (from Meteer, these procee(Iings):

1.2 Because I flicked the switch, the light turned on.

Similarly, Hwang &amp; Schubert (1992), in their work on recognizing temporal relations among
episodes in discourse, argue for a, &amp;quot;fine structure&amp;quot; of discourse, in which temporal relations
can be established even among episodes of subordinate clauses.
This paper points out another discourse phenomenon that calls for a &amp;quot;fine structure&amp;quot;
of discourse. In passages containing attitudc reports—reports of agents&apos; beliefs, knowledge,
intentions, perceptions, etc.—rhetorical relations can hold such that one or more of the lin-
guistic units involved in a relation is only part of a sentence.&apos; In softie cases, such a unit
may be smaller than the smallest possible unit in R.ST. Specifically, only the complement
of an attitude report, rather than the entire sentence, might be involved in some particular
relation. (An example is (2) below, which will be discussed shortly.) To make matters more
concrete, we will consider short passages in which an attitude report participates in a relation
indicated by the cue phrase &apos;but&apos;, where &apos;but&apos; is being used to connect clauses.
&apos;Note that this paper is meant to illustrate some complexities that. I believe require attention. Undoubtedly,
similar discourse structures occur that do not involve attitude reports.

Consider the following passage:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9599005">
(2) 2.1 John knew that Mary had never been introduced to Sam.
2.2 But she had been introduced to Derek.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998268307692307">
One reading of this passage is that (2.2), as well as (2.1), presents an attitude of John.
Imagine that (2) appears in a narrative in which John is forming a plan, and whom Mary has
and has not met is somehow important to this plan. Under this reading, (2.2) is an example
of a sentence that presents the attitude of some agent X, even though X nor the attitude
are mentioned in the sentence. (Detecting such sentences specifically in third-person fictional
narrative text was the focus of previous work; see Wiebe 1990.)
Notice that &apos;But&apos; in (2.2) is being used to connect clauses, and not in addition to mark
the beginning of a new discourse segment (as the term discourse segnient is used in Grosz Kr.
Sidner 1986). The question we are asking is what clauses are being connected by &apos;But&apos; in (2)?
Under the reading described above, the following are the clauses participating in the relation:
Mary had never been introduced to Sam. [the complement of (2.1)]
But she had been introduced to Derek.
Contrast (2) with (3):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.990992">
(3) 3.1 John thought that Richard had stabbed hint in the back.
3.2 But John was often too suspicious of Richard.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99956475">
In (3), the entire sentences (3.1) and (3.2) participate in the relation indicated by &apos;But&apos;.
Deciding which linguistic units are involved in a relation is not sufficient for understanding
how they are related, of course. Generally speaking, knowledge about the world and/or
what the speaker or writer is trying to accomplish in the discourse (Moore &amp; Pollack 1992)
would presumably be involved in arriving at the actual contrasts being made in (2) and (3)
(or whatever sorts of relations are being indicated by &apos;Bur). But to hope to arrive at an
understanding of such texts, an NMI system must entertain the possibility that one or more
of the linguistic units involved in the relation may be only a clausal complement.
Following is another short passage in which &apos;but&apos; indicates a. relation involving an attitude
report. For this passage, RST units are sufficiently fine-grained. The passage is of interest to
us here because the main clause of the second sentence, (4.3), is not involved in the relation
(what are numbered in this passage are RST units):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.998703">
(4) 4.1 The car was finally coming toward him.
4.2 He finished his diagnostic tests, 4.3 feeling relief.
4.4 But then the car started to turn right.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9491635">
The relation indicated by `But&apos; is between his relief at the car coming toward hint ((4.1) and
(4.3) together) and the car then turning right (4.4). That is, for the purpose of understanding
the relation indicated by &apos;But&apos;, (4.1) and (4.3) are grouped together, which are in turn grouped
with (4.4). But there are clearly also narrative relations to be recognized in this passage (e.g.,
(4.2) and (4.4) are in a sequence relation), which involve other groupings of the clauses. Many
(such as Moore Kt Pollack 1992, and Dale, Hughes St. McCoy, Meteer, and Moser Kt Moore in

these proceedings) have noted that more than one type of relation can simultaneously hold
among elements of the discourse; we see another example of this here. In discourses presenting
attitudes, because they present states, events, and objects as well as attitudes toward them,
a linguistic. unit can be involved in more than one kind of relation, possibly grouped with
different units.
I used &amp;quot;grouped&amp;quot; above for lack of a. completely appropriate term from the literature. It
would be good to talk about these groupings as discourse segments of the linguistic structure
of Grosz &amp; Sidner&apos;s theory, to distinguish linguistic structure from the non-linguistic basis for
that structure. This would be misleading, however, because discourse is structured in Grosz
gr. Sidner&apos;s theory on the basis of intentions. A rhetorical relation holding between pieces
of a discourse, such as the one indicated by &apos;But&apos; in (4), does not necessarily make them
into a discourse segment (see Grosz k Shiner 1086, p. 188, Moore gt. Paris 1992, p. 46, and
Dale, these proceedings, for (liscussion). Another possible term is IVIann &amp; Thompson&apos;s text
span, which suggests (at least in practice) segments that. are either units, or composed only of
adjacent units (excluding, for example, a segment composed of (4.1) and (4.3) together with
(4.4)).
The examples given above do not illustrate the range of possible discourse structures
in which attitude reports participate. I ant currently analyzing text segments (from on-line
texts) that contain both attitude terms and particular cue phrases to try to identify the various
possibilities. My goal is to develop a mechanism that uses syntactic and lexical knowledge
to identify the segments involved in the relation. Without access to world and/or intentional
knowledge, such a mechanism could produce only likely hypotheses; the idea is to see if
information extracted by the non-discourse components of an overall NLU system could be
used to constrain processing at deeper levels (Wiebe 1990, Bergler to appear, Pa.ssonneatt
Litman 1993, and Hirschberg Sr, Litman to appear each address using one or more of syntactic,
lexical, orthographic, and intonational information to perform discourse tasks).
In summary, in discourses with attitude reports, (A) linguistic units smaller than RST
units may be involved in a. discourse relation, and (B) a single linguistic unit may be involved in
more than one kind of relation, possibly together with different linguistic units. As mentioned
above, others have also noted (A) and (B). Dale makes the interesting argument that, among
other things, (A) and (B) suggest that we should banish those rhetorical relations which simply
mirror underlying knowledge-base relations, ht many cases, he points out, rhetorical relations
are simply subject-matter relations—in establishing such relations, all we are really doing is
identifying knowledge-base relations between entities mentioned in the discourse. With this
in mind, the fact that we find many instances of (A) and (B) is not, surprising. Since various
syntactic constituents evoke various objects, states, and events, it is not surprising that one
can find discourse relations (mirroring knowledge-ba.se relations) that involve various pieces
of sentences.
I think that Dale makes sonic very good points. As I suggested above, one finds structures
such as the ones illustrated in this pa.per because discourses can present attitudes towards
things as well as presenting those things themselves. Thus, we find relations among parts of
sentences evoking only the objects of attitudes, a,s well as among those evoking the attitudes

themselves, Further, I certainly do not disagree with Dale&apos;s suggestion that focusing on those
rhetorical relations that are clearly not domain relations would be a way to better understand
communicative intentions.
Given a rich knowledge base, however, out of all of the possible knowledge-base relations
that can hold among all the things evoked in a discourse, only some are intended to be picked
out as the basis for coherence. (If we allow default inference, the number of possible relations
is astounding.) Hobbs (1979), among others, argues this. As such, certain groupings of
linguistic units, i.e., those evoking the things involved in these relations, are more important
than others for establishing coherence. Perhaps the ideal discourse model is one in which the
process of arriving at these groupings and associated relations is governed by a. process of
intention recognition. But investigating local coherence directly—how it manifests itself in
various contexts in naturally-occurring texts, and how non-pragmatic information might be
exploited to recognize it—could provide important constraints for intention-based models.
