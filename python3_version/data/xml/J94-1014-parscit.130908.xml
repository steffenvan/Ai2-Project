This book sets out to explore the global prop-
erties of texts, focusing on what is known as
texture. Stoddard defines texture as
... the result of overlaying
... the patterns created by the
readers&apos; perceptions of the con-
tent, the rhetorical structure, and
the linguistic structure of the
physical text so that, at any
given point in the reading pro-
cess, the texture may be similar
to or different from that at some
other point. (p. 4)
The author hypothesizes that patterns of co-
hesion relations, displayed graphically, can
illustrate the rudiments of texture. Thirty-five
English texts taken from five genres (nonfic-
tion, essays, biographies, novels, and short
stories) are hand-labeled with three types
of cohesion relations: definite articles, pro-
nouns, and verbs with agent displacements
(i.e., the verb&apos;s agent role is filled by a con-
stituent not in the subject position). A text&apos;s
&amp;quot;cohesion map&amp;quot; is created by assigning to
each word a location on a two-dimensional
grid corresponding to the word&apos;s position
in the text (roughly, each sentence corre-
sponds to a row), and then drawing a line
between the location of a cohesive element
and the location of its original referent. The
resulting map looks somewhat like a column
of hanging pine-needle bunches; thus texts
can be compared visually for properties such
as burstiness, density, and connection span.
Each kind of cohesive element is assigned its
own map, although for one example all three
cohesion maps are superimposed.
The resulting maps seem to illustrate in-
teresting differences among the texts. Unfor-
tunately, the author neither describes how to
analyze these maps nor explores the effects
of multiple interacting types of cohesion ele-
ments. Instead, the analysis focuses on com-
paring text genres based on their overall &amp;quot;rel-
ative cohesiveness.&amp;quot; The leap from elucidat-
ing a text&apos;s style or texture to comparing texts
for relative cohesion on the basis of three syn-
tactic cues (one of which tends to occur only
rarely and almost never extra-sententially) is
not well justified by the early parts of the
book. Perhaps for this reason, there are two
significant problems with the way relative
cohesiveness is computed.
First, the author assumes that nonfiction
text is less cohesive than other genres such as
biographies and fiction (footnote, p. 55). By
far the most frequently occurring of the three
cohesion relations that the author examines
is pronominal reference (p. 68); lexical co-
hesion relations are excluded. However, as
the author points out, biographies and fiction
tend to have many pronominal references,
whereas nonfiction texts tend to have few
pronominal references but many lexical co-
hesion relations. So in effect the result of the
comparison is pre-determined. Despite these
problems, the author concludes that the def-
initions and procedures used are satisfactory
(p. 96).
The second problem with this analysis is
that the comparison is based on a &amp;quot;cohesion
index,&amp;quot; which is determined by multiply-
ing the average number of cohesive elements
corresponding to a referent by the average
distance between the elements and their ref-
erent. This number is meant to indicate the
relative cohesiveness of a text, but does not
discriminate between a referent that has only
a few, distant references and a referent that
has a large number of nearby references.
Bearing in mind that this is cross-
disciplinary work (the author apparently
originates from a literary field), a reader
of Computational Linguistics may be put off
by outdated references to the artificial in-
telligence literature and weak discussions of
computational issues in general.
The author is to be commended for work-
ing with a large number of lengthy texts,
a rare precedent in discourse analysis. The
idea of graphically displaying the interac-
tions of the syntactic cohesive elements is a
useful one. The next important steps are to
explore how to represent multiple interacting
cue types, and how to analyze or interpret
the resulting illustrations; this may lead to a
better understanding of texture and cohesion
in written texts. â€”Marti Hearst, University of
