<bodyText confidence="0.9999391">
The paper adresses the problem of reasoning with
ambiguities. Semantic representations are presented
that leave scope relations between quantifiers and/or
other operators unspecified. Truth conditions are
provided for these representations and different con-
sequence relations are judged on the basis of intuitive
correctness. Finally inference patterns are presented
that operate directly on these underspecified struc-
tures, i.e. do not rely on any translation into the set
of their disambiguations.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.99999098">
Whenever we hear a sentence or read a text we build
up mental representations in which some aspects of
the meaning of the sentence or text are left underspe-
cified. And if we accept what we have heard or read
as true, then we will use these underspecified repre-
sentations as premisses for arguments. The challenge
is, therefore, to equip underspecified semantic repre-
sentations with well-defined truth conditions and to
formulate inference patterns for these representati-
ons that follow the arguments that we judge as in-
tuitively correct. Several proposals exist for the de-
finition of the language, but only very few authors
have addressed the problem of defining a logic of
ambiguous reasoning.
[8] considers lexical ambiguities and investigates
structural properties of a number of consequence re-
lations based on an abstract notion of coherency. It
is not clear, however, how this approach could be
extended to other kinds of ambiguities, especially
quantifier scope ambiguities and ambiguities trigge-
red by plural NPs. [1], [7] and [6] deal with ambigui-
ties of the latter kind. They give construction rules
and define truth conditions according to which an
underspecified representation of an ambiguous sent-
ence is true if one of its disambiguations is. The pro-
blem of reasoning is adressed only in [5] and [7]. [5]&apos;s
inference schemata yield a very weak logic only; and
[7]&apos;s deductive component is too strong. Being weak
and strong depends of course on the underlying con-
sequence relation. Neither [5] nor [7] make any att-
empt to systematically derive the consequence rela-
tion that holds for reasoning with ambiguities on the
basis of an empirical discussion of intuitively valid
arguments.
The present paper starts out with such a discussion
in Section 2. Section 3 gives a brief introduction to
the theory of UDRSs. It gives a sketch of the princip-
les to construct UDRSs and shows how scope ambi-
guities of quantifiers and negation are represented in
an underspecified way. As the rules of inference pre-
sented in [7] turn out to be sound also with respect
to the consequence relation defined in Section 2 the-
se rules (for the fragment without disjunction) will
be discussed only briefly in Section 4. The change
in the deduction system that is imposed by the new
consequence relation comes with the rules of proof.
Section 5 shows that it is no longer possible to use
rules like Conditionalisation or Reductio ad Absur-
dum when we deal with real ambiguities in the goal.
An alternative set of rules is presented in Section 6.

In this section we will discuss some sample argu-
ments containing ambiguous expressions in the data
as well as in the goal. We consider three kinds of am-
biguities: lexical ambiguities, quantifier scope ambi-
guities, and ambiguities with respect to distributi-
ve/collective readings of plural noun phrases. The
discussion of the arguments will show that the mea-
ning of ambiguous sentences not only depends on
the set of its disambiguations. Their meanings al-
so depend on the context, especially on other oc-
currences of ambiguities. Each disambiguation of an
ambiguous sentence may be correlated to disambi-
guations of other ambiguous sentences such that the
choice of the first disambiguation also determines the
choice of the latter ones, and vice versa. Thus the re-
presentation of ambiguities requires some means to
implement these correlations.
To see that this is indeed the case let us start discus-
sing some consequence relations that come to mind
when dealing with ambiguous reasoning. The first
one we will consider is the one that allows to derive

a(n ambiguous) conclusion -y from a set of (ambi-
guous) premisses r if some disambiguation of 7 fol-
lows from all readings of F. Assuming that (5 and (5&apos;

ambiguities as being equivalent to the disjunctions of
their readings. To interpret ambiguities in this way
is, however, not correct. For ambiguities in the goal
this is witnessed by (2).
(2) k Everybody slept or everybody didn&apos;t sleep.
Intuitively (2) is contingent, but would — according
to the relation in (1) — be classified as a tautology.
In this case the consequence relation in (3) gives the
correct result and therefore seems to be preferable.

To do justice to both, the examples in (2) and Refle-
xivity, we would have to interpret ambiguous sent-
ences in the data also as conjunctions of their rea-

Given the examples in (5) we are back to (1) and may
think that ambiguities in the data are interpreted as
disjunctions of their readings. But irrespective of the
incompatibility with Reflexivity this picture cannot
be correct either, because it distroys the intuitively
valid inference in (6).

This example shows that disambiguation is not an
operation (5 that takes (a set of) isolated sentences.
Ambiguous sentences of the same type have to be
disambiguated simultaneously.&apos; Thus the meaning of
&apos;We will not give a classification or definition of am-
biguities of the same type here. Three major classes will
consist of lexical ambiguities, ambiguities with respect
to distributive/collective readings of plural noun phra-
ses, and quantifier scope ambiguities. As regards the last
type we assume on the one hand that only sentences
with the same argument structure and the same set of
readings can be of the same type. More precisely, if two
sentences are of the same type with respect to quanti-
fier scope ambiguities, then the labels of their UDRS&apos;s

al represents the first and a2 the second reading of
the second sentence of (6).

We will call sentence representations that have to
be disambiguated simultaneously correlated ambi-
guities. The correlation may be expressed by coinde-
xing. Any disambiguation that simultaneously di-
sambiguates a set of representations coindexed with
i is a disambiguation that respects i, in symbols 6. A
disambiguation (5 that respects all indices of a given
set I is said to respect I, written 81. Let I be a set
of indices, then the consequence relation we assume
to underly ambiguous reasoning is given in (8)

The general picture we will follow in this paper is the
following. We assume that a set of representations I&apos;
represents the mental state of a reasoning agent R.
F contains underspecified representations. Correlati-
ons between elements of r indicate that they share
possible ways of disambiguation. Suppose -y is only
implicitly contained in F. Then R may infer it from
F and make it explicit by adding it to its mental
state. This process determines the consequence rela-
tion relative to which we develop our inference pat-
terns. That means we do not consider the case where
R is asked some query -y by another person B. The
additional problem in this case consists in the array
of possibilities to establish correlations between B&apos;s
query and R&apos;s data, and must be adressed within a
proper theory of dialogue.
Consider the following examples. The data contains
two clauses. The first one is ambiguous, but not in
the context of the second.

If the inference is now seen as the result of R&apos;s task
to make the first sentence explicit (which of course
is trivial here), then the goal will not be ambiguous,
because it simply is another occurrence of the repre-
sentation in the data, and, therefore, will carry the
same correlation index. In the second case, i.e. the
case where the goal results from R&apos;s processing some
external input, there is no guarantee for such a cor-
relation. R might consider the goal as ambiguous,
and hence will not accept it as a consequence. (B
might after all have had in mind just that reading
of the sentence that is not part of R&apos;s knowledge.)

sentences may carry an ambiguity of the same type if
one results from the other by applying Detachment to a

The base for unscoped representations proposed in
[7] is the separation of information about the struc-
ture of a particular semantic form and of the content
of the information bits the semantic form combines.
In case the semantic form is given by a DRS its struc-
ture is given by the hierarchy of subDRSs, that is de-
termined by V and 0. We will represent this
hierarchy explicitly by the subordination relation &lt;.
The semantic content of a DRS consists of the set of
its discourse referents and its conditions. To be more
precise, we express the structural information by a
language with one predicate &lt; that relates individu-
al constants 1, called labels. The constants are names
for DRS&apos;s. &lt; corresponds to the subordination rela-
tion between them, i.e. the set of labels with &lt; is a
upper semilattice with one-element (denoted by /T).
Let us consider the DRSs (11) and (12) representing
the two readings of (10).
(10) Everybody didn&apos;t pay attention.

x x pay attention

(14) is already the UDRS that represents (10) with
scope relationships left unresolved. We call the no-
des of such graphs UDRS-components. Each UDRS-
component consists of a labelled DRS and two func-
tions scope and res, which map labels of UDRS-
components to the labels of their scope and restric-
tor, respectively. DRS-conditions are of the form
(Q, 41, 42), with quantifier Q, restrictor 41 and scope
42, of the form 41 -42, or of the form 4:—,/,1 . A
UDRS is a set of UDRS-components together with
a partial order ORD of its labels.

case ORD is fli &lt; scope(12), 13 scope(11)} we get
a description of (12). If ORD is {13 &lt; scope(li),13
scope(12)} then (15) represents (14), because it only
contains the information common to both, (11) and
(12).
In any case ORD lists only the subordination re-
lations that are neither implicitly contained in the
partial order nor determined by complex UDRS-
conditions. This means that (15) implicitly contains
the information that, e.g., res(12) &lt; IT, and also that

thout disjunction. For reason of space we cannot con-
sider problems that arise when indefinites occurring
in subordinate clauses are interpreted specifically.2

label of subordinate clauses is set equal to the la-
bel of the antecedent/consequent of the implicati-

UDRS builds an upper-semilattice with one-element
tr. We assume that databases are constructed out of

one-element PT associated with each UDRS repre-
senting a sentence Si is to prevent any quantifier of

4 Rules of Inference
</note>
<bodyText confidence="0.999766105263158">
The four inference rules needed for the fragment wi-
thout generalized quantifiers6 and disjunction are
non-empty universe (NeU), detachment (DET), am-
biguity introduction (Al), and ambiguity eliminati-
on (DIFF). NeU allows to add any finite collection
of discourse referents to a DRS universe. It reflects
the assumption that there is of necessity one thing,
i.e. that we consider only models with non-empty
universes. DET is a generalization of modus ponens.
It allows to add (a variant of) the consequent of an
implication (or the scope of a universally quantified
condition) to the DRS in which the condition occurs
if the antecedent (restrictor) can be mapped to this
DRS. Al allows one to add an ambiguous represen-
tation to the data, if the data already contains all
of its disambiguations. And an application of DIFF
reduces the set of readings of an underspecified re-
presentation in the presence of negations of some
of its readings. The formulations of NeU, DET and
DIFF needed for the consequence relation (8) defi-
ned in Section 2 of this paper are just refinements of
the formulations needed for the consequence relation
(1). As the latter case is extensively discussed in [7]
and a precise and complete formulation of the rules
is also given there we will restrict ourselves to the
refinements needed to adapt these rules to the new
consequence relation.
As there is nothing more to mention about NeU we
start with DET. We first present a formulation of
DET for DRSs. It is an extended formulation of stan-
dard DET as it allows for applications not only at
the top level of a DRS but at levels of any depth.
Correctness of this extension is shown in [4].
DET Suppose a DRS K contains a condition of the
form K1 = K2 such that K1 may be embedded
into K by a function f, where K is the merge of
all the DRSs to which K is subordinate. Then
we may add K&apos;2 to K, where 1c2 results from
K2 by replacing all occurrences of discourse re-
ferents of UK, by new ones and the discourse
referents x declared in U.Ki by f(x).
We will generalize DET to UDRSs such that the
structure that results from an application of DET
to a UDRS is again a UDRS, i.e. directly represents
some natural language sentence. We, therefore, in-
corporate the task of what is usually done by a rule
of thinning into the formulation of DET itself and
also into the following definition of embedding. We
define an embedding f of a UDRS into a UDRS to be
a function that maps labels to labels and discourse
referents to discourse referents while preserving all
conditions in which they occur. We assume that f is
one-to-one when f is restricted to the set of discour-
6We will use implicative conditions of the form
la), to represent universally quantified NPs (in-
stead of their generalized quantifier representation
(every, 11, 12)).

se referents occurring in proper sub-universes. Only
discourse referents occurring in the universe associa-
ted with 1-r- may be identified by f. We do not assume
that the restriction of f to the set of labels is one-
to-one also. But f must preserve =. and V, i.e.
respect the following restrictions.
(i) if /:(/i ,/2) occurs in K&apos;, then f(/):(4/1),f(/2)),
(ii) if occurs in K&apos;, then 40:4(0.
For the formulation of the deduction rules it is con-
venient to introduce the following abbreviation. Let
K be a UDRS and 1 some of its labels. Then ki is
the sub-UDRS of K dominated by /, i.e. K1 contains
all conditions r:7 such that r &lt;1 and its ordering re-
lation is the restriction of K&apos;s ordering relation.
Suppose 7 = /0:4 /2 is the distinguished conditi-
on of a UDRS component 1:K occurring in a UDRS
clause Kt of a UDRS K. And suppose there is an
embedding f of Kil into a set of conditions l&apos;:(5 of K
such that 1 &lt; 1&apos;. Then the result of an application
of DET to 7 is a clause Ks/ that is obtained from
K1 by (i) eliminating K11 from Ki (ii) replacing all
occurrences of discourse referents in the remaining
structure by new ones and the discourse referents x
declared in the universe of /1, by f(x); (iii) substitu-
ting l&apos; for 1, l, and /2 in ORA; and (iv) replacing
all other labels of Ki by new ones.
But note that applications of DET are restricted to
NPs that occur &apos;in the context of&apos; implicative condi-
tions, or monotone increasing quantifiers, as shown
in (16). Suppose we know that John is a politician,
then:
(16)Few problems preoccupy every politician.
If Few problems preoccupy John.
Every politician didn&apos;t sleep.
If John didn&apos;t sleep.
At least one problem preoccupies every pol.
I-- At least one problem preoccupies John.
(16) shows that DET may only be applied to a con-
dition 7 occurring in 1:K, if there is no component
11:10 such that the distinguished condition /1:71 of
K&apos; is either a monotone decreasing quantifier or a
negation, and such that for some disambiguation of
the clause in which 7 occurs we get 1 &lt; scope(1&apos; ).
As the negation of a monotone decreasing quantifier
is monotone increasing and two negations neutralize
each other the easiest way to implement the restric-
tion is to assign polarities to UDRS components and
restrict applications of DET to components with po-
sitive polarity as follows.
Suppose 1:K occurs in a UDRS clause
:(70, 7n), ORD/0), where /0 has positive pola-
rity, written Vol-. Then 1 has positive (negative) pola-
rity if for each disambiguation the cardinality of the
set of monotone decreasing components (i.e. mono-
tone decreasing quantifiers or negations) that takes
wide scope over / is even (odd). Negative polarity
of /0 is induces the complementary distribution of
polarity marking for 1. If 1 is the label of a com-
plex condition, then the polarity of 1 determines the
polarity of the arguments of this condition accor-
ding to the following patterns: ljl, r
and Pr- has positive polarity for every
i. The polarity of the upper bound label of a UDRS-
clause is inherited from the polarity of the label the
UDRS-clause is attached to. Verbs, i.e. lower bounds
of UDRS-clauses, always have definite polarities if
the upper bound label of the same clause has.
Two remarks are in order before we come to the for-
mulation of DET. First, the polarity distribution can
be done without explicitly calculating all disambi-
guations. The label 1 of a component 1:K is positive
(negative) in the clause in which occurs, if the set
of components on the path to the upper bound la-
bel /,1- of this clause contains an even (odd) number
of polarity changing elements, and all other com-
ponents of the clause (i.e. those occurring on other
paths) do not change polarity. Second, the fragment
of UDRSs we are considering in this paper does not
contain a treatment of n-ary quantifiers. Especial-
ly we do not deal with resumptive quantifiers, like
&lt;no boy, no girl&gt; in No boy likes no girl. If we
do not consider the fact that this sentence may be
read as No boy likes any girl the polarity mar-
king defined above will mark the label of the verb as
positive. But if we take this reading into account, i.e.
allow to construe the two quantified NPs as constitu-
ents of the resumptive quantifier, then one negation
is cancelled and the label of the verb cannot get a
definite value.&amp;quot;
To represent DET schematically we
write (1- r:o-(F :7), ORD) to indicate that F :K is a
component of the UDRS KIT with polarity 7r and
distinguished condition 7.

The scheme for DET allows the arguments of the
implicative condition to which it is applied still to be
ambiguous. The discussion of example (6) in Section
2 focussed on the ambiguity of its antecedent only.
(We ignored the ambiguity of the consequent there.)
To discuss the case of ambiguous consequents we
consider the the following argument.
(17)If the chairman talks, everybody doesn&apos;t sleep.
The chairman talks. I- Everybody doesn&apos;t sleep.
There is a crucial difference between (17) and (6):
The truth of the conclusion in (17) depends on the
fact that it is derived from the conditional. It, the-
refore, must be treated as correlated with the conse-
quent of the conditional under any disambiguation.
No non-correlated disambiguations are allowed. To
ensure this we must have some means to represent
&apos;A general treatment of n-ary quantification within
the theory of UDRSs has still to be worked out. In [6] it
is shown how cumulative quantification may be treated
using identification of labels.

the &apos;history&apos; of the clauses that are added to a set of
data. As (8) suggests this could be done by coinde-
xing 1C1,1 and IC f(i,i) in the representation of (17).
In contrast to the obligatory coindexing in the ca-
se of (17) the consequence relation in (8) does allow
for non-correlated interpretations in the case of (2).
Such interpretations naturally occur if, e.g., the con-
ditional and the minor premiss were introduced by
very distinct parts of a text from which the databa-
se had been constructed. In such cases the interpre-
ter may assume that the contexts in which the two
sentences occurred are independent of each other.
He, therefore, leaves leeway for the possibility that
(later on) each context could be provided with more
information in such a way that those interpretations
trigger different disambiguations of the two occur-
rences. In such cases &amp;quot;crossed interpretations&amp;quot; must
be allowed, and any application of DET must be
refused by contraindexing - except the crossed in-
terpretations can be shown to be equivalent. For the
sake of readability we present the rule only for the
propositional case.
A a, [33 ak i = k V (i OkAA I- a, &lt;=&gt; ak)

But the interpreter could also adopt the strategy to
accept the argument also in case of non-correlated
interpretations without checking the validity of a, &lt;=&gt;
ak. In this case he will conclude that Oi holds un-
der the proviso that he might revise this inference
if there will be additional information that forces
him to disambiguate in a non-correlated way. If then
a, &lt;#. ak does not hold he must be able to give up
the conclusion 03 and every other argument that
was based on it. To accomodate this strategy we
need more than just coindexing. We need means to
represent the structure of whole proofs. As we ha-
ve labels available in our language we may do this
by adopting the techniques of labelled deductive sy-
stems ([3]). For reasons of space we will not go into
this in further detail.
The next inference rule, Al, allows one to introduce
ambiguities. It contrasts with the standard rule of
disjunction introduction in that it allows for the in-
troduction of a UDRS a that is underspecified with
respect to the two readings al and a2 only if both,
al and a2, are contained in the data. This shows
once more that ambiguities are not treated as dis-
junctions.
Ambiguitiy Introduction Let al and a2 be two
UDRSs of A that differ only w.r.t. their ORDs.
Then we may add a UDRS a3 to A that is like
al but has the intersection of ORD and ORD&apos;
as ordering of its labels. The index of a3 is new
to A.
We give an example to show how Al and DET inter-
act in the case of non-correlated readings: Suppose
the data A consists of o-1, az and 0-3 = &apos;T. We want
to derive 7. We apply Al to al and a2 and add a3 to
A. As the index of a3 is new we must check whether
&lt;=&gt; a2 can be derived from A. Because A contains
both of them the proof succeeds.
The last rule of inference, DIFF, eliminates ambi-
guities on the basis of structural differences in the
ordering relations. Suppose ai and a2 are a under-
specified representations with three scope bearing
components /1, /2, and /3. Assume further that al
has readings that correspond to the following orders
of these components: (13, /2, 11), (12, 13, 11), and (12,
/1, /3), whereas a2 is ambiguous between (12, /3, /1)
and (/2, l, /3). Suppose now that the data contains
al and the negation of a2. Then this set of data
is equivalent_to the reading given by (13, /2, /1). To
see that this holds the structural difference between
the structures ORDai and ORD,,2 has to be calcu-
lated. The structural difference between two struc-
tures ORD,„ and ORD„2 is the partial order that
satisfies ORD„„ but not ORDa, , if there is any; and
it is falsity if there is no such order. Thus the noti-
on of structural difference generalizes the traditional
notion of inconsistency. Again a precise formulation
of DIFF is given in [7].

Rules of proof are deduction rules that allow us to
reduce the complexity of the goal by accomplishing
subproof. We will consider COND(itionalization)
and R(eductio)A(d)A(bsurdum) and show that they
may not be applied in the case of ambiguous goals
(i.e. goals in which no operator has widest scope).
Suppose we want to derive everybody didn&apos;t sno-
re from everybody didn&apos;t sleep and the fact
that snoring implies sleeping. I.e. we want to car-
ry out the proof in (18), where ORD = {/3 &lt;

Let us try to apply rules of proof to reduce the com-

sen, i.e. COND before RAA, results in having given
the universal quantifier wide scope over the negati-
on. This means that after having applied COND we
are not in the process of proving the original ambi-
guous goal any more. What we are going to prove
instead is that reading of the goal with universal
quantifier having wide scope over the negation. Be-
ginning with RAA instead of COND assigns the ne-
gation wide scope over the quantifier, as we would

data in order to derive a contradiction.&apos; Here ORD&amp;quot;
results from ORD&apos; by replacing 17 and scope(17) with

If we tried to keep the reduction-of-the-goal strategy
we would have to perform the disambiguation steps
to formulas in the data that the order of applica-
tion on COND and RAA triggers. And in addition
we would have to check all possible orders, not only
one. Hence we would perform exactly the same set of
proofs that would be needed if we represented ambi-
guous sentences by sets of formulas. Nothing would
have been gained with respect to any traditional ap-
proach.
We thus conclude that applications of COND and
RAA are only possible if either = or has wide
scope in the goal. In this case standard formulati-
ons of COND and RAA may be applied even if the
goal is ambiguous at some lower level of structure.
In case the underspecification occurs with respect
to the relative scope of immediate daughters of /-r-,
however, we must find some other means to rela-
te non-identical UDRSs in goal and data. What we
need are rules for UDRSs that generalize the success
case for atoms within ordinary deduction systems.

The inference in (18) can be realised very easily if
we allow components of UDRSs that are marked ne-
gative to be replaced by components with a smal-
ler denotation. Likewise components of UDRSs that
are marked positive may be replaced by components
with a larger denotation. If the component to be re-
placed is the restrictor of a generalized quantifier,
then in addition to the polarity marking the sound-
ness of such substitutions depends on the persist-
ence property of the quantifier. In the framework
of UDRSs persistence of quantifiers has to be defi-
ned relative to the context in which they occur. Let
Nlpt be a persistent (anti-persistent) NP. Then NPi
is called persistent (anti-persistent) in clause S, if

in (1), then this disambiguation could be compensated
for by applying RESTART (see [7J for details). But re-
lative to the consequence relation under (8) RESTART
is not sound!
this property is preserved under each disambiguati-
on of S. So everybody is anti-persistent in (19e),
but not in (19a), because the wide scope reading for
the negation blocks the inference in (19b). It is not
persistent in (19c) nor in (19d).

scope bearing elements may end up between the in-
definite and the universal in some disambiguation
the rule may only be applied, if these elements be-

Perspectives

<bodyText confidence="0.999988961538462">
The paper has shown that it is possible to reason
with ambiguities in a natural, direct and intuitively
correct way.
The fact that humans are able to reason with am-
biguities led to a natural distinction between deduc-
tion systems that apply rules of proof to reduce the
complexity of a goal and systems of logic that are
tailored directly for natural language interpretati-
on and reasoning. Human interpreters seem to use
both systems when they perform reasoning tasks.
We know that we cannot surmount undecidability
(in a non-adhoc way) if we take quantifiers and/or
connectives as logical devices in the traditional sen-
se. But as the deduction rules for top-level ambi-
guities given here present an extension of Aristoteli-
an syllogism metamathematical results about their
complexity will be of great interest as well as the
proof of a completeness theorem. Apart from this re-
search the use of the rule system within the task of
natural language understanding is under investiga-
tion. It seems that the Replacement Rules are par-
ticularly suited to do special reasoning tasks nec-
cessary to disambiguate lexical ambiguities, because
most of the deductive processes needed there are in-
dependent of any quantificational structure of the
sentences containing the ambiguous item.

It is an extended formulation of standard DET as it allows for applications not only at the top level of a DRS but at levels of any depth. Correctness of this extension is shown in [4]. DET Suppose a DRS K contains a condition of the form K1 = K2 such that K1 may be embedded into K by a function f, where K is the merge of all the DRSs to which K is subordinate. Then we may add K&apos;2 to K, where 1c2 results from K2 by replacing all occurrences of discourse referents of UK, by new ones and the discourse referents x declared in U.Ki by f(x). We will generalize DET to UDRSs such that the structure that results from an application of DET to a UDRS is again a UDRS, i.e. directly represents some natural language sentence. We, therefore, incorporate the task of what is usually done b</context>

(B might after all have had in mind just that reading of the sentence that is not part of R&apos;s knowledge.) must be ordered isomorphically. On the other hand two sentences may carry an ambiguity of the same type if one results from the other by applying Detachment to a universally quantified NP (see Section 4). 2 We will distinguish between these two situations by requiring the provability relation to respect indices. The rule of direct proof will then be an instance of Reflexivity: r if 7, E F. 3 A short introduction to UDRSs The base for unscoped representations proposed in [7] is the separation of information about the structure of a particular semantic form and of the content of the information bits the semantic form combines. In case the semantic form is given by a DRS its structure is given by the hierarchy of subDRSs, that is determined by V and 0. We will represent this hierarchy explicitly by the subordination relation &lt;. The semantic content of a DRS consists of the set of its discourse referents and its conditions. To be more precise, we express the structural information by a language with one predicate &lt; that relates individual constants 1, called labels.</context>

Al allows one to add an ambiguous representation to the data, if the data already contains all of its disambiguations. And an application of DIFF reduces the set of readings of an underspecified representation in the presence of negations of some of its readings. The formulations of NeU, DET and DIFF needed for the consequence relation (8) defined in Section 2 of this paper are just refinements of the formulations needed for the consequence relation (1). As the latter case is extensively discussed in [7] and a precise and complete formulation of the rules is also given there we will restrict ourselves to the refinements needed to adapt these rules to the new consequence relation. As there is nothing more to mention about NeU we start with DET. We first present a formulation of DET for DRSs.

The structural difference between two structures ORD,„ and ORD„2 is the partial order that satisfies ORD„„ but not ORDa, , if there is any; and it is falsity if there is no such order. Thus the notion of structural difference generalizes the traditional notion of inconsistency. Again a precise formulation of DIFF is given in [7]. 5 Rules of Proof Rules of proof are deduction rules that allow us to reduce the complexity of the goal by accomplishing subproof. We will consider COND(itionalization) and R(eductio)A(d)A(bsurdum) and show that they may not be applied in the case of ambiguous goals (i.e. goals in which no operator has widest scope). Suppose we want to derive everybody didn&apos;t snore from everybody didn&apos;t sleep and the fact that snoring implies sleeping.
