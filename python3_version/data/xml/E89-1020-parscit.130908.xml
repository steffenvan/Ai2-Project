ABSTRACT
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9996394">
The paper proposes a paradigmatic approach to
morphological knowledge acquisition. It ad-
dresses the problem of learning from examples
rules for word-forms analysis and synthesis.
These rules, established by generalizing the train-
ing data sets, are effectively used by a built-in in-
terpreter which acts consequently as a
morphological processor within the architecture
of a natural language question-answering system.
The PARADIGM system has no a priori knowledge
which should restrict it to a particular natural lan-
guage, but Instead builds up the morphological
rules based only on the examples provided, be
they in Romanian, English, French, Russian, Slo-
vak and the like.

1. INTRODUCTION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998356923077">
For highly inflexional languages, encoding all
word forms into a word lexicon (declarative mor-
phology approach) appears to be a poor solution
not only due to a great redundancy (which for
some languages is prohibitive (Jappinen,1983))
but also with respect to some theoretical aspects
(as for instance descriptional adequacy
(Wehr11,1985)).
Within an Inflexional morphology environment
(Alshaw1,1985), we propose a procedural ap-
proach based on automatically acquired flexio-
ning paradigms. The paradigmatic model is
incorporated into an experimental system called
PARADIGM, which is intended to (partially) re-
place the acquisition and modelling part of our
MORPHO lexicon management system
(Tufis,1987a) incorporated by the IURES environ-
ment for building natural language applications
(Tufis,1985).
The aim of our work is twofold: to obtain a sound
linguistic tool for word-forms analysis and syn-
thesis (which In case of highly inflexional lan-
guages is by no means a trivial task) and to
provide for a psychologically motivated behaviour
of such a system in dealing with unknown words.
In the following, we shall dwell on the technical Is-
sues connected to the first of the above two men-
tioned motivations. With respect to the second
one maybe it is worth saying that when PARA-
DIGM lacks appropriate or complete knowledge It
Is supposed to act the same way a child or a
foreign speak partner does. That is, for Instance,
to say &amp;quot;goed&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;womans&amp;quot; If the corresponding ir-
regularity Is unknown. The reason for such a de-
cision stems mainly from our attempt to study in
parallel with the implementation, the effectiveness
of language learning based on informal examples.
From the linguistic engineering point of view, the
purpose of the system is stated very pragmati-
cally, that is to ease and speed up as much as
possible the building of language specific mor-
phological knowledge bases without (too much)
help from theoretical morphologists, experts on
the language concerned. It is not always easy to
find appropriate written material, not to speak
about human experts, presenting in a rigorous
manner (as imposed by computer applications)
the rules and peculiarities of word structuring in
different languages.
PARADIGM was conceived to overcome, at least
partially, these difficulties and to provide a handy
tool for immediate verification of specific rules va-
lidity. As the general situation is with learning sys-
tems, different copies of PARADIGM may be used
in parallel and finally merge the individually de-
veloped knowledge bases. This is beneficialy not
only with respect to the development time but also
with respect to the linguistic coverage.
Architecturally, PARADIGM was influenced by
DISCIPLE (Tecuci, 1988) in the sense that the be-
havioral dichotomy &amp;quot;apprentice-expert&amp;quot; was Incor-
porated into its implementation. However, due to
the more specific task, the technical solutions
adopted in PARADIGM for knowledge acquisition
are different, being problem oriented.

2. DEFINITIONS
2.1 MORPHOLOGICAL MODEL
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.976884166666667">
We call a morphological model the tuple:
MM (C,SC,M,V,F1,F2,F3,P) where C is a set of
categories: C = Ici SC is a set of sub-ca-
tegories of the categories In C: SC= (sci,...,scil;
- 145 -
M is a set of features of the sub-categories in SC:
M = {m,...,mk}; Visa set of values which features
can take: V= {vi, ...,vm}; Fl is a function defined
on C, taking values in the power set of SC:
Fl: C---&gt; PS(SC); F2 is a function defined on SC,
taking values in the power set of M:
F2: SC--- &gt; PS(M); F3 is a function defined on M,
taking values in the power set of V: F3:
M--- &gt; PS(V); P is a subset of the Cartesian pro-
duct C x SC x P(M) x P(V) so that Vpi = (ci,sci,Mi,V1)
e P the following are true: cie C &amp; scie SC &amp; MiC M

Mi = {mil,...,mik} &amp; Vi={Vil,..., VIk} &amp; VCIe[1,k1
Viqe F3(miq). P is called the paradigmatic flexio-
ning space of the morphological model MM. For
Instance a point of P in a certain MM might be:
(noun common-noun
(gender number case articulation)
(masculine plural genitive definite))

2.2. THEMATIC FAMILIES
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9970604">
We call a thematic family (TF) the set of all word-
forms of a given (lemma) word, obtained by gram-
matical Inflecting: TF = {Wi,...,Wm}. Let us
consider a TF to be always lexicographically
sorted. Let &lt; X &gt; denote an arbitrary string of
characters and &lt; X &gt; &lt; Y &gt; the string obtained by
concatenating the substrings &lt; X &gt; and &lt;V &gt; .
We say that a TF is regular iff there is a q-letter
substring &lt; Rq &gt; called root, common to all the m
words of TF so that:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.661369166666667">
la)Vi&lt; Wi&gt; ETF, &lt;Wi &gt; &lt; Rq &gt; &lt;ei &gt;
1 b) &lt; Rq &gt; is the longest substring with the
property la)
1c) q &gt; = low-limit (an integer varying from lan-
guage to language)
id) Vie [2,m-1] the subsets {&lt;Wi &gt; ..... &lt; &gt;1
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9844797">
and { &lt;W1+1&gt;,...,&lt;Wm&gt;1 give the roots
&lt; Rql &gt; and &lt; Rq2 &gt; with &lt; Rqi &gt; being a sub-
string of &lt; Rq2 &gt; or at most equal to &lt; Rq2 &gt; .
The remaining part of a word in TF after remov-
ing the root is called an ending (we use the term
&apos;ending to include both desinences and suffixes).
The list of all endings obtained from a TF is called
a paradigmatic endings family (PEF).
A thematic family Is called partial regular if there
is a partition of TF = {TF1,TF2,...,TFk} so that:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.5469365">
2a) UTFI=TF &amp; j) TFI n TF1= 0
2b) Vi (TFi is regular &amp; CARD(TF1) &gt;1).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999831176470588">
According to the above definition, a partial-regu-
lar TF will be characterized by k roots. A thematic
family which is neither regular nor partial-regular
is called irregular.
In the following, in order to simplify notations,
when referring to strings of characters, we use an-
gular brackets only If we need to outline a compo-
sition/decomposition of a word-form.
A central notion of our approach Is that of flex-
ionIng paradigm. Its meaning Is similar to that
used by most of the morphologists.
We define a flexioning paradigm 0 as a list of
pairs: 0 = {(ei pi)(e2 p2)...(ek pk)} where &apos;ei&apos; are
endings extracted from a thematic family (Irre-
spective of their regularity) and &apos;pi&apos; are appropri-
ate points in P (the appropriateness will be
revealed in the fourth chapter).

2.3 UNINTERPRETED LEXICON
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99985272">
Let LS be a set of words obtained from the union
of K thematic families, called a lexical stock:
LS =TF1 uTF2L). . .uTFk. We call an uninter-
preted lexicon of the word stock LS a set
UL = {Ri,R2,...,Rp} so that for any le (1,p) Ri is a
root of a certain TFi in LS. The mapping
I: LS --- &gt; PS(UL x P) is called an interpretation of
an UL within a morphological model MM (recall
that P is a paradigmatic flexioning space of a cer-
tain MM). Let us observe that I mapping allows a
word to be ambiguously interpreted, which is
quite natural at the level of Isolated word-form ana-
lysis. Such a common ambiguity, for instance, Is
figured out by the Romanian word &amp;quot;modul&amp;quot;, which
may stand either for the unarticulated nomina-
tive/accusative form of &amp;quot;modul&amp;quot; (module) or for the
articulated nominative/accusative form of &amp;quot;mod&amp;quot;
(mode, manner). The I mapping abstracts the pro-
cess of word-forms analysis. The abstraction of
the reverse process, the generation of word-
forms, is represented by the mapping G defined
as follows: G: ULxP &gt; LS. As opposed to I, G is
a univoque function, that is for a given root and a
specific point in the paradigmatic flexioning point
P. a unique word-form will result.

3. BUILDING A MORPHOLOGICAL MODEL
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.990990425531915">
To build a morphological model the designer
starts by specifiying the categories of interest In
his/her application. The traditional categories are
NOUN, ADJECTIVE, VERB, PRONOUN and so
forth, but by no means this categorial system Is
- 146 -
obligatory (for instance one might think of using
semantically flavoured categories such as OB-
JECT, PROPERTY, ACTION, STATE, ANAPHOR
etc).
For each defined category In C, the designer will
be asked to provide the desired sub-categories
(for instance COMMON-NOUN and PROPER-
NOUN for NOUN). This activity is equivalent in the
formal model to defining the SC subset and the Fl
function. Further, for each sub-category in SC the
system asks the designer to enter the specific fea-
tures along which the inflexional behaviour of the
words gets relevant. With Romanian language for
instance, while number, case and enclitic articu-
lation are relevant for COMMON-NOUN, for fe-
minine PROPER-NOUN only the case is
significant (but this is not always true: the feminine
proper-nouns ending in a consonant, whatever
their etimology, do not fiexate at all). By entering
all sub-category-features associations, the system
is implicitly provided with the M set and F2 func-
tion. Finally, for each feature in M, the designer
will be asked to define the possible values the cur-
rent feature may take (e.g. &apos;singular&apos; and &apos;plural&apos;
for the &apos;number&apos; feature). When the list of features
Is exhausted, the system has already learnt the V
set and F3 mapping. At this point, the activity of
the designer Is theoretically finished and it is the
system Itself which will generate, based on these
definitions, the paradigmatic flexioning space (P),
thus accomplishing the MM internal repre-
sentation. From this internal representation, the
system generates for each defined sub-category
a graphic tabular menu (we call It an Acquisition
Scenario AS) partially filled In. The only blank col-
umn in an AS is called WORD-FORM column and
is accessible for writing in by the trainer (tutor) of
the system. Each line in an AS is filled (except the
last field corresponding to the WORD-FORM col-
umn) by the information uniquely identifying a
point in P.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.99251" genericHeader="method">
4. KNOWLEDGE ACQUISITION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992615671755726">
When the tutor chooses a defined sub-category
of a category In C to be exemplified, the system
answers by displaying the associated acquisition
scenario. What the tutor is asked to do Is to fill in
the blanks the WORD-FORM column with the in-
flected forms of the thematic word. Each word
form must obey the restrictions imposed by the
combination of the feature values displayed on the
line which the tutor Is writing in.
Once the WORD-FORM column of the current
AS completely filled in, the root detection phase is
activated. The word-forms are ordered lexico-
graphically with the provision that the initial asso-
ciation: ((ci sci MI VI) WI) will be remembered. In
the general case of a partially regular TF contain-
ing n word-forms the result of the root detection
phase is represented as follows:
LA = Wel...ek)roott)...((em...0n) root)).
The n endings in the above list inherit the mor-
phological features which are associated with the
word forms which they were extracted from. That
Is If the word Wi root + ei was associated with
= (ci scj Mj Vi) then ei would also be associated
with pi. As a result, a possible new flexIoning para-
digm appears: 0 = ((et pi)(e2 p2).. (en pn)). While
p are all distinct, this Is not obligatory the case for
the endings. The 0 paradigm is looked for in a list
of already known paradigms and if not found
there, is marked for interning. To interne a para-
digm means to integrate it into an associative
structure (a discrimination tree) appropriate for
word-form morphological analysis (see further).
With the generation of word forms, the above rep-
resentation is very suitable (Tufis,1988). A para-
digm is interned Immediately after its marking only
if it was learnt from a regular TF. Otherwise, this
process is delayed until the roots of the TF are pro-
cessed. The discrimination tree internally repre-
sents all the known endings and their
morphological feature values. Its nodes are la-
belled with letters appearing in different endings.
A proper ending is represented by the concaten-
ation of the letters labelling the nodes along a cer-
tain path, starting from a terminal node towards
the root of the tree. Due to the retrograde strate-
gy used in our system, possible endings which are
searched for In a word from right to the left, are
checked in the discrimination tree from top to bot-
tom. This explains the ordering of the label letters
in the tree. A terminal node (T-node) Is not obliga-
tory a leaf node because of the possibility of inclu-
sion of one ending into a longer one (the reverse
Is always true). All T-nodes are associated with the
paradigmatic information specific to the ending
which they stand for. This iliformation is repre-
sented by a list of pairs: ((Qi pi)(Q2 p2).. .(0m pm))
where Qi are paradigm identifiers and p are
(identifiers for) points In the paradigmatic flexio-
ning space P. If a 1-node (hence an ending) has
associated more than a single pair (0 p) it is called
extrinsically ambiguous. Another type of ambi-
guity is induced by the endings containing shor-
ter embedded endings. We call such endings
Intrinsically ambiguous. Let us suppose two en-
dings &lt; X &gt; and &lt; Y &gt; so that &lt; X &gt; may be writ-
ten as &lt; Z &gt; &lt; Y &gt; . In case of a word-form
&lt; A &gt; &lt; Z &gt; &lt;V&gt; without additional Information
one cannot definitely decide If the word should be
- 147 -
segmented as &lt;A&gt; &lt;Z&gt; + &lt;Y&gt; or as
&lt; A &gt; + &lt; Z &gt; &lt; &gt; . For both types of ambi-
guities there are sound methods of resolution If
the decision procedure has access to the root lex-
icon or to some syntactic rules.
Anyway, for intrinsically ambiguous cases, our
system has found out that for Romanian, In almost
all cases the segmentation with the longest ending
is the correct one. For extrinsically ambiguous en-
dings, the system uses some statistics, extracted
from the training data, which proved to be valu-
able. For instance, the system updates for each
paradigm, a so-called local counter with each new
thematic family behaving according to that para-
digm. The value of this counter, specific for each
paradigm is considered In sorting the interpreta-
tions of an ending :((01 pr)). According
to this sorting, an interpretation p) is con-
sidered more likely than another one (0i p), if in
the lexicon there are more roots &amp;quot;belonging&amp;quot; to Qi
than to O. This preference heuristics does not
take into account the frequency of the words in
running texts but only their paradigmatic classifi-
cation. We plan to introduce the &amp;quot;dynamic
counters&apos;. which are supposed to provide qualita-
tive estimation based on word-forms frequences.
It is clear that in order to provide valuable pref-
erences, the values of the static/dynamic counters
must result from large sets of examples and run-
ning texts. This requirement may be fulfilled by
using In parallel many PARADIGM incarnations
and finally by merging their outputs. It is import-
ant to note that the.preference kieuristics we talk
about are intended only for getting a plausability
ordering criterion for the possible interpretations
of an ending or segmentations of an word-form. It
means that no interpretation variant is rejected at
this level, so that if a preferred (according to the
preference heuristics) interpretation or segmenta-
tion was wrong, the correct one may still be found.
Roots processing and eventually paradigms
modification or absorbtion (see further) are based
on some similarity criteria. If no similarity is de-
tected between the roots of a TF, the correspond-
ing paradigm, if marked as new, Is interned as it
was initially constructed. But if the roots are simi-
lar, the system tries to reduce differences between
them, either by modifying the inflexional paradigm
or by Inferring rules for root modification. The first
approach is generally taken if the differences be-
tween roots appear at their boundary with the en-
dings. The second method Is usually tried In case
of differences appearing inside the roots. The simi-
larity criteria are declaratively specified, so that it
Is easy to modify, augment or adapt them to spe-
cific needs. The notion of similarity, as used in our
approach, is very simple. We have developed a
similarity description language in which one may
describe the conditions under which two strings
are to be considered similar. With the current ver-
sion of the system, we use only three simple simi-
larity rules:
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.525538333333333">
81) &lt;X&gt;?&lt;Y&gt; &lt;X&gt; &lt;y&gt;
&lt;X&gt;I a &lt;X&gt;?
s3) &lt;X&gt;?&lt;Y&gt;I &lt;X&gt;?&lt;Y&gt;?
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.97345893125">
In the above rules the metasymbol &lt; X &gt; stands
for an arbitrary string, the question mark for zero
or one letter, the exclamation mark for exactly one
letter and EN for the similarity relation. Their read-
ings are:
rs1) two strings are similar if they differ by at
most one embedded letter (calculatoAr a calcu-
lator);
rs2) two strings are similar if they are the same
except the last letter of one or both of them (copiL
a copil);
rs3) two strings are similar If they differ by at
most one embedded letter and by the last letter of
one or both of them (fereAstrA a ferestrE).
Actually, the similarity description language is
more powerful than it is suggested. For instance,
one may impose restrictions on an &lt; X &gt; con-
struction such as minimal or exact number of
characters in X, prosodic restrictions such as
presence or absence of accent, a.s.o . If two roots
are similar, the system attempts to generalize their
similarity beyond the particular IF currently pro-
cessed. The similarity between two roots is
necessary but not sufficient for making a generali-
zation. What is needed, is an explanation, In terms
of morphological features, accounting for root
modification. This explanation, if found, will be
used as a precondition for the root modification
rule to be synthesized. The explanation justifies
the difference between the two roots (of the same
TF), and consists of discriminant descriptions (In
terms of morphological features) of the endings
associated with them. In the current version of the
system, It looks for the morphological features
which have the same value for all the word-forms
obtainable from the first root and another different
value for all word-forms derived from the second
root. For instance with the similar roots &apos;copir and
&apos;copil. (child), the system discovered that all the
forms In singular are produced by the first root
while the second generates all the plural forms.
- 148 -
Using this fact, the system built the following rule,
entering only one root (copil) in the lexicon:
&amp;quot;If a root X behaves according to the paradigm
039 and its last letter is &apos;I&apos; then in all plural forms
&apos;I&apos; must be replaced by the letterl&apos;.
The &amp;quot;generative&amp;quot; flavour of this rule should not
be misleading: that is, one must not infer that it is
good only for generation. The same rule applies
to analysis:
&amp;quot;If a root was discovered according to the para-
digm 039 and Its last letter was &apos;I&apos;, the root may
be recorded in the lexicon with its &apos;I&apos; replaced by
the letter &apos;I&amp;quot;.
As more data sets are provided the rules may
be generalized further in order to cover the new
cases.
We said before that the internalization of a
marked paradigm was delayed until the roots of a
partial TF were processed. As we shall see in the
example below, the delay is justified by the possi-
bility to alter the initial endings (hence the para-
digm) in order to minimize the differences
between the considered roots. A paradigm modi-
fication may appear if the last letter from each of
the roots taken into account is transferred in front
of all their corresponding endings (recall the LA
list in the beginning of this chapter). If the system
finds no feature-based justification for root modi-
fication and if the difference between the roots is
given by their last letters, It decides to transfer
these laulty&amp;quot; letters into the appropriate endings,
thus &amp;quot;regularizing&amp;quot; the TF. As a side-effect the in-
itial paradigm is modified and in case the new one
is already known the decision is considered sound
and the older paradigm is forgotten. If the new
paradigm is not known to the system then both
paradigms (the initial and the modified ones) are
kept until further evidence will allow the system to
choose among them. If no such evidence is ob-
tained In favour of one or another paradigm, it will
be the task of the knowledge base designer to de-
cide on the matter.
Let us follow on an example the process of learn-
ing a root modification rule. Consider that the
trainer provided the thematic family for the the-
matic word &amp;quot;fereastra&amp;quot; (window). The root detec-
tion process will generate the following
segmentations:
fereastra + 0 (0 stands for the null ending)
fereastra + 0
ferestre + I
ferestre + 0
ferestre + le
ferestre + 0
ferestre + lor
ferestre + 0
There are identified two roots: &apos;fereastra&apos; and
&apos;ferestre&apos;. According to the rule 83) they are simi-
lar, with &lt; X &gt; and &lt;V&gt; bound to &apos;fere&apos; and &apos;str&apos;
respectively. The fault letters are associated with
their appearance context: &gt;elai s&lt; , &gt;rial and
&gt;riei. The notations are interpreted as follows:
&amp;quot; &gt; e&amp;quot; = = an &apos;e&apos; preceded by some other letters;
&apos;Ial&amp;quot; — the &apos;a&apos; fault letter;
&amp;quot;s&lt;&amp;quot; = = an &apos;s&apos; followed by some other letters;
&amp;quot;&gt;rial&amp;quot; = = the final &apos;a&apos; preceded by &apos;r&apos;;
= the final &apos;e&apos; preceded by &apos;r&apos;.
The first decision made in order to minimize the
differences between the two roots Is to transfer the
last character of them into endings, thus resulting
the segmentations:
fereastr + a
fereastr + a
ferestr + ei
ferestr + e
ferestr + ale
ferestr + e
ferestr + eior
ferestr + e
A second step towards difference ellimination is
to consider the deletion of the &apos;a&apos; letter between
&lt;fere &gt; and &lt; str &gt; . But because this operation
does not contribute to paradigm modification it
must be generalized (If possible) as a rule for root
modification. By inspecting the morphological
features of the word-forms, the system finds out
that the root &apos;fereastr&apos; Is characterized by the fea-
ture values: feminine, singular and nom-acc, while
the root &apos;ferestr&apos; is characterized In all its appear-
ances only by the &apos;feminine&apos; feature. Because &apos;fe-
minine&apos; value is common to all word-forms of the
thematic family, it Is considered irrelevant with re-
spect to root modification. Moreover, no word-
- 149 -
form derivable from the lerestr. root has attached
the &amp;quot;singular + nom-acc&amp;quot; feature values combina-
tion. Therefore, this is taken as a possible condi-
tion for the faulty letter deletion and the
synthesized rule is the following:
RM111){&lt;X&gt; = &gt;elais&lt;6, PARA-
DIGM = &apos;PO0007&apos; &amp; NUMBER = &apos;singular&apos; &amp;
CASE = &apos;nom-acc&apos;} = = &gt; — [NUMBER = &apos;sin-
gular&apos; &amp; CASE = &apos;nom-acc&apos;l = = »es&lt; 1
The reading of this rule is: &amp;quot;If a root of a word-
form which flexions according to the P00007 para-
digm, in singular and nom-acc, contains the
embedded string &amp;quot;eas&amp;quot;, then for all combinations
of morphological features not containing both sin-
gular and nom-acc values, the &apos;eas&apos; string is re-
placed by &apos;es&apos;&amp;quot;.
Let us notice that the rule is more specific than
it should be, imposing that all eligible words be-
have according to the P00007 paradigm and re-
quiring the letter &apos;s&apos; to follow the diphtong &apos;ea&apos;. But
the system cannot Infer more from this single
example. If provided with another example, let&apos;s
say &apos;ceapa&apos; (onion), with a similar behaviour the
system synthesizes a rule very alike to RMR1:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.51238675">
RMR2){&lt;X&gt; = &gt;eialp&lt;&amp; PARA-
DIGM =1300007&apos; &amp; NUMBER = &apos;singular&apos; &amp;
CASE = &apos;nom-acc&apos;} = = &gt; (NUMBER = &apos;sin-
gular&apos; &amp; CASE = &apos;nom-acc&apos;) = = »ep&lt; 1
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.951932357142857">
The only difference between RMR1 and RMR2
is the condition that the diphtong &apos;ea&apos; must be fol-
lowed by &apos;s&apos; and &apos;p&apos; respectively. By considering
this condition a particular one, the system drops
it and obtains a more general rule subsuming both
previous ones:
RMR3){&lt;X&gt; &gt;alai &lt;&amp; PARA-

The rule RMR3 is still too specific. The process-
ing of the thematic family for the word &apos;seara&apos; (eve-
ning) produces a further generalization of RMR3.
Firstly, the system generates the following rule:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.815869">
RMR4){ &lt;X &gt; = &gt;cal &lt; &amp; PARA-
DIGM = &apos;PO0008&apos; &amp; NUMBER = &apos;singular&apos; &amp;
CASE = &apos;nom-acc&apos;} = = &gt; — [NUMBER = &apos;sin-
gular&apos; &amp; CASE = &apos;nom-accl = = »e&lt; 1
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999967777777778">
The difference between RMR3 and RMR4 is
made by the restriction that the flexioning para-
digms are required to be P00007 instead of
P00008. To generalize these rules, the system in-
vestigates the feature values of the two involved
paradigms. Their common properties are
SC =COMMON-NOUN, GENDER = FEMININE,
so the system is able to propose a new rule sub-
suming the RMR3 and RMR4 rules:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.6107406">
RMR5){&lt;X&gt; = &gt;0l a I &lt; &amp;SUB-CA-
TEGORY = &apos;common-noun&apos; &amp; GENDER = &apos;fe-
minine&apos; &amp; NUMBER = &apos;singular&apos; &amp;
CASE = &apos;nom-acc&apos;} = = &gt; — [NUMBER = &apos;sin-
gular&apos; &amp; CASE = &apos;nom-acel = =&gt; &gt; es&lt; }
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.997858911392405">
Because generalization correctness over incom-
plete data cannot be guaranteed, each syn-
thesized rule has two associated lists, one of them
containing positive examples (Initially only the
prototype root which generated the rule) and the
other one containing exceptions (initially empty).
A similar point of view, that is attaching exception
lists to general rules, may be found in (Bear,1988).
The roots are entered into the root lexicon. For
partial regular thematic families, the two or more
roots are linked together bidirectIonally. The first
of them, in lexicographic order, is attached to the
relevant common morpho-lexical information:
paradigm name and the label for the semantic de-
scription. This information is Inherited by all linked
roots. There is also root specific morphological in-
formation such as seiectional restrictions and
phonemic patterns. The selectional restrictions
are contributed by the system and they refer to
the constraints to be satisfied in order that a root
be selected in a word-form generation. For the
regular modifying roots, links to the rules they
obey and the position(s) in the root where letter
insertion or deletion is to be performed are also
recorded in this field.
The lexicon building side-effect of the tutorial
sessions is not the main Interest of the research
reported here (for this purpose we developed the
MORPHO lexicon management system
(Tufis,1987a)).This feature was implemented only
for testing the PARADIGM system in learning and
using learnt knowledge. Also, we were interested
in experimenting some generation strategies at
the level of morphology (for instance choosing the
least ambiguous or the more common used root
from a synonimy set - see (Tufis,1988)). It was
possible, in this way, to test the functionality of
PARADIGM without coupling it to MORPHO, oper-
ation which would have required a greater pro-
gramming effort. The embedding of PARADIGM
Into MORPHO is planned for the immediate future.

At the end of the system&apos;s apprenticeship is ac-
tivated a processing phase which we call the para-
digmatic absorbtion. A paradigm 01 may be
absorbed into another paradigm 02 it
ab1) they describe the same subcategory,
ab2) for each ending &apos;ell&apos; from Qi and the corre-
sponding ending &apos;82I&apos; from 02 the following are
true:
&apos;ell&apos; is a suffix of &apos;e2C: &lt; e2i &gt; = &lt; x &gt; &lt; ell &gt; and
the &lt; x &gt; prefflx In &apos;82i&apos; exists as a suffix in all the
roots In the lexicon which, from the flexioning
point of view, behave according to 01.
The Implementation of paradigms absorbtion is
computationally motivated: firstly by decreasing
the number of paradigms, the search space Is nar-
rowed and consequently word-form processing
time improved; secondly, by lengthening the en-
dings, they become more discriminating and
therefore the ambiguity is reduced. In Romanian
the case is that the longer an ending, the less am-
biguous its interpretation. For instance the &apos;I&apos; en-
ding has 19 possible interpretations (In our
model), while the ending &apos;ulur has only one. We
think that this is a general property with inflexio-
nal languages and therefore we consider paradig-
matic absorbtion not to be specific for Romanian.
The paradigmatic absorbtion limits both types
of ambiguity discussed earlier: intrinsically (due
to different possibilities of a word segmentation)
and extrinsically (due to different interpretations
an ending may have).
In order to obtain a complete morphological
knowledge in a relatively short time, PARADIGM
is accompanied by a merging utility program,
(partially) able to unify two or more knowledge
bases developed with different copies of the sys-
tem.

5. FINAL REMARKS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996071117647059">
One of our earlier goals, some years ago, was
to establish, by manual procedures, a reasonable
set of fiexioning paradigms for Romanian, in order
to implement a reliable morphological processor,
general enough to cover the requirements of tech-
nical texts. The task was taken by seven col-
leagues with different backgrounds (linguists,
logicians, engineers and mathematicians ) and
lasted for almost half an year (Cristea,1982). I
used the examples from the then written material,
in order to test the PARADIGM system. While dif-
ferently organized, the equivalent (In linguistic
coverage) knowledge base was obtained in a four-
hour session. Moreover, the number of paradigms
discovered by PARADIGM was smaller (97 para-
digms versus 123). The rest were absorbed with-
out any loss. By raining test data on the manually
discovered knowledge base and on the PARA-
DIGM acquired knowledge base we noted up to
10% improvement In analysis time. In hypothesis-
ing the lexical status and morphological features
of the unknown words, based only on endings
analysis, the PARADIGM generated knowledge
base was also batter.
A morphological knowledge base for Russian
and another one for Spanish are under develop-
ment. Experiments have also been made with
French, Slovak and Hungarian. In the near future,
we plan to develop the system In two important di-
rections:
- learning compound word-forms rules (proclitic
articulation of nouns and adjectives, verb com-
pound tenses, degrees of comparison for adjec-
tives);
- learning lexical affixes (that is meaning mod-
ifying prefixes and suffixes (Tufis,1988)).
Related work is reported In (Wohtke,1986),
(Trost,1986) but they are either concerned with
English (not a very exciting language from the
morphological point of view) or address gener-
ation or analysis only. The very popular two-level
morphology model of Koskenniemi (1983) in-
tended primarily to derivational morphology is,
from our point of view, too expensive for a gram-
matical oriented processing.
Recent work reported In (Goertz, 1988), (Woth-
ki, 1986), (Zock,1988) share some points with our
approach.
We consider that the main contributions of our
work stem from the following features:
- freedom in defining the categorial system for
the model;
- independence of a specific natural language,
provided It is within our &amp;quot;root + ending&amp;quot; approach;
- applicability of the synthesized rules both in
analysing and generating word forms;
- possibility of rapid development of morphologi-
cal knowledge bases, by merging the results of
many parallel acquisition sessions;
CP-L - 151 -
- duality of system behaviour (apprentice - ex-
pert) which allows immediate check of the ac-
quired knowledge;

<abstract confidence="0.99307">The paper proposes a paradigmatic approach to morphological knowledge acquisition. It addresses the problem of learning from examples rules for word-forms analysis and synthesis. These rules, established by generalizing the training data sets, are effectively used by a built-in interpreter which acts consequently as a morphological processor within the architecture of a natural language question-answering system. The PARADIGM system has no a priori knowledge which should restrict it to a particular natural language, but Instead builds up the morphological rules based only on the examples provided, be they in Romanian, English, French, Russian, Slovak and the like.</abstract>

PARADIGM was conceived to overcome, at least partially, these difficulties and to provide a handy tool for immediate verification of specific rules validity. As the general situation is with learning systems, different copies of PARADIGM may be used in parallel and finally merge the individually developed knowledge bases. This is beneficialy not only with respect to the development time but also with respect to the linguistic coverage. Architecturally, PARADIGM was influenced by DISCIPLE (Tecuci, 1988) in the sense that the behavioral dichotomy &amp;quot;apprentice-expert&amp;quot; was Incorporated into its implementation. However, due to the more specific task, the technical solutions adopted in PARADIGM for knowledge acquisition are different, being problem oriented. 2.
