<bodyText confidence="0.993209428571429">
The 21st Annual Meeting of the Association for
Computational Linguistics will be held Wednesday,
June 15 through Friday, June 17, 1983, at the Massa-
chusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massa-
chusetts. Papers are being solicited on linguistically
and computationally significant topics, including but
not limited to the following:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9994968">
• syntax, parsing, and language generation, includ-
ing aspects of linguistic theories relevant to com-
putational models,
• computational semantics, including logic, refer-
ence, anaphora, and metaphor,
• discourse analysis and speech acts,
• representation of knowledge, deduction, and plan-
ning as related to language understanding or
production,
• speech analysis and synthesis,
• machine translation, machine-aided translation,
and automated dictionaries,
• formal foundations of computational linguistics,
• applied computational linguistics, and
• software tools for computational linguistics.

An author wishing to present a paper should submit
six copies of a five to eight page summary, double-
spaced, by February 1, 1983 to: Mitchell Marcus,
2D-443, Bell Laboratories, 600 Mountain Avenue,
Murray Hill, New Jersey, 07974 [phone: (201) 582-
3948].
It is important that the summary contain sufficient
information, including references to relevant literature,
to convey the new ideas and allow the program com-
mittee to determine the scope of the work. Authors
should clearly indicate to what extent the work is com-
plete and, if relevant, to what extent it has been im-
plemented. A summary exceeding eight double-spaced
pages in length may not receive the attention it de-
serves.
All submissions will be read by the program com-
mittee, which is chaired by Mitchell Marcus, Bell Lab-
oratories, and consists of Philip Cohen, Fairchild Cam-
era and Instrument Corp., Lauri Karttunen, University
of Texas, Austin, William Mann, USC/ Information
Sciences Institute, Robert Moore, SRI International,
Ann Robinson, Symantec, and Robert Wilensky, Uni-
versity of California, Berkeley.
Authors will be notified of the acceptance of their
papers by March 7, 1983. Full-length versions of
accepted papers submitted by April 18, 1983 will be
included in the Proceedings of the Conference.
Local arrangements are being handled by Jonathan
Allen, Department of Electrical Engineering and Com-
puter Science, MIT, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139
[phone: (617) 253-2509; ARPANET: ja@mit-ai].
For other information regarding the annual meet-
ing, contact: Don Walker (ACL), Artificial Intelli-
gence Center, SRI International EJ278, Menlo Park,
California, 94025 [phone: (415) 859-3071; ARPAN-

Call for Papers - IJCAI-83
The Eighth International Joint Conference on Arti-
ficial Intelligence, IJCAI-83, will be held in Karlsruhe,
West Germany, on August 8-12, 1983. There will also
be a two-day Tutorial Program from AISB and GI on
August 7 and 8, 1983.
The IJCAI conferences are the main forum for the
presentation of Artificial Intelligence research to an
international audience. The goal of IJCAI-83 is to
promote scientific interchange, within and between all
subfields of Artificial Intelligence, among researchers
from all over the world. The conference is sponsored
by International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelli-
gence, Inc., and co-sponsored by Gesellschaft fiir In-
formatik (West Germany), the Society for the Study of
Artificial Intelligence and the Simulation of Behaviour
(Britain), and Nederlandse Vereniging voor kunstma-
tige Intelligentie (The Netherlands).
Papers concerning all aspects of Artificial Intelli-
gence will be considered. Complete drafts, in English,
should be received by the program chairman by Febru-
ary 1, 1983. Final versions of accepted papers will
appear in the conference proceedings.
The refereeing and the sessions will be organized
around the following subfields: Automatic Program-
ming, Cognitive Modelling, Expert Systems, Knowl-
edge Representation, Learning and Knowledge Acqui-
sition, Logic Programming, Natural Language, Plan-
ning and Search, Robotics, System Support, Theorem
Proving, and Vision.
In addition to the contributed papers, the program
will include several invited papers, panel discussions,
and special interest sessions. Suggestions for these
should be sent to the program chairman.
The conference will also include program demon-
strations and exhibits. Submissions and requests in
these categories should be directed to the local ar-
rangements chairmen. Program demonstrations will
not be refereed.
Submissions to the technical program and program
enquiries should be sent to the program chairman:
