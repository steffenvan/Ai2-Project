Summary
The paper describes a preliminary staltre of authorIP inrurr
aimed at integrating the 4possible wo&amp;quot;lr approa,Th with the
idea of treating utterances as programs. It is clnimed that
providing sonhisticated facilities for manipulating possible
world&apos;&apos; descrintions should be one of the main concerns in
designing a natural language understanding system. The logical
notion of possible world&amp;quot; has a close counterpart in the
computer science notion of the environment of expression
evaluation. The idea of treating utterances as programs is
generalized by allowing envi-sonmeht ovitr&apos;hing during the eval-
uation of an utterance. A model of natural language, based an
multiple environments in the sense just mentioned, is outlined
in terms of computer science. A rough classification of envi-
ronment types is given. One structure of environments iR de,
voted to keeping track of the direct and indirect speech re-
cursive quotations. Another structure is assigned to every
person involved in a discourse or mentioned in it; it is used
to handle belief-sentences, lies and promises. A third type of
environment is used to represent the structure of topics in a
discourse. Advantages of the advocated approach, called the
multinle environment model of natural language&amp;quot; are demon-
strated in the discussion of well-known problems of vre,f-rence
aria, presuppositions.

They have been derived by the author independently (Bien 1975)
while explortnP the Davies and IsPrd(1972) approach of treating
utterances as programs.
The subject examined in the paper is itself broad and encom-
passes many controversies;however, it is not the author s intent
to make a case for the ideas prsented. Firstly, the limits of
the paper do not permit a proper discussion of the pros and cons
for each solution pronosed; and furthemore most of these prob-
lems have a triadition dating as far back as the Middle Ages,
in some cases. And seconaiy, the author has not yet developed
all of his own concepts fully enough to warrent a detailed
presentation. Insteaa,the paner seeks to present the simplicity
and generality of the proposed approach
The paner is an enlarged and modified version of a talk
delivered at the Fourth International Joint Conference on
Artificial Intelligence in Tbilisi. The modifications envolve
mainly the terminology and the form of presentation; the only
essential change of some importance is the different treatment
of the first and second person pronouns.
Most of the examples in the paper are direct quotations from

It is now obvious that the human ability to use language is re-
lated Closely to intelligence itself.Neverthelesslthe complexitN
of hatural language is still rather underestimated by linguists,
which results usually in using relatively primitive tools for a
formal description of language. Although such formalisms like
e. 6. transformational grammar may be theoretically adequate,
from a practical point of view they are too cumbersome; (in my
opinion writing a transformational grammar may be only compared
with programming a sophisticated system exclusively in an as-
sembly language). The main merit of Artificial Intelligence for
the development of computational linguistics lies in suggesting
a quite new way of thinking about language. It consists in
shifting the attention af research from linguistic competence
to linguistic perfomance and -creating the latter as an opera-
tion of a real or imagined language processor, which in turn
can be discussed in terms of computer science.Winorad (19722)
claims even that the best test of a complex model of natural
language is to implement it as language understanding system.
Although he is basically correct, in the present state of

art, the objection posed by Charniak is often valikt. harniak
(1y(2:2) noticed that most programs in Artificial Intelligence
handle only a few kinds of selected test examples. Deciding
that a program can be extended in some easily imaginable way to
handle more examples or more sophisticated cases reguires prac-
tically the same procedure as verifying a non-programmed theory.
Therefore, I treat Winograd&apos;s postulate as a long-term aim, and
at this moment I advocate a less ambitious strategy: to use as
mtUch possible of the computer science intuitions in natural
language description. This is in fact also the approach of
Longuet-Higgins (1972) who states that natural language ut-
terances are just programs to be run in our brains.
Some interesting analogies between lahguage understanding and
running a POP-2 program have been shown e. g. in (Davies,
Isard 1972). I pursue this approach in another direction,
charqcterised by an intensive use of the notion of environment.
In the earlier stage of the inquiry, represented by (Bien 1975),
I thought that all the environment manipulations which were
necessary for the feasibility of my approach could be realiLed
by means of the Bobrow and Ciegbreit multipa environments
primitives (1972); therefore, I have introduced the term
multiple environments model of natural language . Now i am not
sure of it, because I see reasons to use e. g. cross-world
bindings , whose relation to the Bobrow-Wegbreit primitives is
not yet clear to me. Anyway, I still use the term multiple an-
7
vironments model of natural languages because it characterises
well my approach even if it is to be understood only metaphor-
ically.
It should be noted that considering all utterances as a kind of
imperative is not a new idea for linguists; it can be found
s. 4. in (Wierzbicka 1969), but to my knowledge such AGeas had
no practical impact on linguistic research.
2,2. The notion o/ alscourse.
The notion of discourse (called also coherent text) ig a
rather vague one. I will try to clarify my use of the term
by discussing several aspects of coherency.
First, there is a type of coherency which I shall Gall textual.
It is realised by these inter-sentence and inter-phrase links
which are visible in the text surface as some lexical items or
syntactical featu&apos;res. Surface realisations of these links I
shall call pointers. A simple but very important class of
pointers consists of pronouns understood in u broad sense,
including pro-adverbs etc. There are also pointers peculiar to
given languages; e. g. after McCawley (197) and Isard (1974)
it is reasonable for English to treat the Past tense as a
pointer, because (isard 1974) it acts as a form of definite
referenne to a past situation on which the attention of the
conversants has recently been focussed The presupposttions
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.532458">
B
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999524">
often function similarly to pointers, but I think that presup-
positions are essentially different from pointers and I prefer
to account for them in another way.
A second type of coherency I shall call situational. The situ-
ation of a conversation can influence the coherence of the
message in two ways. First, it can supply values for these
pointers which are not assigned by the text itself. It is the
case of e. g. (Isard 1974a)
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.936626">
(1) Be careful, he might bite you.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.936889666666667">
said while the adressee is near a dangerous animal. Such an
utterance can be easily transformed into a textually coherent
one by introducing a narrator. The second type of situational
coherency is more subtlelit consists of applying the addressees
knowledge to fill up some relations omitted in the sender s
message. This is needed e* g* in the text (Bellert 1972:79)

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999216">
where the knowledge that the Sorbonne is a French university
has to supply the missing link. In general, a text is situa-
tionally coherent only relative to a given domain of knowledge.
In practice we often communicate our ideas by means of
non-coherent texts; the communication succeeds only because
the addressee modifies his beliefs for the purpose of making
the text coherent relative to this updated domain of his
</bodyText>

oeliefs. Because he does it only if he decides more or less
arbitrarily, that the message has a meaning, such texts I shall
call volitionarilv coherent. A typical example is a text with
a sentence which carries brand new information by means of
presuppositions. The existence of such sentences has been
pointed out by Wieraicka (1969), Bellert (1972:79), recently
by Karttunen (1974:191) who gave the following examples:

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.94007475">
where (4) presupposes the existence of the wife and (5)
that its complement is true but both sentences are used
in situations which do not satisfy these presuppositions.
Tor the sake of completeness it is necessary to mention the
situations, Where the text contain pointers without values, but
they are considered by the addressee as not relevant to the
matter at hand. This situation seems to happen only in literary
texts.

<bodyText confidence="0.9920608">
the evaluation of the re-analysis of a generated text. Second
reason is a practical one: at the present state of art we have
much better insight into the analysis processes than into the
synthesis problems.
According to the present views I take for granted that the
analysis consists of a set of cooperating processes performing
different task, in particular the syntactic, semantic and
pragmatic analysis. By a level mentioned above I mean a seL, vi
such processes which manipulate the notions of similar type, in
the intuitive sense of the same degree of abstractness relative
to the physical message.
I distinguish four levels.
The level responsible for extracting relevant information from
acoustic signal or a visual image I call the sorbtion. I men-
tion it here only for the sake of completeness as I have no-
thing to say on this subject.
The second L.vel, uhch lc the only &apos;joint uf interest of the
present paper, I call the interpretation. I mean lay it the
process taking as data the results of sorbtion (of course, it
does not mean that the sorbtion is to be executed before the
interpretation; the sorbtion should supply partial results on
the request of the interpretation) and yielding some value in
the formalism used in the system under consideration for the
representation of knowledge. For simplicity I assume here that
the knowledge is represented in labelled graphs stored in a

It is often assumed that text processing by a language under-
standing system consists only of those two levels or their
equivalence. I insist on the necessity of two additional levels.
First of them I call judgement.Thi3 io the lc,vol 1c),)Q1-,1:c1e 2o:
keeping the beliefs of the system consistent. As long as triv-
ial worlds are considered, this level can be integrated into
some systematically performed uata base bookkeeping When we
start to model more complicated worlds, we will face the prob-
lem of theoretical ur practical undecidability of bookkeeping
problems and therefor this level is to be thoroughly control-
led by the system supervisor. Such a solution agrees with thc
intuition of Marciszewski (1972:180) that &apos; most beliefs are
spontaneous and that it is the entertaining of a belief with
the awareness of non-accepting that requires a special act of
giving up; the suspension of judgement is therefore an act more
sophisticated than spontaneous pelief4
The fourth lavel, which I call the integration, should be de-

signed to memorize the facts marked by the judgement level as
important enough to be stored. As far as I know, the inVesti-
gation of the problets related to this level has been neglected,
the only exceptions being the works of Chafe, in particular
(Chafe 1973).
Ambiguities,
All the recent works on speech understanding as well as on
discourse analysis show that the result of interpretation is as
a rule ambiguous. For particular domains of discourse we often
find some particular rules to disambiguate sentences, but the
final solution consists, in my opinion, in formalizing and
implementing general pragmatic rules, Which I Shall sketch.
below.
The highest priority rule should be the rule of coherency. It
says that this interpretation of a discourse is better which
yields as the value the more dense graph.The density of a graph
can be computed as e.g. the ratio of graph arrows to the number
of nodes; if our grapns are frame structures in the sense of
Winograd (1974), we can compute the ratio of the important el-
ements filled up to the important element slots left unas-
signed. I feel it is just the rule which chooses properly the
referent of the last sentence &apos;Ishe&apos; in the examples (Charniak

In general, the net effect of the coherence Tule will be that
ILetimes the reCerents of different noun l&apos;iraâce,-. (nra in gen-
Pral, the linguistic 14eans which I call designators) aro col-
lapsed to form one object for the sake of the higher density of
the result. Therefore the rule will also help us to handle
p:oesuppositions properly. We may treat every preupposItion as
carrying brand new information and leave for the coherency
rule the task of collapsing eventually the presupposed facts
with the facts already known by the system.
Second rum I call the consistency rule. I mean by it the
simple but important rule:if one interpretation of hn utterance
is incorisistent, look for another Interpretation. It explains
why for the utterance (Russel 1905):

To summarizej think the only solution to the ambiguity problem
is the breadth first search in the sense of Charniak (1972:75)
with the above-mentioned rules used to evaluate the inter-
pretdtions. It does not mean that I neglect the need fo,12 the
rules peculiar for particular discourse domains. They are nec-
essary for efficiency of the interpretation process and they
should drive the searchlbut they may not be allowed to override
any interpretation, as is the case in the Wilks preference
grammar. For the sentence (Wilks 1974:32)
(18) The hunter licxed his gun all over, and the stock
tasted especially good,
the real world knowledge would probably cause the interpreta-
tion with the &amp;quot;soup&apos;&apos; sense of stock to be found first,but the
coherency rule would properly choose the interpretation where
stock is understood as a part of the gun.

,3.1, The notion of environment,
In actual language understanding systems the facts stored in
the system memory are classified according to their ontological
status in a very rough way. Usually they are split into the
classes: past versus present and reality versus possible
future ; the only exceptions are the system for playing tic-
tac-toe of Isard (1974), Joshi and Weischedel (1973). In the
linguistic literature one can easily find the ideas of pos-
sible worlds used to handle the modal concepts,but more subtle
possible worlds classifications was disoussed, to the best of
my knowledge, only by Lakoff (1968) and Morgan (1969). My claim
is that we need a very sophisticated classification scheme
for the possible worlds features.
A set of facts to which I assign the same ontological status
I will call environment. The term is borrowed from computer
science, where it means all variables accessible from a givell
program point together with their values. My use of the term is
justified by the fact that the access to the system memory is
ussually performed by matching a pattern against an associative
data base, resulting in binding the free variables of the pat-
tern to some values found in the memory; access to different
environments in the sense defined above may result in different
binding of the variables, which is also the case with the
</bodyText>

environments understood in the computer science sense.
For the purpose of the present paper environments can be
thouLfat of aJ :,1Absets of a DIJNITER-like data base wi.th contens
specified by some filters in goal state lents. In relit 7 such
an implementation would probably be inefficient and therefore
it it5 necessary to look for another solutLon, stathng with the
notion of context in Conniver (Sussman, McDermot 1972) and
QA4 (Rulifson et al 1972).
The crucial point of the presented approach conJists in al-
lowing quite complicated access environment structures, to
stress this fact use the te2m environmentb%
Person environments.
A sophisticated language understanding system has to take into
account the fact that some other beings also have the ability to
use natural language, to remember events, to make inferences
etc. For the sake of simplicity any real or fictious being
capable of using a natural language will be called a person.
Practically, persons will be either humans, engaged in a dis-
course with the system or humans mentioned in such a discourse,
but we can mean by persons also another language understanding
systems and robots, persofinications of an&apos;imals from children
tales, etc. In the lack of arguments to the contrary, the sys-
tem will assume that the language using abilities of other

processes by running recursively its awn language processing

a treatment allows it to obtain the correct value of the sen-

Frank to be created or recovered with the prounon &amp;quot;I&amp;quot; preset
to Frank; the interpretation ot (21.2) is done by the recursive
call to the language processing routine in the environment of
Frank. The mention of John yields the environment of John,which
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.627465666666667">
is embedded in the environment of Frank; therefore from the
point of view of the system, it is the environment of John as
described by Frank. This person environment has the pronoun

<bodyText confidence="0.97367375">
I&apos;&apos; preset as usual to the respective person and the pronoun
you&apos; is set to his current interlocutor, i,. . Frank. The sen-
tence (21.3) and other sentences reported by Frank as said by
John are interpreted in this environment.
P!Illtiple person environments allow the system to keep track of
lifferenceu in person&apos;s knowledge, which has importance for
nany reasons. For example, it is difficult to account for the
use of the indefinite noun phrase in (22.5) in the text

By keeping track of the knowledge and beliefs for every person

According to our treatment of presupposition, the value of that

The difference between (25) and (26) consists in the environ-

It should be noted thdt the class of non-factual sentences and

easily account for it by evaluating this noun phrase only in
the environment oi Janet.
Some cases involving non-factual interpretations of phmses

rn the above discussion of persons we have assumed that exactly
one environment is assigned to every person. There are several
arguments for splitting this environment into at least three

Pretense and knowledge,

pretense (which is equivalent to nctIon of point of refer-
ence used by Isard) and the judgement durin,; the comparison of
the value of (34) with the content of respective person envi
ronment founds them compatible.
The distinction between behaviour and pretense is more dis-
cutable, as it yields subtlety not needed in most applications.
It is useful to handle e. b. slips of tongue and to distinguish
different a.pects of what is said (Ziff 1972).
To account for such linguistic facts like e. g. the accept-

environments,namely the environment of desires and the environ-
ment of intentions.
The word &amp;quot;knowledge&apos; in the term knowledge environment&amp;quot; is not
to be understood literally. In fact it describes the knowledge
attributed to somebody on the evidence of its behaviour, state-
ments etc. This justifieu using the term impression environ-
ments to cover all the environments assigned to a person.
&apos;.4. Choosing an environment.
From the preceeding paragrapn it follows that during discourse
analysis we have usually several environment 6 at hand. Every
phrase is to be interpreted in at least one environment. This
poses the problem of choosing the proper environments for
the interpretation of a given phrase. &apos;ie will see that there
exist several strategies to handle the problem, which differ
in the amount of computational resources (time and memory) used
this fact may be considered to be the analogue of the human
ability to change the amount of attention devoted to discourse
undre standing.
Let us imagine a highly sophisticdted computer-aided instruc-
tion system. During a teaching session with a student the sys-
tem models its interlocutor by means of a person environment,
composed of the behaviour environment (used e.. to
the student response time), the pretense and the knowledge
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.588279">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.98137264">
environments. The knowledge environment is preset to some
general knowledge and it is systematically updated by .,e ana-
lysis of student utterances. Ef We do not exclude the po
sibility that the student lies, we should interprete them
directly in his knowledge environment. In any cFIL-e,the Fretense
is useful to store the results of such performatives as
student&apos;s definitions of symbols etc. If the student quotes a
manual or a lecturer, it is necessary to create a new person
environment and to evaluate the whole quoted passage in it &apos;.Then
the system is going to say somethilig to the student, it ,faould
verify wh,ther the utte-2a::,- -
atudent. The verification is made by running its utterance in
the student&apos;s environment, which allows it to compare the real
intention (4, its utterance with the intention probably assigned
to it by student. To be more strict, in the student&apos;s environ-
ment the environment of the system as imagined by the student
should be created, and the utterance run in the pretense of it;
the results should be compared with the results of running the
utterances in the proper pretense of the system.
Opviously,this is a complicated and resource consuming process,
difficult to carry on with reasonable efficiency. Newertheless,
I think that processes performed in the mind of a talented
teacher working at full capabilities must be similar.
Let us now take an example from the other extreme, when the
system works according to the reliability rule â¢ It may be the
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.66918">

<bodyText confidence="0.933275608695652">
system from our first example during a session of knowledge
acquisition when discussing a subject with a teacher. Now it
is quite possible to introduce all the information directly to
the knowledge environment of thu cyr,tem, &apos;1119.1.3
crodouply accepting everything what is said, It is evidently
quite easy both for humans and computers, in practice humanJ
apply this strategy mainly when they are forced to devote most
of their computational power to other tasks of a higher
priority.
Between these two extremes there exist many mixed strategies,
where the system for every person of the discourse makes an
independent decision, whether or not to create a new environ-
ment, based both on the reliability of the person and the
availability of resources.
3.5, Topic environments.
The usual way of handling the reference problem is to compute
for every noun phrase or pronoun a separate list of possible
referents and to use some heuristics to choose one element from
the list. Another approach, advocated here, consists in storing
all possible referents permanently available into a special
topic environments. The items stored in the topic environments
may be the symbols of physical object as well as some relations
and other semantic data structures, put there during the aval.

are inteppreted as declarations, used to create appropriate
data structures to be put into the topic; therefore we do not
need the Ref operator of Bellert (1972:3 ) introduced to handle
such examples.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9644155">
In every topic environment the items are rdered in some way;
the access routine yield: en request the subsequent elements
of the topic in the very order; if the environment is exhausted
and some new candidate for a referent is needed tae ac es
routine switches to the respective super-environment.
Every succesful access to the topic cauEes its permutation,which
results in making the accesued item the first element of the
environment.
The essential difference between tl!e traditional approach and
that presented here lies in the possibility o&apos; stricturing a
topic environment.
For example (Isard 1974a), in the text:
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.6447722">
()9.1) What did John say about Dick?
(39.2) He said that
(39.3) he looked like a arunken gLraffe on ite skates.
there is no doubt that 1\14&apos; of (39.3) refers to Dick.We account
for it in the following way: every first use of a vero of the

t(verbum dicendi type causes a new topic environment to be
created; the environment is initialised, in our case to Dick
and then itself becomes an item of the current topic, Tne next
mention of that act of communication cawes the seerch in the
current topic for the environment previously stored; when it is
found, the reported clause is interpreted within it. Tn our
case the first word of the reported clause is the pronoun
which calls the access routine for a possible referent. /W he
first and only possible referent of the current topic is Dick(
the pronoun is properly bound.
In the case of the text

tae pronoun will be also at first bound to Dick from the topic
But when tne proper name &apos;DickÂ° will be evaluated, an attempt
will be made to shift Dick to the first position in the topic
where it already is located. This is a violcItion of the eifi-
ciency rule, and this interpretation will â¢e rejected. Next
possible refrent will then be obtain from the super-environment
yielding the correct result.
There are some exceptions to the efficiency rule; in particular
redundancy is desirable immediately after topic switching:

By designators I understand the linguistic means used to refer
to particular objects. Designators may be classified roughly
into three classes: proper names; common names and description.
All three kinds of designators have been discussed for centuries
by philosophers and logicians; our pragmatic approach to the
designators is based mainly on the works of Kripke (1972) and
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.662165">

<note confidence="0.384671">
Donnellan (1971).
</note>
<bodyText confidence="0.949835545454546">
The characteristic feature of proper names is that their use
must be preceded by the act of fixing thoreference. Contrary
to popular opinion, in practice proper names ate much more
ambiguous than common names , because propeTnames refer to
individuals and common names to classes of individuals. For
example, there are many men called John and if we are
to understand e. g.
(43) John has come.
we need to have the referent of John already fixed. Different
types of object have proper names of different stability.
Countries, towns, mountains etc. have often unique names which
are rarely changed.Most human full names are also rather stable
from the practical point of view.Forenames are so ambiguous that
their referents have to be reset again and again in every dis-
course, e.g. by quoting the full hame of the person in question.
Such proper names as first and second per9on &apos;pronouns may
alternate their meaning even during one discourse. To sumarize,
proper names in fact name some recognition routine supplied in
the act of fixing the reference.
Common names do not refer directly to individuals, but they are
names of characteristic functions of the respective sets of
individuals;their meaning is so stable that they can be assumed
to belong to the knowledge of the world; and therefore, fixing
the reference, except in some peculiar cases, need not be
30
performed.
Descriptions are compound names constructed ad hoc by special
linguistic means, like qualifying n common noun by an adjective
etc. They name also respective compound chnraoteristic
functions.
All the designators are usually used in the referential way.
That means that the respctive procedure is evaluntLd in a
proper environment to yield the intended referent. Such treat-
ment agrees in particular with Donnellan&apos; intuition that a
definite description does not in itself refer to anything but
only its use points to a referent. Therefore, we may explain
easily why the sentence (Donnellan 1971:110):
(44) Her husband is kind to her.
can be sometimes properly understood even if the man refered to
is not the husband of the woman, such a sentence is just to be
evaluated in the environment of false belie 3 of the sender.
Quite often the sender uses underspcified descriptions, i. e.
the descriptions which refer to a much larger set of individ-
uals than it is intended, e. g. in Charniak (1972:72):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.992809666666667">

(45.2) She put the plate on the kitchen table and went into

&amp;quot;the platel of (45.2) by itself refers to every plate of the

characteristic function to the object on his current topic;
if it does not suffice, he need to eliminate the remaining
ambiguities in the usual way, i. e. by means of the coherency,
consistency and efficiency rules.
All designators except pronouns can also be use in an attribut-
ive way. In this case they mean just their characteristic
functions. For example
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.78673">
(46) Mount Everst is Chomolungma.
means that in the sender&apos;s beliefs the characteristic function

(47) He is a little Napoleon.
More common is attributive use of common names and descriptions,
g.
(48) The Smith&apos;s murdered is insane.
in the sense of
(49) Whoever has murdered Smith, he is insane.
Attributive use of indefinite descriptions is also &apos;mown as
nonspecific setting , e. g. (Charniak 1972:178) a kitten
in (50. )-
.
(50.1) Jack wanted a kitten.
(50.2) Bill had a kitten and Jack offered to trade his ball
for the kitten.
32
(50.3) Bill wanted to keep his kitten, so Jack went to look
for George who also had a kitten.
(50.4) George was willing to trade so Jack got his kitten.
It is interesting that the SHRDLU program (Winograd 197)
treat indefinite descriptions,which are used only attributively,
e. g.
(51) pick up a big block

<bodyText confidence="0.934857944444445">
(52) find a block which is taller than the one you are
holding ana put it into the box
just along the lines given above, i. e. as programs with a free
variable (Winograd 1972:130), although Winograd himself de-
stribes it, probably influenced by the logical tradition, by
means of the variable bound by the existential nuantifier
(1972:i26).
The characteristic feature of proper and comon nouns Is that
they are always to be run in a single environment. It is not
the case with descriptions which may require suitable split-
ting between several environments. It has been noted by
Winograd (1972:147) with respct to the time reference, e. g.:
(53) Many rich men made their fortunes during the depression.
(54) Many rich men lost their fortunes during the depression.
(55) Many rich men worked in restaurants during the depres-
sion.
In these sentences the Â°rich men&apos;&apos; phrase is to be evaluated in

Obviously, the interpretations (57) and (58) differ in the way
the phrase rtthe friend of Kowalski&apos;s brother is split between
the environments of the knowledge of the sender and the know-
ledge of Smith.
ince we allow designators to switch environments, we have no
problem with so called nouns with empty denotdtion ; they are
to be evaluated in the respective fictitious worlds, e.g.

In this paragraph we shall discuss the reference problem for

We shall formulate a rule intended to substitute the tcommand
rule af the transformational grammar. The arguments in savour
of our rule are simplicity, better adequacy and use e of tho
demon facility whicn should be present in the system for other
reasons (Charniak 1972).
First, we shall remind that every accesn to the topic permuted
it by advancing the accessed element to the very beginnjng
of the topic; succesful evaluation of a designator introducing
4 new object puts the repreentation of the object also at
the very beginning of the topic. Our rule states that the main
clause pronouns immediately execute access to the
while the evaluation of subordinate clause pronouns may be
suspnded if tliere no suitable value for them In the
topic; all the pronouns should be resolved be ore the cnc cf
the main clause processing.
Let us see how the rule works for examples from (McCawiey
1L,A(t:226).
(60) kfter John left his apartment, he went to the pool hall.
The proper name I\John&amp;quot; advances the Jonn&apos;s representation at
the beginni4g of the topic. The pronoun &amp;quot;his&apos;\ is evaluated
because there is at least one suitable value in the topic,
i.e. John ; if bounding of &amp;quot;his&amp;quot; to John is rejected by some
pragmatic rule, another possible referent is found, t&apos;ne&apos;&apos; is
set to it and the referent is advanced at the beginning
of the topic, getting ahead of John â¢ When &apos;&apos;he&apos;t is evaluated,

<page confidence="0.533209">

it is usually bound to the same referent as &apos;\his&amp;quot;, which may
be John or some other person.

sus-
pended if there is no rluitable value for &apos;the&amp;quot; or rs In
the topic; if the clause is suspended, it can be resumed when
evaluation of &amp;quot;Joh .1 puts its value to the topic.
(62) John went to the pool room after he left is apartment.
There is no problem with the sentence; Johnlk sets the topic
supplying a possible value for &amp;quot;he&amp;quot; and
(63) He went to the pool hall after John left his apartment.
The \&apos;he&amp;quot; is evaluated immediately; therefore the evaluation of
Johnlâ  cannot influence its value. The strong feeling that the
value of 4 he&apos; should be different from John is explained as
the violation of the efficiency rule: if you can refer to an
object by a pointer and there is no possibility of misunder-
standing, do not refer to it by a designator.
(64) A boy who saw her kissed a girl who knew him.
I am anxious to see a sentence of this type in an authentic
English text, not as an example of areference problem, because
I do not see any circumstances under which such a sentence
can be uttered. None the less, we can handle the example easily.
First, &apos;La boy&amp;quot; is is evaluated,yielding a person environment which
is put into the topic. Next,ft who saw her&amp;quot; is evaluated except
36
for the her because of the lack of a suitable value for It in
the topic; therefore , the clnuse ir uspended. Then the rest
of the main clause is evaluated and the person environmant for
R girl is created, resulting in an updating of the topic.
Now the suspended clause can be resumed and evaluated in paral-
lel with the clause who knew hie; all the pronouns will be
properly bound.
Although it should be obvious, it is better to state explicity
that the value of his in (60)-(63) is finally fixed by the
coherency rule.
Analogically as with subordinate clauses, we can treat paren-
thethical clauses and phrases, e. g.:
(65) In John&apos;s apartment, he smokes pot.
(66) In his apartment, John smokes pot.
and obtain the desired results.

Even if some of the presented ideas may become obsolete throught
further research,the usefulness of the sophi,,6J.uated environment
structures for natural language descriptions seems evident. The
notion of environment deserves a place as a crucial notion in
a fully adequate theory of natural language. It is important
that the environment structures postulated here involve quite
complicated embedding of environments without any static
restrictions on the depth of the embedding. At the present
state of art, it is convenient to describe such structl:Ires in
terms of computer science, because e. G. tormal icc i o _c,

<abstract confidence="0.98962325">Summary paper describes a preliminary staltre of authorIP at integrating the wo&amp;quot;lr the utterances as programs. It is clnimed that sonhisticated facilities possible world&apos;&apos; descrintions should be one of the main concerns in natural language understanding system. The logical of possible a close counterpart the computer science notion of the environment of expression The idea of treating utterances as programs by allowing ovitr&apos;hing during the evaluation of an utterance. A model of natural language, based an multiple environments in the sense just mentioned, is outlined terms of computer science. rough classification of envitypes is given. One structure of environments voted to keeping track of the direct and indirect speech recursive quotations. Another structure is assigned to every involved in a discourse or in it; it is used handle lies and promises. A third type of is used represent the structure of topics in a discourse. Advantages of the advocated approach, called the multinle environment model of natural language&amp;quot; are demonin the discussion of well-known problems of aria, presuppositions.</abstract>
