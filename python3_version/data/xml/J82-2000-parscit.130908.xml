Affiliations: The ACL is a constituent member of the Ameri-
can Federation of Information Processing Societies, and is
also associated with the International Committee on Compu-
tational Linguistics.
Subscriptions to the AJCL are available only through mem-
bership in the ACL. Each subscription includes both hard-
copy and microfiche versions of the Journal.
Annual membership dues are $15 for individuals and $30
for institutions. Joint memberships for couples are available
for $20, but provide only one subscription.
Postage: The AJCL is normally mailed bulk-rate. First class
mailing is available in North America for an additional annual
charge of $6. Air-printed mailing is available overseas for
an additional annual charge of $12.
Back issues of the AJCL may be ordered at annual rates of
$15 for individuals and $30 for institutions. The first five
volumes (1974-1978) are available only on microfiche; Vol-
umes 6 and 7 (1980 and 1981) are available in both hard-
copy and microfiche form; first class mailing is an additional
$6, and air-printed mailing is an additional $12. The AJCL
was not published during 1979.
Payments for dues or back issues should be sent to the ACL
Secretary-Treasurer at the address given above. Checks
should be made out to the Association for Computational
Linguistics (or to ACL) and should be payable in U.S. dollars.
There is an additional $2 charge for bank processing costs
for checks that are not drawn on U.S. banks.
Address changes should be sent to the ACL
Secretary-Treasurer at the address given above.
A Note from the Editor:
The technical contents of this issue consist of the proceedings of a work-
shop that was held at Stanford University just prior to the ACL Annual
Meeting of June 29 â€” July 1, 1981. An explanation of how the workshop
came about and who is responsible for it is included in the Introduction by
Carroll Johnson and Joan Bachenko. The five areas surveyed in the Proceed-
ings provide a good overview of the state of the art of a major portion of
Computational Linguistics, and these surveys should be of interest to readers
just entering the field as well as to those who have long been active. The
references, in particular, should prove of considerable value. We regret that it
has taken this long after the workshop to assemble this collection of papers,
but the large number of people involved made it inevitable that some would
not find it possible to meet the schedule which was set up for an earlier date
of publication.
The workshop itself gave the individual panels time for extended discussion,
and culminated in the panel chairmen giving oral presentations of their
panelists&apos; observations and findings. Panel chairmen were, in general, careful
to distinguish between their conclusions and those of their panelists, because
there was considerable difference of opinion on such matters as the attain-
ments of existing systems and the prognosis for future ones.
Following the workshop, panel chairmen were required to write up a
summary of their panels&apos; deliberations and to submit the resulting summaries
to panel members for comment and suggestions. Hence, the five panel chair-
men, Gary Hendrix (Natural Language Interfaces), William Mann (Text
Generation), Christine Montgomery (Concept Extraction), Martin Kay
(Machine Translation), and Richard Kittredge (Sublanguages) should be
acknowledged as authors of the papers in this issue. Panelists&apos; contributions
consisted of discussion at the workshop and careful review of their panel
chairmen&apos;s drafts. After a period of rewriting, manuscripts were forwarded for
review to the Navy Research Laboratory, where further editorial review was
exercised.
As this issue goes to press, we have in hand, machine-readable versions of
the three papers which will comprise the next issue. They should be printed in
final form by us and ready for duplication and binding by the time you read
this. Hence, this issue will be followed by one more under our editorial
by-line before James Allen takes over. We are in the process of cleaning up
our files on pending papers and transferring them to the new editor, and new
contributions should be sent directly to him.
We would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the contributions of
our Production Editor, Cay Dietrich, in transforming raw, machine-readable
text with either no formatting commands or (more typically) formatting
commands for a different formatter than the one we are using. Cay has done
a really outstanding job because she not only is an expert in the use of our
computer photocomposition system but also has an understanding of the
technical contents of the papers in question that allows her to produce a
typography and layout that is a credit to the ACL. She has agreed to stay on
as Production Editor, and we are all fortunate for the really large effort she
has made on our behalf. Cay&apos;s last issue was deficient in only one respect: she
failed to include reference to her own contribution as Production Editor in the
listing of AJCL officers. We rectify that omission with this note.
