Typological discourse analysis is the study
of those factors that affect the choice of
constructions in a language, taking the sur-
rounding discourse context into account.
Typically, texts from a large number of lan-
guages are analyzed quantitatively in order
to discover statistical regularities between
functional parameters affecting the choice of
alternations. Examples of alternations are ac-
tive and passive in English or subject-verb
and verb-subject word order in Spanish, and
parameters encode information such as &amp;quot;If
the NP representing the agent of the action
is non-human, the passive construction is rel-
atively more likely&amp;quot; (p. 3).
Typological Discourse Analysis is structured
as follows. The first chapter introduces ty-
pological discourse analysis. This is an ex-
tremely readable overview of what is in-
volved in typological discourse analysis.
Typical discourse parameters, such as hu-
manness, recency of mention of referent,
specificity, and affectedness of patient, are
clearly illustrated, and the methodological
questions of objectivity, generality, and func-
tional classification are discussed.
The remainder of the book illustrates these
issues with detailed analyses of noun-phrase
types, tense and aspect, voice alternations,
word-order variation, and a series of less-
studied phenomena such as Spanish clitic
climbing and subject marking in Korean. The
final chapter concludes with a personal view
of the difficulties involved in determining
differences of meaning between alternations
and in relating these differences to mental
processes.
At first sight, this book would not ap-
pear to have much relevance for compu-
tational linguists. The approach is primar-
ily descriptive, and more abstract explana-
tory principles underlying the phenomena
described are generally avoided. However,
there are several reasons why typological
discourse analysis in general, and its pre-
sentation in this book in particular, should
be of interest. Much linguistic theory, as
well as work in computational linguistics,
is based on a narrow range of languages—
often English and perhaps a few other Eu-
ropean languages. Analysis is usually sen-
tence based and syntactically oriented, so
that the functional characteristics of construc-
tions in their discourse contexts tend to re-
ceive scant consideration. However, it could
be argued that any sophisticated language-
understanding system needs access to such
functional parameters in order to determine
the meaning of a construction. This book pro-
vides sound arguments for a set of universal
functional parameters and a rich set of ex-
amples of how they are applied in a range of
languages.
The main usefulness of this work, how-
ever, will be for those working in language
generation, as a detailed account of the func-
tional properties of constructions is a prereq-
uisite for the most appropriate choice of one
alternation over another in a particular dis-
course context. As most work to date in lan-
guage generation has tended to be restricted
to English and a few other languages, the
cross-linguistic data presented here should
provide both a guide and a challenge for the-
ories of language generation.
In sum, this book provides a detailed ac-
count of typological discourse analysis with
a clear and balanced account of the method-
ological problems encountered in the empiri-
cal analysis of cross-linguistic data.—Michael
