<bodyText confidence="0.9998673125">
Turkish is an agglutinative language with
complex morphological structures, therefore
using only word forms is not enough for many
computational tasks. In this paper we an-
alyze the effect of morphology in a Named
Entity Recognition system for Turkish. We
start with the standard word-level representa-
tion and incrementally explore the effect of
capturing syntactic and contextual properties
of tokens. Furthermore, we also explore a new
representation in which roots and morphologi-
cal features are represented as separate tokens
instead of representing only words as tokens.
Using syntactic and contextual properties with
the new representation provide an 7.6% rela-
tive improvement over the baseline.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.99917925">
One of the main tasks of information extraction is
the Named Entity Recognition (NER) which aims to
locate and classify the named entities of an unstruc-
tured text. State-of-the-art NER systems have been
produced for several languages, but despite all these
recent improvements, developing a NER system for
Turkish is still a challenging task due to the structure
of the language.
Turkish is a morphologically complex language
with very productive inflectional and derivational
processes. Many local and non-local syntactic struc-
tures are represented as morphemes which at the
The author is also affiliated with iLab and the Center for the
Future of Work of Heinz College, Carnegie Mellon University
end produces Turkish words with complex morpho-
logical structures. For instance, the following En-
glish phrase “if we are going to be able to make
[something] acquire flavor” which contains the nec-
essary function words to represent the meaning can
be translated into Turkish with only one token “tat-
landırabileceksek” which is produced from the root
“tat” (flavor) with additional morphemes +lan (ac-
quire), +dır (to make), +abil (to be able), +ecek (are
going), +se (if) and +k (we).
This productive nature of the Turkish results in
production of thousands of words from a given root,
which cause data sparseness problems in model
training. In order to prevent this behavior in our
NER system, we propose several features which
capture the meaning and syntactic properties of the
token in addition to the contextual properties. We
also propose using a sequence of morphemes repre-
sentation which uses roots and morphological fea-
tures as tokens instead of words.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows:
Section 2 summarizes some previous related works,
Section 3 describes our approach, Section 4 details
the data sets used in the paper, Section 5 reports
the experiments and results and Section 6 concludes
with possible future work.

the authors followed a statistical approach (HMMs)
for NER task together with some other Information
Extraction related tasks. In order to deal with the
agglutinative structure of the Turkish, the authors
worked with the root-morpheme level of the word
instead of the surface form. A recent work (K¨uc¨uk
and Yazici, 2009) presents the first rule-based NER
system for Turkish. The authors used several in-
formation sources such as dictionaries, list of well
known entities and context patterns.
Our work is different from these previous works
in terms of the approach. In this paper, we present
the first CRF-based NER system for Turkish. Fur-
thermore, all these systems used word-level tok-
enization but in this paper we present a new to-
kenization method which represents each root and
morphological feature as separate tokens.

3 Approach
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999974818181818">
In this work, we used two tokenization methods. Ini-
tially we started with the sequence of words rep-
resentation which will be referred as word-level
model. We also introduced morpheme-level model
in which morphological features are represented as
states. We used several features which were cre-
ated from deep and shallow analysis of the words.
During our experiments we used Conditional Ran-
dom Fields (CRF) which provides advantages over
HMMs and enables the use of any number of fea-
tures.

3.1 Word-Level Model
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999255">
Word-level tokenization is very commonly used in
NER systems. In this model, each word is repre-
sented with one state. Since CRF can use any num-
ber of features to infer the hidden state, we develop
several feature sets which allow us to represent more
about the word.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.621161">
3.1.1 Lexical Model
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999985285714286">
In this model, only the word tokens are used in
their surface form. This model is effective for many
languages which do not have complex morpholog-
ical structures. However for morphologically rich
languages, further analysis of words is required in
order to prevent data sparseness problems and pro-
duce more accurate NER systems.

3.1.2 Root Feature
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999984666666667">
An analysis (Hakkani-T¨ur, 2000) on English and
Turkish news articles with around 10 million words
showed that on the average 5 different Turkish word
forms are produced from the same root. In order to
decrease this high variation of words we use the root
forms of the words as an additional feature.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.9811355">
3.1.3 Part-of-Speech and Proper-Noun
Features
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99922248">
Named entities are mostly noun phrases, such as
first name and last name or organization name and
the type of organization. This property has been
used widely in NER systems as a hint to determine
the possible named entities.
Part-of-Speech tags of the words depend highly
on the language and the available Part-of-Speech
tagger. Taggers may distinguish the proper nouns
with or without their types. We used a Turkish mor-
phological analyzer (Of lazer, 1994) which analyzes
words into roots and morphological features. An ex-
ample to the output of the analyzer is given in Ta-
ble 1. The part-of-speech tag of each word is also
reported by the tool 1. We use these tags as addi-
tional features and call them part-of-speech (POS)
features.
The morphological analyzer has a proper name
database, which is used to tag Turkish person, lo-
cation and organization names as proper nouns. An
example name entity with this +Prop tag is given
in Table 1. Although, the use of this tag is limited
to the given database and not all named entities are
tagged with it, we use it as a feature to distinguish
named entities. This feature is referred as proper-
noun (Prop) feature.

As the last feature, we use the orthographic case
information of the words. The initial letter of most
named entities is in upper case, which makes case
feature a very common feature in NER tasks. We
also use this feature and mark each token as UC or
LC depending on the initial letter of it. We don’t do

3.2 Morpheme-Level Model
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99931956">
Using Part-of-Speech tags as features introduces
some syntactic properties of the word to the model,
but still there is missing information of other mor-
phological tags such as number/person agreements,
possessive agreements or cases. In order to see the
effect of these morphological tags in NER, we pro-
pose a morpheme-level tokenization method which
represents a word in several states; one state for a
root and one state for each morphological feature.
In a setting like this, the model has to be restricted
from assigning different labels to different parts of
the word. In order to do this, we use an additional
feature called root-morph feature. The root-morph
is a feature which is assigned the value “root” for
states containing a root and the value “morph” for
states containing a morpheme. Since there are no
prefixes in Turkish, a model trained with this feature
will give zero probability (or close to zero probabil-
ity if there is any smoothing) for assigning any B-*
(Begin any NE) tag to a morph state. Similarly, tran-
sition from a state with B-* or I-* (Inside any NE)
tag to a morph state with O (Other) tag will get zero
probability from the model.
In morpheme-level model, we use the following
features:

F-Measure score in organization entity, morpheme-
level is much better than word-level model in terms
of recall.
Using morpheme-level tokenization to introduce
morphological information to the model did not hurt
the system, but it also did not produce a signifi-
cant improvement. There may be several reasons for
this. One can be that morphological information is
not helpful in NER tasks. Morphemes in Turkish
words are giving the necessary syntactic meaning to
the word which may not be useful in named entity
finding. Another reason for not seeing a significant
change with morpheme usage can be our represen-
tation. Dividing the word into root and morphemes
and using them as separate tokens may not be the
best way of using morphemes in the model. Other
ways of representing morphemes in the model may
produce more effective results.

6 Conclusion and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999954875">
In this paper, we explored the effects of using fea-
tures like root, POS tag, proper noun and case to the
performance of NER task. All these features seem to
improve the system significantly. We also explored
a new way of including morphological information
of words to the system by using several tokens for a
word. This method produced compatible results to
the regular word-level tokenization but did not pro-
duce a significant improvement.
As future work we are going to explore other ways
of representing morphemes in the model. Here we
represented morphemes as separate states, but in-
cluding them as features together with the root state
may produce better models. Another approach we
will also focus is dividing words into characters and
applying character-level models (Klein et al., 2003).

<context position="6098" citStr="lazer, 1994" startWordPosition="964" endWordPosition="965"> order to decrease this high variation of words we use the root forms of the words as an additional feature. 3.1.3 Part-of-Speech and Proper-Noun Features Named entities are mostly noun phrases, such as first name and last name or organization name and the type of organization. This property has been used widely in NER systems as a hint to determine the possible named entities. Part-of-Speech tags of the words depend highly on the language and the available Part-of-Speech tagger. Taggers may distinguish the proper nouns with or without their types. We used a Turkish morphological analyzer (Of lazer, 1994) which analyzes words into roots and morphological features. An example to the output of the analyzer is given in Table 1. The part-of-speech tag of each word is also reported by the tool 1. We use these tags as additional features and call them part-of-speech (POS) features. The morphological analyzer has a proper name database, which is used to tag Turkish person, location and organization names as proper nouns. An example name entity with this +Prop tag is given in Table 1. Although, the use of this tag is limited to the given database and not all named entities are tagged with it, we use i</context>

Three types of named entities; person, organization and location, were tagged in this dataset. If the word is not a proper name, then it is tagged with other. The number of words and named entities for each NE type from train and tests sets are given in Table 4. Table 4: The number of words and named entities in train and test set #WORDS #PER. #ORG. #LOC.
