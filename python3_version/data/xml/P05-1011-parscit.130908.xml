This paper reports the development of log-
linear models for the disambiguation in
wide-coverage HPSG parsing. The esti-
mation of log-linear models requires high
computational cost, especially with wide-
coverage grammars. Using techniques to
reduce the estimation cost, we trained the
models using 20 sections of Penn Tree-
bank. A series of experiments empiri-
cally evaluated the estimation techniques,
and also examined the performance of the
disambiguation models on the parsing of
real-world sentences.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.998492789473684">
Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG)
(Pollard and Sag, 1994) has been studied extensively
from both linguistic and computational points of
view. However, despite research on HPSG process-
ing efficiency (Oepen et al., 2002a), the application
of HPSG parsing is still limited to specific domains
and short sentences (Oepen et al., 2002b; Toutanova
and Manning, 2002). Scaling up HPSG parsing to
assess real-world texts is an emerging research field
with both theoretical and practical applications.
Recently, a wide-coverage grammar and a large
treebank have become available for English HPSG
(Miyao et al., 2004). A large treebank can be used as
training and test data for statistical models. There-
fore, we now have the basis for the development and
the evaluation of statistical disambiguation models
for wide-coverage HPSG parsing.
The aim of this paper is to report the development
of log-linear models for the disambiguation in wide-
coverage HPSG parsing, and their empirical evalua-
tion through the parsing of the Wall Street Journal of
Penn Treebank II (Marcus et al., 1994). This is chal-
lenging because the estimation of log-linear models
is computationally expensive, and we require solu-
tions to make the model estimation tractable. We
apply two techniques for reducing the training cost.
One is the estimation on a packed representation of
HPSG parse trees (Section 3). The other is the filter-
ing of parse candidates according to a preliminary
probability distribution (Section 4).
To our knowledge, this work provides the first re-
sults of extensive experiments of parsing Penn Tree-
bank with a probabilistic HPSG. The results from
the Wall Street Journal are significant because the
complexity of the sentences is different from that of
short sentences. Experiments of the parsing of real-
world sentences can properly evaluate the effective-
ness and possibility of parsing models for HPSG.

Discriminative log-linear models are now becom-

Riezler et al., 2002; Geman and Johnson, 2002;
Miyao and Tsujii, 2002; Clark and Curran, 2004b;

to introduce inconsistencies in probabilistic models
estimated using simple relative frequency (Abney,
1997). Log-linear models are required for credible
probabilistic models and are also beneficial for in-
corporating various overlapping features.
This study follows previous studies on the proba-
bilistic models for HPSG. The probability, p(tIs), of
producing the parse result t from a given sentence s
is defined as
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.999432666666667">

p(t�s) = pO(tIs) exp( fi(t, s)Ai(t, s))

where po(tIs) is a reference distribution (usually as-
sumed to be a uniform distribution), and T(s) is a set
of parse candidates assigned to s. The feature func-
tion fi(t, s) represents the characteristics of t and s,
while the corresponding model parameter Ai(t, s) is
its weight. Model parameters that maximize the log-
likelihood of the training data are computed using a
numerical optimization method (Malouf, 2002).
Estimation of the above model requires a set of
pairs (ts, T (s)), where ts is the correct parse for sen-
tence s. While ts is provided by a treebank, T(s) is
computed by parsing each s in the treebank. Pre-
vious studies assumed T(s) could be enumerated;
however, the assumption is impractical because the
size of T(s) is exponentially related to the length
of s. The problem of exponential explosion is in-
evitable in the wide-coverage parsing of real-world
texts because many parse candidates are produced to
support various constructions in long sentences.

3 Packed representation of HPSG parse
trees
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999593333333333">
To avoid exponential explosion, we represent T(s)
in a packed form of HPSG parse trees. A parse tree
of HPSG is represented as a set of tuples (m, 1, r),
where m, 1, and r are the signs of mother, left daugh-
ter, and right daughter, respectively1. In chart pars-
ing, partial parse candidates are stored in a chart, in
which phrasal signs are identified and packed into an
equivalence class if they are determined to be equiv-
alent and dominate the same word sequence. A set

of parse trees is then represented as a set of relations
among equivalence classes.
Figure 1 shows a chart for parsing “he saw a
girl with a telescope”, where the modifiee (“saw”
or “girl”) of “with” is ambiguous. Each feature
structure expresses an equivalence class, and the ar-
rows represent immediate-dominance relations. The
phrase, “saw a girl with a telescope”, has two trees
(A in the figure). Since the signs of the top-most
nodes are equivalent, they are packed into an equiv-
alence class. The ambiguity is represented as two
pairs of arrows that come out of the node.
Formally, a set of HPSG parse trees is represented
in a chart as a tuple (E, Er, a), where E is a set
of equivalence classes, Er C E is a set of root
nodes, and a : E —� 2ExE is a function to repre-
sent immediate-dominance relations.
Our representation of the chart can be interpreted
as an instance of a feature forest (Miyao and Tsujii,
2002; Geman and Johnson, 2002). A feature for-
est is an “and/or” graph to represent exponentially-
many tree structures in a packed form. If T(s) is
represented in a feature forest, p(tIT(s)) can be esti-
mated using dynamic programming without unpack-
ing the chart. A feature forest is formally defined as
a tuple, (C, D, R, y, b), where C is a set of conjunc-
tive nodes, D is a set of disjunctive nodes, R C_ C
is a set of root nodes2, y : D 2c is a conjunctive
daughter function, and b : C 2D is a disjunctive

The simplest way to map a chart of HPSG parse
trees into a feature forest is to map each equivalence
class e E E to a conjunctive node c E C. How-
ever, in HPSG parsing, important features for dis-
ambiguation are combinations of a mother and its
daughters, i.e., (m, 1, r). Hence, we map the tuple
(eM, el, er), which corresponds to (m, 1, r), into a
conjunctive node.
Figure 2 shows (a part of) the HPSG parse trees
in Figure 1 represented as a feature forest. Square
boxes are conjunctive nodes, dotted lines express a
disjunctive daughter function, and solid arrows rep-
resent a conjunctive daughter function.
The mapping is formally defined as follows.

The above method allows for the tractable estima-
tion of log-linear models on exponentially-many
HPSG parse trees. However, despite the develop-
ment of methods to improve HPSG parsing effi-
ciency (Oepen et al., 2002a), the exhaustive parsing
of all sentences in a treebank is still expensive.
Our idea is that we can omit the computation
of parse trees with low probabilities in the estima-
tion stage because T(s) can be approximated with
parse trees with high probabilities. To achieve this,
we first prepared a preliminary probabilistic model
whose estimation did not require the parsing of a
treebank. The preliminary model was used to reduce
the search space for parsing a training treebank.
The preliminary model in this study is a unigram
model, p(tIs) = FJwEs p(1I w), where w E s is a
word in the sentence s, and 1 is a lexical entry as-
signed to w. This model can be estimated without
parsing a treebank.
Given this model, we restrict the number of lexi-
cal entries used to parse a treebank. With a thresh-
old n for the number of lexical entries and a thresh-
old C for the probability, lexical entries are assigned
to a word in descending order of probability, until
the number of assigned entries exceeds n, or the ac-
cumulated probability exceeds C. If the lexical en-
try necessary to produce the correct parse is not as-
signed, it is additionally assigned to the word.
Figure 3 shows an example of filtering lexical en-
tries assigned to “saw”. With C = 0.95, four lexical
entries are assigned. Although the lexicon includes
other lexical entries, such as a verbal entry taking a
sentential complement (p = 0.01 in the figure), they
are filtered out. This method reduces the time for

bias in the training data and results in lower accu-
racy. The trade-off between the parsing cost and the
accuracy will be examined experimentally.
We have several ways to integrate p with the esti-
mated model p(tIT(s)). In the experiments, we will
empirically compare the following methods in terms
of accuracy and estimation time.
Filtering only The unigram probability p is used
only for filtering.
Product The probability is defined as the product of
p and the estimated model p.
Reference distribution p is used as a reference dis-
tribution of p.
Feature function log is used as a feature function
of p. This method was shown to be a gener-
alization of the reference distribution method
(Johnson and Riezler, 2000).

Feature functions in the log-linear models are de-
signed to capture the characteristics of (er,,,, el, C,).
In this paper, we investigate combinations of the
atomic features listed in Table 1. The following

Figure 4 shows examples: (root is for the root

in which the applied schema is the Head-Modifier
Schema, the left daughter is VP headed by “saw”,
and the right daughter is PP headed by “with”,
whose part-of-speech is IN and the lexical entry is
a VP-modifying preposition.
In an actual implementation, some of the atomic
features are abstracted (i.e., ignored) for smoothing.
Table 2 shows a full set of templates of combined
features used in the experiments. Each row rep-
resents a template of a feature function. A check
means the atomic feature is incorporated while a hy-
phen means the feature is ignored.
Restricting the domain of feature functions to
(cm, Cl, Cr) seems to limit the flexibility of feature
design. Although it is true to some extent, this does
not necessarily mean the impossibility of incorpo-
rating features on nonlocal dependencies into the
model. This is because a feature forest model does
not assume probabilistic independence of conjunc-
tive nodes. This means that we can unpack a part of
the forest without changing the model. Actually, in
our previous study (Miyao et al., 2003), we success-
fully developed a probabilistic model including fea-
tures on nonlocal predicate-argument dependencies.
However, since we could not observe significant im-
provements by incorporating nonlocal features, this
paper investigates only the features described above.

We used an HPSG grammar derived from Penn
Treebank (Marcus et al., 1994) Section 02-21
(39,832 sentences) by our method of grammar de-
velopment (Miyao et al., 2004). The training data
was the HPSG treebank derived from the same por-
tion of the Penn Treebank3. For the training, we
eliminated sentences with no less than 40 words and
for which the parser could not produce the correct
parse. The resulting training set consisted of 33,574
sentences. The treebanks derived from Sections 22
and 23 were used as the development (1,644 sen-
tences) and final test sets (2,299 sentences). We
measured the accuracy of predicate-argument de-
pendencies output by the parser. A dependency is
defined as a tuple (7, wh, a, wa), where 7 is the
predicate type (e.g., adjective, intransitive verb), wy,
is the head word of the predicate, a is the argument
label (MODARG, ARG1, ..., ARG4), and wa is the
head word of the argument. Labeled precision/recall
(LP/LR) is the ratio of tuples correctly identified by
the parser, while unlabeled precision/recall (UP/UR)
is the ratio of wh and wa correctly identified re-
gardless of 7 and a. The F-score is the harmonic
mean of LP and LR. The accuracy was measured by
parsing test sentences with part-of-speech tags pro-

vided by the treebank. The Gaussian prior was used
for smoothing (Chen and Rosenfeld, 1999), and its
hyper-parameter was tuned for each model to max-
imize the F-score for the development set. The op-
timization algorithm was the limited-memory BFGS
method (Nocedal and Wright, 1999). All the follow-
ing experiments were conducted on AMD Opteron
servers with a 2.0-GHz CPU and 12-GB memory.
Table 3 shows the accuracy for the develop-
ment/test sets. Features occurring more than twice
were included in the model (598,326 features). Fil-
tering was done by the reference distribution method
with n = 10 and c = 0.95. The unigram model
for filtering was a log-linear model with two feature
templates, (WORD, POS, LE� and (POS, LE� (24,847
features). Our results cannot be strictly compared
with other grammar formalisms because each for-
malism represents predicate-argument dependencies
differently; for reference, our results are competi-
tive with the corresponding measures reported for
Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) (LP/LR
= 86.6/86.3) (Clark and Curran, 2004b). Different
from the results of CCG and PCFG (Collins, 1999;
Charniak, 2000), the recall was clearly lower than
precision. This results from the HPSG grammar
having stricter feature constraints and the parser not
being able to produce parse results for around one
percent of the sentences. To improve recall, we need
techniques of robust processing with HPSG.

iments, we show the accuracy for the test set (&lt;
40 words) only. Table 4 revealed that our simple
method of filtering caused a fatal bias in training
data when a preliminary distribution was used only
for filtering. However, the model combined with a
preliminary model achieved sufficient accuracy. The
reference distribution method achieved higher accu-
racy and lower cost. The feature function method
achieved lower accuracy in our experiments. A pos-
sible reason is that a hyper-parameter of the prior
was set to the same value for all the features includ-
ing the feature of the preliminary distribution.

ing threshold. We can determine the correlation be-

ferences were slight. In contrast, RULE, SYM, and
LE features did not affect the accuracy. However,
if each of them was removed together with another
feature, the accuracy decreased drastically. This im-
plies that such features had overlapping information.
Table 7 shows the manual classification of the
causes of errors in 100 sentences randomly chosen
from the development set. In our evaluation, one
error source may cause multiple errors of dependen-
cies. For example, if a wrong lexical entry was as-
signed to a verb, all the argument dependencies of
the verb are counted as errors. The numbers in the
table include such double-counting. Major causes
were classified into three types: argument/modifier
distinction, attachment ambiguity, and lexical am-
biguity. While attachment/lexical ambiguities are
well-known causes, the other is peculiar to deep
parsing. Most of the errors cannot be resolved by
features we investigated in this study, and the design
of other features is crucial for further improvements.

Experiments on deep parsing of Penn Treebank have
been reported for Combinatory Categorial Grammar
(CCG) (Clark and Curran, 2004b) and Lexical Func-
tional Grammar (LFG) (Kaplan et al., 2004). They
developed log-linear models on a packed represen-
tation of parse forests, which is similar to our rep-
resentation. Although HPSG exploits further com-
plicated feature constraints and requires high com-
putational cost, our work has proved that log-linear
models can be applied to HPSG parsing and attain
accurate and wide-coverage parsing.
Clark and Curran (2004a) described a method of
reducing the cost of parsing a training treebank in
the context of CCG parsing. They first assigned to
each word a small number of supertags, which cor-
respond to lexical entries in our case, and parsed su-
pertagged sentences. Since they did not mention the
probabilities of supertags, their method corresponds
to our “filtering only” method. However, they also
applied the same supertagger in a parsing stage, and
this seemed to be crucial for high accuracy. This
means that they estimated the probability of produc-
ing a parse tree from a supertagged sentence.
Another approach to estimating log-linear mod-
els for HPSG is to extract a small informative sam-
ple from the original set T (s) (Osborne, 2000).
Malouf and van Noord (2004) successfully applied
this method to German HPSG. The problem with
this method was in the approximation of exponen-
tially many parse trees by a polynomial-size sample.
However, their method has the advantage that any
features on a parse tree can be incorporated into the
model. The trade-off between approximation and lo-
cality of features is an outstanding problem.
Other discriminative classifiers were applied to
the disambiguation in HPSG parsing (Baldridge and
Osborne, 2003; Toutanova et al., 2004). The prob-
lem of exponential explosion is also inevitable for

their methods. An approach similar to ours may be
applied to them, following the study on the learning
of a discriminative classifier for a packed represen-
tation (Taskar et al., 2004).
As discussed in Section 6, exploration of other
features is indispensable to further improvements.
A possible direction is to encode larger contexts of
parse trees, which were shown to improve the accu-
racy (Toutanova and Manning, 2002; Toutanova et
al., 2004). Future work includes the investigation of
such features, as well as the abstraction of lexical
dependencies like semantic classes.

The estimation of log-linear models requires high computational cost, especially with widecoverage grammars. Using techniques to reduce the estimation cost, we trained the models using 20 sections of Penn Treebank. A series of experiments empirically evaluated the estimation techniques, and also examined the performance of the disambiguation models on the parsing of real-world sentences.</abstract>

The feature function fi(t, s) represents the characteristics of t and s, while the corresponding model parameter Ai(t, s) is its weight. Model parameters that maximize the loglikelihood of the training data are computed using a numerical optimization method (Malouf, 2002). Estimation of the above model requires a set of pairs (ts, T (s)), where ts is the correct parse for sentence s. While ts is provided by a treebank, T(s) is computed by parsing each s in the treebank. Previous studies assumed T(s) could be enumerated; however, the assumption is impractical because the size of T(s) is exponentially related to the length of s. The problem of exponential explosion is inevitable in the wide-coverage parsing of real-world texts because many parse candidates are produced to support various constructions in long sentences. 3 Packed representation of HPSG parse tree</context>

Recently, a wide-coverage grammar and a large treebank have become available for English HPSG (Miyao et al., 2004). A large treebank can be used as training and test data for statistical models. Therefore, we now have the basis for the development and the evaluation of statistical disambiguation models for wide-coverage HPSG parsing. The aim of this paper is to report the development of log-linear models for the disambiguation in widecoverage HPSG parsing, and their empirical evaluation through the parsing of the Wall Street Journal of Penn Treebank II (Marcus et al., 1994). This is challenging because the estimation of log-linear models is computationally expensive, and we require solutions to make the model estimation tractable. We apply two techniques for reducing the training cost. One is the estimation on a packed representation of HPSG parse trees (Section 3). The other is the filtering of parse candidates according to a preliminary probability distribution (Section 4). To our knowledge, this work provides the first results of extensive experiments of parsing Penn Treebank with a probabilistic HPSG. The results from the Wall Street Journal are significant </context>

The training data was the HPSG treebank derived from the same portion of the Penn Treebank3.

A check means the atomic feature is incorporated while a hyphen means the feature is ignored. Restricting the domain of feature functions to (cm, Cl, Cr) seems to limit the flexibility of feature design. Although it is true to some extent, this does not necessarily mean the impossibility of incorporating features on nonlocal dependencies into the model. This is because a feature forest model does not assume probabilistic independence of conjunctive nodes. This means that we can unpack a part of the forest without changing the model. Actually, in our previous study (Miyao et al., 2003), we successfully developed a probabilistic model including features on nonlocal predicate-argument dependencies. However, since we could not observe significant improvements by incorporating nonlocal features, this paper investigates only the features described above. 86 RULE DIST COMMA SPAN SYM WORD POS LE � � � � – � � � � � � – – V V – � – V – – V – – � – V – – V – � – � – V – – V V – � �– V V – – – � � � � V V – �– – � � V – – � – � � V – – – – V – – – � – V – V – – – V – – – – – V – – V – V V V V RULE SYM WORD POS LE SYM WORD POS LE � � � � � –� � � – – ��– �– � � – � – �– –�– � – – � � </context>

However, despite research on HPSG processing efficiency (Oepen et al., 2002a), the application of HPSG parsing is still limited to specific domains and short sentences (Oepen et al., 2002b; Toutanova and Manning, 2002). Scaling up HPSG parsing to assess real-world texts is an emerging research field with both theoretical and practical applications. Recently, a wide-coverage grammar and a large treebank have become available for English HPSG (Miyao et al., 2004). A large treebank can be used as training and test data for statistical models. Therefore, we now have the basis for the development and the evaluation of statistical disambiguation models for wide-coverage HPSG parsing. The aim of this paper is to report the development of log-linear models for the disambiguation in widecoverage HPSG parsing, and their empirical evaluation through the parsing of the Wall Street Journal of Penn Treebank II (Marcus et al., 1994). This is challenging because the estimation of log-linear models is computationally expensive, and we require solutions to make the m</context>

The training data was the HPSG treebank derived from the same portion of the Penn Treebank3. For the training, we eliminated sentences with no less than 40 words and for which the parser could not produce the correct parse. The resulting training set consisted of 33,574 sentences. The treebanks derived from Sections 22 and 23 were used as the development (1,644 sentences) and final test sets (2,299 sentences). We measured the accuracy of predicate-argument dependencies output by the parser. A dependency is defined as a tuple (7, wh, a, wa), where 7 is the predicate type (e.g., adjective, int</context>

However, despite the development of methods to improve HPSG parsing efficiency (Oepen et al., 2002a), the exhaustive parsing of all sentences in a treebank is still expensive. Our idea is that we can omit the computation of parse trees with low probabilities in the estimation stage because T(s) can be approximated with parse trees with high probabilities. To achieve this, we first prepared a preliminary probabilistic model whose estimation did not require the parsing of a treebank. The preliminary model was used to reduce the search space for parsing a training treebank. The preliminary model in this study is a unigram model, p(tIs) = FJwEs p(1I w), where w E s is a word in the sentence s,</context>

Since they did not mention the probabilities of supertags, their method corresponds to our “filtering only” method. However, they also applied the same supertagger in a parsing stage, and this seemed to be crucial for high accuracy. This means that they estimated the probability of producing a parse tree from a supertagged sentence. Another approach to estimating log-linear models for HPSG is to extract a small informative sample from the original set T (s) (Osborne, 2000).
