This paper presents a practical machine translation system
based on sentence types for economic news stories.
Conventional English-to-Japanese machine translation
(MT) systems which are rule-based approaches, are diffi-
cult to translate certain types of Associated Press (AP)
wire service news stories, such as economics and sports,
because these topics include many fixed expressions (such
as compound words or collocations) which are difficult to
be processed by conventional syntactic analysis and/or
word selection methods.
The proposed MT system, an economic-news stories
machine translation system (ENTS), can translate eco-
nomic news sentences with fixed expressions. The system
consists of three processes, to handle different types of
sentences, fixed type, economics-specific type and general
type. This paper focuses mainly on the translation method
for fixed-type sentences, which is a kind of example-based
approach. In this translation method, fixed sentence trans-
lation (STRA) data plays a key role. The STRA data is a
set of bilingual templates, which is built automatically
from fixed English sentences and their Japanese transla-
tion equivalents. The fixed English sentences are extracted
automatically from the AP corpus.
A series of experiments to evaluate ENTS using eco-
nomic news in the AP news stories showed the translation
accuracy was about 50 % higher than with our conven-
tional rule-based MT method.

<bodyText confidence="0.985606487804878">
We are developing an English-to-Japanese machine trans-
lation (MT) system to produce real-time rough translations
for Associated Press (AP) wire service news stories. With
some news topics, troubles with fixed expressions lows
the translation accuracy of the MT system. Economic
news stories in particular are difficult to translate by con-
ventional rule-based methods, because they contain many
fixed expressions sharing two major characteristics:
cl) The fixed expressions produce economics-specific
syntactic structure.
c2) Equivalents of the fixed expressions require Japa-
nese economic jargons.
These characteristics respectively cause two major bot-
tlenecks for the conventional rule-based MT system:
bl) General-purpose grammatical rules are not suffi-
cient to yield correct analysis of economic news stories.
(Simple addition of grammatical rules increases syntactic
ambiguities.)
b2) It is difficult to select the appropriate Japanese
words for the translation.
Actually, these problems reduce the translation accu-
racy of our rule-based MT system to only 20%, which is
too low for practical use.
This paper presents a new English-to-Japanese MT sys-
tem for economic news stories, which is called ENTS
(Economic News stories machine Translation System), to
process fixed expressions effectively. ENTS consists of
three sequential processes (as shown in Fig. 1), based on
the three basic types of economic news sentence. Process 1
is a kind of example-based approach, while Processes 2
and 3 are rule-based ones that differ in grammatical rules.
This paper focuses mainly on Process 1, which is com-
posed of fixed sentence translation, compound word trans-
lation, fixed sentence translation data production and fixed
sentence extraction. Fixed sentence translation data
(STRA data), which is a kind of bilingual template, plays
a key role in the fixed sentence translation. The STRA data
is built automatically from fixed English sentences ex-
tracted from a large corpus and their corresponding Japa-
nese translations.

Recently, several example-based MTs were proposed
for processing fixed expressions [Nagao841[Sumita911.
Furuse proposed a cooperative method using tightly
woven combination of example- and rule-based ap-
proaches Furuse92]. In contrast to their approach, we use
the two methods independently. Therefore, the translation
accuracy of our example-based method is guaranteed to be
100%.
</bodyText>
<tableCaption confidence="0.7126895">
Creating an example-based MT requires bilingual trans-
lation data. Kaji proposed acquiring the bilingual transla-
tion data from bilingual texts [Kaji92]. However that
would require a complete syntactic analysis of bilingual
texts. Our method is more robust, because it requires only
a partial analysis.

Section 2 describes some relevant features of economic
news stories. In Section 3, we present an overview of
ENTS. The following sections describe the fixed sentence
translation method in ENTS, and the results of experi-
ments using ENTS for AP economic news stories.

2 Features of economic news sentences
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.924245125">
The AP delivers about 350 wire-service news stories a
day, of which about 50 are concerned with economics.
Each news story has its own title related to the contents.
Because the titles on economic news stories are fixed, such
stories can be selected easily. Most sentences in these
economic news stories have fixed expressions comprised
of compound words and/or collocations.
Example of fixed expressions
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.6169425">

&amp;quot;Malaysian tin closed at&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;The U.S. dollar opened&amp;quot;,
and &amp;quot;as share prices rose&amp;quot;
Based on the fixed expressions, the sentences in eco-
nomic news stories, called economic sentences, are classi-
fied into three types:
</bodyText>
<tableCaption confidence="0.55921">
Type I: Fixed sentences
Example 1
1-1) &amp;quot;In Kuala Lumpur, Malaysian tin closed at 17.76
dollars per kilo, up 5 cents.&amp;quot;
1-2) &amp;quot;In Kuala Lumpur, Malaysian tin closed at 16.83
dollars per kilo, up 19 cents.&amp;quot;
1-3) &amp;quot;In Kuala Lumpur, Malaysian tin closed at 16.40
dollars per kilo, down 8 cents.&amp;quot;
Type II: Economics-specific sentences

prices inched up.&amp;quot;
2-2) &amp;quot;The U.S. dollar drifted lower against the Japanese
yen Wednesday morning, while share prices on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange rose sharply.&amp;quot;
2-3) &amp;quot;The U.S. dollar opened higher against the Japanese
yen in Tokyo Thursday, as share prices rose in early trad-
ing.&amp;quot;

<listItem confidence="0.921268125">
3-1) &amp;quot;Kagawa added, however, that the market still antici-
pates a rising dollar.&amp;quot;
3-2) &amp;quot;Shigeru Sato, an analyst with Sanyo Securities, said
the index fell some 65 points at one point in the afternoon,
but last-minute arbitrage buying pulled it back up.&amp;quot;
3-3) &amp;quot;But Tobo said the market&apos;s basic sentiment remained
bearish because of a lack of incentives to focus on.&amp;quot;
(1) Type I
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.990110125">
The sentences in Type I contain fixed expressions in
which the words change a little form day to day. The parts
of speech of the translation equivalents of these fixed ex-
pressions are nouns in Japanese. For example, the transla-
tion equivalents of compound words like &amp;quot;17.76 dollars
per kilo&amp;quot; are nouns, as are those of &amp;quot;up&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;down&amp;quot;in 1-1,
2, 3. The verb in a Type I sentence, such as &amp;quot;close&amp;quot; in ex-
amples 1-1, 2, 3, is fixed.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.557337">
(2) Type II
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9788602">
Although each sentence in Type II has a unique style with
fixed expressions, there is a greater variety of fixed ex-
pressions than that in Type I sentences. For example:
&amp;quot;opened&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;drifted&amp;quot;
or &amp;quot;slightly higher&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;lower&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;higher&amp;quot;
The parts of speech of their translation equivalents of
these fixed expressions are verb or adjective in Japanese.
Therefore, their translation equivalences require a produc-
tion method of their inflections in Japanese generation
process of MT.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.763582">
(3) Type III

<bodyText confidence="0.942682">
The Type III sentences have no features that make MT
appropriate. Most of the general sentences are dealers&apos;

are few ambiguities in syntactic structure.

Process 3 translates those sentences not processed by
Process 1 or Process 2. It is a rule-based MT with general-
purpose grammatical rules.

<figureCaption confidence="0.987671384615385">
In our translation method, STRA (a fixed Sentence
TRAnslation method), the bilingual templates in which
translation equivalents of the fixed expressions are repre-
sented as variables are created using STRA data. That
data is built automatically by DTRA (a Data production
method for STRA) from fixed English sentences and their
corresponding Japanese translations. The fixed English
sentences are extracted automatically from a corpus by
EXTRA (a fixed sentence EXTRAction method). CTRA
(a Compound word TRAnslation method) plays a main
role in STRA and DTRA.

4.1 Compound word translation (CTRA)
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.56697792">
The compound word translation module (CTRA) trans-
lates compound words in fixed expressions [Katoh91]. In
STRA and DTRA, CTRA is the main processing unit,
while it is used in one step of analysis in Processes 2 and 3.
In our MT system used in Processes 2 and 3, the CTRA
step occurs between morphological and syntactic analyses
as shown in Fig. 4.
CTRA extracts fixed expressions and defines their ap-
propriate translation equivalents, the parts of speech and
the semantic markers. For example, fixed expressions in
example 1-1 are processed as:
idiomatic translation part of semantic
expression equivalents speech marker
&amp;quot;17.76 dollars per kilo&amp;quot; &amp;quot;14017.76 r)i,&amp;quot; noun unit expression
&amp;quot;5 cents&amp;quot; &amp;quot;5 -h•-,1.&amp;quot; noun unit expression
In CTRA, English analysis is done by CHART parser
based on CFG rules which represent fixed expressions.
On the other hand, Japanese generation is not based on a
rule-based method, but conducted by substituting the
translation equivalents of the English words for variables
in Japanese templates. Fig. 5 shows examples of CFG
rules and their corresponding Japanese templates. Both
these CFG rules and Japanese templates are named as
CTRA data.

At the top of the CFG rules in Fig. 6 is an English tem-
plate of example 1-1, and its corresponding translation
with variables is a Japanese template. The CFG rules are
based not on English grammar but on an English sentence
pattern, although they represent the word order of a fixed
sentence. For example, &amp;quot;Malaysian tin closed at&amp;quot;, which is
arranged in one phrase, cannot usually be represented as
one grammatical category according to English grammar.
The STRA data is flexible in its ability to translate fixed
sentences. For example, the STRA data shown in Fig. 6
and the CTRA data in Fig. 5 can translate:

To make STRA data flexible, the words used in fixed
expressions, such as &amp;quot;Kuala Lumpur&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Tokyo&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;cents&amp;quot;
and &amp;quot;yen&amp;quot;, should be registered in CTRA data. These

In STEP 0, a fixed sentence w 1 ...wn is translated into
Japanese by hand. STEP 1 collects candidates for vari-
ables in the Japanese sentence. Actually, the fixed sen-
tence is analyzed by CTRA, and various fixed expressions
are extracted as symbols (pre-terminal or terminal sym-
bols) used in non-active edges. STEP 2 is to calculate the
weights of the symbols by the algorithm shown in Fig. 7 to
select an optimal set of fixed expressions. If the translation
equivalent of a symbol exist in the Japanese equivalent
sentence, its weight is defined according to the number of
words in edges, otherwise it is zero. STEP 3 selects an
optimal set of edges by calculating the maximum in sums
of the weights between positions 0 and n by Dynamic
Programming (DP). STEP 4 produces pre-terminal sym-
bols for the word sequences not selected in STEP 3, and
lines up the symbols in order of their appearance to make
CFG rules. In STEP 5, each translation equivalent of the
edges in the optimal set is replaced with a variable in the
Japanese equivalent sentence to make Japanese templates.
DTRA is illustrated by processing sentence 1-1.

4.4 Fixed sentence extraction (EXTRA)
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998361277777778">
A method of extracting fixed sentences (EXTRA) collects
fixed sentences for DTRA from a corpus using the fixed
pattern ratio (FPR) defined below.
The first step in EXTRA is to extract the fixed-word
sequences which appear in a corpus most frequently, ig-
noring differences of days of the week (e.g., Monday and
Tuesday) and digits (e.g., 123 and 1000). The fixed-word
sequences are not only compound words such as &amp;quot;[DIGIT]
dollars per kilo&amp;quot;(where [DIGIT] denotes digits) and &amp;quot;on
condition of anonymity&amp;quot;, but also some parts of fixed ex-
pressions, such as &amp;quot;said in a&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;condition of anonym-
ity&amp;quot;. The fixed-word sequences are called &amp;quot;fixed patterns&amp;quot;
and the compiled fixed patterns are called &amp;quot;fixed pattern
data&amp;quot;.
Using fixed patterns, FPR is defined as follows:
sum of words in fixed sequences of a sentence
FPR =
the total number of words in a sentence

FPD1, FPD2 and FPD3 are assumed to be in fixed pattern
data. Thus,
The FPR of example 4-1 = 8/8 =1.0, because 4-1 itself is
FPD1.
The FPR of example 4-2 = (4+3)/9 = 0.78, because 4-2
includes FPD2 and FPD3.
Fixed sentences are defined as those with FWR values
above a certain threshold. EXTRA analyze each sentence
in a corpus and extracts the sentences with sufficiently
high FPR as fixed sentences.
EXTRA has three parameters:

P3) 0.8
To satisfy conditions P1 and P2, about 92,000 fixed pat-
terns were collected from AP wire-service news stories
from a two-year period, which include about 1.6 million
sentences. Using these fixed patterns, about 21,000 fixed
sentences were extracted under the condition P3. The ex-
periment was not limited to economic news stories. Ex-
amples of the extracted results are shown in Appendix.
Since most of the sentences are economic ones with many
idiomatic expressions, EXTRA would be a good method
enough to extract fixed sentences.

5.2 Production of STRA data

<bodyText confidence="0.999976571428571">
The 388 most frequently occurring economics-related
fixed sentences were manually sampled from the 21,000
fixed sentences. After manually translating them into
Japanese, STRA data was produced by DTRA.
While most of CFG rules in the STRA data include vari-
ables, a few do not, such as for &amp;quot;Gold prices were mixed.&amp;quot;
The STRA data produced was as simple as:

translation accuracy increases from about 20% with our

6 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999979461538462">
We described our new machine translation system
(ENTS), which is an economics-specific MT system for
processing fixed expressions. We focused mainly on the
method of translating fixed sentences in ENTS. The re-
sults of experiments show that translation accuracy in-
creases from 20% with our conventional MT to 70% with
ENTS. We conclude ENTS will be effective for translat-
ing AP economic news stories into Japanese.
The processing rate in Process 1 will be improved by
increasing CFG rules in CTRA data and by collecting
more fixed sentences and their translation equivalents in
DTRA. Moreover we intend to apply the translation
method to sports and general news stories.

<abstract confidence="0.994408642857143">This paper presents a practical machine translation system based on sentence types for economic news stories. Conventional English-to-Japanese machine translation (MT) systems which are rule-based approaches, are difficult to translate certain types of Associated Press (AP) wire service news stories, such as economics and sports, because these topics include many fixed expressions (such as compound words or collocations) which are difficult to be processed by conventional syntactic analysis and/or word selection methods. The proposed MT system, an economic-news stories machine translation system (ENTS), can translate economic news sentences with fixed expressions. The system consists of three processes, to handle different types of sentences, fixed type, economics-specific type and general type. This paper focuses mainly on the translation method for fixed-type sentences, which is a kind of example-based approach. In this translation method, fixed sentence translation (STRA) data plays a key role. The STRA data is a set of bilingual templates, which is built automatically from fixed English sentences and their Japanese translation equivalents. The fixed English sentences are extracted automatically from the AP corpus. A series of experiments to evaluate ENTS using economic news in the AP news stories showed the translation accuracy was about 50 % higher than with our conventional rule-based MT method.</abstract>
