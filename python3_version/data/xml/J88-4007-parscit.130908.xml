Dretske&apos;s attempted analogies to the metrics of Shannon and
Weaver. The notion of &amp;quot;information pickup&amp;quot; implies a pre-
established harmony of the world and the mind, disregarding the
well-known arbitrariness of language.
5. While Fodor (1986) does gives a cogent criticism of attempts to
locate information &amp;quot;in the world&amp;quot;, the alternative &amp;quot;intentional&amp;quot;
conception that he advocates relies on questionable assumptions
of an &amp;quot;internal code&amp;quot; wherein such information is &amp;quot;encoded&amp;quot;.
The problem, of course, lies in unpacking this metaphor. Falling
into the custom of taking the computational metaphor of mind
literally, he resuscitates our old familiar homunculus (in compu-
tational disguise as the &amp;quot;executive&amp;quot;) to provide a way out of the
problem of node labels being of higher logical type than the
nodes that they label. A simpler resolution follows from Harris&apos;s
recognition that natural language has no separate metalanguage.

8. This work is reported in depth in Harris et al. (in press). These
science languages occupy a place between natural language and
mathematics, the chief difference from the former being that
operator-argument likelihoods are much more strongly defined,
amounting in most cases to simple binary selection rather than a
graded scale. One of the many interesting aspects of this
research is determining empirically the form of argumentation in
science. The logical apparatus of deduction and other forms of
inference are required only for various uses to which language
may be put, rather than being the semantic basis for natural
language, as has sometimes been claimed.
9. This is a refinement of the notion of distributional meaning
developed in, e.g., Harris (1954).

THE COMPUTATIONAL ANALYSIS OF ENGLISH: A
CORPUS-BASED APPROACH

Why is it so remarkable to have a book whose analysis
of language is entirely based on actual writing? Profes-
sors Garside, Leech, and Sampson have the refreshing
view that the analysis of language ought to be based on
real language, and have presented 12 papers resulting
from their studies using the Lancaster-Oslo-Bergen
corpus of a million words of British English. They
present studies of spelling correction, part-of-speech
assignment, parsing, and speech synthesis based on
probability techniques derived from corpus studies. The
methods here work on arbitrary texts and with reason-
able efficiency.
English includes a great variety of constructions that
pose a dilemma for any strict grammar: to include
everything and face great ambiguity, or to be extremely
prescriptive and reject much. The authors solve this
problem by using probabilities to balance both frequent
and infrequent constructions, and to emphasize low-
level simple algorithms over deep interpretation.
For anyone trying to make practical use of text, this
book is extremely enlightening. English is not an infe-
rior substitute for Prolog, and treating it as such is not
only a mismatch, but also unnecessary for many tasks.
The simple use of probabilities can perform many tasks
that at first glance might be thought to require under-
standing. Methods for doing these are explained clearly
in the book.
The most detailed result described is the technique of
tagging, or assigning parts of speech statistically. By
using both the individual probabilities of different parts
of speech for a single word, and the combined proba-
bility of sequences of two parts of speech, tagging can
be done with 96-97% accuracy. This relatively simple
algorithm, relying for performance on statistical data
accumulated over a large sample of English rather than
upon some kind of model of language, is typical of the
results presented in this book. The algorithm runs on
any input, from any subject area, and does a useful job
without claiming to &amp;quot;understand&amp;quot; natural language.
Just as we have learned that computers can play master-
level chess by exhaustive evaluation of all possible
moves, without any grand strategy or even plausible
move selection, it seems that many linguistic tasks do
not require understanding or modeling, but merely
experience, translated into probability data.

Similar discussions apply to parsing. Fifty thousand
words of the corpus have been parsed by hand, and this
has been used to make a table of the relative frequencies
of different syntactic constructions. Assuming that the
correct parse tree is the one ma-de of the most probable
constituents (to greatly oversimplify in the interests of
saving space), a program was written to parse with
about 50% accuracy. Since the preparation of this book,
continuing work by Eric Atwell and Geoffrey Sampson
at Leeds has greatly improved on this figure, using a
simulated annealing technique (see Sampson 1986).
Other chapters of the book discuss the history of
corpora in linguistic research, a defense of probabilistic
methods, a discussion of speech synthesis and an out-
line of a sophisticated spelling corrector. Not much has
been done on speech synthesis, partly becaiise we do
not as yet have good data on the relation between
syntax and prosody. The spelling corrector is aimed at
errors of word selection, i.e., finding words that, al-
though they appear in the dictionary, should not appear
in the particular sentence being studied (e.g., &amp;quot;They
kingdom come, thy will be done&amp;quot;). All these tools
follow the same model: reliance on statistics from the
corpus.
It is a great relief to read a book like this, which is
based on real texts rather than upon the imaginary
language, sharing a few word forms with English, that is
studied at MIT and some other research institutes (see
Postal 1988). It is amazing that computers, which are
distinguished for their ability to deal with vast quantities
of bytes and their incompetence with even simple
patterns and models, have been used in linguistics
primarily for the implementation of complex logical
models. This book is a start on the exploitation of large
database methods for linguistic information. It is re-
markable for the performance of its methods combined
with their simplicity. Unlike many books on linguistics,
it is easy to understand; it makes one think of the
Moliere character who suddenly found out he had been
speaking prose all his life.
I heartily recommend this book to anyone who
wishes to process language for a useful purpose. Other
workers such as John Sinclair (1987) and Yaacov
Choueka (1988) have also used large text databases for
deriving linguistic information. When I was an under-
graduate, one of my professors said that &amp;quot;mathematical
intuition means having seen the problem before.&amp;quot; Sim-
ilarly, there is no substitute in linguistics for knowing
that a particular construction is likely because it has
appeared many times. This book is a testimony to the
superiority of experience over fantasy.

Hirst&apos;s book presents an approach to natural language
interpretation, using as his vehicle a description of the
experimental system he built. It therefore has to be
evaluated as a contribution on how to build NLP
systems from both theoretical and practical points of
view. It also has to be considered for teaching purposes,
since Hirst has vamped up what was originally a thesis
with some pedagogic exposition and test exercises, as
well as a substantial and useful bibliography.
Hirst is very clear about his aims and very honest
about what he has tackled. He presents detail well and
provides excellent summaries, so the essential proper-
ties of his work are well laid out.
His goal was to build an interpretation system that
could handle serious lexical and structural ambiguity,
and handle it in a principled way. His concern is thus
essentially computational; he does not make any claims
for the psycholinguistic relevance of what he is doing,
but he is, on the other hand, willing to exploit psycho-
linguistically derived support for good processing strat-
egies.
The system consists of a syntactic parser, Paragram,
a semantic interpreter, Absity, and two disambiguation
processors: the Polaroid Word (PW) subsystem for
lexical disambiguation and the Semantic Enquiry Desk
for structural disambiguation. The system builds an
explicit meaning representation in the frame language
Frail.
Hirst&apos;s design is motivated by two goals: to allow
processes of different sorts to use different kinds of
information but to interact to construct a sentence
representation; and to do this in the theoretically well-
founded way exemplified by Montague&apos;s work by doing
