In this article we report work on Chinese semantic role labeling, taking advantage of two recently
completed corpora, the Chinese PropBank, a semantically annotated corpus of Chinese verbs, and
the Chinese Nombank, a companion corpus that annotates the predicate–argument structure of
nominalized predicates. Because the semantic role labels are assigned to the constituents in a
parse tree, we first report experiments in which semantic role labels are automatically assigned
to hand-crafted parses in the Chinese Treebank. This gives us a measure of the extent to which se-
mantic role labels can be bootstrapped from the syntactic annotation provided in the treebank. We
then report experiments using automatic parses with decreasing levels of human annotation in
the input to the syntactic parser: parses that use gold-standard segmentation and POS-tagging,
parses that use only gold-standard segmentation, and fully automatic parses. These experiments
gauge how successful semantic role labeling for Chinese can be in more realistic situations. Our
results show that when hand-crafted parses are used, semantic role labeling accuracy for Chinese
is comparable to what has been reported for the state-of-the-art English semantic role labeling
systems trained and tested on the English PropBank, even though the Chinese PropBank is
significantly smaller in size. When an automatic parser is used, however, the accuracy of our
system is significantly lower than the English state of the art. This indicates that an improvement
in Chinese parsing is critical to high-performance semantic role labeling for Chinese.

Semantic role labeling (SRL) is the task of identifying arguments for a predicate and
assigning semantically meaningful labels to them. A semantic role represents a semantic
relation between a predicate and one of its arguments. Typical semantic roles include
agent, patient, source, goal, and so forth, that are core to a predicate, as well as location,
time, manner, cause, and so on, that are peripheral. Such semantic information is im-
portant in answering who, what, when, where, and why questions therefore is crucial to
natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as question-answering (Narayanan and
Harabagiu 2004), information extraction (Surdeanu et al. 2005), summarization (Melli
et al. 2005), and machine translation (Boas 2002). Any NLP task that requires some form
of semantic interpretation could potentially benefit from a high performance semantic
role labeling system.
For an automatic system, a semantic role labeling task involves locating the linguis-
tic units, typically words or phrases, in natural language text that serve as arguments

to a predicate and assigning semantic role labels to them based on the context in which
they occur. Since the seminal work of Gildea and Jurafsky (2002), statistical and machine
learning approaches have been the predominant research paradigm in semantic role
labeling, like most of the subfields in natural language processing and computational
linguistics. A prerequisite for statistical and machine learning approaches to semantic
role labeling is the availability of a significant amount of semantically interpreted
corpora from which automatic systems can learn. The recent activities in semantic role
labeling (Carreras and M`arquez 2004b, 2005; Litkowski 2004) have in large part been
driven by the availability of semantically annotated corpora such as the FrameNet
(Baker, Fillmore, and Lowe 1998), Proposition Bank (Palmer, Gildea, and Kingsbury
2005), and Nombank (Meyers et al. 2004) projects for English; the tectogrammatical layer
annotation of the Prague Dependency Treebank (Sgall, Panevov´a, and Hajiˇcov´a 2004)
for Czech; and the Salsa Project for German (Burchardt et al. 2006). These semantically
annotated corpora not only provide the training and test material for the development
of machine learning systems, but also effectively define semantic role labeling as a task.
PropBank and FrameNet have been the two most widely used corpora in de-
veloping automatic semantic role labeling systems. Although both corpora provide
predicate–argument structure annotation, they use very different semantic role labels,
especially for the core arguments of each predicate. In FrameNet, the semantic roles
of a predicate (called a Lexical Unit (LU)) are organized by semantic frames, which
are conceptual structures that describe a particular situation or event along with their
participants, which are called frame elements (FEs). All LUs in the same semantic frame
share one set of semantic roles. For example, the verbs buy and sell both belong to the
semantic frame Commercial-transaction, which involves a Buyer and Seller exchanging
Money and Goods. In addition to these four core FEs, there are also three Non-Core FEs:
Means, the manner in which the transaction takes place; Rate, the price of payment per
unit of Goods; and Unit, the unit of measure for the Goods. Semantic role labeling based
on FrameNet annotation attempts to identify the syntactic constituents in a sentence
and assign FEs to them (1a). Notice that for any given sentence, not all FEs have to be
realized and they do not have to be realized in the same syntactic position.

Like FrameNet, PropBank also assigns semantic role labels to syntactic constituents
(rather than to the heads in a dependency structure) in a sentence. Unlike FrameNet,
there is no reference ontology like the semantic frame that provides a general set of
semantic roles. Instead, for the core arguments, the PropBank uses a set of predicate-
specific semantic role labels represented by an integer prefixed by Arg: Arg0 through
Arg5. Predicates vary on the number of core arguments they take, but generally the
total number of core arguments does not exceed six. These core arguments are defined
in frame files, with one frame file for each predicate. Within a frame file, the core

arguments are organized by framesets, which are the major senses of a predicate. A new
frameset is postulated only when it takes a different set of core arguments from existing
framesets. In addition to the core arguments, there is also a finite set of roles reserved for
adjunct-like arguments. Each adjunct-like argument is represented as ArgM, indicating
that it is a modifier argument, followed by a secondary tag indicating the type of
modifier. Secondary tags are for semantic information such as location, manner, and
time that are not specific to a particular verb or even a particular class of verbs and
they are defined based on a general set of guidelines. There is thus a dichotomy in
the representation of the semantic roles for the core and peripheral arguments in the
PropBank annotation.
The predicate-specific nature of the PropBank semantic roles is clear when com-
pared with the FrameNet FE. In (1b), for example, the seller is always labeled Seller and
the buyer is always labeled Buyer in the FrameNet annotation whether the predicate
is buy or sell. In contrast, in the PropBank annotation, the buyer is Arg0 when the
predicate is buy and Arg2 when the predicate is sell. Conversely, the seller is Arg0 when
the predicate is sell and Arg2 when the predicate is buy. While FrameNet annotates
the semantic roles of both verbal and nominal predicates, the annotation of PropBank
is limited to verbs, with the nominal predicates annotated in a separate but related
project, the Nombank Project (Meyers et al. 2004). The NomBank Project adopted the
same predicate-specific approach in representing the core arguments of a predicate as
PropBank, with special treatment for noun-specific phenomena such as support verbs.
There is considerable work on English semantic role labeling with both anno-
tation conventions. Gildea and Jurafsky (2002) did their seminal work using data
from FrameNet. The Senseval-3 international competition on semantic role labeling
(Litkowski 2004) also used the FrameNet annotation. There is an even larger body of
work using PropBank because it has a larger amount of annotated data on a well-
established data set, the Penn Treebank (Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz 1993).
Using the standard training and test sets in the Penn Treebank, there has been a
rapid improvement in performance due to the use of more advanced machine-learning
techniques and more informative linguistic features. The performance using automatic
parses on Section 23 of the Penn Treebank has approached 0.81 F-score (Pradhan, Ward
et al. 2005). There have also been two consecutive CoNLL competitions (Carreras and
M`arquez 2004b, 2005) on semantic role labeling using the PropBank data.
Research on Chinese semantic role labeling is still in its infancy. Work on Chinese
semantic role labeling has been scant and sporadic, mostly due to the lack of a pub-
licly available semantically annotated corpus of significant size. Although most of the
machine-learning techniques used in English semantic role labeling are readily trans-
ferable to Chinese, such technological transfer is only possible with similarly annotated
data. To our knowledge, there are only two such data sets, which all used a small
corpus that the authors created on their own. Sun and Jurafsky (2004) did preliminary
work on Chinese semantic role labeling on 10 selected verbs using Support Vector
Machines and reported promising early results.1 Noting that Chinese syntactic parsing
is an especially challenging task, Kwong and T’sou (2005) reformulated semantic role
labeling as a task of detecting and classifying the heads of arguments to avoid the
hard problem of getting the correct text spans for the arguments. In this article, we

semantic role labeling results.

report work on the semantic role labeling of Chinese predicates for both verbs and their
nominalizations, exploiting two recently completed corpora, the Chinese PropBank
(Xue and Palmer 2003), a corpus that annotates the predicate–argument structure of
verbs, and the Chinese NomBank (Xue 2006a), a companion corpus that annotates the
predicate-argument structure of nominalized predicates in Chinese. Both corpora are
built on top of the Chinese Treebank (Xue et al. 2005), in the sense that the semantic role
labels are assigned to constituents in the parse tree.
The Chinese PropBank and Nombank adopted the English PropBank predicate-
specific approach in representing the semantic roles of the core arguments. In the
absence of a Chinese linguistic ontology like the semantic frames developed for the
English FrameNet Project, using the PropBank-style of semantic roles allows faster de-
velopment. The predicate-specific approach of the PropBank annotation builds a solid
foundation for making high-level generalizations in a bottom-up manner, if broader
generalizations are needed. The Chinese PropBank focuses on the context-sensitive
component of the semantic role annotation, using frame files to guide its annotation.
The semantic roles defined in the frame files are for expected arguments, that is, all
possible arguments for each frameset of a predicate. In a particular sentence, an ex-
pected argument may not always be realized, and when it is, it may not always be
realized in the same syntactic position as a result of syntactic alternations (Levin 1993)
or other syntactic processes. In addition, different framesets of a verb take different sets
of arguments that demonstrate different syntactic patterns. Thus, predicate–argument
structure analysis at the PropBank annotation level represents a crucial leap towards
proper representation of semantic structure from the syntactic structure. Should the
need for more general semantic roles arise, these predicate-specific semantic roles can be
mapped (Yi, Loper, and Palmer 2007) to FrameNet-style or even VerbNet-style (Kipper
et al. 2006) labels.
Using the semantic annotation of the Chinese PropBank and NomBank as training
and test material, we were able for the first time to develop a Chinese semantic role
labeling system that is trained and tested on semantically annotated Chinese corpora
of significant sizes. Using parses produced with different levels of automation (a fully
automatic parser, a parser with correct segmentation, a parser with both correct seg-
mentation and POS-tagging, and treebank gold-standard parses), we were able to quan-
tify the impact of different Chinese language processing components on the semantic
analysis of Chinese predicates. Using a Maximum Entropy–based (McCallum 2002)
machine learning system, our experimental results show that just by using the features
reported in the English semantic role labeling literature, our baseline system achieved
a very high accuracy on Chinese verbs when the gold-standard treebank parses are
used. This suggests that these features port very well between English and Chinese.
There is a gradual degradation in semantic role labeling performance with a decreasing
level of human annotation (from gold-standard treebank parses to fully automatic
parses). We were able to achieve a modest improvement with additional features tai-
lored to the Chinese language, bringing the overall accuracy to F1-scores of 0.92 and
0.67, respectively, when using treebank and fully automatic parses. We were able to
achieve a larger improvement on the semantic role labeling of nominalized predicates
by using noun-specific features (F-scores of 0.70 and 0.57, respectively, for treebank
and fully automatic parses), but our results still show that the semantic role labeling
of nominalized predicates is a much more challenging task than that of verbs. This is
partly due to the smaller training set for nominalized predicates, with the number of
nominalized predicates being less than one third of the number of verb instances in
the same corpus. More importantly, the arguments of nominalized predicates have a

much more uneven distribution: Arguments of a nominalized predicate can occur either
inside the NP headed by the predicate or outside when a support verb is present (see
Section 2 for examples). This makes it particularly challenging to determine whether a
constituent in the parse tree is an argument or not. This observation is supported by
the large margin in performance between the semantic role labeling results we achieved
when the constituents are known and unknown.
This article is structured as follows. In Section 2, we discuss the semantic annotation
of the Chinese PropBank and NomBank in greater detail. In Section 3, we describe the
general architecture of our system, focusing on shared components for both verbs and
their nominalizations. In Sections 4 and 5 we present our experiments on verbs and
nouns, respectively. Section 6 discusses related work and Section 7 concludes this article
and discusses future work.

The Chinese PropBank and the Chinese NomBank adopt the descriptive framework of
the English Proposition Bank in which semantic arguments and adjuncts are treated dif-
ferently. The semantic arguments of a predicate are labeled with a contiguous sequence
of integers, in the form of ArgN, where N is an integer between 0 and 5. These labels can
only be interpreted in the context of a specific predicate. In other words, these argument
labels are not meaningful without knowing what the predicate is. In fact, as we will
show later in this section, these numbered labels are meaningful only within a particular
sense of a predicate. In general, like English, a Chinese predicate takes fewer than 6
arguments. The assignment of numbered argument labels is illustrated in Example (2),
where the predicate is the verb irJ- (”investigate”). Its subject ) (”the police”) is
labeled Arg0 and its object M( (”accident”) RA (”cause”) Arg1. The semantic role
labels added to the parse tree are in bold.

adjunct. Unlike the numbered argument labels for semantic arguments, the secondary

tags represent information that is not predicate-specific. For instance, the adverbial
modifiers DD (”right now”) and 4M (”thorough”) in Example (2) are labeled ArgM-
TMP and ArgM-MNR respectively, where the secondary tag TMP indicates a temporal
modifier and MNR indicates manner. The secondary tags are not predicate-specific in
the sense that they are not required by this particular predicate and they are not selective
with regard to the predicate they can occur with. There is a limited set of such secondary
tags that are used in the Chinese PropBank and the Chinese NomBank and the complete
list of such secondary tags is presented in Table 1.
The same approach is taken to annotate the nominalized predicates in the Chinese
NomBank. This is illustrated in Example (3), a close paraphrase of Example (2), where
the nominalized predicate irJ- (”investigation”) takes the same arguments as its verbal
counterpart. V � (”the police”) is again Arg0 and �1 (”toward”) MI (”accident”)
RQ (”cause”), despite its categorial change from a noun phrase to a prepositional
phrase, remains Arg1. There are also two semantic adjuncts: ArgM-TMP DD (”now”)
and ArgM-MNR 4M (”thorough”). It is worth noting, however, that in this particular
case, the nominalized predicate needs a support verb is(I&apos; (”conduct”) to satisfy the
grammatical constraint that there be a verb in the sentence, and it is explicitly marked
as Sup. In addition, despite the categorial change of 4M from adverb to adjective, the
semantic role label remains unchanged. In this sense, the semantic annotation abstracts
away from the underlying syntactic annotation.

Not all occurrences of a nominalized predicate need to be accompanied by a support
verb. In fact, it is often the case that all arguments of a nominalized predicate occur
in a noun phrase headed by the nominalized predicate. For example, in Example (4),

The PropBank-style annotation is designed to account for syntactic variations, that
is, the different ways in which the same predicate–argument structure is realized. In
Examples (2) and (3), we have already seen where essentially the same predicate is real-
ized as a verb or a noun, and its arguments are realized as different syntactic categories
in different syntactic positions. Syntactic variations occur even without the categorial
change of the predicate. Levin (1993) demonstrates extensively how the argument
structure of English verbs can be realized differently through diathesis alternations.
Similar alternations can also be observed in Chinese, and Example (5) shows this:

realizations. The semantic roles or expected arguments can be realized syntactically in
different ways. It should also be pointed out that the line drawn between arguments
and adjuncts here is not based on the obligatory/optional dichotomy. In some cases,
some constituents are clearly arguments but they are also clearly optional. For example,
in the unaccusative (or pseudo-passive) construction, the agent is clearly optional syn-
tactically and it is equally clear that it is an argument. In Example (5a), for example, the
”door-opener” is optional but is clearly an argument.
The Chinese PropBank also adds a coarse-grained sense tag to the predicate. The
senses of a predicate are motivated by the argument structure of this predicate and
are thus an integral part of the predicate–argument structure annotation. Sense disam-
biguation is performed only when different senses of a predicate require different sets of
arguments. For example, the ”evolve” sense of the verb ”AAS” expects five arguments:
The cause of the evolution, which is often not realized, the entity evolving, the starting
point of the evolution, the end point of the evolution, and the range of the evolution.
When it means ”recruit,” two arguments are expected: the recruiter and the entity
recruited. Because each of these senses can be realized in different subcategorization
frames related through syntactic alternations, in the PropBank annotation convention,
these senses are formally called framesets, meaning sets of subcategorization frames
that realize a particular sense. The examples in (6) illustrate two of the framesets
of ”~AS”.

Assuming the availability of a parse tree (either hand-crafted parses in a treebank or
parses generated by an automatic parser) as input, to assign the semantic role labels
described in Section 2 automatically involves first of all identifying which constituents
in the parse tree are semantic arguments to the predicate in question and then assigning
appropriate semantic role labels to them. The predominant approach to the semantic
role labeling task is to formulate it as a classification problem (Pradhan, Ward et al.
2004; Xue and Palmer 2004) that can be solved with machine-learning techniques. One
can imagine a classification task in which each constituent in the parse tree is labeled
either with one of the numbered argument labels (Arg0 through Arg5), or with one
of the semantic adjunct labels ArgM-TMP, ArgM-MNR, and so on, or with the NULL
label, indicating the constituent is neither an argument nor adjunct to the predicate.
This simple formulation of the classification problem is rarely practiced in the semantic
role labeling literature for the simple reason that the majority of the constituents in a
parse tree are generally not related to the predicate in question. For machine-learning
approaches, this means that the negative samples, constituents that are labeled NULL,
would far outweigh the positive samples, constituents that are actual semantic argu-
ments or adjuncts. Such an imbalance would lead to poor performance for machine-
learning systems, so in practice, most semantic role labeling systems work in stages,
which minimally consist of an argument detection stage and an argument classification
stage. Argument detection is generally formulated as a binary classification task that
separates constituents that are arguments or adjuncts to a predicate from those that are
not related to the predicate in question. By lumping together argument and adjunct
labels, the positive and negative sample imbalance is alleviated somewhat. In addition,
it has been shown that argument detection and argument classification need different
sets of features (Xue and Palmer 2004). A system cannot take advantage of this if both
are done in one fell swoop. With a powerful machine-learning algorithm, argument
detection can be done with high accuracy (Hacioglu et al. 2004; Pradhan, Ward et al.
2004), provided that the appropriate features are used.
The positive and negative sample imbalance can only be partially addressed by
having a separate argument detection stage. Even with a binary classification task, the
number of negative samples is still overwhelmingly larger than the positive samples.
In addition, it does not take advantage of the fact that the arguments and adjuncts of a
predicate, verbal or nominalized, are related to the predicate itself in linguistically well-
understood structural configurations. The overwhelming majority of the arguments and
adjuncts are populated along the spine of the parse tree that the predicate projects. A
substantial number of the constituents can be eliminated from further consideration
as negative samples with a high degree of certainty. (See Sections 4.1 and 5.1 for an

evaluation of how effectively the pruning algorithm works for verbs and nouns.) This
was proved to be a successful strategy by Xue and Palmer (2004) for the semantic role
labeling of English verbs; they use a heuristic algorithm to first prune out irrelevant con-
stituents before the remaining candidates are fed into an argument detection algorithm.
This strategy has also been effectively adopted by others (Cohn and Blunsom 2005;
Punyakanok, Roth, and Yih 2005) and is used here. As we will show in later sections, the
pruning algorithm needs to be slightly different for verbal and nominal predicates and
they do not work equally well for all experimental conditions. Generally, the efficacy of
the pruning algorithm correlates with the quality of syntactic parses that the semantic
role labeling system takes as input. That is, it works much better with treebank parses
than with automatic parses. It also works more effectively for verbs than for nouns, the
arguments of which have a more diverse distribution.
Argument classification, which classifies the constituents into a category that corre-
sponds to one of the semantic role labels, is a natural multi-category classification prob-
lem. It has been generally shown in the literature (Pradhan et al. 2003) that it is a good
idea to bias the argument detection stage toward high recall so that reasonably good
candidates can be passed along to the argument classification stage, and this means the
tag set for argument classification also includes the NULL label. Many classification
techniques—SVM (Pradhan, Ward et al. 2004), perceptrons (Carreras and M`arquez
2004a), Maximum Entropy (Xue and Palmer 2004), and so forth—have been successfully
used to solve the semantic role labeling problem. In the work we report here, for both
argument detection and classification tasks, we used a Maximum Entropy classifier with
a tunable Gaussian prior in the Mallet Toolkit (McCallum 2002). The Maximum Entropy
classifier does multi-category classification and thus can be straightforwardly applied
to the problem here. The classifier can be tuned to minimize overfitting by adjusting the
Gaussian prior.
In summary, in our system, the semantic role labeling is done in three stages, as
illustrated in Figure 1: pruning, argument detection, and argument classification.

In this section we report our experiments on the semantic role labeling of Chinese verbs,
using the Chinese PropBank as training and test material. There are two variables in
our experimental settings. The first variable is the level of human annotation in the
syntactic parses that serve as input to our semantic role labeling system. We used parses
that are fully automatic, parses that assume correct segmentation, parses that assume
correct segmentation as well as POS-tagging, and hand-crafted treebank parses. The

tree are arguments. If the constituents are known, the semantic role labeling reduces to
a pure classification problem where each class is one of the semantic role labels. The
semantic role labeling system only needs to determine what the correct semantic role
should be. If it is unknown which constituents are arguments or adjuncts and which
ones are irrelevant to the predicate in question, the system then needs to first figure
out which constituents, out of all the constituents in the parse tree, are arguments to
the predicate and then decide what the correct semantic role labels should be. We did
not experiment with all combinations of these two variables and the known constituent
experiment is only done for treebank parses.
In this section, we start by describing our pruning procedure for verbs in Section
4.1. We then present the features for our experiments on verbs in Section 4.2. In Section
4.3 we briefly describe the parsers we used for our experiments and we discuss our
experimental results in Section 4.4.

Section 3 demonstrated the need for and the feasibility of using a heuristic algorithm
to address the imbalance of positive and negative samples and in this section we show
how this algorithm is implemented for verbal predicates. The algorithm starts from the
predicate that anchors the annotation, and first collects all the syntactic complements
of this predicate, which are represented as sisters to the predicate. It then iteratively
moves one level up to the parent of the current node till it reaches the root of the tree.
At each level, the system tries to determine whether or not that level is a coordination
structure. The system only considers a constituent to be a potential candidate if it is a
modifier or a complement to the current node. In the case of a coordination structure,
the conjunct that the predicate does not occur in and all its children are eliminated as
possible arguments to the predicate in question. Punctuation marks at all levels are
ignored. It is worth pointing out that the functional tags and traces, which would have
been useful for this purpose, are not used to determine the candidates to allow for a fair
comparison between experiments on hand-crafted parses and parses generated by an
automatic parser. Typically, current parsers do not predict functional tags and traces.2 To
use Example (8) as a walk-through example, assuming the predicate we are interested
in is i�J- (”investigate”), the algorithm starts from this predicate and adds the NP
MC (”accident”) 1&apos;.Q (”cause”) to the candidate list because it is a complement to the
predicate. Then it goes one level up to the VP and adds its two sisters, the ADVPs, E
it (”right now”) and 4M (”carefully”) to the candidate list because they are modifiers.
Then the algorithm goes another level up to another VP, and determines that the two
VPs at this level are conjoined by the punctuation mark, and no candidate is added
at this level because it is a coordination structure. The algorithm then goes up to the
highest VP level, and adds its sister, the NP ) (”police”) to the list of candidates. The
algorithm terminates at the highest IP3 level. The candidates collected by this algorithm
are in circles. The nodes traversed are linked by dotted lines.
It is perhaps not surprising that the pruning algorithm works better with treebank
parses than with automatic parses. When the treebank parses are used, our pruning

arguments while pruning out over 93% (258,959 out of 276,734) nodes in the parse trees.
When automatic parses (Maxent segmentation + Bikel parser) are used as input to our
semantic role labeling system, out of 87% of the arguments that have a corresponding
constituent in the parse tree, our pruning algorithm can recall 74% of the arguments
while pruning out over 92% (247,530 out of 267,381) of the nodes in the parses. Our
experiments show that even when the automatic parses are used, the results are far
better when the pruning algorithm is used than when it is not used. If the pruning
algorithm is not used, the recall improves somewhat, but the precision plummets. The
less-than-expected drop in recall when the pruning algorithm is used is perhaps due to
the fact that the arguments that are pruned out also happen to be the hardest for the
semantic role labeling system to get right.

4.2 Features
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999995714285714">
One characteristic of feature-based semantic role modeling is that the feature space is
generally large. This is in contrast with a low-level NLP task such as POS tagging, which
generally has a small feature space. A wide range of features have been shown to be
useful in previous work on semantic role labeling (Gildea and Jurafsky 2002; Pradhan,
Ward et al. 2004; Xue and Palmer 2004) and we suspect that many more will be tested
before the field will settle down to a core set of features. In their preliminary work on
Chinese semantic role labeling, Sun and Jurafsky (2004) successfully ported a number
of the features used in Gildea and Jurafsky (2002) to Chinese. In our experiments we
adapted more features that have been described in recent work on English semantic
role labeling to Chinese. We used a combination of features from Gildea and Jurafsky
(G&amp;J) (2002), Pradhan, Ward et al. (P et al.) (2004), and Xue and Palmer (X&amp;P) (2004),
and these are used as baseline features. In addition, we proposed a set of new features
that used verb class information induced from the frame files of the Chinese PropBank,
as well as features that were designed to exploit the grammatical constructions that

are unique to Chinese, specifically the BA (Bender 2000) and BEI (Huang 1999) con-
structions. We briefly discuss these features and where necessary explain at an intuitive
level why they are useful for semantic role labeling. It has been well-established in
the semantic role labeling literature that features are not equally effective for argument
detection and argument classification (Xue and Palmer 2004). Our experimental results
on Chinese semantic role labeling generally support this observation. The features we
used for the semantic role labeling of verbs are listed below. Features that are marked as
”C” are used only in the argument classification task. Features that are marked as ”D”
are for argument detection only. Features that are used in both argument detection and
argument classification stages are marked as ”C,D”.

<bodyText confidence="0.8468585">
C,D Path to BA and BEI: BA and BEI are function words that impact the order
of the arguments. BA words are a closed set and in the Chinese Treebank
they have the POS tag BA. Similarly, BEI words are also a closed set and
they are POS-tagged SB (for short BEI) and LB (for long BEI).
C,D Verb class: Verb class itself, verb class + head word combination, verb class
+ phrase type combination.
The position feature is useful because constituents receiving a particular semantic
role label may occur in some typical positions. For example, the majority of the adjuncts,
ARGMs, occur before the verb in Chinese. The path feature, defined as the route from the
constituent in focus to the predicate, represents a more ”fine-grained” position. Whereas
the values for the simple position feature are just BEFORE or AFTER, the values for
the path feature can represent syntactic notions like subject or object. For example, a

subject may be represented as ”NPTIPJVPJVV” and an object may be represented as
”VVTVPJNP.” Intuitively, path features are more informative than simple position
features but they are also sparse because they are more specific. The path feature
proves to be particularly effective for the argument detection task, which is perhaps not
unexpected. As we have shown in Section 4.1, the arguments and adjuncts of a predicate
tend to be populated along the spine of a parse tree anchored by the predicate, and this
information is captured very nicely by the path from the predicate to the constituent in
question.
The head word and its part of speech are clearly informative for semantic role
labeling. For example, a noun phrase headed by 1-5-R- (”today”) is very likely to be a
temporal element; so is a prepositional phrase with the head word ;i� (”at”). However,
for prepositional phrases, the preposition is not always the most informative element.
Sometimes the head word of its NP complement is more predictive of the semantic
category. For example, in the prepositional phrase ;i� (”at”) (”Beijing”), the NP
head (”Beijing”) is more telling of the fact that it indicates a location. So for
prepositional phrases we use both the preposition and the head noun as features in our
system. As has been discussed by Sun and Jurafsky, the head word feature also tends
to be sparse, especially given the smaller size of the Chinese Treebank. The chance of
seeing a word in the test data that also occurs in the training data is small. The POS
tag serves as one form of backoff: Constituents headed by words that have the same
part-of-speech are likely to receive the same semantic role labels as well.
The subcat feature, as implemented in previous work (Gildea and Jurafsky 2002), is
defined as the rule that expands the VP dominating the verbal predicate. By definition, it
does not vary with the constituents in a parse tree. In other words, all constituents in the
parse tree share the same subcat feature. To make up for the weakness of this feature, we
implemented another feature called subcat+, which is the syntactic frame feature in Xue
and Palmer (2004). The subcat+ feature heuristically identifies the key NP arguments
for a given predicate, and the feature value of a given constituent is determined by its
position in relation to these NPs and the predicate. In this way this feature varies with
the constituent being classified and it also partially addresses the issue that the semantic
role of one constituent is not independent of other arguments for this predicate.
As we pointed out in Section 2, the argument labels in the PropBank annotation
are verb-specific. Given a head word or phrase type, the system will be more certain
of the semantic role label when it also knows what the predicate is. The same head
word or phrase type may be associated with different semantic role labels for different
predicates. The head word + predicate and the phase type + predicate features are
designed to capture this linguistic intuition. The other type of combination features are
verb class + head word and verb class + phrase type. We will discuss the use of verb
classes as features in detail in Section 4.2.1.
The first-word-in-the-constituent and the phrase label of the left sibling features are
from Pradhan, Ward et al. (2004) and the interested reader is referred to their work for
an explanation of why these are useful features. Because Chinese is a language with
mixed headedness, namely, some phrases are left-headed and some phrases are right-
headed, the first word and last word are a more robust but sloppier way of finding the
head when the head-finding heuristics fail.
Some of the linguistic phenomena that impact the syntactic realization of argument
structures in Chinese are the BA and BEI constructions. In the Chinese Treebank, BA
and BEI represent closed sets of light verbs that take clausal complements. The subject
of the clausal complement of BA tends to be Arg1 instead of Arg0 in a canonical clause
structure. The BEI construction is the Chinese passive construction in which the subject

of the clause headed by BEI is typically Arg1. In order to capture this information, we
added as features the path from the BEI and BA words to the constituent in focus.
BA and BEI are not predicates themselves, so these features are only invoked for the
predicate in the complement clause of the BA and BEI.

setup, as is also the case in most of the work on semantic role labeling, training data and
test data are not divided by verb instances but by the number of articles. As a result,
it is expected that the verb instances are not evenly divided. It is entirely possible that
some verbs can only be found in the training data and others can only be found in the
test data. By our count, there are 4,526 verb types in the training data and 1,038 verb
types in the test data. One hundred seventy-six verb types that occur in the test data are
absent from the training data. Because the semantic role labels are defined with regard
to the individual verbs, this can be a real problem because the model learned in the
training process does not optimally fit with the test data if different verbs are involved.
Fortunately, many verbs have similar argument structures and therefore are annotated
with similar semantic role labels in the Chinese PropBank. For example, verbs like M
�k (”enlarge”), MW (”make more drastic”), M&amp;I (”accelerate”), MN (”strengthen”), M
R (”deepen”), MA (”accelerate”), MIR (”give more weight”), MA (”make higher”) all
take two arguments, a theme that undergoes a change of state and an external force
or agent that brings about the change of state. These verbs are uniformly annotated
and they all have two numbered arguments with Arg0 denoting the cause and Arg1
denoting the theme. It would make sense to group these verbs together into a class and
use this information in the features as has been done for English using VerbNet (Yi,
Loper, and Palmer 2007). Having a membership in a particular class says something
about the predicate–argument structure of a verb. When a verb is absent in the training
data, which is a familiar sparse data problem, the class information may tell the system
how to label the semantic roles of this verb based on its semantic class.
Although to our knowledge no such classification exists for Chinese verbs based on
the predicate–argument structure, a rough classification can be automatically derived
from the frame files, which are created to guide the PropBank annotation. We classified
the verbs along three dimensions: the number of arguments, the number of framesets,
and selected syntactic alternations.
Number of arguments Verbs in the Chinese PropBank can have one to five argu-
ments, with the majority of them having one, two, or three arguments. Verbs with
zero arguments are auxiliary verbs4 like ,0 (”will”), $4P� (”be able to”), A, (”should”),
R (”dare”), a7 (”may”), R (”be willing to”), (”can”), RM (”can”), :A (”must”), NNt
A (”should”), and some other light verbs. Verbs that have five arguments are change of
state verbs like MTS (”lengthen”), MV (”shorten”), PIQ� (”lower”), AA (”increase”),
#f _�k (”enlarge”), M11, (”make smaller”). These verbs generally take as arguments a
theme that undergoes the change of state, the original state, the new state, the range
of the change, and the cause or agent that brings about the change.
Number of framesets A frameset roughly corresponds to a major sense. This infor-
mation is used because it is common that the different framesets of a verb can have
different numbers of arguments. For example, verbs like YA (”balance”) can be used
either as a non-stative verb, in which case it means ”balance,” or a stative verb, in
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.9861625">
4 One could say that the argument of the auxiliary verb is the entire proposition, but in this phase of the
Chinese PropBank, auxiliary verbs are not annotated.

<note confidence="0.480005">

<bodyText confidence="0.970453318181818">
which case it means ”balanced.” When it is used as a non-stative verb, it takes two
arguments, the thing or situation that is balanced and the balancer, the entity that
maintains the balance. When it is used as a stative verb, obviously it only takes a single
argument.
Syntactic alternations We also represent certain types of syntactic alternations. One
salient type of syntactic alternation is the well-known ”subject of intransitive / object
of transitive” alternation described in detail in Levin (1993). Chinese verbs that demon-
strate this alternation pattern include 1;&amp; (”publish”). For example, i$ (”this”) * (CL)
5 (”book”) plays the same semantic role even though it is the subject in ”i$/this */CL
5/book 1; Wpublish T/AS” and the object in ”i$/this */CL 1; Wpublishing
R/house MR/publish T/ASP i$/this */CL 5/book.”
Thus each verb will belong to a class with a symbol representing each of the
three dimensions. For example, a given verb may belong to the class ”C1C2a,” which
means that this verb has two framesets, with the first frameset having one argu-
ment and the second having two arguments. The ”a” in the second frameset repre-
sents a type of syntactic alternation. Forty classes were semi-automatically derived in
this manner.
Such a classification scheme will undoubtedly prove to be linguistically unsophis-
ticated. Verbs that have the same number of arguments may have different types of
arguments, and the current classification system does not pick up these distinctions.
However, our experiments show that even such a simple classification can be used to
provide features that improve the semantic role labeling performance.

4.3 Using Automatic Parses
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99997225">
Previous work (Sun and Jurafsky 2004) on Chinese semantic role labeling uses a
parser that assumes correct (hand-crafted) segmentation. As word segmentation is
a very challenging problem that has attracted a large body of research by itself, it is
still unclear how well semantic role tagging in Chinese can be performed in realistic
situations. In our experiments, we implemented a Maximum Entropy–based parser
similar to Luo (2003). The parser performs Chinese word segmentation, POS tagging,
and parsing in one integrated system. The parser is trained on the Xinhua news and
Broadcast news portion of the Chinese Treebank, which has 498K words. Tested on the
held-out test data, the parser achieved an unlabeled precision and recall of 0.889 and
0.868, respectively, for the combined word segmentation and parsing accuracy. When
the word segmentation is singled out for evaluation, the parser achieved an F-score of
0.969. It is important to point out that these results cannot be directly compared with
most of the results reported in the literature, where correct segmentation is assumed.
In addition, in order to account for the differences in segmentation, each character has
to be treated as a leaf of the parse tree. This is in contrast with word-based parsers
where words are terminals. For comparison purposes, we also used the Bikel parser
(Bikel 2004). Because the Bikel parser assumes segmented sentences as input, we
extracted the segmentation from the output of our parser and fed it into the Bikel
parser. We also experimented with using gold-standard segmentation and POS from
the Chinese Treebank as input to the Bikel parser to measure the effect of segmentation
and POS tagging on the performance on the semantic role labeling. Because semantic
role labeling is performed on the output of a syntactic parser, only constituents in the
parse tree are candidates. If there is no constituent in the parse tree that shares the same
text span with an argument in the manual annotation, the system cannot possibly get

4.4.1 Data. In all our experiments we use the Chinese Proposition Bank Version 1.0.5 This
version of the Chinese PropBank (Xue and Palmer 2003) consists of standoff annotation
on the first 760 articles (chtb_001.fid to chtb_931.fid) of the Chinese Treebank. This
chunk of the data has 250K words and 10,364 sentences. The total number of verb
types in this chunk of the data is 4,854.6 Following the convention of the English
semantic role labeling experiments, we divide the training and test data by the number
of articles, not by the verb instances. For all our experiments on semantic role labeling
of verbs, 72 files (chtb_001.fid to chtb_040.fid and chtb_900.fid to chtb_931.fid)
are held out as test data,7 40 files (chtb_041.fid to chtb_080.fid) are used as devel-
opment set, and the remaining 648 files (chtb_081.fidto chtb_899.fid) are used as
training data. The training, development, and test sets have 30,280; 1,971; and 3,454
propositions, respectively. Our parser is trained on the training and development set
plus 275K words of broadcast news that have been recently annotated as part of the
Chinese Treebank Project.8 That is, in addition to the training data for the semantic
role labeling experiments, it also uses a portion of the treebank which has not yet been
propbanked.

role tagger has to use automatically produced constituent boundaries either from a
parser or by some other means, but experiments with hand-crafted parses will help us
evaluate how much of a challenge it is to map a syntactic representation to a semantic
representation, which may very well vary from language to language. When hand-
crafted parses in the Chinese Treebank are used as input, our system achieved an
F-score of 0.92 for combined argument detection and classification. This accuracy is
achieved when the new features are added. Without the new features, the accuracy
drops about one percentage point. When the arguments are known, the accuracy is
at 94.1% when the new features are used, up one percentage point from the baseline.
This accuracy is fairly high considering the fact that the state-of-the-art for semantic
role labeling systems trained on the English PropBank (Palmer, Gildea, and Kingsbury
2005) is about 93% percent (Pradhan, Ward et al. 2004; Xue and Palmer 2004) when
the arguments are known and the English PropBank is a much larger corpus that has
one million words. The high baseline accuracy also suggests that the features used
for the English semantic role labeling port very well to Chinese. In addition, there are
several facilitating factors for Chinese semantic role labeling when hand-crafted parses
are provided as input. First of all, Chinese verbs appear to be less polysemous, at least
the ones that occur in the Chinese Treebank. Of the 4,854 verbs in this version of the
Chinese Proposition bank, only 62 verbs have three or more framesets. In contrast, 294
verbs out of the 3,300 verbs in the Penn English PropBank have three or more framesets.
When a verb is less polysemous, the arguments of the verb tend to be realized in a more
uniform manner in syntax. As a result, the argument labels are easier to predict from
their structure. Chinese seems to compensate for this fact by using a larger number of
verbs. This becomes obvious when we consider the fact that the 4,854 verbs are from
just 250K words and the 3,300 verbs in the English PropBank are from one million
words. A related fact is that adjectives in Chinese are traditionally counted as verbs
and they generally have only one argument with a much simpler syntactic realization.
For example, f� (”inexpensive”) and X (”thin”) are considered stative verbs in the
Chinese Treebank.
We also believe that a more subtle explanation for the higher semantic role labeling
accuracy given the annotation of the Chinese Treebank is the fact that the Chinese
Treebank has richer structure (see Xue et al. [2005] for a comparison of the Penn English
Treebank and the Chinese Treebank). By using less flat and more hierarchical structures,
the Chinese Treebank resolves some of the attachment ambiguities that impair semantic
role labeling. For example, the complement and adjunct in a VP in the Chinese Treebank
are attached in different syntactic configurations with regard to the verb. Because com-
plements are generally numbered arguments and adjuncts are generally ARGMs, the
semantic role labeler can take advantage of this information when it tries to determine
when a constituent is a numbered argument or an adjunct.
This apparent advantage in Chinese semantic role labeling is diminished when an
automatic parser is used. First of all, the hierarchical structures in the hand-crafted
parses that aid semantic role labeling are hard to recover with an automatic parser.
Resolving the many attachment ambiguities caused by the hierarchical structures in
language is one of the most difficult problems in the parsing literature. Parsing Chinese
in a realistic scenario is especially difficult given that it has to build structures from
characters rather than words, and Chinese also has few morphological clues to help in
making parsing decisions. Our results show that the semantic role labeling accuracy
improves by 2.1% in F-score when the correct segmentation is used as input to the Bikel
parser. When the correct POS tags are used, the semantic role labeling accuracy im-
proves another 3%. At present, improvement in Chinese parsing is also hindered by the

smaller training set. Although the Chinese Treebank 5.1 has a decent size of 500K words,
it consists of data from very different sources. Due to their very different styles, training
on one portion of the data does not help or may even hurt the parsing accuracy on the
other portion (see Bikel [2004] for a discussion of this issue). The situation improves
somewhat with the addition of the 275K words from broadcast news,9 which leads to
an improvement in parsing accuracy. We believe further improvement in semantic role
labeling accuracy will be to a large extent contingent on the parsing accuracy, which
requires more training materials that are similar in style.

5. Semantic Role Labeling of Nominalized Predicates
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999988666666667">
In this section, we describe our experiments on nominalized predicates in Chinese,
using the Chinese NomBank as training and test data. In Section 5.1 we show that
the pruning algorithm for nominalized predicates needs to account for two disjoint
cases. When a support verb is present, the pruning algorithm needs to go outside
the NP headed by the predicate to search for potential arguments. When there is no
support verb, the arguments can generally be found inside the NP headed by the
predicate. In Section 5.2, we describe the features used in the semantic role labeling of
nominalized predicates. There are three groups of features: features used in the semantic
role labeling of verbs minus a few features that do not carry over to nouns, features
used for verbs that need to be substantially adapted, and new features we designed
specifically for nominalized predicates. The experiments we conducted on nominalized
predicates largely parallel those of verbs, for an easier comparison. Again there are
two experimental variables, the level of human annotation in the input to the semantic
role labeling system and whether the constituents for the arguments are known. The
experimental results are presented in Section 5.3.

5.1 Pruning for Nominalizations

<bodyText confidence="0.999963625">
Like verbal predicates, the arguments and adjuncts of a nominalized predicate are
related to the predicate itself in linguistically well-understood structural configurations.
As we pointed out in Section 2, most of the arguments for nominalized predicates are
inside the NP headed by the predicate unless the NP is the object of a support verb, in
which case its arguments can occur outside the NP. Typically the subject of the support
verb is also an argument of the nominalized predicate, as illustrated in Example (3).
The majority of the constituents are not related to the predicate in question, especially
because the sentences in the treebank tend to be very long. There are two distinct cases
that need to be handled differently, depending on the presence or absence of a support
verb for the nominalized predicate. When the nominalized predicate does not occur
with a support verb, generally all of its arguments are realized within the NP of which
it is the head. The pruning algorithm starts from the predicate, collects its sisters, and
adds them to the candidate list. It then iteratively goes up one level and collects the
sisters of that constituent until it reaches the top-level NP of which it is the head. An
exception is made when the constituent is DNP, in which case the candidate added is
the first daughter of the DNP, not the DNP itself. This is illustrated in Example (9),

where the algorithm starts from the nominalized predicate Ar, RN (”investigation”), and,
because it does not have any sisters, it does not add anything to the candidate list at
this level. It then goes up to its parent NP, and collects its sisters NP ( ) ”police”)
and DNP (~ ”toward” ( ”accident” RA ”cause” RAJ ”DE”). In the case of DNP, the
candidate added is actually its first daughter, the PP.

”The police investigation of the cause of the accident has ended.”
When a nominalized predicate occurs with a support verb, the NP headed by the
nominalized predicate is generally the object of the support verb. Arguments can often
be found both inside and outside this object NP. The pruning algorithm starts from
the nominalized predicate and collects its sisters. It then iteratively goes one level up
until it reaches the top-level IP node. At each level, the sisters of the current node are
added to the list of candidates. Note that the algorithm does not stop at the top NP
level, so that arguments outside the NP can also be captured. In practice, it is generally
not known to the algorithm whether the governing verb, the verb that takes the NP
headed by the nominalized predicate as object, is a support verb or not. Support verbs
are often light verbs and they are only a subset of all governing verbs. The system simply
assumes that all verbs taking the NP headed by a nominalized predicate as its object are
support verbs, adds constituents outside the NP as candidates, and lets the machine-
learning algorithm figure out whether they are arguments or not. This pruning process
is illustrated in Example (10), where the algorithm starts from the nominalized predicate
Ar, RN (”investigation”). It first collects its sister ADJP (4M ”thorough”), and then it will
go one level up to the NP, and adds the support verb (iaT ”conduct”) to the candidate
list. It will go another level up to the VP and adds its sisters ADVP (00 ”now”) and
PP (~ ”toward” MC ”accident” RQ ”cause”) to the candidate list. It then goes one
more level up and decides this is a coordination structure; no candidate is added at this
level. At the next VP level it adds ) (”police”) to the list of candidates. The algorithm
terminates at the IP node.

Overall, pruning works less effectively for nouns than for verbs. When treebank
parses are used, our pruning algorithm can recall over 94% of the arguments while
pruning out 93% (87,724 out of 93,916) of the nodes. When automatic parses (maxent
segmentation + Bikel parser) are used, our pruning algorithm can recall 73% of the
arguments out of the 88% of arguments that have a constituent in the parse tree, while
pruning out 93% (85,160 out of 91,356) of the nodes. However, although there is a small
drop in recall (from 0.569 to 0.529) compared with when the pruning algorithm is not
used, there is a huge gain in precision (from 0.146 to 0.623), a similar trend to that which
we have observed for the semantic role labeling of verbs.

5.2 Features
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999807933333333">
The features we use for the semantic role labeling of nominalized predicates fall into
three groups. The baseline features we used are the same features we used for the
semantic role labeling of verbs. The second group of features are adapted from features
used in the semantic role labeling of verbs. In particular, the path feature is redefined
in the semantic role labeling of nominalized predicates. A significant number of NPs in
the Chinese Treebank are flat and they consist of a sequence of nouns. When there are
nouns on both sides of a predicate, which is a noun itself, the path from the predicate
to the preceding or following noun has the same value. However, the preceding and
following nouns do not have the same probability of being an argument. We therefore
need to clearly mark the position of the predicate (e.g, P=NNTNPINN is not the same
as NNTNPINN=P). Such a problem does not exist for the semantic role labeling of
verbs because their arguments are rarely a verb as well. The third group of features
are new features we added specifically for the semantic role labeling of nominalized
predicates. Like the features for the semantic role labeling of verbal predicates, the
features for argument detection only are marked as ”D” and the features for argument

Several features that we used for the semantic role labeling of verbal predicates were
dropped from our experiments with nominalized predicates. Specifically, the subcat
feature and subcat+ features were not used because it is not clear how these features
can be defined for a nominalized predicate. A couple of new features were added
to the feature set for semantic role labeling of nominalized predicates. As we have
demonstrated in Section 5.1, a support verb to a large extent determines whether or

not the arguments of a nominalized predicate can occur outside the NP of which it
is the head. Therefore it is effective information for discriminating arguments from
non-arguments. It is also indicative of the specific semantic role of an argument in the
argument classification task. To capture this observation, we used a combined feature of
path + governing verb that was only invoked when there was an intervening governing
verb between the constituent being classified and the predicate. The governing verb
is used as an approximation of the support verb for this feature because the system
does not have prior knowledge of whether a verb is a support verb or not absent some
external resource that provides a list of possible support verbs. The governing verb, on
the other hand, can be approximated by looking at the syntactic configuration between
the nominalized predicate and the verb. This feature is used for both argument detection
and argument classification. Another feature we specifically used for the semantic role
labeling of nominalized predicates is the sisterhood feature. When looking at the data,
we found a substantial number of NPs headed by a nominalized predicate have a flat
structure with their sisters as their arguments. The sisterhood feature is designed to
capture this observation and it is also used for both argument detection and argument
classification. The other three new features were used for argument detection only.
When a nominalized predicate is in the subject position, the NP in the topic position
tends to be its argument. A binary feature is invoked when the constituent in focus is
an NP that is the left sister of the subject NP headed by the predicate. Whether an NP is
a subject is also determined heuristically: An NP is considered to be subject if its parent
is an IP and its right sister is a VP. Another binary feature used for argument detection
is whether the constituent in focus is inside the NP headed by the predicate. Finally, the
position of the constituent in relation to the support verb is also used as a feature for
argument detection. The value for this feature can be before or after the support verb,
or it can be the support verb itself.

5.3.1 Data. Our system is trained and tested on a pre-release version of the Chinese
NomBank. This version of the Chinese NomBank consists of standoff annotation on
the first 760 articles (chtb_001.fid to chtb_931.fid) of the Chinese Treebank. This
is the same chunk of treebank data as used in our experiments on verbs. It has 1,227
nominalized predicate types and 10,497 nominalized predicate instances, in comparison
with the 4,854 verb predicate types and 37,183 verb predicate instances in the same
chunk of data. By instance, the NomBank is between a quarter and one third of the
size of the Chinese PropBank. Similarly to our experiments on verbs, we divide the
training, development, and test data by the number of articles, not by the predicate
instances. For all our experiments, we used the same data split as that of the verbs: 648
files (chtb_081.fid to chtb_899.fid) are used as training data, 40 files (chtb_041.fid
to chtb_080.fid) are used as development data, and the other 72 files (chtb_001.fid to
chtb_040.fid and chtb_900.fid to chtb_931.fid) are held out as test data. The same
parsers are used for the semantic role labeling experiments for verbs and nouns.
5.3.2 Results and Discussion. Parallel to our experiments on verbs, we also present
experiments using hand-crafted and automatic parses. The experimental results are
presented in Table 3, which represents an improvement from what has been reported
in Xue (2006b). The baseline results are obtained using the subset of features used in the
semantic role labeling of verbs, minus the subcat and subcat+ features. We also report
improved results by using additional new features and adapting the path feature. The

use of adapted and new features leads to significant improvement in all experiment
settings except when the constituents are already known and treebank parses are used.
This is not surprising given that more new features were added to the argument detec-
tion task than the argument classification task.
Compared with the 94.1% for verbal predicates on the same data, the 84.3% the
system achieved for nominalized predicates on treebank parses when the constituents
are given is considerably lower, suggesting that the semantic role labeling for nominal-
ized predicates is a much more challenging task. The difference between the semantic
role labeling accuracy for verbal and nominalized predicates is even greater when the
constituents are not given and the system has to identify the arguments to be classified.
Our system achieves an F-score of 0.696 when treebank parses are used, and this is
in contrast with the F-score of 0.92 for verbal predicates under similar experimental
conditions.
For our experiments using automatic parses, we used the same parsers for nomi-
nalized and verbal predicates. The first parser is the character-based Maximum Entropy
parser that we developed in-house; and it does word segmentation, POS-tagging, and
syntactic parsing in one integrated system. The second parser is the Bikel parser that
takes three different kinds of input. In its fully automatic mode, it uses the segmentation
extracted from the output of our Maxent parser. We also experimented with using
correct segmentation and correct segmentation plus correct POS-tagging as input to
the Bikel parser to measure the degradation in performance with decreasing levels of
human annotation. Our results show that the Bikel parser outperforms our Maxent
parser 0.028 (F-score) in semantic role labeling accuracy when using fully automatic
parses. When the Bikel parser is used, the system achieves an F-score of 0.573, in com-
parison with the 0.547 achieved by the Maxent parser. There is a gradual degradation in
performance with less human annotation, consistent with our experiments on verbs. It is
somewhat surprising that the segmentation does not affect the semantic role labeling for
nominalized predicates as it does for verbs. Using correct POS tags as input to the Bikel
parser, however, leads to a significant improvement of 0.028 in F-score over using correct
segmentation only, from 0.576 to 0.604. Overall, there is a smaller gap between when
treebank parses are used and when automatic parses are used. There are two possible
explanations. One is that the NP structures are more local and less prone to parsing
errors, so there is less of a difference between treebank and automatic parses. This is

consistent with the fact that 88% of the arguments for nominalized predicates were
recovered by the parser, in contrast with the 87% of the arguments for verbal predicates.
Another possible explanation is that argument detection is challenging even with gold-
standard treebank parses, which makes the gap between treebank and automatic parses
smaller.

nalized predicates warrants a closer examination. One thing we looked at is the fact
that arguments of nominalized predicates can occur either inside or outside the NP
headed by the predicate. Of the 1,124 predicate instances in the test data, 331 of them
have arguments that occur outside the NP headed by the predicate. The remaining 793
instances have all their arguments inside the NP. We found a significant difference in
the semantic role labeling accuracy for the two types of predicates in the experiment
setting where the input to the semantic role labeling system is treebank parses and the
constituents are unknown. For the predicates that have arguments outside the NP, the
system achieved a precision and recall of 0.868 and 0.633, respectively. For the predicates
that have all their arguments inside the NP, the precision and recall are 0.661 and 0.695,
respectively. We believe the large difference in precision is the result of the system
erroneously identifying arguments outside the NP when the predicate heads an NP
that is the object of a verb, even if the verb is not a support verb. With a small data set,
there is insufficient training data for the system to tell whether or not a verb is a support
verb that licenses arguments outside the NP headed by the predicate. We also examined
cases where the predicate heads an NP that is the head of a relative clause. Because the
NP headed by the predicate is semantically associated with a trace inside the relative
clause, its arguments can generally be found inside the relative clause. Out of the 1,124
predicate instances, 138 are the heads of relative clauses. The precision and recall for
these predicates are 0.668 and 0.5, respectively, in comparison with the 0.749 and 0.696
for predicates that are not the head of a relative clause. The much lower recall suggests
the arguments for the head of a relative clause are much harder to identify.

Computational approaches to semantic interpretation have a long tradition, but the
line of research that this work follows is relatively young. Gildea and Jurafsky (2002)
provided the seminal work on the semantic role labeling, using the FrameNet corpus
as training and test material. Since then, there has been rapid improvement in the se-
mantic role labeling accuracy of English verbs, fueled by the development of PropBank
(Palmer, Gildea, and Kingsbury 2005), which annotates the verbs in the one-million-
word Penn Treebank with semantic role labels. A wide range of statistical and machine
learning techniques have been applied to the semantic role labeling of verbs, using
PropBank as training and test material. The machine-learning techniques used include
Support Vector Machines (Pradhan, Ward et al. 2004; Tsai et al. 2005), Maximum Entropy
(Xue and Palmer 2004; Haghighi, Toutanova, and Manning 2005; Liu et al. 2005; Yi
and Palmer 2005), Conditional Random Fields (Cohn and Blunsom 2005), and many
others. Because semantic role labeling is a complex task based on a wide range of
lower level natural language techniques, many different preprocessing, integration, and
combination techniques have been explored. The relative merits of using a full syntactic
parser that provides hierarchical structures (Xue and Palmer 2004) vs. a shallow chunker
(Pradhan, Hacioglu et al. 2005; Hacioglu et al. 2004) has been studied extensively.

role labeling stage, Yi and Palmer (2005) experimented with integrating semantic role
labeling with a Maximum Entropy-based parser, effectively treating semantic role labels
as function tags on the constituents in a parse tree. Koomen et al. (2005), Pradhan, Ward
et al. (2005), M`arquez et al. (2005), and Tsai et al. (2005) pursued alternative approaches
to make their semantic role labeling systems more robust by combining the output of
multiple systems. Punyakanok, Roth, and Yi (2005), in particular, achieved the best per-
formance (F1 = 0.794) on the WSJ test set in the 2005 CoNLL shared task by combining
multiple semantic role labeling systems using an integer linear programming technique
(Punyakanok et al. 2004). Pradhan, Hacioglu et al. (2005) reported the best result (F1 =
0.684) on the Brown test set using the WSJ data as the training set by combining the
output of different semantic role labeling classifiers using a chunking procedure. They
also reported the state-of-the-art result (F1 = 0.81) on the standard PropBank test set,
using the same techniques. Most of the early systems consider each argument on its
own when assigning the semantic role labels, allowing the theoretical possibility that
more than one core argument may share the same semantic role label, violating the
linguistic constraint that the same semantic role label cannot be assigned to more than
one core argument. Toutanova, Haghighi, and Manning (2005) address this by using a
joint-learning strategy to rule out such conflicting argument labels.
The semantic role labeling performance on the FrameNet data set has also
improved significantly from Gildea and Jurafsky’s (2002) early results, thanks mostly
to the Senseval-3 semantic role labeling competition (Litkowski 2004). Participants of
Senseval-3 have used a variety of machine learning algorithms to tackle the semantic
role labeling problem: Maximum Entropy (Baldewein et al. 2004; Ngai et al. 2004;
Kwon, Fleischman, and Hovy 2004); Boosting, SNOW, and Decision Lists (Ngai et al.
2004); SVM (Bejan et al. 2004; Moldovan et al. 2004; Ngai et al. 2004); Memory-based
learning (Baldewein et al. 2004), as well as Generative models (Thompson, Patwardhan,
and Arnold 2004). Bejan et al. (2004) achieved the best result using an SVM classifier
combined with improved linguistic features. They achieved an F1 measure of 0.763 in
their internal evaluation, and 0.831 using the more lenient official Senseval-3 scorer.
Compared with the large body of work on the semantic role labeling on verbs, the
argument structure analysis of nominal predicates has so far received less attention.
Jiang and Ng (2006) reports a semantic role labeling system on nominal predicates,
also using the maximum entropy approach. Their system achieves F1 scores of 0.727
and 0.691, respectively, on gold-standard and automatic parses, indicating semantic role
labeling of nominal predicates is a much more difficult problem than that of verbs for
English as well. Outside the narrow domain of semantic role labeling, there has been a
steady accumulation of work on semantic analysis of nouns and a gradual expansion
of the domain in which the semantic analysis is performed. Lapata (2002) developed a
probabilistic model for the interpretation of nominalizations, focusing on the semantic
relation between the noun head and its prenominal modifier in a nominalized com-
pound (i.e., whether the prenominal modifier is an underlying subject or direct object of
the verb from which the nominalized head is derived). Their model achieved a very high
accuracy of 0.861 when evaluated on data extracted from the British National Corpus.
Girju et al. (2004) and Moldovan and Badulescu (2005) extended the domain of linguistic
analysis to that of noun phrases. In particular, they focused on the study of four nominal
constructions: complex nominals in which a head noun is modified by other nouns
or adjectives derived from nouns, genitives, adjective phrases, and adjective clauses.
In general, previous work on nominals, perhaps with the exception of Nakov and
Hearst (2006) all attempt to specify a finite set of semantic relations between the nouns
and their modifiers in the spirit of Levi (1979). The PropBank/NomBank approach to

semantic role labeling adopted here represents a departure from this tradition in that
the semantic relations in PropBank and NomBank are predicate-specific. There is no
serious attempt to induce cross-predicate semantic relations. In addition, the semantic
relations represented by the PropBank/NomBank semantic roles are not pairwise rela-
tions between the predicate and one of its arguments as they are in previous work. A
third difference is that the arguments of a nominalized predicate can be found outside
the noun phrase headed by the predicate (Meyers, Reeves, and Macleod 2004; Meyers
et al. 2004), making argument identification a much more challenging task. Whereas the
English NomBank annotates both relational nouns and nominalizations, the Chinese
NomBank only deals with nominalization, making it a more coherent task.
Work on Chinese semantic role labeling is still in its infancy. Lacking a Chinese cor-
pus annotated with semantic roles, the few prior works generally relied on annotating
a small corpus for their experiments. Sun and Jurasfky (2004) did preliminary work on
the semantic role labeling of Chinese verbs by annotating 10 selected verbs that have a
frequency ranging from 41 to 230, using the Chinese PropBank annotation guidelines.
Pradhan, Sun et al. (2004) extended that work to Chinese nominalizations, and reported
preliminary work for analyzing the predicate–argument structure of 630 propositions
for 22 nominalizations taken from the Chinese Treebank. Noting the difficulty of
Chinese parsing, Kwong and T’sou (2005) approached the semantic role labeling task
as one of identifying and labeling the head word of the arguments. They annotated
the semantic roles for 41 verbs in 980 sentences in a primary school textbook corpus
and the same verbs in 2,122 sentences in a news corpus. Perhaps not surprisingly, they
reported F1 scores of 0.529 and 0.444, respectively, for the textbook and news corpora
when training and test data are from the same corpus, and 0.463 and 0.398, respectively,
when the training and test data are from different corpora. As far as we know, the
work reported here is the first to use sizable Chinese semantically annotated corpora.
The approach adopted in the present work emphasizes the integration of linguistically
informed heuristics and machine-learning approaches, and the exploration of the un-
derlining linguistic insights behind the features used in machine-learning systems. We
believe semantic role labeling provides an ideal stage where linguistic observations can
be formalized as features and fed into a general machine-learning framework for testing
and verification and natural language technologies can be advanced in the process.

7. Conclusions and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999285">
We have presented the first experimental results on Chinese semantic role labeling using
the Chinese PropBank and the Chinese NomBank. We have shown that given gold-
standard parses, Chinese semantic role labeling can be performed with considerable
accuracy on Chinese verbs. In fact, even though the Chinese PropBank is a significantly
smaller corpus than the English PropBank, we achieved results that are comparable
with the state-of-the-art English semantic role labeling systems. We suggest three factors
that are particularly conducive to the semantic role labeling of Chinese verbs when
the hand-crafted treebank parses are used as input. One is that Chinese verbs tend
to be less polysemous compared with English, which contributes to a more uniform
mapping between the predicate–argument structure and its syntactic realization. An-
other facilitating factor is that stative verbs, which generally translate into adjectives in
English, account for a large proportion of all the verbs in the Chinese PropBank and they
tend to have simple argument structures. Finally, we suggest that the richer structure
in the Chinese Treebank makes certain aspects of the semantic role labeling simpler.

One such example is that the clear structural distinction between syntactic arguments
and adjuncts makes it easier for the semantic role labeling system to differentiate core
arguments and adjuncts for Chinese verbs. These all translate into lower confusability
along the lines of Erk and Pad´o (2005) in the mapping from the syntactic structure to
the semantic role labels.
When the semantic role labeling takes raw text as input, it cannot take advantage
of the rich syntactic structure of the treebank unless it can be reproduced with high
accuracy by an automatic parser. Even though our experiments using fully automatic
parses yield promising initial results, the accuracy is significantly lower than the English
state of the art. Our parsing accuracy is hampered by a significantly smaller training set
that is only half the size of the Penn Treebank. We also suggest that there are a few
inherent linguistic properties of the Chinese language that make syntactic parsing a
particularly challenging task. The first has to do with the fact that Chinese text does
not come with word boundaries and our parser has to build structures from characters
rather than words. The second has to do with the fact that Chinese has very little
inflectional morphology that the parser can exploit when deciding the part-of-speech
tags of the words. Both word segmentation and POS-tagging difficulties will lead to
parsing errors when larger phrase structures are built.
Our experimental results also show a substantial gap between system performance
on verbs and nominalized predicates. This difference can be partially attributed to the
smaller corpus size of the Chinese Nombank, with fewer instances of nominalized
predicates than verbs in the underlying Chinese Treebank, but we believe the main
reason is that the semantic role labeling is more challenging for nominalized predicates
than for verbs. This again can be explained in terms of confusability in the mapping
from syntactic structure to the predicate–argument structure. In general, the NPs in the
Chinese Treebank have flatter structures compared with verbs. For example, there is no
clear structural distinction between arguments and adjuncts for nominalized predicates
that are analogous to the argument/adjunct distinction for verbs. Another reason for
the lower accuracy for nominalized predicates is the more diverse distribution of their
arguments. Arguments can be found either inside or outside the NP headed by the
predicate, or even in relative clauses that modify the NP headed by the predicate.
There are many directions we can go from here for future work. There are many
proven techniques that can be implemented for Chinese, the most important of which
is to make Chinese parsers more robust. One thing we plan to experiment with is the
combination of multiple parsers and multiple semantic role labeling systems. We also
believe that we have not settled on an ”optimal” set of features for Chinese semantic role
labeling and more language-specific customization is necessary. We believe that joint-
learning is also a promising avenue to pursue, especially for verbs where generally more
core arguments are realized.

<abstract confidence="0.992556882352941">In this article we report work on Chinese semantic role labeling, taking advantage of two recently completed corpora, the Chinese PropBank, a semantically annotated corpus of Chinese verbs, and the Chinese Nombank, a companion corpus that annotates the predicate–argument structure of nominalized predicates. Because the semantic role labels are assigned to the constituents in a parse tree, we first report experiments in which semantic role labels are automatically assigned to hand-crafted parses in the Chinese Treebank. This gives us a measure of the extent to which semantic role labels can be bootstrapped from the syntactic annotation provided in the treebank. We then report experiments using automatic parses with decreasing levels of human annotation in the input to the syntactic parser: parses that use gold-standard segmentation and POS-tagging, parses that use only gold-standard segmentation, and fully automatic parses. These experiments gauge how successful semantic role labeling for Chinese can be in more realistic situations. Our results show that when hand-crafted parses are used, semantic role labeling accuracy for Chinese is comparable to what has been reported for the state-of-the-art English semantic role labeling systems trained and tested on the English PropBank, even though the Chinese PropBank is significantly smaller in size. When an automatic parser is used, however, the accuracy of our system is significantly lower than the English state of the art. This indicates that an improvement in Chinese parsing is critical to high-performance semantic role labeling for Chinese.</abstract>

When the word segmentation is singled out for evaluation, the parser achieved an F-score of 0.969. It is important to point out that these results cannot be directly compared with most of the results reported in the literature, where correct segmentation is assumed. In addition, in order to account for the differences in segmentation, each character has to be treated as a leaf of the parse tree. This is in contrast with word-based parsers where words are terminals. For comparison purposes, we also used the Bikel parser (Bikel 2004). Because the Bikel parser assumes segmented sentences as input, we extracted the segmentation from the output of our parser and fed it into the Bikel parser. We also experimented with using gold-standard segmentation and POS from the Chinese Treebank as input to the Bikel parser to measure the effect of segmentation and POS tagging on the performance on the semantic role labeling. Because semantic role labeling is performed on the output of a syntactic parser, only constituents in the parse tree are candidates.

Typical semantic roles include agent, patient, source, goal, and so forth, that are core to a predicate, as well as location, time, manner, cause, and so on, that are peripheral. Such semantic information is important in answering who, what, when, where, and why questions therefore is crucial to natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as question-answering (Narayanan and Harabagiu 2004), information extraction (Surdeanu et al. 2005), summarization (Melli et al. 2005), and machine translation (Boas 2002). Any NLP task that requires some form of semantic interpretation could potentially benefit from a high performance semantic role labeling system.

While FrameNet annotates the semantic roles of both verbal and nominal predicates, the annotation of PropBank is limited to verbs, with the nominal predicates annotated in a separate but related project, the Nombank Project (Meyers et al. 2004). The NomBank Project adopted the same predicate-specific approach in representing the core arguments of a predicate as PropBank, with special treatment for noun-specific phenomena such as support verbs. There is considerable work on English semantic role labeling with both annotation conventions. Gildea and Jurafsky (2002) did their seminal work using data from FrameNet. The Senseval-3 international competition on semantic role labeling (Litkowski 2004) also used the FrameNet annotation. There is an even larger body of work using PropBank because it has a larger amount of annotated data on a wellestablished data set, the Penn Treebank (Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz 1993).

This is in contrast with a low-level NLP task such as POS tagging, which generally has a small feature space. A wide range of features have been shown to be useful in previous work on semantic role labeling (Gildea and Jurafsky 2002; Pradhan, Ward et al. 2004; Xue and Palmer 2004) and we suspect that many more will be tested before the field will settle down to a core set of features. In their preliminary work on Chinese semantic role labeling, Sun and Jurafsky (2004) successfully ported a number of the features used in Gildea and Jurafsky (2002) to Chinese. In our experiments we adapted more features that have been described in recent work on English semantic role labeling to Chinese. We used a combination of features from Gildea and Jurafsky (G&amp;J) (2002), Pradhan, Ward et al. (P et al.) (2004), and Xue and Palmer (X&amp;P)</context>

So for prepositional phrases we use both the preposition and the head noun as features in our system. As has been discussed by Sun and Jurafsky, the head word feature also tends to be sparse, especially given the smaller size of the Chinese Treebank. The chance of seeing a word in the test data that also occurs in the training data is small. The POS tag serves as one form of backoff: Constituents headed by words that have the same part-of-speech are likely to receive the same semantic role labels as well. The subcat feature, as implemented in previous work (Gildea and Jurafsky 2002), is defined as the rule that expands the VP dominating the verbal predicate. By definition, it does not vary with the constituents in a parse tree. In other words, all constituents in the parse tree share the same subcat feature. To make up for the weakness of this feature, we implemented another feature called subcat+, which is the syntactic frame feature in Xue and Palmer (2004). The subcat+ feature heuristically identifies the key NP arguments for a given predicate, and the feature value of a given constituent is determined by its position in relation to these NPs and the predicate.

Out of the 1,124 predicate instances, 138 are the heads of relative clauses. The precision and recall for these predicates are 0.668 and 0.5, respectively, in comparison with the 0.749 and 0.696 for predicates that are not the head of a relative clause. The much lower recall suggests the arguments for the head of a relative clause are much harder to identify. 6. Related Work Computational approaches to semantic interpretation have a long tradition, but the line of research that this work follows is relatively young. Gildea and Jurafsky (2002) provided the seminal work on the semantic role labeling, using the FrameNet corpus as training and test material. Since then, there has been rapid improvement in the semantic role labeling accuracy of English verbs, fueled by the development of PropBank (Palmer, Gildea, and Kingsbury 2005), which annotates the verbs in the one-millionword Penn Treebank with semantic role labels.

The Chinese PropBank focuses on the context-sensitive component of the semantic role annotation, using frame files to guide its annotation. The semantic roles defined in the frame files are for expected arguments, that is, all possible arguments for each frameset of a predicate. In a particular sentence, an expected argument may not always be realized, and when it is, it may not always be realized in the same syntactic position as a result of syntactic alternations (Levin 1993) or other syntactic processes. In addition, different framesets of a verb take different sets of arguments that demonstrate different syntactic patterns.

In Examples (2) and (3), we have already seen where essentially the same predicate is realized as a verb or a noun, and its arguments are realized as different syntactic categories in different syntactic positions. Syntactic variations occur even without the categorial change of the predicate. Levin (1993) demonstrates extensively how the argument structure of English verbs can be realized differently through diathesis alternations. Similar alternations can also be observed in Chinese, and Example (5) shows this: (5) a. [Arg1 FP X �Ztl RAJ �kIl ] [rel TTff ] � .

One salient type of syntactic alternation is the well-known ”subject of intransitive / object of transitive” alternation described in detail in Levin (1993).

Since the seminal work of Gildea and Jurafsky (2002), statistical and machine learning approaches have been the predominant research paradigm in semantic role labeling, like most of the subfields in natural language processing and computational linguistics. A prerequisite for statistical and machine learning approaches to semantic role labeling is the availability of a significant amount of semantically interpreted corpora from which automatic systems can learn. The recent activities in semantic role labeling (Carreras and M`arquez 2004b, 2005; Litkowski 2004) have in large part been driven by the availability of semantically annotated corpora such as the FrameNet (Baker, Fillmore, and Lowe 1998), Proposition Bank (Palmer, Gildea, and Kingsbury 2005), and Nombank (Meyers et al. 2004) projects for English; the tectogrammatical layer annotation of the Prague Dependency Treebank (Sgall, Panevov´a, and Hajiˇcov´a 2004) for Czech; and the Salsa Project for German (Burchardt et al. 2006).

The NomBank Project adopted the same predicate-specific approach in representing the core arguments of a predicate as PropBank, with special treatment for noun-specific phenomena such as support verbs. There is considerable work on English semantic role labeling with both annotation conventions. Gildea and Jurafsky (2002) did their seminal work using data from FrameNet. The Senseval-3 international competition on semantic role labeling (Litkowski 2004) also used the FrameNet annotation. There is an even larger body of work using PropBank because it has a larger amount of annotated data on a wellestablished data set, the Penn Treebank (Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz 1993). Using the standard training and test sets in the Penn Treebank, there has been a rapid improvement in performance due to the use of more advanced machine-learning techniques and more informative linguistic features.

The semantic role labeling performance on the FrameNet data set has also improved significantly from Gildea and Jurafsky’s (2002) early results, thanks mostly to the Senseval-3 semantic role labeling competition (Litkowski 2004).

As word segmentation is a very challenging problem that has attracted a large body of research by itself, it is still unclear how well semantic role tagging in Chinese can be performed in realistic situations. In our experiments, we implemented a Maximum Entropy–based parser similar to Luo (2003). The parser performs Chinese word segmentation, POS tagging, and parsing in one integrated system. The parser is trained on the Xinhua news and Broadcast news portion of the Chinese Treebank, which has 498K words. Tested on the held-out test data, the parser achieved an unlabeled precision and recall of 0.889 and 0.868, respectively, for the combined word segmentation and parsing accuracy. When the word segmentation is singled out for evaluation, the parser achieved an F-score of 0.969.

In the work we report here, for both argument detection and classification tasks, we used a Maximum Entropy classifier with a tunable Gaussian prior in the Mallet Toolkit (McCallum 2002). The Maximum Entropy classifier does multi-category classification and thus can be straightforwardly applied to the problem here. The classifier can be tuned to minimize overfitting by adjusting the Gaussian prior. In summary, in our system, the semantic role labeling is done in three stages, as illustrated in Figure 1: pruning, argument detection, and argument classification. 4. Semantic Role Labeling of Verbs In this section we report our experiments on the semantic role labeling of Chinese verbs, using the Chinese PropBank as training and test material.

A semantic role represents a semantic relation between a predicate and one of its arguments. Typical semantic roles include agent, patient, source, goal, and so forth, that are core to a predicate, as well as location, time, manner, cause, and so on, that are peripheral. Such semantic information is important in answering who, what, when, where, and why questions therefore is crucial to natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as question-answering (Narayanan and Harabagiu 2004), information extraction (Surdeanu et al. 2005), summarization (Melli et al. 2005), and machine translation (Boas 2002). Any NLP task that requires some form of semantic interpretation could potentially benefit from a high performance semantic role labeling system. For an automatic system, a semantic role labeling task involves locating the linguistic units, typically words or phrases, in natural language text that serve as arguments * 1777 Exposition Drive, Boulder, CO 80309.

Generally, the efficacy of the pruning algorithm correlates with the quality of syntactic parses that the semantic role labeling system takes as input. That is, it works much better with treebank parses than with automatic parses. It also works more effectively for verbs than for nouns, the arguments of which have a more diverse distribution. Argument classification, which classifies the constituents into a category that corresponds to one of the semantic role labels, is a natural multi-category classification problem. It has been generally shown in the literature (Pradhan et al. 2003) that it is a good idea to bias the argument detection stage toward high recall so that reasonably good candidates can be passed along to the argument classification stage, and this means the tag set for argument classification also includes the NULL label. Many classification techniques—SVM (Pradhan, Ward et al. 2004), perceptrons (Carreras and M`arquez 2004a), Maximum Entropy (Xue and Palmer 2004), and so forth—have been successfully used to solve the semantic role labeling problem.

Research on Chinese semantic role labeling is still in its infancy. Work on Chinese semantic role labeling has been scant and sporadic, mostly due to the lack of a publicly available semantically annotated corpus of significant size. Although most of the machine-learning techniques used in English semantic role labeling are readily transferable to Chinese, such technological transfer is only possible with similarly annotated data. To our knowledge, there are only two such data sets, which all used a small corpus that the authors created on their own. Sun and Jurafsky (2004) did preliminary work on Chinese semantic role labeling on 10 selected verbs using Support Vector Machines and reported promising early results.1 Noting that Chinese syntactic parsing is an especially challenging task, Kwong and T’sou (2005) reformulated semantic role labeling as a task of detecting and classifying the heads of arguments to avoid the hard problem of getting the correct text spans for the arguments. In this article, we 1 They restated their results in Chen, Sun, and Jurafsky (2005) due to an error in retraining the Collins parser (Collins 1999) on Chinese, which led to inflated</context>

This is in contrast with a low-level NLP task such as POS tagging, which generally has a small feature space. A wide range of features have been shown to be useful in previous work on semantic role labeling (Gildea and Jurafsky 2002; Pradhan, Ward et al. 2004; Xue and Palmer 2004) and we suspect that many more will be tested before the field will settle down to a core set of features. In their preliminary work on Chinese semantic role labeling, Sun and Jurafsky (2004) successfully ported a number of the features used in Gildea and Jurafsky (2002) to Chinese. In our experiments we adapted more features that have been described in recent work on English semantic role labeling to Chinese. We used a combination of features from Gildea and Jurafsky (G&amp;J) (2002), Pradhan, Ward et al. (P et al.) (2004), and Xue and Palmer (X&amp;P) (2004), and these are used as baseline features. In addition, we proposed a set of new features that used verb class information induced from the frame files of the Chinese PropBank, as well as features that were designed to exploit the gr</context>

Forty classes were semi-automatically derived in this manner. Such a classification scheme will undoubtedly prove to be linguistically unsophisticated. Verbs that have the same number of arguments may have different types of arguments, and the current classification system does not pick up these distinctions. However, our experiments show that even such a simple classification can be used to provide features that improve the semantic role labeling performance. 4.3 Using Automatic Parses Previous work (Sun and Jurafsky 2004) on Chinese semantic role labeling uses a parser that assumes correct (hand-crafted) segmentation. As word segmentation is a very challenging problem that has attracted a large body of research by itself, it is still unclear how well semantic role tagging in Chinese can be performed in realistic situations. In our experiments, we implemented a Maximum Entropy–based parser similar to Luo (2003). The parser performs Chinese word segmentation, POS tagging, and parsing in one integrated system. The parser is trained on the Xinhua news and Broadcast news portion of the Chinese Treebank, which has 4</context>

A semantic role represents a semantic relation between a predicate and one of its arguments. Typical semantic roles include agent, patient, source, goal, and so forth, that are core to a predicate, as well as location, time, manner, cause, and so on, that are peripheral. Such semantic information is important in answering who, what, when, where, and why questions therefore is crucial to natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as question-answering (Narayanan and Harabagiu 2004), information extraction (Surdeanu et al. 2005), summarization (Melli et al. 2005), and machine translation (Boas 2002). Any NLP task that requires some form of semantic interpretation could potentially benefit from a high performance semantic role labeling system. For an automatic system, a semantic role labeling task involves locating the linguistic units, typically words or phrases, in natural language text that serve as arguments * 1777 Exposition Drive, Boulder, CO 80309.

Since then, there has been rapid improvement in the semantic role labeling accuracy of English verbs, fueled by the development of PropBank (Palmer, Gildea, and Kingsbury 2005), which annotates the verbs in the one-millionword Penn Treebank with semantic role labels. A wide range of statistical and machine learning techniques have been applied to the semantic role labeling of verbs, using PropBank as training and test material. The machine-learning techniques used include Support Vector Machines (Pradhan, Ward et al. 2004; Tsai et al. 2005), Maximum Entropy (Xue and Palmer 2004; Haghighi, Toutanova, and Manning 2005; Liu et al. 2005; Yi and Palmer 2005), Conditional Random Fields (Cohn and Blunsom 2005), and many others. Because semantic role labeling is a complex task based on a wide range of lower level natural language techniques, many different preprocessing, integration, and combination techniques have been explored. The relative merits of using a full syntactic parser that provides hierarchical structures (Xue and Palmer 2004) vs. a shallow chunker (Pradhan, Hacioglu et al. 2005; Hacioglu et al. 2004) has been studied exte</context>

System Overview Assuming the availability of a parse tree (either hand-crafted parses in a treebank or parses generated by an automatic parser) as input, to assign the semantic role labels described in Section 2 automatically involves first of all identifying which constituents in the parse tree are semantic arguments to the predicate in question and then assigning appropriate semantic role labels to them. The predominant approach to the semantic role labeling task is to formulate it as a classification problem (Pradhan, Ward et al. 2004; Xue and Palmer 2004) that can be solved with machine-learning techniques. One can imagine a classification task in which each constituent in the parse tree is labeled either with one of the numbered argument labels (Arg0 through Arg5), or with one of the semantic adjunct labels ArgM-TMP, ArgM-MNR, and so on, or with the NULL label, indicating the constituent is neither an argument nor adjunct to the predicate. This simple formulation of the classification problem is rarely practiced in the semantic role labeling literature for the simple reason that the majority of the constituents in a parse tree are generally n</context>
<context position="27074" citStr="Xue and Palmer 2004" startWordPosition="4261" endWordPosition="4264">n practice, most semantic role labeling systems work in stages, which minimally consist of an argument detection stage and an argument classification stage. Argument detection is generally formulated as a binary classification task that separates constituents that are arguments or adjuncts to a predicate from those that are not related to the predicate in question. By lumping together argument and adjunct labels, the positive and negative sample imbalance is alleviated somewhat. In addition, it has been shown that argument detection and argument classification need different sets of features (Xue and Palmer 2004). A system cannot take advantage of this if both are done in one fell swoop. With a powerful machine-learning algorithm, argument detection can be done with high accuracy (Hacioglu et al. 2004; Pradhan, Ward et al. 2004), provided that the appropriate features are used. The positive and negative sample imbalance can only be partially addressed by having a separate argument detection stage. Even with a binary classification task, the number of negative samples is still overwhelmingly larger than the positive samples. In addition, it does not take advantage of the fact that the arguments and adj</context>
<context position="28318" citStr="Xue and Palmer (2004)" startWordPosition="4456" endWordPosition="4459">erbal or nominalized, are related to the predicate itself in linguistically wellunderstood structural configurations. The overwhelming majority of the arguments and adjuncts are populated along the spine of the parse tree that the predicate projects. A substantial number of the constituents can be eliminated from further consideration as negative samples with a high degree of certainty. (See Sections 4.1 and 5.1 for an 233 Computational Linguistics Volume 34, Number 2 evaluation of how effectively the pruning algorithm works for verbs and nouns.) This was proved to be a successful strategy by Xue and Palmer (2004) for the semantic role labeling of English verbs; they use a heuristic algorithm to first prune out irrelevant constituents before the remaining candidates are fed into an argument detection algorithm. This strategy has also been effectively adopted by others (Cohn and Blunsom 2005; Punyakanok, Roth, and Yih 2005) and is used here. As we will show in later sections, the pruning algorithm needs to be slightly different for verbal and nominal predicates and they do not work equally well for all experimental conditions. Generally, the efficacy of the pruning algorithm correlates with the quality </context>

It has been generally shown in the literature (Pradhan et al. 2003) that it is a good idea to bias the argument detection stage toward high recall so that reasonably good candidates can be passed along to the argument classification stage, and this means the tag set for argument classification also includes the NULL label. Many classification techniques—SVM (Pradhan, Ward et al. 2004), perceptrons (Carreras and M`arquez 2004a), Maximum Entropy (Xue and Palmer 2004), and so forth—have been successfully used to solve the semantic role labeling problem. In the work we report here, for both argument detection and classification tasks, we used a Maximum Entropy classifier with a tunable Gaussian prior in the Mallet Toolkit (McCallum 2002). The Maximum Entropy classifier does multi-category classification and thus can be straightforwardly applied to the problem here. The classifier can be tuned to minimize overfitting by adjusting the Gaussian prior. In summary, in our system, the semantic role labeling is done in three stages, as illustrated in Figure 1: pru</context>

This is in contrast with a low-level NLP task such as POS tagging, which generally has a small feature space. A wide range of features have been shown to be useful in previous work on semantic role labeling (Gildea and Jurafsky 2002; Pradhan, Ward et al. 2004; Xue and Palmer 2004) and we suspect that many more will be tested before the field will settle down to a core set of features. In their preliminary work on Chinese semantic role labeling, Sun and Jurafsky (2004) successfully ported a number of the features used in Gildea and Jurafsky (2002) to Chinese. In our experiments we adapted more features that have been described in recent work on English semantic role labeling to Chinese. We used a combination of features from Gildea and Jurafsky (G&amp;J) (2002), Pradhan, Ward et al. (P et al.) (2004), and Xue and Palmer (X&amp;P) (2004), and these are used as baseline features.</context>

We briefly discuss these features and where necessary explain at an intuitive level why they are useful for semantic role labeling. It has been well-established in the semantic role labeling literature that features are not equally effective for argument detection and argument classification (Xue and Palmer 2004). Our experimental results on Chinese semantic role labeling generally support this observation. The features we used for the semantic role labeling of verbs are listed below. Features that are marked as ”C” are used only in the argument classification task. Features that are marked as ”D” are for argument detection only. Features that are used in both argument detection and argument classification stages are marked as ”C,D”. I. Baseline Features: C Position: The position is defined in relation to the predicate verb and the values are before and after. (G&amp;J) C Subcat frame: The rule that expan</context>

The subcat feature, as implemented in previous work (Gildea and Jurafsky 2002), is defined as the rule that expands the VP dominating the verbal predicate. By definition, it does not vary with the constituents in a parse tree. In other words, all constituents in the parse tree share the same subcat feature. To make up for the weakness of this feature, we implemented another feature called subcat+, which is the syntactic frame feature in Xue and Palmer (2004). The subcat+ feature heuristically identifies the key NP arguments for a given predicate, and the feature value of a given constituent is determined by its position in relation to these NPs and the predicate. In this way this feature varies with the constituent being classified and it also partially addresses the issue that the semantic role of one constituent is not independent of other arguments for this predicate. As we pointed out in Section 2, the argument labels in the PropBank annotation are verb-specific. Given a head word or phrase type, the system will be more certain of the semanti</context>

This accuracy is achieved when the new features are added. Without the new features, the accuracy drops about one percentage point. When the arguments are known, the accuracy is at 94.1% when the new features are used, up one percentage point from the baseline. This accuracy is fairly high considering the fact that the state-of-the-art for semantic role labeling systems trained on the English PropBank (Palmer, Gildea, and Kingsbury 2005) is about 93% percent (Pradhan, Ward et al. 2004; Xue and Palmer 2004) when the arguments are known and the English PropBank is a much larger corpus that has one million words. The high baseline accuracy also suggests that the features used for the English semantic role labeling port very well to Chinese. In addition, there are several facilitating factors for Chinese semantic role labeling when hand-crafted parses are provided as input. First of all, Chinese verbs appear to be less polysemous, at least the ones that occur in the Chinese Treebank. Of the 4,854 verbs in this version of the Chinese Proposition bank, only 62 verbs have three or more framesets. In c</context>

Since then, there has been rapid improvement in the semantic role labeling accuracy of English verbs, fueled by the development of PropBank (Palmer, Gildea, and Kingsbury 2005), which annotates the verbs in the one-millionword Penn Treebank with semantic role labels. A wide range of statistical and machine learning techniques have been applied to the semantic role labeling of verbs, using PropBank as training and test material. The machine-learning techniques used include Support Vector Machines (Pradhan, Ward et al. 2004; Tsai et al. 2005), Maximum Entropy (Xue and Palmer 2004; Haghighi, Toutanova, and Manning 2005; Liu et al. 2005; Yi and Palmer 2005), Conditional Random Fields (Cohn and Blunsom 2005), and many others. Because semantic role labeling is a complex task based on a wide range of lower level natural language techniques, many different preprocessing, integration, and combination techniques have been explored. The relative merits of using a full syntactic parser that provides hierarchical structures (Xue and Palmer 2004) vs. a shallow chunker (Pradhan, Hacioglu et al. 2005; Hacioglu et al. 2004) has been studied extensively.

The results of the semantic role labeling for both hand-crafted and automatic parses are presented in Table 2.

Both corpora are built on top of the Chinese Treebank (Xue et al. 2005), in the sense that the semantic role labels are assigned to constituents in the parse tree. The Chinese PropBank and Nombank adopted the English PropBank predicatespecific approach in representing the semantic roles of the core arguments. In the absence of a Chinese linguistic ontology like the semantic frames developed for the English FrameNet Project, using the PropBank-style of semantic roles allows faster development. The predicate-specific approach of the PropBank annotation builds a solid foundation for making high-level generalizations in a bottom-up manner, if broader generalizations </context>
