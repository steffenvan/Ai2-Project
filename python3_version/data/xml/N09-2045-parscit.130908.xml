<bodyText confidence="0.9991478">
The complexity of sentences characteristic to
biomedical articles poses a challenge to natu-
ral language parsers, which are typically
trained on large-scale corpora of non-technical
text. We propose a text simplification process,
bioSimplify, that seeks to reduce the complex-
ity of sentences in biomedical abstracts in or-
der to improve the performance of syntactic
parsers on the processed sentences. Syntactic
parsing is typically one of the first steps in a
text mining pipeline. Thus, any improvement
in performance would have a ripple effect
over all processing steps. We evaluated our
method using a corpus of biomedical sen-
tences annotated with syntactic links. Our em-
pirical results show an improvement of 2.90%
for the Charniak-McClosky parser and of
4.23% for the Link Grammar parser when
processing simplified sentences rather than the
original sentences in the corpus.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99993682051282">
It is typical that applications for biomedical text
involve the use of natural language syntactic pars-
ers as one of the first steps in processing. Thus, the
performance of the system as a whole is largely
dependent on how well the natural language syn-
tactic parsers perform.
One of the challenges in parsing biomedical text is
that it is significantly more complex than articles in
typical English text. Different analysis show other
problematic characteristics, including inconsistent
use of nouns and partial words (Tateisi &amp; Tsujii,
2004), higher perplexity measures (Elhadad, 2006),
greater lexical density, plus increased number of
relative clauses and prepositional phrases (Ge-
moets, 2004), all of which correlate with dimi-
nished comprehension and higher text difficulty.
These characteristics also lead to performance
problems in terms of computation time and accura-
cy for parsers that are trained on common English
text corpus.
We identified three categories of sentences: 1)
normal English sentences, like in Newswire text,
2) normal biomedical English sentences – those
sentences which can be parsed without a problem
by Link Grammar-, and 3) complex biomedical
English sentences – those sentences which can’t be
parsed by Link Grammar. Aside from the known
characteristics mentioned before, sentences in the
third group tended to be longer (18% of them had
more than 50 words, while only 8% of those in
group 2 and 2% of those in group 1 did). It has
been observed that parsers perform well with sen-
tences of reduced length (Chandrasekar &amp; Srini-
vas, 1997; Siddharthan, 2006).
In this paper, we explore the use of text simplifi-
cation as a preprocessing step for general parsing
to reduce length and complexity of biomedical sen-
tences in order to enhance the performance of the
parsers.

2 Methods

<bodyText confidence="0.999954181818182">
There are currently many publicly available corpo-
ra of biomedical texts, the most popular among
them being BioInfer, Genia, AImed, HPRD 50,
IEPA, LLL and BioCreative1-PPI. Among these
corpora, BioInfer includes the most comprehensive
collection of sentences and careful annotation for
links of natural parser, in both the Stanford and
Link Grammar schemes. Therefore, we chose the
BioInfer corpus, version 1.1.0 (Pyysalo et al.,
2007), containing 1100 sentences for evaluating
the effectiveness of our simplification method on

the performance of syntactic parsers. The method
includes syntactic and non-syntactic transforma-
tions, detailed next.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.954727">
2.1 Non-syntactic transformation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99995715">
We group here three steps of our approach: 1. pre-
processing through removal of spurious phrases; 2.
replacement of gene names; 3. replacement of
noun phrases.
To improve the correctness of the parsing, each
biomedical sentence is first preprocessed to re-
move phrases that are not essential to the sentence.
This includes removal of section indicators, which
are phrases that specify the name of the section at
the beginning of the sentence, plus the removal of
phrases in parentheses (such as citations and num-
bering in lists). Also, partially hyphenated words
are transformed by combining with the nearest
word that follows or precedes the partial hyphe-
nated word to make a meaningful word. For in-
stance, the phrase “alpha- and beta-catenin” is
transformed into “alpha-catenin and beta-catenin”.
Occurrences of multi-word technical terms and
entity names involved in biomedical processes are
common in biomedical text. Such terms are not
likely to appear in the dictionary of a parser (per-
plexity is high), and will force it to use morpho-
guessing and unknown word guessing. This is time
consuming and prone to error. Thus, unlike typical
text simplification that emphasizes syntactic trans-
formation of sentences, our approach utilizes a
named entity recognition engine, BANNER
(Leaman &amp; Gonzalez, 2008), to replace multi-word
gene names with single-word placeholders.
Replacement of gene names with single elements
is not enough, however, and grammatical category
(i.e. singular or plural) of the element has to be
considered. Lingpipe (Alias-i, 2006), a shallow
parser for biomedical text, identifies noun phrases
and replaces them with single elements. A single
element is considered singular when the following
verb indicates a third-person singular verb or the
determiner preceded by the element is either “a” or
“an”. Otherwise it is considered as plural and an
“s” is attached to the end of the element.

2.2 Syntactic transformation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98929104">
The problem of simplifying long sentences in
common English text has been studied before, not-
ably by Chandrasekar &amp; Srinivas (1997) and Sidd-
harthan (2006). However, the techniques used in
these studies might not totally solve the issue of
parsing biomedical sentences. For example, using
Siddharthan’s approach, the biological finding
“The Huntington&apos;s disease protein interacts with
p53 and CREB-binding protein and represses tran-
scription”, and assuming multi-word nouns such as
“CREB-binding protein” do not present a problem,
would be simplified to:
“The Huntington&apos;s disease protein interacts with
p53. The Huntington&apos;s disease protein interacts
with CREB-binding protein. The Huntington&apos;s
disease protein represses transcription.”
Our method transforms it to “GENE1 interacts
with GENE2 and GENE3 and represses transcrip-
tion.” Both decrease the average sentence length,
but the earlier distorts the biological meaning
(since the Huntington’s disease protein might not
repress transcription on its own), while the latter
signifies it.
While replacement of gene names and noun
phrases can reduce the sentence length, there are

cases when the sentences are still too complex to
be parsed efficiently. We developed a simple algo-
rithm that utilizes linkages (specific grammatical
relationships between pairs of words in a sentence)
of the Link Grammar parser (Sleator, 1998) and
punctuations for splitting sentences into clauses.
An example in Figure 1 illustrates the main part of
the algorithm. Each linkage has a primary link type
in CAPITAL followed by secondary link type in
short. The intuition behind the algorithm is to try to
identify independent clauses from complex sen-
tences. The first step is to split the sentence ST into
clauses c1, c2, c3 and c4 based on commas. c1 is
parsed using the Link Grammar parser, but c1 can-
not be a sentence as there is no “S” link in the lin-
kage of c1. c2 is then attached to c1 and the linkage
of “c1, c2” does not contain a “S” link as well. “c1,
c2, c3.” is recognized as a sentence, since the lin-
kage contains an “S” link, indicating that it is a
sentence, as well as the linkage of c4. So the algo-
rithm returns two sentences ST1 and ST2 for ST.

Our method has the greatest impact on the perfor-
mance of Link Grammar (LG), which lies at the
core of BioLG (Pyysalo et al., 2006). However, it
also has a significant impact on the self-training
biomedical parser by McClosky &amp; Charniak (CM),
which is currently the best parser available for
biomedical text.

tested on the 1100 annotated sentences of the Bio-

because of syntactic transformation (section 2.2).
The number of words per sentence showed a sharp
drop of 20.4% from 27.0 to 21.5. The Flesh-

into panic mode. After processing, only 39 out of
1159 simplified sentences triggered panic mode (a
16.4% improvement in efficiency). The average

parsing: Let Σg, Σo and Σs, respectively be the
sets containing the links of the gold standard, the
output generated by the parser on original sen-
tences and the output generated by the parser on
simplified sentences. We denote a link of type Π
between the tokens Φ1 and Φ2 by (Π,Φ1,Φ2). In the
case of the original sentences, the tokens Φ1and Φ2
are single-worded. So, (Π,Φ1,Φ2) is a true positive
iff (Π,Φ1,Φ2) belongs to both Σg and Σo, false posi-
tive iff it only belongs to Σo and false negative iff
it only belongs to Σg. In the case of simplified sen-
tences, the tokens Φ1and Φ2 can have multiple
words. So, (Π,Φ1,Φ2) which belongs to Σs is a true
positive iff (Π,Φ’1,Φ’2) belongs to Σg where Φ’1
and Φ’2 are respectively one of the words in Φ1 and
Φ2. Additionally, (Π,Φ1,Φ2) which belongs to Σg is
not a false negative if Φ1 and Φ2 are parts of a sin-
gle token of a simplified sentence. For measuring
the performance of a parser, the nature of linkage
is most relevant in the context of the sentence in
consideration. So, we calculate precision and recall
for each sentence and average them over all sen-
tences to get the respective precision and recall for
the collection.

During the creation of BioInfer, noun phrase ma-
cro-dependencies were determined using a simple
rule set without parsing. Some of the problems re-
lated to parsing noun phrases were removed by
reducing the number of words by more than 20%.
BioLG enhances LG by expansion of lexicons and
the addition of morphological rules for biomedical
domain. Our work differs from BioLG not only in
utilizing a gene name recognizer, a specialized
shallow parser and syntactic transformation, but
also in creating a preprocessor that can improve the
performance of any parser on biomedical text.
The idea of improving the performance of deep
parsers through the integration of shallow and deep
parsers has been reported in (Crysmann et al.,
2002; Daum et al., 2003; Frank et al., 2003) for
non-biomedical text. In BioNLP, extraction sys-
tems (Jang et al., 2006; Yakushiji et al., 2001) used
shallow parsers to enhance the performance of
deep parsers. However, there is a lack of evalua-
tion of the correctness of the dependency parses,
which is crucial to the correctness of the extracted
systems. We not only evaluate the correctness of
the links, but also go beyond the problem of rela-
tionship extraction and empower future researchers
in leveraging their parsers (and other extraction
systems) to get better results.

Thus, the performance of the system as a whole is largely dependent on how well the natural language syntactic parsers perform. One of the challenges in parsing biomedical text is that it is significantly more complex than articles in typical English text. Different analysis show other problematic characteristics, including inconsistent use of nouns and partial words (Tateisi &amp; Tsujii, 2004), higher perplexity measures (Elhadad, 2006), greater lexical density, plus increased number of relative clauses and prepositional phrases (Gemoets, 2004), all of which correlate with diminished comprehension and higher text difficulty. These characteristics also lead to performance problems in terms of computation time and accuracy for parsers that are trained on common English text corpus. We identified three categories of sentences: 1) normal English sentences, like in Newswire text, 2) normal biomedical English sentences – those sentences which can be parsed without a problem by Link Grammar-, and 3) complex biomedical English sente</context>

For instance, the phrase “alpha- and beta-catenin” is transformed into “alpha-catenin and beta-catenin”. Occurrences of multi-word technical terms and entity names involved in biomedical processes are common in biomedical text. Such terms are not likely to appear in the dictionary of a parser (perplexity is high), and will force it to use morphoguessing and unknown word guessing. This is time consuming and prone to error. Thus, unlike typical text simplification that emphasizes syntactic transformation of sentences, our approach utilizes a named entity recognition engine, BANNER (Leaman &amp; Gonzalez, 2008), to replace multi-word gene names with single-word placeholders. Replacement of gene names with single elements is not enough, however, and grammatical category (i.e. singular or plural) of the element has to be considered. Lingpipe (Alias-i, 2006), a shallow parser for biomedical text, identifies noun phrases and replaces them with single elements. A single element is considered singular when the following verb indicates a third-person singular verb or the determiner preceded by the element is either “a” or “an”. Otherwise it is considered as plural and an “s” is attached to the end of the e</context>

So the algorithm returns two sentences ST1 and ST2 for ST. 3 Results Our method has the greatest impact on the performance of Link Grammar (LG), which lies at the core of BioLG (Pyysalo et al., 2006). However, it also has a significant impact on the self-training biomedical parser by McClosky &amp; Charniak (CM), which is currently the best parser available for biomedical text. 3.1 Rudimentary statistics of the results of simplification: After the simplification algorithm was tested on the 1100 annotated sentences of the BioInfer corpus, there were 1159 simplified sentences because of syntactic transformation (section 2.2).

Aside from the known characteristics mentioned before, sentences in the third group tended to be longer (18% of them had more than 50 words, while only 8% of those in group 2 and 2% of those in group 1 did). It has been observed that parsers perform well with sentences of reduced length (Chandrasekar &amp; Srinivas, 1997; Siddharthan, 2006).

However, the techniques used in these studies might not totally solve the issue of parsing biomedical sentences. For example, using Siddharthan’s approach, the biological finding “The Huntington&apos;s disease protein interacts with p53 and CREB-binding protein and represses transcription”, and assuming multi-word nouns such as “CREB-binding protein” do not present a problem, would be simplified to: “The Huntington&apos;s disease protein interacts with p53.

An example in Figure 1 illustrates the main part of the algorithm. Each linkage has a primary link type in CAPITAL followed by secondary link type in short. The intuition behind the algorithm is to try to identify independent clauses from complex sentences. The first step is to split the sentence ST into clauses c1, c2, c3 and c4 based on commas. c1 is parsed using the Link Grammar parser, but c1 cannot be a sentence as there is no “S” link in the linkage of c1. c2 is then attached to c1 and the linkage of “c1, c2” does not contain a “S” </context>
