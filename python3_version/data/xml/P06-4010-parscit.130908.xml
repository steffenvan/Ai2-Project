<bodyText confidence="0.9997045625">
In this interactive presentation, a Chinese
named entity and relation identification
system is demonstrated. The domain-
specific system has a three-stage pipeline
architecture which includes word seg-
mentation and part-of-speech (POS) tag-
ging, named entity recognition, and
named entity relation identitfication. The
experimental results have shown that the
average F-measure for word segmenta-
tion and POS tagging after correcting er-
rors achieves 92.86 and 90.01 separately.
Moreover, the overall average F-measure
for 6 kinds of name entities and 14 kinds
of named entity relations is 83.08% and
70.46% respectively.

1 Introduction

The investigation for Chinese information ex-
traction is one of the topics of the project COL-
LATE (DFKI, 2002) dedicated to building up the
German Competence Center for Language Tech-
nology. The presented work aims at investigating
automatic identification of Chinese named enti-
ties (NEs) and their relations in a specific domain.
Information Extraction (IE) is an innovative
language technology for accurately acquiring
crucial information from documents. NE recog-
nition is a fundamental IE task, that detects some
named constituents in sentences, for instance
names of persons, places, organizations, dates,
times, and so on. Based on NE recognition, the
identification of Named Entity Relation (NER)
can indicate the types of semantic relationships
between identified NEs. e.g., relationships be-
tween person and employed organization; person
and residing place; person and birthday; organi-
zation and seat, etc. The identified results for
NEs and NERs can be provided as a resource for
other application systems such as question-
answering system. Therefore, these two IE tasks
are selected as our investigation emphases.
Chinese has a very different structure from
western languages. For example, it has a large
character set involving more than 48,000 charac-
ters; there is no space between words in written
texts; and Chinese words have fewer inflections,
etc. In the past twenty years there have been sig-
nificant achievements in IE concerning western
languages such as English. Comparing with that,
the research on the relevant properties of Chinese
for IE, especially for NER, is still insufficient.
Our research focuses on domain-specific IE.
We picked the sports domain, particularly, texts
on soccer matches because the number and types
of entities, relations and linguistic structures are
representative for many applications.
Based on the motivations above mentioned,
our goals for the design and implementation of
the prototype system called CHINERIS (Chinese
Named Entity and Relation Identification System)
are:

In the model, the IE processing is divided into
three stages: (i) word segmentation and part-of-
speech (POS) tagging; (ii) NE recognition; (iii)
NER identification. Figure 1 demonstrates a Chi-
nese IE computational model comprised of these
three stages. Each component in the system cor-
responds to a stage.
After the recognition for NEs, NER identifica-
tion is performed in the last stage. Because of the
diversity and complexity of NERs, at the same
time, considering portability requirement in the
identification, we suggest a novel supervised
machine learning approach called positive and
negative case-based learning (PNCBL) used in
this stage (Yao and Uszkoreit, 2005).
The learning in this approach is a variant of
Texts from Internet or Disk memory-based learning (Daelemans et al., 2000).

In general, the accuracy of the first stage has
considerable influence on the performance of the
consequent two stages. It has been demonstrated
by our experiments (Yao et al., 2002). In order to
reduce unfavorable influence, we utilize a train-
able approach (Brill, 1995) to automatically gen-
erate effective rules, by which the first compo-
nent can repair different errors caused by word
segmentation and POS tagging.
At the second stage, there are two kinds of NE
constructions to be processed (Yao et al., 2003).
One is the NEs which involve trigger words; the
other those without trigger words. For the former
NEs, a shallow parsing mechanism, i.e., finite-
state cascades (FSC) (Abney, 1996) which are
automatically constructed by sets of NE recogni-
tion rules, is adopted for reliably identifying dif-
ferent categories of NEs. For the latter NEs,
however, some special strategies, such as the
valence constraints of domain verbs, the con-
stituent analysis of NE candidates, the global
context clues and the analysis for preposition
objects etc., are designed for identifying them.
The goal of that is to capture valuable informa-
tion from NER and non-NER patterns, which is
implicated in different features. Because not all
features we predefine are necessary for each
NER or non-NER, we should select them by a
reasonable measure mode. According to the se-
lection criterion we propose - self-similarity,
which is a quantitative measure for the concen-
trative degree of the same kind of NERs or non-
NERs in the corresponding pattern library, the
effective feature sets - General-Character Feature
(GCF) sets for NERs and Individual-Character
Feature (ICF) sets for non-NERs are built. More-
over, the GCF and ICF feature weighting serve
as a proportion determination of feature’s degree
of importance for identifying NERs against non-
NERs. Subsequently, identification thresholds
can also be determined.
Therefore, this approach pursues the im-
provement of the identification performance for
NERs by simultaneously learning two opposite
cases, automatically selecting effective multi-
level linguistic features from a predefined feature
set for each NER and non-NER, and optimally
making an identification tradeoff. Further, two
other strategies, resolving relationship conflicts
and inferring missing relationships, are also inte-
grated in this stage.
Considering the actual requirements for do-
main knowledge, we defined a hierarchical tax-
onomy and constructed conceptual relationships
among Object, Movement and Property concept
categories under the taxonomy in a lexical sports
ontology (Yao, 2005). Thus, this ontology can be
used for the recognition of NEs with special con-
structions - without trigger words, the determina-
tion of NE boundaries, and the provision of fea-
ture values as well as the computation of the se-
mantic distance for two concepts during the iden-
tification of NERs.

used in the system development. In order to
avoid repeated development, we integrate other
application system and resource, e.g., Modern
Chinese Word Segmentation and POS Tagging
System (Liu, 2000) and HowNet (Dong and
Dong, 2000) into the system. Additionally, we
utilize Protégé-2000 (version 1.9) (Stanford
Medical Informatics, 2003) as a development
environment for the implementation of lexical
sports ontology.
The prototype system CHINERIS has been
implemented in Java. The system can automati-
cally identify 6 types of NEs1 and 14 types of
NERs2 in the sports domain. Furthermore, its
run-time efficiency is acceptable and the system
user interfaces are friendly.

In the first experiment, the training set consists

from the soccer matches of the Jie Fang Daily

ror repair rules. They can repair at least one error
in the training corpus. The rules in the rule li-
brary are ranked according to the errors they cor-

testing set have been randomly chosen from the
Jie Fang Daily from May 2002. In the testing, the
usage of error repair rules with context con-
straints has priority over those without context
constraints, and the usage of error repair rules for
word segmentation has priority over those for
POS tagging. Through experimental observation,
this processing sequence can ensure that the rules
repair many more errors. On the other hand, it
can prevent new errors occurring during the re-
pair of existing errors. The results indicate that
after the correction, the average F-measure of
word segmentation has increased from 87.75 %
to 92.86%; while that of POS tagging has even
increased from 77.47% to 90.01%. That is to say,
the performance of both processes has been dis-
tinctly enhanced.
In the second experiment, we utilize the same
testing set for the error repair component to
check the named entity identification which in-
cludes regular and special entity constructions.
The rule sets provided for TN, CT, and PI recog-
nition have 35, 50, and 20 rules respectively. In
lexical sports ontology, there are more than 350
domain verbs used for the identification of TN
with special constructions. Among six NEs, the
average F-measure of DT, PI, and CT exceeds
85%. Therefore, it specifies that the identifica-
tion performance of named entities after adding
the special recognition strategies in this compo-
nent has reached a good level.
In the third experiment, both pattern libraries
are established in terms of the annotated texts
and lexical sports ontology during learning. They
have 142 (534 NERs) and 98 (572 non-NERs)
sentence groups respectively. To test the per-
formance of our approach, we randomly choose
32 sentence groups from the Jie Fang Daily in
2002 (these sentence groups are out of either
NER or non-NER pattern library), which em-
body 117 different NER candidates. Table 1
shows the total average recall, precision, and F-
measure for 14 different NERs by positive and
negative case-based learning and identification.
Among 14 types of NERs, the highest total aver-
age F-measure is 95.65 from the relation
LOC_CPC and the lowest total average F-
measure is 34.09 from TM_CPC. The total aver-
age F-measure is 70.46. In addition, we also
compared the performance between the total av-
erage recall, precision, and F-measure for all
NERs only by positive and by positive and nega-
tive case-based learning and identification sepa-
rately. It shows the total average F-measure is
enhanced from 63.61% to 70.46% as a whole,

due to the adoption of both positive and negative
cases.
From the result, we also realize that the selec-
tion of relation features is critical. First, they
should be selected from multiple linguistic levels,
., morphology, syntax and semantics. Second,
they should also embody the crucial information
of Chinese language processing, such as word
order, the context of words, and particles etc.
Moreover, the proposed self-similarity is a rea-
sonable measure for selecting GCF and ICF for
NERs and non-NERs identification respectively.

5 Conclusion

<bodyText confidence="0.998421763157895">
This three-stage IE prototype system CHINERIS
is propriate and
ap effective for Chinese named
entit and relation identifi
y cation in sports domain.
In the first component, it is a beneficial explo-
ration to develop an error repairer which simul-
taneously enhances the performance of Chinese
word segmentation and POS tagging.
In the second component, we theoretically ex-
tend the original definition of Finite State Auto-
mata (FSA), that is, we use complex constraint
symbols rather than atomic constraint symbols.
With this extension, we improve the practicabil-
ity for the FSC mechanism. At the same time, the
new issue for automatically constructing FSC
also increases the flexibility of its maintenance.
In order to improve the NE identification per-
formance, some special strategies for the identi-
fication of NEs without trigger words are added
in this stage, which cannot be recognized by FSC.
In the third component, automatically select-
ing effectual multi-level linguistic features for
each NER and non-NER and learning two oppo-
site types of cases simultaneously are two inno-
vative points in the PNCBL approach.
The lexical sports ontology plays an important
role in the identification of NEs and NERs, such
as determination of the boundary of NE s, identi-
fic
ation for NE with special constructons and
calculation of similarity for the features (e.g. se-
mantic distance).
The experimental results for the three compo-
nents in the prototype system show that the sys-
tem CHINERIS is successful for the sample ap-
pl
ication.

Figure 1 demonstrates a Chinese IE computational model comprised of these three stages. Each component in the system corresponds to a stage. After the recognition for NEs, NER identification is performed in the last stage. Because of the diversity and complexity of NERs, at the same time, considering portability requirement in the identification, we suggest a novel supervised machine learning approach called positive and negative case-based learning (PNCBL) used in this stage (Yao and Uszkoreit, 2005).

Further, two other strategies, resolving relationship conflicts and inferring missing relationships, are also integrated in this stage. Considering the actual requirements for domain knowledge, we defined a hierarchical taxonomy and constructed conceptual relationships among Object, Movement and Property concept categories under the taxonomy in a lexical sports ontology (Yao, 2005). Thus, this ontology can be used for the recognition of NEs with special constructions - without trigger words, the determination of NE boundaries, and the provision of feature values as well as the computation of the semantic distance for two concepts during the identification of NERs. 3 System Imple mentation During the implementation, object-oriented design and programming methods are thoroughly Word Seg. and POS Tag.
