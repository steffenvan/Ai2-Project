Linguistic and Computational Techniques
in Machine Translation System Design
(second edition)

</note>

(Sharp Laboratories of Europe; late of UMIST)
London: UCL Press (Studies in
Computational Linguistics, edited by
Harold Somers), 1995, xii+208 pp;
hardbound, ISBN 1-85728-216-7, £30.00
This is a slightly enhanced second edition
of the 1983 report 84/2 of the Centre for
Computational Linguistics at UMIST in Man-
chester, England. As Harold Somers states in
the preface to this edition, &amp;quot;it was the first at-
tempt anyone had made to take a critical and
objective look at the details of MT systems.&amp;quot;
This explains to a large extent the interest
it may arouse and justifies to some extent its
(re)publication within the Studies in Compu-
tational Linguistics series a decade after its
original completion.
The book comprises two parts. Part I
is a concise general discussion about ma-
chine translation (MT). It covers succinctly
the linguistic and computational informa-
tion necessary to be able to follow the sec-
ond part of the book. Part II surveys, in
great detail, and evaluates six MT systems:
SYSTRAN, TAUM-Meteo, TAUM Aviation,
GETA Ariane-78, Yorick Wilks&apos;s Preferential
Semantics (PS) system, and METAL. Neither
of the authors were involved in the develop-
ment of any of these software projects. They
did, however, have an in-depth understand-
ing of the intricacies of the systems, having
collected numerous relevant reports and in-
ternal memos. Their description is given in a
relatively clear, easy-to-follow manner with-
out compromising on technical detail. Harold
Somers has provided a number of additional
footnotes trying to put (part of) the discus-
sion into a mid-90&apos;s perspective.
The book is not, nor does it claim to be,
either an introduction to MT or a general
reference book on MT. In essence, it is a
critical, detailed description of the six afore-
mentioned MT systems. Somers claims in the
preface that &amp;quot;this effort has not yet been du-
plicated.&amp;quot; As humble as he may be, the facts
are that by the time he wrote this preface (De-
cember 1993) Somers himself had already co-
authored Hutchins and Somers (1992). The
latter is a widely available introductory MT
textbook and reference book that contains, in-
ter alia, four full chapters dedicated to criti-
cal, detailed descriptions of most of these MT
systems (all excepting TAUM Aviation and
Wilks&apos;s PS system). Although Hutchins and
Somers may seem at times to exhibit more
of a socio-historical interest than a technical
one—in contrast to the book under review—
nonetheless, they too go into substantial tech-
nical detail and give overall comparable de-
scriptions. The effort, thus, has actually been
duplicated to a significant extent, casting cer-
tain doubt on any serious need for this sec-
ond (partially redundant) edition of White-
lock and Kilby&apos;s book.
To summarize, the book is interesting, well
written, not too thick, and easily read. How-
ever, unless one is explicitly interested in
detailed critical descriptions of TAUM Avi-
ation or Wilks&apos;s PS system, then Hutchins
and Somers (1992)—which covers most of
that discussed by Whitelock and Kilby and
much much more—should probably suffice.
This renders the book under review some-
what dispensable.—Daniel Radzinski, Lexical

This book proved itself, literally, to be a very
effective survey of the recent work in a va-
riety of approaches to learning natural lan-
guage. I began reading this book while on a
flight to attend the third International Collo-
quium on Grammatical Inference (ICGI-96),

grammatical inference of natural language.
By the end of the book, and the flight, I had
completely rethought the introduction to my
talk.
The book is a collection of revised pa-
pers from a workshop at the 1995 Interna-
tional Joint Conference on Artificial Intelli-
gence, with a very worthwhile introduction
written by the members of the workshop or-
ganizing committee. As the title implies, the
book is divided into three sections: connec-
tionist networks and hybrid approaches, sta-
tistical approaches, and symbolic approaches
to language learning.
Most of the selections in the first sec-
tion are proof-of-concept papers, in contrast
to the more results-oriented papers in the
other two sections. The reader is left with
the impression that while there is interest-
ing work being done in applying neural net-
works and genetic algorithms to language
learning, the approach is still in its infancy,
and lags somewhat behind the statistical and
symbolic movements. For example, the final
paper in the section, &amp;quot;Learning language us-
ing genetic algorithms,&amp;quot; by Smith and Wit-
ten, established the robustness of its proposed
learning algorithm by trying to learn the rule
S NP VP from a half-dozen five- and six-
word sentences.
With this book, Wermter, Riloff, and
Scheler have done a commendable job of
providing the community with a good start-
ing point for exploring these very differ-
ent approaches to the problem of language
learning.—David M. Magerman, Renaissance

Although written primarily for students in
audiology, speech pathology, and related ar-

linguist who wants to learn the practical as-
pects of electronics for collecting and ana-
lyzing speech data. The book assumes that
the reader has no scientific or technical back-
ground. The topics covered include the fol-
lowing: the basics of setting up and connect-
ing equipment; microphones and other trans-
ducers; amplifiers, attenuators, mixers, and
filters; digital signal processing; spectrum
analysis; digital and analogue tape recording;
and instrumentation for studying the physi-
