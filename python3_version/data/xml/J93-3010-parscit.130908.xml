Those of us who study linguistic pragmatic
phenomena such as implicature and indi-
rection take very seriously the view that
language is action—indeed, is intentional
action—and we generally ground our ex-
planations of these phenomena in theories
of action and intention. In Agency in Action,
S. C. Coval and P. G. Campbell develop a
philosophical theory of action that is distin-
guished by its identification of an action with
&amp;quot;those and only those properties intended of
the event caused by the intentional state of
the agent [who performs the event]&amp;quot; (p. 14).
The book is divided into two main parts.
In the first part, Chapters 1-4, the authors de-
velop their theory of action. Chapter 1 begins
by reviewing the main alternative theories of
action, &apos;grading&apos; each in terms of how well
it meets a set of five criteria that the authors
feel constitute desiderata for any such the-
ory. For example, they claim that any useful
theory of action should model actions as the
right type of thing to participate in a causa-
tion relation, and should provide a basis for
moral appraisal. Not surprisingly, Coval and
Campbell find all the alternatives lacking on
at least one of the criteria. They then present
their main idea—that actions should be seen
as objects that explicitly reveal their own in-
tentional cause—and suggest that a theory
built around this idea will successfully meet
all five criteria. Chapters 2-4 are devoted to
the working out of this theory.
The second part of the book consists of
a chapter (Chapter 5) that describes a com-
puter program called PRAGMA, the Practi-
cal Rational Agency Machine. PRAGMA was
designed to test the consistency of the au-
thors&apos; theory. A PRAGMA user inputs the
description of &amp;quot;an agency case&amp;quot;, i.e., some
agent-generated event. PRAGMA guides the
user by asking a series of questions about
what the agent intended, what actually oc-
curred, what the agent believed about the
relationship between what was intended
and what occurred, and so on. PRAGMA
can then use this information to determine
whether, according to Coval and Campbell&apos;s
theory, the event should be considered to be
an (intentional) action, or whether instead it
should be considered unintentional or mis-
taken or inadvertent. The system does this by
performing pattern matching using the input
information, which it stores in a data struc-
ture called an Object Frame, and a set of def-
initions of mistake, inadvertence, etc., given
in terms of the slots of an Object Frame.
Coval and Campbell&apos;s prose is often an-
noyingly turgid, and their convoluted nota-
tion for representing actions, intentions, de-
sires, and the relations between these is un-
likely to appeal to the computer scientist. In
addition, although there remain many dif-
ficult and fascinating open questions sur-
rounding linguistic pragmatics, it is not clear
that the main theoretical move made in this
book, to wit, shifting the boundary between
intention and action simpliciter, will be of
much immediate use in addressing those
questions.—Martha E. Pollack, University of
Pittsburgh

Working with Foreign Languages and

WordPerfect is considered by many work-
ers in the field to be the best word process-
ing software for linguists. And Peter Kahrel
gives an in-depth explanation why this is
the case. In its latest versions (WordPerfect
5.1 and WordPerfect for Windows), the pro-
gram supports about 1900 different charac-
ters, including characters with diacritics for
many Latin-alphabet European languages,
the Greek, Hebrew, and Cyrillic alphabets,
and two Japanese scripts. Kahrel explains
how you can have all these characters at your
fingertips. Advanced users will learn how to
tailor the keyboard to their needs, how to
modify existing fonts, and how to create new
ones.
According to Kahrel, WordPerfect offers
20 language modules. This includes four
modules for English (American, Australian,
British, and Canadian), two modules for Ger-
man (Standard and Swiss) and Portuguese
(Brazil and Portugal). A complete language
module contains a hyphenation module, a
spelling checker, and a thesaurus. (Some lan-
guage modules are not complete.) Kahrel not
only explains how to use the hyphenation
module and the spelling checker, but also
how to customize and extend each to per-
sonal needs.
The great advantage of the WordPerfect
setup is that you need only one copy of the
general word processing system, and you can
buy the language modules separately. You
can even apply different language modules
within a single document.
The book is a must for every linguist work-
ing with WordPerfect. It presupposes basic
knowledge about the software, but it will cer-
tainly give the novice a good taste of what
WordPerfect offers to authors of multilingual
documents. It will provide the experienced
WordPerfect user with many insights into the
linguistic aspects of the software.
With the book comes a disk containing
the WordPerfect macros that are introduced
in the book. I tested two of them. The first
changes all footnotes and endnotes of a doc-
ument to regular text, appending it at the
end of the file. The macro did not work
properly on my computer, but I could fix
it within minutes. (Readers who need the
fix may write to me at volk@informatik.uni-
koblenz.de.) The second macro transliterates
Greek texts into Latin texts, and it worked
nicely.—Martin Volk, University of Koblenz-
