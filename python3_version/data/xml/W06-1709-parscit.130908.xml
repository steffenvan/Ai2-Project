Some languages’ orthographic properties
allow written data to be used for phono-
logical research. This paper reports on an
on-going project that uses a web-derived
text corpus to study the phonology of
Tagalog, a language for which large cor-
pora are not otherwise available. Novel
findings concerning the phenomenon of
intervocalic tapping are discussed in de-
tail, and an overview of other phonologi-
cal phenomena in the language that can
be investigated through written data is
given.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.997234233333333">
Because the field of phonology studies sound
patterns of languages, corpus-based phonology
typically relies on audio corpora. These are ex-
pensive to create, and usually must undergo labo-
rious hand-tagging to be useful. For much pho-
nological investigation, there is no way around
these harsh facts. Sometimes, however, a lan-
guage’s phonology and orthography conspire to
allow phonological data to be gleaned from text.
Abigail Cohn and Lisa Lavoie (p.c.), for exam-
ple, have used text data on English comparatives
to determine whether words are treated as mono-
syllabic, taking suffixal X-er, or longer, taking
periphrastic more X. The cases of interest are
words such as feel and fire, which have a tense or
diphthongal nucleus followed by l or r, and are
felt by many English speakers to be longer than
monosyllabic. Corpus data on the frequencies of
the two comparative types can be used as further
evidence on the status of such words.
The Tagalog language (Austronesian, Philip-
pines) exhibits several morphophonological phe-
nomena that are reflected in its spelling. All of
these phenomena involve some variation, which
makes them ideal for text-corpus study: only
with large amounts of data can we investigate the
distribution of the variants and search for the fac-
tors that condition the variation. See Schachter &amp;
Otanes (1972) for basic descriptions of most of
these phenomena:

<listItem confidence="0.999278517241379">
• intervocalic tapping (d can become the
tap sound [r], spelled r, when it is be-
tween two vowels): dumi ‘dirt’ ma-rumi
‘dirty’
• vowel-height alternations (o in final syl-
lables can alternate with u in non-final
syllables; there is a similar but more
complicated i/e alternation): halo ‘mix’
halu-in ‘to be mixed’
• nasal assimilation (a nasal consonant can
take on the place of articulation of a fol-
lowing consonant): pam-butas ‘borer’
pan-damot ‘picker-upper’ pang-gamas
‘trowel’ (ng represents the velar nasal

• nasal substitution (stem-initial obstruents
can turn into nasals when certain pre-
fixes are added): pili ‘choosing’ ma-mili
‘to choose’
• syncope (the vowel of a stem’s final syl-
lable can be deleted when a suffix is
added, and the consonants that conse-
quently become adjacent can undergo
changes): gawa ‘act’ gaw_-in ‘to be
done’, tingin ‘look’ tig_n-an ‘to be

Variation in some of these phenomena has
been investigated previously (Ross 1996 for par-
tial reduplication; Rackowski 1999 for location
of reduplication), sometimes using dictionary
counts to obtain statistics (Zuraw 2002 for vowel
height; Zuraw 2000 for nasal substitution). Cor-
pus frequencies of the variants, however, or even
basic word frequencies, have not previously been
available.
As should be apparent from the examples
given above, which are all in normal Tagalog
spelling except for the hyphens added to show
morpheme boundaries (hyphens are used in Tag-
alog, but not in the locations shown above), all of
these phonological phenomena can be investi-
gated in a text corpus. In most cases, modulo
typing errors, we can be confident that the writ-
ten form represents the writer’s intended pronun-
ciation, especially since spell-checking software
that would change a writer’s original spelling is
not widely used for Tagalog, and there is little
prescriptive pressure favoring one variant spell-
ing over the other.1 One area in which we should
be cautious is partial reduplication, however: in a
spelling such as nag-fri-friendster, it is plausible
first that the writer might pronounce the stem in
a nativized fashion despite preserving the Eng-
lish spelling (e.g., with [p] instead of [f]2), and
second that regardless of intended stem pronun-
ciation, the reduplicant’s spelling is merely an
echo of the stem’s spelling, and does not reflect
the writer’s pronunciation.

Section 2 below describes how a written cor-
pus of Tagalog was constructed from the web.
Section 3 gives results from the corpus on tap-
ping, and Section 4 concludes.
2 Construction of the corpus
Like most of the world’s 6,000 or so languages,
Tagalog is a language for which carefully con-
structed, tagged corpora (written or audio) do not
exist. However, unlike most of the world’s lan-
guages, Tagalog has a substantial web presence.
As with all web-as-corpus endeavors, there is the
drawback that the data will be messier, and there
will be more input from non-native speakers than
in, say, a newspaper-derived corpus. But in the
case of some phenomena, such as infix location,
a web corpus is actually preferable to a newspa-
per-derived corpus (if one existed): the range of
loanwords found in formal Tagalog writing is
narrower, favoring Spanish loans over English,
than that found in the highly informal writing of
blogs and web forums. From this informal writ-
ing we can obtain data on how the language’s
grammar is being extended to the novel phono-
logical situations presented by a wide range of
English loans.
A previous demonstration project (Ghani,
Jones and Mladenic 2004) showed how a corpus
of Tagalog can be created from the web by con-
structing queries designed to target Tagalog-
language pages and exclude pages in other lan-
guages; the queries are created by using a small
seed corpus to estimate word frequencies, and
the frequencies are updated as the corpus grows.
Kevin Scannell’s An Crúbadán project
(http://borel.slu.edu/crubadan/index.html), which
seems to work in a similar fashion, includes a
Tagalog language model. BootCaT (Baroni &amp;
Bernardini 2004), which is designed to create
corpora and discover multi-word terms in spe-
cialized domains, such as psychiatry, works simi-
larly, with the added twist that queries use words
that are more frequent in the target domain than
in a reference corpus. The method used here is
similar, though cruder. No attempt is made to
exclude pages written partly or even mostly in a
language other than Tagalog; many blogs, for
instance, are overwhelmingly in English but with
occasional sprinklings of Tagalog, and I wanted
to obtain these sprinklings, because they are rich
in nonce affixed forms of loanwords.3

In order to construct the corpus used here, first
a smaller corpus of mainly Tagalog web pages,
generously supplied by Rosie Jones (derived
from Ghani, Jones and Mladenic 2004) was
processed in order to yield estimated word fre-
quencies for Tagalog.
Using these frequencies, a long list of queries
composed of frequent words is automatically
generated. Each term is at least 12 characters
long, including spaces but not including apostro-
phes or other non-alphabetic characters. A word
is chosen from among the most frequent 500 in
the starter corpus, with a probability proportional
to its log frequency. If this produces a 12-
character string, the query is complete. Other-
wise, another word is chosen using the same pro-
cedure and added to the string, until the threshold
of 12 characters is reached. This threshold was
selected in order to ensure queries long enough
to be specifically Tagalog (e.g., not sa ng), but
short enough to yield a large number of web hits.
Some sample queries: kami pangulo, +at salita
oo,4 lalo parang, noong akin aklat. Although
these queries are not treated as phrases, the order
produced by the query-generator was preserved,
because the topmost hits produced by, e.g., lalo
parang and parang lalo are not the same. It is
important to “toss the salad”5 in this way, be-
cause the Google search engine that these queries
are sent to allows only the top 1,000 results of a
query to be viewed.
A program that sends these queries to Google
(www.google.com), using the Google web APIs
service, was written by Ivan Tam. This returns a
maximum of 10,000 URLs (web addresses) per
day, because a user’s license key allows only
1,000 queries per day, and each query return only
10 results—to see more than the top 10 results
for a given query, a new query must be sent,
which counts against the day’s 1,000. Typically,
the number of URLs retrieved was about 5,000.
This is because the number of times the program
asks to see more results for a given query is de-
termined by the estimated number of results ini-
log-language documents from the web, because this would
require hand identification of their results (or of a large
body of test documents). Qualitatively, however, the Ghani
et al. approach does seem to suffer the same main problem
as mine: a sizeable number of documents from Philippine
languages other than Tagalog are retrieved.
4 A “+” was added by hand to a few members of the top-500
list that Google would otherwise ignore because they are
common function words in English or another major lan-
guage. Quotations are placed around words with crucial
punctuation, such as apostrophes in contractions.

tially reported by Google, but this is often an
overestimate. For example, Google may estimate
that there are 800 results, and the program will
thus ask to see 80 pages of results (using up 80
of the day’s queries), but perhaps only 621 re-
sults will be obtained. (The program gives the
user the option of setting a maximum number of
results to obtain per query; setting this number
lower makes more efficient use of the day’s
query quota.)
Tam’s program gives the option of taking us-
ing Google’s option to return, out of any subset
of results from one query that are highly similar,
just one URL. That option was used here, but no
further attempt was made to exclude highly simi-
lar results that come from different queries—
obviously, this is an area where the procedure
could be improved. The program also offers the
option, which was used here, to create a separate
query to search any crowded hosts (Google tends
to show only two results from a single server,
returning a “More results from ...” link; in the
results returned by the Google Web APIs service,
this translates into a non-blank value for
&lt;hostName&gt;).
The day’s URLs are compared against those
retrieved so far, and the new ones are extracted.
Another part of Tam’s program then retrieves the
full text of each new URL, although an existing
program such as wget could also be used. Be-
cause the data of interest in this project are uni-
gram and bigram frequencies, and irrelevant bi-
grams such as “a href” (a frequent bigram in
html code) play no role, html stripping was not
performed.
The resulting corpus currently has 98,607
pages and an estimated 20 million words of Tag-
alog (200 million “words” total, but examination
of a sample finds that when html tags and non-
Tagalog text are removed, about 10% remains).
Word frequencies and certain bigram frequencies
(e.g., the word+enclitic frequencies discussed
below) are obtained from this corpus.

3 Tapping in the corpus
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999979666666666">
The phenomenon investigated most recently in
the corpus is tapping. As mentioned above,
Tagalog has a rule taking /d/ to the tap [f]
(spelled r) between vowels; tap rarely occurs
non-intervocalically, except in loanwords (Span-
ish [f] and [r], and English [.z] are usually
adapted as [f]). There are no opportunities for d/r
alternation in affixes, but there are stems that
begin or end in d, and if a vowel-final prefix or

<bodyText confidence="0.999960578947368">
vowel-initial suffix is attached, the potential for
tapping arises. Tapping has been reported to be
variable at the prefix-stem boundary (ma-rumi
‘dirty’ vs. ma-dahon ‘leafy’) but obligatory at the
stem-suffix boundary (lakar-an ‘to be walked
on’, from lakad ‘walk’) (Schachter and Otanes
1972). This is reminiscent of phenomena such as
s-voicing in Northern Italian, which authors such
as Nespor and Vogel (1986) and Peperkamp
(1997) have analyzed as involving an asymmetry
in how prefixes and suffixes relate to the pro-
sodic word. For the sake of brevity, I will not
review the Northern Italian facts here, but will
apply an analysis similar to Peperkamp’s to the
Tagalog tapping case. (Peperkamp points out that
prefix/suffix asymmetries always seem to be in
this direction: prefixes are prosodically less inte-
grated with stems than are suffixes.)
If we assume, as a first approximation, that a
suffix is incorporated into the same prosodic
word (p-word) as its stem, while a prefix adjoins
to the stem to form a higher p-word, and we fur-
ther assume that tapping applies only to a vowel-
d-vowel stretch that is not interrupted by a p-
word boundary, then we would predict that tap-
ping occurs at the stem-suffix boundary but not
at the prefix-stem boundary:
Loosely following Peperkamp, I will assume
that this prosodification is derived by a constraint
requiring the left edge of any accessed lexical
unit (see below) to project the left edge of a p-
word. In Optimality Theory terms (Prince &amp;
Smolensky 1993/2004), the symmetrical con-
straint requiring the right edge of an accessed
lexical unit to project any prosodic edge is
ranked lower (specifically, below an anti-
recursion constraint requiring every p-word node
to immediately dominate a foot).

3.1 Tapping at the prefix-stem boundary
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999579666666667">
How can we explain ma-rumi, where tapping
does occur at the prefix-stem boundary? In the
Northern Italian case, Baroni (2001) found that
application of the s-voicing rule at the prefix-
stem boundary in a reading task was negatively
correlated with semantic transparency as deter-
mined by a rating task. Baroni’s interpretation is
that forms with voicing (which tend to be seman-
tically opaque) are treated as morphologically
simple. I will follow Baroni loosely in assuming
that words like marumi are accessed as a single
lexical unit (without taking a position on whether
that lexical entry contains information about
morpheme boundaries). If marumi is accessed as
a lexical unit—rather than indirectly via ma- and
dumi—then the constraint mentioned above re-
quires only the left edge of the whole word to
project a p-word boundary, and the structure is as
in Figure 2. Because no p-word boundary inter-
rupts the vowel-d-vowel sequence, tapping ap-
plies.

The corpus does not directly yield judgments
of semantic transparency, of course—though in-
direct measures using the similarity of contexts
in which the derived word and its base occur
could be examined in future work—but it does
yield a statistic that Hay (2003) has argued is
closely related to the degree to which a morpho-
logically complex word is treated as a single unit
vs. compositionally: the ratio of base frequency
to derived-word frequency. Hay argues, based on
a series of experiments on English, that when a
derived word is more frequent than its morpho-
logical base (e.g., English illegible vs. legible), it
is more likely to be accessed through a direct
route during processing (direct access to illegible
rather than access via in- and legible), and thus
more likely to be treated as a single unit phonol-
ogically, and more likely to develop independent
semantics. The prediction that can be tested in
the Tagalog corpus is this: prefixed words that
are more frequent than their unprefixed bases are
more likely to undergo tapping than prefixed
words that are less frequent than their unprefixed
bases.
To minimize hand-checking of items, the cor-
pus was searched only for the 592 orthographi-
cally distinct prefixed d-stem words that appear
in a dictionary of Tagalog (English 1986). These
words were extracted from the dictionary and put
into electronic form by Nikki Foster. The fre-
quency of each word’s tapped and untapped form

were retrieved from the corpus (e.g., for the dic-
tionary’s i-dipa, both idipa and iripa’s frequen-
cies were obtained). Dictionary-listed variants
were searched, and certain punctuation was al-
lowed. “Linkers” were also allowed (these are
clitics that can become, orthographically, part of
the preceding word). The frequency of each
word’s root, as listed in the dictionary, was also
retrieved. (In the case of words with multiple
affixes, it is unclear what the immediate morpho-
logical predecessor is, so for the sake of simplic-
ity the root, rather than some intermediate form,
was used.)
The histograms below show how many pre-
fixed words display each range of tapping rates
in the corpus, from 0 (always d) to 1 (always r).
They demonstrate the predicted influence of de-
rived/base frequency ratio on tapping rate: when
the prefixed word is more frequent than its root
(Figure 3), a high rate of tapping predominates
(strongly), whereas when the root is more fre-
quent than the prefixed word (Figure 4), a low
rate of tapping predominates (weakly):

Interestingly, in both cases the rates of tapping
cluster near 0 and 1—intermediate rates are rela-
tively rare. The data above are limited to words
with a corpus frequency of at least 10, so that
each word had a fair chance of displaying an in-
termediate rate of tapping if that were its true
behavior. This suggests that the great majority of
prefixed words in Tagalog are lexicalized as ei-
ther undergoing or not undergoing tapping (or,
depending on what form lexical entries in fact
take, as having one prosodic structure or the
other). This is rather different from the Northern
Italian situation discovered by Baroni, where
many words robustly vary, even within a single
speaker.
Words with a corpus frequency of less than
10, which are almost all less frequent than their
bases, show a preference of non-tapping, as ex-
pected:

Hay argues that it is relative frequency of a de-
rived word and its base, not raw frequency of the
derived word, that models of lexical access pre-
dict to have an effect on word decomposability.
In the present case, raw frequency does also have
effect on whether a prefixed word be-
longs to the tapping or non-tapping categories,
but raw and relative frequency are themselves
highly correlated. In order to verify that relative
frequency has an effect independent of raw fre-
quency, the prefixed words were divided into 28
categories according to the log of their raw fre-
quency (0 to &lt;0.1, 0.3 to &lt;0.4, 0.4 to &lt;0.5, etc.).
Within each category, the percentage of words
less frequent than their bases that undergo tap-
ping &gt;95% of the time and the percentage of
words more frequent than their bases that un-
dergo tapping &gt;95% of the time were calculated.
The prediction is that the second percentage
should be higher—that is, words matched for raw
frequency should be more likely to undergo tap-
ping if they are more frequent than their bases—
and this was borne out in a Wilcoxon signed-

Tapping was examined in a similar fashion at the
stem-suffix boundary. From English’s (1986)
dictionary, 160 native-etymology roots that end
in d were extracted, and the corpus was searched
for any suffixed forms of these roots (with or
without additional prefixes and infixes). As ex-
pected from Schachter and Otanes’s (1972) de-
scription, tapping is indeed nearly obligatory at
the stem-suffix boundary, as shown in Figure 6
(which again shows only words with corpus fre-
quency of at least 10):

<bodyText confidence="0.99998709375">
Because of the relative ease of searching for
suffixed forms (there are only two productive
native suffixes in Tagalog, -in and -an, so a sim-
ple regular expression can find all the suffixed
forms of any root), the counts here are much
higher than in the prefix-stem case—compare the
scales of the vertical axes in the histograms—and
we can look more closely at the 124 words—a
minority so small it is largely invisible in Figure
6—that do not uniformly undergo tapping at the
stem-suffix boundary. Rate of tapping among
these 124 words turns out to be weakly but sig-
nificantly correlated with the log ratio of suffix-
word frequency to root frequency (Spearman’s
rho=.534, p&lt;.001), as predicted by Hay’s view of
phonological integration.
There are multiple possible interpretations for
this result under the prosodic account given
above. Perhaps stem and suffix do always form a
single p-word, but paradigm-uniformity effects
(e.g., Steriade 2000) can, if sufficiently strong,
block tapping even within a p-word. Or, perhaps
the requirement that a suffix be integrated into
the prosodic word can itself be overridden, occa-
sionally, by frequency effects demanding a com-
positional treatment of an affixed word that is
less frequent than its base.6 It is also possible that
all the “nontapping” here represents typographi-
cal errors, but that there is a frequency effect on
errors such that the more frequent a base relative
to the word it is nested inside, the more likely
that the base’s spelling is preserved.

The prosodic system assumed above (with some
constraints not mentioned there), allows a com-
bination of two stems to have either of the pro-
sodic structures shown in Figure 7, with the
choice depending on whether the combination is
accessed as a single lexical unit. But in either
case, a p-word boundary separates the two stems,
and thus tapping is not expected on either side of
the stem-stem boundary.

There are two places where a stem+stem com-
bination could arise in Tagalog. One is in com-
pounds, such as basag-ulo ‘fight’ (lit. breaking-
head), where each member bears a separate
stress. If we assume, following most previous
work on the p-word, that dominating a stressed
syllable is a necessary feature of a p-word
(though not sufficient, since a single p-word may
contain multiple stresses), this is consistent with
a p-word+p-word prosodic structure. Lacking a
list of compounds, however, I found it impracti-
cal to search for compounds in the corpus
(though this is a project for the future).
The second place where stem-stem boundaries
arguably arise is in two-syllable reduplication,
which occurs in a variety of morphological con-
structions, including reduplication by itself: e.g.
pa-balik-balik ‘recurrent’, from balik ‘return’. In
these reduplications, each copy bears a stress.
We would therefore expect that tapping should
not occur at the boundary between the two redu-

6 In Hay’s view, relative frequency is not epiphenomenal,
but rather determines the mode of lexical access (direct or
indirect route) and thus a word’s behavior. It is also possi-
ble, of course, that relative frequency is only the symptom
of some underlying property of words, or that there is feed-
back between frequency and the properties that influence it.

in the histogram below, though the data come

The lack of tapping is unlikely to be a redupli-
cative identity effect (Wilbur 1973, McCarthy
and Prince 1995), because tapping is blocked
even when the other copy of the same consonant
does undergo tapping because of an adjacent pre-
fix or suffix (ka-agad-agar-an, ka-raga-daga-_n
[glosses unknown—English’s dictionary con-
tains both roots but not these derivatives of
them]).
The lack of tapping is also probably not due to
the reduplicated forms’ low frequency: most are
indeed less frequent than their bases, but it was
seen above that prefixed words that are less fre-
quent than their bases undergo tapping almost as
often as not.

3.4 Tapping in clitics
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9907503">
There are two enclitics in Tagalog that begin
with /d/: din ‘also’ and daw ‘(reported speech)’.
Each has a tap-initial allomorph (rin, raw). There
is reported to be variation between the two allo-
morphs even after consonant-final words
(Schachter and Otanes 1972). So far, I have ex-
amined in the corpus only din/rin after vowel-
final words.
All bigrams whose second word is din or rin
were extracted from the corpus. Variation was

7 The interpretation of stem-final d cases is complicated by
the fact that p-words spelled with an initial vowel are usu-
ally actually glottal-stop initial. Thus, agad-agad can be
pronounced with a glottal stop (agad-[2]agad), so that the
medial d is not truly intervocalic.

One interpretation is that most word+clitic
combinations are not lexicalized, and their tap-
ping behavior is determined on the fly. The cor-
relation between the log ratio of bigram to base
word frequency and the rate of tapping, though
very weak, is significant (Spearman’s rho=.197,
p&lt;.0001). If we look at enclitic+din/rin combina-
tions (where the first enclitic ends in a vowel, as
in ... pa rin ‘... still also’), which display simi-
larly gradient variation, the correlation is
stronger, though p is larger because there are
fewer data points (Spearman’s rho=.527, p&lt;.05).

4 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9996746">
This paper has presented one case study, on Tag-
alog tapping, of phonological research using a
written, web-derived corpus. Several aspects of
the investigation depended crucially on the web-
as-corpus method. Because of economic con-
straints, the only realistic way to assemble a
large corpus of a language like Tagalog is cur-
rently by taking text from the web. And only a
large corpus makes it possible to ask questions
such as “how does the frequency ratio of a de-
rived word to its base affect the application of a
phonological rule?” The two different patterns of
variation—polarized in the stem+prefix case,
continuous in the word+enclitic case—would
have been very difficult to discover without cor-
pus data.
This Tagalog corpus has already been used to
investigate infixation in loans that begin with
consonant clusters (Zuraw 2005). There, as men-
tioned in Section 2, the web-based nature of the

corpus was of more than practical importance,
because a large quantity of highly informal writ-
ing—unlikely to be found in a traditionally con-
structed written corpus—was needed.
The corpus is also being used in ongoing work
on nasal substitution, and will be used in the fu-
ture to investigate the other phenomena listed in
Section 1. The corpus will also continue to grow;
there seems to be little danger of running out of
Tagalog-language web space to search in the
foreseeable future.

In the Northern Italian case, Baroni (2001) found that application of the s-voicing rule at the prefixstem boundary in a reading task was negatively correlated with semantic transparency as determined by a rating task. Baroni’s interpretation is that forms with voicing (which tend to be semantically opaque) are treated as morphologically simple.

A previous demonstration project (Ghani, Jones and Mladenic 2004) showed how a corpus of Tagalog can be created from the web by constructing queries designed to target Tagaloglanguage pages and exclude pages in other languages; the queries are created by using a small seed corpus to estimate word frequencies, and the frequencies are updated as the corpus grows. Kevin Scannell’s An Crúbadán project (http://borel.slu.edu/crubadan/index.html), which seems to work in a similar fashion, includes a Tagalog language model. BootCaT (Baroni &amp; Bernardini 2004), which is designed to create corpora and discover multi-word terms in specialized domains, such as psychiatry, works similarly, with the added twist that queries use words that are more frequent in the target domain than in a reference corpus. The method used here is similar, though cruder. No attempt is made to exclude pages written partly or even mostly in a language other than Tagalog; many blogs, for instance, are overwhelmingly in English but with occasional sprinklings of Tagalog, and I wanted to obtain these sprinklings, because they are rich in nonce affixed forms of loanwords.3 3 I h</context>

Hay argues, based on a series of experiments on English, that when a derived word is more frequent than its morphological base (e.g., English illegible vs. legible), it is more likely to be accessed through a direct route during processing (direct access to illegible rather than access via in- and legible), and thus more likely to be treated as a single unit phonologically, and more likely to develop indepen</context>

There are no opportunities for d/r alternation in affixes, but there are stems that begin or end in d, and if a vowel-final prefix or 61 vowel-initial suffix is attached, the potential for tapping arises. Tapping has been reported to be variable at the prefix-stem boundary (ma-rumi ‘dirty’ vs. ma-dahon ‘leafy’) but obligatory at the stem-suffix boundary (lakar-an ‘to be walked on’, from lakad ‘walk’) (Schachter and Otanes 1972). This is reminiscent of phenomena such as s-voicing in Northern Italian, which authors such as Nespor and Vogel (1986) and Peperkamp (1997) have analyzed as involving an asymmetry in how prefixes and suffixes relate to the prosodic word. For the sake of brevity, I will not review the Northern Italian facts here, but will apply an analysis similar to Peperkamp’s to the Tagalog tapping case. (Peperkamp points out that prefix/suffix asymmetries always seem to be in this direction: prefixes are prosodically less integrated with stems than are suffixes.) If we assume, as a first approximation, tha</context>

The lack of tapping is also probably not due to the reduplicated forms’ low frequency: most are indeed less frequent than their bases, but it was seen above that prefixed words that are less frequent than their bases undergo tapping almost as often as not. 3.4 Tapping in clitics There are two enclitics in Tagalog that begin with /d/: din ‘also’ and daw ‘(reported speech)’. Each has a tap-initial allomorph (rin, raw). There is reported to be variation between the two allomorphs even after consonant-final words (Schachter and Otanes 1972). So far, I have examined in the corpus only din/rin after vowelfinal words. All bigrams whose second word is din or rin were extracted from the corpus. Variation was 7 The interpretation of stem-final d cases is complicated by the fact that p-words spelled with an initial vowel are usually actually glottal-stop initial. Thus, agad-agad can be pronounced with a glottal stop (agad-[2]agad), so that the medial d is not truly intervocalic. 0 .2 .4 .6 .8 1 rate of tapping Figure 9.

Corpus data on the frequencies of the two comparative types can be used as further evidence on the status of such words. The Tagalog language (Austronesian, Philippines) exhibits several morphophonological phenomena that are reflected in its spelling. All of these phenomena involve some variation, which makes them ideal for text-corpus study: only with large amounts of data can we investigate the distribution of the variants and search for the factors that condition the variation. See Schachter &amp; Otanes (1972) for basic descriptions of most of these phenomena: • intervocalic tapping (d can become the tap sound [r], spelled r, when it is between two vowels): dumi ‘dirt’ ma-rumi ‘dirty’ • vowel-height alternations (o in final syllables can alternate with u in non-final syllables; there is a similar but more complicated i/e alternation): halo ‘mix’ halu-in ‘to be mixed’ • nasal assimilation (a nasal consonant can take on the place of articulation of a following consonant): pam-butas ‘borer’ pan-damot ‘picker-upper’ pang-gamas ‘trowel’ (ng represents the velar nasal [13]) • nasal substitution (stem-ini</context>

Rate of tapping among these 124 words turns out to be weakly but significantly correlated with the log ratio of suffixword frequency to root frequency (Spearman’s rho=.534, p&lt;.001), as predicted by Hay’s view of phonological integration. There are multiple possible interpretations for this result under the prosodic account given above. Perhaps stem and suffix do always form a single p-word, but paradigm-uniformity effects (e.g., Steriade 2000) can, if sufficiently strong, block tapping even within a p-word. Or, perhaps the requirement that a suffix be integrated into the prosodic word can itself be overridden, occasionally, by frequency effects demanding a compositional treatment of an affixed word that is less frequent than its base.6 It is also possible that all the “nontapping” here represents typographical errors, but that there is a frequency effect on errors such that the more frequent a base relative to the word it is nested inside, the more likely that the base’s spelling is preserved. 3.3 Tapping at the stem-stem boundary </context>

And only a large corpus makes it possible to ask questions such as “how does the frequency ratio of a derived word to its base affect the application of a phonological rule?” The two different patterns of variation—polarized in the stem+prefix case, continuous in the word+enclitic case—would have been very difficult to discover without corpus data. This Tagalog corpus has already been used to investigate infixation in loans that begin with consonant clusters (Zuraw 2005). There, as mentioned in Section 2, the web-based nature of the 65 corpus was of more than practical importance, because a large quantity of highly informal writing—unlikely to be found in a traditionally constructed written corpus—was needed. The corpus is also being used in ongoing work on nasal substitution, and will be used in the future to investigate the other phenomena listed in Section 1. The corpus will also continue to grow; there seems to be little danger of running out of Tagalog-language web space to search in the foreseeable future.
