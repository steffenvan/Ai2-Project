Accultran/Med or just Accultran (for Accurate,
Acculturated Translator) is based, both philosophi-
cally and in terms of implementation, on Life-
Code® NLP system that has been developed at A-
Life Medical for coding and abstracting clinical
documents. Automated Speech Recognition (ASR)
is performed using the SpeechMagicTM system
from Philips, which is currently available for
twenty-three languages.
Many of the techniques employed in Accultran
are established in the practice. Particularly we note
the use of physician directed communication with
yes/no patient responses, back-translation on the
physician side, and the use of multiple choice an-
swer selections for patient responses. Beyond this,
we are exploring the use of CDA2 and SNOMED-
CT as the interlingua for use in those portions of
the encounter where clinical accuracy is essential,
the use of semi-knowledge for recognizing when
an encounter is potentially moving in directions
where cross-cultural communications problems
may arise, and the use of patient waiting time for
patient directed acculturation based on patient
complaint information collected upon presentation.
The primary emphasis here will be on the use of
CDA2 and SNOMED-CT.
Based on observations regarding physician and
patient communication needs during a clinical en-
counter, we divide the clinical encounter into the
following aspects: 1) establishing rapport; 2) chief
complaint; 3) history; 4) review of systems; 5)
physical examination; 6) diagnoses; 7) procedures;
8) medications; 9) instructions. Except for item 1,
these all correspond to sections of the traditional
clinical note or report and as such have extensive
representations in CDA2 and SNOMED-CT. The
Continuity of Care Document (CCD), a current
effort to harmonize the ASTM and CDA2 stan-
dards in this realm, attempts to focus just on these
elements using CDA2 representation capabilities.
CDA2 is primarily declarative with some capabili-
ties to represent contingencies. This is essentially
what is needed for presenting information, but
much of the encounter requires query and re-
sponse.
The core of Accultran resides in the capability
of the NLP engine to determine the appropriate
context for each physician utterance and to appro-
priately process and route the content of the utter-
ance. The overall communications flow for the
system is illustrated in Figure 1, showing that upon
receiving and processing an utterance from the
physician, the NLP engine can choose one of sev-
eral courses of action:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.993895230769231">
(1) Utterances that contain clinical questions or
clinical statements for the patient to affirm
or deny or instructions are: (a) converted to
CDA2 and are (b) processed by a style sheet
that produces the question/statement (c) first
for physician validation and then (d)
mapped to the patient language with, as
needed, a request to affirm or deny.
(2) Utterances with content that cannot be con-
verted to CDA2 are (a) routed to a general
machine translation system, (b) optionally
with back-translation and physician ap-
proval before (c) presentation to the patient.

gine appropriately directs information to the
EHR via CDA2 for later physician review,
and, as needed, revision.
The Cross-Cultural Advisor (CCA) module is a
key feature. Technically it is based on the NLP
engine&apos;s capability for recognizing and flagging
clinical content that requires special attention be-
yond what the NLP system can independently pro-
vide. In this case, the flags are associated with
warnings related to subject matter that is known to
have either cultural sensitivities for patients in the
target language group or that is difficult to translate
into the target language. Options that the CCA
could present to the physician for any particular
flag would include warnings with explanation of
the sensitivity, pre-formulated queries or informa-
tional presentations that are designed to mitigate
any misunderstandings, or advise that a human
interpreter be involved. In cases where the ser-
vices of a human interpreter are called for, the
CCA identified topic can be used to select, when
available, an interpreter with training or skills ap-
propriate to the case at hand. This can be particu-
larly useful when Video Medical Interpretation
(VMI) capabilities are used and there is a pool of
remote interpreters from which to select.
Triggering of the CCA is not simply a matter of
recognizing key words in the discourse. This
would lead to many spurious invocations of the
CCA. As shown in Figure 1, the CCA is triggered
only from elements of the physician&apos;s discourse.
Although other trigger profiles can be defined, cur-
rent triggers relate to specific patient conditions
and circumstances, and to specific treatment mo-
dalities or some combination of the two. For ex-
ample, a mention that the patient is pregnant would
not in and of itself trigger the CCA. If, however,
the patient is pregnant, is from a culture that at-
taches different significance and family roles and
responsibilities with regard to child bearing, and
the patient is experiencing fear or family pressure,
or if the physician is anticipating the use of a pro-
cedure, say an epidural, that is not familiar in the
patient&apos;s native culture, then the CCA would be
triggered.

2 Demonstration Objectives
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997696166666667">
The initial and primary focus of our work has
been mapping clinical speech to CDA2. The ap-
plication of the system to medical interpretation
grew out of this work due to the availability of
SNOMED-CT (and other clinical nomenclatures,
e.g. the International Classification of Diseases) in
multiple languages. The CCA was a direct out-
growth from the flagging facility that A-Life uses
in its medical coding applications. Direct transla-
tion, i.e. that which is not via the
CDA2/SNOMED-CT mapping, is accomplished
using third-party software. Given this background
and the current state of development, the demon-
stration will focus on the following objectives.
Demonstration of:
Clinical speech to CDA2/SNOMED-CT.
Transforming CDA2/SNOMED-CT to que
form.
Translating CDA2/SNOMED-CT.
Triggering the Cross-Cultural Advisor.
