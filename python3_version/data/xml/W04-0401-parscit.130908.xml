Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999867636363636">
We propose a statistical measure for the degree of
acceptability of light verb constructions, such as
take a walk, based on their linguistic properties. Our
measure shows good correlations with human rat-
ings on unseen test data. Moreover, we find that our
measure correlates more strongly when the poten-
tial complements of the construction (such as walk,
stroll, or run) are separated into semantically similar
classes. Our analysis demonstrates the systematic
nature of the semi-productivity of these construc-
tions.

1 Light Verb Constructions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999632857142857">
Much research on multiword expressions involv-
ing verbs has focused on verb-particle constructions
(VPCs), such as scale up or put down (e.g., Bannard
et al., 2003; McCarthy et al., 2003; Villavicencio,
2003). Another kind of verb-based multiword ex-
pression is light verb constructions (LVCs), such as
the examples in (1).

<bodyText confidence="0.992051142857143">
These constructions, like VPCs, may extend the
meaning of the component words in interesting
ways, may be (semi-)productive, and may or may
not be compositional. Interestingly, despite these
shared properties, LVCs are in some sense the oppo-
site of VPCs. Where VPCs involve a wide range of
verbs in combination with a small number of parti-
cles, LVCs involve a small number of verbs in com-
bination with a wide range of co-verbal elements.
An LVC occurs when a light verb, such as take,
give, or make in (1), is used in conjunction with
a complement to form a multiword expression. A
verb used as a light verb can be viewed as drawing
on a subset of its more general semantic features
(Butt, 2003). This entails that most of the distinc-
tive meaning of a (non-idiomatic) LVC comes from
the complement to the light verb. This property can
be seen clearly in the paraphrases of (1) given below
in (2): in each, the complement of the light verb in
(1a–c) contributes the main verb of the correspond-
ing paraphrase.1

<bodyText confidence="0.999459245614036">
The linguistic importance and crosslinguistic fre-
quency of LVCs is well attested (e.g., Butt, 2003;
Folli et al., 2003). Furthermore, LVCs have partic-
ular properties that require special attention within
a computational system. For example, many LVCs
(such as those in (1) above) exhibit composi-
tional and semi-productive patterns, while others
(such as take charge) may be more fixed. Thus,
LVCs present the well-known problem with multi-
word expressions of determining whether and how
they should be listed in a computational lexicon.
Moreover, LVCs are divided into different classes
of constructions, which have distinctive syntactic
and semantic properties (Wierzbicka, 1982; Kearns,
2002). In general, there is no one “light verb con-
struction” that can be dealt with uniformly in a com-
putational system, as is suggested by Sag et al.
(2002), and generally assumed by earlier compu-
tational work on these constructions (Fontenelle,
1993; Grefenstette and Teufel, 1995; Dras and John-
son, 1996). Rather there are different types of
LVCs, each with unique properties.
In our initial computational investigation of light
verb phenomena, we have chosen to focus on a par-
ticular class of semi-productive LVCs in English,
exemplified by such expressions as take a stroll,
take a run, take a walk, etc. Specifically, we in-
vestigate the degree to which we can determine, on
the basis of corpus statistics, which words form a
valid complement to a given light verb in this type
of construction.
&apos;The two expressions differ in aspectual properties. It has
been argued that the usage of a light verb adds a telic compo-
nent to the event in most cases (Wierzbicka, 1982; Butt, 2003);
though see Folli et al. (2003) for telicity in Persian LVCs.
Our approach draws on a linguistic analysis, pre-
sented in Section 2, in which the complement of
this type of LVC (e.g., a walk in take a walk) is—in
spite of the presence of the determiner a—actually
a verbal element (Wierzbicka, 1982; Kearns, 2002).
Section 3 describes how this analysis motivates both
a method for generalizing over verb classes to find
potential valid complements for a light verb, and a
mutual information measure that takes the linguis-
tic properties of this type of LVC into account. In
Section 4, we outline how we collect the corpus
statistics on which we base our measures intended
to distinguish “good” LVCs from poor ones. Sec-
tion 5 describes the experiments in which we deter-
mine human ratings of potential LVCs, and correlate
those with our mutual information measures. As
predicted, the correlations reveal interesting class-
based behaviour among the LVCs. Section 6 ana-
lyzes the relation of our approach to the earlier com-
putational work on LVCs cited above. Our investi-
gation is preliminary, and Section 7 discusses our
current and future research on LVCs.

2 Linguistic Properties of LVCs
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993789125">
An LVC is a multiword expression that combines
a light verb with a complement of type noun, ad-
jective, preposition or verb, as in, respectively, give
a speech, make good (on), take (NP) into account,
or take a walk. The light verb itself is drawn from
a limited set of semantically general verbs; among
the commonly used light verbs in English are take,
give, make, have, and do. LVCs are highly pro-
ductive in some languages, such as Persian, Urdu,
and Japanese (Karimi, 1997; Butt, 2003; Miyamoto,
2000). In languages such as French, Italian, Spanish
and English, LVCs are semi-productive construc-
tions (Wierzbicka, 1982; Alba-Salas, 2002; Kearns,
2002).
The syntactic and semantic properties of the com-
plement of an LVC determine distinct types of con-
structions. Kearns (2002) distinguishes between
two usages of light verbs in LVCs: what she calls
a true light verb (TLV), as in give a groan, and
what she calls a vague action verb (VAV), as in
give a speech. The main difference between these
two types of light verb usages is that the comple-
ment of a TLV is claimed to be headed by a verb.
Wierzbicka (1982) argues that although the com-
plement in such constructions might appear to be
a zero-derived nominal, its syntactic category when
used in an LVC is actually a verb, as indicated by
the properties of such TLV constructions. For exam-
ple, Kearns (2002) shows that, in contrast to VAVs,
the complement of a TLV usually cannot be definite
(3), nor can it be the surface subject of a passive
construction (4) or a fronted wh-element (5).

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999792527777778">
Because of their interesting and distinctive prop-
erties, we have restricted our initial investigation to
light verb constructions with TLVs, i.e. “LV a V”
constructions, as in give a groan. For simplicity,
we will continue to refer to them here generally as
LVCs. The meaning of an LVC of this type is almost
equivalent to the meaning of the verbal complement
(cf. (1) and (2) in Section 1). However, the light
verb does contribute to the meaning of the construc-
tion, as can be seen by the fact that there are con-
straints on which light verb can occur with which
complement (Wierzbicka, 1982). For example, one
can give a cry but not *take a cry. The acceptability
depends on semantic properties of the complement,
and, as we explore below, may generalize in consis-
tent ways across semantically similar (complement)
verbs, as in give a cry, give a moan, give a howl;
*take a cry, *take a moan, *take a howl.
Many interesting questions pertaining to the syn-
tactic and semantic properties of LVCs have been
examined in the linguistic literature: How does the
semantics of an LVC relate to the semantics of its
parts? How does the type of the complement affect
the meaning of an LVC? Why do certain light verbs
select for certain complements? What underlies the
(semi-)productivity of the creation of LVCs?
Given the crosslinguistic frequency of LVCs,
work on computational lexicons will depend heav-
ily on the answers to these questions. We also be-
lieve that computational investigation can help to
precisely answer the questions as well, by using sta-
tistical corpus-based analysis to explore the range
and properties of these constructions. While details
of the underlying semantic representation of LVCs
are beyond the scope of this paper, we address the
questions of their semi-productivity.

3 Our Proposal
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9985275">
The initial goal in our investigation of semi-
productivity is to find a means for determining how
well particular light verbs and complements go to-
gether. We focus on the “LV a V” constructions be-
cause we are interested in the hypothesis that the
complement to the LV is a verb, and think that the
properties of this construction may place interesting
restrictions on what forms a valid LVC.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999844">
3.1 Generalizing over Verb Classes
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998478772727273">
As noted above, there are constraints in an “LV a
V” construction on which complements can occur
with particular light verbs. Moreover, similar po-
tential complements pattern alike in this regard—
that is, semantically similar complements may have
the same pattern of co-occurrence across different
light verbs. Since the complement is hypothesized
to be a verbal element, we look to verb classes to
capture the relevant semantic similarity. The lexical
semantic classes of Levin (1993) have been used as
a standard verb classification within the computa-
tional linguistics community. We thus propose us-
ing these classes as the semantically similar groups
over which to compare acceptability of potential
complements with a given light verb.2
Our approach is related to the idea of substi-
tutability in multiword expressions. Substituting
pieces of a multiword expression with semantically
similar words from a thesaurus can be used to deter-
mine productivity—higher degree of substitutabil-
ity indicating higher productivity (Lin, 1999; Mc-
Carthy et al., 2003).3 Instead of using a thesaurus-
based measure, Villavicencio (2003) uses substi-
tutability over semantic verb classes to determine
potential verb-particle combinations.
Our method is somewhat different from these ear-
lier approaches, not only in focusing on LVCs, but
in the precise goal. While Villavicencio (2003) uses
verb classes to generalize over verbs and then con-
firms whether an expression is attested, we seek to
determine how good an expression is. Specifically,
we aim to develop a computational approach not
only for characterizing the set of complements that
can occur with a given light verb in these LVCs, but
also to quantify the acceptability.
In investigating light verbs and their combina-
tion with complements from various verb semantic
classes, we expect that these LVCs are not fully id-
iosyncratic, but exhibit systematic behaviour. Most
importantly, we hypothesize that they show class-
based behaviour—i.e., that the same light verb will
show distinct patterns of acceptability with comple-
ments across different verb classes. We also ex-
2We also need to compare generalizability over semantic
noun classes to further test the linguistic hypothesis. We ini-
tially performed such experiments on noun classes in Word-
Net, but, due to the difficulty of deciding an appropriate level
of generalization in the hierarchy, we left this as future work.
3Note that although Lin characterizes his work as detecting
non-compositionality, we agree with Bannard et al. (2003) that
it is better thought of as tapping into productivity.
plore whether the light verbs themselves show dif-
ferent patterns in terms of how they are used semi-
productively in these constructions.
We choose to focus on the light verbs take, give,
and make. We choose take and give because they
seem similar in their ability to occur in a range of
LVCs, and yet they have almost the opposite se-
mantics. We hope that the latter will reveal inter-
esting patterns in occurrence with the different verb
classes. On the other hand, make seems very dif-
ferent from both take and give. It seems much less
restrictive in its combinations, and also seems diffi-
cult to distinguish in terms of light versus “heavy”
uses. We expect it to show different generalization
behaviour from the other two light verbs.

3.2 Devising an Acceptability Measure
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999789347826087">
Given the experimental focus, we must devise a
method for determining acceptability of LVCs. One
possibility is to use a standard measure for detect-
ing collocations, such as pointwise mutual informa-
tion (Church et al., 1991). “LV a V” constructions
are well-suited to collocational analysis, as the light
verb can be seen as the first component of a colloca-
tion, and the string “a V” as the second component.
Applying this idea to potential LVCs, we calculate
pointwise mutual information, I(lv; aV).
In addition, we use the linguistic properties of
the “LV a V” construction to develop a more in-
formed measure. As noted in Section 2, generally
only the indefinite determiner a (or an) is allowed
in this type of LVC. We hypothesize then that for a
“good” LVC, we should find a much higher mutual
information value for “LV a V” than for “LV [det]
V”, where [det] is any determiner other than the in-
definite. While I(lv; aV) should tell us whether “LV
a V” is a good collocation (Church et al., 1991), the
difference between the two, I(lv; aV) - I(lv; detV),
should tell us whether the collocation is an LVC.
To summarize, we assume that:
</bodyText>
<construct confidence="0.770082">
if I(lv; aV) 0 then
“LV a V” is likely not a good collocation;

<bodyText confidence="0.988553571428571">
“LV a V” is likely not a true LVC.
In order to capture these two conditions in a sin-
gle measure, we combine them by using a linear ap-
proximation to the two lines given by I(lv; aV) 0
and I(lv; aV) - I(lv; detV) 0. The most straight-
forward line approximating the combined effect of
these two conditions is:

Even the 100M words of the British National Cor-

acceptable level of LVC coverage: a very common
LVC such as take a stroll, for instance, is attested
only 23 times. To ensure sufficient data to detect
less common LVCs, we instead use the Web as our
corpus (in particular, the subsection indexed by the
Google search engine, http://www.google.com).
Using the Web to overcome data sparseness has
been attempted before (Keller et al., 2002); how-
ever, there are issues: misspellings, typographic er-

nored in Google searches, meaning that search re-
sults can cross phrase or sentence boundaries. For
instance, an exact phrase search for “take a cry”
would return a web page which had the text It was
too much to take. A cry escaped his lips. When
searching for an unattested LVC, these noisy results
can begin to dominate. In ongoing work, we are
devising some automatic clean-up methods to elim-
inate some of the false positives.
On the other hand, it should be pointed out that
not all “good” LVCs will appear in our corpus, de-
spite its size. In this view we differ from Villavi-
cencio (2003), who assumes that if a multiword ex-
pression is not found in the Google index, then it is
not a good construction. As an example, consider
The clown took a cavort across the stage. The LVC
seems plausible; however, Google returns no results
for “took a cavort”. This underlines the need for de-
termining plausible (as opposed to attested) LVCs,
which class-based generalization has the potential
to support.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.991043">
4.3 Extraction
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999976896551724">
To measure mutual information, we gather several
counts for each potential LVC: the frequency of the
LVC (e.g., give a cry), the frequency of the light
verb (e.g., give), and the frequency of the comple-
ment of the LVC (e.g., a cry). To achieve broader
coverage, counts of the light verbs and the LVCs
are collapsed across three tenses: the base form, the
present, and the simple past. Since we are interested
in the differences across determiners, we search for
both the LVC (“give [det] cry”) and the complement
alone (“[det] cry”) using all singular determiners.
Thus, for each LVC, we require a number of LVC
searches, as exemplified in Table 2, and analogous
searches for “[det] V”.
All searches were performed using an exact string
search in Google, during a 24-hour period in March,
2004. The number of results returned is used as the
frequency count. Note that this is an underestimate,
since an LVC may occur than once in a single web
page; however, examining each document to count
the actual occurrences is infeasible, given the num-
ber of possible results. The size of the corpus (also
needed in calculating our measures) is estimated at
5.6 billion, the number of hits returned in a search
for “the”. This is also surely an underestimate, but
is consistent with our other frequency counts.
NSP is used to calculate pointwise mutual in-
formation over the counts (Banerjee and Pedersen,
2003).

5 Experimental Results
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999856">
In these initial experiments, we compare human rat-
ings of the target LVCs to several mutual informa-
tion measures over our corpus counts, using Spear-
man rank correlation. We have two goals: to see
whether these LVCs show differing behaviour ac-
cording to the light verb and/or the verb class of
the complement, and to determine whether we can
indeed predict acceptability from corpus statistics.
We first describe the human ratings, then the corre-
lation results on our development and test data.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.994785">
5.1 Human Ratings
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998475862069">
We use pilot results in which two native speakers
of English rated each combination of “LV a V” in
terms of acceptability. For the development classes,
we used integer ratings of 1 (unacceptable) to 5
(completely natural), allowing for “in-between” rat-
ings as well, such as 2.5. For the test classes, we set
the top rating at 4, since we found that ratings up to
5 covered a larger range than seemed natural. The
test ratings yielded linearly weighted Kappa values
of .72, .39, and .44, for take, give, and make, respec-
tively, and .53 overall.5
To determine a consensus rating, the human raters
first discussed disagreements of more than one rat-
ing point. In the test data, this led to 6% of the rat-
ings being changed. (Note that this is 6% of ratings,
not 6% of verbs; fewer verbs were changed, since
for some verbs both raters changed their rating after
discussion.) We then simply averaged each pair of
ratings to yield a single consensus rating for each
item.
In order to see differences in human ratings
across the light verbs and the semantic classes of
their complements, we put the (consensus) human
ratings in bins of low (ratings 2) , medium (rat-
ings 2, 3), and high (ratings 3). (Even a
score of 2 meant that an LVC was “ok”.) Table 3
shows the distribution of medium and high scores
for each of the light verbs and test classes. We can
see that some classes generally allow more LVCs

5Agreement on the development set was much lower (lin-
early weighted Kappa values of .37, .23, and .56, for take, give,
and make, respectively, and .38 overall), due to differences in
interpretation of the ratings. Discussion of these issues by the
raters led to more consistency in test data ratings.

43.2). Furthermore, the light verbs show very differ-
ent patterns of acceptability for different classes—
e.g., give is fairly good with 43.2, while take is very
bad, and the pattern is reversed for 51.4.2. In gen-
eral, give allows more LVCs on the test classes than
do the other two light verbs.

5.2 Correlations with Statistical Measures
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998825">
Our next step is to see whether the ratings, and the
patterns across light verbs and classes, are reflected
in the statistical measures over corpus data. Because
our human ratings are not normally distributed (gen-
erally having a high proportion of values less than
2), we use the Spearman rank correlation coefficient
to compare the consensus ratings to the mutual in-
formation measures.6
As described in Section 3.2, we use pointwise
mutual information over the “LV a V” string, as well
as measures we developed that incorporate the lin-
guistic observation that these LVCs typically do not
occur with definite determiners. On our develop-
ment set, we tested several of these measures and
found that the following had the best correlations
with human ratings:

<equation confidence="0.718575">
MI: I(lv; aV)
DiffAll: 2 I(lv; aV) - I(lv; detV)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9946670625">
where I(lv; detV) is the mutual information over
strings “LV [det] V”, and det is any determiner other
than a, an, or the. Note that DiffAll is the most
general of our combined measures; however, some
verbs are not detected with other determiners, and
thus DiffAll may apply to a smaller number of items
than MI.
We focus on the analysis of these two measures
on test data, but the general patterns are the same
6Experiments on the development set to determine a thresh-
old on the different measures to classify LVCs as good or not
showed promise in their coarse match with human judgments.
However, we set this work aside for now, since the correlation
coefficients are more informative regarding the fine-grained
match of the measures to human ratings, which cover a fairly
wide range of acceptability.

on the development set. Table 4 shows the correla-
tion results on our unseen test LVCs. We get rea-
sonably good correlations with the human ratings
across a number of the light verbs and classes, indi-
cating that these measures may be helpful in deter-
mining which light verb plus complement combina-
tions form valid LVCs. In what follows, we examine
more detailed patterns, to better analyze the data.
First, comparing the test correlations to Table 3,
we find that the classes with a low number of “good”
LVCs have poor correlations. When we examine the
correlation graphs, we see that, in general, there is
a good correlation between the ratings greater than
1 and the corresponding measure, but when the rat-
ing is 1, there is often a wide range of values for the
corpus-based measure. One cause could be noise
in the data, as mentioned earlier—that is, for bad
LVCs, we are picking up too many “false hits”, due
to the limitations of using Google searches on the
web. To confirm this, we examine one develop-
ment class (10.4.1, the Wipe manner verbs), which
was expected to be bad with take. We find a large
number of hits for “take a V” that are not good
LVCs, such as “take a strip [of tape/of paper]”, “take
a pluck[-and-play approach]”. On the other hand,
some examples with unexpectedly high corpus mea-
sures are LVCs the human raters were simply not
aware of (“take a skim through the manual”), which
underscores the difficulty of human rating of a semi-
productive construction.
Second, we note that we get very good cor-
relations with take, somewhat less good correla-
tions with give, and generally poor correlations with
make. We had predicted that take and give would
behave similarly (and the difference between take
and give is less pronounced in the development
data). We think one reason give has poorer correla-
tions is that it was harder to rate (it had the highest
proportion of disagreements), and so the human rat-
ings may not be as consistent as for take. Also, for a
class like 30.3, which we expected to be good with
give (e.g., give a look, give a glance), we found that
the LVCs were mostly good only in the dative form
(e.g., give her a look, give it a glance). Since we
only looked for exact matches to “LV a V”, we did
not detect this kind of construction.
We had predicted that make would behave dif-
ferently from take and give, and indeed, except in
one case, the correlations for make are poorer on
the individual classes. Interestingly, the correlation
overall attains a much better value using the mutual
information of “LV a V” alone (i.e., the MI mea-
sure). We think that the pattern of correlations with
make may be because it is not necessarily a “true
light verb” construction in many cases, but rather a
“vague action verb” (see Section 2). If so, its be-
haviour across the complements may be somewhat
more arbitrary, combining different uses.
Finally, we compare the combined measure Diff-
All to the mutual information, MI, alone. We hy-
pothesized that while the latter should indicate a
collocation, the combined measure should help to
focus on LVCs in particular, because of their lin-
guistic property of occurring primarily with an in-
definite determiner. On the individual classes, when
considering correlations that are statistically signif-
icant or marginally so (i.e., at the confidence level
of 90%), the DiffAll measure overall has somewhat
stronger correlations than MI. Over all complement
verbs together, DiffAll is roughly the same as MI
for take; is somewhat better for give, and is worse
for make.&apos;
Better performance over the individual classes in-
dicates that when applying the measures, at least to
take and give, it is helpful to separate the data ac-
cording to semantic verb class. For make, the ap-
propriate approach is not as clear, since the results
on the individual classes are so skewed. In gen-
eral, the results confirm our hypothesis that seman-
tic verb classes are highly relevant to measuring the
acceptability of LVCs of this type. The results also
indicate the need to look in more detail at the prop-
erties of different light verbs.

Other computational research on LVCs differs from
ours in two key aspects. First, the work has looked
at any nominalizations as complements of poten-
tial light verbs (what they term “support verbs”)
(Fontenelle, 1993; Grefenstette and Teufel, 1995;
Dras and Johnson, 1996). Our work differs in fo-
cusing on verbal nouns that form the complement
of a particular type of LVC, allowing us to explore
the role of class information in restricting the com-
plements of these constructions. Second, this earlier
work has viewed all verbs as possible light verbs,
while we look at only the class of potential light
verbs identified by linguistic theory.
The difference in focus on these two aspects of
the problem leads to the basic differences in ap-
proach: while they attempt to find probable light
verbs for nominalization complements, we try to
find possible (verbal) noun complements for given
light verbs. Our work differs both practically, in the
type of measure used, and conceptually, in the for-
mulation of the problem. For example, Grefenstette
and Teufel (1995) used some linguistic properties to
weed out potential light verbs from lists sorted by
raw frequency, while Dras and Johnson (1996) used
frequency of the verb weighted by a weak predictor
of its prior probability as a light verb. We instead
use a standard collocation detection measure (mu-
tual information), the terms of which we modify to

More fundamentally, our proposal differs in its
emphasis on possible class-based generalizations
in LVCs that have heretofore been unexplored. It
would be interesting to apply this idea to the broader
classes of nominalizations investigated in earlier
work. Moreover, our approach could draw on ideas
from the earlier proposals to detect the light verbs
automatically, since the precise set of LVs differs
crosslinguistically—and LV status may indeed be a
continuum rather than a discrete distinction.

Our results demonstrate the benefit of treating LVCs
as more than just a simple collocation. We exploit
linguistic knowledge particular to the “LV a V” con-
struction to devise an acceptability measure that cor-
relates reasonably well with human judgments. By
comparing the mutual information with indefinite
and definite determiners, we use syntactic patterns
to tap into the distinctive underlying properties of
the construction.
Furthermore, we hypothesized that, because the
complement in these constructions is a verb, we
would see systematic behaviour across the light
verbs in terms of their ability to combine with com-
plements from different verb classes. Our human
ratings indeed showed class-based tendencies for
the light verbs. Moreover, our acceptability measure
showed higher correlations when the verbs were di-
vided by class. This indicates that there is greater
consistency within a verb class between the cor-
pus statistics and the ability to combine with a light
verb. Thus, the semantic classes provide a useful
way to increase the performance of the acceptabil-
ity measure.
The correlations are far from perfect, however. In
addition to noise in the data, one problem may be
that these classes are too coarse-grained. Explo-
ration is needed of other possible verb (and noun)
classes as the basis for generalizing the comple-
ments of these constructions. However, we must
also look to the measures themselves for improv-
ing our techniques. Several linguistic properties dis-
tinguish these constructions, but our measures only
drew on one. In ongoing work, we are explor-
ing methods for incorporating other linguistic be-
haviours into a measure for these constructions, as
well as for LVCs more generally.
We are widening this investigation in other direc-
tions as well. Our results reveal interesting differ-
ences among the light verbs, indicating that the set
of light verbs is itself heterogeneous. More research
is needed to determine the properties of a broader
range of light verbs, and how they influence the
valid combinations they form with semantic classes.
Finally, we plan to collect more extensive rating
data, but are concerned with the difficulty found in
judging these constructions. Gathering solid human
ratings is a challenge in this line of investigation, but
this only serves to underscore the importance of de-
vising corpus-based acceptability measures in order
to better support development of accurate computa-
tional lexicons.

Our measure shows good correlations with human ratings on unseen test data. Moreover, we find that our measure correlates more strongly when the potencomplements of the construction (such as or are separated into semantically similar classes. Our analysis demonstrates the systematic nature of the semi-productivity of these constructions. 1 Light Verb Constructions Much research on multiword expressions involving verbs has focused on verb-particle constructions such as up down Bannard et al., 2003; McCarthy et al., 2003; Villavicencio, 2003). Another kind of verb-based multiword expression is light verb constructions (LVCs), such as the examples in (1). a. Sara a stroll the beach. Paul a knock the door. Jamie a pass her teammate. These constructions, like VPCs, may extend the meaning of the component words in interesting ways, may be (semi-)productive, and may or may not be compositional. Interestingly, despite these shared properties, LVCs are in some sense the opposite of VPCs. Where VPCs involve a wide range of verbs in combination with a small number of particles, LVCs involve a small number of verbs in combination with a wide range of co-verbal elements. LVC occurs when a such as or (1), is used in conjunction with a complement to form a multiword expression. A verb used as a light verb can be viewed as drawing on a subset of its more general semantic features (Butt, 2003). This entails that most of the distinctive meaning of a (non-idiomatic) LVC comes from the complement to the light verb. This property can be seen clearly in the paraphrases of (1) given below in (2): in each, the complement of the light verb in (1a–c) contributes the main verb of the corresponda. Sara the beach. Paul the door. Jamie her teammate. The linguistic importance and crosslinguistic frequency of LVCs is well attested (e.g., Butt, 2003; Folli et al., 2003). Furthermore, LVCs have particular properties that require special attention within a computational system. For example, many LVCs (such as those in (1) above) exhibit compositional and semi-productive patterns, while others as may be more fixed. Thus, LVCs present the well-known problem with multiword expressions of determining whether and how they should be listed in a computational lexicon. Moreover, LVCs are divided into different classes of constructions, which have distinctive syntactic and semantic properties (Wierzbicka, 1982; Kearns, 2002). In general, there is no one “light verb construction” that can be dealt with uniformly in a computational system, as is suggested by Sag et al. (2002), and generally assumed by earlier computational work on these constructions (Fontenelle, 1993; Grefenstette and Teufel, 1995; Dras and Johnson, 1996). Rather there are different types of LVCs, each with unique properties. In our initial computational investigation of light verb phenomena, we have chosen to focus on a particular class of semi-productive LVCs in English, by such expressions as a a a etc. Specifically, we investigate the degree to which we can determine, on the basis of corpus statistics, which words form a valid complement to a given light verb in this type of construction. two expressions differ in aspectual properties. It has been argued that the usage of a light verb adds a telic component to the event in most cases (Wierzbicka, 1982; Butt, 2003); though see Folli et al. (2003) for telicity in Persian LVCs. Our approach draws on a linguistic analysis, presented in Section 2, in which the complement of type of LVC (e.g., walk a is—in of the presence of the determiner a verbal element (Wierzbicka, 1982; Kearns, 2002). Section 3 describes how this analysis motivates both a method for generalizing over verb classes to find potential valid complements for a light verb, and a mutual information measure that takes the linguistic properties of this type of LVC into account. In Section 4, we outline how we collect the corpus statistics on which we base our measures intended to distinguish “good” LVCs from poor ones. Section 5 describes the experiments in which we determine human ratings of potential LVCs, and correlate those with our mutual information measures. As predicted, the correlations reveal interesting classbased behaviour among the LVCs. Section 6 analyzes the relation of our approach to the earlier computational work on LVCs cited above. Our investigation is preliminary, and Section 7 discusses our current and future research on LVCs. 2 Linguistic Properties of LVCs An LVC is a multiword expression that combines a light verb with a complement of type noun, adpreposition or verb, as in, respectively, good (NP) into a The light verb itself is drawn from a limited set of semantically general verbs; among commonly used light verbs in English are and LVCs are highly productive in some languages, such as Persian, Urdu, and Japanese (Karimi, 1997; Butt, 2003; Miyamoto, 2000). In languages such as French, Italian, Spanish and English, LVCs are semi-productive constructions (Wierzbicka, 1982; Alba-Salas, 2002; Kearns, 2002). The syntactic and semantic properties of the complement of an LVC determine distinct types of constructions. Kearns (2002) distinguishes between two usages of light verbs in LVCs: what she calls true light verb (TLV), as in a and what she calls a vague action verb (VAV), as in a The main difference between these two types of light verb usages is that the complement of a TLV is claimed to be headed by a verb. Wierzbicka (1982) argues that although the complement in such constructions might appear to be a zero-derived nominal, its syntactic category when used in an LVC is actually a verb, as indicated by the properties of such TLV constructions. For example, Kearns (2002) shows that, in contrast to VAVs, the complement of a TLV usually cannot be definite (3), nor can it be the surface subject of a passive (4) or a fronted (5). (3) a. Jan gave the speech just now. b. * Jan gave the groan just now. (4) a. A speech was given by Jan. b. * A groan was given by Jan. (5) a. Which speech did Jan give? b. * Which groan did Jan give? Because of their interesting and distinctive properties, we have restricted our initial investigation to light verb constructions with TLVs, i.e. “LV a V” as in a For simplicity, we will continue to refer to them here generally as LVCs. The meaning of an LVC of this type is almost equivalent to the meaning of the verbal complement (cf. (1) and (2) in Section 1). However, the light verb does contribute to the meaning of the construction, as can be seen by the fact that there are constraints on which light verb can occur with which complement (Wierzbicka, 1982). For example, one a cry not a The acceptability depends on semantic properties of the complement, and, as we explore below, may generalize in consistent ways across semantically similar (complement) as in a a a a a a Many interesting questions pertaining to the syntactic and semantic properties of LVCs have been examined in the linguistic literature: How does the semantics of an LVC relate to the semantics of its parts? How does the type of the complement affect the meaning of an LVC? Why do certain light verbs select for certain complements? What underlies the (semi-)productivity of the creation of LVCs? Given the crosslinguistic frequency of LVCs, work on computational lexicons will depend heavily on the answers to these questions. We also believe that computational investigation can help to precisely answer the questions as well, by using statistical corpus-based analysis to explore the range and properties of these constructions. While details of the underlying semantic representation of LVCs are beyond the scope of this paper, we address the questions of their semi-productivity. 3 Our Proposal The initial goal in our investigation of semiproductivity is to find a means for determining how well particular light verbs and complements go together. We focus on the “LV a V” constructions because we are interested in the hypothesis that the complement to the LV is a verb, and think that the properties of this construction may place interesting restrictions on what forms a valid LVC. 3.1 Generalizing over Verb Classes As noted above, there are constraints in an “LV a V” construction on which complements can occur with particular light verbs. Moreover, similar potential complements pattern alike in this regard— that is, semantically similar complements may have the same pattern of co-occurrence across different light verbs. Since the complement is hypothesized to be a verbal element, we look to verb classes to capture the relevant semantic similarity. The lexical semantic classes of Levin (1993) have been used as a standard verb classification within the computational linguistics community. We thus propose using these classes as the semantically similar groups over which to compare acceptability of potential with a given light Our approach is related to the idea of substitutability in multiword expressions. Substituting pieces of a multiword expression with semantically similar words from a thesaurus can be used to determine productivity—higher degree of substitutability indicating higher productivity (Lin, 1999; Mcet al., Instead of using a thesaurusbased measure, Villavicencio (2003) uses substitutability over semantic verb classes to determine potential verb-particle combinations. Our method is somewhat different from these earlier approaches, not only in focusing on LVCs, but in the precise goal. While Villavicencio (2003) uses verb classes to generalize over verbs and then confirms whether an expression is attested, we seek to determine how good an expression is. Specifically, we aim to develop a computational approach not only for characterizing the set of complements that can occur with a given light verb in these LVCs, but also to quantify the acceptability. In investigating light verbs and their combination with complements from various verb semantic classes, we expect that these LVCs are not fully idiosyncratic, but exhibit systematic behaviour. Most importantly, we hypothesize that they show classbased behaviour—i.e., that the same light verb will show distinct patterns of acceptability with compleacross different verb classes. We also exalso need to compare generalizability over semantic noun classes to further test the linguistic hypothesis. We initially performed such experiments on noun classes in Word- Net, but, due to the difficulty of deciding an appropriate level of generalization in the hierarchy, we left this as future work. that although Lin characterizes his work as detecting non-compositionality, we agree with Bannard et al. (2003) that it is better thought of as tapping into productivity. plore whether the light verbs themselves show different patterns in terms of how they are used semiproductively in these constructions. choose to focus on the light verbs We choose they seem similar in their ability to occur in a range of LVCs, and yet they have almost the opposite semantics. We hope that the latter will reveal interesting patterns in occurrence with the different verb On the other hand, very diffrom both It seems much less restrictive in its combinations, and also seems difficult to distinguish in terms of light versus “heavy” uses. We expect it to show different generalization behaviour from the other two light verbs. 3.2 Devising an Acceptability Measure Given the experimental focus, we must devise a method for determining acceptability of LVCs. One possibility is to use a standard measure for detecting collocations, such as pointwise mutual information (Church et al., 1991). “LV a V” constructions are well-suited to collocational analysis, as the light verb can be seen as the first component of a collocation, and the string “a V” as the second component. Applying this idea to potential LVCs, we calculate pointwise mutual information, I(lv; aV). In addition, we use the linguistic properties of the “LV a V” construction to develop a more informed measure. As noted in Section 2, generally the indefinite determiner is allowed in this type of LVC. We hypothesize then that for a “good” LVC, we should find a much higher mutual information value for “LV a V” than for “LV [det] V”, where [det] is any determiner other than the indefinite. While I(lv; aV) should tell us whether “LV V” is a good et al., 1991), the difference between the two, I(lv; aV) - I(lv; detV), should tell us whether the collocation is an LVC. To summarize, we assume that: if I(lv; aV) 0 then “LV a V” is likely not a good collocation; if I(lv; aV) - I(lv; detV) 0 then “LV a V” is likely not a true LVC. In order to capture these two conditions in a single measure, we combine them by using a linear approximation to the two lines given by I(lv; aV) 0 and I(lv; aV) - I(lv; detV) 0. The most straightforward line approximating the combined effect of these two conditions is: 2 I(lv; aV) - I(lv; detV) 0 We hypothesize that this combined measure— 2 I(lv; aV) - I(lv; detV)—will correlate bet-</abstract>

To ensure sufficient data to detect less common LVCs, we instead use the Web as our corpus (in particular, the subsection indexed by the Google search engine, http://www.google.com).

Possessive Search Strings give/gives/gave a cry give/gives/gave the cry give/gives/gave this/that cry give/gives/gave my/.../their cry 2: Searches for light verb verb nored in Google searches, meaning that search results can cross phrase or sentence boundaries. For instance, an exact phrase search for “take a cry” return a web page which had the text was much to take. A cry escaped his lips. searching for an unattested LVC, these noisy results can begin to dominate. In ongoing work, we are devising some automatic clean-up methods to eliminate some of the false positives. On the other hand, it should be pointed out that not all “good” LVCs will appear in our corpus, despite its size. In this view we differ from Villavicencio (2003), who assumes that if a multiword expression is not found in the Google index, then it is not a good construction. As an example, consider clown took a cavort across the The LVC seems plausible; however, Google returns no results for “took a cavort”. This underlines the need for determining plausible (as opposed to attested) LVCs, which class-based generalization has the potential to support. 4.3 Extraction To measure mutual information, we gather several counts for each potential LVC: the frequency of the (e.g., a the frequency of the light (e.g., and the frequency of the compleof the LVC (e.g., To achieve broader coverage, counts of the light verbs and the LVCs are collapsed across three tenses: the base form, the present, and the simple past. Since we are interested in the differences across determiners, we search for both the LVC (“give [det] cry”) and the complement alone (“[det] cry”) using all singular determiners. Thus, for each LVC, we require a number of LVC searches, as exemplified in Table 2, and analogous searches for “[det] V”. All searches were performed using an exact string search in Google, during a 24-hour period in March, 2004. The number of results returned is used as the frequency count. Note that this is an underestimate, since an LVC may occur than once in a single web page; however, examining each document to count the actual occurrences is infeasible, given the number of possible results. The size of the corpus (also needed in calculating our measures) is estimated at 5.6 billion, the number of hits returned in a search for “the”. This is also surely an underestimate, but is consistent with our other frequency counts. NSP is used to calculate pointwise mutual information over the counts (Banerjee and Pedersen, 2003). 5 Experimental Results In these initial experiments, we compare human ratings of the target LVCs to several mutual information measures over our corpus counts, using Spearman rank correlation. We have two goals: to see whether these LVCs show differing behaviour according to the light verb and/or the verb class of the complement, and to determine whether we can indeed predict acceptability from corpus statistics. We first describe the human ratings, then the correlation results on our development and test data. 5.1 Human Ratings We use pilot results in which two native speakers of English rated each combination of “LV a V” in terms of acceptability. For the development classes, we used integer ratings of 1 (unacceptable) to 5 (completely natural), allowing for “in-between” ratings as well, such as 2.5. For the test classes, we set the top rating at 4, since we found that ratings up to 5 covered a larger range than seemed natural. The test ratings yielded linearly weighted Kappa values .72, .39, and .44, for and respecand .53 To determine a consensus rating, the human raters first discussed disagreements of more than one rating point. In the test data, this led to 6% of the ratings being changed. (Note that this is 6% of ratings, not 6% of verbs; fewer verbs were changed, since for some verbs both raters changed their rating after discussion.) We then simply averaged each pair of ratings to yield a single consensus rating for each item. In order to see differences in human ratings across the light verbs and the semantic classes of their complements, we put the (consensus) human in bins of low (ratings 2) , medium (ratings 2, 3), and high (ratings 3). (Even score of 2 meant that an LVC was “ok”.) Table 3 shows the distribution of medium and high scores for each of the light verbs and test classes. We can see that some classes generally allow more LVCs on the development set was much lower (linweighted Kappa values of .37, .23, and .56, for respectively, and .38 overall), due to differences in interpretation of the ratings. Discussion of these issues by the raters led to more consistency in test data ratings. Class # N take give make 18.1,2 35 8 (23%) 15 (43%) 8 (23%) 30.3 18 5 (28%) 5 (28%) 3 (17%) 43.2 35 1 (3%) 11 (31%) 9 (26%) 51.4.2 10 7 (70%) 2 (20%) 1 (10%) Table 3: Number of medium and high scores for each LV and class. N is the number of test verbs. across the light verbs (e.g., 18.1,2) than others (e.g, 43.2). Furthermore, the light verbs show very different patterns of acceptability for different classes— fairly good with 43.2, while very bad, and the pattern is reversed for 51.4.2. In genmore LVCs on the test classes than do the other two light verbs. 5.2 Correlations with Statistical Measures Our next step is to see whether the ratings, and the patterns across light verbs and classes, are reflected in the statistical measures over corpus data. Because our human ratings are not normally distributed (generally having a high proportion of values less than 2), we use the Spearman rank correlation coefficient to compare the consensus ratings to the mutual in- As described in Section 3.2, we use pointwise mutual information over the “LV a V” string, as well as measures we developed that incorporate the linguistic observation that these LVCs typically do not occur with definite determiners. On our development set, we tested several of these measures and found that the following had the best correlations with human ratings: aV) I(lv; aV) - I(lv; detV) where I(lv; detV) is the mutual information over strings “LV [det] V”, and det is any determiner other or Note that the most general of our combined measures; however, some verbs are not detected with other determiners, and apply to a smaller number of items We focus on the analysis of these two measures on test data, but the general patterns are the same on the development set to determine a threshold on the different measures to classify LVCs as good or not showed promise in their coarse match with human judgments. However, we set this work aside for now, since the correlation coefficients are more informative regarding the fine-grained match of the measures to human ratings, which cover a fairly wide range of acceptability.

Table 4 shows the correlation results on our unseen test LVCs. We get reasonably good correlations with the human ratings across a number of the light verbs and classes, indicating that these measures may be helpful in determining which light verb plus complement combinations form valid LVCs. In what follows, we examine more detailed patterns, to better analyze the data. First, comparing the test correlations to Table 3, we find that the classes with a low number of “good” LVCs have poor correlations. When we examine the correlation graphs, we see that, in general, there is a good correlation between the ratings greater than 1 and the corresponding measure, but when the rating is 1, there is often a wide range of values for the corpus-based measure. One cause could be noise in the data, as mentioned earlier—that is, for bad LVCs, we are picking up too many “false hits”, due to the limitations of using Google searches on the web. To confirm this, we examine one developclass (10.4.1, the verbs), which expected to be bad with We find a large number of hits for “take a V” that are not good LVCs, such as “take a strip [of tape/of paper]”, “take a pluck[-and-play approach]”. On the other hand, some examples with unexpectedly high corpus measures are LVCs the human raters were simply not aware of (“take a skim through the manual”), which underscores the difficulty of human rating of a semiproductive construction. Second, we note that we get very good corwith somewhat less good correlawith and generally poor correlations with We had predicted that similarly (and the difference between less pronounced in the development We think one reason poorer correlations is that it was harder to rate (it had the highest proportion of disagreements), and so the human ratmay not be as consistent as for Also, for a class like 30.3, which we expected to be good with a a we found that the LVCs were mostly good only in the dative form her a it a Since we only looked for exact matches to “LV a V”, we did not detect this kind of construction. had predicted that behave diffrom and indeed, except in case, the correlations for poorer on the individual classes. Interestingly, the correlation overall attains a much better value using the mutual of “LV a V” alone (i.e., the measure). We think that the pattern of correlations with be because it is not necessarily a “true light verb” construction in many cases, but rather a “vague action verb” (see Section 2). If so, its behaviour across the complements may be somewhat more arbitrary, combining different uses. we compare the combined measure Diffthe mutual information, alone. We hypothesized that while the latter should indicate a collocation, the combined measure should help to focus on LVCs in particular, because of their linproperty of occurring primarily with an indefinite determiner. On the individual classes, when considering correlations that are statistically significant or marginally so (i.e., at the confidence level 90%), the overall has somewhat correlations than Over all complement together, roughly the same as is somewhat better for and is worse Better performance over the individual classes indicates that when applying the measures, at least to it is helpful to separate the data acto semantic verb class. For the appropriate approach is not as clear, since the results on the individual classes are so skewed. In general, the results confirm our hypothesis that semantic verb classes are highly relevant to measuring the acceptability of LVCs of this type. The results also indicate the need to look in more detail at the properties of different light verbs. 6 Related Work Other computational research on LVCs differs from ours in two key aspects. First, the work has looked as complements of potential light verbs (what they term “support verbs”) (Fontenelle, 1993; Grefenstette and Teufel, 1995; Dras and Johnson, 1996). Our work differs in focusing on verbal nouns that form the complement of a particular type of LVC, allowing us to explore the role of class information in restricting the complements of these constructions. Second, this earlier has viewed as possible light verbs, while we look at only the class of potential light verbs identified by linguistic theory. The difference in focus on these two aspects of the problem leads to the basic differences in approach: while they attempt to find probable light verbs for nominalization complements, we try to find possible (verbal) noun complements for given light verbs. Our work differs both practically, in the type of measure used, and conceptually, in the formulation of the problem. For example, Grefenstette and Teufel (1995) used some linguistic properties to weed out potential light verbs from lists sorted by raw frequency, while Dras and Johnson (1996) used frequency of the verb weighted by a weak predictor of its prior probability as a light verb. We instead use a standard collocation detection measure (mutual information), the terms of which we modify to development data is similar to the test data in favourthe individual classes. Over all deverbs together, somewhat better than is roughly the same for and is somewhat worse capture linguistic properties of the construction. More fundamentally, our proposal differs in its emphasis on possible class-based generalizations in LVCs that have heretofore been unexplored. It would be interesting to apply this idea to the broader classes of nominalizations investigated in earlier work. Moreover, our approach could draw on ideas from the earlier proposals to detect the light verbs automatically, since the precise set of LVs differs crosslinguistically—and LV status may indeed be a continuum rather than a discrete distinction. 7 Conclusions and Future Work Our results demonstrate the benefit of treating LVCs as more than just a simple collocation. We exploit linguistic knowledge particular to the “LV a V” construction to devise an acceptability measure that correlates reasonably well with human judgments. By comparing the mutual information with indefinite and definite determiners, we use syntactic patterns to tap into the distinctive underlying properties of the construction. Furthermore, we hypothesized that, because the complement in these constructions is a verb, we would see systematic behaviour across the light verbs in terms of their ability to combine with complements from different verb classes. Our human ratings indeed showed class-based tendencies for the light verbs. Moreover, our acceptability measure showed higher correlations when the verbs were divided by class. This indicates that there is greater consistency within a verb class between the corpus statistics and the ability to combine with a light verb. Thus, the semantic classes provide a useful way to increase the performance of the acceptability measure. The correlations are far from perfect, however. In addition to noise in the data, one problem may be that these classes are too coarse-grained. Exploration is needed of other possible verb (and noun) classes as the basis for generalizing the complements of these constructions. However, we must also look to the measures themselves for improving our techniques. Several linguistic properties distinguish these constructions, but our measures only drew on one. In ongoing work, we are exploring methods for incorporating other linguistic behaviours into a measure for these constructions, as well as for LVCs more generally. We are widening this investigation in other directions as well. Our results reveal interesting differences among the light verbs, indicating that the set of light verbs is itself heterogeneous. More research is needed to determine the properties of a broader range of light verbs, and how they influence the valid combinations they form with semantic classes. Finally, we plan to collect more extensive rating data, but are concerned with the difficulty found in judging these constructions. Gathering solid human ratings is a challenge in this line of investigation, but this only serves to underscore the importance of devising corpus-based acceptability measures in order to better support development of accurate computational lexicons.

The light verb itself is drawn from a limited set of semantically general verbs; among the commonly used light verbs in English are take, give, make, have, and do. LVCs are highly productive in some languages, such as Persian, Urdu, and Japanese (Karimi, 1997; Butt, 2003; Miyamoto, 2000). In languages such as French, Italian, Spanish and English, LVCs are semi-productive constructions (Wierzbicka, 1982; Alba-Salas, 2002; Kearns, 2002). The syntactic and semantic properties of the complement of an LVC determine distinct types of constructions. Kearns (2002) distinguishes between two usages of light verbs in LVCs: what she calls a true light verb (TLV), as in give a groan, and what she calls a vague action verb (VAV), as in give a speech. The main difference between these two types of light verb usages is that the complement of a TLV is claimed to be headed by a verb. Wierzbicka (1982) argues that although the complement in such constructions might appear to be a zero-derived nominal, its syntactic category wh</context>

Our measure shows good correlations with human ratings on unseen test data. Moreover, we find that our measure correlates more strongly when the potential complements of the construction (such as walk, stroll, or run) are separated into semantically similar classes. Our analysis demonstrates the systematic nature of the semi-productivity of these constructions. 1 Light Verb Constructions Much research on multiword expressions involving verbs has focused on verb-particle constructions (VPCs), such as scale up or put down (e.g., Bannard et al., 2003; McCarthy et al., 2003; Villavicencio, 2003). Another kind of verb-based multiword expression is light verb constructions (LVCs), such as the examples in (1). (1) a. Sara took a stroll along the beach. b. Paul gave a knock on the door. c.

Interestingly, despite these shared properties, LVCs are in some sense the opposite of VPCs. Where VPCs involve a wide range of verbs in combination with a small number of particles, LVCs involve a small number of verbs in combination with a wide range of co-verbal elements. An LVC occurs when a light verb, such as take, give, or make in (1), is used in conjunction with a complement to form a multiword expression. A verb used as a light verb can be viewed as drawing on a subset of its more general semantic features (Butt, 2003). This entails that most of the distinctive meaning of a (non-idiomatic) LVC comes from the complement to the light verb. This property can be seen clearly in the paraphrases of (1) given below in (2): in each, the complement of the light verb in (1a–c) contributes the main verb of the corresponding paraphrase.1 (2) a. Sara strolled along the beach. b. Paul knocked on the door. c. Jamie passed to her teammate. The linguistic importance and crosslinguistic frequency of LVCs is well attested (e.g., Butt, 2003; Folli et al., 2003). Furthermore, LVCs have particular properties that require special</context>

In our initial computational investigation of light verb phenomena, we have chosen to focus on a particular class of semi-productive LVCs in English, exemplified by such expressions as take a stroll, take a run, take a walk, etc. Specifically, we investigate the degree to which we can determine, on the basis of corpus statistics, which words form a valid complement to a given light verb in this type of construction. &apos;The two expressions differ in aspectual properties. It has been argued that the usage of a light verb adds a telic component to the event in most cases (Wierzbicka, 1982; Butt, 2003); though see Folli et al. (2003) for telicity in Persian LVCs. Our approach draws on a linguistic analysis, presented in Section 2, in which the complement of this type of LVC (e.g., a walk in take a walk) is—in spite of the presence of the determiner a—actually a verbal element (Wierzbicka, 1982; Kearns, 2002).

The light verb itself is drawn from a limited set of semantically general verbs; among the commonly used light verbs in English are take, give, make, have, and do. LVCs are highly productive in some languages, such as Persian, Urdu, and Japanese (Karimi, 1997; Butt, 2003; Miyamoto, 2000). In languages such as French, Italian, Spanish and English, LVCs are semi-productive constructions (Wierzbicka, 1982; Alba-Salas, 2002; Kearns, 2002). The syntactic and semantic properties of the complement of an LVC determine distinct types of constructions. Kearns (2002) distinguishes between two usages of light verbs in LVCs: what she calls a true light verb (TLV), as in give a groan, and what she calls a vague action verb (VAV), as in give a speech. The main difference between these two types of light verb usages is that the complement of a TLV is claimed to be headed by </context>

On the other hand, make seems very different from both take and give. It seems much less restrictive in its combinations, and also seems difficult to distinguish in terms of light versus “heavy” uses. We expect it to show different generalization behaviour from the other two light verbs. 3.2 Devising an Acceptability Measure Given the experimental focus, we must devise a method for determining acceptability of LVCs. One possibility is to use a standard measure for detecting collocations, such as pointwise mutual information (Church et al., 1991). “LV a V” constructions are well-suited to collocational analysis, as the light verb can be seen as the first component of a collocation, and the string “a V” as the second component. Applying this idea to potential LVCs, we calculate pointwise mutual information, I(lv; aV). In addition, we use the linguistic properties of the “LV a V” construction to develop a more informed measure. As noted in Section 2, generally only the indefinite determiner a (or an) is allowed in this type of LVC. We hypothesize then that for a “good” LVC, we should find a much higher mutual information value for “LV a</context>

Moreover, similar potential complements pattern alike in this regard— that is, semantically similar complements may have the same pattern of co-occurrence across different light verbs. Since the complement is hypothesized to be a verbal element, we look to verb classes to capture the relevant semantic similarity. The lexical semantic classes of Levin (1993) have been used as a standard verb classification within the computational linguistics community. We thus propose using these classes as the semantically similar groups over which to compare acceptability of potential complements with a given light verb.2 Our approach is related to the idea of substitutability in multiword expressions.

Our measure shows good correlations with human ratings on unseen test data. Moreover, we find that our measure correlates more strongly when the potential complements of the construction (such as walk, stroll, or run) are separated into semantically similar classes. Our analysis demonstrates the systematic nature of the semi-productivity of these constructions. 1 Light Verb Constructions Much research on multiword expressions involving verbs has focused on verb-particle constructions (VPCs), such as scale up or put down (e.g., Bannard et al., 2003; McCarthy et al., 2003; Villavicencio, 2003). Another kind of verb-based multiword expression is light verb constructions (LVCs), such as the examples in (1). (1) a. Sara took a stroll along the beach. b. Paul gave a knock on the door. c. Jamie made a pass to her teammate. These constructions, like VPCs, may extend the meaning of the component words in interesting ways, may be (semi-)productive, and may or may not be compositional. Interestingly, despite these shared properties, LVCs are in some sense the opposite of VPCs. Where VPCs involve a wide range of verbs in combination with a small number of particles, LVC</context>

The light verb itself is drawn from a limited set of semantically general verbs; among the commonly used light verbs in English are take, give, make, have, and do. LVCs are highly productive in some languages, such as Persian, Urdu, and Japanese (Karimi, 1997; Butt, 2003; Miyamoto, 2000). In languages such as French, Italian, Spanish and English, LVCs are semi-productive constructions (Wierzbicka, 1982; Alba-Salas, 2002; Kearns, 2002). The syntactic and semantic properties of the complement of an LVC determine distinct types of constructions. Kearns (2002) distinguishes between two usages of light verbs in LVCs: what she calls a true light verb (TLV), as in give a groan, and what she calls a vague action verb (VAV), as in give a speech. The main difference between these two types of light verb usages is that the complement of a TLV is claimed to be headed by a verb. Wierzbick</context>

Moreover, we find that our measure correlates more strongly when the potential complements of the construction (such as walk, stroll, or run) are separated into semantically similar classes. Our analysis demonstrates the systematic nature of the semi-productivity of these constructions. 1 Light Verb Constructions Much research on multiword expressions involving verbs has focused on verb-particle constructions (VPCs), such as scale up or put down (e.g., Bannard et al., 2003; McCarthy et al., 2003; Villavicencio, 2003). Another kind of verb-based multiword expression is light verb constructions (LVCs), such as the examples in (1). (1) a. Sara took a stroll along the beach. b. Paul gave a knock on the door. c. Jamie made a pass to her teammate. These constructions, like VPCs, may extend the meaning of the component words in interesting ways, may be (semi-)productive, and may or may not be compositional. Interestingly, despite these shared properties, LVCs are in some sense the opposite of VPCs. Where VPCs involve a wide range of verbs in combination with a small number of particles, LVCs involve a small numb</context>

For instance, an exact phrase search for “take a cry” would return a web page which had the text It was too much to take. A cry escaped his lips. When searching for an unattested LVC, these noisy results can begin to dominate. In ongoing work, we are devising some automatic clean-up methods to eliminate some of the false positives. On the other hand, it should be pointed out that not all “good” LVCs will appear in our corpus, despite its size. In this view we differ from Villavicencio (2003), who assumes that if a multiword expression is not found in the Google index, then it is not a good construction. As an example, consider The clown took a cavort across the stage. The LVC seems plausible; however, Google returns no results for “took a cavort”. This underlines the need for determining plausible (as opposed to attested) LVCs, which class-based generalization has the potential to support. 4.3 Extraction To measure mutual information, we gather several counts for each potential LVC: the frequency of the LVC (e.g., give a cry), the frequency of the light verb (e.g., give), and the</context>

It has been argued that the usage of a light verb adds a telic component to the event in most cases (Wierzbicka, 1982; Butt, 2003); though see Folli et al. (2003) for telicity in Persian LVCs. Our approach draws on a linguistic analysis, presented in Section 2, in which the complement of this type of LVC (e.g., a walk in take a walk) is—in spite of the presence of the determiner a—actually a verbal element (Wierzbicka, 1982; Kearns, 2002). Section 3 describes how this analysis motivates both a method for generalizing over verb classes to find potential valid complements for a light verb, and a mutual information measure that takes the linguistic properties of this type of LVC into account. In Section 4, we outline how we collect the corpus statistics on which we base our measures intended to distinguish “good” LVCs from poor ones. Section 5 describes the experiments in which we determine human ratings of potential LVCs, and correlate those with our mutual information measures. As predicted, the correlations reve</context>

Because of their interesting and distinctive properties, we have restricted our initial investigation to light verb constructions with TLVs, i.e. “LV a V” constructions, as in give a groan. For simplicity, we will continue to refer to them here generally as LVCs. The meaning of an LVC of this type is almost equivalent to the meaning of the verbal complement (cf. (1) and (2) in Section 1). However, the light verb does contribute to the meaning of the construction, as can be seen by the fact that there are constraints on which light verb can occur with which complement (Wierzbicka, 1982). For example, one can give a cry but not *take a cry. The acceptability depends on semantic properties of the complement, and, as we explore below, may generalize in consistent ways across semantically similar (complement) verbs, as in give a cry, give a moan, give a howl; *take a cry, *take a moan, *take a howl. Many interesting questions pertaining to the syntactic and semantic properties of LVCs have been examined in the linguistic literature: How does the semantics of an LVC relate to the semantics of its parts? How does the type of the complement affect the meaning of an LVC? Why do cert</context>
