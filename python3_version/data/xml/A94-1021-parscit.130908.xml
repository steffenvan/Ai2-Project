<bodyText confidence="0.99406805882353">
Ordinary use of Natural Language adheres to what
Grice has called the &amp;quot;cooperative principle of conver-
sation&amp;quot; (Grice, 1975). Four categories of &amp;quot;maxims&amp;quot;
elaborate this principle. Under the category of Re-
lation, Grice places the single maxim &amp;quot;Be relevant&amp;quot;,
noting that this terse formulation conceals a num-
ber of unsolved problems, including that of &amp;quot;what
different kinds and focuses of relevance there may
be&amp;quot;.
This paper addresses &amp;quot;kinds and focuses of rele-
vance&amp;quot; that a language-generating clinical decision-
support system should adhere to during patient-
centered activities — that is, activities in which a
health care provider&apos;s (HCP) attention is on his
or her patient and not on a computer screen.&apos;
Such activities include surgery, childbirth, and emer-
gency medical care (including the responsibilities of
Emergency Medical Technicians). During patient-
centered activities, utterances generated by a com-
puter system intrude on patient management. They
must be seen by HCPs as having immediate clinical
relevance, or, like the continual ringing of ICU mon-
itors, they will be ignored. Utterances that would
not make a clinically significant difference to patient
management must be avoided. This paper describes
how plan recognition and plan evaluation can be
used to achieve this end.
This work is being done in the context of the
TraumAID project (Clarke et al., 1993; Clarke et
al., 1994; Rymon et al., 1993; Webber et al., 1992),
&apos;In this sense, our emphasis differs from Sperber and
Wilson (Sperber and Wilson, 1986), who are concerned
with the problem of inferences that can be made under
the assumption of relevance.

whose overall goal is to improve the delivery of qual-
ity trauma care during the initial definitive phase of
patient management. Initial definitive management
scopes a complex range of diagnostic and therapeu-
tic procedures. Resolving often conflicting demands
for managing multiple injuries requires global rea-
soning that can exceed the restricted locality of rule—
based systems. The modular architecture of the cur-
rent system, TraumAID 2.0, consists of two comple-
mentary processes: (1) a rule-based reasoner able to
draw diagnostic conclusions and identify what goals
each of them implies; and (2) a planner that takes
the set of currently relevant goals and constructs a
management plan — a partially-ordered sequence of
actions — that is most appropriate at that point in
time.
TraumAID 2.0 has been retrospectively validated
against actual trauma management plans for 97 non-
pregnant adult patients presenting consecutively to
the Medical College of Pennsylvania (MCP) Trauma
Center with penetrating injuries to the chest and/or
abdomen. A blinded comparison of management
plans was carried out by a panel of three experienced
trauma surgeons. They preferred TraumAID 2.0&apos;s
plans to actual management to a statistically signif-
icant extent (Clarke et al., 1993).
A decision support system will not be clinically
viable without solving its interface problems. For
us, this means (1) getting TraumAID the informa-
tion it needs for its reasoning and planning, and (2)
getting the results of TraumAID&apos;s reasoning to the
members of the trauma team (in particular, to the
chief surgical resident) during the course of care.
To get information into TraumAID, we have de-
veloped an electronic version of a standard trauma
flow sheet, so that information can be entered by the
scribe nurse during the trauma resuscitation.2 The
electronic trauma flow sheet is implemented in Hy-
perCard, supported by a FoxPro database. Relevant
information entered by the scribe nurse is automat-
ically passed to TraumAID 2.0.
The focus of this paper is the problem of delivering
the results of TraumAID&apos;s deliberations, given an
early pilot study that showed that physicians using
TraumAID disliked the continuous presentation of
its entire management plan. (Currently, this is dis-
played on the nurse&apos;s monitor in a separate window.)
The reasons for physician dissatisfaction appear to
be that (1) much of the time, TraumAID&apos;s recom-
2 One member of the trauma team is a nurse who func-
tions as a scribe, documenting all the findings, tests, and
treatments in chronological order for the record. The
multiple page trauma flow sheet has designated areas for
specific information, such as demographics, mechanism
of injury, physician response times, trauma score, Glas-
gow coma score, vital signs, location of wounds, results
of primary assessment, intravenous therapy, diagnostic
and therapeutic procedures, medications given, fluid in-
take and output, and disposition.
mendation coincided with the physicians&apos; own plans,
and (2) having the entire plan presented made it dif-
ficult for the physicians to determine what, if any-
thing, they should focus on. To put it another way,
presenting the entire plan violates Grice&apos;s Maxim of
Relevance.
We decided to explore how TraumAID could re-
strict commentary to only those situations in which
a comment would be clinically relevant in terms of
its potential for making a clinically significant differ-
ence to patient management. We took advantage of
the fact that actions that involve resources that need
to be brought to the trauma bay or that can only
be done elsewhere must be ordered. Since orders can
be rescinded, comments pointing out problems with
an order can potentially make a clinically significant
difference to patient management. Our prototype
interface for TraumAID produces commentary when
an order differs significantly from what TraumAID
would recommend. It also generates commentary
when the physician fails to order something that
TraumAID thinks should be done within the imme-
diate time frame. The interface, TraumaTIQ (Gert-
ner, 1994; Gertner, 1994b), uses plan inference and
plan evaluation to recognize both such errors of com-
mission and errors of omission. In this paper, we de-
scribe TraumAID&apos;s knowledge of management goals
and actions that are used in plan inference and eval-
uation (Section 2), the plan recognition and evalu-
ation strategies that allow TraumaTIQ to recognize
clinically significant differences in patient manage-
ment(Section 3), and the additional problems for
plan recognition, plan evaluation and critique gener-
ation caused by a planner&apos;s ability to optimize plans
through what Pollack has called &amp;quot;overloading inten-
tions&amp;quot; (Pollack, 1991) (Section 4). We conclude with
mention of our planned prospective evaluations of
TraumAID and TraumaTIQ and a summary of our
main points (Section 5).

2 The Representational Framework
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999964529411765">
In TraumAID, a plan is a set of procedures, each of
which comprises one or more actions. Procedures
are used to address diagnostic and therapeutic man-
agement goals motivated by what is currently known
about the patient. A particular action can partici-
pate in more than one procedure, and thus can be
used in addressing more than one goal. As noted
earlier, TraumAID uses a rule-based reasoner to de-
rive a set of relevant goals from the currently avail-
able knowledge about the patient and a planner to
choose appropriate procedures to address those goals
and schedules the actions they involve.
TraumAID&apos;s reasoner controls information acqui-
sition using a conservative, staged strategy for di-
agnosis and treatment (Rymon, 1993): expensive,
definitive tests are not included in a plan until they
are justified by less costly tests or observations, and

definitive treatment is not recommended without the
results of sufficient evidence from diagnostic tests.&apos;
These strategies are reflected in the knowledge base
by the occurrence of related management goals, such
as a goal to diagnose hematuria (blood in the urine),
which if present, triggers a goal to diagnose bladder
injury, which in turn can lead to a goal to treat blad-
der injury. Goals that do not participate together in
a coherent strategy may still be connected by test
results. For example, the goal of finding a bullet in
the mediastinum leads to doing a lateral chest x-ray.
While this might also reveal a fractured sternum,
there is no strategic relationship between the goal of
finding a bullet in the mediastinum and the goal of
treating a fractured sternum.
Once a set of relevant goals has been determined,
the planner&apos;s choice of how address each goal is
based on both local and global considerations. Goals
and procedures are linked via a goal-procedure map-
ping which lists alternative procedures for address-
ing each goal. The procedures in a mapping are
listed in order of preference so that, all else being
equal, the first procedure will be chosen to address
the goal. Less preferred procedures may be selected
if they would result in a globally more optimal (less
costly) plan. Figure 1 shows three possible configu-
rations for a portion of a plan addressing two goals.
(Section 4 discusses the consequences for plan recog-
nition, evaluation and critiquing, of the ability to
create plans in which actions and/or procedures are
shared between goals.)
Actions are scheduled according to both logistical
and clinical considerations. Logistical considerations
mean that patients are only moved in one direction
through the Trauma Center — from the emergency
center, optionally to the radiology suite, then op-
tionally to the operating suite, and finally to the

trauma unit. Since actions may have constraints on
where they can be performed, they are scheduled so
as to avoid transferring the patient back to a place
he has already been.
Clnical considerations have to do with the ur-
gency and priority of each action, which it inher-
its from the goals it is being used to address. The
urgency can be either catastrophic, unstable, or sta-
ble, representing the patient&apos;s condition and thus the
amount of time available in which to address that
goal. Catastrophic goals must be addressed imme-
diately. Unstable goals must be addressed before
stable goals. Priorities represent standard practices
of trauma care: if there are no differences in urgency,
problems involving the airway are addressed before
those involving breathing, which are addressed be-
fore those involving circulation, etc. (the &amp;quot;ABCs of
trauma care&amp;quot;).

3 Interpreting and Reacting to
Orders
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99995605">
We have claimed that in patient-centered activities,
the effectiveness of a &amp;quot;by-stander&amp;quot; decision-support
system depends on focusing its clinical role on the
immediate needs of physicians rather than interven-
ing with information that, while correct and apro-
pos, would not make a significant difference to pa-
tient management. In order to achieve this, our
approach is largely reactive rather than proactive.
As noted in Section 1, instead of presenting Traum-
AID&apos;s recommended management plan, TraumaTIQ
waits for the physician&apos;s orders, which are treated
as intentions to perform those actions. TraumaTIQ
interprets and evaluates these intentions, and gen-
erates a comment if it would be relevant to do so.
TraumaTIQ also interprets the lack of an ordered
action within an appropriate time frame as indicat-
ing the physician&apos;s lack of intention to perform that
action and evaluates it as such. This approach is a
form of critiquing, early examples of which are (Lan-
glotz and Shortliffe, 1983; Miller, 1986).
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.989085">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999913647058824">
TraumaTIQ&apos;s critiquing process is triggered
whenever new information is entered by the scribe
nurse and delivered to TraumAID. This information
can be in the form of (1) bedside findings, (2) di-
agnostic test results (indicating both that a diag-
nostic action has been performed and what the re-
sults of that action were), (3) therapeutic actions
performed, or (4) diagnostic or therapeutic actions
ordered by the physician. TraumaTIQ interprets the
physician&apos;s orders in a goal-directed manner, using
TraumAID&apos;s representation of goals, procedures and
actions, so that the critique can address the likely
reasons underlying any discrepancies and can sug-
gest alternative means of addressing a particular
goal. Figure 2 shows the architecture of Trauma-
TIQ, comprising plan recognition, plan evaluation,
and critique generation.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997502">
3.1 Plan Recognition
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999831257142857">
In order to judge when it is relevant to comment
on a physicians orders or lack thereof, it is useful to
consider not only what actions have been ordered,
but also why. For example, this can allow comments
to be withheld if an ordered action that differs from
TraumAID&apos;s choice would nevertheless satisfy perti-
nent management goals. TraumaTIQ&apos;s plan recog-
nition component aims to infer the underlying goal
structure motivating the physician&apos;s orders for ac-
tions to be performed. Note that this is an example
of keyhole recognition, rather than intended recogni-
tion (Kautz, 1990). The physician does not intend to
provide enough information to allow others to infer
his plans. Like other members of the trauma team,
TraurnaTIQ must infer the plan incrementally based
on what is known about the patient and what has
been ordered so far.
Trauma management poses particular problems
for plan recognition. First, there is no fully pre-
set sequence in which actions are ordered and done.
Secondly, multiple diagnostic and therapeutic goals
may simultaneously be active, and a single action
can often be used to address several related or un-
related goals. In this domain, it would thus be in-
correct to simplify search by minimizing the number
of top-level goals in the inferred plan, as Kautz and
others have proposed (Kautz, 1990). Third, a plan
recognition strategy cannot assume that the physi-
cian&apos;s plan is correct: management of trauma pa-
tients must often be done late at night and under
time pressure, conditions that can lead to less than
optimal decision-making even in trained profession-
als. Since the number of possible incorrect plans is
too large to encode a priori, we must make certain
assumptions about physicians&apos; plans:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9875966">
• The head of a trauma team will have expert or
near-expert knowledge of trauma, and will usu-
ally develop plans that are similar to Traum-
AID&apos;s. Thus, if an action has been ordered
that is also in TraumAID&apos;s plan, TraumaTIQ
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.632795">
assumes that it is being done for the same rea-
son(s). We call this giving the physician the
&amp;quot;benefit of the doubt.&amp;quot;
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.888955628571429">
• The physician is more likely to have appropriate
goals but be addressing them in a sub-optimal
way, than to be pursuing the wrong goals alto-
gether.
• While TraumAID follows a conservative strat-
egy for pursuing diagnosis and treatment from
observations, physicians may proceed more
rapidly, pursuing a goal that may be involved
in a current strategy but for which TraumAID
does not yet have enough evidence to conclude
its relevance. An understanding of the strate-
gic relationships between goals should help to
recognize examples of this difference.
Reflecting these assumptions, the plan recognition
algorithm works as follows:
1. When an action, a, is ordered by the physician,
check whether a is currently a part of Traum-
AID&apos;s recommended plan as a means of satisfy-
ing all or part of goal 7, or all or part of each
member of a set of goals r.
2. If so, add 7 or F to the representation of the
physician&apos;s plan.
3. If a is not currently in TraumAID&apos;s plan, de-
termine whether there is a relevant goal that a
might address:
(a) If any of the goals that might lead to doing
a are present in TraumAID&apos;s current set of
active goals, assume that a is being done
to address that goal or goals.
(b) In the case that there is no relevant goal
to explain why the physician is ordering a,
check whether any of the possible goals mo-
tivating a are part of a currently active di-
agnostic strategy (cf. Section 2).
(c) If no relevant goal or strategy is found,
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.984743666666667">
leave the goal unspecified and add the in-
tention to do a to the representation of
the physician&apos;s plan with no goal attached.
There is one exception to this rule:
(d) If the system only knows of one possible
goal that would lead to performing a, Trau-
maTIQ assumes that a is being done to
address that goal, even though it does not
consider the goal to be relevant.

3.2 Plan Evaluation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998458857142857">
After attempting to infer the goal(s) underlying the
physician&apos;s actions, TraurnaTIQ attempts to identify
whether commentary is warranted on any aspects
of his plan. Plan evaluation begins by comparing
the plan attributed to the physician with the plan
produced by TraumAID, looking for four types of
discrepancies:

<listItem confidence="0.999622947368421">
• Omission: A goal that TraumAID considers rel-
evant is not being addressed by the physician
in a timely manner. This can be further an-
alyzed as to whether (1) the goal is not being
addressed at all, or (2) the goal is only being
partially addressed — some but not all the ac-
tions in the procedure addressing the goal have
been ordered.
• Commission: An action is present in the physi-
cian&apos;s plan that does not address a relevant goal.
If a unique goal can be inferred to explain this
discrepancy, that goal can be further catego-
rized as to whether (1) it is unwarranted, (2) it
is not fully proven, or (3) it has already been
addressed.
• Procedure choice: A relevant goal is being ad-
dressed, but not using the procedure preferred
by TraumAID.
• Scheduling: Actions are not being done in the
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.961621954545455">
order recommended by Traumaid, e.g., satisfy-
ing urgent goals before non-urgent ones.
TraumaTIQ upholds the Maxim of Relevance by
attempting to avoid comments that may later prove
irrelevant. Errors of omission are not critiqued until
a sufficient period of time has elapsed during which
the physician might order the action. The amount
of time allowed depends on the urgency of the goal
that the action is intended to address — the rule of
thumb TraumaTIQ uses is that a comment should
be produced after approximately 10% of the time
period has passed that is available to address the
goal without significant consequences. Furthermore,
comments are only made with respect to goals that
cannot be made irrelevant by actions scheduled to
be done before those goals are addressed.
Discrepancies of all types are then evaluated in
terms of their potential clinical significance. Cur-
rently this is only a rough estimate based on ap-
proximate cost and whether or not a procedure is
invasive. For example, an unnecessary chest x-ray is
considered insignificant while an unnecessary (and
invasive) laparotomy is considered clinically signif-
icant and worth drawing to the physician&apos;s atten-
tion. We are currently in the process of developing
more objective criteria for classifying errors accord-
ing to their potential impact on the outcome of the
case. Each discrepancy will be classified as either:
(1) tolerable, probably harmless, (2) non-critical, but
potentially harmful, or (3) critical, potentially fatal.
Anything in the second or third category will be con-
sidered significant enough to be reported in the cri-
tique, while tolerable errors will not be mentioned.
The output of plan evaluation is a set of com-
municative goals containing (1) a propositional con-
tent (PC) indicating the type of discrepancy and the
particular TraumAID concepts involved, and (2) an
illocutionary force (IF), such as URGE, INFORM or
REMIND, indicating how the information should be
realized linguistically. For example, the goal:

would be produced in a situation in which the physi-
cian has ordered a CT-scan of the abdomen, which
TraumaTIQ has inferred is intended to address the
goal of diagnosing a compound fracture of the lum-
bar vertebra, which TraumAID has instead chosen
to address with a considerably less costly, less time-
consuming lateral abdominal X-ray. The illocution-
ary force of SUGGEST indicates that this is a non-
critical error. Had it been evaluated as a critical
error, the illocutionary force would have been URGE.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999841">
3.3 Critique Generation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999841178571429">
Critique generation serves to organize TraumaTIQ&apos;s
communicative goals according to the management
goals they address and to translate them into Nat-
ural Language utterances. This is currently the
least sophisticated part of the process: each IF-PC
pair indexes a sentential template with syntactically
marked slots to be filled in with the appropriate
phrasal translation of a TraumAID concept. For ex-
ample, the template indexed by (SUGGEST, PROCE-
DURE CHOICE) is:
&amp;quot;TraumAID suggests (ARG1 GERUN-
DIVE) rather than (ARG2 GERUN-
DIVE). The former is preferred for (ARG3
GERUNDIVE).&amp;quot;
The first and second slots are filled in with gerun-
dive phrases corresponding to GET-X-RAY-LAT-
ABD and GET-CT-SCAN-ABD, while the third slot
is filled in with an untensed verb phrase corre-
sponding to RU-COMPOUND-FRACTURE-LUMBAR-
VERTEBRA, resulting in the sentence:
&amp;quot;TraumAID suggests getting a lateral X-
Ray of the abdomen rather than getting a
CT-scan of the abdomen. The former is
preferred for checking for fracture of the
lumbar vertebrae.&amp;quot;
Critiques can be delivered directly to the trauma
bay through synthesized speech or to the scribe
nurse for subsequent delivery to the trauma team.

4 Action Overloading
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999988697674419">
As mentioned earlier, it is possible for a single action
to participate in addressing more than one manage-
ment goal. This strategy of doubling-up the use of
plan elements is called intention overloading by Pol-
lack (Pollack, 1991), who argues that it can simplify
the process of computing optimal plans. It can, how-
ever, complicate the process of recognizing and eval-
uating them. Our strategy in TraumaTIQ is to as-
sume that overloading occurs in the physician&apos;s plan
whenever it would be beneficial. In other words, if
an action ordered by the physician can be used to ad-
dress two or more relevant goals, it is assumed that
that is what the physician intends. This assump-
tion makes sense because as long as both goals are
being addressed, there is no need to produce a cri-
tique, even if the physician did not have both goals
in mind
If, on the other hand, there is a possibility for over-
loading that the physician does not exploit, it may
be clinically relevant to mention it. For example,
consider a patient with a gunshot wound to the ab-
domen, loss of sensation in both legs, and hematuria
(Figure 3a). From the first two findings, TraumAID
derives a goal of diagnosing a compound fracture of
the lumbar vertebra, and from the type of wound
and the finding of hematuria it derives a goal of di-
agnosing renal injury. Both goals can be addressed
by a single abdominal CT-scan.
Figure 3b shows the plan that is inferred from the
physician&apos;s order of a lateral abdominal x-ray, which
is appropriate for the goal of diagnosing a fractured
vertebra, but not for diagnosing renal injury. In this
situation, two points are clinically relevant: (1) the
goal of diagnosing renal injury should be addressed,
and (2) both goals can be addressed with the single
action of an abdominal CT-scan, obviating the need
to do an X-ray to address one&apos;of them. In this case a
comment such as the following would be produced:
&amp;quot;TraumAID suggests getting an abdominal
CT-scan rather than a lateral abdominal
X-ray. The former can be used both to di-
agnose renal injury and to diagnose a com-
pound fracture of the lumbar vertebrae.&amp;quot;

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99993124">
We have presented an approach to information de-
livery during patient-centered activities, in which a
health care provider&apos;s (HCP) attention is on his or
her patient and not on a computer screen. As well
as potential applications to other areas of medical
care, the idea of restricting the output of a decision-
support system to clinically relevant information can
be generalized to other task-centered activities, such
as repair or construction, in which the person for
whom the system output is intended is focused on
performing a task rather than on the system.
We recognize the need to validate the approach de-
scribed here, and have proposed (with Sandra Car-
berry, of the University of Delaware) such a study to
the National Library of Medicine. In this study, we
will compare two versions of our approach against
graphic display of the stable portion of TraumAID&apos;s
management plan on a monitor positioned in the
trauma bay. In one version of our approach, cri-
tiques of physician orders (or lack thereof) will be
conveyed textually to the scribe nurse, who will con-
vey it to the other members of the trauma team at
his or her discretion. In the other version, critiques
will be conveyed directly to the trauma bay through
synthesized speech.

Given an early pilot study that showed that physicians using Traum- AID disliked the continuous presentation of its entire management plan, we decided to explore how TraumAID could restrict commentary to only those situations in which a comment could make a clinically significant difference to patient management.

TraumAID 2.0 has been retrospectively validated against actual trauma management plans for 97 nonpregnant adult patients presenting consecutively to the Medical College of Pennsylvania (MCP) Trauma Center with penetrating injuries to the chest and/or abdomen. A blinded comparison of management plans was carried out by a panel of three experienced trauma surgeons. They preferred TraumAID 2.0&apos;s plans to actual management to a statistically significant extent (Clarke et al., 1993). A decision support system will not be clinically viable without solving its interface problems. For us, this means (1) getting TraumAID the information it needs for its reasoning and planning, and (2) getting the results of TraumAID&apos;s reasoning to the members of the trauma team (in particular, to the chief surgical resident) during the course of care. To get information into TraumAID, we have developed an electronic version of a standard trauma flow sheet, so that information can be entered by the scribe nurse during the trauma resuscitation.2 The electronic trauma flow sheet is implemented </context>

Four categories of &amp;quot;maxims&amp;quot; elaborate this principle. Under the category of Relation, Grice places the single maxim &amp;quot;Be relevant&amp;quot;, noting that this terse formulation conceals a number of unsolved problems, including that of &amp;quot;what different kinds and focuses of relevance there may be&amp;quot;. This paper addresses &amp;quot;kinds and focuses of relevance&amp;quot; that a language-generating clinical decisionsupport system should adhere to during patientcentered activities — that is, activities in which a health care provider&apos;s (HCP) attention is on his or her patient and not on a computer screen.&apos; Such activities incl</context>

For example, this can allow comments to be withheld if an ordered action that differs from TraumAID&apos;s choice would nevertheless satisfy pertinent management goals. TraumaTIQ&apos;s plan recognition component aims to infer the underlying goal structure motivating the physician&apos;s orders for actions to be performed. Note that this is an example of keyhole recognition, rather than intended recognition (Kautz, 1990). The physician does not intend to provide enough information to allow others to infer his plans. Like other members of the trauma team, TraurnaTIQ must infer the plan incrementally based on what is known about the patient and what has been ordered so far. Trauma management poses particular problems for plan recognition. First, there is no fully preset sequence in which actions are ordered and done. Secondly, multiple diagnostic and therapeutic goals may simultaneously be active, and a single action can often be used to address several related or unrelated goals. In this domain, it would thus </context>

We conclude with mention of our planned prospective evaluations of TraumAID and TraumaTIQ and a summary of our main points (Section 5). 2 The Representational Framework In TraumAID, a plan is a set of procedures, each of which comprises one or more actions. Procedures are used to address diagnostic and therapeutic management goals motivated by what is currently known about the patient. A particular action can participate in more than one procedure, and thus can be used in addressing more than one goal. As noted earlier, TraumAID uses a rule-based reasoner to derive a set of relev</context>

The former is preferred for checking for fracture of the lumbar vertebrae.&amp;quot; Critiques can be delivered directly to the trauma bay through synthesized speech or to the scribe nurse for subsequent delivery to the trauma team. 4 Action Overloading As mentioned earlier, it is possible for a single action to participate in addressing more than one management goal. This strategy of doubling-up the use of plan elements is called intention overloading by Pollack (Pollack, 1991), who argues that it can simplify the process of computing optimal plans. It can, however, complicate the process of recognizing and evaluating them. Our strategy in TraumaTIQ is to assume that overloading occurs in the physician&apos;s plan whenever it would be beneficial. In other words, if an action ordered by the physician can be used to address two or more relevant goals, it is assumed that that is what the physician intends. This assumption makes sense because as long as both goals are being addressed, there is no need to produce a critique, even if the physician did not have both goals in mi</context>

As noted earlier, TraumAID uses a rule-based reasoner to derive a set of relevant goals from the currently available knowledge about the patient and a planner to choose appropriate procedures to address those goals and schedules the actions they involve.
