This comprehensive NLP textbook is strongly
algorithm-oriented and designed for talented
computer programmers who might or might
not be linguists. The book occupies a mar-
ket niche in between that of Jurafsky and
Martin (2008) and my own humble effort
(Covington 1994); it resembles the latter in ap-
proach and the former in scope. Perhaps more
than either of those, Nugues’s book is also
useful to working professionals as a hand-
book of techniques and algorithms.
Everything is here—everything, that is, ex-
cept speech synthesis and recognition; pho-
netics receives only a four-page summary.
Those wanting to start an NLP course by cov-
ering phonetics in some depth should con-
sider Coleman (2005) as well as Jurafsky and
Martin (2008).
After a brief overview, Nugues covers cor-
pus linguistics, markup languages, text sta-
tistics, morphology, part-of-speech tagging
(two ways), parsing (several ways), seman-
tics, and discourse. “Neat” and “scruffy”
approaches are deftly interleaved and com-
pared. Unification-based grammar, event se-
mantics, and tools such as WordNet and
the Penn Treebank are covered in some de-
tail. The syntax section includes dependency
grammar and even the very recent work of
Nivre (2006), as well as partial parsing and
statistical approaches. Many important algo-
rithms are presented ready to run, or nearly
so, as Prolog or Perl code. If, for example,
you want to build a Cocke–Kasami–Younger
parser, this is the place to look for directions.
Explanations are lucid and to-the-point.
Here is an example. Nugues is discussing the
fact that, if you sample a corpus for n-grams,
some will not occur in your sample at all, but
it would be a mistake to consider the unseen
ones to be infinitely rare (frequency 0). Thus
the counts need to be adjusted:
Good-Turing estimation ... reestimates
the counts of the n-grams observed in
the corpus by discounting them, and it
shifts the probability mass it has shaved
to the unseen bigrams.
The formula follows, but the reader ap-
proaches it equipped with the unforgettable
image of someone shaving excess material
off the peaks and bulges of a histogram and
spreading it into the valleys.
This is an ambitious textbook, and, in my
opinion, too much for one semester; it must
be used selectively. If nothing is skipped, then
besides getting a thorough course in natural
language processing (except phonetics), the
student is expected to learn both Perl and
Prolog along the way, aided by a 50-page Pro-
log handbook in Appendix A. My experience
is that Prolog is very hard to learn on the
fly; in fact, extensive experience with other
languages may be a disadvantage because
Prolog is so different. Nonetheless, all the in-
formation needed to learn Prolog is here. Perl
is treated more casually because it lends itself
much more easily to incremental learning.
Other minor quibbles are possible. On
page 31, automata is used as singular. On page
69, the treatment of RTF, TEX, and LATEX is so
short that the student will come away largely
unaware of what each of them is actually de-
signed for. This is not pernicious, however,
as the student will realize that he or she is
inadequately informed.
Nonetheless, this is an unusually useful
and well-written book, and I plan to recom-
mend it to my students as well as using it
myself as a handbook.—Michael A. Covington,

Ninio proposes a provocative theory of early
syntactic development. According to her the-
ory, children do not create any abstract rep-
resentation of language in the form of rules
or schemas, nor do they develop any sys-
tematic linking rules between syntax and
semantics. Instead, they learn a lexicalist syn-
tax. Syntactic development consists of learn-
ing, for each individual word, the potential
predicate–argument relations and their ap-
propriate syntactic realizations. Semantic va-
lency (the potential semantic relations of a
word with other items) and syntactic valency
(the ways to express those relations in sen-
tences) are learned for each word separately.
The syntactic structure of a sentence is pro-
jected from the lexical valency of words by re-
cursively applying a single binary operation,
Merge, which combines the Head (the predi-
cate word) to its Dependent (the argument).
Ninio argues that the elimination of the
abstract rules from the process of syntactic
development is supported by evidence from
child language research. Examination of the
learning curves (i.e., performance vs. experi-
ence) for different syntactic patterns shows
no sudden change in children’s productiv-
ity with a particular syntactic pattern, or in
their ability to generalize that pattern to novel
items. At the same time, learning a syntac-
tic pattern speeds up with experience. The
learning curves have an accelerating nonlin-
ear shape, which suggests that the acquired
item-specific syntactic forms facilitate the ac-
quisition of the same syntactic form for new
items. Ninio suggests that, even though the
knowledge of syntax is item-specific, lexical
items are not isolated. Instead, they are in-
terconnected via transfer, the ability to extend
what has been learned in one context to new
contexts by analogy. The notion of transfer is
supposed to explain children’s nonlinear
learning curve, as well as their ability to gen-
eralize their lexical knowledge to novel items.
However, the details of this central mech-
anism are left unspecified: it is not clear
how and under which constraints the trans-
fer between two items can take place. More-
over, one expects that the interplay be-
tween the item-specific knowledge and the
transfer of learning be used to explain some
well-studied stages of language learning in
children, including imitation, (over)generali-
zation, and recovery from making overgen-
eralization errors. (This so-called U-shaped
learning curve is quite distinct from the non-
linear learning curve that gives the book its
title.)
Another radical proposal by Ninio is that
semantic similarity plays no role in early syn-
tactic development. More specifically, trans-
fer of learning, and therefore generalization,
is based solely on a similarity of form. The de-
velopmental evidence provided for this claim
is intriguing. For example, in the priming
experiments where training on a large set
of verbs that appear in transitive sentences
helps to elicit transitive usages from chil-
dren on novel nonce verbs, the semantic sim-
ilarity between the training and the testing
verbs does not affect the rate of generaliza-
tion. However, there are many studies show-
ing that both children and adults use some
kind of mapping between form and mean-
ing in comprehension tasks. For example,
preferential-looking studies show that infants
choose one novel action over another based
on the form of the sentence introducing the
action (e.g., Naigles 1990; Fisher 2002). Sim-
ilarly, adult subjects predict certain semantic
properties for the arguments of a novel verb
based on the form of the sentence the verb
appears in (e.g., Gleitman 1990; Kako 2006).
In the absence of any abstract rules, these
findings can be explained only through a gen-
eralization mechanism that takes into account
both syntactic and semantic similarity.
Despite the vagueness of some of the
suggested mechanisms and occasional in-
sufficient analysis, Ninio’s book presents a
thought-provoking account of syntactic de-
velopment that can be of especial interest
to the computational linguistics community.
Its proposed view of syntax could be val-
idated through computational modeling. If

it turns out that the proposed theory is in-
deed compatible with empirical data, the
underlying ideas could be directly applied
to the representation and use of syntactic
knowledge in different computational lin-
guistic applications.—Afra Alishahi, Univer-

“The chapters in this book jointly contribute
to what we shall call the field of natural
and multimodal interactive systems engi-
neering. This is not yet a well-established
field of research and commercial develop-
ment but, rather, an emerging one in all as-
pects. It brings together, in a process that,
arguably, was bound to happen, contribu-
tors from many different, and often far more
established, fields of research and industrial
development. To mention but a few, these in-
clude speech technology, computer graphics,
and computer vision. The field’s rapid ex-
pansion seems driven by a shared vision of
the potential of new interactive modalities of
information representation and exchange for
radically transforming the world of computer
systems, networks, devices, applications, and
so on, from the GUI (graphical user interface)
paradigm into something which will enable
a far deeper and much more intuitive and
natural integration of computer systems into
people’s work and lives.
“Jointly, the chapters present a broad
and detailed picture of where natural and
multimodal interactive systems engineering
stands today. The book is based on select-
ed presentations made at the International
Workshop on Natural, Intelligent, and Ef-
fective Interaction in Multimodal Dialogue
Systems held in Copenhagen, Denmark, in
2002 and sponsored by the European CLASS
project. CLASS was initiated on the request
of the European Commission with the pur-
pose of supporting and stimulating collab-
oration among Human Language Technology
(HLT) projects as well as between HLT
projects and relevant projects outside Europe.
The purpose of the workshop was to bring
together researchers from academia and in-
dustry to discuss innovative approaches and
challenges in natural and multimodal interac-
tive systems engineering.”—From the editors’

“This book has its point of departure in
courses held at the Tenth European Lan-

mer School on Language and Speech
Communication which took place at NISLab
in Odense, Denmark, in July 2002. The topic
of the summer school was ‘Evaluation and
Assessment of Text and Speech Systems.’
“Nine (groups of) lecturers contributed to
the summer school with courses on evalua-
tion of a range of important aspects of text
and speech systems, including speaker rec-
ognition, speech synthesis, talking animated
interface agents, part-of-speech tagging and
parsing technologies, machine translation,
question-answering and information retriev-
al systems, spoken dialogue systems, lan-
guage resources, and methods and formats
for the representation and annotation of
language resources. Eight of these (groups
of) lecturers agreed to contribute a chapter to
the present book. Since we wanted to keep all
the aspects covered by the summer school, an
additional author was invited to address the
area of speaker recognition and to add speech
recognition, which we felt was important
to include in the book. Although the point
of departure for the book was the ELSNET
summer school held in 2002, the decision to
make a book was made considerably later.
Thus the work on the chapters was only
initiated in 2004. First drafts were submitted
and reviewed in 2005 and final versions were
ready in 2006.”—From the editors’ preface

“Advances in technology have helped create
a connected world, and this is none more
apparent than in the area of text entry. The
growing popularity and success of textual
communication has inspired a variety of text
entry systems, modalities, and users. There
is a text entry system that will meet the
needs of all kinds of users—a teen sending an
IM with her phone, a businessman checking
e-mail on his blackberry, or a visually im-
paired woman using a Braille keyboard on
her PDA. The capabilities and modalities of
text entry are widespread and evolving.
“Text Entry Systems is a guidebook on
the details and foundations of text entry
methods, the effectiveness of current modes
of text entry, advances in technology, and
the creation of new systems. Authorita-
tive researchers from the fields of HCI,
handwriting recognition, speech recognition,
computational linguistics, natural language
processing, universal access, industrial de-
sign, cognitive science, and image process-
ing all provide their expertise. They address
the wide reach of this technology, including
design for various languages and accommo-
dations for those with special physical condi-
tions, using specific examples and offering
solutions.”—From the publisher’s announcement

<context position="1463" citStr="(2006)" startWordPosition="225" endWordPosition="225">nting to start an NLP course by covering phonetics in some depth should consider Coleman (2005) as well as Jurafsky and Martin (2008). After a brief overview, Nugues covers corpus linguistics, markup languages, text statistics, morphology, part-of-speech tagging (two ways), parsing (several ways), semantics, and discourse. “Neat” and “scruffy” approaches are deftly interleaved and compared. Unification-based grammar, event semantics, and tools such as WordNet and the Penn Treebank are covered in some detail. The syntax section includes dependency grammar and even the very recent work of Nivre (2006), as well as partial parsing and statistical approaches. Many important algorithms are presented ready to run, or nearly so, as Prolog or Perl code. If, for example, you want to build a Cocke–Kasami–Younger parser, this is the place to look for directions. Explanations are lucid and to-the-point. Here is an example. Nugues is discussing the fact that, if you sample a corpus for n-grams, some will not occur in your sample at all, but it would be a mistake to consider the unseen ones to be infinitely rare (frequency 0). Thus the counts need to be adjusted: Good-Turing estimation ... reestimates </context>
