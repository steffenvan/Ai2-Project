Linguistic Databases is an edited collection of papers on the use of databases in linguis-
tics. It comprises a selection of 12 contributions to the conference with the same title,
which was held at the University of Groningen on 23-24 March 1995.
The need for data management tools in linguistics is evident. Although collections
of linguistic data grew rapidly in the past, the development of suitable database struc-
tures and management systems is still in an early stage. The articles presented in the
book introduce a variety of approaches to several kinds of applications in different
fields of linguistics. They are generally based on existing encoding schemes and data
management standards. The fields of study considered here include data-organization
approaches to syntactic corpora and phonetic data, the management of theoretical lin-
guistic data, such as syllable structures and nominal argument structures, applications
to linguistic problems such as the simplification of texts, and the extension of existing
systems and the interaction between them.
Two articles consider the management of &amp;quot;test suites&amp;quot; of linguistic phenomena.
In the first article, by Stephan Oepen et al., linguistic examples of language-specific
phenomena, such as complementation and agreement, were organized in a relational
database structure that can be linked to a syntactic parser and grammar. The project
emphasizes the development of a consistent annotation scheme and introduces two
implementations based on standard tools and a public-domain C library, respectively,
based on the commercial DBMS FoxPro (Microsoft). In the second article, the appli-
cation of SGML for the annotation of linguistic test suites is discussed. The author,
Martin Volk, shows the applicability of SGML for this task but also points out prob-
lems with redundancy and efficiency when using an SGML annotation scheme. A third
article on syntactic data management introduces an approach that combines standard
database query systems with SGML-encoded texts. A newly defined query language,
SgmlQL, is described, which represents an extension of the standard query language
for relational databases SQL. In this language, database queries can be formulated and
applied to process hierarchic SGML structures (tree manipulation), for instance, in or-
der to extract information. Furthermore, a freely available prototype was developed
that implements a subset of this query language.
Four articles deal with phonetic data. Werner Deutsch et al. introduce an imple-
mentation of a database management system (S-Tools) for acoustic data. This system
includes graphical editors and specialized tools for classifying and handling phonetic
data. The implementation is based on existing DBMSs (askSam and MS Access) and
is applied to a database of Austrian German and a database of child speech in four

languages. A second article on phonetic databases describes two collections of tele-
phone speech in Swiss Frenchâ€”PolyPhone and PolyVar. The article focuses on data
acquisition and the standardization of the annotation of speech data. Furthermore, a
verification tool for automatic and semi-automatic processing is introduced. The pa-
per by Edgar Haimerl describes a system for creating dialect atlas maps based on a
phonetic database. It can be considered as a front-end for the management and the
visualization of phonetic data that were stored in a XBase database. The last article on
phonetic data deals with syllable structures. In this project, a database of phonotactic
statements was set up for data from more than 200 languages. The software is based
on a finite-state automaton using a syllable grammar for each language. The system
facilitates search for syllables specific to a given language.
Three articles deal with applications of different linguistic tasks. Andrew Bre-
denkamp et al. emphasize the management of Russian verb nominalization. The au-
thors describe a database of about 2,000 verbs and their corresponding nominalizations
managed by Microsoft&apos;s DBMS, MS Access. The paper by Sylviane Granger focuses
on the management of a learner corpus for applications in language instruction. The
author discusses the use of such a corpus for the identification of common errors by
investigating texts by learners and comparing them to texts by native speakers. The
work is based on the International Corpus of Learner English (ICLE), which includes
about 300,000 words. In the paper by Siobhan Devlin et al., a system for simplifying
texts for aphasic readers is introduced. The program is based on the Oxford Psycholin-
guistic Database and the on-line reference lexicon WordNet. Basically, the program is
designed to replace difficult words with more common synonyms to increase the read-
ability of the text. Furthermore, possibilities for syntactic simplifications are discussed
in the article.
The last two articles focus on the extension of existing systems. Oliver Christ
introduces an approach to the connection of the WordNet thesaurus with the IMS
corpus query tool. For this purpose, dynamic attributes have to be declared in the
query module, which may be passed to external tools. The article concludes with a
detailed discussion of efficiency problems with the use of dynamic attributes. The last
article focuses on multilingual data processing in an object-oriented environment. The
system used for this purpose is called CELLAR and was developed at the Summer
Institute of Linguistics. It is based on object-oriented concepts and can be used to
create a &amp;quot;truly multilingual&amp;quot; environment, which means that different languages can
be handled in one document at the same time and the system automatically adapts to
specific language needs.
In his introduction to the book (18 pages), the editor introduces the contributors,
presents the problem, and summarizes the individual papers. The book comprises a
selection of papers that were submitted to the conference on linguistic databases in
Groningen. The topics discussed in the articles are very task specific and have their
origin in very different fields of linguistic research. The papers present informative
introductions to the systems they use. The main issue of the book is the description
of linguistic data acquisition and organization. The connection to general database
design and development is not very strong. The systems, basically, apply quite simple
approaches to the storage of linguistic data. The authors propose collections of files
with suitable query tools or simple-structured relational databases based on standard
software like MS Access or MS FoxPro. However, there are two exceptions to this
strategy: the database organization of syllable structures, which includes a grammatical
transcription based on finite-state techniques, and the object-oriented system based on
the CELLAR environment.

The book does not provide a general view of the topic of linguistic databases and
its concepts. However, it should be of interest to people who want to take a closer
look at the systems that are introduced in the book.
JOrg Tiedemann is a research assistant at the Department of Linguistics, Uppsala University.
His major research interests focus on the automatic processing of parallel text. Currently, he is
working on the extraction of lexical translation data from a sentence-linked multilingual corpus,
and the organization of the data in a lexical database that is linked to the corpus from which
they were extracted. Tiedemann&apos;s address is: Uppsala University, Department of Linguistics,
