We address the problem of how to develop and assess algorithms for tracking local focus and for
proposing referents of pronouns. Previous focusing research has not adequately addressed the
processing of complex sentences. We discuss issues involved in processing complex sentences and
review a methodology used by other researchers to develop their focusing frameworks. We identify
difficulties with that methodology and difficulties with using a corpus analysis to extend focusing
frameworks to handle complex sentences. We introduce a new methodology for extending focusing
frameworks, which involves two steps. In the first step, a set of systematically constructed texts
are used to identify an extension of the focusing framework to handle a particular kind of complex
sentence. In the second step, a corpus analysis is used to confirm the extension. We explain how
our methodology overcomes the difficulties faced by other approaches.

1. Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999248125">
The central problem addressed in this work is how to develop and assess algorithms
for tracking local focus and for proposing referents of pronouns for use in natural
language processing (NLP) systems.&apos; By &amp;quot;local focus,&amp;quot; we refer to the person, object,
property, or concept that a sentence is most centrally about within the discourse context
in which it occurs. The appropriate movement and marking of local focus, and the
appropriate choice of the form of a noun phrase (NP) based on local focus information,
are considered to contribute to the local coherence exhibited by discourse (Sidner
[1979], Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein [1983, 1995], Carter [1987], and others).
In addition, local focus information is one source of information that is used by
readers and hearers for interpreting pronouns. Some researchers (e.g., Hobbs 1978;
Lappin and Leass 1994) have proposed pronoun resolution algorithms that do not
involve focus tracking. However, our view is that local focus tracking and pronoun
resolution are mutually dependent processes. The local focus information influences
pronoun resolution, and pronoun resolution, in turn, influences updating focus in-
formation. Therefore, the tracking of local focus is crucial for the interpretation of
pronouns.

There have been several algorithms described in the literature for tracking local
focus information and for using this tracked information to do pronoun resolution.
In this paper we first briefly introduce the notion of local focusing and what a lo-
cal focusing algorithm is intended to capture. Generally the way that the focus of
a sentence is expected to shift through a discourse is dependent on some syntactic
properties of the sentence. However, most of the work on tracking local focus has
concentrated on simple (single clause) sentences. Thus previous work on focusing has
not adequately addressed the processing of complex (i.e., multiclausal) sentences. We
discuss a number of issues involved in the processing of complex sentences in order
to motivate the need for a methodology for extending focusing frameworks to handle
them. We review a methodology used by other researchers to develop their focusing
frameworks, and we identify some difficulties with that methodology. We examine
the possibility of using a corpus analysis to extend a focusing framework, and briefly
describe potential problems with such an approach. We then introduce our own two-
part methodology for extending focusing frameworks, which we call the Semantically
Slanted Discourse (SSD) Methodology. The first part of the methodology consists of an
exploratory phase in which possible extensions to a focusing algorithm are discovered
through the use of carefully constructed discourses that rely on the potential tension
between focusing and world-knowledge factors in pronoun resolution. We show how
this first phase can be used to propose an extension to a local focusing framework in
order to handle a given type of complex sentence. The first phase is then followed by
a corpus analysis to confirm its findings. We explain why a corpus analysis used to
confirm an extension is more practical than one used to identify an extension in the
first place.

2. What is Local Focusing?
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998036">
We use the term &amp;quot;local focusing framework&amp;quot; to refer to a theory or framework con-
sisting of a (set of) focus tracking algorithm(s) and a (set of) pronoun resolution al-
gorithm(s). A local focusing framework records and makes use of information about
focusing factors and indicates how these factors influence (intersentential) pronoun
resolution. Generally, focusing factors include such things as:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.938157">
1. Grammatical role. In several focusing frameworks (Sidner 1979; Grosz,
Joshi, and Weinstein 1983, 1995), some grammatical roles (e.g., surface
subject and surface direct object) are considered indicative of what is in
focus. Also, a pronoun resolution algorithm might prefer to find an
antecedent from a previous sentence that has the same grammatical role
as a pronoun in the current sentence.
2. Pronoun use. Most, if not all, focusing frameworks are constructed on
the basis of the belief that pronominalization is often indicative of focus.
At the same time, when an intersentential pronoun is found, a pronoun
resolution algorithm generally prefers to find an antecedent that is
highly focused in the previous sentence.
3. Constancy of focus. Many focusing frameworks assume that if an item
that was the focus of the previous sentence occurs in the current
sentence, it is more likely to be focused in the current sentence. As
above, a pronoun resolution algorithm that suggests the focus of the

previous sentence as the antecedent of a pronoun in the current sentence
would be consistent with this factor.

4. Shifting preferences. Most, if not all, focusing frameworks specify
preferences for how focus is most likely to shift if the focus of the
current sentence is not the same as the focus of the previous sentence.
5. Clue words and phrases. Most, if not all, focusing research takes into
consideration that clue words and phrases might affect pronoun
resolution and what is focused in a sentence.
6. Syntactic form. In some frameworks, certain syntactic forms (e.g., clefted
sentences) might indicate an item as highly focused.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999933454545455">
The specific list of focusing factors and the way they interact are different for
different focusing frameworks. A particular focusing framework must identify a set
of focusing factors and must indicate how these focusing factors interact to suggest
cospecifications for pronoun resolution and to identify the focus of a sentence.
A local focusing framework is not intended to independently interpret pronouns.
Rather, a local focusing framework is intended to suggest cospecifications for pronouns
in a reasonable order. An inferencing mechanism that makes use of semantic factors
(such as semantic case constraints, world knowledge, rhetorical relations, etc.) must be
used to confirm or reject a suggested cospecification. Thus, local focusing frameworks
are intended to capture a coherence factor in discourse that influences preferences for
how to resolve pronouns independent of semantic factors.

3. Processing Complex Sentences: A Reason for Extending Focusing Algorithms
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99850604">
Although complex sentences are prevalent in written English, most other local focus-
ing research (focusing: Sidner [1979] and Carter [1987]; centering: Grosz, Joshi, and
Weinstein [1983, 1995], Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard [1987], Walker [1989, 1993],
Kameyama [198612, Walker, Iida, and Cote [1994], Brennan [1998], Kameyama, Passon-
neau, and Poesio [1993], Linson [1993] and Hoffman [1998]; and PUNDIT: Dahl [1986],
Palmer et al. [1986], and Dahl and Ball [1990]) did not explicitly and/or adequately
address how to process complex sentences. Thus, there is a need to extend focusing
algorithms.
An exception to this rule is the work of Strube (1996) (which applies functional-
information-structure-based criteria on a per-clause basis), Kameyama (1998), and
Strube (1998). Kameyama&apos;s focus was on intrasentential anaphora and she attempted
to define an &amp;quot;utterance&amp;quot; in the face of syntactic complexity. Strube, in very recent work
(Strube 1998), handles arbitrary sentence complexity. Still, neither considers how par-
ticular types of complexity might affect a broad range of focusing factors.
Notice that there are a number of ways that a given type of complex sentence
might be handled by a focusing algorithm. For instance, consider processing a complex
sentence of the form &amp;quot;SX because SY,&amp;quot; where SX and SY each consist of a single clause.
One might imagine processing the SX clause and then the SY clause (i.e., resolving
the pronouns in these clauses and updating the focusing data structures) as if the
clauses were a sequence of simple (i.e., single clause) sentences. On the other hand, it
may be the case that for this type of complex sentence, the sentence should be treated
as a single unit of processing with elements of one of the clauses dominating the
2 Kameyama (1986) did address the issue of multiple subjects, but did not address the general problem
of developing a methodology for determining how a focusing framework should handle complex
sentences.

processing. (For further discussion of these and other possible processing possibilities,
see Suri [1993].)
The question we address is how one can appropriately extend a focusing mech-
anism to handle various kinds of complex sentences. We illustrate our approach by
focusing on one kind of complexity: sentences of the form &amp;quot;SX because SY&amp;quot; where SX
and SY are simple sentences. In Section 7 we discuss the application (or generalization)
of this methodology to other types of complex sentences.3

4. A Methodology Used in Other Local Focusing Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999431041666667">
Recall that local focusing theories are attempting to capture patterns of focus move-
ment and patterns of relations between anaphors and their antecedents that are inde-
pendent of semantics, world knowledge, rhetorical relations, etc. Because of this, the
method for determining how to process particular kinds of complex sentences that
might seem the most natural is to construct semantically neutral discourses4 that in-
volve the type of complex sentence under study, and gather linguistic judgments to
determine how people prefer to resolve the pronouns. In fact, in exploring other aspects
of local focusing frameworks, other literature appears to have tried to make use of
semantically neutral texts in this fashion (e.g., Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard 1987;
Walker, Iida, and Cote 1994). However, in trying to construct discourses to determine
how to process a particular kind of complex sentence, we realized it is difficult to
construct discourses that are truly semantically neutral and sound natural. This task is
further complicated by the need to construct a number of semantically neutral texts in
order to control for and isolate each of the factors that might affect how readers prefer
to resolve pronouns.&apos; These factors include the influence of the other complex sentence
structures in the discourse, and the factors that affect focus computation and pronoun
resolution for simple sentences, i.e., focus history, the syntactic roles of pronouns and
their potential antecedents, verb aspect and tense, and so on.
More importantly, when one is constructing texts without the benefit of a systematic
methodology, one cannot be sure that the collection of constructed texts are represen-
tative of naturally occurring text in terms of the interactive relationships within and
across focusing and semantic factors, and their influence on pronoun interpretation.
As a result, there is a danger of tuning a theory to handle a discourse phenomena that
is the exception rather than the norm in naturally occurring situations.

5. Using a Corpus Analysis to Extend Frameworks
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999925375">
Because of the problems associated with using constructed discourses, it is natural to
turn to some kind of corpus analysis to extend a focusing framework. For example, one
might measure how well an extension of a framework handles a type of complex sen-
tence by measuring how accurately and efficiently it suggests referents for pronouns in
texts that contain the type of complex sentence under consideration. One could count
how often the extended framework suggests a wrong referent (which would not be
rejected by an ideal inferencing mechanism), and how many referents it suggests (on
average) to the inferencing component before the correct referent is selected.
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.9968482">
3 Note, it is possible that various types of complex sentences would each need to be handled differently
by the focusing algorithm.
4 I.e., discourses whose pronouns cannot be unambiguously resolved on the basis of semantic/world-
knowledge factors alone.
5 This need was not addressed by previous focusing work in an adequate or systematic fashion.

Such a corpus analysis has been used to compare pronoun resolution algorithms
that are not based on a focusing framework. For instance, Hobbs (1978) proposes a
simple pronoun resolution algorithm that proposes referents for pronouns that it finds
by walking a parse tree of a sentence (and the previous sentences) in a particular order.
He examined several hundred pronoun occurrences in a variety of texts to show how
well the algorithm was able to identify the correct referent.
Lappin and Leass (1994) developed a pronoun resolution algorithm that chose a
referent for a pronoun from a set of potential referents (which were filtered to assure
their syntactic and morphological appropriateness) on the basis of a &amp;quot;salience factor&amp;quot;
rating. The rating for a potential referent was raised if, for example, it was a subject,
it occurred recently (the algorithm, like Hobbs&apos;s, preferred intrasentential pronouns),
it was a head noun, or it had a parallel grammatical role with the pronoun. This
algorithm was also tested using a corpus analysis (and it was compared to Hobbs&apos;s
algorithm with a corpus analysis as well).
Strube (1998) introduced a novel pronoun resolution algorithm that handled intra-
and intersentential anaphora uniformly. He was able to apply his algorithm to a corpus
and showed that his algorithm outperforms that of Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard
(1987) using the definition of utterance given in Kameyama (1998).
Notice that none of the factors on which the above algorithms were based explicitly
take into account the specific complexity exhibited by a sentence. (For example, there
is no difference in the set of factors for an &amp;quot;SX because SY&amp;quot; sentence as compared to an
&amp;quot;SX although SY&amp;quot; sentence, even though it is possible that the subsequent pronouns
should be resolved differently in the two cases.) In addition, neither Hobbs (1978) nor
Lappin and Leass (1994) tracked focusing information. While Strube (1998) is closer to
a &amp;quot;focusing-based&amp;quot; algorithm, it considers very few of the focusing factors discussed
in the previous section. On the other hand, pronoun resolution algorithms dependent
on the kind of focusing information discussed in the previous section are affected by
complex sentence structures. Thus we must face the challenge of determining how the
focusing algorithm (and pronoun resolution algorithms) should act in the face of the
complexity introduced by a type of complex sentence.
Other researchers have attempted to make use of corpus analyses in focusing
research (though they did not attempt to extend the various algorithms to handle
complex sentences). Walker (1989) performed a corpus analysis on written and spoken
English to compare centering with Hobbs&apos;s algorithm (Hobbs 1976) in terms of their
accuracy and coverage for finding the cospecifiers of pronouns. Walker also performed
a corpus analysis (on spoken English) to investigate how centering should process
a sentence beginning with the word Now, which she assumes (frequently) marks a
new discourse segment (Walker 1993). Linson (1993) analyzed a corpus of spoken
data to investigate focus transition patterns. (Previous work on centering assumed a
particular priority on focus transition possibilities.) However, in each of these analyses,
the researcher did not specify how complex sentences in the corpora were processed
by the centering algorithm. Because the complex sentences may affect the way the
centering data structures should be computed, it is not clear how the reported results
should be interpreted.6
While we believe that corpus analyses are ultimately necessary for evaluating
focusing frameworks, any analysis based solely on a corpus analysis will be faced
with several potential difficulties.
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.9962545">
6 In fact, in some cases, Linson treated a complex sentence as two units for processing, and in others, he
treated a complex sentence as a single unit for processing (Suri 1993).

First, a focusing framework is intended to capture a reader&apos;s preferences for focus
movement and pronoun resolution independent of world knowledge, semantics, and
other pragmatic factors. Very large amounts of text would have to be analyzed to
control the influence of these factors; yet, since there are few tools available for this
type of analysis, this task would be formidable.
Second, a corpus analysis may be useful in comparing various extensions of a
focusing framework, but it is up to the designer to decide which extensions to compare.&apos;
Using a corpus analysis alone, a novel extension cannot emerge by becoming evident
as a side effect of the analysis. Generally speaking, before a corpus analysis can be
used, the researcher must have made all decisions concerning the processing of all
types of sentences occurring in the corpus. These decisions would include:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.982933263157895">
1. Whether and how a complex sentence should be segmented for
processing (for pronoun resolution and focus computation). (Note that
the answer to this might vary for different types of complex sentences.)
2. Whether at a given point in the discourse, the framework should prefer
for the focus to remain the same or for the focus to shift in some
particular manner.
3. What and how linguistic information about the text should affect the
(predictive) pronoun resolution algorithms and updating focusing data
structures.
One might include the following items among this information:
• grammatical roles of elements
• syntactic form of clauses
• the syntactic from of the sentence as a whole
• pronominalization (in the current sentence)
• clue words
• verb aspect and tense
One must also determine how these factors should be taken into account
in the algorithms.
4. How factors discussed in items 2 and 3 interact in pronoun resolution

<bodyText confidence="0.974721933333333">
and in updating focusing information.
The decisions about the matters discussed in the above list would constitute a
(version of a) focusing framework. Thus, when one tries to compare different extended
versions of a focusing framework one is effectively asking how the different sets of
possible decisions about the matters discussed above compare to one another.
To perform a corpus analysis to identify the appropriate extension of a framework
in order to process a particular type of complex sentence, all possible extensions of
the framework (which are to be tested in the corpus analysis) must be completely
identified prior to the corpus analysis. Notice, however, that there is no guarantee that
the correct extension will be specified and tested in the corpus analysis approach. One
might overlook the appropriate answers to how to segment sentences and how to
process a particular kind of complex sentence. In addition, the number of possible

corpus be marked with the referents of all the anaphors, but also all the focusing data structures must
be specified for each sentence. This task faces many of the problems outlined below.

extensions is likely quite large, and thus the number of alternative corpus analyses
will likely be quite prohibitive.
Perhaps the most significant and problematic obstacle for determining how to
extend a focusing framework to handle a particular kind of complex sentence via a
corpus analysis is the following: if one does not know how to process many types
of complex sentences, it is difficult to perform a corpus analysis to determine how
to process a given type of complex sentence, since instances of that type of complex
sentence are likely to be preceded and followed by other types of complex sentences. In
particular, if we are trying to determine how to process a particular type of complex
sentence, and that type of sentence occurs as sentence 5, in a text in a corpus, we
do not want misconceptions about how to process sentence Sn_i or how to process
sentence Sn+1 in the text to mislead us in deciding how to process a complex sentence
like sentence S. Furthermore, many sentences in the corpus are likely to involve
multiple levels of complexity Thus, it is very difficult to isolate the influence of one
complex sentence structure from the influence of another complex sentence structure
when performing a corpus analysis.
In sum, in order to perform a corpus analysis, it is necessary to make many deci-
sions prior to the analysis. On what basis should these decisions be made? There are
many factors that affect focusing and pronoun resolution that need to be studied and
yet there is no way to systematically isolate these factors from each other in naturally
occurring text. Also, one might not easily find a portion of text with an appropriate
combination of features that is needed to test one&apos;s hypothesis. Furthermore, the test-
ing of a hypothesis is likely to require looking at many portions of text with different
combinations of values for focusing factors (e.g., pronominalized subject versus not
pronominalized subject, whether a subject is coreferring with the subject [or some
particular focusing data structure] of the preceding sentence). In addition, in order to
perform a corpus analysis to determine how to extend a focusing framework, one must
make decisions about how to segment and process all kinds of complex sentences that
occur in the corpus. This requires knowing a priori what all of the processing possi-
bilities are, or what all of the possible extensions to the framework are, and it requires
testing all of these possible extensions.
We feel that these difficult problems make it infeasible to determine how to process
complex sentences using a methodology based on a corpus analysis alone. On the other
hand, once a possible extension is identified, verification with a corpus analysis is a
necessary step to be sure that a found extension is appropriate. We discuss how to
perform such a corpus analysis and indicate some specific problems with using a
corpus analysis in the context of this problem in Section 6.5.

6. Our Two-Part Methodology for Determining How to Process Complex Sentences

<bodyText confidence="0.999987545454546">
As we have pointed out, there are several potential problems with analyses using
constructed discourses and with corpus analyses. Our methodology combines specific
instances of both of these methodologies; these specific instances were designed to
overcome the difficulties we identified.
The first part of our methodology involves systematically constructing discourses
(of a type to be described) and gathering acceptability judgments on these discourses.
The discourses are constructed in such a way as to help identify a plausible extension
of a focusing algorithm that would handle the type of complex sentence in question.
The resulting extension must then be confirmed by a corpus analysis to ensure that
the constructed discourses properly represent all influences actually found in naturally
occurring text.

An alternative to the corpus analysis phase is to perform psycholinguistic experi-
ments, such as those of Gordon, Grosz, and Gilliom (1993) and Hudson-D&apos;Zmura and
Tanenhaus (1998), which validate aspects of centering theory by measuring subjects&apos;
reading times of several types of sentences. This is a reasonable approach since, in
those studies, the theory being validated, centering, was already given. In our case,
the second phase is trying to verify a hypothesis suggested by the human subjects&apos;
judgments (collected in less-controlled circumstances) from the first phase. So, either
a new set of test discourses or a new set of human subjects would be needed in or-
der to execute a psycholinguistic experiment. For the sake of simplicity and to avoid
the strict constraints on using human subjects, it is more practical for us to rely on
a corpus analysis in the verification phase. Furthermore, the corpus analysis reveals
how language is actually used in practice, rather than depending on a small set of
discourses presented to the human subjects.

6.1 Semantically Slanted Discourse (SSD) Methodology: The Motivation for the
First Part
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998820227272727">
In previous literature on local focusing (e.g., Sidner 1979; Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein
1983, 1995; Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard 1987), researchers used a small number
of constructed texts to justify aspects of their focusing frameworks and to assess and
compare focusing frameworks. However, they did not explicitly address how one
should construct sets of texts in order to draw accurate conclusions about local fo-
cusing. The first part of our methodology is intended to help the researcher construct
sets of texts (i.e., minimal pairs or minimal quadruples) that allow components of a
focusing framework to be systematically isolated and thus allow one to appropriately
assess focusing frameworks.
To appreciate the reasoning behind the first part of our methodology, or what we
call our Semantically Slanted Discourse (SSD) Methodology, recall that local focusing
frameworks are intended to capture the preferences for pronoun resolution independent
of semantics, world knowledge, rhetorical relations, and other kinds of pragmatics.
Thus, they are intended to capture how one would resolve pronouns and update
focusing information in discourse that is neutral in terms of these factors. Presumably
in such texts, only focusing factors would affect pronoun resolution. In a semantically
nonneutral discourse, semantic factors (semantics, world knowledge, etc.) can override
the preferences of the focusing framework by rejecting potential referents proposed
by a focusing framework.
Taking this into account, in order to determine how best to process a particular
type of complex sentence, we decided to construct discourses that have two important
properties:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.8371">
1. The set of discourses must be systematically constructed to ensure that
each possible combination of focusing factors is represented in a
discourse. Below, we show how this is done for a particular focusing

interpretation based on semantic factors. We call such a discourse
&amp;quot;semantically slanted&amp;quot; because the interpretation of all of the pronouns
is fully determined by the semantic factors alone.
We contend that in a semantically slanted discourse, if the text seems ambiguous
or awkward, or if one needs to reinterpret a pronoun, then the focusing preferences

for pronoun resolution are at odds with the preferences based on semantics, world
knowledge, or other pragmatic factors. On the other hand, if the text seems accept-
able/natural, then we contend that the preferences for pronoun resolution based on fo-
cusing agree with preferences based on semantic slanting. Thus, gathering acceptabil-
ity judgments about these systematically constructed semantically slanted discourses
should help us identify what the focusing preferences are, and thus how a focusing
framework should be extended to handle a given type of complex sentence. This is
the idea at the heart of our methodology.

into consideration by the focusing algorithm, should &amp;quot;behave&amp;quot; in the
face of the complexity under study
The first of these issues influences the overall form of the discourses being con-
structed. The second requires systematically constructing a number of discourses that
alter the various focusing factors in such a way as to isolate their potential influence.
In order to isolate the complexity under study, we construct a set of discourses of
the following form, for which the interpretation of the NPs is fully determined by the
semantics of the text and world knowledge:

types of discourses our methodology calls for constructing, let us consider what would
be needed to extend a particular focusing framework, RAFT/ RAPR (described in Suri
[1993]), to handle resolving subject pronouns in sentences of the form &amp;quot;SX because
SY&amp;quot; where SX and SY are simple sentences, and in a sentence following that type of
sentence.&apos;
But, first, let us briefly introduce some facts about the RAFT! RAPR algorithm.
RAFT /RAPR defines a data structure called the Subject Focus, abbreviated SF, which,
for a simple sentence, is taken to be the subject. The algorithm prefers to resolve a
subject pronoun (in a simple sentence) so that it corefers with the contents of the
Subject Focus of the previous sentence. When processing a simple sentence, if the
suggested referent for a subject (i.e., the previous sentence&apos;s Subject Focus) is rejected
by inferencing with world knowledge, semantics, and pragmatics, then other elements
in the previous discourse are tried in a specified order; this ordering is (indirectly)
influenced by such things as whether a pronoun was used in the previous sentence
(since pronouns are indicative of focus and therefore influence the computation of
focusing data structures for the previous sentence). Notice that the algorithm prefers
constancy in Subject Focus over shifting the Subject Focus.&apos;
To address the question of how to process &amp;quot;SX because SY&amp;quot; sentences, we examined
discourses of the form:
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.306123666666667">
Example 2
(Si) simple sentence
(S2) SX because SY
(S3) simple sentence
The set of constructed discourses were &amp;quot;variations&amp;quot; of the form shown in Example 3.

(51) Dodge was nearly robbed by an ex-convict the other night.

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999282857142857">
Notice in this example that SX = &amp;quot;[Dodge] captured [the ex-con]&amp;quot; and SY = &amp;quot;[the
ex-con] was so stupid and clumsy&amp;quot;. We constructed variations of this text to tease
out how the various focusing factors interact when processing an &amp;quot;SX because SY&amp;quot;
sentence or a simple sentence following an &amp;quot;SX because SY&amp;quot; sentence. The constructed
variations of the text (described below) changed the form and referents of the text in
square brackets &amp;quot;[ ]&amp;quot;. In order to keep the semantic slanting appropriate, these changes
caused the content of the text to be changed as well.

<footnote confidence="0.504821666666667">
8 Throughout the paper, except in Section 6.5, we use &amp;quot;SX&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;SY&amp;quot; to denote simple sentences or
simple clauses.
9 The centering algorithm prefers for the center to remain the same rather than to change, and it also
prefers for the center to be the subject of the sentence. In general, focusing algorithms have a
preference for focus/foci to remain the same rather than to change; this preference seems consistent
with the goal for text to be coherent.

Some questions that must be answered in coming up with an extension of RAFT/
RAPR for handling &amp;quot;SX because SY&amp;quot; sentences are:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999963133333333">
1. If the Subject(SY) is a pronoun, how should Subject(SY) be resolved?
Recall that RAFT/RAPR would prefer a subject pronoun to corefer with
the subject of the previous sentence. In the face of this complexity
should the algorithm prefer that the Subject(SY) corefer with Subject(S1)
or with Subject(SX)?
2. How should Subject(S3) be resolved? I.e.,
• Preferring Subject(SX) always? (This would suggest that
RAFT! RAPR should compute the Subject Focus of the &amp;quot;SX
because SY&amp;quot; sentence to be Subject(SX).)
• Preferring Subject(SY) always?
• Preferring Subject(SX) or Subject(SY) depending on which is
pronominalized?
• Preferring Subject(SX) or Subject(SY) depending on which is
coreferential with Subject(S1)?
• Based on some other preference?
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999833571428571">
The answers to these (and all such similar questions) constitute a decision about
how and whether the complex sentence should be segmented, and how to weigh the
influences of the various focusing factors such as pronominalization and focus history
in resolving pronouns and in updating the focusing data structures.
To see how we make up the discourse variations to cover all processing possibili-
ties, consider this abstract view of the text, which indicates the NPs we are interested
in:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.8337846">

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9566756">
To find an extension of the focusing algorithm, we need to construct text variations
that capture all the different ways the grammatical roles, focus history, and pronomi-
nalization (i.e., the focusing factors) might interact in determining the referent of the
pronoun in Subject(S3).1° We construct text variations corresponding to variations of
the following parameters:

1. Whether Subject(S1) is the ex-convict or Dodge. (&amp;quot;An ex-convict nearly

<footnote confidence="0.976586571428571">
10 It is crucial that we keep the form of the complex sentence constant (i.e., &amp;quot;SX because SY&amp;quot;) but
manipulate the text so that the focusing data structures before processing S2 take on all possible
values. This allows us to identify how these data structures should influence pronoun resolution within
S2 and S3.
11 Passive sentences are handled by most focusing algorithms; however, see Section 6.4.1 for a discussion
of why the choice between active and passive voice could not account for the findings of the
experiment.

Subject(S1)=Subject(SX).

SX is more important in resolving pronouns in SY.

neither (e.g., Subject(S3)=Direct-Object(SY)).13

NPs in S2 affect the resolution of the pronoun in S3.

The result of this procedure is a set of texts that can be presented to native speak-
ers for judgments. The idea is that in texts that are judged to be acceptable, the reader
sees no conflicts, so the focusing factors (grammatical role, pronoun history, and focus
history) must agree with the semantic slanting. In texts that are judged unaccept-
able or ambiguous, there must be a conflict between these two sets of factors. Thus,
gathering such judgments should identify how focusing factors and semantic factors
influence how readers interpret pronouns, and on the basis of this information from
the judgments, a possible extension of the focusing algorithm can be identified.

6.4 Finding an Extension Based on Judgments
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9728649">
To see how this methodology can be used to find an extension for a focusing frame-
work, let us concentrate on determining how RAFT / RAPR should compute the fo-
cusing data structures for an &amp;quot;SX because SY&amp;quot; sentence in order to correctly resolve a
subject pronoun in a simple sentence following an &amp;quot;SX because SY&amp;quot; sentence. In con-
sidering this question, recall that RAFT / RAPR prefers to resolve a subject pronoun in
a simple sentence with the Subject Focus of the previous sentence. Thus, the specific
question we need to address is how to compute the Subject Focus of an &amp;quot;SX because
SY&amp;quot; sentence.&apos;
Again, the factors that might determine how to compute the subject focus of a
sentence are:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9964718">
1. Syntactic form. For example, perhaps the Subject Focus should be
computed as Subject(SX) (or, alternately, Subject(SY)), regardless of other
factors. This would be appropriate if readers prefer to resolve the subject
of the subsequent sentence so that it cospecifies Subject(SX) (or,
alternately Subject(SY)), regardless of other focusing factors.
2. Pronominalization. For example, perhaps the Subject Focus should be
computed as Subject(SX) or as Subject(SY) depending on which is
pronominalized, regardless of other factors (unless both or neither are
pronominalized). This would be appropriate if readers prefer to resolve
the subject of the subsequent sentence on the basis of whether
Subject(SX) or the Subject(SY) was pronominalized.
3. Focus history. For example, perhaps Subject Focus should be computed
as Subject(SX) or Subject(SY) depending on which cospecified the Subject
Focus of the sentence preceding the &amp;quot;SX because SY&amp;quot; sentence. This
would be appropriate if readers prefer to resolve the subject of the
sentence following the &amp;quot;SX because SY&amp;quot; sentence so it cospecifies the
Subject Focus of the sentence preceding the &amp;quot;SX because SY&amp;quot; sentence.
4. Perhaps the interaction of two or more of the above factors (syntactic
form, pronominalization, and focusing history) might influence how the
Subject Focus should be computed.

the underlying question for each framework is one of how the data structures should be computed for
an &amp;quot;SX because SY&amp;quot; sentence so that the referent of the subject in a (immediately) subsequent simple
sentence can be computed in an efficient manner that is consistent with the processing of other simple
sentences and other sentences that the framework can already handle.

two other people. This pilot group seemed to be primarily influenced by the syn-
tactic form of the sentences. In particular, their responses indicated a preference for
the subject focus of the &amp;quot;SX because SY&amp;quot; sentence to be the subject of SX. Because
asking subjects for judgments on such a large set of discourses was prohibitive, we
reduced the number of discourses to 13, including four that would critically examine
the hypothesis that the influence of syntactic form dominated the preferences. The
discussion below explains why the selected discourses test this hypothesis. The four
crucial discourses were distributed randomly throughout the test set.
Fifty-one participants were asked to judge the sentences as acceptable, awkward,
or ambiguous. (In some cases, a participant did not judge one of the discourses, so
there are instances with less than 51 judgments.) The participants selected were native
speakers of English working in linguistics or computational linguistics.
Suri (1993) performed a critical analysis of the experiment that explained why
other factors such as the infrequency of indefinite subjects in naturally occurring dis-
course, the use of passive or active voice, certain lexical choices, (potentially) stronger
reader identification with a victim / near-victim (or with a criminal), and order of text
presentation could not explain the distribution of judgments in our experiment. For
example, one may suspect that the use of the passive as in Si of both Example 5 and
Example 6 may influence the judgments given. However, the experiment contained
pairs of examples where passive sentences were used for Si and one was judged ac-
ceptable and the other unacceptable by the participants. Similar. pairs of examples with
Si in active voice were included with the same results. Thus it must be the case that
the judgments given were attributable to some factor other than active! passive voice.
Similar argumentation can be used to explain why the other factors did not influence
the judgments as well.
In the results reported below, judgments of &amp;quot;awkward&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;ambiguous&amp;quot; are
both considered to be &amp;quot;unacceptable.&amp;quot; Since we want to derive an extension based
on what usages are acceptable, the distinction between awkward and ambiguous is
not relevant, since neither is acceptable. Table 1 contains the results of the four crucial
discourses contained in our experiment. In the table, the column labeled Consensus
indicates whether the majority of the participants judged the discourse acceptable or
unacceptable. The final column tells the statistical significance of this consensus, as
computed by a x-square test. This test is computed separately for each discourse. In
order to compute x-square, we must define the expected distribution of responses over
the categories. To get this, first, the overall distribution of the three categories can be
computed by summing the number of occurrences of each over the four discourses.
As can be seen from Table 1 (by summing each judgment column), roughly half the
judgments were &amp;quot;acceptable,&amp;quot; a third were &amp;quot;awkward,&amp;quot; and a sixth were &amp;quot;ambiguous.&amp;quot;
These ratios can be used to define the expected value for each of the discourses. For
example, in Discourse 2, there were 50 responses. So, the expected number (according
to the overall distribution) of &amp;quot;acceptable&amp;quot; responses is about half the number of
responses, or 25. Using these expected frequencies, x-square is then computed.&apos;
For each discourse, a significant (p &lt; .001) distribution of categories was demon-
strated. As is shown in Table 1, the group judged each discourse to be acceptable or
unacceptable with a high degree of significance. This indicates that the distribution of
judgments is very different from the random distribution that would result if partici-
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.9890835">
15 An alternative method of computing expected frequencies is to make no suppositions regarding the
three categories; that is, the expected frequency for each of the three categories is simply one third of
the number of judgments for that discourse. With this method, the results are unchanged for three of
the discourses, and Discourse 4 is significant at the .05 level.

6.4.2 Results of Collecting SSD Judgments. Our findings indicate that the syntactic
form alone seems to most greatly influence what should be chosen as the Subject Focus
of an &amp;quot;SX because SY&amp;quot; sentence (Suri 1993; Suri and McCoy 1993). In particular, we
found that readers prefer to resolve the subject of a sentence following an &amp;quot;SX because
SY&amp;quot; sentence so that the subject cospecifies Subject(SX), regardless of other focusing
factors. We will refer to this finding as the Prefer-SX Hypothesis. This hypothesis
indicates that RAFT / RAPR should be extended so that it computes the Subject Focus
of an &amp;quot;SX because SY&amp;quot; sentence as Subject(SX). Consider how the judged discourses
in Examples 5 and 6 support this conclusion.
</bodyText>

(Si) Dodge was robbed by an ex-convict the other night.
(S2) The ex-convict tied him up because he wasn&apos;t cooperating.
(S3) Then he took all the money and ran.
Notice that in the discourse in Example 5 the semantic slanting should lead to the
interpretation of S3 as &amp;quot;Then [the ex-convict] took all the money and ran.&amp;quot; Thus, in
this text, the semantic slanting favors resolving Subject(S3) as Subject(SX), and thus it
would favor computing the Subject Focus of S2 to be Subject(SX). However, notice that
the other focusing factors in the text all favor the Subject(SY) (i.e., Dodge) to be the
subject focus of the complex clause. For instance, pronominalization favors computing
the Subject Focus of S2 (which will be used to resolve Subject(S3)) to be Subject(SY)
since Subject(SY) is pronominalized in S2, but Subject(SX) is not. The focus history
would also favor the reading in which Subject(S3) is Dodge (i.e., corefers with the
Subject(SY)) since Dodge was the Subject Focus of Si and Dodge occurs in S2 as a
subject.
Even though only the factor of syntactic form favors the interpretation that agrees
with semantic slanting, of the 51 subjects in our experiment, 92% judged this discourse
as acceptable. This supports the hypothesis that the syntax is the most important
focusing factor and that it favors resolving a subject in a simple sentence following an
&amp;quot;SX because SY&amp;quot; sentence so that the subject cospecifies Subject(SX).
The above hypothesis is further supported by the judgments given on a second
discourse:

<bodyText confidence="0.972988777777778">
In Example 6, one would expect subjects to judge the discourse to be &amp;quot;awkward&amp;quot;
or &amp;quot;ambiguous&amp;quot; if the syntax factor overrides other focusing factors and causes Sub-
ject(SX) to be the preferred referent for the subject of the subsequent sentence. This is
because the semantic slanting should lead to the interpretation of S3 as &amp;quot;Then [Dodge]
started screaming for help,&amp;quot; i.e., an interpretation for which Subject(S3)Subject(SX).
In fact, most subjects (82%), did judge the discourse as awkward or ambiguous. As
a result, we have labeled (S3) with a &amp;quot;#&amp;quot;, which traditionally denotes pragmatic ill-
formedness.
To reiterate, in Example 6:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.99828875">
• On the basis of semantic slanting, Subject(S3)=Subject(SY) and
Subject(S3)Subject(SX).
• Subject Focus history would favor Subject(SY) for the Subject Focus of S2
since Subject(SY)=Subject(S1) (i.e., the Subject Focus of Si).
• Pronominalization would favor Subject(SY) for the Subject Focus of S2
since the referent of Subject(SY) is pronominalized in S2, but Subject(SX)
is not.
• The discourse was judged &amp;quot;awkward&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;ambiguous.&amp;quot;
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998211538461538">
Contrast this with Example 5 where the focus history and pronominalization favor
computing the Subject Focus of S2 to be Subject(SY), the semantic slanting indicates
Subject(S3) is Subject(SX), and the text was judged &amp;quot;acceptable.&amp;quot;
Taken together, these judgments suggest that the reader prefers to resolve Sub-
ject(S3) with Subject(SX) regardless of the other focusing factors since this would ex-
plain the judgments as follows: In Example 6, the interpretation of Subject(S3) indicated
by this focusing preference would be at odds with the interpretation forced by the se-
mantic slanting and the text was judged awkward; in Example 5, the interpretation
indicated by this focusing preference would agree with the interpretation forced by
the semantic slanting and the text was judged acceptable.
The appropriateness of this conclusion should be verified through a corpus anal-
ysis. We discuss how such analyses should be performed in Section 6.5, and present
preliminary results of such an analysis.

to see how well the Prefer-SX hypothesis (proposed on the basis of the Semantically
Slanted Discourses experiment described above) predicted the correct referents of pro-
nouns in a sentence following a sentence of the form &amp;quot;SX because SY.&amp;quot;
In the corpus analysis described below, we did not restrict our study of the corpus
to cases where SX and SY were each a single clause, and thus for the discussion in
this section, Section 6.5, SX does not necessarily denote a single clause, and likewise
for SY. We chose to consider cases where SX or SY was not a single clause because
the number of candidates of the appropriate form was quite small and we did not
want to further limit the number of sentences that we could include in this corpus
analysis. For each example in the corpus, one author coded the discourse, identifying
the referents of the subject of SX, subject of SY, and subject of S3, and another author

We concentrated our analysis on studying the resolution of a subject in a sentence
following a sentence of the form &amp;quot;SX because SY.&amp;quot; We analyzed 81 text sequences
where each text sequence contained an &amp;quot;SX because SY&amp;quot; sentence, S„ followed by
another sentence, S„+1, which had one or more subjects that was! were coreferential
with at least one subject in S„ We were interested in which subject element(s) in the
&amp;quot;SX because SY&amp;quot; sentence was/were being referred to by the subject(s) in the S„pi
sentence. From this analysis, we created three tables that captured the coreference
relationships that we were interested in. We looked at how often a subject in Sn±i
cospecified a subject of SX but not a subject of SY (and whether or not it occurred
as a pronoun in Sn+i); this data is shown in Table 2. We also looked at how often a
subject in S„Fi cospecified a subject of SY but not a subject of SX (and whether or not
it occurred as a pronoun in Sn+i); this data is shown in Table 3. Finally, we looked
at how often a subject in Sn+i cospecified a subject of SX and a subject of SY (and
whether or not it occurred as a pronoun in Sn+i); this data is shown in Table 4.
We make the following comments:

• The information in Tables 2 to 4 is based on an analysis of 81 sentences
(from the selected corpora) involving an &amp;quot;SX because SY&amp;quot; structure. We
initially extracted more of such sentences from the corpora. We did not
analyze some of these sentences because they involved biblical writing
(and thus a very different style of writing), and we did not analyze
others because they could not be classified in a straightforward fashion
(because they involved multiple levels of complexity or raised too many
questions about how to code the sentence, etc.). Thus, this analysis is
based on 81 sentences.

cospecified an Sn+1 element that was prior to the NP in 5n+1. Thus, the
interpretation of the NP might be based on the Sn+i element, rather than

Sn+i element cospecified an 5, element.

• A subject in Si was more significantly more likely (34 times versus 19
times, X2 = 4.24, p &lt; .05) to cospecify only an SX subject than to
cospecify only an SY subject. This suggests that a subject in SX (for an
&amp;quot;SX because SY&amp;quot; sentence) is more likely to be a subject of a subsequent
sentence than a subject in SY.
• A pronominal subject in Sn+1 was significantly more likely (29 times

to cospecify only an SY subject. This suggests that a pronominal subject
in a sentence following an &amp;quot;SX because SY&amp;quot; sentence is more likely to
cospecify the SX subject rather than the SY subject.

6.6 Implications for Proposed Extension

<bodyText confidence="0.999993454545455">
As noted above in Section 6.4, the Prefer-SX Hypothesis would indicate that RAFT/
RAPR should be extended so that it computes the Subject Focus of an &amp;quot;SX because
SY&amp;quot; sentence as Subject(SX). Since this corpus analysis did not appear to contradict the
hypothesis, it also did not appear to contradict the appropriateness of the proposed
extension. We point this out to clarify how a corpus analysis can be used to confirm
proposed extensions, as well as confirming hypothesis about readers&apos; preferences for
pronoun interpretation.
Also, we stress that the SSD Methodology and the hypothesis generated by ap-
plications of the methodology have implications for extending other focusing frame-
works, not just RAFT! RAPR. (See Sufi [1993] or Suri and McCoy [1994] for a discus-

since it entails that applications of the SSD Methodology have general implications
for focusing research, not just for extending the RAFT/ RAPR framework.

7. Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999964096774194">
The SSD methodology must be employed in order to derive extensions to each frame-
work for every kind of complex sentence. For example, sentences of the form &amp;quot;Because
SX, SY&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;SX although SY&amp;quot; may have different extensions, and therefore will have
to be examined separately under this methodology. However, we would like to be able
to predict the extension suggested by the first (SSD construction) part of the method-
ology. One way to arrive at these predictions is to use a feature-based hierarchy of
the connectives that appear in the complex sentences, as in Knott and Mellish [1996].
Then, if we have already found the proper extension for one complexity, say &amp;quot;SX
because SY&amp;quot; sentences, we may predict that any connective that is synonymous (in
terms of features) with because will have the same extension (provided the connective
is used in a syntactically analagous sentence structure). Thus, we have bypassed the
first part of the methodology. The second step of verifying the extension through a
corpus analysis will still have to be performed. If this extension cannot be verified,
then the first step will have to be done anyway.
Sun&apos;s (1993) critical analysis suggested the need to use the SSD Methodology to
test the role of then and aspect in the interpretation of pronouns in the SSD experiment.&apos;
We stress that (because of the all the problems associated with corpus analyses that
have been discussed in this paper) there is no clear way to test the influence of then,
the duration of events, or aspect using only a corpus analysis.
As explained in Sufi (1993), our claim that aspectual classification might play a
role in the interpretation of pronouns in a subsequent sentence is distinct from the
hypotheses of other researchers about the role of tense and aspect (e.g., Nakhimovsky
1988; Reichman 1978) in pronoun interpretation. In short, we believe Reichman (1978)
only intended that tense and aspect could signal discourse segment boundaries, and
thus indirectly influence pronoun interpretation, while Nalchimovsky (1988) claims
that a change in time scale, aspectual class, or other temporal characteristics could
signal a new discourse segment, and thus, indirectly influence pronoun interpretation.
We propose that aspectual classification might affect pronoun interpretation within a
discourse segment (Suri 1993).
Suri also reviewed literature on NP1-biased and NP2-biased verbs (see Caramazza
et al. [1977] or Sufi [1993]) and the implications of this work for future analyses.

8. Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999918285714286">
The notion of local focusing and its influence on pronoun resolution has been found
useful in many aspects of NLP. However, previous work on local focusing has ignored
complex sentences even though they are prevalent in naturally occurring text. The
problem that we faced was one of determining a reasonable way to extend a focusing
algorithm to handle these sentences. Previous methodology (i.e., using semantically
neutral text) was too simplistic and nearly impossible to utilize. A solely corpus-based
analysis was impossible because of the variety of a priori decisions that needed to be

made and because of the complexity of interaction among factors in naturally occurring
discourses. This work presents a methodology that calls for the systematic construction
of texts. It relies on the potential tension of semantic factors with focusing factors to
identify possible extensions of a focusing framework to account for a particular kind
of complex sentence. The methodology has been used to extend a focusing framework
(RAFT/ RAPR) to handle one type of complex sentence (&amp;quot;SX because SY&amp;quot; sentences).
We illustrated the SSD Methodology by 1) explaining how the first part of the
methodology led to the Prefer-SX hypothesis (a hypothesis about how readers pre-
fer to resolve subjects in a sentence following an &amp;quot;SX because SY&amp;quot; sentence); and
2) discussing a (scaled-down) preliminary corpus analysis we performed to test the
validity of the Prefer-SX hypothesis. We relaxed the methodology for the purposes of
the preliminary corpus analysis because of the enormous amount of work required
to perform the corpus analysis properly and because we felt that the corpus analysis
would reveal more issues to be addressed prior to a proper corpus analysis. As re-
ported in this paper, the corpus analysis did not refute our Prefer-SX hypothesis, and
it did indeed reveal more issues that need to be addressed in this type, or any other
type, of corpus analysis to examine focusing methodologies.
Note that one very important point raised by the preliminary corpus analysis is
that the numbers derived during a corpus analysis are prone to represent not just the
influence of the focusing framework, but the influence of world knowledge, semantics,
and other pragmatic factors. Therefore, corpus analyses must be considered with this
in mind. Because the problems that arose during our preliminary corpus analysis
will arise during any kind of corpus analysis, we believe that our SSD Methodology is
important for deciding how to extend a given focusing framework, and for comparing
two focusing frameworks.
In fact, we feel that a corpus analysis to verify findings based on the SSD Method-
ology should be withheld until the processing of many kinds of complex sentences
using the SSD Methodology has been analyzed. It would be better still to have an
inference tool with which to reject referents based on semantics, world knowledge,
pragmatics, etc. This would allow us to apply focusing algorithms to a corpus and
automate the comparison of focusing algorithms, by adding functions to track and
compute the frequency information (like the frequency information shown in Tables 2
to 4) that is needed for a corpus analysis.
The reader should note that the preferences for pronoun resolution that we iden-
tified (i.e., the Prefer-SX Hypothesis) refute an assumption sometimes made by re-
searchers regarding complex sentences: that the clauses of complex sentences can be
processed in a strictly linear order. Our findings indicate that the appropriate contents
of the focusing data structures after processing S2 should be much more heavily influ-
enced by the SX clause (and not by the SY clause, as the previous assumption would
require). We stress that these findings are relevant for other focusing frameworks, not
just RAFT /RAPR, and they indicate the importance of studying complex sentences.
Furthermore, as explained in detail in Suri (1993), the SSD Methodology can also
be used to compare local focusing frameworks. Thus, this methodology allows the
study of focusing phenomena and algorithms related to focusing phenomena.

Previous focusing research has not adequately addressed the processing of complex sentences. We discuss issues involved in processing complex sentences and review a methodology used by other researchers to develop their focusing frameworks. We identify difficulties with that methodology and difficulties with using a corpus analysis to extend focusing frameworks to handle complex sentences. We introduce a new methodology for extending focusing frameworks, which involves two steps. In the first step, a set of systematically constructed texts are used to identify an extension of the focusing framework to handle a particular kind of complex sentence. In the second step, a corpus analysis is used to confirm the extension. We explain how our methodology overcomes the difficulties faced by other approaches.</abstract>

What is Local Focusing? We use the term &amp;quot;local focusing framework&amp;quot; to refer to a theory or framework consisting of a (set of) focus tracking algorithm(s) and a (set of) pronoun resolution algorithm(s). A local focusing framework records and makes use of information about focusing factors and indicates how these factors influence (intersentential) pronoun resolution. Generally, focusing factors include such things as: 1. Grammatical role. In several focusing frameworks (Sidner 1979; Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein 1983, 1995), some grammatical roles (e.g., surface subject and surface direct object) are considered indicative of what is in focus. Also, a pronoun resolution algorithm might prefer to find an antecedent from a previous sentence that has the same grammatical role as a pronoun in the current sentence. 2. Pronoun use. Most, if not all, focusing frameworks are constructed on the basis of the belief that pronominalization is often indicative of focus.

However, they did not explicitly address how one should construct sets of texts in order to draw accurate conclusions about local focusing.

[1986], and Dahl and Ball [1990]) did not explicitly and/or adequately address how to process complex sentences. Thus, there is a need to extend focusing algorithms. An exception to this rule is the work of Strube (1996) (which applies functionalinformation-structure-based criteria on a per-clause basis), Kameyama (1998), and Strube (1998). Kameyama&apos;s focus was on intrasentential anaphora and she attempted to define an &amp;quot;utterance&amp;quot; in the face of syntactic complexity. Strube, in very recent work (Strube 1998), handles arbitrary sentence complexity. Still, neither considers how particular types of complexity might affect a broad range of focusing factors. Notice that there are a number of ways that a given type of complex sentence might be handled by a focusing algorithm. For instance, consider processing a complex sentence of the form &amp;quot;SX because SY,&amp;quot; where SX and SY each consist of a single clause. One might imagine processing </context>

The rating for a potential referent was raised if, for example, it was a subject, it occurred recently (the algorithm, like Hobbs&apos;s, preferred intrasentential pronouns), it was a head noun, or it had a parallel grammatical role with the pronoun. This algorithm was also tested using a corpus analysis (and it was compared to Hobbs&apos;s algorithm with a corpus analysis as well). Strube (1998) introduced a novel pronoun resolution algorithm that handled intraand intersentential anaphora uniformly. He was able to apply his algorithm to a corpus and showed that his algorithm outperforms that of Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard (1987) using the definition of utterance given in Kameyama (1998). Notice that none of the factors on which the above algorithms were based explicitly take into account the specific complexity exhibited by a sentence.

Because the complex sentences may affect the way the centering data structures should be computed, it is not clear how the reported results should be interpreted.6 While we believe that corpus analyses are ultimately necessary for evaluating focusing frameworks, any analysis based solely on a corpus analysis will be faced with several potential difficulties. 6 In fact, in some cases, Linson treated a complex sentence as two units for processing, and in others, he treated a complex sentence as a single unit for processing (Suri 1993). 177 Computational Linguistics Volume 25, Number 2 First, a focusing framework is intended to capture a reader&apos;s preferences for focus movement and pronoun resolution independent of world knowledge, semantics, and other pragmatic factors. Very large amounts of text would have to be analyzed to control the influence of these factors; yet, since there are few tools available for this type of analysis, this task would be formidable. Second, a corpus analysis may be useful in comparing various extensions of a focusing framework, but it is up to the designer to decide which extensions to compare.&apos;</context>

The discussion below explains why the selected discourses test this hypothesis. The four crucial discourses were distributed randomly throughout the test set. Fifty-one participants were asked to judge the sentences as acceptable, awkward, or ambiguous. (In some cases, a participant did not judge one of the discourses, so there are instances with less than 51 judgments.) The participants selected were native speakers of English working in linguistics or computational linguistics. Suri (1993) performed a critical analysis of the experiment that explained why other factors such as the infrequency of indefinite subjects in naturally occurring discourse, the use of passive or active voice, certain lexical choices, (potentially) stronger reader identification with a victim / near-victim (or with a criminal), and order of text presentation could not explain the distribution of judgments in our experiment. For example, one may suspect that the use of the passive as in Si of both Example 5 and Example 6 may influence the judgments given. However, the experiment contained pairs of example</context>

In short, we believe Reichman (1978) only intended that tense and aspect could signal discourse segment boundaries, and thus indirectly influence pronoun interpretation, while Nalchimovsky (1988) claims that a change in time scale, aspectual class, or other temporal characteristics could signal a new discourse segment, and thus, indirectly influence pronoun interpretation. We propose that aspectual classification might affect pronoun interpretation within a discourse segment (Suri 1993). Suri also reviewed literature on NP1-biased and NP2-biased verbs (see Caramazza et al. [1977] or Sufi [1993]) and the implications of this work for future analyses. 8. Conclusions The notion of local focusing and its influence on pronoun resolution has been found useful in many aspects of NLP. However, previous work on local focusing has ignored complex sentences even though they are prevalent in naturally occurring text. The problem that we faced was one of determining a reasonable way to extend a focusing algorithm to handle these sentences. Previous methodology (i.e., using semantically n</context>

Our findings indicate that the appropriate contents of the focusing data structures after processing S2 should be much more heavily influenced by the SX clause (and not by the SY clause, as the previous assumption would require). We stress that these findings are relevant for other focusing frameworks, not just RAFT /RAPR, and they indicate the importance of studying complex sentences. Furthermore, as explained in detail in Suri (1993), the SSD Methodology can also be used to compare local focusing frameworks. Thus, this methodology allows the study of focusing phenomena and algorithms related to focusing phenomena. Acknowledgments References We thank Jeff Lidz, John Hughes, and the Brennan, Susan E. 1998.

Other researchers have attempted to make use of corpus analyses in focusing research (though they did not attempt to extend the various algorithms to handle complex sentences).
