1. Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999651714285714">
The truth-conditional approach to semantics is based on the assumption that con-
veying information about the world is a central part of what language is about, and
therefore the judgments of human subjects as to whether sentences are true or false of
a given situation are a fundamental source of empirical data about the meaning of nat-
ural language sentences. This approach has proved remarkably successful: speakers&apos;
intuitions about the truth conditions of sentences have given us the closest approxi-
mation(s) to a mathematical theory of sentence meaning we have at the moment. Yet
many find the assumption on which truth-conditional semantics rests controversial.
Perhaps the most serious among the reasons for skepticism is that humans find it
difficult, if not impossible, to assess the truth or falsity of statements as simple as Kim
is tall or Robin is blond. Vague statements such as these are well within the scope of
semantics, even when intended narrowly; thus if humans cannot assign them a clear
truth value even when all contextual factors have been resolved, then perhaps truth
conditions are not a solid enough foundation for semantics, after all.
Manfred Pinkal&apos;s Logic and Lexicon, a revised translation of his Logik und Lexikon
(Pinkal 1985), is the most comprehensive argument to date in favor of the position
that the meaning of vague statements can in fact be expressed in truth-conditional
terms. Pinkal also provides in his book a theory of ambiguity, a property of natural
language utterances that is the source of endless trouble for computational linguists.
Ambiguity—syntactic ambiguity and lexical ambiguity in particular—is a central con-
cern both in computational linguistics and in psycholinguistics, but hasn&apos;t been a
central area of research in linguistics, and in particular not in formal semantics. How-
ever, the interest in theories of semantic-ambiguity processing has been raised in recent
years by the development of theories of semantic interpretation based on underspeci-
fication (Alshawi and Crouch 1992; Reyle 1993; Poesio 1995; van Deemter and Peters
1995) as well as by work on the lexicon (Copestake and Briscoe 1995 and Saint-Dizier
and Viegas 1995 for example). Pinkal&apos;s proposals concerning ambiguity will be of great
interest to those working in these areas.

2. The content of the book
Logic and Lexicon consists of three parts. The first part does not require much prior tech-
nical knowledge, and is recommended to those readers who have no formal propen-
sities or only want to learn about Pinkal&apos;s main ideas. The range of phenomena to
be discussed in the book is outlined in chapter 1. A gentle introduction to logical
semantics (chapter 2) is followed in chapter 3 by a presentation of the idea of precisifi-
cation, which is central to Pinkal&apos;s approach to vagueness and ambiguity Next comes
an informal, but very thorough, discussion of his theory of ambiguity vagueness, and
related topics such as polysemy and homonymy in chapter 4. In these chapters Pinkal
puts forward the second main idea of the book, namely, that ambiguity and vagueness,
though distinct phenomena, are both aspects of a more general phenomenon that he
calls indefiniteness, and have a common model-theoretic foundation in the notion of
precisification.
The second and third parts of the book are more technical. The second part con-
sists of two chapters. In chapter 5, Pinkal discusses various ways of formalizing the
notion of indefiniteness, including well-known proposals based on various forms of
three-valued logics and on fuzzy logics, and he argues for an approach based on the
supervaluation technique developed by van Fraassen (see, for example, van Fraassen
1969). In chapter 6, Pinkal&apos;s Precisification Logic is presented in detail; in particular,
the two operators in all respects and in some respects are defined. These operators are
used to formalize the theory of indefiniteness presented in chapter 4.
In the third part of the book, Pinkal reconsiders his treatment of vagueness in
the light of problems raised by measure statements such as John is 1.80 meters tall and
especially by the so-called sorites paradox, or the paradox of the heap. The result is a
reformulation of the notion of precisification in terms of context-change.
The book is essentially free of typographical errors, except for a number of incor-
rect references to page numbers: the reference to page 129 on page 139 should really
be a reference to page 127, the reference to page 128 on page 157 should really be a
reference to page 123, and so forth.

3. Main ideas
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999655888888889">
Logic and Lexicon is a long and dense book; only the main points can be summarized
here. Pinkal&apos;s main idea is that indefiniteness—of which both ambiguity and vagueness
are special cases—occurs because natural language statements are rarely completely
precise. Pinkal&apos;s example is the assertion The Santa Maria was a fast ship. Is this statement
true or false? It depends: if we are comparing the Santa Maria to modern ships, then
the statement is probably false. If instead we are comparing it with the ships of its
time, then perhaps the statement is true, although again it depends on what we mean
by fast. According to Pinkal, the existence of such alternative &amp;quot;ways of making the
sentence precise&amp;quot; is what makes it indefinite; and he argues that both the ambiguity
of a noun like bank and the vagueness of an adjective like fast reflect the existence of
alternative precisifications. What distinguishes ambiguity from vagueness is, according
to Pinkal, whether the precisification spectrum—the range of available precisifications of
an expression—is discrete or continuous: in the first case, we have ambiguity, in the
second, vagueness. Pinkal intentionally leaves open the possibility of borderline cases,
which cannot be properly classified as either ambiguous or vague.
Having motivated the precisification approach to indefiniteness in chapters 3 and
4 on intuitive grounds, Pinkal&apos;s next step is to present in the next two chapters an
argument for the approach on logical grounds. Building on work by Fine (1975) and

Kamp (1975, 1981a), Pinkal demonstrates how the notion of precisification can be im-
plemented by revising the supervaluation technique,1 and how this formulation leads
to a logic—Precisification Logic—that not only allows him to formalize the distinctions
introduced in Chapter 4, but is &amp;quot;conservative,&amp;quot; by which he means that all the classical
tautologies and entailment relations are retained. On the contrary, formalizations of
indefiniteness that rely on the introduction of a third value either result in the loss
of tautologies that one would want to preserve, or achieve conservativity at the ex-
pense of very unintuitive definitions of the truth conditions of the basic connectives.
Perhaps the most surprising among Pinkal&apos;s claims is that natural language is not
truth-functional, by which he means that the value assigned to an expression does not
depend only on the values assigned to its subexpressions. Pinkal contrasts statements
such as John is either tall or not tall, which intuitively seem to be true even if the state-
ment John is tall is indefinite, with statements such as John is tall or blond, to which we
want to accord the status of &amp;quot;indefinite&amp;quot; when both disjuncts are. One of the most con-
vincing arguments in favor of Pinkal&apos;s Precisification Logic is that it is in accord with
our intuitions on these cases, unlike most logics based on three (or more) truth values.
In the last two chapters of the book, the question of vagueness is taken up again,
in the light of problems raised by measure statements and by the sorites paradox.
Pinkal concludes that a more radical approach than Precisification Logic is called for,
and develops a new formalization of precisification in which an increase in precision
corresponds to a context change in the sense of Kamp (1981b).

4. General comments
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999946217391304">
Why should a computational linguist read this book? One reason is that it is a very ac-
cessible introduction to the literature on vagueness, and an accessible compendium of
many useful techniques in formal semantics. Computational linguists who believe that
truth conditions have to do with the meaning of natural language expressions—and
this reviewer agrees with Pinkal that at the moment there is no other way of expressing
mathematical generalizations about meaning—should, in addition, find the question
of how logic relates to the &amp;quot;natural world&amp;quot; extremely important. As for computational
linguists who dismiss logic on the grounds that it depends on implausible assump-
tions, they may discover in Pinkal&apos;s book that such assumptions can be relaxed in
various ways.
The most convincing part of Pinkal&apos;s theory is his account of vagueness. The
supervaluation-based approach, as revised in the last chapters, is extremely attractive
because it is a way to &amp;quot;tame&amp;quot; vagueness that does not require us to abandon the
basic laws of logic entirely, and can be built into essentially any semantic theory.
The tools introduced in Precisification Logic to characterize precise expressions and
relative expressions provide a way of specifying properties of lexical items not usually
captured by existing lexica.
I found the arguments supporting the connection between ambiguity and vague-
ness less convincing. I have no problems with Pinkal&apos;s claim that both ambiguity
and vagueness have to do with precisification in a loose sense (rather than with, say,
the number of possible readings that an expression may have). However, it&apos;s by no
means clear that the same sort of precisification is involved in both cases. My in-
tuitions about the distinction between ambiguity and vagueness could be rephrased
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.743335333333333">
1 A supervaluation is a partial function that assigns a value to a logical expression a on the basis of the
values assigned to a by a set of classical interpretations. If all of these interpretations agree on a value
for a, the supervaluation also assigns to a that value; otherwise, the function is not defined.

using Pinkal&apos;s terminology as follows: Vagueness has to do with the relation between
language and the world; hence, the sense of precisification that we want to use for
this form of indefiniteness is &amp;quot;precisification with respect to the world,&amp;quot; and Pinkal&apos;s
treatment neatly captures this notion. The sense of precisification that seems to mat-
ter for ambiguity, instead, appears to be meta-theoretic: what gets precisified is not
the content of what the speaker said, but what the hearer thinks the speaker said.
This form of precisification seems to involve an augmentation of the context in the
sense of &amp;quot;what the speaker intended.&amp;quot; Prima facie, these intuitions would be captured
most accurately by a theory in which different forms of precisification are handled in
different ways. Pinkal does not provide a convincing argument to the contrary; his
claim that vagueness and ambiguity are but extremes of a continuum relies almost
entirely on his observation that ambiguity and vagueness cannot be distinguished by
simply saying that ambiguous statements have a finite number of readings, whereas
vague statements have an infinite number of them—which is probably correct, but
from which his conclusion doesn&apos;t follow. There are similar problems with some of
the other proposals that Pinkal introduces in chapter 4, such as his characterization
of the distinction between polysemy and homonymy. His suggestion doesn&apos;t reflect
the traditional descriptive characterization as formulated by, say, Lyons (1977), and
Pinkal&apos;s argument in favor of his alternative view is not entirely convincing.
A computational linguist hoping to find in Logic and Lexicon new ideas about
disambiguation will be disappointed. Although the disambiguation imperative provides
an intriguing characterization of the semantics of a class of ambiguous expressions
in terms of their disambiguation properties, and although the notion of context update
plays an important role in the last chapter, the question of which forms of reasoning
underlie disambiguation, and whether the logic Pinkal proposes is appropriate for this
task, is never raised.
This said, this book fills such a gap in the literature, and Pinkal&apos;s discussion is so
thorough, that anybody who is interested in either ambiguity or vagueness is likely
to benefit from it.

There are similar problems with some of the other proposals that Pinkal introduces in chapter 4, such as his characterization of the distinction between polysemy and homonymy. His suggestion doesn&apos;t reflect the traditional descriptive characterization as formulated by, say, Lyons (1977), and Pinkal&apos;s argument in favor of his alternative view is not entirely convincing. A computational linguist hoping to find in Logic and Lexicon new ideas about disambiguation will be disappointed. Although the disambiguation imperative provides an intriguing characterization of the semantics of a class of ambiguous expressions in terms of their disambiguation properties, and although the notion of context update plays an important role in the last chapter, the question of which forms of reasoning underlie disambiguation, and whether the logic Pinkal proposes is appropriate for this task, is </context>

Perhaps the most serious among the reasons for skepticism is that humans find it difficult, if not impossible, to assess the truth or falsity of statements as simple as Kim is tall or Robin is blond. Vague statements such as these are well within the scope of semantics, even when intended narrowly; thus if humans cannot assign them a clear truth value even when all contextual factors have been resolved, then perhaps truth conditions are not a solid enough foundation for semantics, after all. Manfred Pinkal&apos;s Logic and Lexicon, a revised translation of his Logik und Lexikon (Pinkal 1985), is the most comprehensive argument to date in favor of the position that the meaning of vague statements can in fact be expressed in truth-conditional terms. Pinkal also provides in his book a theory of ambiguity, a property of natural language utterances that is the source of endless trouble for computational linguists. Ambiguity—syntactic ambiguity and lexical ambiguity in particular—is a central concern both in computational linguistics and in psycholinguistics, but hasn&apos;t been a central area of research in linguistics, and in particular not in formal semantics.
