I will argue in this paper that the standard
notions of affectedness, change-of-state and
result state are too coarse-grained, and will
revise and enrich substantially their content,
increasing their role in a compositional aspect
construal procedure. I will claim in particular
that a proper theory of event structure requires
that enriched result states should be lexically
represented, and will base on them a
computational treatment of event structure
within a feature-structure-based lexicon.

Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999867833333333">
Event structure is traditionally accounted for using
two sets of notions : change-of-state / affectedness
and incrementality. I will examine both in this paper,
determining their respective limitations, before
proposing an alternative approach and the formal
specifications for a computational implementation.

how can we account for event structure?
1.1 Affectedness, change-of-state and
telicity
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995925">
Telic events are generally viewed as an opposition
between a previously holding state and a new one,
called a result state (e.g. dead(y) for x kills y). They
trigger a change-of-state (CoS, henceforth), result
states (RSs, henceforth) being entailments of CoSs.
Moens and Steedman (1988), Smith (1991),
Pustejovsky (1995), and others argue that it is a
defining property of telic events. They should
therefore include an `undergoer&apos; argument, whose
CoS determines the telicity of the event (i.e., it acts as
a measuring-out argument). Tenny (1987) thus
claims that telic events require such an argument,
which she calls an affected argument. Consider for
instance John reviewed the paper: as the event
reaches its culimation, the affected argument
undergoes a CoS (from —ireviewed(paper) to
reviewed(paper)), producing a RS. To put it short, the
standard theory of event structure says that telicity
implies affectedness (and conversely), and that
affectedness implies a CoS/RS (and conversely),
associating tightly all those notions.
Unfortunately, not all measuring-out arguments are
affected arguments:

<bodyText confidence="0.9941953">
Jackendoff (1996:309) observed that (implicit) paths
such as on the deck in (1) are not affected arguments,
so that the telicity of such motion events cannot be
explained using affectedness, ruling out a unified
affectedness-based account of telicity&apos;. It follows
from this objection that the standard theory should be
at least amended. Jackendoff&apos;s solution is a general
mapping function from measuring-out arguments
(seen as paths) to events. It is related to
incrementality, which I am discussing below.

1.2 Result states and incrementality

Event-object mapping functions, as proposed in
Krifka (1992) and Dowty (1991), are another key
approach to the treatment of event structure. Dowty
(1991) calls an incremental theme any argument
Yet motion verbs could be attributed an affected
argument, i.e., their agents, so that • Jackendoff&apos; s point
against affectedness does not seem to be decisive.

capable of measuring-out an event. For instance, the
drinking event in (2) can be measured along the
quantity of beer contained in the glass through
functions mapping the latter onto the former.
(2) John drank a glass of beer.
The glass of beer in (2) undergoes an incremental
CoS, and is therefore an incremental theme. Path-
objects (cf. Mary walked the Appalachian trail ;
Tenny 1994), can be treated as some special kind of
incremental themes, and Jackendoff&apos;s solution could
thus be reformulated using incrementality2.
Let us turn now to the treatment of so-called
achievement verbs (cf. Vendler 1957). Most authors
do not grant them incremental themes. Dowty (1991),
for instance, argues that incremental themes must be
able to undergo an incremental CoS:

<listItem confidence="0.726995333333333">
(3a) ??The horse finished crossing the line.
(OK in slow motion)
(3b) The horses finished crossing the line.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.982118">
(3a) shows indeed that cross the line lacks proper
subevents, and that no incremental CoS occurs. But
Dowty never considered examples such as (3b),
which receive an incremental reading (albeit of a
different kind, since the subevents construed in (3)
involve individual parts of a set of objects rather than
non-individual parts of an individual object, as in
(2)). Therefore, I will conclude that the kind of
affected arguments which achievement verbs possess
can also be regarded as incremental themes. It seems
at this point that all kinds of telic events can be
analysed in terms of incrementality. However, I will
show in the following section that this is not the case.
Generally speaking, relying on incrementality alone
would mean relegating CoSs and RSs to the
backstage of aspect construal3 : in order to account
for telicity without affectedness, one should deny a
central role to CoSs, and regard telicity primarily as a
matter of measure. I will propose an alternative
solution in the following sections preserving the
centrality of CoS, yet departing from the standard

approach to affectedness and CoS, and justified by
data falling outside the scope of incrementality.
2. A richer conception of result states
for a proper treatment of event structure

2.1 RSs with and without change-of-state
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999505285714286">
I will argue here that different types of affectedness
and RSs (e.g., entailing a CoS for telic events, and
not entailing a CoS for atelic ones) should be
distinguished, going against the predominant
position. Few authors mention the possibility for
atelic events to receive RSs, or do it incidentally
(e.g., Parsons 1990). But consider the following data:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999574727272727">
(4) Look! Mona has been very sick!
(5) Mona has already sailed.
(4) and (5) denote a present state-of-affairs (Mona&apos;s
poor looks in (4) / sailing expertise in (5)) following a
past fact — yet no CoS is involved. Let us now turn to
verbs of gradual CoS:
(6) Mona cooked this chicken in I for two hours.
(7) Mona has only slightly I not too much cooked
her chicken.
(8) ??John has only slightly I not too much drunk
his glass of beer.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.924532555555556">
(6) can be read as telic or atelic, and although its
internal argument is undergoing a CoS, it is not an
incremental CoS, since the whole of the chicken is
gradually affected (and not its subparts ; compare
(2)). It seems rather that the progression of the
cooking event depends on the internal structure of the
associated RS : the event develops as the chicken is
more and more cooked (see Ramchand (1997) for a
similar analysis4). The types of RSs and affectedness
involved differ clearly from those of the incremental
telic events considered so far. Such RSs as that of
4 Jackendoff (1996) also proposes RSs as paths for such
events. But the impact on event structure of the difference
between the scalar CoS in (6) and the incremental one in
(2) cannot be motivated in such works, since it is related to
a difference in the associated RSs. The incrementality
approach misses this point, so that RS-based paths are
rather ad hoc devices.

cook are scalar, i.e., can vary in terms of degrees (see
(7)), so that a &apos;final&apos; degree may or may not be
reached. Contrariwise, incremental events are not
endowed with scalar RSs / affectedness (cf. (8)) : one
does not drink something `to a certain degree /
intensity&apos;. It appears now that a proper treatment of
event structure requires a richer conception of RSs,
CoSs and affectedness, and cannot be exclusively
based on incrementality.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998296">
2.2 RStages as sets of sorted RSs
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99990625">
To formulate an alternative treatment of event
structure accounting for the data presented above, I
will introduce result stages (RStages henceforth),
consisting of one or several RSs. I am moreover
assuming here that semantic features and categories
are treated within a multi-sortal logic, possessing a
hierarchy of sorts organized as an inheritance-based
lattice structure (see White 1994).

<bodyText confidence="0.931332230769231">
I assume that events canonically break down into at
least two stages: RStages and Inner Stages (noted
IStages), the latter describing an events&apos; development
— e.g., the drinking process assumed to precede the
end of a drinking event.
Briefly, telic events will receive a binary RStage (cf
(10)) consisting of a primary RS and a secondary RS,
the former being related to the development of the
event (cf. John has been drinking beer) and the latter
to its culmination (i.e., to the state of affairs arising
from the event&apos;s final completion ; cf. John has drunk
a beer). Moreover, the secondary RS should be the
complementary of the primary RS, so as to cause a
definite CoS5. The diagrams (9) and (10) indicate that
the primary RSs of drink and run overlap with their
respective IStages, and that the Secondary RS of
drink abuts with both its primary RS and IStage.
Moreover, the sortal opposition between primary and
secondary RSs should be viewed as a transition
function. I assume here that transition functions (i.e.,
functions allowing for CoSs) require such binary
sortal domains, in the spirit of Pustejovsky
(forthcoming). Some kind of causal relationship is
5 Path-object verbs as in (1) can also be analysed in terms
of RStages. I will not discuss here the treatment of this and
many other event types for want of space.

also assumed to hold between IStages and RStages in
the case of telic events.
Telic scalar verbs like cook will receive binary
RStages with scalar primary RSs. Scalar RSs will be
defined through scalar sortal domains, so as to
account for the behaviour of those verbs. I will not
study here their atelic readings for want of space to
do so. Finally, since atelic events do not entail a CoS,
I will assign them unary RStages, devoid of primary
RSs, so that no opposition between two RSs (and
therefore no CoS) arises — see (10).

3. Encoding RStages in the lexicon
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999947666666667">
I will now propose the formal specifications for a
lexical computational implementation of the above
treatment. Each verb will be assigned a sorted
RStage, sorts being used as well-formedness
conditions. I am proposing in figure 1 a lexical entry
for drink within the Generative Lexicon framework
(cf. Pustejovsky (1995)). It can be adapted to any
type of feature-structure-based computational
lexicon, though. Note that the m-inc and i-inc
functions are homomorphic aspectual roles relating
events to the individual vs. material subparts of
objects (see Caudal (1999) for further details).

Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999979555555556">
The treatment proposed here receives indirect support
from recent developments in the syntax-semantics
interface underlining the importance of affectedness
and CoS in argument structure and aspect construal ;
cf. Ramchand (1998). Yet the novelty of this
approach to event structure should be stressed w.r.t.
the standard notions prevailing in the (even recent)
literature, while it does not belittle the role of the
usual apparatus about IStages, telicity and event-
object mapping functions. It rather pairs them with
RStages. Finally, the present account offers a more
unified and explanatory treatment of event structure
than those essentially based on incrementality, since
they have to rely on RS-based paths to explain the
telicity of scalar verbs and resultative constructions.
To my knowledge, and although it has not been
exposed here in detail, the RStage-based approach to
event structure can be extended to all event types.

It is related to incrementality, which I am discussing below. 1.2 Result states and incrementality Event-object mapping functions, as proposed in Krifka (1992) and Dowty (1991), are another key approach to the treatment of event structure. Dowty (1991) calls an incremental theme any argument Yet motion verbs could be attributed an affected argument, i.e., their agents, so that • Jackendoff&apos; s point against affectedness does not seem to be decisive. 233 Proceedings of EACL &apos;99 capable of measuring-out an event.

A richer conception of result states for a proper treatment of event structure 2.1 RSs with and without change-of-state I will argue here that different types of affectedness and RSs (e.g., entailing a CoS for telic events, and not entailing a CoS for atelic ones) should be distinguished, going against the predominant position. Few authors mention the possibility for atelic events to receive RSs, or do it incidentally (e.g., Parsons 1990). But consider the following data: (4) Look! Mona has been very sick!

Finally, since atelic events do not entail a CoS, I will assign them unary RStages, devoid of primary RSs, so that no opposition between two RSs (and therefore no CoS) arises — see (10). 3. Encoding RStages in the lexicon I will now propose the formal specifications for a lexical computational implementation of the above treatment. Each verb will be assigned a sorted RStage, sorts being used as well-formedness conditions. I am proposing in figure 1 a lexical entry for drink within the Generative Lexicon framework (cf. Pustejovsky (1995)). It can be adapted to any type of feature-structure-based computational lexicon, though. Note that the m-inc and i-inc functions are homomorphic aspectual roles relating events to the individual vs. material subparts of objects (see Caudal (1999) for further details). 235 Proceedings of EACL &apos;99 Figure 1.

(6) can be read as telic or atelic, and although its internal argument is undergoing a CoS, it is not an incremental CoS, since the whole of the chicken is gradually affected (and not its subparts ; compare (2)). It seems rather that the progression of the cooking event depends on the internal structure of the associated RS : the event develops as the chicken is more and more cooked (see Ramchand (1997) for a similar analysis4). The types of RSs and affectedness involved differ clearly from those of the incremental telic events considered so far. Such RSs as that of 4 Jackendoff (1996) also proposes RSs as paths for such events. But the impact on event structure of the difference between the scalar CoS in (6) and the incremental one in (2) cannot be motivated in such works, since it is related to a difference in the associated RSs.

The Delimited sort indicates delimited events, while the Binary_m-inc_RStage sort bears the transition function (i.e., the binary sortal domain) attached to drink, thus allowing it to be read as an incremental telic event; cf. (9). Conclusion The treatment proposed here receives indirect support from recent developments in the syntax-semantics interface underlining the importance of affectedness and CoS in argument structure and aspect construal ; cf. Ramchand (1998). Yet the novelty of this approach to event structure should be stressed w.r.t. the standard notions prevailing in the (even recent) literature, while it does not belittle the role of the usual apparatus about IStages, telicity and eventobject mapping functions. It rather pairs them with RStages. Finally, the present account offers a more unified and explanatory treatment of event structure than those essentially based on incrementality, since they have to rely on RS-based paths to explain the telicity of scalar verbs and resultative constructions.
