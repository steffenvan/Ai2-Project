In this paper we aim to detect some as-
pects of adjectival meanings. Concepts of
adjectives are distributed by SOM (Self-
Organizing map) whose feature vectors
are calculated by MI (Mutual Informa-
tion). For the SOM obtained, we make
tight clusters from map nodes, calculated
by cosine. In addition, the number of
tight clusters obtained by cosine was in-
creased using map nodes and Japanese
thesaurus. As a result, the number of ex-
tended clusters of concepts was 149 clus-
ters. From the map, we found 8 adjectival
clusters in super-ordinate level and some
tendencies of similar and dissimilar clus-
ters.

This paper aims to find a diversity range of ad-
jectival meanings from a coordinate map in
which &amp;quot;close-distant&amp;quot; relationships between ad-
jectival classes is reflected. In related research
over adjectives, Alonge et.al (2000), Solar (2003),
Marrafa and Mendes (2006) suggested that
WordNet and EuroWordNet lack sufficient ad-
jectival classes and semantic relations, and ex-
tended the resources over such relations.
For the sake of identifying the diversity of ad-
jectival meanings, it is necessary to analyze ad-
jectival semantics via &amp;quot;close-distant&amp;quot; relation-
ships extracted from texts. In our work on ex-
tracting adjective semantics, we consider abstract
nouns as semantic proxies of adjectives. For the
clustering method, we utilized a self-organizing

map (SOM) based on a neural network model
(Kohonen, 1997). One of the features of SOM is
that it assigns words coordinates, allowing for
the possibility of visualizing word similarity.
SOM has two advantages for our task. One is
that we can utilize the map nodes of words to
locate members of clusters that clustering meth-
ods have failed to classify. The other is that the
map shows the relative relations of whole clus-
ters of adjectival concepts. By observing such a
map in which the relations of clusters are re-
flected, we can analyze the diversity of adjectival
meaning.

2 Abstract Nouns that Categorize Ad-
jectives
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999593125">
Collocations between adjectives and nouns in
“concrete value and its concept” relations can be
used to represent adjectival semantics. Nemoto
(1969) indicated that expressions such as “iro ga
akai (the color is red)” and “hayasa ga hayai
(literally, the speed is fast)” are a kind of
tautology. Some studies have suggested that
some abstract nouns collocating with adjectives
are hypernymic concepts (or concepts) of those
adjectives, and that some semantic relations
between abstract nouns and adjectives represent
a kind of repetition of meaning.
This paper defines such abstract nouns as the
semantic categorization of an adjective (or an
adjectival concept).
The data for this study was obtained by ex-
tracting adjectives co-occurring with abstract
nouns in 100 novels, 100 essays, and 42 years of
newspaper articles.
We extracted the abstract nouns according to
the procedure described by Kanzaki et.al (2006).
Here, they evaluated the category labels of adjec-
tives obtained by the proposed procedure and
found that for 63% of the adjectives, the ex-

tracted categories were found to be appropriate.
We constructed a list as follows:
Abstract Nouns:
Adjectives modifying abstract nouns
KIMOCHI (feeling):
ureshii (glad), kanashii (sad),
shiawasena (happy) ...
In this list, “KIMOCHI (feeling)” is defined by
“ureshii (glad), kanashii (sad), and shiawasena
(happy)”, for example. Here, each abstract noun
conveys the concept or hypernym of the given
adjectives.
Next we classify these abstract nouns based on
their co-occurring adjectives using SOM.

3.1 Input Data
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999916">
In our SOM, we use adjectives which occur more
than four times in our corpus. The number of
such adjectives was 2374. Then we identified
361 abstract nouns that co-occurred with four or
more of the adjectives. The maximum number of
co-occurring adjectives for a given abstract noun
in the corpus was 1,594.
In the data, each abstract noun was defined by
a feature vector, in the form of noun co-
occurrences represented by pointwise mutual
information (Manning and Schutze, 1999). Mu-
tual information (MI) is an information theoric
measure and has been used in many NLP tasks,
including clustering words (e.g. Lin and Pantel,
2002).

3.2 SOM
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999981354166667">
Kohonen’s self-organizing map (SOM) is an un-
supervised learning method, where input in-
stances are projected onto a grid/map of nodes
arranged in an n-dimensional space. Input in-
stances are usually high-dimensional data, while
the map is usually two-dimensional (i.e., n = 2).
Thus, SOM essentially reduces the dimensional-
ity of the data, and can be used as an effective
tool for data visualization – projecting complex,
high-dimensional data onto a low-dimensional
map. SOM can also be utilized for clustering.
Each node in a map represents a cluster and is
associated with a reference vector of m-
dimensions, where m is the dimension of the in-
put instances. During learning, input instances
are mapped to a map node whose (current) refer-
ence vector is the closest to the instance vector
(where SOM uses Euclidean distance as the
measure of similarity by default), and the refer-
ence vectors are gradually smoothed so that the
differences between the reference vector and the
instance vectors mapped to the node are mini-
mized. This way, instances mapped to the same
node form a cluster, and the reference vector es-
sentially corresponds to the centroid of the clus-
ter.
SOM maps are self-organizing in the sense
that input instances that are similar are gradually
pulled closer during learning and assigned to
nodes that are topographically close to one an-
other on the map. The mapping from input in-
stances to map nodes is one-to-one (i.e., one in-
stance is assigned to exactly one node), but from
map nodes to instances, the mapping is one-to-
many (i.e., one map node is assigned to zero, one,
or more instances).
The input data was the set of 361 abstract
nouns defined by the 2,374 co-occurring adjec-
tives, as described in the previous section. These
abstract nouns were distributed visually on the 2-
dimensional map based on co-occurring adjec-
tives. This map is a “map of adjective semantics”
because the abstract nouns are identified as prox-
ies for adjective semantics.
As mentioned before, similar words are lo-
cated in neighboring nodes on the 2-dimensional
map. The next step is to identify similar clusters
on the map.

4.1 Tight Clusters from the Map Nodes
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999820666666667">
In SOMs, each node represents a cluster, i.e. a set
of nouns assigned to the same node. These nouns
are very similar and can be considered to be
synonyms. However, nouns that are similar
might map to different nodes because the algo-
rithm’s self-organization is sensitive to the pa-
rameter settings. To account for this, and also to
obtain a more (coarse-grained) qualitative de-
scription of the map, tight clusters—clusters of
map nodes whose reference vectors are signifi-
cantly close—were extracted. All groupings of
map nodes whose average cosine coefficient be-
tween the reference vectors in the group was
greater than 0.96 were extracted (Salton and
McGill, 1983).

<bodyText confidence="0.99960025">
The total number of clusters was 213. Excluding
singleton clusters, the number of clustes was 81.
229 concepts were classified into 81 clusters,
with 132 concepts not classified into any cluster.

In order to evaluate the quality of the concep-
tual classification, we utilized the “Bunruigoi-
hyou” Japanese thesaurus (National Institute of
Japanese Language, 1964). In “Bunruigoihyou,”
each category is assigned a 5-digit category
number, with close numbers indicating similar
categories.
Among the 81 with two or more concepts, the
number of clusters containing words with the
same class was 36. That is, for 44% of the clus-
ters, the constituent nouns had the same “Bun-
ruigoihyou” class label. The ratio of concept
agreement between &amp;quot;Bunruigiohyou” and our
obtained clusters was found to be 20.87/81=0.25.
We also compared tight clusters by performing
hierarchical clustering with the k-means algo-
rithm.
The results of the hierarchical clustering were as
follows:
1) The rate of clusters agreeing with “Bunruigoi-
hyou”: 30/96 = 0.31
2) The average rate of agreement for each tight
cluster: 21.07/96 = 0.21
In the case of k-means:
3)The rate of clusters agreeing with “Bunruigoi-
hyou”: 33/143 = 0.23
4) The average rate of agreement for each tight
cluster: 28.37/143 = 0.198
From these results, we can observe that clus-
ters obtained with cosine similarity agree more
with the Japanese thesaurus than the other two
methods. Therefore, in terms of quality, clusters
obtained by cosine similarity seem to be superior
to the others.

4.3 Using the Position of Map Nodes
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999987444444445">
However, even for the result obtained with co-
sine similarity, 132 concepts were not classified
into any clusters. Additionally, the clusters ap-
pear to be overly fine grained: most tight clusters
include 1, 2 or 3 concepts. In order to find simi-
lar concepts that cosine similarity failed to clus-
ter together, we used the position information of
the map nodes.
After we plotted clusters obtained by cosine
similarity on the map, we checked for singleton
concepts located near a cluster which are mem-
bers of the same “Bunruigoihyou” class. Also,
we checked to see if concepts in clusters located
at neighboring nodes could be clustered together
using the category numbers of “Bunruigoihyou. ”
By extending the clusters, we generated a total
of 149 clusters, including 68 with two or more
elements and 81 singleton clusters.

In the final map, clusters at the superordinate
level are located around the center of the map.
Upper level concepts tend to agree with clusters
in “Bunruigoihyou.” For examples, “image and
impression,” “situation and state”, “feeling and
mood” are located around the center of the map.

one/something), yousou (aspect)
Cluster3: kanten (viewpoint), tachiba (stand-

Cluster6: fun’iki, kuuki, kehai (atmosphere)
Cluster7: kimochi, kanji (feeling)
Cluster8: joutai (state), joukyou (situation)
In our experiment, at the top level, adjectival
concepts seem to be divided into 8 basic clusters.
From the distribution of the map, we find “close-
distant” relationships between clusters, that is
clusters located far from each other tend to be
semantically disparate. In terms of adjective se-
mantics, the semantic relationship between “ki-
mochi, kanji (feeling)” (Cluster7) and “seishitsu
(characteristics of someone/something), yousou
(aspect)” are distant.
However, “kimochi, kanji (feeling)” (Cluster7)
has a close relation to “fun’iki, kuuki, kehai
(atmosphere) ” (Cluster6) and also “joutai (state),
joukyou (situation)” (Cluster8).

1. In our experiment, 77 adjectives belonged
to one or two clusters. Though there is the
possibility of data sparseness, there is also
the possibility that the meanings of these
adjectives are specific. Examples of adjec-
tives belonging to specific clusters are as
follows:
Adjectives in distant relationships;
- Clusters 2: keisandakai (seeing everything in
terms of money), ken’meina

Japanese adjectives are often said to represent
“kanjou (mental state)”, “joutai (state),” “seisitsu
(characteristics)” and “teido (degree)”, in addi-
tion to “positive/negative image.” In our experi-
ment, the SOM unearthed not only these adjecti-
val meanings, but also “inshou (impression)”,
“taido (attitude)”, “kanten (viewpoint)” and
“sugata (outlook)”, which seem to be discrimina-
tive meanings of adjectives.

We classified 361 concepts based on 2374 adjec-
tives using a self-organizing map. Since the
SOM shows the distribution visually, it provides
not only clusters of adjectives but also “close-
distant” relationships between clusters. As a re-
sult, adjectival concepts at the superordinate
level are divided into 8 main clusters. The results
not only verify previous work but also suggest
new discriminative adjective classes. One of the
advantages of SOM is that it presents its outputs
visually. As a result, we can explore “close- dis-
tant” relationships between clusters, and analyze
the meaning of each. In addition to increasing the
range of adjectival classes and improving our
method, our method provides the means to ana-
lyze concepts which did not agree with those in
existing thesauri such as “Bunruigoihyou”, the
EDR dictionary or Japanese Word Net.

In related research over adjectives, Alonge et.al (2000), Solar (2003), Marrafa and Mendes (2006) suggested that WordNet and EuroWordNet lack sufficient adjectival classes and semantic relations, and extended the resources over such relations. For the sake of identifying the diversity of adjectival meanings, it is necessary to analyze adjectival semantics via &amp;quot;close-distant&amp;quot; relationships extracted from texts. In our work on extracting adjective semantics, we consider abstract nouns as semantic proxies of adjectives. For the clustering method, we utilized a self-organizing © 2008.

One is that we can utilize the map nodes of words to locate members of clusters that clustering methods have failed to classify. The other is that the map shows the relative relations of whole clusters of adjectival concepts. By observing such a map in which the relations of clusters are reflected, we can analyze the diversity of adjectival meaning. 2 Abstract Nouns that Categorize Adjectives Collocations between adjectives and nouns in “concrete value and its concept” relations can be used to represent adjectival semantics. Nemoto (1969) indicated that expressions such as “iro ga akai (the color is red)” and “hayasa ga hayai (literally, the speed is fast)” are a kind of tautology. Some studies have suggested that some abstract nouns collocating with adjectives are hypernymic concepts (or concepts) of those adjectives, and that some semantic relations between abstract nouns and adjectives represent a kind of repetition of meaning. This paper defines such abstract nouns as the semantic categorization of an adjective (or an adjectival concept). The data for this study was obtained by extracting adjectives co-occurring with abstr</context>
