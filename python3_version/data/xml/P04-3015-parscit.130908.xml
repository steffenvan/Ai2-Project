Abstract
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998994">
In this paper, we propose a method of auto-
matically extracting word hierarchies based on
the inclusion relation of appearance patterns
from corpora. We apply a complementary
similarity measure to find a hierarchical word
structure. This similarity measure was devel-
oped for the recognition of degraded machine-
printed text in the field and can be applied to
estimate one-to-many relations. Our purpose is
to extract word hierarchies from corpora
automatically. As the initial task, we attempt
to extract hierarchies of abstract nouns co-
occurring with adjectives in Japanese and
compare with hierarchies in the EDR elec-
tronic dictionary.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999793933333334">
The hierarchical relations of words are useful as
language resources. Hierarchical semantic lexical
databases such as WordNet (Miller et al., 1990)
and the EDR electronic dictionary (1995) are used
for NLP research worldwide to fully understand a
word meaning. In current thesauri in the form of
hierarchical relations, words are categorized manu-
ally and classified in a top-down manner based on
human intuition. This is a good way to make a
lexical database for users having a specific purpose.
However, word hierarchies based on human intui-
tion tend to vary greatly depending on the lexicog-
rapher. In addition, hierarchical relations based on
various data may be needed depending on each
user.
Accordingly, we try to extract a hierarchical re-
lation of words automatically and statistically. In
previous research, ways of extracting from defini-
tion sentences in dictionaries (Tsurumaru et al.,
1986; Shoutsu et al., 2003) or from a corpus by
using patterns such as “a part of”, “is-a”, or “and”
(Berland and Charniak, 1999; Caraballo, 1999)
have been proposed. Also, there is a method that
uses the dependence relation between words taken
from a corpus (Matsumoto et al., 1996). In contrast,
we propose a method based on the inclusion rela-
tion of appearance patterns from corpora.
In this paper, to verify the suitability of our
method, we attempt to extract hierarchies of ab-
stract nouns co-occurring with adjectives in Japa-
nese. We select two similarity measures to estimate
the inclusion relation between word appearance
patterns. One is a complementary similarity meas-
ure; i.e., a similarity measure developed for the
recognition of degraded machine-printed text in the
field (Hagita and Sawaki, 1995). This measure can
be used to estimate one-to-many relations such as
superordinate–subordinate relations from appear-
ance patterns (Yamamoto and Umemura, 2002).
The second similarity measure is the overlap coef-
ficient, which is a similarity measure to calculate
the rate of overlap between two binary vectors.
Using each measure, we extract hierarchies from a
corpus. After that, we compare these with the EDR
electronic dictionary.

2 Experiment Corpus
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.906171739130435">
A good deal of linguistic research has focused on
the syntactic and semantic functions of abstract
nouns (Nemoto, 1969; Takahashi, 1975; Schmid,
2000; Kanzaki et al., 2003). In the example, “Vagi
(goat) wa seishitsu (nature) ga otonashii (gentle)
(The nature of goats is gentle).”, Takahashi (1975)
recognized that the abstract noun “seishitsu (na-
ture)” is a hypernym of the attribute that the predi-
cative adjective “otonashi (gentle)” expresses.
Kanzaki et al. (2003) defined such abstract nouns
that co-occur with adjectives as adjective hy-
pernyms, and extracted these co-occurrence rela-
tions between abstract nouns and adjectives from
many corpora such as newspaper articles. In the
linguistic data, there are sets of co-occurring
adjectives for each abstract noun – the total num-
ber of abstract noun types is 365 and the number of
adjective types is 10,525. Some examples are as
follows.
OMOI (feeling): ureshii (glad), kanashii (sad),
shiawasena (happy), ...
KANTEN (viewpoint): igakutekina (medical),
rekishitekina (historical), ...

3 Complementary Similarity Measure
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999870428571428">
The complementary similarity measure (CSM) is
used in a character recognition method for binary
images which is robust against heavy noise or
graphical designs (Sawaki and Hagita, 1996). Ya-
mamoto et al. (2002) applied CSM to estimate one-
to-many relations between words. They estimated
one-to-many relations from the inclusion relations
between the appearance patterns of two words.
The appearance pattern is expressed as an n-
dimensional binary feature vector. Now, let F = (f1,
f2, ..., fn) and T = (t1, t2, ..., tn) (where fi, ti = 0 or
1) be the feature vectors of the appearance patterns
for a word and another word, respectively. The
CSM of F to T is defined as

(a + c)(b + d)
b = (1 )
∑ i = 1
n − ⋅
f t
i i ,
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999935">
The CSM of F to T represents the degree to
which F includes T; that is, the inclusion relation
between the appearance patterns of two words.
In our experiment, each “word” is an abstract
noun. Therefore, n is the number of adjectives in
the corpus, a indicates the number of adjectives co-
occurring with both abstract nouns, b and c indi-
cate the number of adjectives co-occurring with
either abstract noun, and d indicates the number of
adjectives co-occurring with neither abstract noun.

<bodyText confidence="0.999978111111111">
The overlap coefficient (OVLP) is a similarity
measure for binary vectors (Manning and Schutze,
1999). OVLP is essentially a measure of inclusion.
It has a value of 1.0 if every dimension with a non-
zero value for the first vector is also non-zero for
the second vector or vice versa. In other words, the
value is 1.0 when the first vector completely in-
cludes the second vector or vice versa. OVLP of F
and T is defined as

5 EDR hierarchy
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999449">
The EDR Electronic Dictionary (1995) was de-
veloped for advanced processing of natural lan-
guage by computers and is composed of eleven
sub-dictionaries. The sub-dictionaries include a
concept dictionary, word dictionaries, bilingual
dictionaries, etc. We verify and analyse the hierar-
chies that are extracted based on a comparison with
the EDR dictionary. However, the hierarchies in
EDR consist of hypernymic concepts represented
by sentences. On the other hand, our extracted hi-
erarchies consist of hypernyms such as abstract
nouns. Therefore, we have to replace the concept
composed of a sentence with the sequence of the
words. We replace the description of concepts with
entry words from the “Word List by Semantic
Principles” (1964) and add synonyms. We also add
to abstract nouns in order to reduce any difference
in representation. In this way, conceptual hierar-
chies of adjectives in the EDR dictionary are de-
fined by the sequence of words.

6 Hierarchy Extraction Process
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993344375">
The processes for hierarchy extraction from the
corpus are as follows. “TH” is a threshold value for
each pair under consideration. If TH is low, we can
obtain long hierarchies. However, if TH is too low,
the number of word pairs taken into consideration
increases overwhelmingly and the measurement
reliability diminishes. In this experiment, we set
0.2 as TH.

<listItem confidence="0.991324363636363">
1. Compute the similarity between appear-
ance patterns for each pair of words. The
hierarchical relation between the two
words in a pair is determined by the simi-
larity value. We express the pair as (X, Y),
where X is a hypernym of Y and Y is a
hyponym of X.
2. Sort the pairs by the normalized similari-
ties and reduce the pairs where the simi-
larity is less than TH.

archy and has the highest value in pairs

archy C is a hypernym.

the current hierarchy.
D) While such a pair can be chosen, repeat
B) and C).

A is not contained in the current hier-
archy and has the highest value in pairs

erarchy B is a hypernym.

Some extracted hierarchies are as follows. In our
experiment, we get koto (matter) as the common
hypernym.
koto (matter) -- joutai (state) -- kankei (relation)
-- kakawari (something to do with) -- tsukiai
(have an acquaintance with)
koto (matter) -- toki (when) -- yousu (aspect) --
omomochi (one’s face) -- manazashi (a look) --
iro (on one’s face) -- shisen (one’s eye)

8 Comparison
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992645">
We analyse extracted hierarchies by using the
number of nodes that agree with the EDR hierar-
chy. Specifically, we count the number of nodes
(nouns) which agree with a word in the EDR hier-
archy, preserving the order of each hierarchy. Here,
two hierarchies are “A - B - C - D - E” and “A - B
- D - F - G.” They have three agreement nodes; “A
-

<bodyText confidence="0.999862428571428">
Table 1 shows the distribution of the depths of a
CSM hierarchy, and the number of nodes that
agree with the EDR hierarchy at each depth. Table
2 shows the same for an OVLP one. “Agreement
Level” is the number of agreement nodes. The bold
font represents the number of hierarchies com-
pletely included in the EDR hierarchy.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999491">
8.1 Depth of Hierarchy
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9996042">
The number of hierarchies made from the EDR
dictionary (EDR hierarchy) is 932 and the deepest
level is 14. The number of CSM hierarchies is 105
and the depth is from 3 to 14 (Table 1). The num-
ber of OVLP hierarchies is 179 and the depth is
from 2 to 9 (Table 2). These results show that
CSM builds a deeper hierarchy than OVLP, though
the number of hierarchies is less than OVLP. Also,
the deepest level of CSM equals that of EDR.
Therefore, comparison with the EDR dictionary is
an appropriate way to verify the hierarchies that we
have extracted.
In both tables, we find most hierarchies have an
agreement level from 2 to 4. The deepest agree-
ment level is 6. For an agreement level of 5 or bet-
ter, the OVLP hierarchy includes only two hierar-
chies while the CSM hierarchy includes nine hier-
archies. This means CSM can extract hierarchies
having more nodes which agree with the EDR hi-
erarchy than is possible with OVLP.

Also, many abstract nouns agree with the hy-
peronymic concept around the top level. In current
thesauri, the categorization of words is classified in
a top-down manner based on human intuition.
Therefore, we believe the hierarchy that we have
built is consistent with human intuition, at least
around the top level of hyperonymic concepts.

9 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99995480952381">
We have proposed a method of automatically ex-
tracting hierarchies based on an inclusion relation
of appearance patterns from corpora. In this paper,
we attempted to extract objective hierarchies of
abstract nouns co-occurring with adjectives in
Japanese. In our experiment, we showed that com-
plementary similarity measure can extract a kind of
hierarchy from corpora, though it is a similarity
measure developed for the recognition of degraded
machine-printed text. Also, we can find interesting
hierarchies which suit human intuition, though
they are different from exact hierarchies. Kanzaki
et al. (2004) have applied our approach to verify
classification of abstract nouns by using self-
organization map. We can look a suitability of our
result at that work.
In our future work, we will use our approach for
other parts of speech and other types of word.
Moreover, we will compare with current alterna-
tive approaches such as those based on sentence
patterns.

In this paper, to verify the suitability of our method, we attempt to extract hierarchies of abstract nouns co-occurring with adjectives in Japanese. We select two similarity measures to estimate the inclusion relation between word appearance patterns. One is a complementary similarity measure; i.e., a similarity measure developed for the recognition of degraded machine-printed text in the field (Hagita and Sawaki, 1995). This measure can be used to estimate one-to-many relations such as superordinate–subordinate relations from appearance patterns (Yamamoto and Umemura, 2002). The second similarity measure is the overlap coefficient, which is a similarity measure to calculate the rate of overlap between two binary vectors. Using each measure, we extract hierarchies from a corpus.

In our experiment, each “word” is an abstract noun. Therefore, n is the number of adjectives in the corpus, a indicates the number of adjectives cooccurring with both abstract nouns, b and c indicate the number of adjectives co-occurring with either abstract noun, and d indicates the number of adjectives co-occurring with neither abstract noun. 4 Overlap Coefficient The overlap coefficient (OVLP) is a similarity measure for binary vectors (Manning and Schutze, 1999). OVLP is essentially a measure of inclusion. It has a value of 1.0 if every dimension with a nonzero value for the first vector is also non-zero for the second vector or vice versa. In other words, the value is 1.0 when the first vector completely includes the second vector or vice versa. OVLP of F and T is defined as 5 EDR hierarchy The EDR Electronic Dictionary (1995) was developed for advanced processing of natural language by computers and is composed of eleven sub-dictionaries.

This similarity measure was developed for the recognition of degraded machineprinted text in the field and can be applied to estimate one-to-many relations. Our purpose is to extract word hierarchies from corpora automatically. As the initial task, we attempt to extract hierarchies of abstract nouns cooccurring with adjectives in Japanese and compare with hierarchies in the EDR electronic dictionary. 1 Introduction The hierarchical relations of words are useful as language resources. Hierarchical semantic lexical databases such as WordNet (Miller et al., 1990) and the EDR electronic dictionary (1995) are used for NLP research worldwide to fully understand a word meaning. In current thesauri in the form of hierarchical relations, words are categorized manually and classified in a top-down manner based on human intuition. This is a good way to make a lexical database for users having a specific purpose. However, word hierarchies based on human intuition tend to vary greatly depending on the lexicographer. In addition, hierarchical relations based on various data may be needed depending on each user. Accordingly, we try to extract a hierarchical relat</context>
