Fass and Wilks (1983) propose the use, in a preference
semantics parser, of Van Eynde&apos;s &amp;quot;polysemy rules&amp;quot; to
distinguish a reading containing a metaphor from other
readings involving preference violations. The example
they give is
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.952624">
(1) Condition certain environmental data, such as:
A is the AGENT of a template and B is an action in
the ACTION slot of the same template. Subject
preference of B = ANIMATE. Head primitive of A
= VEHICLE.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.798034">
Assignment: Head primitive of A := ANIMATE.
The &amp;quot;condition&amp;quot; part of this rule is used in interpreting
the sentence

to recognise the reading containing the &amp;quot;helicopter&amp;quot; (as
opposed to &amp;quot;axe&amp;quot;) sense of &amp;quot;chopper&amp;quot; as metaphorical.
The &amp;quot;assignment&amp;quot; part removes the preference violation
so as to bring about the eventual acceptance of the
&amp;quot;helicopter&amp;quot; reading. The last part of the paper discusses
alternative strategies for removing such violations once a
metaphorical reading has been recognized.
I would like to point out that, no matter how sophisti-
cated the strategies used in their &amp;quot;assignment&amp;quot; parts,
rules with narrowly semantic &amp;quot;conditions&amp;quot; like that of (1)
cannot be generally adequate as a means of recognising
metaphors, and that recourse to a richer source of know-
ledge like Wilks&apos;s pseudo-texts is necessary in many
cases. Thus, given the sentence
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.869317">
(3) The chopper bit into the log.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.997658142857143">
rule (1) would incorrectly cause the reading containing
the &amp;quot;helicopter&amp;quot; sense of &amp;quot;chopper&amp;quot; to be recognised as
a metaphor and accepted, under the reasonable assump-
tion that &amp;quot;bite&amp;quot;, like &amp;quot;drink&amp;quot;, prefers an animate subject.
Neither can a version of (1) whose &amp;quot;condition&amp;quot; places
more detailed semantic restrictions on the formulas for A
and B to be adequate; the sentence

<listItem confidence="0.694159">
(4) The chopper bit into the runway.

<bodyText confidence="0.998838208333333">
describes (to me at least) a helicopter crash rather than a
chopping action. The &amp;quot;condition&amp;quot; part of a polysemy
rule capable of correctly recognising the metaphorical
readings of (2), (3), and (4) would require at least as
much information as a pseudo-text.
The implication of these examples is indeed not merely
that narrowly semantic criteria are generally inadequate
for metaphor recognition and that recognition requires
pseudo-text or similar world knowledge. If the only reli-
able way to identify a metaphor is to identify the event or
state it describes, as exploiting pseudo-texts for recogni-
tion implies, it follows that recognising a metaphor is in
fact determining what the metaphor is, and not merely
noticing that some metaphor is occurring. Thus recognis-
ing and characterising a metaphor may be much less
separable than the form of rule (1), and the particular
representation strategies of Fass and Wilks, would
suggest. In any case, even if they are separable, the fact
that pseudo-text or similar knowledge is required for
recognition suggests that the assumption by Fass and
Wilks that the characterisation of metaphors subsequent
to recognition can be achieved by simpler semantic, rath-
er than by more complex pseudo-text, strategies will not
hold.
