Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.99998525">
Even though the question answering
(QA) field appeared only in recent
years, there are systems for English
which obtain good results for open-
domain questions. The situation is very
different for other languages, mainly
due to the lack of NLP resources which
are normally used by QA systems. In
this paper, we present a project which
develops a QA system for Romanian.
The challenges we face and decisions
we have to make are discussed.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999659851851852">
Question answering (QA) emerged in the late
90s as a result of the Text Retrieval Conferences
(TREC). These conferences are designed to
evaluate the state-of-the-art in text retrieval and
allow the participants to evaluate their systems in
a consistent way by providing them a common
test set. Starting with TREC-8, in 1999, these
conferences contain a question answering track
in which the participants try to find the answer
to questions in a large collection of texts. As
a result of the TREC, the QA field witnessed
rapid development for English, but there are only
few systems which work for languages other than
English (Kim and Seo, 2002; Vetulani, 2002).
Another factor which slows down the development
of QA systems for other languages than English is
the lack of the modules which are normally used
in a QA system.
In this paper, we discuss the challenges we
have to face during the development of a question
answering system for Romanian language. This
paper is structured as follows: In Section 2, we
present the structure of our QA system. The
problems which need to be tackled when it
is implemented for Romanian are presented in
Section 3. A discussion of the project is presented
in Section 4, the article finishing with conclusions.

answering system
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999717269230769">
A QA system normally contains three modules:
a question processor, a document processor
and an answer extractor module (Harabagiu and
Moldovan, 2003). In addition, QA systems also
rely on a generic or specially designed search
engine. Our system follows this structure.
The question processor transforms a natural
language question in an internal representation
which can be a list of keywords or some kind of
logical form. The list of keywords can contain
only words from the question, or it can be
expanded with words related to the ones in the
question. Even if the question is transformed to
a more advanced representation than a simple list
of keywords, given that the QA systems rely on
search engines, it is necessary to produce a list
of keywords which are used to query the search
engine. The more advanced form is used by the
answer extraction module to locate the answer.
At present, our system extracts only keywords
from the question. These keywords are expanded
with semantically related words in the way
presented in Section 3.3. Currently, we
are considering using partial parsing trees for
representing the structure of the question in a
manner similar to (Buchholz and Daelemans,
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.99827">
139
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.983483083333333">
2001). Unfortunately, to the best of our
knowledge, there are no partial parsers for
Romanian, so if such a method is to be tried, we
will have to implement a partial parser first.
Another role of the question processor is to
identify the type of the answer required by a
question. Usually patterns are used to recognise
this type. After analysing questions produced
by experts, we compiled a list of patterns which
trigger certain types of answers. Some of these
patterns are presented in the Table 1.
A list of text snippets which could contain
the answer to the asked question is obtained
by querying a search engine with the keywords
produced by the question processor. In our
research, we use the ht://Digi , a tool which can be
used to index and search medium size collections
of documents and which behaves in a similar way
with most of the search engines.
The document processor applies different
NLP techniques to the extracted snippets. These
techniques range from simple part of speech
tagging to advanced ones such as coreference
resolution and word sense disambiguation. One
of the modules which are essential for any QA
system is the named entity recogniser. Its role is to
ensure that the extracted answer contains the type
of entity required by the question.
In some cases the document processor reorders
the snippets on the basis of the words contained
in them. Pasca and Harabagiu (2001) show that
such an approach has significant influence on the
overall performance of the QA systems.
The answer extraction module locates the
required answer in the list of text snippets
extracted by the search engine, taking into
consideration several factors. First, the answer
has to contain an entity of the type specified in
the question. Other factors which are considered
when a text snippet is selected as containing the
answer are the distribution of the keywords in the
snippet and their frequency. In most cases, in
addition to the keywords contained in the query,
semantic variations and coreferential words are
used to compute these statistics. The TF-IDF
scores of the keywords are also employed to
&apos;Available at: http://www.htdig.org
determine the relevant answer.

3 Problems
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999926285714286">
In the previous section, we showed that the QA
systems usually rely on a large number of NLP
tools in order to achieve their goals. For less
researched languages, such as Romanian, these
tools are not available. In this section, we
show how we addressed the problem of lack of
resources.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998772">
3.1 The data
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999908">
The open-domain question answering systems
usually operate on the Web or on large
collections of data which are meant to replace
it. Unfortunately, the number of web pages in
Romanian is quite negligible in comparison with
the ones in English. Several search engines allow
to retrieve only pages in a language which is
specified, but their results are not always reliable.
In light of this, we decided that in the initial stages
of the project, we should locate the answers in
a collection of documents available on a local
machine. Our collection consists of newspaper
articles published in two Romanian newspapers
(Evenimentul Zilei2 and Adevarul3). The articles
were automatically downloaded and converted
to plain text format. At present the collection
of documents totalises over 12mil. words. In
later stages of the project, we intend to try the
system on the Web, even though this could raise
additional problems.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99847">
3.2 The search engine
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999972375">
In order to make the future transition from our
local collection to the Web, we needed to use a
search engine which operates in a very similar
manner with those which index the Web. As
already mentioned, we use the freely available
ht://dig tool. An advantage of using this tool, is
that we can control the properties of the retrieved
text snippets (e.g. length).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999746">
3.3 Using ontologies

are ontologies, such as WordNet. The version

for Romanian WordNet is currently in the early
stages of development, so we had to find a way to
replace it. Given that we did not have the resources
to build an ontology by hand, we decided to
use unsupervised methods which cluster words
together according to the context in which they
appear. The clusters indicate that the words are
semantically related.
Two clustering algorithms have been
implemented and tested. The first one is a
non-hierarchical clustering which starts with
several random clusters which are, then, refined.
The second clustering algorithm is a bottom-up
hierarchical clustering algorithm. Evaluation of
the results showed that the hierarchical algorithm
is more accurate for the task (Tatar and Serban,
2003). Figure 1 shows few of the clusters we
obtained.

3.4 Named entity recognition
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999985117647059">
The task of named entity recognisers is to
identify phrases which refer to people, places,
organisations, etc. As with many other fields,
most of the available tools are for English,
but the CoNLL02 shared task (Tjong Kim
Sang, 2002) has shown that it is possible
to use machine learning approaches to design
named entity recognisers for languages other
than English. However, these approaches need
annotated corpora to learn how to identify the
named entity.
Named entities in more than 100 articles were
marked using our multi-purpose annotation too1.4
These files will be used to train several machine
learning algorithms which identify the named
entities, and the best performing one will be
included in the QA system.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.975045">
3.5 Other tools we used
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999875625">
In addition to the tools and resources previously
enumerated, we had to develop some basic tools
which one expects to find in any language.
All our attempts to locate a tokenizer and a
stemmer failed. A large number of tools and
resources were developed by the Multext Project,
but unfortunately they are no longer available.
Even though the development of these tools is
not difficult, we want to emphasise that when
beginning such a project for Romanian, it is
necessary to start with very simple resources and
tools.
We also used the TnT part-of-speech tagger
(Brants, 2000) with the language models for
Romanian described in (Tufis, 2000) to tag the
questions and the text snippets.

replaced missing components with knowledge
poor methods. For each of them several alternative
algorithms will be implemented and the best
performing combination will be included in the
final system. As a result of this project several
tools for Romanian will be developed.
As can be noticed, the structure of our QA
system is the same as any English QA system.
One question which we will try to answer in
this project is how much the QA systems are
language dependent. We will investigate what
kind of components are required for the Romanian
language, in addition to those included in English
systems.
Given the nature of the Romanian language,
we expect that some of the components will
perform better than their equivalents for English
and that they will provide more information. For
example, if a coreference resolver will be included
in the system, we expect to be able to obtain
high accuracy thanks to the stricter agreement in
Romanian.
When all the components will be fully
implemented, the system will be evaluated using
the TREC methodology. In order to evaluate the
system we asked experts to read the newspaper
articles and propose factual questions which can
be answered using short texts from the articles.
In addition to the human directed evaluation, we
are planning to have also automatic evaluation.
For this reason we asked our experts not only to
propose questions, but also to indicate which is the
expected answered.

5 Concluding remarks
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999958">
In this paper, we presented an ongoing project
which develops a question answering system for
Romanian. Even though the structure of our
system does not bring new features, its novelty
consists in the fact that this is the first QA system
for Romanian. The existing gaps in the list
of available resources for Romanian were filled
in by employing knowledge-poor methods which
require little or no training data.
The explanation of the title &amp;quot;How to build a QA
system in your back-garden&amp;quot; is that should this
project be successful, it will provide not only a QA
system for Romanian but it will also prove that it
is possible to develop QA systems for less studied
languages without the need of many resources.

All our attempts to locate a tokenizer and a stemmer failed. A large number of tools and resources were developed by the Multext Project, but unfortunately they are no longer available. Even though the development of these tools is not difficult, we want to emphasise that when beginning such a project for Romanian, it is necessary to start with very simple resources and tools. We also used the TnT part-of-speech tagger (Brants, 2000) with the language models for Romanian described in (Tufis, 2000) to tag the questions and the text snippets. 4 Discussion In the previous sections, we showed the structure of our question answering system and how we 4Available at: http://c1g.w1v.ac.uldprojects/PAL1nkA/ 5http://www.lpl.univ-aix.fr/projects/multext 141 replaced missing components with knowledge poor methods. For each of them several alternative algorithms will be implemented and the best performing combination will be included in the final system. As a result of this project several tools for Romanian will be developed. As can be noticed, the structure of our QA system is the same as any Eng</context>

These conferences are designed to evaluate the state-of-the-art in text retrieval and allow the participants to evaluate their systems in a consistent way by providing them a common test set. Starting with TREC-8, in 1999, these conferences contain a question answering track in which the participants try to find the answer to questions in a large collection of texts. As a result of the TREC, the QA field witnessed rapid development for English, but there are only few systems which work for languages other than English (Kim and Seo, 2002; Vetulani, 2002). Another factor which slows down the development of QA systems for other languages than English is the lack of the modules which are normally used in a QA system. In this paper, we discuss the challenges we have to face during the development of a question answering system for Romanian language. This paper is structured as follows: In Section 2, we present the structure of our QA system. The problems which need to be tackled when it is implemented for Romanian are presented in Section 3. A discussion of the project is presented in Section 4, the article finishing with conclusions. 2 The struc</context>
