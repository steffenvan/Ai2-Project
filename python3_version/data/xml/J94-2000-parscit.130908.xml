Editor&apos;s Note
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998276214285714">
This issue of Computational Linguistics marks the end of James Allen&apos;s long years of
service as editor of the journal. James&apos; first issue of Computational Linguistics was the
January—March issue of 1983. His last issue was the March issue of 1993. In the ten
intervening years, under James&apos; leadership, and with the important support of Don
Walker, late Secretary/Treasurer of the Association for Computational Linguistics and
Managing Editor of CL, this journal has become the leading publication in its field.
The ACL owes a great debt to both James and Don for establishing and maintaining
high standards of scholarship for the journal; for making it increasingly sensitive to
new trends in computational linguistics, without sacrificing appreciation for more tra-
ditional areas of research; and for seeking to make it a more international publication,
in terms of its readership, its editorial board, and the manuscripts it publishes. To
James, we say thank you for a job excellently done; in Don&apos;s memory, we will strive to
maintain his vision of Computational Linguistics as the scholarly home of computational
linguists everywhere.
