<bodyText confidence="0.999737818181818">
We demonstrate an information credibility
analysis system called WISDOM. The purpose
of WISDOM is to evaluate the credibility of in-
formation available on the Web from multiple
viewpoints. WISDOM considers the following
to be the source of information credibility: in-
formation contents, information senders, and
information appearances. We aim at analyzing
and organizing these measures on the basis of
semantics-oriented natural language processing
(NLP) techniques.

1. Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997725625">
As computers and computer networks become
increasingly sophisticated, a vast amount of in-
formation and knowledge has been accumulated
and circulated on the Web. They provide people
with options regarding their daily lives and are
starting to have a strong influence on govern-
mental policies and business management. How-
ever, a crucial problem is that the information
available on the Web is not necessarily credible.
It is actually very difficult for human beings to
judge the credibility of the information and even
more difficult for computers. However, comput-
ers can be used to develop a system that collects,
organizes, and relativises information and helps
human beings view information from several
viewpoints and judge the credibility of the in-
formation.
Information organization is a promising en-
deavor in the area of next-generation Web search.
The search engine Clusty provides a search result
clustering1, and Cuil classifies a search result on
the basis of query-related terms2. The persuasive
technology research project at Stanford Universi-
ty discussed how websites can be designed to
influence people’s perceptions (B. J. Fogg, 2003).
However, as per our knowledge, no research has
been carried out for supporting the human judg-
ment on information credibility and information
organization systems for this purpose.
In order to support the judgment of informa-
tion credibility, it is necessary to extract the
background, facts, and various opinions and their

distribution for a given topic. For this purpose,
syntactic and discourse structures must be ana-
lyzed, their types and relations must be extracted,
and synonymous and ambiguous expressions
should be handled properly.
Furthermore, it is important to determine the
identity of the information sender and his/her
specialty as criteria for credibility, which require
named entity recognition and total analysis of
documents.
In this paper, we describe an information cre-
dibility analysis system called WISDOM, which
automatically analyzes and organizes the above
aspects on the basis of semantically oriented
NLP techniques. WISDOM currently operates
over 100 million Japanese Web pages.

2. Overview of WISDOM
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993561">
We consider the following three criteria for the
judgment of information credibility.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.99882">
(1) Credibility of information contents,
(2) Credibility of the information sender, and
(3) Credibility estimated from the document
style and superficial characteristics.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999921625">
In order to help people judge the credibility of
information from these viewpoints, we have been
developing an information analysis system called
WISDOM. Figure 1 shows the analysis result of
WISDOM on the analysis topic “Is bio-ethanol
good for the environment?” Figure 2 shows the
system architecture of WISDOM.
Given an analysis topic (query), WISDOM
sends the query to the search engine TSUBAKI
(Shinzato et al., 2008), and TSUBAKI returns a
list of the top N relevant Web pages (N is usually
set to 1000).
Then, those pages are automatically analyzed,
and major and contradictory expressions and eva-
luative expressions are extracted. Furthermore,
the information senders of the Web pages, which
were analyzed beforehand, are collected and the
distribution is calculated.
The WISDOM analysis results can be viewed
from several viewpoints by changing the tabs
using a Web browser. The leftmost tab, “Sum-
mary,” shows the summary of the analysis, with
major phrases and major/contradictory state-
ments first.

By referring to these phrases and statements,
a user can grasp the important issues related to
the topic at a glance. The pie diagram indicates
the distribution of the information sender class
spread over 1000 pages, such as company, indus-
try group, and government. The names of the
information senders of the class can be viewed
by placing the cursor over a class region. The last
bar chart shows the distribution of positive and
negative opinions related to the topic spread over
1000 pages, for all and for each sender class. For
example, with regard to “Bio-ethanol,” we can
see that the number of positive opinions is more
than that of negative opinions, but it is the oppo-
site in the case of some sender classes. Several
display units in the Summary tab are cursor sen-
sitive, providing links to more detailed informa-
tion (e.g., the page list including a major state-

ment, the page list of a sender class, and the page
list containing negative opinions).
The “Search Result” tab shows the search re-
sult by TSUBAKI, i.e., ranking the relevant pag-
es according to the TSUBAKI criteria. The “Ma-
jor/Contradictory Expressions” tab shows the list
of major phrases and major/contradictory state-
ments about the given topic and the list of pages
containing the specified phrase or statement. The
“Opinion” tab shows the analysis result of the
evaluative expressions, classified according to
for/against, like/dislike, merit/demerit, and others,
and it also shows the list of pages containing the
specified type of evaluative expressions. The
“Sender” tab classifies the pages according to the
class of the information sender, for example, a
user can view the pages created only by the gov-
ernment.
Furthermore, the superficial characteristics of
pages called as information appearance are ana-
lyzed beforehand and can be viewed in WIS-
DOM, such as whether or not the contact address
is shown in the page and the privacy policy is on
the page, the volume of advertisements on the
page, the number of images, and the number of
in/out links.
As shown thus far, given an analysis topic,
WISDOM collects and organizes the relevant
information available on the Web and provides
users with multi-faceted views. We believe that
such a system can considerably support the hu-
man judgment of information credibility.

3. Data Infrastructure
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999615">
We usually utilize 100 million Japanese Web
pages as the analysis target. The Web pages have
been converted into the standard formatted Web
data, an XML format. The format includes sever-
al metadata such as URLs, crawl dates, titles, and
in/out links. A text in a page is automatically
segmented into sentences (note that the sentence
boundary is not clear in the original HTML file),
and the analysis results obtained by a morpholog-
ical analyzer, parser, and synonym analyzer are
also stored in the standard format. Furthermore,
the site operator, the page author, and informa-
tion appearance (e.g., contact address, privacy
policy, volume of advertisements, and images)
are automatically analyzed and stored in the
standard format.

4. Extraction of Major Expressions and
</sectionHeader>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.985918">
Their Contradictions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999972307692308">
For the organization of information contents,
WISDOM extracts and presents the major ex-
pressions and their contradictions on a given
analysis topic (Kawahara et al., 2008). Major
expressions are defined as expressions occurring
at a high frequency in the set of Web pages on
the analysis topic. They are classified into two:
noun phrases and predicate-argument structures
(statements). Contradictions are the predicate-
argument structures that contradict the major ex-
pressions. For the Japanese phrase yutori kyouiku
(cram-free education), for example, tsumekomi
kyouiku (cramming education) and ikiru chikara
(life skills) are extracted as the major noun
phrases; yutori kyouiku-wo minaosu (reexamine
cram-free education) and gakuryokuga teika-suru
(scholastic ability deteriorates), as the major pre-
dicate-argument structures; and gakuryoku-ga
koujousuru (scholastic ability ameliorates), as its
contradiction. This kind of summarized informa-
tion enables a user to grasp the facts and argu-
ments on the analysis topic available on the Web.
We use 1000 Web pages for a topic retrieved
from the search engine TSUBAKI. Our method
of extracting major expressions and their contra-
dictions consists of the following steps:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.809718">
1. Extracting candidates of major expressions:
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999967125">
The candidates of major expressions are ex-
tracted from each Web page in the search result.
From the relevant sentences to the analysis topic
that consist of approximately 15 sentences se-
lected from each Web page, compound nouns,
parenthetical expressions, and predicate-
argument structures are extracted as the candi-
dates of the major expressions.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.428381" genericHeader="method">
2. Distilling major expressions:
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999954315789474">
Simply presenting expressions at a high fre-
quency is not always information of high quality.
This is because scattering synonymous expres-
sions such as karikyuramu (curriculum) and
kyouiku katei (course of study) and entailing ex-
pressions such as IWC and IWC soukai (IWC
plenary session), all of which occur frequently,
hamper the understanding process of users. Fur-
ther, synonymous predicate-argument structures
such as gakuryoku-ga teika-suru (scholastic
ability deteriorates) and gakuryoku-ga sagaru
(scholastic ability lowers) have the same problem.
To overcome this problem, we distill major ex-
pressions by merging spelling variations with
morphological analysis, merging synonymous
expressions automatically acquired from an ordi-
nary dictionary and the Web, and merging ex-
pressions that can be entailed by another expres-
sion.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.644578">
3. Extracting contradictory expressions:
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.996518833333333">
Predicate-argument structures that negate the
predicate of major ones and that replace the pre-
dicate of major ones with its antonym are ex-
tracted as contradictions. For example, gakuryo-
ku-ga teika-shi-nai (scholastic ability does not
deteriorate) and gakuryokuga koujou-suru (scho-
lastic ability ameliorates) are extracted as the
contradictions to gakuryoku-ga teikasuru (scho-
lastic ability deteriorates). This process is per-
formed using an antonym lexicon, which consists
of approximately 2000 pairs; these pairs are ex-
tracted from an ordinary dictionary.

The extraction and classification of evaluative
information from texts are important tasks with

many applications and they have been actively
studied recently (Pang and Lee, 2008). Most pre-
vious studies on opinion extraction or sentiment
analysis deal with only subjective and explicit
expressions. For example, Japanese sentences
such as watashi-wa apple-ga sukida (I like ap-
ples) and kono seido-ni hantaida (I oppose the
system) contain evaluative expressions that are
directly expressed with subjective expressions.
However, sentences such as kono shokuhin-wa
kou-gan-kouka-ga aru (this food has an anti-
cancer effect) and kono camera-wa katte 3-ka-de
kowareta (this camera was broken 3 days after I
bought it) do not contain subjective expressions
but contain negative evaluative expressions.
From the viewpoint of information credibility, it
appears important to deal with a wide variety of
evaluative information including such implicit
evaluative expressions (Nakagawa et al., 2008).
A corpus annotated with evaluative informa-
tion was developed for evaluative information
analysis studies. Fifty topics such as “Bio-
ethanol” and “Pension plan” were chosen. For
each topic, 200 sentences containing the topic
word were collected from the Web to construct
the corpus totaling 10,000 sentences. For each
sentence, annotators judged whether or not the
sentence contained evaluative expressions. When
evaluative expressions were identified, the evalu-
ative expressions, their holders, their sentiment
polarities (positive or negative), and their relev-
ance to the topic were annotated.
We developed an automatic analyzer of evalu-
ative information using the corpus. We per-
formed experiments of sentiment polarity classi-
fication using Support Vector Machines. Word
forms, POS tags, and sentiment polarities from
an evaluative word dictionary of all the words in
evaluative expressions were used as features, and
an accuracy of 83% was obtained. From the error
analysis, we found that it was difficult to classify
domain-specific evaluative expressions; we are
now planning the automatic acquisition of evalu-
ative word dictionaries.

6. Information Sender Analysis
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999197192307692">
The source of information (or information sender)
is one of the important elements when judging the
credibility of information. It is rather easy for human
beings to identify the information sender of a Web
page. When reading a Web page, whether it is deli-
berate or not, we attribute some characteristics to the
information sender and accordingly form our atti-
tudes toward the information. However, the state-of-
the-art search engines do not provide facilities to
organize a vast amount of information on the basis
of the information sender. If we can organize the
information on a topic on the basis of who or what
type the information sender is, it would enable the
user to grasp an overview of the topic or to judge the
credibility of relevant information.
WISDOM automatically identifies the site op-
erators of Web pages and classifies them into
predefined categories of information sender
called information sender class. A site operator
of a Web page is the governing body of a website
on which the page is published. The information
sender class categorizes the information sender
on the basis of axes such as individuals vs. or-
ganizations and profit vs. nonprofit organizations.
The list below shows the categories of informa-
tion sender class.
