Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.9999769375">
We investigate the automatic identification
of negated and speculative statements in
biomedical texts, focusing on the clinical
domain. Our goal is to evaluate the perfor-
mance of simple, Regex-based algorithms
that have the advantage of low compu-
tational cost, simple implementation, and
do not rely on the accurate computation
of deep linguistic features of idiosyncratic
clinical texts. The performance of the
NegEx algorithm with an additional set of
Regex-based rules reveals promising re-
sults (evaluated on the BioScope corpus).
Current and future work focuses on a boot-
strapping algorithm for the discovery of
new rules from unannotated clinical texts.

<bodyText confidence="0.941484648648649">
Finding negated and speculative (hedging) state-
ments is an important subtask for biomedical In-
formation Extraction (IE) systems. The task of
hedge detection is of particular importance in the
sub-genre of clinical texts which tend to avoid un-
qualified negations or assertions.
Negation/Speculation discovery is typically
broken down into two subtasks - discovering the
negation/speculation cue (a phrase or a syntactic
pattern) and establishing its scope. While a num-
ber of cue and scope discovery algorithms have
been developed, high performing systems typi-
cally rely on machine learning and more involved
feature creation. Deep linguistic feature creation
could pose problems, as the idiosyncrasies of clin-
ical texts often confuse off-the-shelf NLP feature
generation tools (e.g. relying on proper punctu-
ation and grammaticality). In addition, computa-
tionally expensive algorithms could pose problems
for high-volume IE systems.
In contrast, simple Regex-based algorithms
have demonstrated larger practical significance as

they offer reasonable performance at a low devel-
opment and computational cost. NegEx1 (Chap-
man et al., 2001), a simple rule-based algorithm
developed for the discovery of negation of findings
and diseases in discharge summaries, has been im-
plemented in a number of BioNLP systems, in-
cluding Metamap2, CaTIES3, and Mayo Clinic’s
Clinical IE System (Savova et al., 2008). In
NegEx, a list of phrases split into subsets are used
to identify cues and their corresponding scopes
(token widows preceding or following the cues).

Negation/Speculation in general English could be
expressed by almost any combination of mor-
phologic, syntactic, semantic, and discourse-level
means. However, the scientific ‘dryness’ of the
biomedical genre and clinical texts in particular,
limits language variability and simplifies the task.
We evaluated the performance of the NegEx al-
gorithm on the BioScope corpus (Szarvas et al.,
2008). BioScope corpus statistics are shown in Ta-
bles 1 and 2.

and hedge detection in clinical texts. Using the
NegEx algorithm and the FlySlip hedging corpus,
without any modifications or additions, we were
able to achieve an impressive F-score of 90.92%
and 86.33% for negation and speculation cue dis-
covery respectively6. We are currently expand-
ing the set of speculation cues using an unan-
notated dataset of clinical texts and a bootstrap-
ping algorithm (Medlock, 2008). The algorithm
is based on the intuition that speculative cues tend
to co-occur and this redundancy could be explored
to probabilistically discover new cues from high-
confidence existing ones. We are also exploring
the discovery of degree of speculativeness (e.g.
very unlikely vs very likely).
While NegEx performed well on the task of
identifying negation scope (F-score 95.18), further
work is needed on the discovery of speculation
scopes (F-score 58.90). As hedging cues require
a more fine-tuned set of rules, in future work we
will evaluate linguistically motivated approaches
(Kilicoglu and Bergler, 2008) for the creation of a
set of surface-level speculation scope rules.

In contrast, simple Regex-based algorithms have demonstrated larger practical significance as Noriko Tomuro DePaul University Chicago, IL USA tomuro@cs.depaul.edu they offer reasonable performance at a low development and computational cost. NegEx1 (Chapman et al., 2001), a simple rule-based algorithm developed for the discovery of negation of findings and diseases in discharge summaries, has been implemented in a number of BioNLP systems, including Metamap2, CaTIES3, and Mayo Clinic’s Clinical IE System (Savova et al., 2008). In NegEx, a list of phrases split into subsets are used to identify cues and their corresponding scopes (token widows preceding or following the cues). 2 Method Negation/Speculation in general English could be expressed by almost any combination of morphologic, syntactic, semantic, and discourse-level means. However, the scientific ‘dryness’ of the biomedical genre and clinical texts in particular, limits language variability and simplifies the task. We evaluated the performance of the NegEx algorithm on the BioScope corpus (Szarvas et al., 2008). BioScope corpus statistics are shown in Tabl</context>
