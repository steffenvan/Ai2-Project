An order form for BACK ISSUES of the journal and for CONFER-
ENCE PROCEEDINGS is included at the end of this issue. The AJCL
was not published during 1979.
ANNUAL DUES are $15 for personal and $30 for institutional
memberships. A joint membership for couples that provides one
subscription is available for $20. The dues payment includes bulk or
surface mailing fees. A membership application form is on the
reverse of the journal order form at the back of this issue.
Instructions for PAYMENTS for dues or publications are included on
the forms appearing at the back of this issue. Remittances should be
made payable to the Association for Computational Linguistics (or
ACL). Those sent to the ACL Secretary-Treasurer should be payable
in US dollars.
Arrangements have been made for dues to be remitted to banks in
Switzerland or Japan. Details are given on the membership applica-
tion form or are available from the ACL Secretary-Treasurer, the ACL

Guidelines for Formatting Submissions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999217615384616">
Manuscripts submitted to COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS should be typed on letter-size
paper (8.5 by 11 inch or A4), double-spaced throughout, including footnotes and references.
The full first name and initial of each author should be provided, followed by the correspond-
ing institutions and complete mailing addresses. Manuscripts must be submitted in English. _
The paper should begin with an informative abstract of approximately 150-250 words. It
should state the objectives of the work, summarize the results, and give the principle conclu-
sions and recommendations. It is preferable that the abstract not be in the first person, and it
should not contain any mathematical notation or cite references. Work planned but not
completed should not appear. Since the abstract will be used to select appropriate referees, it
is essential to make it as informative as possible.
References should be listed alphabetically by author at the end of the paper according to
the following style, where the naming convention is &apos;Surname, Firstname Initial.&apos; and multiple
authors are separated by semicolons, the last one being preceded by &amp;quot;and&amp;quot;:

References in the text should have the form `surname(s) (date)&apos;, for example &amp;quot;Smith and
Jones (1963) show ...&amp;quot;. Alternatively, the complete reference can be enclosed in parentheses,
for example &amp;quot;The system EZPARSE (Smith and Jones 1963) ...&amp;quot;.
Footnotes should be avoided as much as possible. Whenever it does not impede the logic or
readability of the paper, footnote material should be integrated into the text. When necessary,
they should be numbered consecutively from the beginning of the article and appear at the
bottom of the page on which they are referenced.
Notation should be selected so as to simplify the phototypesetting process. Also, figures
should be devised with consideration for whether they would require one column or two
columns in the text. All figures in the final manuscript will be the author&apos;s responsibility. For
initial submission of papers for refereeing, the figures should be integrated into the text as
much as possible, rather than being inserted at the end of the document. Original line draw-
ings must be drawn in black ink on white paper; the lines should be heavy enough to
reproduce well. Photographs should be in black and white on glossy paper. Computer print-
out is not acceptable for figures; any such copy should be redone in a comparable type font.
CL is interested in esploring the use of electronic submission for the final manuscript, for
those able to produce and transmit copy in that form. We are prepared to handle both tape
and network transmissions. For such a submission, it is essential to reduce the problems
entailed in introducing format commands. The easiest situation for our Production Editor at
present is to eliminate all such commands, separating sections that are handled differently by
blank lines. It is, of course, essential to a6company the electronic transmission with a graphic
version that indicates the preferred format. It should be recognized that deviations from
personal preferences may occur in the interest of ensuring a more consistent style for our jour-
nal (see below). Electronic submissions should be sent directly to the Production Editor at the
mailing or net addresses provided on the inside front cover.
In order to have consistant handling of the various text elements in articles appearing in
COMPUTATIONAL LINGUSTICS, the following conventions will be used. Please mark your
manuscript or copy of your paper accordingly. Note that punctuation marks will follow closing
quotation marks unless the punctuation mark is a part of the quoted material.
