Supervised learning methods for WSD yield better
performance than unsupervised methods. Yet the
availability of clean training data for the former is
still a severe challenge. In this paper, we present
an unsupervised bootstrapping approach for WSD
which exploits huge amounts of automatically gen-
erated noisy data for training within a supervised
learning framework. The method is evaluated using
the 29 nouns in the English Lexical Sample task of
SENSEVAL2. Our algorithm does as well as super-
vised algorithms on 31% of this test set, which is an
improvement of 11% (absolute) over state-of-the-art
bootstrapping WSD algorithms. We identify seven
different factors that impact the performance of our
system.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999374088888889">
Supervised Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD)
systems perform better than unsupervised systems.
But lack of training data is a severe bottleneck
for supervised systems due to the extensive la-
bor and cost involved. Indeed, one of the main
goals of the SENSEVAL exercises is to create large
amounts of sense-annotated data for supervised sys-
tems (Kilgarriff&amp;Rosenzweig, 2000). The problem
is even more challenging for languages which pos-
sess scarce computer readable knowledge resources.
In this paper, we investigate the role of large
amounts of noisily sense annotated data obtained
using an unsupervised approach in relieving the data
acquisition bottleneck for the WSD task. We boot-
strap a supervised learning WSD system with an un-
supervised seed set. We use the sense annotated data
produced by Diab’s unsupervised system SALAAM
(Diab&amp;Resnik, 2002; Diab, 2003). SALAAM is a
WSD system that exploits parallel corpora for sense
disambiguation of words in running text. To date,
SALAAM yields the best scores for an unsupervised
system on the SENSEVAL2 English All-Words task
(Diab, 2003). SALAAM is an appealing approach
as it provides automatically sense annotated data in
two languages simultaneously, thereby providing a
multilingual framework for solving the data acquisi-
tion problem. For instance, SALAAM has been used
to bootstrap the WSD process for Arabic as illus-
trated in (Diab, 2004).
In a supervised learning setting, WSD is cast as
a classification problem, where a predefined set of
sense tags constitutes the classes. The ambigu-
ous words in text are assigned one or more of
these classes by a machine learning algorithm based
on some extracted features. This algorithm learns
parameters from explicit associations between the
class and the features, or combination of features,
that characterize it. Therefore, such systems are
very sensitive to the training data, and those data
are, generally, assumed to be as clean as possible.
In this paper, we question that assumption. Can
large amounts of noisily annotated data used in
training be useful within such a learning paradigm
for WSD? What is the nature of the quality-quantity
trade-off in addressing this problem?

To our knowledge, the earliest study of bootstrap-
ping a WSD system with noisy data is by Gale et.
al., (Gale et al. , 1992). Their investigation was lim-
ited in scale to six data items with two senses each
and a bounded number of examples per test item.
Two more recent investigations are by Yarowsky,
(Yarowsky, 1995), and later, Mihalcea, (Mihalcea,
2002). Each of the studies, in turn, addresses the is-
sue of data quantity while maintaining good quality
training examples. Both investigations present algo-
rithms for bootstrapping supervised WSD systems
using clean data based on a dictionary or an onto-
logical resource. The general idea is to start with
a clean initial seed and iteratively increase the seed
size to cover more data.
Yarowsky starts with a few tagged instances to
train a decision list approach. The initial seed is
manually tagged with the correct senses based on
entries in Roget’s Thesaurus. The approach
yields very successful results — 95% — on a hand-
ful of data items.
Mihalcea, on the other hand, bases the bootstrap-
ping approach on a generation algorithm, GenCor
(Mihalcea&amp;Moldovan, 1999). GenCor creates
seeds from monosemous words in WordNet, Sem-
cor data, sense tagged examples from the glosses
of polysemous words in WordNet, and other hand
tagged data if available. This initial seed set is used
for querying the Web for more examples and the re-
trieved contexts are added to the seed corpus. The
words in the contexts of the seed words retrieved are
then disambiguated. The disambiguated contexts
are then used for querying the Web for yet more
examples, and so on. It is an iterative algorithm
that incrementally generates large amounts of sense
tagged data. The words found are restricted to either
part of noun compounds or internal arguments of
verbs. Mihalcea’s supervised learning system is an
instance-based-learning algorithm. In the study, Mi-
halcea compares results yielded by the supervised
learning system trained on the automatically gener-
ated data, GenCor, against the same system trained
on manually annotated data. She reports successful
results on six of the data items tested.

Similar to Mihalcea’s approach, we compare results
obtained by a supervised WSD system for English
using manually sense annotated training examples
against results obtained by the same WSD system
trained on SALAAM sense tagged examples. The
test data is the same, namely, the SENSEVAL 2
English Lexical Sample test set. The supervised
WSD system chosen here is the University of Mary-

window size of .
Grammatical Features: Syntactic tuples such

context of the target word using a dependency
parser, MINIPAR (Lin, 1998).
Each feature extracted is associated with a weight
value. The weight calculation is a variant on the In-
verse Document Frequency (IDF) measure in Infor-

3.2 SALAAM
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.961431933333333">
SALAAM exploits parallel corpora for sense annota-
tion. The key intuition behind SALAAM is that when
words in one language, L1, are translated into the
same word in a second language, L2, then those
L1 words are semantically similar. For example,
when the English — L1 — words bank, brokerage,
mortgage-lender translate into the French — L2 —
word banque in a parallel corpus, where bank is pol-
ysemous, SALAAM discovers that the intended sense
for bank is the financial institution sense, not the
geological formation sense, based on the fact that
it is grouped with brokerage and mortgage-lender.
SALAAM’s algorithm is as follows:
SALAAM expects a word aligned parallel cor-
pus as input;

butions. Throughout this paper, we opt for using the parametric
Pearson correlation rather than KL distance in order to test
statistical significance.
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.995878294117647">
L1 words that translate into the same L2 word
are grouped into clusters;
SALAAM identifies the appropriate senses for
the words in those clusters based on the words
senses’ proximity in WordNet. The word sense
proximity is measured in information theo-
retic terms based on an algorithm by Resnik
(Resnik, 1999);
A sense selection criterion is applied to choose
the appropriate sense label or set of sense la-
bels for each word in the cluster;
The chosen sense tags for the words in the
cluster are propagated back to their respective
contexts in the parallel text. Simultaneously,
SALAAM projects the propagated sense tags for
L1 words onto their L2 corresponding transla-
tions.

Interestingly, two nouns, detention and chair,
yield better performance than , as in-
dicated by the PRs and , respectively. This
is attributed to the fact that SALAAM produces a lot
more correctly annotated training data for these two
words than that provided in the manually annotated
training data for .
Some nouns yield very poor PR values mainly
due to the lack of training contexts, which is the case
for mouth in , for example. Or lack
of coverage of all the senses in the test data such as
for bar and day, or simply errors in the annotation
of the SALAAM-tagged training data.

ceptable PR scores of — the first 16 nouns in

place hand tagging with SALAAM’s unsupervised
tagging if we did so for those items that yield an ac-
ceptable PR score. But the question remains: How
do we predict which training/test items will yield

5.3 Sense Perplexity

This factor is a characteristic of the training data.
Perplexity is . Entropy is measured as fol-
lows:

where is a sense for a polysemous noun and is
the set of all its senses.
Entropy is a measure of confusability in the
senses’ contexts distributions; when the distribution
is relatively uniform, entropy is high. A skew in the
senses’ contexts distributions indicates low entropy,
and accordingly, low perplexity. The lowest possi-
ble perplexity is , corresponding to entropy. A
low sense perplexity is desirable since it facilitates
the discrimination of senses by the learner, there-
fore leading to better classification. In the SALAAM-
tagged training data, for example, bar has the high-
est perplexity value of over its 19 senses, while
day, with 16 senses, has a much lower perplexity of

Surprisingly, we observe nouns with high per-
plexity such as bum (sense perplexity value of )
achieving PR scores of . While nouns with rel-
atively low perplexity values such as grip (sense
perplexity of ) yields a low PR score of .
Moreover, nouns with the same perplexity and sim-
ilar number of senses yield very different PR scores.
For example, examining holiday and child, both
have the same perplexity of and the number
of senses is close, with 6 and 7 senses, respectively,
however, the PR scores are very different; holiday

Furthermore, nature and art have the same perplex-

These observations are further solidified by the

5.4 Semantic Translation Entropy
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998718125">
Semantic translation entropy (STE) (Melamed,
1997) is a special characteristic of the SALAAM-
tagged training data, since the source of evidence
for SALAAM tagging is multilingual translations.
STE measures the amount of translational variation
for an L1 word in L2, in a parallel corpus. STE is
a variant on the entropy measure. STE is expressed
as follows:

where is a translation in the set of possible trans-
lations in L2; and is L1 word.
The probability of a translation is calculated di-
rectly from the alignments of the test nouns and
their corresponding translations via the maximum
likelihood estimate.
Variation in translation is beneficial for SALAAM
tagging, therefore, high STE is a desirable feature.
Correlation between the automatic tagging preci-
sion and STE is expected to be high if SALAAM
has good quality translations and good quality align-
ments. However, this correlation is a low
. Consequently, we observe a low correlation
between STE and PR,
.
Examining the data, the nouns bum, detention,
dyke, stress, and yew exhibit both high STE and high
PR; Moreover, there are several nouns that exhibit
low STE and low PR. But the intriguing items are
those that are inconsistent. For instance, child and
holiday: child has an STE of and comprises 7
senses at a low sense perplexity of , yet yields
a high PR of . As mentioned earlier, low STE
indicates lack of translational variation. In this spe-
cific experimental condition, child is translated as
enfant, enfantile, ni˜no, ni˜no-peque˜no , which are
words that preserve ambiguity in both French and
Spanish. On the other hand, holiday has a relatively
high STE value of , yet results in the lowest PR
of . Consequently, we conclude that STE alone
is not a good direct indicator of PR.

Across the nouns in this study, the correlation be-
tween PerpDiff and PR is . It is advan-
tageous to be as similar as possible to the training
data to guarantee good classification results within
a supervised framework, therefore a low PerpDiff
is desirable. We observe cases with a low PerpDiff
such as holiday (PerpDiff of ), yet the PR is a
low . On the other hand, items such as art have
a relatively high PerpDiff of , but achieves a
high PR of . Accordingly, PerpDiff alone is not
a good indicator of PR.

Sense Distributional Correlation (SDC) results from

5.7 Sense Context Confusability
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998240611111111">
A situation of sense context confusability (SCC)
arises when two senses of a noun are very similar
and are highly uniformly represented in the train-
ing examples. This is an artifact of the fine gran-
ularity of senses in WordNet 1.7pre. Highly simi-
lar senses typically lead to similar usages, therefore
similar contexts, which in a learning framework de-
tract from the learning algorithm’s discriminatory
power.
Upon examining the 29 polysemous nouns in the
training and test sets, we observe that a significant
number of the words have similar senses according
,
,
between SDC and
PR exists for SALAAM-tagged training data and the
test data. Overall, nouns that yield high PR have
high SDC values. However, there are some in-
stances where this strong correlation is not exhib-
ited. For example, circuit and post have relatively
to a manual grouping provided by Palmer, in 2002.9
For example, senses 2 and 3 of nature, meaning trait
and quality, respectively, are considered similar by
the manual grouping. The manual grouping does
not provide total coverage of all the noun senses
in this test set. For instance, it only considers the
homonymic senses 1, 2 and 3 of spade, yet, in the
current test set, spade has 6 senses, due to the exis-
tence of sub senses.
26 of the 29 test items exhibit multiple groupings
based on the manual grouping. Only three nouns,
detention, dyke, spade do not have any sense group-
ings. They all, in turn, achieve high PR scores of
.
There are several nouns that have relatively high
SDC values yet their performance ratios are low
such as post, nation, channel and circuit. For in-
stance, nation has a very high SDC value of ,
a low sense perplexity of — relatively close to
the sense perplexity of the test data — a suffi-
cient number of contexts (4350), yet it yields a PR
of . According to the manual sense grouping,
senses 1 and 3 are similar, and indeed, upon inspec-
tion of the context distributions, we find the bulk
of the senses’ instance examples in the SALAAM-
tagged training data for the condition that yields
this PR in are annotated with ei-
ther sense 1 or sense 3, thereby creating confusable
contexts for the learning algorithm. All the cases
of nouns that achieve high PR and possess sense
groups do not have any SCC in the training data
which strongly suggests that SCC is an important
factor to consider when predicting the PR of a sys-
tem.

We conclude from the above exploration that SDC
and SCC affect PR scores directly. PerpDiff, STE,
and Sense Perplexity, number of senses and number
of contexts seem to have no noticeable direct impact
on the PR.
Based on this observation, we calculate the SDC
values for all the training data used in our experi-
mental conditions for the 29 test items.
Table 3 illustrates the items with the highest SDC
values, in descending order, as yielded from any
of the SALAAM conditions. We use an empirical
cut-off value of for SDC. The SCC values are
reported as a boolean Y/N value, where a Y indi-
cates the presence of a sense confusable context. As

matically predicting a high PR, but it is not suffi-
cient. If we eliminate the items where an SCC ex-
ists, namely, mouth, post, and authority, we are still
left with nation and circuit, where both yield very
low PR scores. nation has the desirable low Per-
pDiff of . The sense annotation tagging pre-
cision of the in this condition which
yields the highest SDC — Spanish UN data with
the for training — is a low and
a low STE value of . This is due to the fact that
both French and Spanish preserve ambiguity in sim-
ilar ways to English which does not make it a good
target word for disambiguation within the SALAAM
framework, given these two languages as sources of
evidence. Accordingly, in this case, STE coupled
with the noisy tagging could have resulted in the
low PR. However, for circuit, the STE value for its
respective condition is a high , but we observe
a relatively high PerpDiff of compared to the
PerpDiff of for the manually annotated data.
Therefore, a combination of high SDC and
nonexistent SCC can reliably predict good PR. But
the other factors still have a role to play in order to
achieve accurate prediction.
It is worth emphasizing that two of the identified
factors are dependent on the test data in this study,
SDC and PerpDiff. One solution to this problem
is to estimate SDC and PerpDiff using a held out
data set that is hand tagged. Such a held out data
set would be considerably smaller than the required
size of a manually tagged training data for a clas-
sical supervised WSD system. Hence, SALAAM-
tagged training data offers a viable solution to the
annotation acquisition bottleneck.

sults to those obtained by the only comparable boot-
strapping approach when tested on the same data

tors that directly and indirectly affect the perfor-
mance of quantified as a performance
ratio, PR. Sense Distribution Correlation (SDC) and
Sense Context Confusability (SCC) have the highest
direct impact on performance ratio, PR. However,
evidence suggests that probably a confluence of all
the different factors leads to the best prediction of
an acceptable PR value. An investigation into the
feasibility of combining these different factors with
the different attributes of the experimental condi-
tions for SALAAM to automatically predict when the
noisy training data can reliably replace manually an-
notated data is a matter of future work.

The method is evaluated using the 29 nouns in the English Lexical Sample task of SENSEVAL2. Our algorithm does as well as supervised algorithms on 31% of this test set, which is an improvement of 11% (absolute) over state-of-the-art bootstrapping WSD algorithms.

STE is expressed as follows: (3) where is a translation in the set of possible translations in L2; and is L1 word. The probability of a translation is calculated directly from the alignments of the test nouns and their corresponding translations via the maximum likelihood estimate. Variation in translation is beneficial </context>

Can large amounts of noisily annotated data used in training be useful within such a learning paradigm for WSD? What is the nature of the quality-quantity trade-off in addressing this problem? 2 Related Work To our knowledge, the earliest study of bootstrapping a WSD system with noisy data is by Gale et. al., (Gale et al. , 1992). Their investigation was limited in scale to six data items with two senses each and a bounded number of examples per test item. Two more recent investigations are by Yarowsky, (Yarowsky, 1995), and later, Mihalcea, (Mihalcea, 2002). Each of the studies, in turn, addresses the issue of data quantity while maintaining good quality training examples. Both investigations present algorithms for bootstrapping supervised WSD systems using clean data based on a dictionary or an ontological resource. The general idea is to start with a clean initial seed and iteratively increase the seed size to cover more data. Yarowsky starts with a few tagged instances to train a decision list approach. The initial seed is manually tagged with the correct senses based on entries in Roget’s Thesaurus. The approach yields very successful result</context>

Throughout this paper, we opt for using the parametric Pearson correlation rather than KL distance in order to test statistical significance. L1 words that translate into the same L2 word are grouped into clusters; SALAAM identifies the appropriate senses for the words in those clusters based on the words senses’ proximity in WordNet. The word sense proximity is measured in information theoretic terms based on an algorithm by Resnik (Resnik, 1999); A sense selection criterion is applied to choose the appropriate sense label or set of sense labels for each word in the cluster; The chosen sense tags for the words in the cluster are propagated back to their respective contexts in the parallel text. Simultaneously, SALAAM projects the propagated sense tags for L1 words onto their L2 corresponding translations. 3.2.1 Automatically Generated SALAAM Training Data Three sets of SALAAM tagged training corpora are created: SV2LS TR: English SENSEVAL2 Lexical Sample trial and training corpora with no manual annotations.
