Verbmobil is a project sponsored by the Ger-
man government, whose aim is to develop
a translation system for face-to-face speech
dialogue. This book is the report on a pre-
liminary study of the project conducted by
CSLL Stanford University.
The contents of the book are as follows:
Chapter 1 contains introductory material;
Chapter 2 and Chapter 3 are devoted to de-
scribing the current state-of-the-art of ma-
chine translation and speech recognition and
speech synthesis technologies, respectively;
and Chapter 4 reports a technical recommen-
dation for the Verbmobil project based on the
discussions in the preceding chapters.
Chapter 2, which would be the most inter-
esting for readers of Computational Linguis-
tics, exhaustively covers various aspects of
machine translation. First, the authors argue
why machine translation is so difficult. They
discuss the indeterminacy of language by re-
ferring to a number of examples: situated-
ness, mismatches between two languages in
translation, and ambiguities of various lev-
els. From these considerations, they suggest
that good translation is not defined as pre-
serving the meaning but as preserving the
intention of the original (p. 27), sometimes by
adding or deleting information (p. 26). Then,
they review current technologies, historical
perspectives, and theoretical issues such as
syntax and grammar formalism. The most
interesting and important discussion in this
chapter is the section &amp;quot;Translation Strategy.&amp;quot;
First, the authors refer to the controversial ar-
gument concerning the comparison between
the transfer approach and the interlingual
approach, but they claim that &amp;quot;the issue of
interest is not whether to pursue a transfer or
an interlingual approach; the issue is which
levels of analysis are necessary, and how to
arrive at a representation suitable for gener-
ation of a target text&amp;quot; (p. 82).
From this point, and by considering many
examples of translation mismatch that imply
the impossibility of a naive interlingual scheme,
the authors propose a new architecture called
&amp;quot;translation by negotiation.&amp;quot; In this architec-
ture, some interlingual representation is still
supposed, but it does not require that an in-
variant representation that will be the same
for the translation of a source sentence, or
text, into any other language can be found at
any time. There are three components: an an-
alyzer, a generator, and a negotiator. The an-
alyzer delivers to the negotiator an interlin-
gual representation. The negotiator hands the
interlingual representation to the generator.
In some (or rare) cases, the generator can find
the phrase in the target language that has ex-
actly the same interlingual representation. In
other cases, the generator reports to the ne-
gotiator error information such as the over-
specification or underspecification of the in-
put interlingual representation. Now, it is up
to the negotiator to decide whether the error
is fatal or not. When it is not so serious, the
translation is accepted, but when it is serious,
the negotiator has to solve it by some other
means, such as referring to the context. In
Chapter 2, the authors also discuss other top-
ics: an overview of nonlinguistic translation
approaches such as the stochastic approach
and the example-based approach, and a com-
prehensive survey of current machine trans-
lation systems. These would also be quite in-
formative to a reader.
Chapter 3 is devoted to introducing
speech-recognition technology and speech-
synthesis technology, and Chapter 4 contains
recommendations for the Verbmobil project.
These might be less interesting for a reader
of Computational Linguistics, so only a brief
description is given below.
In Chapter 3, general characteristics of
speech are given, and current major speech-
recognition technologies (the knowledge-
based approach, the stochastic-based [HMM-
based] approach, and the connectionism-
based approach) are introduced, as well as
a traditional template-based approach. These
descriptions would be a good introduction
for a reader who wants to see a general
overview of speech-recognition technologies.
As for speech synthesis, most pages are given

to prosody processing and voice conversion.
Most of Chapter 4 consists of technical and
planning recommendations for the project.
However, the discussion of target domains
would be informative to those researchers
who are interested in the corpus-based ap-
proach.
As the authors pointed out, this book is not
a feasibility study, and unfortunately, there
is only a little description of those technolo-
gies, such as contextual processing or inte-
gration of speech and language processing,
that are some of the key technologies for
speech translation. However, this book is un-
doubtedly of value not only to students who
want to study machine translation or speech
recognition, but also to all researchers who
are engaged in machine translation or natu-
ral language processing.—Tsuyoshi Morimoto,

For several weeks, The Encyclopedia of Lan-
guage and Linguistics has sat heavily in its box
on the floor of my office; I couldn&apos;t find space
for it anywhere else. I wasn&apos;t supposed to be
reviewing it myself (as I contributed a cou-
ple of the articles in it), but I never stopped
using it myself long enough to send it out
to anyone else. Since it arrived, it has been
used as an oracle whenever a linguistic ques-
tion arose that I couldn&apos;t answer from my
own knowledge—which is not infrequent, as,
like many in computational linguistics, my
formal training is heavily computational and
only moderately linguistic—and for brows-
ing as a guilt-free diversion from any work
that I should have been doing but didn&apos;t want
to.
Conclusion: Everyone who is a linguist of
any flavor at all should have a copy of this
encyclopedia.
In its sheer size and comprehensiveness,
The Encyclopedia of Language and Linguistics—
hereafter, ELL—completely eclipses its main
rival, Oxford University Press&apos;s International
Encyclopedia of Linguistics (Bright 1992). Ta-
ble 1 compares the two works on basic objec-
tive data. Table 2 demonstrates the breadth of
coverage by listing a random sample of arti-
cles. (I&apos;ve listed the first thirty-odd signed ar-
ticles from Volume 5, where McLuhan, Marx,
magic, and marketing all meet. I have not
included a number of short, unsigned para-
graph-length articles, mostly on the language
situation in various places.)
The articles are divided into 33 subject ar-
eas, each under a separate editor. There are
even quite a number of articles on compu-
tational linguistics (edited by C. S. Mellish,
University of Edinburgh), but they are less
likely to be useful to serious readers of this
journal; after all, one uses a work like the ELL
primarily as a reference upon, or entry point
to, the areas of linguistics that are beyond
one&apos;s regular area of study or expertise.
Of course, in a work as large as this, it is
inevitable that there will be a few disappoint-
ments and misjudgments. For example, the
article on the Summer Institute of Linguis-
tics, which is nearly five encyclopedia pages
long, is written in the style of a prospectus
(&amp;quot;The Summer Institute of Linguistics began
modestly enough in 1934 ... &amp;quot;), omitting any
mention of the controversies over the ethics
of the Institute&apos;s activities in Latin America.
Unfortunately, given the ELL&apos;s price of
nearly $3000 a set, most linguists will have
to resort to using a copy in their local library
(which will have used its entire year&apos;s acqui-
sition budget for linguistics books in order to
buy it). That&apos;s a pity, as much of the value of
the work is realized only when it is ready-to-
hand.—Graeme Hirst, University of Toronto
