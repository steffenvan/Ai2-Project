This volume contains the papers presented at the 28th Annual Meeting of the Association for
Computational Linguistics.
Every year it seems that the task of picking the best papers out of hundreds of exciting and new
papers becomes more and more difficult. As a community, we should thank all these authors who
submitted papers of such high quality, whether their papers were accepted or not, for it is they who make
the meeting possible and set its high standards.
Of course, that means that we are indebted more than ever to the members of the Program
Committee. They deserve our deepest thanks for the Herculean task of reading and carefully reviewing a
near-record number of papers: David Israel, SRI International; Karen Jensen, IBM Corporation; Aravind

Kudos go to Rich Thomason of the University of Pittsburgh for acting as the local arrangements
coordinator and his staff assistant Stefni Agin; to Dan Flickinger for putting together a most interesting
set of tutorials; to Johanna Moore who made demonstrations and and exhibits possible; and to my own
staff assistant Rhonda Byrne for keeping the program committee&apos;s business running smoothly. A special
tip-of-the-hat to the managers of MIT&apos;s air conditioning, who kept the program committee running on
schedule.
Our invited speakers always add a special sparkle to our meetings, so I would like to personally
applaud Lila Gleitman from the University of Pennsylvania and Fred Jelinek from the IBM TJ. Watson
Research Center.
Learning is also an important part of our annual meetings, so I also thank the individual instructors
for our tutorial sessions: Per-Kristian Halvorsen and John Nerbonne; Terry Langendoen and Mitch
Marcus; Irene Heim; and David Rumelhart. Mark Liberman deserves special appreciation for his report
on the ACL Data Collection Initiative.
Last on this list of thanks, but first in our hearts and minds, is Don Walker. Together with Betty
Walker, he is truly the &amp;quot;glue&amp;quot; that makes the Association for Computational Linguistics stick together.
He does everything from soup to nuts for our Association, and particularly for the conferences, from
putting out the Call for Papers, to answering every little question, to publishing the Proceedings. All
done selflessly, aside from this meagre reward at the front of each year&apos;s Proceedings. We should all
think of how much he has done for all of us and the field as a whole.

Unification in the Syntax/Semantics Interface
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.956286846153846">
Per-Kristian Halvorsen, Xerox PARC &amp; CSLI, and John Nerbonne, Hewlett-Packard &amp; CSLI
The introduction of unification-based formalisms for linguistic description has had a major impact on syntactic
processing techniques and even on syntactic theory, especially in the development of feature-based grammars.
More recently the use of unification has found success in semantic processing, raising anew some central issues
concerning the syntax/semantics interface (e.g. compositionality and the virtues of &amp;quot;direct&amp;quot; interpretation). The
tutorial will present the basic techniques underlying the use of unification in semantic processing, and demonstrate
how these are profitably extended. Major topics are (i) Compositionality and systematicity in semantic
interpretation revisited from the perspective of unification grammars; (ii) Structure-sharing, the ability to cater to the
information shared in linguistic signs, employed not only in logic translations, but also in ancillary information
associated with interrogative, relative, anaphoric and reflexive pronouns; (iii) Exploitation of the ability to
underspecify information as an attractive option to multiplying semantics analyses in treating ambiguities; (iv) New
ways of integrating semantic and syntactic constraints provided by a unitary basis for processing both semantic and
syntactic information.

Tagging Linguistic Information in a Text Corpus
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.958697714285714">
Terry Langendoen, University of Arizona, and Mitch Marcus, University of Pennsylvania
Within the next few months, the widespread availability of extremely large corpora of computer readable texts
through the ACL Data Collection Initiative will provide a new research tool for both linguistics and computational
linguistics. Work is also beginning on explicit annotation of large corpora with several aspects of linguistic
structure. This tutorial is intended for those who wish either to engage in text annotation projects of their own, or to
exploit the availibility of new large annotated text and transcribed speech corpora such as the Penn Treebank. We
will discuss at length a proposed set of draft standards developed by the internationally sponsored Text Encoding
Initiative for the encoding and interchange of phonological, morphological and syntactic information, focussing
both on the issues involved in developing such standards and on the particulars of the present proposed standard.
We will outline a set of general design issues for large corpus annotation efforts, with focus on achieving the
productivity rates necessary to annotate millions of words of text. The particular schemes used within the Penn
Treebank project will be presented. We will also briefly survey a range of recent results deriving from the use of
both annotated and unannotated corpora as research tools, using statistical, information-theoretic, and classical-AI
symbolic methodologies.

Discourse Representation Theory
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9347914">
Irene Heim, Massachusetts Institute of Technology
Discourse Representation Theory (DRT) refers to a semantic analysis of indefinites and anaphora advanced by
Kamp (1981) and Heim (1982) and to modifications and extensions thereof in subsequent work by various authors.
Like any concrete piece of linguistic analysis, DRT is a package deal and eclectically incorporates several ideas and
assumptions that have been around in the philosophy and linguistics literature for a while and will probably continue
to be explored long after DRT is obsolete. The main goal of this tutorial is not just to show how the DRT analysis
works, but to isolate the distinct items in the &apos;package&apos; and clarify the role of each within DRT as well as in the
broader context of semantic theory. We will specifically attend to aspects of the following general issues: the
syntax-semantics interface; context-dependency and presupposition; and the syntax and semantics of natural
language quantification structures.

Connectionist Approaches to Language
David Rumelhart, Stanford University
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.85340175">
This tutorial will provide an overview and introduction to connectionist techniques and their applications to
linguistic information processing. I will discuss issues of learning and computation via constraint satisfaction, and
will illustrate the applications of these to language processing problems.
