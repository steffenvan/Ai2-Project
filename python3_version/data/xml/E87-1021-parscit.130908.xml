INTRODUCTION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994581769230769">
In mid-1985, a project of machine
translation of Czech computer manuals
into Russian was started, thus
constituting a second MT project of the
group of mathematical linguistics at
Charles University (for a full
description of the first project, see
(Kirschner, 1982) and (Kirschner, in
press)).
Our goals are both practical
(translation or re-translation of new or
re-edited manuals for export purposes
within the COMECON countries, of an
estimated amount of 500 to 1000 pages a
year) and theoretical (we wish to verify
our approach to the analysis of Czech
and to develop a theoretical background
for translation between closely related
languages such as Czech and Russian).
The project is carried out by NItMS,
Prague (Research Institute for Computing
Machinery) at the Department of Software
in cooperation with the Department of
Mathematical Linguistics, Faculty of
Mathematics and Physics, Charles
University, Prague.
Input texts
The texts our system should translate
are software manuals to VtMS-developed
DOS-4 operating system which is an
advanced extension to the common DOS.
The texts are currently maintained on
tapes under the editing and formatting
system PES (Programmed Editing System).
This system allows for preparation,
editing and binding-ready printout using
national printer chain(s). Texts are
stored on tapes using an internal format
containing upper/lowercase letters,
editing &amp; formatting commands, version
number/identification, info on
last-changed pages etc.; most of this
can be used to improve the overall
translation quality. On the other hand,
part of it is somewhat confusing and
must be handled carefully.
By now, we have access to 65 manuals
on tapes, containing about 12.000 pages
(approx. 1.500.000 running words
53.000 different word fomrs). The
complete documentation covers 78 manuals
and is still growing.

The overall structure
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.97439169117647">
RUSLAN is a unidirectional system
dealing with one pair of languages (SL -
Czech, TL - Russian). We adopt a
transfer-like translation scheme (in the
sense we do not use any intermediate
pilot language), but with many
simplifications due to the close
relationship between Czech and Russian,
so that it belongs to the so-called
direct method (in the sense of (Slocum,
1985)).
The translation process itself is to
be carried out in batch (we have to
respect the hardware available). This
means that no human intervention is
possible during the process.
Nevertheless, our aim is to obtain
high-quality results which would require
usual post-editing only. No human
pre-editing is contained in the system
design.
The translation unit is constituted
by a single sentence. Thus, the
recognition of sentence boundaries is a
part of the preprocessing.
For the time being, a treatment of
ellipsis is not provided for, but a
modification of the analysis is being
prepared to account for cases (not very
frequent in the translated manuals)
where information necessary for an
appropriate translation should be looked
for in the previous sentence(s).
Translation steps
RUSLAN performs following steps to
obtain the translation of a given (part
of a) manual:
(1) The text is &amp;quot;punched&amp;quot; from a tape,
to &amp;quot;visualize&amp;quot; all embedded editing
&amp; formatting commands;
(2) Fully automatic preprocessing
follows, which includes:
- national &amp; special characters
conversion &amp; coding
- sentence boundaries recognition
(3) The Czech morphological analysis
(MA) is performed, followed by
(4) the syntactico-semantic analysis
(SSA) with respect to Russian
sentence structure, for each input
sentence separately.
(5) The representation obtained in the
previous step is converted into
Russian surface word list in an
appropriate order simultaneously
performing some TL-dependent
changes.
(6) Then, morphological synthesis of
Russian (MSR) is performed and at
the same time synthesized words are
decoded and put out along with
preserved editing &amp; formatting
commands, and at last
(7) the output is saved onto a tape
under the PES system again.
The resulting text can be then easily
printed and corrected using PES editing
facilities.

Some more details
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.988613375">
Since the overall structure of RUSLAN
does not differ considerably from the
existing MT-systems, we will concentrate
ourselves in our paper on some
interesting details.
ad (1): Getting a text out of the tape
This function is performed by means
of PES &amp;quot;punch&amp;quot; command only. Internally
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.994594">
114
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.990390243902439">
coded words and commands are converted
to card-like character format, so they
can be read easily by other programs.
This step is processed separatelly
because we want to achieve the maximal
hardware and operating system
independence possible.
ad (2): Preprocessing
True words and punctuation are
recognized and coded using alphanumeric
characters only. Special characters
(such as /, +, =, greek chars, etc.)
and PES-commands are coded similarly,
but they are handled as word attributes
rather than as separate words.
The recognition of sentence
boundaries proved to be the hardest
problem of this stage. We have
developed a special algorithm for
sentence boundaries recognition, which
takes editing commands and punctuation
into consideration, as well as
upper/lowercase letters in special
positions. This algorithm is based on
frames and features. Text is cut
whenever the &amp;quot;End Of Sentence&amp;quot; condition
is met. Such a condition is raised when
one of the features of the next text
element is found in the frame of the
current text element.
Features assigned to each element are
e. g. &amp;quot;beginning of sentence&amp;quot;
unconditional sentence boundary assigned
to some PES commands, or &amp;quot;capitalized&amp;quot; -
this one is assigned to the word
starting with exactly one uppercase
letter. Among other features we use
there are &amp;quot;common word&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;uppercase
only&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;number&amp;quot; and some other
classifying PES commands.
Frames contain &amp;quot;beginning of
sentence&amp;quot; in most cases; a more
complicated situation arises when
evaluating punctuation frames. Frames
for &amp;quot;.&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;;&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;?&amp;quot; are created using
quite complicated algorithms. Clearly,
it is not possible to obtain 100%
correctness without a deeper analysis,
so we prefer (isolated) missing cuts to
incomplete sentences. Tests showed only
one missing cut every 100 pages of
continuous text (introductory manuals),
and every 30-50 pages in reference
manuals; no incomplete sentences
appeared anywhere in the sample. This
looks promising, because missing cuts
result in slowdown of analysis only.
ad (3): Morphological analysis
Since Czech is a highly inflectional
language, this part is a little more
complicated task than a MA for English.
However, in the stage of MA of Czech we
obtain much more useful information for
the syntactico-semantic analysis.
MA is based on pattern unification.
During the MA, the main dictionary is
searched through to find all possible
stems; ambiguities are treated in
parallel during the next phase of
processing.
ad (4): Syntactico-semantic analysis
SSA is the most important part of
RUSLAN. Using Sgall&apos;s FGD as the
theoretical starting point (for the most
recent formulation, see (Sgall et al.,
1986)), the dependency approach and
data-driven parsing are the corner
stones and valency frames are the tools
of SSA. To control the combinatoric
expansion, semantic features are used as
additional constraints to the syntactic
ones (for a more detailed account of
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.998038">
115
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.981795166666667">
SSA, see (Oliva, in prep.)).
The result of SSA is affected by the
TL-syntax - so there is no true separate
transfer component in our system. In
most cases, the need for changes can be
resolved on the basis of the Czech
sentence. A module is being prepared
carrying out some minor restructuring
(necessary e. g. for determining the
word order and some instances of
negation), which will be performed
before the synthesis.
The close relationship between Czech
and Russian helps us to leave many
ambiguities unresolved and to allow the
output to be as ambiguous as the input.
We must resolve such ambiguities that
would create multiple outputs in the TL,
and select only one of them, but this is
the case of only limited number of
sentences.
ad (5): Generation
For the time being, no true
TL-restructuring is being performed.
During the dependency tree
decomposition, morphological information
is transferred from the governor to its
dependent modifications according to
agreement. The original word order is
slightly changed when needed. An
ordered list of words with morphological
information and editing/formatting
attributes restored is the output of
this phase.
ad (6): Morphological synthesis
True words are processed by the MSR
module to obtain their inflected forms.
This module is capable of doing some
word derivation (such as verbal
adjectives). It is also responsible for
orthographical changes (concerning
prepositions and some pronouns) forced
by the adjacent word(s).
After MSR, each word is decoded
(including its attributes) to the
PES-acceptable format and &amp;quot;punched&amp;quot; out.
This is an inverse operation to step
(2).

Handled by PES solely, this is an

Implementation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999643535714286">
All the testing is performed on the
EC-1027 or IBM/370 systems at VUMS
(under DOS-4). The base of the system
(steps 3, 4 and 5) is capable to run
under the OS operating system as well.
Steps 1 and 7 are handled by special
software, which is a part of the DOS-4
operating system. Steps 2 and 6 are
written in standard Pascal (including
the MSR module). Steps 3 to 5 are
programmed in the well-known Q-systems,
implemented through Fortran IV (G or H
level). We use the Q-language compiler
with the kind permission of its original
author, prof. B. Thouin; some marginal
changes were made in the Q-language
interpreter due to the practical needs
of our system. The only noticeable
change is that complete graphs deleted
formerly due to the CUL + DE + SAC
mechanism are passed now (unchanged) to
the next Q-system for further
processing.
Maximal core requirement is estimated
to 640KB (step 3 - dictionary), so it is
possible to use even real-memory based
systems. Secondary storage volume will
be determined mainly by the dictionary

size, since an average entry occupies
1000 bytes for the first operational
version. We suppose that 10.000 entries
will be sufficient for the first
prototype. Dictionary search is
performed using extended hashing scheme
incorporated in the Q-language
interpreter.
Elapsed time needed for translation
depends on hardware and the time sharing
coefficient. First test showed, that
the widely-published speed of 1.5 mipw
will not be exceeded. This converts to
3 sec CPU on our fastest EC-1027
computer, which will clearly suffice to
translate up to the desired 50 pages a
day.

Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999955304347826">
In March 1987, steps 1, 2, 3 and 7
are fully developed and implemented,
step 6 is implemented partially
(morphological synthesis of Russian); it
will be finished in mid-87. Steps 4 and
5 are under development. They have been
separately tested since last summer, the
manual on General Description of DOS-4
being the testing material. Translation
of the first three pages is available
now (performed by steps 3, 4 and 5).
Simultaneously, dictionary entries (cca
7500 for the first, 87 version) are
being prepared by external co-workers.
By the end of 1987, all steps (1) to
(7) should be tested continuously at
STNS. By the end of 88, RUSLAN should
be able to translate existing manuals in
quality worth postediting. When
finished (1990), it should translate new
software manuals in quality not
requiring more postediting than human
translations.
