identifies types of verbs which remain outside the
area: statals, e.g. &apos;know&apos;, and punctuals, e.g. &apos;find&apos;.
The basic problem then concerns what he calls
&amp;quot;processives.&amp;quot; These he analyzes more precisely,
chiefly with examples from Gothic but also with refer-
ence to Greek and English, in a treatment too detailed
for presentation in the space allotted here. Since,
however, the analysis of verbs in a grammar is of fun-
damental importance, especially in computational lin-
guistics and artificial intelligence with their heavy reli-
ance on case theory, Lloyd&apos;s article will repay careful
study by readers of this journal. His proposed longer
work following the &amp;quot;prolegomena&amp;quot; may also be kept in
mind.
Many other articles not mentioned here are of in-
terest, also, for specialists in computational linguistics.
Anyone teaching a course in grammar testing might,
for example, ask students to program the rules in Jo-
seph B. Voyles&apos;s &amp;quot;The phonology of the Old High
German Tatian&amp;quot; (441-493). Besides testing the com-
pleteness and accuracy of his formalizations, a pro-
grammed phonology would be of no little interest in
presenting forms in the scantily attested early period
of German. The availability in English of an article
&amp;quot;On some linguistic methods&amp;quot; (521-546) on views of
Soviet scholarship by a highly regarded scholar, G.S.
Seur, illustrates a further reason for readers of this
journal not to disregard this volume. One may dis-
agree with some of Rues statements, for example, his
&amp;quot;dissatisfaction with typology, whose chief aim is clas-
sification&amp;quot; (530); actually, typological study of syntax
has provided some of the best means for insights into
the development of language and for explanations,
especially when one moves beyond characteristics like
adjective: noun and genitive: noun, or preposi-
tion:postposition structures. Yet this and many other
articles raise important questions, in a handsome trib-
ute. In lauding a historical linguist, a highly appropri-
ate conclusion is an article on views of a major linguist
concerning the enduring problem of deep and surface
structure: &amp;quot;Quomodo superficiei grammaticae nexus
sensusque profundior in Jespersenii Syntaxi analytica
dicta tractentur&amp;quot; (601-615) by Ladislaus Zgusta.

A special issue of the SIGART Newsletter on Natu-
ral Language Processing is being planned for next
year. The intent of the issue is to provide a survey of
current research activity in Natural Language Process-
ing and Computational Linguistics.
In February of 1977, Dave Waltz prepared a spe-
cial issue of the Newsletter on this subject. People
were asked to send in brief descriptions of their ef-
forts. These notes were assembled and published,
cross-referenced by topic. The result was a tremen-
dously valuable compendium of current work in the
field. Over 4 years have passed since the issue was
published, so it seems appropriate to prepare an updat-
ed version at this time.
Any individual or group that would like to have
their current activities included is invited to submit a
brief summary of their work. Submissions should in-
clude a title, names and affiliations of people involved

proposed projects is welcome, as well as information
about work on languages other than English and from
countries other than the United States. (Submissions

survey of 14000 archival, governmental, and industrial
institutions to determine if they hold records and arti-
facts that document the technical and socio-economic
development of information processing. The survey is
being conducted by mail questionnaire; each institu-
tion is invited to submit general information on ar-
chives or manuscript holdings that contain historical
source materials related to information processing.
Computer corporations and allied industries are re-
quested to provide a brief overview of the types of
computer-related records generated and maintained by
individual companies.
The Institute&apos;s long-range plans also include pub-

Research in computer understanding of natural
language has led to the construction of programs
which can handle a number of different types of lan-
guage, including questions about the contents of data
bases, stories and news articles, dialogues, and scene
descriptions. This research draws on and has in turn
had an affect on many other research areas, including
software engineering, linguistics, psychology, philoso-
phy, and knowledge representation. This paper pro-
vides a brief history and overview of the field, along
with examples and explanations of the operation of
several natural language understanding programs. The
limitations of our current technology are discussed,
and assessments are given of the most promising cur-
rent research directions.

Despite a large amount of research on developing
natural language understanding problems, little work
has been done on evaluating their performance or
potential. The evaluations that have been done have
been unsystematic and incomplete. This has led to
uncertainty and confusion over the accomplishments of
natural language processing research.
The lack of evaluation can be primarily attributed
to the difficulty of the problem. The desired behavior
of natural language processors has not been clearly
specified. Partial progress toward the eventual goals
for natural language processors has not been delineat-
ed, much less measured.
This thesis attempts to clarify some of the difficul-
ties behind evaluating the performance of natural lan-
guage processors. It also proposes an evaluation me-
thod that is designed to be systematic and thorough.
The method relies on considering a natural language
processor from three viewpoints in the light of several
taxonomies of issues relevant to natural language proc-
essing. Finally, an evaluation is described of
PLANES, a natural language database query system.

TUGA is a program which converses in Portuguese
to provide a library service covering the field of Artifi-
cial Intelligence. The objective of designing TUGA
was the development of a feasible method for consult-
ing and creating data bases in natural Portuguese. The
resulting program allows dialogues where the program
and its users behave in the way humans normally do in
a dialogue setting. The program can answer, and
question, in pre-defined scenarios. Users can ques-
tion, answer and issue commands in a natural and
convenient way, without bothering excessively with
the form of the dialogues and sentences.
The original contributions of this work are: the
treatment of dialogues, the adaptation of Colmerauer&apos;s
natural language framework to Portuguese, the partic-
ular method for evaluating the logical structures in-
volved in Colmerauer&apos;s framework, and the library
service application itself. The program is implemented

The basic problem then concerns what he calls &amp;quot;processives.&amp;quot; These he analyzes more precisely, chiefly with examples from Gothic but also with reference to Greek and English, in a treatment too detailed for presentation in the space allotted here. Since, however, the analysis of verbs in a grammar is of fundamental importance, especially in computational linguistics and artificial intelligence with their heavy reliance on case theory, Lloyd&apos;s article will repay careful study by readers of this journal. His proposed longer work following the &amp;quot;prolegomena&amp;quot; may also be kept in mind. Many other articles not mentioned here are of interest, also, for specialists in computational linguistics. Anyone teaching a course in grammar testing might, for example, ask students to program the rules in Joseph B. Voyles&apos;s &amp;quot;The phonology of the Old High Besides testing the completeness and accuracy of his formalizations, a programmed phonology would be of no little interest in presenting forms in the scantily attested early period of German. The availability in English of an article &amp;quot;On some linguistic methods&amp;quot; (521-546) on views of Soviet scholarship by a highly regarded scholar, G.S. Seur, illustrates a further reason for readers of this journal not to disregard this volume. One may disagree with some of Rues statements, for example, his &amp;quot;dissatisfaction with typology, whose chief aim is classification&amp;quot; (530); actually, typological study of syntax has provided some of the best means for insights into the development of language and for explanations, especially when one moves beyond characteristics like adjective: noun and genitive: noun, or preposition:postposition structures. Yet this and many other articles raise important questions, in a handsome tribute. In lauding a historical linguist, a highly appropriate conclusion is an article on views of a major linguist concerning the enduring problem of deep and surface structure: &amp;quot;Quomodo superficiei grammaticae nexus sensusque profundior in Jespersenii Syntaxi analytica dicta tractentur&amp;quot; (601-615) by Ladislaus Zgusta.</abstract>

Special SIGART Issue on Natural Language special issue of the Newsletter Natural Language Processing is being planned for next year. The intent of the issue is to provide a survey of current research activity in Natural Language Processing and Computational Linguistics. In February of 1977, Dave Waltz prepared a speissue of the this subject. People were asked to send in brief descriptions of their efforts. These notes were assembled and published, cross-referenced by topic. The result was a tremendously valuable compendium of current work in the field. Over 4 years have passed since the issue was published, so it seems appropriate to prepare an updated version at this time. Any individual or group that would like to have their current activities included is invited to submit a brief summary of their work. Submissions should include a title, names and affiliations of people involved Journal of Computational Linguistics, Volume 7, Number 2, April-June 1981 The FINITE STRING Newsletter Announcements in the project, and recent or selected bibliographical references. Suggested content would be a summary of the main ideas of the effort, accomplishments, current focus, and future goals. Information about new or proposed projects is welcome, as well as information about work on languages other than English and from countries other than the United States. (Submissions must be written in English, however.) Summaries are limited to 3 double-spaced pages, including references and examples, and should be as brief as possible, avoiding details of representations, techniques and protocols beyond short examples. Long submissions will be subject to editing. Submissions should be sent to the Guest Editor at the address below (via ARPAnet if possible) prior to November 1, 1981.</abstract>

Despite a large amount of research on developing natural language understanding problems, little work has been done on evaluating their performance or potential. The evaluations that have been done have been unsystematic and incomplete. This has led to uncertainty and confusion over the accomplishments of natural language processing research. The lack of evaluation can be primarily attributed to the difficulty of the problem. The desired behavior of natural language processors has not been clearly specified. Partial progress toward the eventual goals for natural language processors has not been delineated, much less measured. This thesis attempts to clarify some of the difficulties behind evaluating the performance of natural language processors. It also proposes an evaluation method that is designed to be systematic and thorough. The method relies on considering a natural language processor from three viewpoints in the light of several of issues relevant to natural language processing. Finally, an evaluation is described PLANES, a natural language database query system.</abstract>

The original contributions of this work are: the treatment of dialogues, the adaptation of Colmerauer&apos;s natural language framework to Portuguese, the particular method for evaluating the logical structures involved in Colmerauer&apos;s framework, and the library service application itself. The program is implemented</abstract>
