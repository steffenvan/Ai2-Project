<construct confidence="0.995190875">
&amp;quot;Instructors looking for a good introductory text to
use in a course devoted to computational linguistics
should consider this book as a strong candidate if
they wish to emphasize a linguistics approach....
The book is interestingly written with many in-
sigh041 discussions, and it is the only (introductory)
computational linguistics textbook that looks at
the field from a linguist&apos;s point of view.&amp;quot;

This book is one of the first volumes to pro-

computerized lexicons for the automatic treat-
ment of natural language, with applications to
machine translation, automatic indexing, and
database front-ends, knowledge extraction,

An exploration of a new approach to text
generation that interprets systemic grammar
as a computational representation. Patten
demonstrates that systemic grammar can be
easily and automatically translated into current
AI-knowledge representations and efficiently
processed by the same knowledge-based tech-
niques currently exploited by expert systems.

characterizes the semiotic nature of computers
and discusses semiotic approaches to program-

discusses narrative and aesthetic issues of

the cultural, organizational, and historical

Thousands of languages and .
millions of words
proliferate in the world.
Yet non-verbal communication
sometimes drives home the
most powerful message.
Sin
Larrguage
Knowing how to read the signs, both verbal
and non-verbal, can make a difference in
the international business deal. Or a cross
cultural marriage. Or a multilateral treaty.
You&apos;ll find the keys in Linguistics and Language
Behavior Abstracts (LLBA).
It&apos;s about word use and abuse. About the rapid
evolution of language. And how communication
shapes our lives. Idl
In LLBA you&apos;ll find abstracts of scholarly articles and
books as well as bibliographical entries for book and
other media reviews and dissertations.
Think of LLBA as a sign of the times.
LLBA is available in print; online from Knight-Ridder; on CD-ROM from SilverPlatter and NISC;

Guidelines for Submissions
</table>
<note confidence="0.7567908">
Manuscxripts for Computational Linguistics should be submitted on letter-size paper (8.5 by
11 inches, or A4), double-spaced and single-sided throughout, including footnotes and refer-
ences. The paper should begin with an informative abstract of approximately 150-250 words.
Manuscripts must be written in English. Contact the editor regarding the possibility of electronic
submission.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.938912">
Submissions may be made in any of the following categories:
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9957355625">
Papers: This category includes contributions that report significant new research results in com-
putational linguistics or that provide critical reviews of the literature on a particular topic. The
length of a paper depends on its content, but it is suggested that manuscripts be limited to forty
double-spaced pages. That is the equivalent of thirty journal pages. Each paper is fully refereed,
being read by at least two members of the editorial board and usually by an additional expert
in the particular subject area. The submission of an article to CL for refereeing means that the
author certifies the manuscript is not copyrighted; nor has it been published or submitted for
publication to another refereed journal. If any version of the paper has appeared, or will appear,
in a non-refereed publication, the details of such publication must be made known to the Edi-
tor at the time of submission. The final version of a paper tentatively accepted for publication
must be accompanied by a Copyright Transfer Agreement signed by all of the authors or, in the
case of a &amp;quot;work for hire,&amp;quot; by the employer. This written transfer is necessary under the 1978
U.S. Copyright law.
Letters to the Editor: This category includes statements of opinion on issues relevant to the
readership. The Editor and the editorial board will evaluate the appropriateness of these con-
tributions for inclusion.

Founded in 1962, the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) is the primary scientific and
professional society for natural language processing research and applications. A European chapter was
established in 1982. Besides publishing Computational Linguistics, the ACL holds international meetings
(annually in North America, biennially in Europe) where the state-of-the-art in natural language
processing research and development is presented. Recently, special interest groups on the Mathematics of
Language, the Lexicon, Parsing, Generation, Computational Phonology, and Multimedia Language
Processing have been formed; others are likely to be added.
